  hyza is owned by the czech company agrofert . 
  100 % of agrofert 's stocks are owned by the czech finance minister andrej babi\u0161 . 
  ** edit : ** i 'm sorry , this happened to not be true . 
  i read it on the czech news website owned by andrej babi\u0161 ( lol ) . 
  the truth is that they sold the truck a year ago . 
  this information was n't immediately available . 
  thanks for understanding . 
  in the czech republic , you have to be 18 years old to buy and drink alcohol . 
  personally , i ca n't drink and i 'm not interested , but lot of czechs drink beer . 
  you correctly said one by leftists . 
  right-wing skinheads are more stupid and dangerous haha, 
  cool , he had to win election to not to go to jail . 
  okay , let 's point out this : almost every single time when these '' not fascists or xenophobics '' have demonstration it becomes violent demonstration and police has to react . 
  these far-right people are dangerous tho . 
  that 's not possible . 
  belarus ' president is often called '' the last dictator of europe '' maybe if the president gets changed . 
  officially not but if you look at putin 's palace which costs probably more than $ 1b he is considered as one of the richest russians but not officially because he gained his wealth of corruption and clientelism http://assets6.thrillist.com/v1/image/1194313/size/tl-horizontal_main_2x/a-look-inside-vladimir-putin-s-rumored-1b-secret-palace, 
  what type of question is this ? 
  of course my flag --  https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cb/flag_of_the_czech_republic.svg/800px-flag_of_the_czech_republic.svg.png, 
  yes , uber is perfect . 
  god damn , you have absolutely no clue what you 're talking about . 
  every country has right to revoke schengen area agreement and maintain border controls . 
  and also please note that so-called sanctions what is impossible since the czech republic is a member of eu will hit economical germany as well as poland , slovakia , austria , france etc. 
  oh , do n't embarrass two great countries - czech republic and japan . 
  tomio okamura is a shame and threat to europe and czech society . 
  take it easy , refugees ( not economic ) deserve better life !, 
  we should show solidarity . 
  yes , but when a politician is suspected of corruption 99 % people will say he is corrupted without even being put before court and eventually being sentenced . 
  politicians are seen differently than rest of us , you have to acknowledge that . 
  of course i know they 're humans too , it 's just a title , chill . 
  last time when swedes visited us , they stole our whole art and everything . 
  yes , totally agree , this guy does n't know what 's going on . 
  he is not embarrassment only for himself , he is embarrassment for your intelligence agencies and your country too . 
  i bet he does n't have access to the most classified documents ( i hope ) because of his [ chief of staff who does n't have a freaking security clearence ] ( http://www.radio.cz/en/section/curraffrs/czech-presidents-chief-of-staff-under-pressure-to-quit ) !, 
  as a czech , for me zeman is a total embarrassment . 
  this guy has no clue what he is talking about like you give people who are running away from assad guns and tell them go fight isis . 
  is this even possible ? 
  i mean , yes many low intelligent people will like this and they actually suggest this but he 's a president , head of state he should n't act like populist politician who wants to be elected for the second term . 
  this is not a videogame , you do n't have 2 sides - in syria you 've got more than 30 groups fighting each other . 
  fucking non-sense , fucking not eligible to be a president , fuck zeman . 
  ok , i 'm too lazy to reply to you by my own words but lets do it . 
  there are rumours that zeman 's campaign was sponsored from russian money . 
  one of his advisers is martin nejedl\u00fd ( google him but results will probably be only in czech ) is 1 . vicechairman of zeman 's party called [ spoz ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/party_of_civic_rights ) and also secretary of lukoil aviation czech - subsidiary of russian [ lukoil ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lukoil ) . 
  by the way this is nejedl\u00fd 's phone case [ here ] ( http://neovlivni.cz/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/boubin.jpg ) . 
  back to the story : the lukoil aviation czech is at disposal by the court ruling because of debts . 
  [ 1 ] ( http://www.respekt.cz/fokus/nejedleho-lukoil-aviation-je-v-likvidaci ) there is another man , vratislav myn\u00e1\u0159 , chief of staff of the office of the president of the czech republic who served as chairman of spoz ( zeman 's party ) . 
  being chief of staff means you have an access to the nato meeting , prepare delegations and stuff . 
  for this you have to have security clearance . 
  he does n't have one even though he submitted his request 2 years ago and [ national security authority ] ( http://www.nbu.cz/en/ ) rejected it . 
  [ 2 ] ( http://www.radio.cz/en/section/curraffrs/czech-presidents-chief-of-staff-under-pressure-to-quit ) yes , he is pro-european but only if russia will be in the eu : if you want to get to know him better wait until january 8 : http://uatoday.tv/society/new-documentary-czech-friends-of-the-kremlin-gets-first-screening-in-ukrainian-capital-556061.html, 
  maybe [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/milo\u0161_zeman#criticism_and_controversies ) will help you understand . 
  he is mainly supported by older people , radical groups and pro-russian people who believe in conspiracy theories . 
  i would n't say that academics and rectors are dumb . 
  maybe , i have n't been to romania yet so i do n't know . 
  i 'm referring to zeman 's policies not to greek-russian relations . 
  here , in the czech republic it is public secret that zeman is a pro-russian and putin bought him . 
  i believe that these individuals will eventually get the information that he is a pro-european politician and as you know many czechs do n't like eu . 
  lol ponta campaigning, 
  but your parliament building is glorious . 
  we 're so sorry greek friends , our so-called president who is putin 's puppy is stupid and has no diplomacy skills and ethic . 
  he is just old man funded by russian money . 
  we promise we will elect somebody more eligible to replace him . 
  with love , czechia < 3, 
  no , just only if slovenia passed the law allowing jailing people for being gay for example . 
  i 'm just assuming because parties will probably not reach a coalition agreement . 
  if marxistic pedemos takes over the country it would be pretty fucked up, 
  just for the specific state . 
  i know but he is very different than others popes in things like gay marriage etc. 
  so i just assumed . 
  oh eh did n't know about it , sorry, 
  i 'm centre-right wing voter of [ ods ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=ob\u010dansk\u00e1_demokratick\u00e1_strana&amp;redirect=yes ) and i 've got nothing against the same sex marriage . 
  today 's pope is a liberal tho, 
  i do n't think so . 
  i guess all the members of the european union have civil law system and the central government has much bigger role than in the us or canada which means the parliament only approves the bill and there 's constitutional court that could stop the bill . 
  cuz european integration, 
  austria looks like a sperm to me, 
  house of cards : polish edition, 
  better to be merkel 's lapdog than putin 's dickhead in the prague castle . 
  as a czech , russians should be closer to me cuz we both are slavic but for me they ai n't . 
  they took our freedom after world war ii for 40 years , they spread propaganda and try to influence us . 
  they killed more than 8k people in ukraine . 
  so for me turkey is much closer , we 're allies in nato . 
  maybe it would n't have to happen if your president was n't authoritarian monster trying to censorship the media . 
  what the fuck ?!, 
  you 're all polish , why do n't you speak your language lol :d i find this hilarious and funny , awesome poles !, 
  i 'm glad that us will also contribute as the biggest economy in the world . 
  there are differences between conservatism and liberal conservatism . 
  this is southern europe .

  what is german redditors opinion on this ?

  for those that did n't read this correctly : this ** is n't opinion poll of the people of the nation states ** but of meps of their respective countries .

  [ mmm yeah ] ( https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/bowwowtimes-new/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/sleeping-on-back.jpg ), 
  for the sake of comparison to american school system , i 'd say gymnaziums are pretty much equivalent of american high schools . 
  the concept , the subjects and the goals and vision . 
  and just like with high schools , if you only have gymnazium are highest reached education , you 're fucked on the job market , 
   more than half of them have slavic names , so i guess we 're doing alright regarding immigration . 
   this sums up why v4 countries are generally unhappy about the migration crisis . 
  we export hot women and all we 're supposed to be getting in return is more dudes . 
  send nudes plz . 
   do you have this kind of categorization , or do you throw everyone in one school like the u.s. does ? 
  standard high school ( it 's not default , but it comparest the best to american high school in subjects , concept , goals and vision - and no specialization ) in cz can have 3 different lenghts : * 4 years ( standard ) , * 6 years ( extended ) and * 8 years ( maximum ) . 
  the extra years are taken from elementary school span , so the longer high schools are seen as more advanced or `` elite '' because they effectively replace elementary education with high school education - more subjects , languages , projects etc. 
  you take entry exams while you attend elementary school and if you make the quota , you change schools . 
  the exams are fairly tough for the 8 year high schools and require consistent preparation ( which is not something a 10 year old is used to ) . 
  then there are specialized high-schools that are always 4 years . 
  common ones are : * language school - study puts stress on learning foreign languages , mandatory is at least czech + english + 2 other languages ( otherwise high school standard is czech + english + 1 other language ) * business academy - introduces statistics , bookkeeping and accounting , graduates are able to become accountants . 
  * hospitality school - for anything gastronomy , service and hotel management related * health school - for nurses and/or preparing for medical university and then smaller fields that also have dedicated high schools - art school , veterinary school , gardening school , agriculture school , fisher school and trade schools . 
   i 've always heard that germans do n't have a sense of humour germans are hilarious , but only with friends and family ( and sometimes work colleagues ) . 
  you have to hang out with more germans , you 're missing out . 
   i guess it was just an immature judgement of mine we all come here to learn something new , so do n't beat yourself up   based on the strong anti-immigration stance in czechia that 's also not completely true . 
  while the percentage of foreigners is not nearly as high as western european countries ( ~ 4 % ) , i can honestly say i know nobody who has an issue with our biggest minorities - vietnamese , ukrainians and russians . 
  even foreigners who do n't learn the language are not looked down upon much . 
  my own wife is an obvious foreigner and everybody loves her , including my grandparents . 
  that being said - those foreigner groups are either legal immigrants , or `` grey '' immigrants who work here but have no residence permit . 
  czech public is strongly against the last group - illegal immigrants , of which there is almost nobody here . 
  against people who try to smuggle themselves into the country and/or abuse the social system that works here . 
  that 's not necessarily my own opinion , but my perception of the opinion of the public as i hear and read about it . 
   czechia is leftist by american standards ? 
  can you expand on why you think that ? 
  before i begin - czech social democrats are what bernie sanders tried to push . 
  czech communists are , well , communists , there is no equivalent in the american politics . 
  czech right wing is hillary & co. . social democrats have been the ruling party about 60 % of the time after the revolution and have always been the biggest party - had most prime ministers , too . 
  even at this time , they are in the ruling coalition ( together with another center-left party ) . 
  current president is a former social democratic prime minister . 
  communists get about 15 % of votes consistently . 
  right winged parties only reach about 5-10 % according to polls . 
   i 've always seen the v4 countries as fairly conservative compared to the us i seriously have no clue where you picked that up . 
  also , do n't throw us together into one bag with poland and hungary , we are not in the same place politically . 
  fucking czechs , they just wo n't stop colonizing everything and declaring war on everyone !, 
   i 've discovered this sub quite recently . 
  we 're glad to have you \u2665, 
  i know , what i wrote earlier is some serious utopia . 
  some countries have military basically wired into their culture . 
  can you imagine russia without powerful military ? 
  that 's barely even possible , because it 's their national pride . 
  so if russia has a military , its neighbors will one too . 
  and since there 's a shitload of military in one region of the country , that 's a potential risk to everyone , right , so everyone now needs a military . 
  of course it 's not just russia 's fault everyone has a military  but de-militarizing the globe would always hit serious obstacles like this . 
   except ( and sorry ) mostly from central and eastern european posters in / r/europe , it 's certainly changed my opinion of their societies and people from there i for one have a big problem with gay men . 
  i do n't know about other european gays , but czech gay men are fucking gorgeous . 
  all of those i met could go straight to modelling . 
  it makes us , the hairy , smelly , average alcoholic heteros look bad . 
   europe all have their own problems , setbacks , in addition to benefits and positive aspects . 
  i got to learn about a ton of fascinating cultural idiosyncrasies and facts that i would n't learn anywhere else . 
  maybe if every human being was curious about other cultures , instead of bombing each other to smithereens , we could actually live with each other . 
  imagine what we could globally do with the money that goes into military upkeep and wars every year . 
  it 's a shame really that most people are too focused on their own little box to have a peek how 's it going in their neighbor 's cube . 
   it discovered the americas , the 14th century equivalent of striking oil , and was able to build a strong enough army , unhindered by philosophies that prohibits military engagement , which allowed it to gain more wealth and grow their economies ? 
  [ tfw ] ( http://i1.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/006/077/so_good.png ) none of this applies to your country . 
   how representative of your country is this sub ? 
  i always try my best to answer as unbiased as possible . 
  however , i am fairly well educated , fairly well off and fairly successful . 
  it 's hard for me to voice opinions of people who live in the country side or live off social support - and those people often have pretty hardline opinions . 
   you 're mostly young men who lean left . 
  by american standards , definitely , by european , not so much . 
  however , i 'd say good deal of the posters here fit comfortably into `` centrist '' category that rules in many european countries . 
   yes . 
  although uk government is to blame too since they could have put transitional controls in place . 
  to be honest , i 'm not sure why these restrictions were not adapted in the uk in the first place . 
  it 's not like it could not be foreseen that uk would become a prime target for inter-eu immigration . 
   czechia has no control over freedom of movement either . 
  ironically , czechia gets almost exclusively outside eu immigration . 
  ukrainians , vietnamese , russians . 
  so restricting open job market or freedom of movement would n't do anything for cz . 
  if immigration was recognized as an issue in cz ( currently it is not , save for illegal immigrants ) , we 'd be looking at a completely different issue than what uk had/has . 
   because a lot more immigrants come to the uk than to czechia . 
  [ three times as many ] ( http://one-europe.net/user/files/abc/immigrants.jpg ) that being said , it is not true eu countries can not influence migration independently from eu . 
  many countries have had limited job market access for new joins and some continue to do so for the poorest ones . 
  but if your government does not implement these limitations , allows full job market access to everyone and then complains about '' * too many poles living here * '' , what 's eu supposed to do ? 
   we would have a more integrated europe economically / practically speaking and brexit would n't have happened . 
  i 'm guessing you 're trying to say that if only wealthy countries were admitted or there was no open job market with newly admitted less-wealthy countries , brits would be pro-eu ? 
   if europe was a sitcom what character archetype is your country ? 
  czechia is the attractive party girl who works an average office job . 
   who do you interact with ? 
  best friend slovakia with whom she was married for a long time but decided to * just be friends * . 
  it kind of works but it seems lately slovakia is doing much better nowadays than she thought she would without her . 
  big bro poland who always seems to be more confident , louder and constantly switches between happy and depressed . 
  friendly neighbors germany and austria , with whom czechia slept at some point but nowadays everyone prefers to pretend that never happened . 
  they still hang out though , even though they do n't completely understand each other . 
  and about every single other nation who ring czechia 's doorbell when they 're drunk and want to party and heard she 's the girl to party with . 
   who do you have conflict with ? 
  she keeps her distance from russia , because she 's also an attractive party girl , but is more popular and is a bit of queen bee .

  ) ~ ~ nope it 's * nizozemsko * according to wikipedia . 
   i would like to vote for pro-european party but with tough anti-immigration policy from third countries . 
  these parties are non-existent yeah , i feel like many parties open their program with '' * we need to control immigration from 3rd countries , we need better background checks ... * '' and then go full-extremist with '' * ... also we should leave eu , exit nato and befriend russia !, 
  * '' going from reasonable political opinion to economical suicide and isolationist politics .

  i know only a single person in my generation ( 20s-30s ) who is a fan of russia and is a putin apologist . 
  i kind of blame people 's memories of playing tricks on them . 
  the older generations grew up during socialism and it 's easy to have fond memories of time when you were young , healthy and strong , when you chased girls , made friends ... 
  the way i see it , people forget the bad parts and only see the good ones . 
  my family lost property worth of hundreds of millions czech crowns , yet somehow my parents still vote communists , because it was better ( ** ???

  do n't say shit about german bread or they 'll break your face . 
  look man , i like silly fun . 
  if i did n't , i 'd say something like '' * you broke rule 1.7 * '' , remove your post and be done with it . 
  but what 's up with the implication that europeans are indistinguishable from `` gay '' or reminiscent of the stereotypical feminine portrayal of gays ? 
  because in some countries some men are more fashion-aware than in yours ? 
  well , okay , so europeans in general are more environment conscious and do n't drive hummers to work and they ca n't buy assault rifles in the shops . 
  does that make us wusses , and does that make you * real men * ? 
  anyway , you seem like a nice person . 
  why not use a week or two to travel to europe , maybe some of the more `` manly '' countries like the balkans , where a few years ago people were executed on the streets for their ethnicity , or ukraine , where people try to blow each other 's brains out for independence every day ?

  you know , my grandfather smoked his whole life . 
  i was about 10 years old when my mother said to him , ` if you ever want to see your grandchildren graduate , you have to stop immediately . ' . 
  tears welled up in his eyes when he realized what exactly was at stake . 
  he gave it up immediately . 
  three years later he died of lung cancer . 
  it was really sad and destroyed me . 
  my mother said to me - ` do n't ever smoke . 
  please do n't put your family through what your grandfather put us through . '', 
  i agreed . 
  at 28 , i have never touched a cigarette . 
  i must say , i feel a very slight sense of regret for never having done it , because your post gave me cancer anyway . 
   knowing you 're a mod made it even weirder . 
  :d hold on mate , i was calling people cunts long before i became a mod here now that i think about it . . !, 
   do you take pride in your military ? 
  there 's not much to be proud of . 
  we have whopping 23 000 active soldiers , a few tanks from the cold war era , a few overpriced apcs that keep falling apart a few dudes deployed in afghanistan and a pretty good chemical weapons unit . 
  everybody knows an army of this size and equipment could n't defend against anything but nobody cares enough to do anything about it . 
   do you have special holidays for them ? 
  thank you , cunt . 
  man , that is a weird sentence to say to express gratitude to someone . 
  no flag flair , but sounds like uk . . ? 
  i 'd say a lot of people here see poland as a bigger , stronger country , that fended for itself even against a more powerful foes , even if the outcome was not all that . 
  whereas in czech history , rulers would often yield or accept being a part of someone else 's kingdom/country/union / whatever , poles are seen as the one who stand their ground and fight . 
  fyi , eu citizens who move to germany and apply for hartz iv do contrary to the popular belief ** no claim ** to any kind of support , be it monetary or in form of lowered rent or anything like that . 
  you can apply , but unless you have worked for a period of time in the country , you will not get anything . 
  thanks for the effort for writing this down , i enjoyed reading it a lot . 
  refreshingly honest post . 
  i hear ya , cheap products are definitely being bought by companies here , i understand the exporter and the importer . 
  i also understand that a common polish citizen has fuck all to do with decisions of one or more food producer company about what they put in their stuff or what they sell altogether . 
  however , i ca n't wrap my head around how any company can use industrial salt ( the kind that is used to removed snow from sidewalks in winter ) in meat and salami , hide this information and lie about it when exposed , followed by being defended by the polish ministry . 
  germany * major trade partner and owner of our beloved skoda * germans make for tourists that are about as bad as brits and russians . 
  so - pretty bad . 
  it 's a funny contrast to how orderly germans behave in their own country .

   why is this preferred in some places rather than the monarchy . 
  monarchy is for the most part an ancient system in place to keep one family of people in power and if another would take their place , they 'd have to murder/conquer their way there . 
  the several remaining royal families in europe are mostly there as a nod to the tradition , not to exercise power . 
  monarchies in europe have historically been responsible for all kinds of nasty shit , ranging from family murder , waging wars for petty reasons , exploiting the laborers reminiscing of slavery and complete control over the populations . 
  that 's not something that belongs into the 21st century , perhaps save for saudi arabia . 
   but if you are going to have a prime minister be the real person in charge , why not have a monarch ? 
  because we 'd like to have some political system in place to elect our representatives . 
  monarchs do not get elected , they elect themselves . 
   someone who wont go into politics like a president might , represent you and the country , not a party . 
  european presidents often do not represent any party . 
  i have twice ( it was very near one of my universities ) , it 's been a while so it may have changed since , but i quite enjoyed it . 
  you can have a look at the pictures of the [ interior here ] ( https://www.google.de/search?q=prague+opera ) . 
  one more addendum to my original post - you 'll likely spend a lot of your time in the historical center , so prague districts 1 and 2 , aka old town and new town . 
  in those places , 95 % of people on the street are tourists or foreign businessmen , as locals avoid the loudness and crowdiness of the place . 
  as such , you may struggle to find someone to advise you or answer your questions . 
  in that case i recommend asking : * people in information kiosks * shopkeepers * policemen avoid shady salesmen , especially those in front of exchange offices . 
  if someone approaches you on the street , they either want your time or money , locals do not small talk in public with strangers . 
  you 're not obliged to answer to anyone so just keep walking .

  ah , here 's the daily '' * is europe in flames ? 
  * '' thread !, 
  op , if this subject interest you , i recommend using the search function in the sidebar . 
  you 'll find many answers in addition to what you get here . 
  short answers to your questions from me : 1 ) no-go zones do not exist . 
  there have been some incidents with police in two or three neighborhoods in sweden , right wing caught on that and now every poor neighborhood in europe gets called a no-go zone . 
  these have been here before the latest immigration wave . 
  2 ) do n't know about all countries , but in germany most of the refugees have not found work for one reason or another . 
  firstly , it takes forever to get the paperwork to allow you to work . 
  secondly , they do n't speak german and as such their benefit to the economy is limited . 
  thirdly , many come from a very low education background and can not perform jobs in the `` german standard '' . 
  this is a marathon , not a sprint , so what matters is everyone gets sent on the right way , learns the language , learns useful skills and then does not live in a ghetto of his own countrymen . 
  3 ) i doubt me or most people here are qualified to answer that .

  then i realized it 's pretty much the same thing as old men dating 30 + years younger supermodels , and no one is bothered by those anymore . 
  so eh . 
  if it works for them , who am i to judge . 
  it 's the result of the bizzare relationship the modern left has with islamism . 
  it 's not limited to swedish politics . 
  the center is expensive tourist trap . 
  it 's still pretty cheap once you wander off the beaten path . 
  ah , i guess it 's not so bad idea then . 
  i just find it sad what is happening to my favorite italian city . 
   crazy politics there is no other kind in here . 
  does n't venice have much bigger problems than kebab stores ? 
  like its population moving away and the city itself turning into giant disneyland ? 
  if serbia is mississippi , which country is alabama ? 
  i think hor\u00e1\u010dek has too much of an ego for people to vote for him . 
  draho\u0161 , however , would and will be my choice . 
  he is the only person who i could imagine having as a president . 
  he just needs more public space . 
  on the contrary , i think pm came out as a winner from this one . 
  zeman was trying to humiliate him , and it backfired horribly , literally every politician except babi\u0161 were criticizing him for the theater in the prague castle and lined up behind sobotka . 
  and now with the leaked recordings of babi\u0161 manipulating the media , both him and zeman are under heavy political pressure , which allows sobotka to kick babi\u0161 from the ministry post without it making him look like a victim . 
  and there is nothing zeman can do about it now , other than spit venom through his speaker . 
  really though , i am impressed how the `` meek '' sobotka managed to out-intrigue the master-schemer himself ( zeman ) in this . 
  i do n't mind it . 
  literally every other european language already referred to as in some version of `` czechia '' . 
  if there is one decision i do n't mind , it 's this . 
  well , many people here still insist on using `` republic '' when casually talking about their country , so ... 
  i honestly have no idea why you 're being downvoted . 
  it 's not like everyone here is an atheist , contrary to popular belief . 
  he 'd consider it pretty prudish , probably . 
  is this real ? 
   zeman , though , had more to say . 
  in an apparent deliberate act of humiliation , he told sobotka he was accepting his resignation . 
  he thanked sobotka for his work and asked the government to remain in place until he appoints a new prime minister . 
  this is important bit . 
  in our country , it 's unwritten rule that when pm quits , the whole government ends as well . 
  up until now , it seems . 
  zeman hates sobotka 's guts , and it seems he wants to use this situation to get rid of him and put his own man in charge of the current government . 
  the whole ceremony was basically zeman 's attempt to make our pm sobotka look like an idiot , during live broadcast . 
  which hilariously backfired when sobotka managed to turn the unexpected situation around and make zeman leave the hall full of journalists , giving him free room to explain his intention and call the president out . 
  anyway , this shitshow was something unheard of even to our country . 
  it was really stunning display of arrogance on zeman 's part . 
  the worst thing is i am not even surprised . 
  eu lacks spine to go through with such things . 
  [ til who are pomaks ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pomaks ), 
  i wonder how much he would start screaming if eu did terminate the turkey 's accession talks as a response . 
  so it 's even worse . 
  they 're idealists . 
  as if there was any image left to ruin . 
  it 's called populism . 
  i have no idea , really . 
  i refuse to even acknowledge that possibility . 
  it 's the best decision he could do . 
  any other would either turn babi\u0161 into martyr or made himself look like an idiot . 
  now whether it 's the best decision for the country , on the other hand ... 
  what a shitty source . 
  well , he is the only one being honest about it . 
   as a state , russia is immensely wealthy . 
  the problem is majority of this wealth never reaches people that are not putin 's cronies . 
  it 's that the europe has strong tradition of unions and people here generally do not take kindly to abuse by their employees . 
  which is exactly what em is doing . 
  i thought we already moved on from the idea that fence = literal nazism ? 
  i guess it 's partly the naive idea that accession process will help transform the countries into western democracies . 
  they do n't realise you have to change the mindset of people first . 
  as the old commie saying goes : `` he who does n't steal , steals from his family . '', 
  even here many politicians view eu as a free money machine to enrich themselves and their buddies and a comfy place to spend the rest of their political carreers , nothing else . 
  people need to vote him out in the next election . 
  all voice , no people .

  it did not change .

  but all of those weapons had to circulate somewhere legally first , that is , weapons on the street and stolen ones originally had legal owners too , in all likelyhood . 
  https://bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/fuo.pdf http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/guns/procon/guns.html, 
  well , if it creates a new magical right to hold weapons and a duty for citizens to participate in public security , then it has n't been in the system up to now , and it is changing the present system . 
  then you ca n't agree with this constitutional amendment , because it changes the system . 
  you are comparing the incomparable , because definitions of gun crime and its recording differs wildly across countries . 
  we ca n't really tell how do we relate to the uk . 
  you 're also getting to the root of the problem `` gun rights '' . 
  now we have a constitutional right to hold weapons , it 's no longer an issue of sane policy and public safety , now it 's a magical right to have a potential murder weapon in your house . 
  one which , if we learn anything from the experiment of us widespread weapons holding , protects absolutely no one . 
  it 's a mad experiment undertaken for the sake of political marketing . 
  edit : moreover the constitutional amendment also gives everyone the duty to safeguard public safety with weapons . 
  this is basically a call for vigilantism , and none of those will care about any `` in boundaries of the law '' small letters , just like they do n't care about the `` well regulated '' part in us . 
  very sad to see this happen . 
  we 're taking over all the wrong arguments and lessons from the us . 
  that happened in may , the russian special forces backed mafia was already terrorising people by april , see other posts including un human rights commissioner elsewhere . 
  by that time , it was nearly three months after the overthrow of yanukovich government , which was replaced by a government including minority members , many of whose ministers spoke russian , and a presidential campaign was taking place with russian native speaker poroshenko at the forefront . 
  these claims really only show how disconnected and brainwashed some people are and were by the russian television .

  no military invasion ? 
  why are you lying ? 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/russian_military_intervention_in_ukraine_ ( 2014 % e2 % 80 % 93present ) #crimea  no widespread terror except in the remaining part of ukraine . 
  united nations ohchr special envoy report from april 2014 : 7 . 
  in eastern ukraine , where a large ethnic russian minority resides , the situation remains particularly tense with ethnic russians fearing that the central government does not represent their interests . 
  although there were some attacks against the ethnic russian community , these were neither systematic nor widespread . 
  http://www.ohchr.org/documents/countries/ua/ukraine_report_15april2014.doc 18 june 2014 -- with united nations monitors reporting today that armed separatists have used killings , abductions and torture to instil a `` climate of intimidation and fear '' in [ occupied ] eastern ukraine , the world body 's human rights chief urged all armed groups to put down their weapons , end the violence and begin the process of long-term reconciliation . 
  the new report describes the breakdown of law and order in the areas held by armed groups in the country 's east -- with increasing evidence of abductions , detentions , torture , and killings -- as well as a number of `` worrying trends '' emerging in crimea . 
   started with repealing the regional languages law completely justifies a military invasion and widespread terror . 
  even if the repeal was vetoed by acting president . 
  so it never happened . 
   in order to make russians and russian speaking people second class citizens . 
  that 's a lie . 
  it reminds me of the way opposition towards masturbation was picked up by some islamic scholders . 
  islamic world simply keeps picking up western concepts . 
  you could argue it 's more like africa than middle east , but let 's not dwell on details . 
  culturally yes . 
  it 's been also presented as an article from a polish youth magazine , it 's quite believable but actually a modern parody . 
  business centers of asia more like . 
  there are not `` more muslims than belgians in brussels '' , babi\u0161 said it in future tense . 
  that 's the scaremongering joke . 
  we do not have to give asylum to everybody , and we especially do not have to give a right to reside to all family members . 
  the `` exponential growth '' of muslim populations is not happening : the fertility rate of muslims in western europe is 2.1 children per woman : http://www.pewforum.org/2015/04/02/europe/, 
  i like the freudian slip involved , where a territory of brotherly multinational federal republic of yugoslavia suddenly becomes a part of `` serbia '' . 
  sure enough , there was an ethnic cleansing going on in kosovo , but not in crimea . 
  how exactly do you presume european union is going to cause `` more muslims than czechs '' to live in czech republic ? 
  we already have thousands of arabs , tens of thousands of vietnamese and hundreds of thousands of foreigners . 
  we do not have to grant asylum to the seekers redistributed here , but pray tell me how will several thousand of them completely change our society into something new . 
  it 's absurd . 
  babi\u0161 is right unintentionally , because our crown currency is going to be for the foreseeable future still weakened by previous czech national bank exchange rate interventions that it has been carrying out up until some months ago . 
  czech crown will be strengthening substantially for years , after which it can be switched for euros at a more favourable rate . 
  however , he is also wrong saying `` euro is bankrupt '' because it 's stronger than ever before , and it would save us some money money on exchange risks and rates . 
  he 's reading the comments pages and buying into anti-europe propaganda too much . 
  and when he says `` it 's about our sovereignty '' it 's being his most insidious , it means he 's too craven to make an argument against popular sentiment as well as he fears that he would have to give up some of national executive power that is rapidly concentrating in his personal hands . 
  thrfre is regurgitating an argument he read in neviditeln\u00fd pes today , it 's amusing watching the confrontation of our comments pages with market reality . 
  does the rest of ukraine look like a country dominated by climate of fear with extrajudicial killings , abductions and torture ? 
  if you think the negativity towards russia is disproportionate , you should interest yourself in the history and going ons of these occupied territories . 
  ten thousand people died in this war that russia instigated and several million had to flee their homes . 
  millions of people find themselves in a dictatorial regime . 
  i am not sure how much is it of comfort to them , that possibly somalia is worse . 
  we 've been talking to them since ever . 
  has russia left ukraine alone yet ? 
  what sort of incentives do they have to do that ? 
  there needs to be a tangible reason for them , and anybody , not to do such horrible things , and sanctions are one way to do that . 
  18 june 2014 -- with united nations monitors reporting today that armed separatists have used killings , abductions and torture to instil a `` climate of intimidation and fear '' in eastern ukraine , the world body 's human rights chief urged all armed groups to put down their weapons , end the violence and begin the process of long-term reconciliation . 
  sure sounds like most countries . 
  russia actually invaded ukraine , annexed crimea , and its army units are fighting in the east of it known as donbas region . 
  it unlawfully occupies and maintains a dictatorship on the territory the size of netherlands and home to 7 million people . 
   everybody does this to foreign countries if they have the means and power to do it pis consolidating media in its hands is not an action in foreign countries , nor is german private investment a political influence operation by a rabid occupier dictatorship . 
  maybe you should just accept that democracies are not the same . 
   also we are in an economic crisis in most countries in europe no , `` we '' are not . 
  russia is though , for sure . 
   no one is a centrist when people do n't have any faith in the current future . 
  what cookooland is this from ? 
  depends on who you ask , for example pew says 10 % . 
  for our european readers : this is an actual contest . 
  it is not , cez is retroactively trying to deny their participation , but the temel\u00edn powerplant did host photoshoots , the girls were promised an internship at the powerplant , and the powerplant was promoting it on their own official facebook site , and their spokesman was defending it . 
  central europe already picked orb\u00e1n . 
  his anti-immigration hysteria has gained him many admirers and there 's no central european politicians criticising him over his consolidation of power . 
  polish pis is in the same boat , slovakia 's fico is having similar problems and also uses immigrants to distract attention and the czech government is in tow of the anti-immigration topic as well . 
  czech government moreover consists of andrej babi\u0161 and the social democrats . 
  andrej babi\u0161 is not quite the same level of authoritarianism , but the fact that he gets criticised by eu over his concentration and abuse of power is going to hardly make him any ally . 
  social democrats will be gone after the election . 
  macron on the other hand mostly entered headlines as being pro-refugees , anti-eastern workers , what 's to like for the commentariat that dominates our newspapers ?

  focus.de : 13th january unian : 15th january you claim the magical made up ukrainian gas blockade to be happening by 13th of january , my link is written on 15th january and yes , it describes the relevant events . 
  russia simply initially blocked deliveries to europe as a means of pressuring ukraine in a trade dispute , because it does n't understand the concept of law and arbitration . 
  then it feigned good will and proposed an impossible transit route . 
  ukrainians countered by offering another , viable transit route , that somehow russians been mysteriously unwilling to take . 
  cue lmolari dancing to the kremlin 's tune , upset because ukraine is `` blocking the deliveries '' . 
  focus.de is taken seriously by anybody ? 
  the russian company had proposed sending 98.8 million cubic meters of gas yesterday through ukraine , via the sudzha pumping station . 
  naftogaz wanted russian flows to be sent to the valuyki and pisarevka stations . 
  ukraine 's pipeline system would have been at risk of `` collapse '' if the nation had agreed to the request from the russian company , yushchenko said . 
  the route russia asked to use for transit was `` strange '' and would have cut off deliveries to four ukrainian provinces , he said . 
   but ukraine was shutting it down , too . 
  for example 2009 for two weeks . 
  no it has n't . 
  you are quite frankly just making things up , it was always russia shutting down supplies as a means of pressuring trade disputes . 
  http://www.nbcnews.com/id/28515983/ns/world_news-europe/t/europeans-shiver-russia-cuts-gas-shipments/ https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jun/16/russia-cuts-off-gas-supply-ukraine and it lost the most recent one , that coincidentally arose just when people have overthrown a pro-russian dictator , hmmm , strange thing , how does that happen ?

  i 'm secretly hoping the gop will stick to its good old strategy of `` if it came out of obama , it 's pure condensed evil '' . 
  everyone can be objective if they chose to be . 
   you 're leaning so far to one side , you can not be objective .

  dutch people , what do you say about this ?

  i just disagree with it .

  and i absolutely do * not * want to be more like the us .

  finally , such heavily important and far-reaching treaty * can not * be kept under total secrecy for this long .

  we 're not pretending to be something we 're not because it 's cool . 
  we just really do n't know how you can * honestly * believe in fairytales .

  people are confused and fooled by crazy scribblers for whom a human being teared apart by a terrorist is only abstract subject of news . 
  terrorists doing suicidal attacks definitely are not `` murderers plain and simpe '' and they are not only members of criminal community . 
  and this is the reason why prevent such people to murder us and prevent destruction our society we must apply many measures that would restrict our privacy and freedom for some time .

  we are sorcerer 's apprentices loosing control . 
  no , this is about gendrism - absurd and dangerous ideology presented as a science . 
  if it is so why equality ombudsman deals with it at all ? 
  i think it is necessary distinguish different terms and concepts called by it . 
  fascism is not islam . 
  german nazism was different from italian fascism or spanish franquismo . 
  bolshevik 's communism was very far from german nazism though both resulted in mass murdering . 
  if you do n't distinguish it these words became only aggressive invectives and you are prevented to see a core of problems . 
  discussion becomes an irrational quarrel . 
  if you say islam is fascism you do n't touch the problem , you swear only . 
  and it is the same as to call a racist somebody who is strongly negative to islam and its believers . 
  racism is not sorting and measuring people by religion but by biological characteristics . 
  you can say that islam is evil as fascism , but you should not say islam is fascism .

  most presumable scenario after brexit from central european view : brexit scottish independence referendum welsh independence referendum the scottish and welsh parliaments renounce the bill of rights ( 1689 ) as an act of religious discrimination calling a legitimate successor of james ii to throne franz , duke of bavaria , became king of scotland and wales as francis i. 
  he renames house of wittelsbach to house of stuart-whitebrook and renounces lederhosen in favor of kilt . 
  scotland and welsh became the united kingdom of british peninsulas ( ukbp ) . 
  francis i. as an important member of old german nobility starts negotiation of membership for ukbp in eu . 
  francis i. declares his right to the english throne and conquers all remaining non pakistani english towns and london 's quarters . 
  all houses of windsor and mountbatten flee on the gloriana barge to ulster in confusion and fear taking with them koh-i-noor and caryatide . 
  francis i. moves his residence to london formally justifying it by a declaration that multiculturalism is more bearable then midges . 
  in fact he is in fear of scottish clans .

  he also made serious mistakes sometimes . 
  for example he thought that the polka '' \u0160koda l\u00e1sky '' ( beer barrel polka / rosamunde / rosamunda / frida oum papa ... ) is a german folk song . 
  he also demanded czech republic to sell germany lobkowicz palais ( german emabassy is placed there ) , because it is an important building for german history . 
  after france sells them versailles for that happening in january 1871 , czech republic could consider it . 
  that brigade in six east nato countries is useless because russians are not dumb or crazy . 
  they do not want conquer poland or bulgaria . 
  they want to keep crimea and eastern ukraine and trans-dniestr . 
  they want only area where they have support of inhabitants . 
  but if usa try to gain control of crimea russians would use all means . 
  it is for them important as hawaii for usa . 
  i do n't understand again . 
  `` we have only to kick in the door and the whole rotten structure will come crashing down . '', 
  adolf hitler 1941 operation barbarossa failed ( moscow ) 1942 operation case blue ( fall blau ) failed ( stalingrad ) 1943 operation citadel failed ( kursk ) evacuation of factories -- example : two of three factories producing t34 in leningrad and stalingrad had to be evacuated . 
  factory in gorky produced without interruption . 
  it was not an argument . 
  he called me `` comrade '' . 
  i am not a communist , i am catholic , that 's all . 
  and i do n't understand why you write how many catholic are in russia . 
  i do n't understand . 
  i know history of ww ii quite well . 
  soviet army was weak in begining because stalin murdered thousands best officers in 1937 . 
  and they were surprised and in chaos . 
  if they were able to use all their force from beginning , they would have been in 1943 in paris , maybe in madrid too . 
  they had best tanks in 1941 , much better then anything that germans had , but the mass production was delayed because they had to move all factories in siberia . 
  i am catholic . 
  it is absurd argument . 
  when i was ten years old in one morning i woke up when my grandmother cried in street : `` wake up all , russians are here ! '', 
  in previous night hundred of thousands soviet soldiers invaded my country . 
  it was 21 . 
  august 1968 . 
  we live between germans and russians on strategical place and e know that both are freaks that is not good to underestimate . 
  why ? 
  it was only a very ilustrative example of underestimating russians . 
  german army was a very strong force in 1941 . 
  four million soldiers , three thousands tanks , four thousands aircrafts . 
  and mr. obama promises to deploy 1 brigade in 6 eastern nato countries . 
  you ca n't expand without a real force . 
  you ca n't promise ukraine what you are not able to do . 
  it is irresponsible . 
  it is difficult to believe how western politicians has underestimated russians . 
  and naive people follow them . 
  in 1941 hitler promised german soldiers they were soon parade on the red square . 
  when stalin let them do it in 1944 they were not happy . 
  why putin send his green guys to crimea ? 
  to prevent nato control it . 
  why is war in donbas ? 
  to prevent eu and nato to control it . 
  and what nato can do ? 
  make a very serious complaint !, 
  always full of respect to greek culture , bravery and cleverness i like to use their mythology . 
  abilities of mr. putin are evident from his all biography if you see it in the context of russian history after 1989 . 
  any current european politician would fail in three weeks in his role .

  this `` nobody had anything '' is exaggerated . 
  yes , there were no rich people ( save few cronies and handful of top artists ) but there were no poor people either . 
  in the czech part of czechoslovakia people from cities commonly owned a `` weekend house '' ( a house or a cottage in a village ) . 
  that 's not exactly sign of poverty . 
  and criminality . 
  in former czechoslovakia criminality was very , very low compared to today . 
  curiously enough , number of police ( both uniformed and plain clothed ) was somewhere betwen 1/2 - 2/3 of current staff and back then they had to handle passports and driving licences , today they do not . 
  people remeber full employment and very low criminality a compare it with rather catastrophic situation today . 
  nobody 's nostalgic after single party system or propaganda . 
  czech republic is not growing and even before the 2008 crisis the growth was anemic and mainly driven by debt . 
  actually , in recent years it fares worse than every neighbour . 
  criminality in prague is the [ highest ] ( http://www.prvnizpravy.cz/zpravy/z-domova/v-cesku-klesa-kriminalita-v-praze-se-krade-nejvic/ ) in the country and is dominated by foreigners . 
  most do n't care . 
  there are many worse problems related to eu than a piece of clothing hanging somewhere . 
  selling abroad cheaply ( or for negative price ) and buying from there for a high price . 
  what could possibly go wrong . 
  capacity of these plants in germany is about 7 gw . 
  that 's not enough to replace baseload power stations . 
  czechoslovakia does not exists on the map . 
  in reality there were some half-hearted diplomatic attempts to obtain [ kladsko/glatz/k \u0142odzko region ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/k%c5%82odzko_county ) back to czechoslovakia , possibly even improving defense against germany by moving the line down the border mountains . 
  silesia and bavaria was not even fantasized . 
  czechoslovakia also sent its troops to few czech inhabited villages in today 's poland ( around [ ratibor ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/racib%c3%b3rz ) ) in 1945 , the intention was to annex them . 
  the coming war was avoided because stalin said `` fuck you '' and cz army returned home . 
  the same happened with many barracks of czech ( oslovak ) army . 
  once massive army ( 200 thousand strong in 80s ) was decimated during the 90s and left many locations . 
  buildings there were invariably looted and devastated . 
  it was extremely chaotic time - huge sums were invested into military projects that failed but buildings were left to rot and then sold out for pennies . 
  software had managed to eliminate some skilled desk jobs and replace them with unskilled ones . 
  instead of accountants who know their trade inside out you now have people who click buttons and have no clue what happens inside . 
  software has so far failed to eliminate desk jobs . 
  the * extremely stable czech banking sector * had collapsed during the late 90s and early 2000s ( dozens of banks went down , the second largest bank was nationalized overnight with heavily armed commandos breaking in to enforce it ) and had to be rescued by huuuge government money ( [ estimated ] ( http://www.novinky.cz/ekonomika/51177-zachrana-bank-a-podniku-stala-cr-600-miliard-korun.html ) to 600 billions of czk by finance minister in 2005 , numerically about 50 % of yearly state expenditure now ) . 
  the once mighty industrial base withered away . 
  this is a long story , i can expand on this . 
  nominal average wage does increase but the real wage ( adjusted to consumer prices ) keeps stagnant for last decade ( a relative success , during 90s it went down ) . 
  [ statistics ( in czech ) . 
  ] ( http://www.finance.cz/makrodata-eu/trh-prace/statistiky/mzda/ ) the export part of the economy is powered by low added value manufacturers who did n't found someone cheaper yet ( e.g. 
  foxconn which moved final assembly of computers here from ireland ) . 
  the high-value industry with own r&d mostly disappeared ( skoda car is notable large exception ) . 
  the debt was around 15 % of gdp in early 90s ( and slightly decreasing ) . 
  it is now over 43 % and growing very fast in recent years . 
  [ czech wikipedia page with graph ] ( http://cs.wikipedia.org/wiki/st%c3%a1tn%c3%ad_dluh_%c4%8cesk%c3%a9_republiky ) the only * positive * in current situation is that czech rep. serves as low-cost manufacturer for germany and their economy is not going down easily . 
    we already had to sink 1 billion of euros  so tired of this attitude . 
  i suppose this is why we ca n't have a nice union exactly . 
  dreams are dreams and do n't fit reality well . 
  and when such countries are simply not able to fix it ? 
  they you get bankrupt states and massive corruption . 
  i 'll tell you one consequence of entry of the czech republic into eu . 
  massive transfer of money from the eu resulted in giant corruption . 
  politically connected crooks suddenly started to rake in billions . 
  we got the costliest highways in europe ( and yet , after one year they need massive repair ) , bridges from nowhere to nowhere , huge money are wasted on idiotic programmes . 
  statistics and reports for the brussels are routinely cooked by local authorities . 
  some countries are culturally unfit for eu or euro and trying to push them there results only in disaster . 
  the czech economy is slowly but steadily deteriorating . 
  the times of plenty and stability are long over . 
  with euro we would be now in situation of the baltics - even higher unemployment , collapse of social services , mass emigration ( still very low among the czechs ) . 
  we would be paying hand over fist for greece ( we already had to sink 1 billion of euros ) . 
  euro may be advantage for highly developed countries like germany , finland or austria but not for states in decline as the czech republic . 
  it is disaster for the whole south europe and will likely spread further . 
  not just euro but policy of the brussels . 
  should countries like czech republic join the euro the overall situation would be even worse now . 
  in addition to greece etc they too would be bankrupt a begging for money . 
  well , you can not say it is success , ca n't you ? 
  when they joined eu they could n't know euro will become such a disaster . 
  only stupid people never react when circumstances change . 
  for information , this is a ( not very funny , imho ) cartoon with a czech language title saying : ' `` cyprus crisis as seen by [ cartoonist name ] '' . 
  and this did n't work either , at least in czechoslovakia . 
  the reality is a bit different then the title claims . 
  the law had changed very little , drugs were as big problem before as they are now . 
  what had however changed is the target . 
  due to long lasting economic problems of the czech republic the dealers found much more lucrative market - germany . 
  mafias , especially the vietnamese one , now export large amounts of drugs and the traditionally incompetent czech police ca n't do anything . 
  germans try to stop it , they routinely stop and search cars coming from the czech republic , for example . 
  yeah , because it works so well . 
  remember [ lisbon agenda ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lisbon_strategy ) ? 
   it was adopted for a ten-year period in 2000 in lisbon , portugal by the european council . 
  it broadly aimed to `` make europe , by 2010 , the most competitive and the most dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world '' . 
  europe has enough of its own problems . 
  i dare to generalize and say that nobody in the czech republic believes the president will be punished . 
  that 's just not the way things are done here . 
  only one czech politician has been ever put behind bars ( decade ago , minister of finance , for embezzling bank loan from a company , before he was named minister ) . 
  well , most of the czechs believe it is wrong . 
  because of current unemployment levels , criminality , less available health care and devastated education . 
  for them this much more important than philosophical discussions about `` collective systems '' . 
  they remember time when the above mentioned was working better , that 's all . 
  the opposite . 
  people suddenly remember time when education was free , everyone had a decent job and criminality was incredibly low . 
  there were many , many problems - chronic shortages of all kinds of consumer goods , for example - but current problems ( criminality and unemployment consistently top all surveys ) look much worse . 
  guaranteed healthcare and free education ( relatively good during communist era ) are slowly but steadily eroded in the czech republic . 
  even the czech social democrats want to limit them more and more , the other parties try to destroy public services completely . 
  even the czech republic , eurozone non-member , had already thrown 26 billion of czech crowns ( cca 1 billion of euros ) into greek sinkhole , in 2011 , through imf . 
  the political regime is irrelevant here . 
  they got decent jobs and children schools . 
  not even pure angels from heaven can realistically provide more . 
  the `` forced dispersion '' in today 's terminology means stop for ghettos full of criminality and poverty , only reworded to sound as a tragedy . 
  the infamous settlement chanov was designed to be a place where czechs and gypsies will live together in harmony , to serve as an example for the rest of the country . 
  it was n't that hellhole from the beginning , inhabitants had a well paying jobs ( mining areas were relatively prosperous ) and there was no ethnic violence back then . 
  only after the overthrow of communists and economical downturn czechs fled and the place became totally devastated . 
  they did what is now frequently claimed to be the universal medicine for their problems . 
  gypsies had to work ( and manual laborers were paid better than say teachers or technicians ) , kids had to go in school ( otherwise social benefits were cut ) and no ghettos were allowed to spring up . 
  you wo n't find a more sophisticated plan today .

  then i believe that 's possible , but obviously both sides will have to make concessions . 
  the uk may have to make a bit more concessions , because it 's the economicaly weaker partner in this relationship . 
  but hopefully it would still be mutually beneficial agreement . 
  however i do n't think requiring that the uk makes some concessions would mean punishing the uk . 
  i do n't think that it should be used as an argument to limit your nato activities . 
  nato is n't the eu . 
  nato is a completely separate organization and trying to diminish your position there would make no sense . 
  it is also in your interest to keep the european security enviroment stable , you benefit from it . 
  yep , i agree . 
  i do n't wish anything bad to the uk , but if they decided to go this way , then i 'd probably change my mind on this and would want the eu to take a punitive approach . 
  hopefully it wo n't come to this . 
  it 's sad to see the uk leaving us . 
  we can only hope that we 'll be able to reach a deal that is acceptable to everyone . 
  i see that may might try to use the uk 's security engagement in europe as a bargaining chip , but i would hate to see that . 
  nato activities are something that is n't connected with the eu and baltic countries do n't deserve to have their security jeopardized because of brexit . 
  well this specific spelling is only typical in the czech republic , so i guess it only applies here , 
  can confirm that we who have this name are all awesome , so i 'm not surprised about your good memories , 
   i 'm not really sure if your blood pressure was raised by my text or the article . 
  oh , i was talking about the article too . 
  basically i was agreeing with your post , but i see i probably articulated it wrongly . 
  the article really is a crap . 
  basically you could sum it up as ' i have very superficial knowledge of european history , but i did n't want to just write a boring article how prague is a pretty city , so i decided to mix some history in it and draw some `` insightful '' conclusions from it ' . 
  i 'm usually not the type of person that gets easily offended by some stupid shit foreigners say about my country , but i must admit , this managed to raise my blood pressure a little bit . 
  specially since when we look at those two situations when we really did surrender without fighting - in 1938 to nazi germany and in 1968 to soviets - both were completely hopeless . 
  the first time we were pressured into surrendering not just by germans but by all the major european powers and in the second we would be fighting against the world superpower and we would end up exactly like hungary in 1956 . 
  no problem . 
  you really can believe it . 
  it 's true that if we only considered the economic arguments , then the hn newsroom would probably be slightly anti-euro , however when we take into account the political arguments , then the dominant opinion would be pro-euro . 
  i actually had a 3-month internship in that newsroom , so i know how they operate and what is the general ideological background of the people working there . 
  and out of the 3 months i have not met with any practices concerning the `` regular '' articles that could be described as unethical . 
  and even when it comes to opinion articles , the general hn policy is to often present `` for '' and `` against '' pieces when it comes to major issues - such as the central bank interventions and so . 
  this does n't mean that they 're always objective in everything , but from my experience , the effort to do decent journalistic work is certainly there . 
  i do n't know if you really follow hn and aktu\u00e1ln\u011b very closely . 
  as i said , the idea that euro is very important for us from the political point of view is really very common in these media . 
   if the new members plan a takeover of the eu of course we do not plan to takover the eu , that 's ridiculous . 
  what i meant was that we do have the right to influence the direction of the eu , just like all other countries in the eu have this right . 
  it 's not a western european union . 
  we 're the eu as well and our views are valid and shoud be counted . 
   why you think you have the right to stop other members from integrating further beats me . 
  i have never said any such thing . 
  i said that we have the right to contribute to the discussion on how the eu should look like and how it should operate . 
  what will be the result of that discussion is a different thing . 
  i never said that our ideas and views have to be 100 % accepted by others , i just said that they should be taken into account . 
   this , you wo n't find in hn . 
  that 's not true , you have pro-euro opinions in hn as well . 
  i remember reading plenty of times in opinions columns of hn journalists that we should accept euro if not because euro is a good thing , then at least because we 'd be risking staying on the eu periphery - basically the attitude in [ this article ] ( http://archiv.ihned.cz/c1-65476370-prijeti-eura-nas-muze-udrzet-na-zapade ) is very common among hn/aktu \u00e1ln\u011b journalists . 
   it 's not unbiased newspaper . 
  of course it 's not , all commercial media in cz have biases . 
  i mean , do you read opinions pieces of hn/aktu \u00e1ln\u011b journalists ? 
  those are articles where you actually do n't have to look for any hidden bias , it 's the point of an opinion column to just clearly state an opinion . 
  and the vast majority of opinion columns in hn are pro-eu or pro-western in general . 
  on euro they are more nuanced , but i guess this tells you something about the euro/eurozone - that it is perhaps not as black and white , when even strongly pro-eu people are n't so ethusiastic . 
  plus people who write comments in hn usually have some economic background - it 's not like they are some totally uneducated morons usuing stupid nostalgic arguments ( i.e. 
  `` i just like how koruna looks better ) . 
  why do you think things like electoral college exist in the us ? 
  it 's precisely because when the us was forming , smaller states wanted to have equal say as the bigger states regardless of how populous they were . 
  nowadays the electoral college seems obsolate because there 's a shared american identity , but back then the situation was different . 
  and this is what the situation nowadays is in europe - most people identify with their countries first and will put their countries interests first . 
   in my view , full membership came for too early . 
  they want the advantages of the eu but have not accepted the values of the eu . 
  well we have different views , that 's for sure . 
  the new members states made different historic experience in the past century and this influences our attitudes and mentality . 
  western europeans decided to accept us into the eu and they might have not realized than in certain things the differences are rather significant , however that 's not our fault that we did n't ( and does n't ) have the interest to understand these differences better . 
  regardless , we 're now in and we have the right to present our positions and ideas how the eu should operate . 
  the eu is ours just like it 's yours . 
  we 're all obliged to maintain certain basic values , however we 're not obliged to fully accept everything that we wants and sees as right . 
  or you know , maybe the journalists in hn ( who btw . 
  tend to be very pro-eu , just like their collegues at aktu\u00e1ln\u011b , so it 's pretty silly to accuse them of any anti-eu bias ) decided to do an interview with a well known economist and this economist happens to have a negative opinion on euro . 
  i mean , what 's wrong with that , are economists not allowed to criticize the flaws of eurozone or what ? 
  romania meets all the formal conditions that are stated in treaty . 
  the reasons why romania and bulgaria are kept from schengen are political - some western european countries simply fear that it would increase the influx of romanians and bulgarians to their countries and they know that their electorate might not like that . 
   i would say it 's very difficult , since it can be used in both ways in the exact same sentence structure . 
  yeah , that 's what i was thinking , with some other modal particles , it 's easier to tell , because one might recognize it based on the structure of the sentence . 
  in this particular case though , that 's not possible . 
  so is there any way for a non-native speaker to be able to tell when it 's meant as a time adverb and when it 's just a modal particle ? 
  but the wiki article that you linked does n't mention a case where jetzt is used as a model particle . 
  it is not fucked up logic . 
  the surgery is n't causing pain to the rhinos and it is not pernament anyway . 
  the horns do grow back . 
  right now , the risk level is high and a zoo is n't the type of institution that would have financial means and the authority to run some full-armed security services . 
  and how else are you going to defend the rhinos against poachers who are armed ? 
  better to eliminate the chances of an attack completely by removing the reason why the poachers want to attack in the first place . 
  poor bavaria has to share a country with all the other bundesl\u00e4nder that just ca n't drink enough beer . 
  do n't know how you can put up with that . 
  and also poor us , because we do n't even have a proper competition in the beer per capita contest . 
  now , independent bavaria , that would be a strong opponent . 
  and you have this information from where ? 
  and while you 're at it , i 'd also recommend you to rethink immigration from mena , that also does n't seem to be a bastion of progressive values . 
  it started immediately , but as i said in another post , it took years before it was finalized , so czechoslovakia broke up before it was finished . 
  i 'd say it was about the mid 90s when the vast majority of pre-89 staff left . 
  what was happening in the early 90s was that the old institutions were dismantled and new were formed with new people in command . 
  new legislation was being created . 
  but the people not in the very top positions were only replaced or sidelined gradually , because we simply did n't have enough new skilled people that could replace them . 
  what happened in this whole period was that some of the new people who were put in charge turned out to be completely incompetent in doing their job , since they had zero experience with this type of work . 
  the secret services also had such a bad reputation ( because they were used as a tool to persecute people during that communism ) that people from the dissent did n't have any interest in joining them . 
  the situation was so bad that we even turned to the former reform communists that were purged from their positions in 1968 - these people had the experience and the interest to work in these positions and also disloyalty was not the immediate concern , because they obviously had no love for russia , since it was because of the russian invasion that they were purged in the first place . 
  however these people turned out to be pretty stuck in the cold war thinking , so they also were n't ideal for creating a new , modern net of intel services . 
  long story short , it was a mess . 
  it took a lot of blunders , affairs and scandals before the situation was stabilized . 
  however it was still better to do it this way than risking that we 'll have russian moles or people vulnerable to russian blackmail inside our secret services .

  coffee is not similar to nutella in the slightest . 
   quality differences are a problem the market can solve . 
  do n't buy shit that you do n't like . 
  that 's the reason why germany has good quality for low prices . 
  the market solved nothing thus far . 
  and if all you can buy is shit , you will buy shit , else you 'll starve . 
   if nutella changes ingredients many will buy something else . 
  if nutella raises prices , many will buy something else . 
  the cxos of ferrero , nestle and other multinationals are n't secret nazis that love germans and hate eastern europeans . 
  they love profits for the most part . 
  and they understand they can sell shit to ee at a margin , while they can not do the same thing in de . 
   not if that effort comes with tons of pointless bureaucracy . 
  as would be the case if companies were forced to sell the same product in all countries . 
  apologistic bullshit . 
  `` let 's not change things because change involves work '' . 
   the amount of red tape that we need to regulate this gets even worse if the product is produced in different countries by subsidies . 
  or to take it to the extreme , if it is produced by a local franchise . 
  there is no red tape to be had . 
  either sell the same exact product , or force the companies to label it differently . 
  nutella poland or coca cola croatia . 
   where do you draw the line ? 
  mcdonalds spain uses beef from spain . 
  mcdonalds france uses beef from france . 
  can the customer in spain complain because the beef he has to eat was produced with more antibiotics ( i.e. 
  inferior quality ) than the beef the french customer eats ? 
  can the mcdonalds customer in the netherlands complain because he has to eat greenhouse tomatoes that were grown in hydroculture while the one in spain eats tomatoes that were grown outdoors ? 
  yes . 
  yes and yes . 
  information about food intake is critical and * has * to be available to the customer at a moment 's notice . 
  if the spanish are being fed beef on antibiotics , then it is necessary to * say so * so that the customer can make an informed decision and vote with his wallet . 
  if you 're selling crap , then call it crap . 
   products of different quality is a problem the markets are perfectly capable of solving . 
  do you believe german customers get high quality food for low prices because all the businesses around the world love germans so much ? 
  or is it because german customers wo n't buy your stuff if you fuck with them too much ? 
  the markets have been running the show and solved * nothing * . 
  the companies are allowed to sell inferior products in eastern europe because there is no alternative . 
  if every product is inferior , and there is literally no reason for the product not to be inferior , considering the production costs are lower and profit margins higher , then the people have no alternative to choose from . 
  do you expect them to go hungry or dress in unwashed clothes ? 
   if ferrero germany wo n't sell to you , file a complaint with the eu because they discriminate . 
  there is no legislation that would force ferrero germany to sell anything to anyone , least of all proper german nutella to a polish retailer . 
  for all we know , ferrero has a million and a half reasons why polish nutella is shit . 
  really not an option if there is no foreign product to be had . 
  and crossing the border to do your daily shopping is not a viable option either . 
  but if your interest rates are * too high * to pay back without slashing funding , then what option is there ? 
   why would you borrow more and tax more ? 
  larger loans necessitate larger return payments . 
  import nuclear . 
  well . 
  spain has to have * something * going for it , so i suppose it 's alright . 
   liberal with that many religious nutjobs ? 
  hardly . 
   capitalist does the eu propagate state ownership ? 
   first time 1860 or 1945 ? 
  afaik the stance on privacy in slovakia is that as long as it can be observed from a publicly accessible location , then it is not protected by privacy law . 
  the exception is i believe when inside a dwelling . 
  meaning you can take a picture of someone sunbathing naked on his front lawn , but not of someone through the window when he 's showering . 
  in what way ? 
   irreligious it 's called atheist . 
  use any definition of democracy you like . 
  just take note that this statement :  it has been observed that systems which combine democracy , aristocracy and autocratic rule are more likely to lead a nation into greatness as well as preserve the liberty of citizens than democratic countries can not possibly be correct if your definition of autocratic democracy sustains opressive policies . 
   and my last point was that , since we 're arguing whether democratic states are inherently more humane than less democratic ones , even if you consider the pre-1965 voting rights act us an oligarchy my personal opinion wo n't affect the facts . 
  if you allow for a portion of your population to be disenfranchised based on things they have no control over , you are not living in a representative democracy . 
  does n't necessarily make it an oligarchy , patriarchy , triumvirate or whatever . 
  it simply means that liberties and freedoms are not being protected , and hence your original statement is refuted . 
   given that most would consider this to be an extraordinary claim i suppose i would too . 
  there 's nothing that stands out as oligarchy-like in pre 1965 usa . 
  does n't mean that people disagree with the act though . 
   you should be able to prove that the us would have treated the native americans better , were women and minorities allowed to vote . 
  i should ? 
  why ? 
  and how ? 
  it 's a self-contradiction . 
  the us funded american expansion into indian territories in the west because they were n't us citizens and had no protection . 
  you ca n't speculate on whether the california gold rush or the trail of tears would have happened had indians been a recognized voting base in the us , because they simply were n't . 
  fact of the matter is , that they were pushed out of their lands and tricked of their possessions because they were n't protected from us law ( for the most part ) . 
  speculating on what could have been is pointless . 
  i ca n't predict that . 
   it has been observed that systems which combine democracy , aristocracy and autocratic rule are more likely to lead a nation into greatness as well as preserve the liberty of citizens than democratic countries when 50 % of your population at minimum is oppressed , then you can not possibly say that an autocratic-democratic mix ( such as the british or roman empires , which were about as democratic as my left butt cheek ) preserves individual liberties in the broadest possible spectrum and/or best possible way . 
  or is it only about the liberty of those few individuals that tick a certain amount of boxes ( british , white , landowner , roman citizen , whatever ) that we should care about , and if for every 1 free citizen there exist 50 oppressed and suffering slaves/indentured servants , then it simply does n't matter , does it ? 
   so , if women voting and minorities voting and all that is a prerequisite for a democracy such a shocking and completely unreasonable request . 
  if men : women ratio is close to 50:50 , it stands to reason that half of the world 's population should n't be allowed to vote in matters of state !, 
  ( obligatory / s ) . 
  but if you think that women and minorities being allowed to vote has nothing to do with democracies , perhaps we should only allow people named `` jeff '' to vote . 
  it makes as much sense as any other restriction . 
   is the us now democratic , with their felony disenfranchisement laws ? 
  yes . 
  felons are disenfranchised based on their actions , not their race , gender or beliefs . 
  it stands to reason that being penalized for your own actions is different than being penalized for your existence . 
   when churchill said that thing about democracy being the best government tried , i mean how could he have said it . 
  unicorns are real . 
  there i said a thing . 
  quote me on it , make it important !, 
   you see where i 'm going . 
  if you want to you can fiddle with the deffinition of democracy untill any state that has practiced ethnic cleansing is undemocratic . 
  was n't the point . 
  the point was that a state that practices ethnic cleansing by definition * does not preserve individual rights and liberties of its people * . 
   unless you can prove that allowing black people and women to vote would have prevented ethnic cleansing of the indians , i do n't see why anyone should care . 
  random comment is random . 
   usa democracy rly ? 
  ever heard of landed voting ?

  here is [ a translation ] ( http://lyricstranslate.com/en/panubohu-do-oken-lords-windows.html ) . 
  you can look into their culture here / r/fifthworldpics / . 
  til how these intricate systems are called . 
  do you mean like [ a hydraulic press ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxxcbyahtv4 ) ? 
  yet the healthy ratio varies a lot and that depends on both sides . 
  i 'm just saying you have to focus on making more countries developed ( make the world more global ) , because right now number of people on this planet is still raising . 
  if you want to nonviolently reduce the total number of people . 
  and to what number should be the world population reduced ? 
  what 's optimal ? 
  going down this path , it has to be the whole world . 
  ok , in this scenario i find the fully globalized world as a prerequisite , at least very important . 
  how long it takes though ? 
  that 's like a trivial solution and thus it 's uninteresting . 
  and if you want to have less people , but still a non-zero count you have to have just a bump in the fertility rate . 
  i 've heard predictions that the world population converges to 11 milliards . 
  btw . 
  what does _ the world needs _ even mean ? 
  should the rate at which we wear off the planet earth be kept low or even lowered ? 
  why ? 
  to be able to escape the solar system before the death of the sun , to escape the universe before the heath death ? 
  what if we wo n't be able to do that due to a too low rate of wearing off . 
  here you have it sorted : country | # | per 1000 -- | -- | -- malta | 9984 | 23.1 liechtenstein | 808 | 21.6 cyprus | 15569 | 18.4 poland | 541583 | 14.3 sweden | 110623 | 11.3 united kingdom | 633017 | 9.7 luxembourg | 4918 | 8.6 ireland | 38433 | 8.3 denmark | 46153 | 8.1 czech republic | 68804 | 6.5 austria | 51282 | 5.9 norway | 30683 | 5.9 slovenia | 11417 | 5.5 eu | 2605629 | 5.1 switzerland * | 41105 | 5.0 belgium | 50085 | 4.5 netherlands | 72355 | 4.3 spain | 192931 | 4.2 finland | 21797 | 4.0 greece | 37464 | 3.5 iceland | 1144 | 3.5 france | 226630 | 3.4 latvia | 6357 | 3.2 estonia | 3984 | 3.0 italy | 178884 | 2.9 portugal | 29021 | 2.8 germany | 194813 | 2.4 hungary | 20751 | 2.1 lithuania | 5178 | 1.8 slovakia | 9279 | 1.7 bulgaria | 9595 | 1.3 croatia | 3433 | 0.8 romania | 11289 | 0.6, 
  even for 45 \u00b0 this would be true since we 're living on the geoid . 
  perhaps they do n't like _ switching _ the context like we could see here . 
  that 's definitely the case for me , english should have an unambiguous word describing independent countries only . 
  the _ do n't know _ bracket is interesting to me , what makes such differences ? 
  it 's not that easy , i ca n't imagine learning math in one long run from easiest concepts to the brink of human knowledge . 
  instead , you have to learn in layers and when you 're learning new layer you have to have solid understanding of bottom layers and how you obtain that ? 
  you have to those _ things _ to internalize newfound knowledge . 
  i do n't know what 's the optimal way of learning math , most importantly there should be good materials such as [ 3blue1brown ] ( http://www.3blue1brown.com/ ) [ ^ youtube ^ link ] ( https://www.youtube.com/channel/ucyo_jab_esufrv4b17ajtaw ) ( this material is not from the lowest layer , it 's just an example ) . 
  i 've also heard about an alternative way of learning : [ h-mat ] ( http://www.h-mat.cz/en ) . 
  i know it 's 2001 data , but if i imagine the proportional line going through us , i have to conlude we are ( were ) the worst . 
  edit : however , note you get an ill condition at small percantages .

  we are ok too , sort of we would be a bigger polluter . 
  that 's just crazy . 
  was it the case of a sabotage or was it a faithful imitation of society though ? 
  it 's more difficult to learn grammatical gender when both your mother tongue and the foreign one have them and they 're clashing . 
  german and czech have both 3 genders so it 's a mess . 
   neural networks are incredibly cool , i think we should all have access to them so they can learn . 
  i 'd love to see an nn like this get better over time . 
  hey that 's the one right in your head . 
  if i take you seriously :  i think we should ** all ** have access to them it 's not so appealing , you could sabotage the process of learning . 
  still , it does n't make a sense to me making every project with nn accessible to the wide public . 
  it 's just one of the methods of machine learning . 
  okay we 're pretty centered .

  you 're right , but the disproportion would have to be huge , beacause there are [ not many christians or believers ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/religion_in_the_czech_republic ) .

  actually , it 's not europe , it is the [ netherlands ] ( https://what-if.xkcd.com/53/ ), 
  my only comment in this thread was about exclusivity of values you listed . 
  so i fail to see where i made a contradiction . 
  the color-blinded images show colors as if the spectra of two cones are more overlapping . 
  there is dark yellowish czechoslovakia in the protanope and deuteranope images , the protanope one is darker . 
   i am very unsensitive to red colors , and every other color that should trigger the red light sensors in your eyes . 
  provided that l-cones are just unsensitive and they do n't have a too much shifted spectrum ( they can be more and more sensitive as the spectrum shifts towards m-cones ' one . 
  ) , provided that the spectra of subpixels are n't too much overlapping either * , you should see various blues and almost black ( might have a slight tint of green , because of the red subpixel spectrum ) instead of red in the tritanope image , and dark green czechoslovakia in the protanope and deuteranope images . 
  * would be a nice experiment to look at monochromatic laser lights of all sorts of wavelengths in a dimly lit room if you could trigger perception of hues you ca n't normaly see . 
  were you also group or just a couple ? 
  how many people were there ? 
  it seems to me that you ascribe their behavior incorrectly to skin color differences . 
  perhaps they wanted to have people inside at the end of shift so they could observe them easily , but when that group came in they just abandoned this decision with that they would more attend that group ( because they presumed they could make a bank ) . 
   that would be the same as being uncomfortable with them being gay no , it would n't . 
  if you philosophy about theological questions , it 's ok . 
  if you are religious , i view it as impaired * reasoning , i do n't see anything impaired about having different sexual preferences . 
  * if it 's a too harsh word select a softer one . 
  qwerty  qwertz  azerty, 
  i do n't know if [ denormal numbers ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/denormal_number ) would suffice . 
   if we recognise that these prejudices are heuristics , and that these heuristics do not line up with real life , then it only makes sense to tackle them . 
  yes i agree . 
  actually , when i thought about prejudices in general , they looked fairly similar to optimizations/heuristics in algorithms . 
  while prejudices are a bad thing , heuristics are a good thing . 
  why is that ? 
  because you do n't want to discriminate people , but still it seems weird that prejudices should be 100 % bad , because when they are built upon anecdotes , they serve a similar purpose as heuristics : save the time and analyzing power . 
  ( if it 's based on one 's own anecdotes , it 's not even strange to use it -- that 's how i see it ) -- this was really briefly written , i think if it was elaborated , you could somehow make a point from it when someone would post `` prejudices are bad '' into / r/cmv . 
  yes we are , look at the map and the abundant comfortable feeling around jews . 
  never heard these values must be exclusively christian . 
  a very comprehensive map album , the unfairness map seem like a nice touch , i thought i knew it , but after a second look i 'm not so sure how it 's calculated . 
  it 's kazakhstan : * [ west kazakhstan ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/west_kazakhstan_region ) * [ atyrau ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/atyrau_region ), 
  this is [ closer ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3djmtw/how_redditors_divided_up_europe_crosspost/ ) to my view . 
  i 'd say it 's in a heavy category , because it is _ this is how i view europe as a ... _ that easily starts a wave of submissions . 
  that 's what [ a fan ] ( https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/453290183639584768/ao79jqsx.jpeg ) would do on the internet . 
  well , i 'm not acquainted enough about barnevernet and the cases if it was objectively positive or negative thing , but some years ago i saw this [ miniseries ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hjernevask ) and what did i took from it is that norwegians are able to go over the top so to speak .

  i am saying that turkey is the last country on the planet that should be accusing others of ethnic cleansing and genocide . 
  clean up your dirty history first . 
  poland and a couple of other countries were outvoted in this matter , which was unprecedented ( in both scope and stupidity ) . 
  you do n't outvote eu countries on matters they consider to be at the core of a nation 's sovereignty , like immigration policy ; in these things , the eu had traditionally sought consensus . 
  the quotas are , for all intents an purposes , unenforceable , stupid and -- worst of all -- dysfunctional as 90 + percent of eu countries are failing to meet them ( very intentionally ) . 
  now the eu has singled out the `` easterners '' because they make a convenient target for being the most vocal about it and people in old eu countries still have latent prejudices against them . 
  in any case , the quota system will collapse and the eu will have to adopt a more sensible policy ( do n't let people into europe ; process asylum seekers in eu facilities established in libya and other source countries ) . 
  what goes around , comes around . 
  any accusations of foul play come off as especially hypocritical if raised by a nation that is still denying having perpetrated one of the largest genocides of the 20th century . 
  turkey is like russia : constantly bullying and trying to conquer everyone around itself , and then wondering why people hate it . 
  well , yes and no . 
  the crusades happened in the middle ages . 
  turkish attempts to conquer and enslave central europe happened in the early modern era and lasted almost to the 18th century . 
  that 's much more recent history . 
  while the czechs , austrians and slovaks have mostly forgotten this ( but there are interesting sayings in our languages , referencing turkey and turks as the bogeyman ) , the history is much more alive in the balkans ( adding to the myriads of that region 's troubles ) . 
  and people wonder why central europeans do n't want thousands upon thousands of middle eastern `` asylum-seekers '' at large in their countries . 
  fortunately , they do n't want to go here ( apparently , the welfare benefits provided do n't allow them to live as comfortably as they 'd like ) yet . 
  that is true , we have a truly abysmal record as concerns small , mostly liberal parties trying to become established . 
  but that is no reason to actively hinder them . 
  what this results in are vv or ano , i.e. 
  marketing-based political projects designed to `` leapfrog '' the 5 % threshold by heavy promotion backed by lots of money . 
  vv imploded after a few years , but ano is here to stay , or so it seems , and i would n't call that a good thing . 
  one step we should implement immediately is to remove that ridiculous clause that electoral coalitions have higher thresholds for getting seats ( i.e. 
  kdu-\u010csl 's electoral coalition with the other minor party needs 10 % instead of 5 % ) . 
  this is genuinely destructive as instead of consolidation , it favours fragmentation . 
  smaller parties wo n't risk failure by allying with ideologically similar , but small parties . 
  as a result , the electorate 's votes are being split needlessly . 
  it prevents smaller parties from getting in , proving their mettle , and growing . 
  which only serves the interests of the establishment . 
  his brother is a devout catholic and totally disapproves of his policies . 
  the irony here is that he 's trying to make czech society less open and welcoming , yet it was this openness that allowed him to become famous and enter politics . 
  sure , right now he 's ranting about islam , but the far-right agenda does n't stop there . 
  before you know it , they 'll be calling for czexit from the eu and nato and lick putin 's boots . 
  honestly , these people will be truer europeans than most of us ever were . 
  exactly , it is a giant pyramid scheme . 
  it needs to be abandoned and reformed . 
  people should be encouraged and enabled to save money for retirement , instead of being led to rely on the state to provide pensions . 
  the latter is increasingly unsustainable as it would entail taxing young people to death ( in turn making it impossible for them to start their own families , thus further reducing birth rates ) . 
  so , taking this to the logical conclusion : * we need more and more young people to support more and more old people * . 
  you do realize that infinite population growth is impossible , right ? 
  if anything , europe is already pretty overpopulated . 
  we should simply accept the fact of demographic decline and adapt to it , while pursuing technologies to prolong productive human lifespans ( eventually , this will enable couples to have the two children necessary to sustain steady-state demographics ) . 
   why are we treating population like it 's a ponzi scheme ? 
  with automation , we need less unskilled migrants not more . 
  there will be too many unskilled and uneducated people competing for too many jobs . 
  it suits the corporations to feed this false notion that `` ageing societies '' automatically mean chaos and collapse , ergo we need to `` import '' people ... ( who will of course work for less money , eh eh eh , you did n't hear that last bit ) . 
  in reality , we need to simply adapt . 
  it is possible that the productive human lifespan will in the future be prolonged through advanced medicine , so it will be normal for people to have children in their 50s , for instance . 
  that would very likely lead to a rebound in birth rates as women would be able to both pursue their careers and still have children . 
  nothing is set in stone . 
  given that populations ( all human populations ) do n't like large-scale immigration ( since at some point , it starts looking like an invasion of foreign peoples and cultures ) , our best bet to maintaining healthy , democratic and stable societies is to start thinking about ways how to adapt to demographic decline while waiting for technology to address the `` problem '' . 
  this notion that `` productivity is so much lower in new eu member states '' ** needs to die in a fire ** . 
  it is completely ridiculous to suggest that a czech car factory worker is three times less efficient than a german one ; in reality , they 're about the same , while the difference is pure statistics ( i 'll get back to it later ) . 
  at the same time , the czech worker will earn two or three times less than the same-position german worker . 
  how is that fair ? 
  where is the non-discrimination ethos of `` equal money for equal work '' ? 
  this `` low productivity '' is a result of the new eu member states being what i call a * `` sub-contractor economy '' * . 
  we produce stuff that the germans re-package and sell with huge margins ; these margins and most of the profits stay in germany ( and other older eu countries from where the investors came ) , which then reports amazing productivity ( really , germany profited hugely from the eu enlargement ) . 
  this is a result of the 1990s massive privatisation in the czech republic , slovakia , poland and elsewhere in the former eastern bloc , which ended up with foreign companies owning large parts of many industrial sectors in the new eu countries . 
  as a consequence , * profits flow out of these countries * into the hand of foreign-based owners of the parent conglomerates . 
  the bad thing is there is nothing much that can be done about this . 
  we ca n't simply `` nationalise '' thousands of czech branches of foreign companies , that would be illegal and ruinous . 
  what we should do is ( a ) keep pressing foreign companies to increase wages ( by means of minimum wage and public pressure ) ; ( b ) grow new native companies in emerging industrial sectors ( hi-tech ) ; ( c ) efficiently utilise eu subsidies to promote native entrepreneurs rather than trans-national businesses ; ( d ) lead the eu in e-government and ease of doing business ( thumbs up to estonia , boo to the rest ) . 
  indeed . 
  these conventions were designed for a different world ; nobody counted with millions of people moving around and claiming asylum on often false premises . 
  back then , it was mosty about people fleeing from totalitarian regimes in the eastern bloc . 
  extraterritorial asylum processing centres in africa . 
  all rescued and detained migrants are sent there until their asylum applications are resolved . 
  that would put a stop to this farce , and it would be perfectly legal . 
  yes . 
  occupy a part of libya , build reception centres there and negotiate lease later . 
  if the libyans are incapable of controlling their borders , we can do it for them . 
  for christ sake . 
  i do n't dislike rosling , i respected him ; however , his presentations were doing harm by spreading false optimism about the global demographic situation -- a notion that we just need to keep business as usual and the population will peak , piece of cake . 
  if regions such as africa collapse in the second half of the 21st century due to environmental degradation and resource depletion , descending into a huge `` failed state '' mess with hundreds of millions of people dying and another hundreds of millions trying to get out , it will be the fault of people who failed to raise sufficient alarm when the african situation was still fixable ( say , 1980s , 1990s at the latest ) . 
  we 're now in the `` damage control '' territory . 
  yes , 1.5 billion was ill-advised , i take it back ( it 's insane how much the african population grew since i last checked ) . 
  nevertheless , the u.n. projections of 4.5 billion by 2100 are absolutely alarming . 
  people should be ringing bells and devising radical birth control policies , not shouting at macron for pointing out the reality of the situation . 
  [ u.n. 
  projections ] ( https://esa.un.org/unpd/wpp/graphs/probabilistic/pop/tot/ ) continent-wide one child policy would probably be best , but is sadly impossible to enforce without a functional ( and repressive ) government . 
  india will probably be another major disaster area , but environmentally it is still less fragile than many parts of subsaharan africa ( especially the arid areas ) . 
  however , in india there is at least a reasonably competent government . 
  this is n't the case in most african countries . 
  first of all , if anyone points me to another hans rosling video , i swear i am going to kill someone . 
  he was an extreme optimist who , as i said , always operated on the false notion that `` there is plenty of resources to fuel further growth of consumption '' . 
  that is not true . 
  human resource consumption levels must decrease significantly or we 're screwed good , globally . 
  the problem here is that developed countries have the technology , infrastructure and , increasingly , the will to enact sweeping changes in order to ensure sustainable future . 
  developing countries are usually totally uninterested in environmental standards and other western `` nonsense '' ; they need to feed , clothe and take care of ever increasing masses of people , so even their gdp growth has trouble keeping up with the population growth . 
  subsistence farmers do n't care about `` maintaining biodiversity '' or `` protecting endangered species '' ; they care about feeding their 8 children so they 'll slash and burn rainforests and never look back . 
  therefore , the first order of business must be to bring down birth rates , to reduce this destructive demographic pressure in the developing countries and allowing them to focus , ** with the help of developed countries ** , on lifting themselves out of poverty and doing so sustainably , without repeating the worst mistakes of the european or chinese industrialisation story . 
  i am not saying 11-fold increase is great and survivable ; i am saying it is approximately 45 % less bad than a 20-fold increase would be . 
  as i noted above , the demographic explosion is making all our other problems worse .

  some with germans , some with turks , some with nordics , some with sheep . 
  we all have our parts in our comedy . 
  one writes the script , the other plays the part . 
  dude , western europe is like a big amish paradise compared to our `` religiousness '' . 
  makes sense . 
  they do n't care about russia that much because they are outside russia 's `` interest '' zone and russian threats do n't affect them on a personal level , while the unpredictability and heavy-handed approach of us is easy to comprehend and worry about . 
  no portugal , then . 
  one badly planned transition to universal basic income and all cards will be reshuffled again . 
  everything is everybody 's and no one owns anything . 
  yay for social experiments . 
  we do trade with them , just less than before as many of our exports are being blocked . 
  a potential large scale military conflict in eastern europe would cost us far more than any loss from restricted trade . 
  an aggressor must not be encouraged , we 've paid a terrible price for that lesson . 
  about authoritarian vs fascist -  going over the definition of fascism , every aspect matches the modern russia so close that it leaves no room for doubt . 
  eastern europe shielded west from a very long list of nasty invading cultures . 
  but at least you 've put that safety to a good use < 3, 
  we 'd love to trade with russia . 
  a normal , cultured , and peaceful russia that does n't look at their neighbours as lambs to be eaten , or toys to be bullied and broken . 
  sadly , the great and culturally rich russia prefers to be a fascist state instead . 
  dropping the sanctions , ineffective as they might be , would be still seen and used as a huge victory for russia and encouragement of its recent activities . 
  that would be worse than the current state . 
  much worse . 
  yeah , as close as we are to each other now , we share very little common history before the formation of czechoslovakia . 
  the winds of history always dragged us in different , separate directions . 
  mra is the same . 
  people ranging from sensible humans with true equality in mind to utter lunatics . 
  both movements suffer terribly from their black sheeps and the circle-jerks they successfully maintain in the discourse . 
  mmhm , sure , whatever . 
  you mean why was n't ussr sanctioned for redrawing internal borders between two regions of their country ? 
  because that act alone is n't illegal . 
  garlic sauce , the only sauce . 
  perhaps the impression was caused by the movement 's inability to keep their more unhinged elements on leash . 
  it 's been decades since feminism was considered a positive word . 
  too many spoiled apples in that basket . 
   belgium that 's a really funny way to spell czechia, 
  cool story , bro . 
  japanese is really easy for czechs , a few traps here and there and a different stress/tempo , everything else sounds just like a czech would read it natively . 
  somebody has the chronic case of the mondays, 
  there 's quality and there 's paying extra for nothing . 
  that 's like claiming raisins are better than grapes . 
  jam\u00f3n is awesome , but i would n't use it in place of our delicious juicy ham . 
  yes , it 's there . 
  we just do n't recognise it or write it in any way . 
  here , some spaghetti with ketchup and grated edam to make you forget that . 
  depending on your definition of serious . 
  \u010cssd usually plays that role and considers itself a left wing party . 
  they are pretty tame , though , paying only lip service to some more progressive concepts . 
  no , nothing that could be called a reform . 
  they have n't changed to keep their fossilised voter base . 
  visiting their rallies is like being thrown 50 years back . 
  same words , same ideals , same hatred . 
  just the numbers are smaller and they do n't have the power to carry out their threats . 
  40 years of terror , hundreds of thousands of victims and they have never even apologised , still clinging to the belief that they were right and utterly justified in everything they did . 
  we have n't banned them , but it 's so , so , so very tempting . 
  brainwashed , stupid or malicious . 
  or any combination of those . 
  you get an opportunity to talk with one of them , and all you will be able to sense is a hatred , resentment and longing for the old times , when the working class was privileged , feared and in charge of everything . 
  depends on what flavour of apocalyptic cult you are subscribed to . 
  mine comes with a free kaiser roll . 
  it did a lot more for many of these minorities than what is being generally attributed for . 
  the current `` reputation '' of a-h is similar to what the future view on eu would be like if it would be destroyed , dissolved and the history written by eu hating idiots just like klaus . 
  edit : i am talking about the austrian part . 
  hungarians were completely hopeless pricks . 
  basic problems = same as current eu . 
  bunch of whiny populists , opportunists and nationalists trying to tear apart a neutral centralised hierarchy , so they could all be their own little kings . 
  the current state of eu is so similar to the last decades of the empire it terrifies me . 
  ha ha ha . 
  it 's been a long time since i 've played the game ( after they introduced ranked 8vs8 , i think ) but i always loved your videos . 
  tomorrow j/k, 
  with or without people inside ? 
  yes , but wait for a 1 or 2 more generations to be replaced before we start pushing it more seriously , we need a bigger part of the population that will grew up in a cosmopolitan world of peaceful united europe . 
  the current population would rip the europe to pieces . 
  more like 30-40 % over here for the cheapest set s ( ~ 100-130 euro ), 
  no need for any solution when you realize it 's been happening since the dawn of time . 
  poor , stupid and underprivileged always had more children . 
  it 's not really a big issue . 
  human societies handle that on daily basis without even paying attention to it . 
  hello , my name is james holden ... * ( but only people watching/reading the expanse will get it ... ) *, 
  i really like your example and explanation . 
  oh no , do n't get me wrong , i supported the settlement . 
  there were some slightly questionable parts with respect to inflation or property confiscated before communists took over , but eh , whatever . 
  the general perception of the deal was negative , though . 
  people saw the half-forgotten relic of the past appearing out of nowhere and asking for insane amount of money , land and properties . 
  that did n't help its historically ingrained image of greedy monks . 
  smart decision, 
   hussite i prefer [ this ] ( http://uncyclopedia.wikia.com/wiki/hussite_wars ) personally , 
  the stereotype is pretty widespread , strongly reinforced by the few years old deal between czech state and catholic church about returning the church properties confiscated during 20th century . 
  there are good priests , but they are seen as exceptions proving the rule . 
  brits are pretty weird people, 
  one was a move to preserve control over a vital strategic military installation in otherwise peaceful area under a guise of an imminent threat to russian minority . 
  there was no real threat of ethnic violence , the only threat was that of sevastopol slowly falling into western sphere of influence . 
  the other was a forced separation of two ethnic groups that have spent at least a decade trying to murderfuck each other to oblivion at rate eventually reaching levels unseen in europe since ww2 . 
  not even remotely comparable . 
  if it acts like a duck ... russia is a textbook example of a fascist state for more than a decade now . 
  losing some money is better than encouraging aggression of fascist states . 
  it certainly helps to repeat these flaws again and again , until the noise drowns out the positives . 
  they did a pretty terrific job by `` finding some dots on a map '' . 
  our legionnaires did n't ask to be caught in the middle of this godforsaken war , but they did an amazing job with resources at hand , holding the trans-siberian railroad and the surrounding areas free of commies for more than a year , while slowly fighting their way to the east to vladivostok , from where they traveled across the pacific , usa , atlantic until they arrived in our newly independent country 2 years after the end of ww1 ... their story reads like a modern odyssey . 
  my great grand-father was one of them , sadly i never had the chance to talk to him . 
  here 's one fort known more for holding people in than out ...

  no other religion became so synonymous with progress as christianity . 
  were it not for christianity 's ideological basis , there would be no democracy , there was no force in the whole world which would have brought us democracy or that even was on a trajectory to democracy . 
  democracy is christianity 's brainchild . 
  i mean sure , ancient greece had a democracy for a while , but christianity was built on greek and roman philosophical thought . 
  i 'm saying its not like christianity was completely repressive and backwards religion . 
  the dark middle ages is mostly a myth . 
  the church was just an instrument of oppression used by worldly rulers , on its own it was the only organisation interested in knowledge , philosophy , art , thanks to medieval monks we can read aristotle . 
  islam is different . 
  islam never underwent such reformation ( even though they were close before the golden horde came ) , in islam is the state , the church and god are all one and quran 's author is allah . 
  the culture is just completely different , and yes , it needs to be updated if it wants to deal with the west in any way . 
  until then , we should support this reformation and stop taking any people from this culture , as its completely incompatible with the whole tradition of western thought . 
  everybody is talking about moderate muslim , sure , they are not blowing themselves up , but these moderate muslim have opinions that would be considered barbaric in any european country hundreds of years ago . 
  and we have to hold islamic culture accountable for the fact that it has failed to keep up . 
  the world has changed due to globalisation etc , its not the middle ages anymore , interaction between cultures is much more fluid and fast . 
  instead , islam turns into itself and becomes more extreme . 
  this is not a single rare incident . 
  islam has been the most problematic religion/culture in history , you just ca n't act like christianity went through this phase too and that its ok . times have changed , the circumstances were different then . 
  its not ok . cultures are not equal - that would be like saying that raping underages is just as good as our western notions of universal humans rights , which is obviously bollocks . 
  if you believe in any way in libert\u00e9 , egalit\u00e9 and fraternit\u00e9 , you have to hold them accountable . 
  otherwise you are just intellectually dishonest , and probably have a very malevolent agenda . 
  we do n't need to be racists , islamophobic , xenophobic . 
  we do n't need to make any value judgements at all . 
  we can just calmly , rationally , without any needless emotions , state the clear fact : ** islam and muslims are just not compatible with the western civilisation . 
  ** you say islam is not the problem , that only the criminals and the regressive authoritarian states , that proclaim they represent islam , are the problem . 
  i am saying you ca n't divide islam the religion from islam the culture and islam the state . 
  in all of their history , they have n't done this division either . 
  islam is such a regressive , underdeveloped , degenerate religion/ideology that it never managed to organise itself in such a way as for it to be even possible to not be held accountable for this . 
  it never underwent a reformation , it never represented progressive ideas . 
  there is no recent islamic philosophical tradition of democracy , freedom , equality . 
  the only countries where islam behaves relatively good , the only muslim countries that are developed , are the secular , somewhat westernised countries . 
  for all practical purposes sa , is , they * are * islam . 
  because it 's already happening , especially in the middle east . 
  that 's the epicenter right now , the frontier of cultures , the borderlands . 
  there will be more in time if nothing changes . 
  also , who knows if the final product of the globalisation is even desirable . 
  maybe it will turn out to be worse . 
  this situation is completely unprecedented , we 're stepping into completely unknown waters , but everybody is acting like this is the best thing ever already . 
  the migrant crisis is just the first major tumble in this journey that we could feel domestically , and we 're having huge trouble with it already . 
  as you said , its probably gon na happen , but its going to be very violent , a lot of people will die in the process , and the world will lose a lot of its diversity and culture . 
  i 'm just saying `` be careful what you wish for . '', 
  islam as in culture and ideology , not only religion . 
  as a whole package , islam is completely incompatible with european cultures . 
  and saying that islam is n't problem , granted that most muslim , including those in west , are in favor of oppressing women , hate gays and democracy and such , that 's just dishonest , do n't you think ? 
  christianity underwent a lot of reformations to move on from the bad stuff in the bible over the centuries , no such thing happened in islam . 
  cheaper plane tickets and international trade ca n't override human nature . 
  people are n't tabula rasa , you know . 
  just as technological and scientifical progress has been masking societal decay , globalisation is masking the divide between cultures up until the internal pressure is too high . 
  just look at islam . 
  every sensible politician has already said that multiculturalism is a failure . 
  even merkel , if her words have any value at all today . 
  different cultures either mix , even out , merge , both losing some of its identity in process like mixing two colors , or they do n't mix at all and the pressure rises . 
  if one wishes to celebrate diversity of human culture , its better for all cultures to stay mostly separate . 
  nearly every culture is welcoming ... until a certain point . 
  homogenous societies are the normal . 
  every person cares for his own kind first . 
  there is such thing as a priority list in every person 's subconscious , and it usually goes like this : family , friends , acquaintances , ... , town , region , country , maybe continent . 
  its completely natural to feel stronger sympathy to your mother then someone 's else mother . 
  that 's how civilisations rose in the first place , people who had common values , ideas , traditions and helped themselves and created something bigger than them , in the process becoming even more homogenous , creating and strengthening their identity . 
  tourists and occasional immigrants do n't threaten that at all . 
  migration crisis like this certainly does . 
  this is n't something new and groundbreaking , a lot has been written about this , what 's astounding is the fact that people have forgotten this . 
  i think some amount of patriotism and nationalism is healthy . 
  so i 'd say reasonably patriotic . 
  well from what i 've heard afd * does * have good chance to get seats . 
  how could you * see * that argument ? 
  not allow a party to join an election debate because their views are too different from the other parties ? 
  how is that even justifiable ? 
  the moderator/host should concern himself with derailing , not the people who send invites . 
  those should only assure that as many parties as possible get an opportunity to be heard . 
  we in czech republic are too guilty of not inviting/ignoring some smaller non-parliamentary parties as far as big debates go , but its not because of blackmailing of other parties and we have a programme that is specifically focused on small parties called political spectrum that allows even the monarchists to be visible . 
  still not enough , but that 's something at least . 
  i called you out when you were clearly wrong , this is not the same . 
  you are the one who started the insults with tongue in cheek comments about our farmers , factory workers and politicians . 
  if anything its naive you and the germans and others trust the future and feasibility of wind and solar so much , as they are expensive , ineffective , unreliable , inefficient and overall more dangerous both to human lives and the environment , both during servicing and during manufacturing . 
  you just want to feel good and green and progressive but in the long run you will see how mistaken you were . 
  the facts are here today already , actually they were here since this whole green energy fashion started , but it will take time before your public puts off their green blindfolds to acknowledge them . 
  i can provide the statistics , as i study electrical engineering myself , but i doubt you 'd take them on . 
  let 's try , though . 
  for example : did you know that for every single terawatthour produced by solar plants 0,44 people die due to injuries or illnesses connected to the service/production , but only 0,04 people died for each twh made by nuclear plants due to effects connected to them , including chernobyl , fukushima , three mile island and every single disaster there was ? 
  ( for comparison , deaths due to wind turbines are 0,15 / twh , so still worse than nuclear , and thats not counting the tens of thousands of bird deaths annually ) or did you know that in order to have a 1 000 mw solar plant you need 130 kilometres squared of land ( that could 've been used for fields or just about anything , really , so that is an additional cost ) , and its construction and function is going to produce 80-220 grams of co2 per each kilowatthour produced , while for a 1 000 mw nuclear plant you need only 10 kilometres squared , and its construction and function are going to produce only 5-35 grams of carbon dioxide per kwh produced ? 
   unfortunately you do n't realise that propaganda is not making your stuff any safer . 
  i would have argued that the only propaganda there is is the one in favor of the so called green renewable energy , as the safety of modern nuclear power plants does n't have to be justified by propaganda but by technical and physical description of its inner workings and features ; but i wo n't do that because ...  good for you , dear neighbour . 
  you also do have the best farmers , factory workers and politicians . 
  a paradise . 
  ... you 've clearly shown you are not here for an intelligent , level-headed discussion , which is sad , because you 've shown that you are not a dumbass - thus far . 
  that is why i am appalled by you posting these three sentences , which clearly is an idiotic decision . 
  so either you truly are a dumbass , which would n't be surprising given your lack of knowledge on the matter , or you mock me and the whole point of the discussion we were having , which may not make you a dumbass automatically , but makes further discussion pointless . 
  this is basically the whole czech-austrian energy quarrel in a nutshell . 
  yours and german energy and electrical/physical engineering experts know that nuclear is good ( just as the ones from the rest of the world ) , but your public and thus politicians is nearly religiously convinced of the truth being the opposite . 
  no technology , no progress , no hard evidence can change your mind because you 've chosen your position on an emotional basis , the same irrational basis with which you attack our energy sources regularly , while happily using them . 
  the discussion is thus pointless and resorts to simple jaded and bitter attacks , just as the one you 've used on me . 
  either way , i like you , austrians . 
  just stop caring about our plants and call us when you need us to buy power from your expensive windturbines , please . 
  always happy to buy stuff that is mostly paid for by citizens of other countries . 
  we do n't have much problems with peak currents . 
  our hydroelectric plants are capable of providing for our storing needs , i 've been to a few myself . 
  our electric power network is one of the stablest and best designed ones in whole europe thanks to ee professors such as vladimir list ; after all germans prefer to send their energy to some parts of their country through our territory when possible because our grid can deal better with overvoltages . 
  we are dominantly exporting nuclear energy and only buy when austrians , germans or danish need to get rid of their wind energy so desperately they make it hilariously cheap ( hilariously because the huge costs of funding and clean energy donations for the wind and solar stuff pay their tax payers , not ours  ) . 
  when the wind is not blowing there we can then sell them ours energy , which we have an abundance of , for a significant profit . 
  that 's true i suppose .

  syrio forel dead and meryn trant 's not 'cause trant had armor and a big fucking sword .

  thats us , your brothers .

  how can this guy still be voice of uk ? 
  thanks !, 
  we should unite with slovakia and call it kingdom of bohemia ... aaaah ohhh yes, 
  i would like to see this map few decades ago . 
  numbers around 80 % would not surprise me . 
  we can annex saxony if you do n't want them . 
  i agree , the problem is quite opposite . 
  population of earth growing like on steroids thanks to asia and more importantly africa . 
  right now african population is young and economy is growing . 
  but can you imagine what will happen in few decades ? 
  i think africa will have huge problems with old population and you can expect massive immigration into europe . 
  yes it is bad manner . 
  at least here . 
  most arrogant not france for us ? 
  rigged, 
  eu average 42.6 ... 
  us is almost 5 years younger , relatively big difference, 
  europe population is growing thanks to migration, 
  [ we member too ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/german_occupation_of_czechoslovakia ), 
  this subreddit - total disaster !, 
  bad !, 
  next day : we have invaded parts of latvia and estronia . 
  guess what ? all the russian population there is happy !, 
  shortly after that , you will learn from your media , that current latvian and estonian regime was corrupt and our reunion is good for everyone . 
  ireland is 35-40 , unless i am not blind . 
  turkey is mostly below 35, 
  why exactly you wan na have more people in the continent ? 
  planet is overpopulated already and europe is still growing on population ( thanks to the migration mostly ) . 
  there has to be some limit and i dont wan na live in 1 big dirty city . 
  so here 's the committee that will evaluate each single person what are the chances of conception ? 
  so if you are ugly for whatever reason , or you cant have kids , you will be taxed ? 
  there is also not exactly 50 % mens and 50 % womans . 
  and if no one will want to have baby with you , will you just rape someone to avoid taxes ? 
  who i am , if i was born in 92 ? 
  too old for millennials and too young for generation x. 
  it is , we have a lot of problems to solve in that time . 
  i agree , i think nobody new will join eu in next 10 years . 
  younger ? 
  we ( czechs ) are older than france , uk , belgium , norway , ireland , iceland , sweden ... etc. 
  hugary or estonia is almost the same as us . 
  you see only that big contrast when you compare us to germany , but we are not that young overall . 
  this is a big surprise , when all these data are provided by the eu . 
  [ source  ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/products-eurostat-news/-/ddn-20170215-1?inheritredirect=true&amp;redirect=%2feurostat%2f ) across the 1342 nuts 3 regions of the european union ( eu ) , the median age , which divides a population into two equally sized groups , was in 2016 lowest in the french overseas department of mayotte ( 17.8 years ) and highest in the greek region of evrytania ( 53.6 years ) . 
  oldest regions in germany , youngest in the united kingdom overall , 63 eu regions at nuts 3 level recorded a median age of 50 years or over . 
  46 of those regions were in germany . 
  at the opposite end of the scale , 24 eu regions had a median age of 35 years or less , of which 18 were in the united kingdom . 
  for the entire eu , the median age of the population stands at 42.6 years . 
  looking at the typology of regions , it appears that predominantly urban regions have a younger population ( with a median age of 41.5 years ) overall and that the rural regions have an older population ( 43.7 years ) . 
  croatia is between france , sweden and netherlands , 
  yes , i make money for them even with adblock . 
  not directly , but i am still unique ip adress visitor of that website . 
  more visited website or article = more popular = bigger chance to bring someone who actualy click on banners . 
  you doesnt have to go retard mode to make profit as journalist . 
  this is simply full greed . 
  this `` please turn off adblock , so we can do our job '' is realy just a clickbait in different form in most websites . 
  internet is growing , people wan na work on the internet/it more and more . 
  and yes , even journalism is groving on the internet and you can choose what you will actualy follow . 
  and if someone goes full greed and clearly care more about money , that actual journalism i have no reason to keep my adblock off and i leave that website . 
  i simpy stop visiting websites which have this agresive `` turn off adblock , so we can make more money '' policy . 
  its not even a city . 
  it 's a football club `` brussel dortmund '' or something like that . 
  not only happy . 
  i remember maps of suecides rates in europe . 
  south europe always lowest and greece paradoxically the lowest in whole europe . 
  then you do n't quite understand how complex economy works . 
  what will i do with all that money ? 
  europe , can we stop being so good ? 
  and prague is in the ... danville ? 
  how fitting :(, 
  this is too long even for me . 
  if someone wan na make some short version it would be great . 
  france , netherlands , belgium , ireland neighbors . 
  czechs replacing uk confirmed . 
  but if eu economy is larger , some country should miss from this map instead . 
  on this map is whole eu + ukraine , norway , marocco , switzerland , serbia , bosnia , moldova ... . etc i dont realy wan na calculate it , but sources of those gdp informations are suspisious . 
  [ czechs have saab jas 39 gripen from sweden for example ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/saab_jas_39_gripen ), 
   i am going to london , amsterdam and france ( vimy ridge ) . 
  anything special i should take yes , take a lot of money . 
  these are expensive destinations for most of the world . 
   those and several other initiatives with norway , romania and the czech republic are part of a broader drive to expand european defense cooperation to be announced at a meeting of nato defense ministers in brussels , the sources said . 
   the agreements come as germany and other nato members face increasing pressure from the united states to spend more for their own military and reach nato 's target of devoting 2 percent of gross domestic product to defense spending . 
  right choice, 
  so do you think it 's wise to ban it ? 
  do you think , that it has any noticeable negative effect on children 's ? 
  it 's bad to show kids , how the world really looks like and do n't play theatre on them . 
  ( not sure if this is any common phrase in english , basicaly show them ordinary reality ) i 'm not saying what is good or bad , just asking for opinion . 
  we have quite different problem , than most of the europe , this super-low unemployment actually slowing our economy . 
  to be honest , we are catching italy so fast , only because they are stagnant for many years now . 
  to have same level as germany for example , is task for at least 100 years at this rate .

  so its fine to set example for others , that females should wear scarf ? 
  thats is why i include dots '' ... '' behind it , in my language it means continuation . 
  and again i talk about religion all the time , and you shifting blame to the people all the time . 
  i respect people . 
  i do not respect religion which force people to wear something only based on what they have between legs . 
  and do you respect people when you are wearing a burka/hijab ... ?

you must be blast at parties,

  yes !, 
  i want central europe part !,

  to be fair the mechanics in this joke could be either french or british . 
  but yeah , come think of it the french mechanics must be quite brilliant given that they get soo much practice repairing broken french cars .

  i was thinking the same . 
  they are strict but fair . 
  i would be more afraid of french gendarmes , seen them strip-search a guy on a highway in the middle of a rainy night . 
  cheers !, 
  ( we 're not there either ), 
  you know i am very unsure of historical protection of habitats . 
  the way i 'm seeing it is that those houses were build in their own age to serve a purpose . 
  not as a historical monument or piece of art . 
  but as a place to live safely and thanks to our social and scientific progress we can safely assume that this purpose they failed due obsolence . 
  yes , they may look cozy and cute but they are no place to live . 
  as well as colosseum is no place to play football nowdays . 
  they can be kept , and taken care of as a part of cultural heritage , but they should n't be lived in . 
  `` the czech representative was in strassbourg altogether .

  we celebrate two - 1.1 . is anniversary of formation of independent czech state in 1993 , but everyone is too hungover to celebrate anything . 
  28.10 . is czechoslovak independence day . 
  we hang flags at schools and there are lot of nostalgic tv broadcasts . 
  everyone drinks . 
  there is also day of czech statehood , 28.9 . which date back to 935 to commemorate the fratricide of duke st. wenceslaus i who is considered a patron of bohemian independence . 
  i think that especially zara has a very little step between sizes , i found that their sml chart covers range xs - m at other confections , but it may be some importing weirdness . 
  i was pretty bummed by this because they have some really nice looking blazers and pants . 
  i am 1.88 btw . 
  those brands sell mostly to teens . 
  but yes , european sizing is a mess ; we got some clothes in us sizing , some uk , and some numbered , with approximation to sml system . 
  i am 188cm man and cant fit anything xxl from zara over my shoulders . 
  it 's ridiculous . 
  the sizing of their mens collection is ridiculous . 
  i fit efortlessly into h&m l size clothing but some xxl zara stuff is too small for me . 
  in lot of slavic languages it means ( persons that are ) `` ours '' , `` us '' or `` our own '' .

  prague is mostly pictured from [ this angle ] ( http://traverseearth.smugmug.com/travel/all/i-6cllns7/0/xl/prague-skyline2-xl.jpg ) . 
  they are not typical trams but the cars are actually pulled by a cable http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cable_car_ ( railway ), 
  those are \u0160kodas too http://i.imgur.com/pjy0cdq.jpg, 
  they even build them themselves : http://www.solarisbus.com/, 
  those buses are karosas . 
  slightly less noisy than ikaruses . 
  slightly . 
  also , czechoslovakia stronk !, 
  no need dirty magyar bus !, 
  not exactly , but ours are [ somehow cool ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tg26k6yh0kw ) too !, 
  okay , thanks !, 
  i always wondered - do skateboarders and rollerbladers ride on sidewalks or bike paths ? 
  * a bad pint * i have a little epiphany here right now . 
  this could be answer to everything . 
  ** everything !, 
  well that 's quite decent , but i think that state funerals would get pretty weird with this . 
  my personal favourite however is that one : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odbxffq9em0&amp;t=77, 
  ours is quite fine , i guess . 
  it has mild lyrics , nice escalation and no warmongering and stuff . 
  people like it . 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0yavuze_dq , also this interpretation is smply awesome : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_xjowgi5erc but the best overal anthem imo is ode to joy , there is just something right in there . 
  where do you live ? 
  we pay about $ 2.5 / m ^ 3 in ostrava , of wich $ 1.2 / m ^ 3 is the price for water , the rest is price for sewage . 
  also most of the water sources are still state owned and municipalities or regions are major shareholders in their water distribution systems . 
  edit : about quality - it differs by region but generally is very good and it 's always drinkable . 
  although water in brno tasted kind of funky . 
  just ... do n't send cavalry this time , okay ? 
  naah , just kidding , you guys can kick some major ass !, 
  maybe not * that * great but definitely ** awesome **, 
  that 's oversimplifying . 
  there are economical and social ties in every dividing aspect of human population , be it ties between neighburhoods , villages , cities , regions , countries , federations , etc. 
  for example most cities co-finance their universities , as do regions , as od states and the eu . 
  same goes for infrastructure . 
  and moving of educated and productive class can be a serious problem in any of those levels since it supports unequal growth . 
  so the problem is not that much different . 
  yeah , i must have been drunk yesterday . 
  it has a bad historical context and a vast majority of people here would be very butthurt about it .

  i do n't think that there is anything more suitable than yakety sax . 
  it 's even funnier with context - it was hanged on a square where local communist cell celebrated may day - the speaker 's podium was according to press just right under it ; most of those old senilites love everything russian and this thing really stepped on their toes . 
  they even called the cops because it disturbed their peaceful gathering .

  where do you see it ? 
  what are you talking about ? 
  write a better one then . 
  i have n't noticed any big theme , it seems that most parties stick with their long term programs . 
  \u010cssd - social democrats , center left , one of the largest parties . 
  ods - civic democrats , center right , the other ( until now ) big party ks\u010cm - communist party ( actually just a conservative left wing party ) ano - a new party run by a billionare babi\u0161 , they promise to fight corruption . 
  top 09 - a right wing party lead by a duke known for falling asleep and being hard to understand . 
  \u00dasvit - another new party , lead by an eccentric bussinessman tomio okamura , mostly supporting direct democracy . 
  kdu-\u010csl - christian democrats , i do n't really know much about them . 
  pir\u00e1ti - pirate party sz/zelen \u00ed - greens sso/svobodn \u00ed - mostly a crazy libertarian party,

   greek psychologists established that maria has been abused . 
  they say she is very aggressive and describe her reactions as those of `` a beast . '',

  that 's what he 's supposed to do when the government fails . 
  maybe apolitical is not the correct word , he 's not supposed to represent any political party .

  it 's the color of top09 , the party that paid for it . 
  he 's supposed to be apolitical . 
   he appointed government without any legitimacy from polls what do you mean ? 
  it 's just part of top09 's electoral campaign . 
  that does n't work like that . 
  edit : at least explain what you mean instead of downvoting . 
  dominant and recessive traits do n't disprove my point . 
  dominant genes do n't destroy recessive genes .

  it does n't sound like one , it seems to be a velar lateral approximant or something like that . 
  th can be both voiced and voiceless - think vs. this . 
  it would literary create a police state , how hard can it be to argue against it ,, 
  really ? 
  i thought it stands for a dental fricative , like the english th , while the danish soft d seems to be a velar l. 
  i mean using '' \u0142 '' for the `` soft d '' . 
  i think that \u0142 would be less confusing than \u00f0 . 
  french military interventions seem to be much more successful .

  i ca n't believe you actually stole [ someone else 's comment ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/economics/comments/1nqmf8/swiss_to_vote_on_2500_francmonth_basic_income_for/ccl97ms ) . 
  shame on you . 
  why would it make people move there ? 
  ( assuming it only applies to swis citizens ) 2 . 
  no you did n't 3 . 
  what are you talking about ? 
  that 's my point . 
   in order for this to work you would have to make immigration impossible . 
  why ? 
   rents would immediately rise to a minimum of 1.2 k/month even in the poorest areas . 
  rents can be regulated by a law . 
  how expensive is it now ? 
   it would be impossible to find even a closet-sized apartment for less than 2.5 k in any urban area . 
  wild speculation . 
  you basically expect that everyone will want to extort the poor out of spite . 
   in the end the cost of living increase would balance out any gain . 
  that is clearly false , the increase would affect mostly low income households , but not the rich . 
  are you sure you 're not having a stroke ?

  while babi\u0161 will be likely prime minister , i do n't believe that zeman will win again . 
  draho\u0161 for example have better chance in my opinion . 
  at least let me dream about it :(, 
  nah , sauron is real , there is no reason why anyone would question his existence . 
  in the end , we are the [ mordor of europe ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/58/europe_as_a_queen_map.jpg ), 
  the border between bohemia and bavaria is pretty much the same all the time . 
  however parts of saxony and i believe brandenburg use to be part of bohemian kingdom . 
  i dont have any source for my claim , but i honestly dont believe that 21 % czechs believe in some `` evil eye '' i do n't even know what that is . 
  it 's against president milo\u0161 zeman and finance minister ( vicepremier and bilionare ) andrej babi\u0161 . 
  there has been leaks , where andrej babi\u0161 ( whos owning one of the biggest medias in czech republic ) dictate what those media should write about him and others . 
  there were a lot of other stuff too , but this is the main reason i think . 
  it 's a long and complicated story . 
  we fought for france in [ battle of cr\u00e9cy ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_cr%c3%a9cy ), 
  so what ? 
  australia was always part of eu . 
  we were even part of australia before 1918 . 
  germany and poland , giff back our rightful clay !, 
  seems logical to me , a lot of rich people probably live there . 
  finaly we can together with slovenia into western europe . 
  is there any good info about how many of those jobs is for people with no/low/incompatible education ? 
  could possibly african/me immigrants and refugees fit all those jobs once they learn at least the language ? 
  why should i care what macron parents thinks about his wife ? 
  yes i believe at least 60 % ( does not have to be exactly 60 % , but there should be clear winner of the referendum ) of people should agree in important decisions . 
  results like 51 % can turn around in a short period of time to the oposite direction , every small thing can change the result in any direction . 
  leaving or joining eu is such a long and drastic change , where realy should be clear on which side the population is . 
  people should be definitely more connected to the eu and europe in general . 
  i feel like nobody here care about rest of the europe , discussion only start when eu make decission , and we question what that will mean for czech republic specificaly . 
  your problem needs to be our problem and vice versa , people needs to be connected with other parts of the europe . 
  this will be really unpopular and impossible to even think about right now , but the language is still a main problem why we are so disconnected from each other . 
  if we all speak in one language , many of those problems will simply dissapear over time . 
  our native languages are the main the reason for nationalism if you think about it . 
  i know everyone is proud about his native language ( me too ) , but let 's face it , that 's the main reason why people feels disconnected from each other in europe . 
  the referendum was actualy so retarded . 
  by the time you will be finally out , the public opinion will be probably in favour of the eu . 
  i believe that for such a drastic and important decision to be accepted , should have vote at least like 60-65 % people . 
  what will happen if there is a new referendum about eu in 2019 and `` join '' will win ? 
  and again , i believe for `` join '' should vote at least 60 % of people . 
  exactly , i am not from prague , but i realize that a lot of money from prague goes into another parts of the republic , to make our society more equal . 
  only possible way how eu can really properly work , is if we treat other nations like our own . 
  i expect we will be `` forced '' to join eurozone .

  if there is no globalization at all , everything only on national level . 
  norway is now pretty much poor rural place . 
  your country benefit from globalization maybe the most . 
  i never really cared if i am left or right wing . 
  important is to have your opinion based on truth , and when you are realy proven wrong - admit that , do not find excuses all the time and change your opinion . 
  so globalism or nationalism ? 
  if something , i would say i am somewhere in between ... `` europeanist '' maybe ? 
  in my opinion , we have many problems in europe and we should focus on that first . 
  - i dont blame people from africa because they wan na have better life . 
  - but people in germany wan na have better life like in switzerland . 
  - france wan na have better life like in germany . 
  - italy wan na have better life like in france - czech republic wan na have better life like in italy . 
  - poland wan na have better life like in czech republic . 
  - romania wan na have better life like in poland . 
  - bulgaria wan na have better life like in romania . 
  - ukraine wan na have better life at least like in bulgaria ... and so on . 
  there are huge gaps between nations , even in `` western europe '' , and we should focus on that first , otherwise this will create bad blood between nations and people will not be happy with any immigration . 
  once we have all at least similiar living standards as our neighbours , we can start importing someone else . 
  equality between nations is quintessential if you wan na have functional europe . 
  yes , in limited numbers you can do both ( focus on europe and importing people from somewhere else ) at the same time . 
  but as you can see all over europe , that will not work if eu wan na survive . 
  so , if everything is suddenly central europe . 
  does that mean we are western europe now ? 
  this is here every week . 
  i am not even living in prague , and for me prague is still expesive . 
  but i know how crowded it is all year . 
  we are not rich country , but still people visiting prague because it 's cheap and they wan na save money . 
  i dont blame them , but number of tourists is every year bigger and bigger - everyone want to travel . 
  problem is that you can not simply make the bridges , roads and sidewalks bigger . 
  it is problem like it or not . 
  but blame for it only airbnb and ryanair is unfair . 
  i just hope we will ban him too . 
  i saw some of his movies , one does not simply kill steven seagal . 
  stockholm is more east than prague . 
  welcome in club then . 
  dutch are so tall , but living in such a flat buildings , weird . 
  why eu pushing for this multiculti europe so hard . 
  its one of the main reasons why eu is in crisis and far-right on rise , and i believe main reason why uk left . 
  i think most people have nothing against some natural flow of people . 
  nobody is doing more for africa and middle east than europe . 
  this diversity he is talking about have to be natural process , nothing you can push . 
  if you start importing people from different cultures in thousands , they will be segregated and nobody will be happy including them . 
  people lived in closed cultural groups for thousands years without contact with another distant groups . 
  it is that hard to understand , that you can not simply break this a make globalized world in a short period of time ? 
  we are more and more globalized every single year , differences between cultures and nations are smaller every year . 
  but i would disagree with timmersmans , i think if you push for it too hard it will lead to more xenophobic population and war too . 
  it is .

  that 's not usefull as emergency backup but that is about the right time frame to compensate for natural fluctuations of renewables . 
   they focus on coal due to the unexpected closure of their nuclear plants , and the subsdies for employment that coal mines in germany get . 
  is that because nuclear power plants are unreliable in general or is that because germany is abadoming nuclear power and is for this reason left with older less reliable power plants ? 
  nothing really happen . 
  su did n't take safety seriously to begin with . 
  the point with renewables is unlike nuclear they can not cover 100 % of consumption without major drawbacks . 
  take gemany for example . 
  i think on average 25 % procent of their electricity production is covered by renewables . 
  on the good day they could produce even 100 % . 
  trouble is they can not use that power efficiently because their power grid is lacking . 
  they are just wasting energy . 
  other day they might be producing near to 0 % . 
  i does n't matter how much do you have instaled you will always need primary source which can produce electricity on demand to compensate for bad weather . 
  only nuclear , thermal and hydro can do that . 
  hydro is already maxed out to its potencial and nukes will be banned so only one option is left . 
  no wonder german industry focuses on coal . 
   the problem is that it always is cheaper to cut corners on safety . 
  that 's not true . 
  it 's much cheaper to get such a technology via contract and submit to foreing supervision and comply with their safety standards than to develop it for yourself . 
  i think nuclear and reneables mix is an optimal solution . 
  reneables are secondary power source and unless there will major inovations in grids and energy storage it will remain that way . 
  most countries countries have the technology and those who have often prefer to buy new reactors anyway . 
  it is relatively straight forward to develop but it takes time and resources . 
  so you can if not deny then at least presure them to take the safety seriously . 
  i would n't be for pernament denial of technologies anyway . 
  i am not for nuclear energy as a global energy solution . 
  i think countries which are capable of using nuclear energy safely should do so to reduce co2 emisions . 
  it 's shame that germany abandoning nukes and replacing them with coal . 
  i case of some huge disaster , i expect mildly radioactive water to be least of our problems . 
  it can be build . 
  we are not in hurry plants we have can store their own waste . 
  building a waste storage is just a matter of will . 
  technology is availible . 
  i do n't believe it will ever happen again unless we start exporting nuclear power into unstable third world countries . 
  ussr was really exceptionaly bad at this . 
  this no reason for stable developed countries such a germany to stop using nuclear power . 
  i checked the cook book . 
  czech goulash , hungarian goulash and porkolt are three different recepies . 
  perkolt uses fresh tomatoes hungarian . 
  goulash uses fresh paprikas . 
  czech goulash uses neither of those . 
  that would be 30kg plus glass . 
  how much is it ? 
  15 two-liter glasses ? 
  russia conquered east half of ukraine in 1650 , rest was gradually gained over centuries of wars with poland , austria and the ottomans . 
  i do n't know in which metric is this close to a millenium nor how you can call it living side by side as brothers . 
  actually second thing does n't surprise me that much . 
  in czech language meaning of fraternity was shifted a bit thanks to decades of overuse of the words by the soviet propaganda . 
  first i thought it was a repost but it seems guardian just recycles old [ articles ] ( http://cs.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/24cks5/barbarism_with_a_human_face_by_slavoj_zizek/ ) . 
  no , parlament as a whole put up their candidate . 
  cdu and some other national parties might rebel against epp . 
  i would n't say no to that i just do n't expect it will help much with that hangover . 
  it 's a cure for acetalaldehyde poisoning which is what hangover de facto is . 
  germany does not have same-sex marriage to begin with and afd do n't want to abolish civil unions . 
  could you elaborate on that ? 
  what exactly do you expect will happen if the afd get more power ? 
  i like it . 
  it saves paper . 
  i know what admissible means but what are those rules ? 
  admissible ? 
  how is that you can make ballot paper so compact ? 
  we had to choose from 43 parties . 
  most of those parties have zero chance to get a mandate but they run anyway just because they can . 
  you choose a party you wish to vote for and you may circle up to two candidates then you close it in the yellow envelope you get at the polling station . 
  we use d'hondt method as well . 
  it 's a method of counting votes . 
  it has nothing to do with the shape or form of ballot papers . 
  how does proper vote look like ? 
  i would n't know what to do with this . 
  czech ks\u010cm is a menber of the gue/ngl is a communist party . 
  they are marxist and in some cases stalinist who will deny any wrongdoing on the part of former communist regime . 
  you 're looking at winners in various regions sorted by their affiliation with [ parlamentary groups ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/political_groups_of_the_european_parliament ) . 
  you choose individual groups from the dropbox in the upper right corner to see just their votes . 
  i did n't notice that . 
  i do n't think it 's a political statement though . 
  it says `` oblast irland , irsko '' . 
  '' [ irsko ] ( http://cs.wikipedia.org/wiki/irsko ) '' is short name for the republic of irland . 
  generally all written works , be it law , literature , news articles or scientific papers , are only accessible for the public after they are finished . 
  why should this particular treaty be an exception ? 
  edit : spelling, 
   the lack of transparency and democratic procedures , ... 
  i would like to know exactly how they imagine negotiation process which would they call transarent and democratic . 
  i think current system is sufficient . 
  parlament will have to read and vote on the final text of the agreement . 
  i do n't think participation of our meps in the negotiation process would increase chance of reachig any reasonable compromise . 
   `` it is likely that ttip will address copyright and patents ... '' i would n't call that acta 2.0, 
  you 're saying something can be both true and untrue ?!, 
  you are much crazier than i thought . 
  this conversation is over . 
  your are especialy pathetic human being if you rather claim 2 +2 = 5 than admit your own mistake . 
  nothing can be both certain and uncertain . 
  nothing can be both true and untrue . 
  that is fundamental axiom of logic . 
  to kill means to cause death . 
  both death and causation have clear objective scientific definitions . 
  i do n't see what is so amusing about that . 
   you can write clear instructions without pertaining to a black and white view of the world . 
  you 're contradicting yourself if you can write clear instructions on what is what then the problem is black and white as you say . 
  some problems are black and white . 
  for example killing can be clearly defined by law .

  while i agree that some factors can increase the risk of being raped , the rape is still the fault of the rapist , never the victim , even if she walked naked at 2am around a night club and completely drunk . 
  it 's still not acceptable to rape anyone under any circumstances . 
   before 2008 now that i think about it , i would rather have a problem with a labour shortage than another world financial crisis though :d, 
  ok , you brought up many other issues , like the courts being often bised when deciding about the child 's custody , about the issues of having a child from an affair while being married to someone else or about different attitudes towards the cases of men being raped and women being raped . 
  i 'm not disputing that there are indeed cases where men are discriminated against , the child custody battles are probably the most common example . 
  that is indeed a huge issue . 
  about the rape cases - i think what you described can happen , on the other hand , women 's rape accusations are often met with `` well what did you think , going out late alone , wearing skinny jeans/a skirt - you were basically asking for it '' . 
  both genders can face serious discrimination/prejudices when trying to report a rape . 
  i fail to see how any of this has any connection to the specific case that we 've been discussing though . 
  and that is whether a man should be able to reject his parental duties . 
  i do n't know what you mean . 
  do you mean that we allow women to have abortions ? 
  if so , then it 's not the same , because the child si not yet a child , it 's a fetus . 
  or what exactly are you saying ? 
  yes , i agree with that totally . 
  it really is out of men 's control . 
  you could say it 's unfair , but that 's just how biology made it . 
  i could say that men are on the other hand spared the health risks of being pregnant and giving birth ( or having an abortion ) . 
  imo this is irrelevant to the discussion though , because men can not force women to have an abortion . 
  thus if a woman decides to keep the baby , the baby is born . 
  from that point , it 's no longer about women 's rights or men 's rights , it 's about the child 's rights . 
  yes , it is unfair , but if men want to avoid this , they can make sure to use condoms . 
  getting drunk and having an unprotected sex is not an excuse , that 's just dumb behaviour . 
  again , it 's not implemented in my country . 
  i do n't know about other countries . 
  but even if it was - i do n't suggest it 's `` cool '' at all . 
  i think any situation when a child ends up with only one parent sucks . 
  i 'm just saying that just because there might be a situation when a baby ends up with a mother only ( when a single woman gets pregnant by assisted reproduction ) does n't mean we should encourage more of these situations to happen ( when a kid ends up with a mother only , because the father says `` nope , i do n't want that kid '' during the pregnancy ) . 
  i would argue that purely from the kid 's perspective the latter situation is even worse . 
  because in the first situation , the mother actively decides to have the kid alone , so it 's likely that she knows she can financially afford it . 
  whereas in the second situation when the mother is left alone by the father , she might be in a difficult financial situation , so the child will end up worse off . 
  yes , you 're right that you ca n't force anyone to give parental love . 
  however raising a child costs money , so if the father does n't want to get involved emotionally , it sucks a lot , however he should at least get involved financially . 
  as much as he can say `` i did n't want this kid '' , the kid is still here and he/she needs financial support . 
  if men want to avoid this situation , they can use condoms . 
  or do n't have sex if you ca n't accept the risk of pregnancy . 
  i 'm not sure what is the legislation in other countries , but over here , you can only get an assisted reproduction as long as you 're a couple . 
  but even if this was n't the case - no , it 's not the baby 's fault and it 's not the ideal situation . 
  but just because there is another type of situation when the child ends up with only one parent does n't mean we have to create conditions for yet another situation when this will happen . 
  guess what , when a baby is born , it needs as much support as possible . 
  it 's not the baby 's fault that you slept with a women without accepting that sex can sometimes lead to a baby . 
  it 's not the baby 's fault that you do n't want him . 
  tha child is now here and it needs its parents to support him . 
  the fact that women were biologically given more control over pregnancies is something you might not like , but you ca n't change that . 
  just like women ca n't change that they are ( in most cases ) physically weaker than men . 
  it 's still irrelavent to the discussion though , because this is not about women 's or men 's best interests . 
  once the child is actually born , it should always be firstly about the child 's best interests . 
  and the child 's best interests are to have both of its parents . 
  well yeah , but the gap is closing very slowly . 
  it was not expected by the people that after some 25 years , we 'll still be at 1/3 of german salaries . 
  so it 's kind of hard to attract enough skilled foreigners here . 
  that does n't mean we do n't have any migration , the population growth has actually been positive despite negative natural increase thanks to immigration + fortunately not that many of us leave for western europe as in other ee countries - but in the current economic situation , we simply still do n't have enough people . 
  it 's now so bad that even unskilled positions often ca n't be filled . 
  on the other hand , this will only last as long as the economy is doing very well , so maybe if there is a significant slowing down or even a crisis in the future , this problem will solve itself . 
  yes . 
  wages in germany are cca 3 times higher . 
  well , we 've just finished fourth on this [ expat survey ] ( https://www.expatexplorer.hsbc.com/survey/ ) - beating all other european countries , so there 's that  no , but seriously , regardless of this specific survey , prague is a pretty nice place to live . 
  it can not outcompete the best german/scandinavian cities , it 's still a bit behind them , but it 's not like we 're expecting some massive crowds of western expats to suddenly move here . 
  in prague it depends quite a lot on the location ( whether it 's in the city centre or not ) . 
  outside of the city centre with a bit of luck and patience , you can rent 1 bedroom apartment for some 300-400 euro . 
  in the city centre it gets a bit more expensive ( like maybe up to 550 euro ) . 
  for bigger apartments the prices can be around 600 outside the city centre and go up to 1k in the city centre ) . 
  and i 'm basically talking about the standard apartments , if you want anything fancy , the prices will be obviously higher . 
  also many young people do flat-sharing , so they end up splitting the price and pay less . 
  foreigner sometimes do get scammed , so they end up paying more than locals . 
  mid level meaning some 3 years experience ? 
  if so , my guess would be around 2,5 k - 2,8 k euro gross , so after taxes ( income tax , social and health insurance ) some 1,8 - 2,0 k monthly . 
  there are also some tax discounts ( on kids or other stuff ) so the specific number might vary in each specific case . 
  and in my experience the salaries in it do go up quite quickly once the companies sees it 's really worth investing in you ( because otherwise in this competition , some other company might steal you ) . 
  but note that i 'm actually not living in prague , i 'm living in brno , so take this all with a grain of salt . 
   average it engineer that 's a really broad term . 
  it depends on the specific position , on how much skilled/experienced the candidate is and also on the region/city . 
  the best wages are in prague , followed by other big cities . 
  other areas typically have way lower salaries . 
  but if we focus on prague , people in it are usually in the 1,5 k - 4k euro range ( monthly gross ) . 
  again , depends on the specific position , depends on whether it 's an entry-level position or a senior position . 
  obviously we can not compete with western salaries . 
  but the cost of living is also lower here , so that somewhat compensates for that . 
  yeah , it 's the same in the company i work for ( only part-time , since i 'm also still studying ) . 
  they constantly struggle to find new employees , specially in the it sector . 
   if you can simply expand abroad instructions unclear . 
  * ends up annexing slovakia *, 
  not sure whether we can still be happy about our unemployment rate or more worried about our labour shortage problem . 
  yep , it was iraq . 
  but it was n't these refugees , it was a different group which was resettled directly from middle east camps , not from greece . 
   so again it would limit the pull-factor of the purely economic migrants , which is the goal . 
  it 's not so much about the people already here , but rather the ones thinking about coming . 
  i do n't believe it would . 
  economic migrants do not qualify for the relocation scheme anyway . 
  it 's for syrians/iraqis and eritreans . 
  those who are quite obviously economic migrats - pakistanis , morrocans , tunisians and so on - are not allowed to enter the scheme in the first place . 
  they 're still coming and overwhelming italy . 
  the relocation wo n't help with that , no internal eu rules will help with that . 
  the migrants/refugees see what they want to see , they tend to overestimate the positive signals and ignore the negative signals , plus the smugglers give them fake information ( for obvious reasons ) and their own friends and relatives give them fake information ( because they 're ashamed to admit that they ended up unemployed and on the bottom of the society in europe ) . 
  these people will continue trying their luck , until it 's clear that no one who tries coming illegally will be allowed to go anywhere in europe . 
  the situation in the home countries simply sucks enough for it to be worth it as long as there is at least some chance . 
  some `` you might be send to bulgaria '' threat is not gon na stop them . 
   meaning the goal is to make europe less attractive to economic migrants . 
  i would start with your too generous welfare systems for asylum seekers instead of forcing them on other countries . 
  but anyway , even if you managed to force them on us ( which you so far have n't been able to do , as fico pointed out - pretty much everyone is backing away from the system , at least for now ) , you would n't be able to keep them here .

  and no , i do n't own a gun for self defence . 
  i just like shooting paper . 
  guns are fascinating machines and it 's simply fun to shoot them . 
  it 's just another example of what 's wrong with european union . 
  pushing their non-sense agenda on everyone else . 
  i 'm generally pro-eu , but this decision i 'm really not a fan of . 
  i think it 's pretty .

  but i do n't have a car to put itasha on ( i have a car now , but i will fairly soon be getting rid of as i will live close enough to my work to walk/bike ) . 
  russians ( possibly including ukrainians and such , but i ca n't tell the languages apart ) - horrible . 
  never bother trying to communicate in english or at all , apart from swearing in russian or only communicating with their country man . 
  scandinavians and brits - usually communicative ( in english ) and friendly . 
  germans and french - usually able to communicate in english , but reluctant to . 
  not horrible team mates though . 
  czech and polish - usually pretty awful . 
  especially the poles tend to be pretty toxic , but czech are close behind . 
  all these are mostly based on csgo and world of tanks . 
   it 's by no stretch of the word legal yes , but at the same time , unless you upload hundreds of gigabytes of data , nobody really cares .

  not sure how strongly enforced it is in germany . 
  considering we do n't really know the extend of the separation , it 's really hard to tell . 
  there are talk about staying in the common market and such . 
  i just hope it will make the eu realize it 's far from perfect and reform . 
  i do n't actively follow our environmental policies . 
  i think we are n't phasing out coal fast enough . 
  or at all actually , since it went up in use from 2013-2015 ( ca n't find data for 2016 ) . 
  in 2015 it was 49 % !, 
  ridiculous . 
  problem is that some of our regions have a lot of workforce in mining , so it 's undesirable to push it out in that regard . 
  little over 30 % was nuclear and 12 % was renewable . 
  seems like there is a lot of space for improvement . 
  i would be for building another nuclear power plant ( along with pushing for more renewables ) , but since it 's expensive af , nobody really wants to do it . 
  i do n't think i even met one . 
  a lot of people are fairly indifferent to the issue . 
  it 's going to bite us in the back . 
  i just wonder how fast and whether i will live to see it . 
  but i do n't think it 's really possible to do much about it at this point . 
  i recycle . 
  i do n't drive diesel car . 
  soon , i likely wo n't have drive a car at all once i move . 
  mine looks almost exactly the same . 
  i 'm not 100 % sure what do the funding sliders represent in some cases though , so i did n't mess with them much either . 
  their effect seemed to be pretty small anyway . 
  the gun control question is little strange too , there should have been a multiple-choice on the requirements . 
  sure , when it 's explicitly stated .

   america is the size of europe , so the fact that most americans live their entire life without leaving the country is just the same as the fact that most europeans never leave europe this usually comes up in discussion about how homogenous europe is and how diverse the us is . 
  not trying to start a fight or anything , but the point of the above statement is to show that americans do n't travel much outside of the us and hence have no idea how homogenous the us actually is . 
  i generally say `` meem '' or jokingly `` meymey '' .

  the first presidential election was little similar the the last us one . 
  both candidates were pretty shit , though unlike in the us , mostly harmless . 
  zeman had a lot of support with the older people and with lower classes . 
  he 's way too blunt for a representative of a state . 
  he makes the * the castle * ( prague castle , where the president resides ) seem like a pub . 
  he appeared drunk ( or senile ) at several occasions in public . 
  i acknowledge his political skills , but i just find him unfit for presidential role due to his age . 
   update : funny and odd stories are welcome . 
  [ in 2013 , during presentation of the crown jewels ( or something like that ) he appeared seemingly severely drunk . 
  ] ( https://youtu.be/2cqe0fzegfi ) he ( almost ) fell several times . 
  he lost a shoe few weeks back , because he tripped . 
  as i said , he seems terribly old for this . 
   you should specify eu located . 
  i suppose so , but since i 'm asking europeans and most of europe is in the eu , i suppose it 's close enough . 
   came here to say amazon.com but this does n't do 22eur vat limit . 
  ( it is not a customs limit . 
  customs limit is still 150eur for post ) maybe i 'm not using the correct words , or maybe different institutions control the import here . 
  anything over $ 22 has vat added . 
  anything over $ 150 has import duty added ( and the rate differs based on the kind of goods it is ) . 
  yes , at least it 's $ 22 here . 
  i 'm sure as i import stuff from japan all the time and deal with the customs .

  am i the only one who finds his eyes in this photo extremely disturbing ? 
  just to see who would get butthurt first ... 
  it really depends on the legislation . 
  civil union institution allows for separate laws and treatment from marriage . 
  think adoptions and various family-oriented benefits . 
  so it could ( and does ) lead to unequal treatment of unionized vs. married couples by state . 
  we do n't have any special school buses , kids go to school by public transportation , with parents or walk . 
  mind you that thanks to our population density most elementary schools are really within walking distance from your home . 
  secondary schools are quite worse , but still , we have pretty neat transportation system ( i lived across town ( pop 300k ) from my hs and it took me longer to get to school by tram than my my friend who commuted from another town by train . 
  anecdotically i passed 5 different hs during my morning commute . 
  is there any way to share that list ? 
  thanks !, 
  right ? 
  living in a city near polish border with major party culture - the polish dresy folk . 
  rude , stabby , loud as fuck , pissing and puking everywhere , parking on resident spots . 
  but in the other hand who can blame them when their beer is just hops-flavoured piss . 
  some folks have also troubles with spanish exchange students here , they may be loud , but i guess they are quite nice . 
  but still we do n't get many russians , and from what i 've seen in prague , they can get into totally different level of rude . 
  offcourse the worst people everybody has to deal with here are the locals . 
  i believe that natural selection or classical darwinism could n't apply here - we are not solitary species , we do n't survive as individuals but as a society . 
  and within the society even childless individuals can be of merit and thus improving survivability of all . 
  oh , you 're right . 
  what i meant was that people should n't care about what strangers are doing with their own genitalia . 
  it 's so sad , really . 
  people need to stop obsessing about other people 's dicks . 
  still he is an arrogant douche who just loves to listen to himself .

  wan na sniff that peppershaker again ? 
  last time was not enough ? 
  which would solve exactly what ? 
  yeah , in the other hand we are not that good with the compass thingy apparently . 
  you will see us again in couple of months , flip-floping your mountains :-), 
  so ... basically profiting on the misery of others ? 
  edit : a word, 
  hear hear !, 
  my point was that this argument is just flawed and it 's usage is popular but hollow . 
  we have a lot of problems that are being solved for extremely long time and yet everytime a new problem occurs populists start to coming up with easy solutions to old problems , trying to appeal to fake sense of social justice . 
  people who couple of months ago would pick up the homeless and drive them outside the towns to let them freeze to death are now preaching help to the homeless . 
  it disgusts me . 
  we had decades , maybe centuries to do that . 
  there are two of you using one account or what ? 
  i think more of cheap loans , preferential treatment of newlyweds and young families , especially in housing distribution , there were also financial incentives towards your first and probably second child . 
  basically we went saudi arabia on families . 
  well you try it !, 
  that depends on the point of view - poles are just generally better merchants , i can always ask for reasonable price reduction and mostly get it if buying sufficient ammount . 
  in here it 's almost unheard of , once fixed price is fixed , even in small stalls or farmer 's markets . 
  the bad food production ... well it goes fom our buy only cheapest stuff mentality . 
  people get what they pay for . 
  yep . 
  we hate everything . 
  are they really that good ? 
  my friend works at hyundai plant ( ix20 , i30 , ix35 ) and he strongly discouraged me from getting one ... 
  not generally . 
  you have right to fend off an attack by reasonable force , like not gunning down a dude runnng at you with a knife . 
  our self defence laws are simply retarded , this is set to fix one instance . 
  people are buying subpar shit because the quality products that are being sold by the same company cost significantly more . 
  its only a matter of morals versus blind chase of profit . 
  in czechia most companies chase high short term profit instead of longterm steady one . 
  capitalism simply does n't work when people in charge of corporations does n't understand how it should work . 
  right and right . 
  still my argument is that his occupation was not his doing . 
  i really do n't know about that - direct responsibility for current state of affairs was franz josef ii , who ruled with iron-clad fist , not his son , who was not in much position to rule . 
  in fact franz ferdinand was considered to be a friend and ally to slavic peoples in the monarchy so he would be probably the greatest asset even for serbian kingdom to resolve the situation peacefully . 
  but no , young fundamentalists always know better . 
   public transportation exists , people can use that to get to work in a different nearby city where there is more work . 
  there are even programmes that financially compensate the travel costs for unemployed people . 
  look at the map of poorest regions and compare it with existing infrastructure and public trasport options there and then slap yourself . 
  do n't remind me of princip ... you know we had a quite okay-ish thing going on with franz ferdinand . 
  keep burgenland !, 
  dude , d1 is between prague and polish border near bohum\u00edn , brno is half way . 
  the older highways are being repaired . 
  but because the only criteria for czech public works is final price it 's taking extremely long . 
  and the new highways are so flimsily built that they are falling into pieces . 
  we have a part near bohum\u00edn that are restricted to 60 km/h because of extensive damage . 
  on a road that is not even 10 years old . 
  the east really suffers because of bad infrastructure , driving to prague is a nightmare no matter which road you take . 
  there is no highway connection to vienna , there is not enough connections to germany and the only highway to slovakia is concrete panels glued together with some tar . 
  and polish weekend drivers are homicidal maniacs . 
  overall not worth getting the vignette at all . 
  not that much , but i have it at home all the time . 
  but to be honest , i recently found that i like er\u0151s pista better . 
  i have bought quite old diesel octavia in germany and while it ate quite a lot of money for repairs my overall cost of ownership is now on 7.05 czk per km and constantly decreasing with fuel being 1.6 czk per km . 
  new car in my price range would be around 12-15 czk per km constant , so it 's not that bad . 
  i got it for road trips since i like my vacations unorganized and not in one place . 
  it 's also great for hauling groceries . 
  around 1500 czk .

  interesting ( except the last sentence felt like a setup for a disgusting joke at first ) i would still go for what locals eat ... btw . 
  as sicily is close to sardinia , have you tried casa marzu ? 
  haha i am voting for this one . 
  or waiting for some leechestehian to confirm one of the alternatives . 
  i expected something else . 
  these seem to be good cultural advice . 
  but today i would mostly avoid speaking good about the us , ukraine or opposition , talking trash about great vladimir and such ... 
  i thought the idea was to get simple meals with top quality ingredients . 
  at least that 's how i idealize italian cuisine without visiting in last 15 years . 
  that 's true . 
  nudism was strong in cz and eastern germany . 
  here 's the tricky part . 
  we stand no chance even at the seashore . 
  we are too boring and ordinary for them i guess . 
  well ... 
  i live in cz and they are more civil here ... so that 's what they do on their vacations ? 
  you watch too much pr0n, 
  haha # 33 `` after creaming my face '' ... this guy rocks . 
  on top of the wife 's facial and metallica ... also a question for guys talking about this being middle class . 
  is this middle class when the house and both cars are paid off or is everything borrowed from the bank ? 
  polish in ireland - not sure if englanders but probably smarter and richer people than us . 
  so we would display some envy when calling them names . 
  imagine how many countries is the uk involved with , either historically or because of their current population . 
  imagine how many countries is the uk involved with , either historically or because of their current population . 
  you do . 
  no attacks , no occupation . 
  karkonosze mountains are hard to overcome in tanks . 
  bad news incoming . 
  you are englanders too . 
  at least in cz and sk are gb , uk and england equivalent in informal spoken language, 
  i confirm this for the czech and slovak languages . 
  no idea why . 
  so what do you do in vienna ? 
  the city center is almost completely taken over by tourist industry . 
  crowded and fullof bullshit like the segway tours , selfie sticks , russian orthodox souvenirs , polish amber , made-up museums of spiders , torture , communism and such . 
  but so beautiful . 
  perhaps come off season . 
  also note that there 's a lot of modern architecture outside this zone , as a student of architecture you would appreciate the cubist houses , afaik only in prague did cubism take the form of architecture ? 
  also early 20th century villas at the baba hill ... 
  agree on the art noveau . 
  we have many of them here in prague . 
  i was thinking that i perhaps see some common treats with josip plecnik 's work in prague - kostel nejsvetejsiho srdce pane - but my finance and free time manager says no . 
  found this . 
  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/house_of_the_blackheads so what i see is 1886 , you spotted also thd 16th elements . 
  i thought they 're were also modern but that can be the renovation from 1990s ... 
  she says neogothic . 
  kind of eclectical . 
  that would be the end of 19th century ? 
  i 'll ask google . 
  i insist but i am not an expert . 
  i 'll ask the wife and report back . 
  the building on the right , i mean on the main picture , is definitely modern and has some art noveau . 
  it is stunning . 
  coming up next : countries with weapons on their flags . 
  and a special award goes to the one with kalashnikovs . 
  i think that it is obvious that the police was playing a non-democratic game and their reasoning is faulty . 
  i misunderstood part of the text , because there were real snipers outside and potential snipers inside . 
  aha ok , i read too fast . 
  my feeling is that the whole article is a misunderstanding and the police was afraid of a sniper behind the flag . 
  way to make friends , internet european buddy . 
  i recommend anyone interested to look up a video . 
  spanking = symbolic touch of a home-made willow-tree whip with lot of textile stripes on the end . 
  no one 's hurt . 
  in some reagions a water is poured over a woman or a perfume is used ( in smaller amount than water ) . 
  if anyone gets hurt it is because sometimes people are idiots . 
  you can drive a car on the street but some drive into the river at 150mph . 
  i propose looking at it as a social activity where people visit the neighbors and relatives under pretext of the whipping . 
  you can see the spanking and pouring of cold water can change into beating and throwing into the creek if taken to extreme . 
  it is not a normal sight . 
  i also like visiting hungary . 
  especially thermal spas and hungarian cuisine . 
  i really do n't want to stir bad feelings here , but my impression is that both sides are infected first by their national movement leaders and then by their historians and politicians . 
  what i mean - during my discussions with hungarian colleagues i must avoid all history or political topics because they are like from different planet . 
  it 's like having a communist uncle , you do n't want to be engaged into a political debate during the family reunion . 
  but this is with regular people , not one person . 
  they think that slovaks liked being a part of hungary and want to go back , that those were good old times for both nations etc. 
  or they keep forgetting that pre-1918 hungary was a multi-national state and not hungarians + hungarians who could n't speak hungarian . 
  on the slovak part , people who have problems with hungary live in a 100 % pure slovak regions which is an irony . 
  we enlarge the historical problems ( a myth of a 1000-year slavery ) , suspect slovak hungarians of trying to steal a part of country and deliver it to hungary . 
  and refuse to build a citizen state instead of a slovak nation state . 
  see the preable of the constitution . 
  i know . 
  good old times right ? 
  why ... you can also fall in love with a random country on the map with which you do n't border . 
  no frictions ... 
  bonus points if your government gets into the same problems with the eu . 
  in return i understand the first sentence that pl and hu vomit into the same cup . 
  no it 's not . 
  hungary has problems in relationship with every neighboring nation . 
  that 's why they love poles , it 's a long distance dreamed up relationship that ca n't get into problems . 
  edit - since i am getting upvotes in a topic i would much rather proclaim brotherhood , the truth is that hungarian-slovak relationship is not bad in the last years . 
  the politicians on both sides sometimes try to raise hate , sometimes are friendly , sometimes the friendliness is because of the negative thing like the opposition towards eu and such ... there is much to be improved but i hope that there 's no real hate among the regular people and there is more positive than negative ... 
  based on my memories of the debacle with the three armored vehicles in 2001 i believe this ship goes only downstream and leaks oil , so it can only be used to attack saxonia and perhaps denmark , netherlands or the uk depending on the weather . 
  i found this - http://zpravy.idnes.cz/dalsi-transportery-cekaji-v-kasarnach-dxl-/domaci.aspx?c=a010927_132834_domaci_itu in 2001 cz army wanted to protect the prague building of radio free europe . 
  they found less than 10 armored vehicles . 
  4 left hodonin ( 250km away ) , one broke down on the way , one died in prague , two arrived . 
  they stood in the city center and leaked oil . 
  uff . 
  thank you . 
  i was afraid of the photo in the hot tub .

  why use it ? 
  temperatures during the summer are annoying , sure , but a big fan suffices . 
  it 's too expensive to be worth it . 
  even in offices it 's not very common . 
  the place where i work has one in the server room , 
  anyone can run for president in many european countries as well . 
  in czech rep. you would need 50k petition , but you could . 
  nope . 
  i even set up couple filters for all the us election stuff on the front page . 
  my knowledge goes about this far : - hillary is winning so far - sanders not so much - trump i 'm not even sure , he seems more like a meme than a presidential candidate at this point . 
  hopefully loosing . 
  - the elections are badly organized but i 'm pretty lost in the vocabulary . 
  like what are * primaries * , or even what do the political parties actually stand for . 
  and i do n't particularly care . 
  because some people could be * butthurt * that some people do n't need to learn the new language . 
  esperanto is artificial . 
  i think many of us asked themselves this question . 
  i certainly have and i 'm yet to arrive at a concrete answer . 
  the top of the list would be probably sweden or denmark . 
  i 've visited both as a tourist and it felt a little like utopia ( which at closer look surely would n't be so amazing , but the short visit was really nice ) . 
  i particularly liked that the language barrier is n't really there since everyone speaks english ( of course , i would have to learn the local language eventually , which is a pain ) . 
  but i 'm not sure how i feel about the extreme political correctness that seems to be particularly strong in these countries . 
  than there is britain . 
  i speak english fluently ( though i would have to get used to the accents ) . 
  i love the weather . 
  but i strongly disagree with their privacy policy and general handling of the internet . 
  also , camera everywhere , it just feels wrong . 
  and no guns , i like shooting paper and uk does n't offer enough for me to give that up . 
  overall , while i have plenty of problems with my native country , i 'm fairly happy here . 
  not many if i only count those where i actually spent some time , not just passed trough . 
  - france - sweeden - denmark - ukraine - bulgaria - croatia currently , i have plans to visit sweden again , and i would love to visit italy some time soon . 
  i 've never heard of a * gap year * , so i 'm pretty sure it 's not a thing here ( czech republic ) . 
  at least not planned . 
  people of course drop out during the first semester of uni and if they want to give it another shot , they have to wait till the summer to apply again . 
  i would be willing to add one sentence to the description of the pacific campaign , mentioning the extend of japanese occupation ( though it 's quite likely we have a map in the books , i just do n't remember it ) . 
  i do n't mean disrespect to anyone , particularly not victims of war , but it really did n't have any meaningful impact on the outcome of the war . 
  struggle of the people is `` taken for granted '' during a war , there is no need to highlight it . 
  do you think people occupied by the nazis in europe did n't consider it * a crucible for their respective countries * ? 
  it 's no different , it 's like that everywhere there is a war . 
  no need to specifically mention it . 
  never seen anyone do this and i used to go to the pool pretty regularly when i was a kid . 
  i never had any health problems because of it . 
  afaik , usa ended up overpowering the japanese anyway , did n't they ? 
  the japanese just did n't want to officially to admit the defeat . 
  of course , usa knew perfectly well they did n't have any chance if they were to land in japan and defeat them completely . 
  so they dropped the nukes . 
  honestly , i do n't think much would have changed is the usa had n't nuked them ( as far as ww2 goes ) . 
  yes , pacific campaign as a whole was important . 
  but what i 'm saying is that there was n't anything particularly notable about it apart from it 's start and the end . 
  like with most people here , we mentioned japanese war with china , attack on pearl harbor and the nukes . 
  and that 's about it . 
  i wonder , what do you learn about it ? 
  from my point of view , nothing of particular importance happened there apart from the things mentioned . 
  but of course , having not read anything about it , i may be wrong . 
  the warfare aspect is always mentioned only in passing . 
  usually just an outcome of a campaign or some period of time . 
  we mention few important battles in europe , but again , it 's mostly just line or two of text . 
  i can only think of stalingrad , kursk , battle of britain and d-day . 
  as for variety of brands , i will use your example with sweet cocacola-like drinks . 
  most supermarkets will offer coca cola ( at least the regular one , but often also zero and/or vanilla ) , pepsi ( regular , lemon and sometimes light ) , kofola ( local variation of such drinks , very interesting btw ; regular , sugar-free , lemon and elderberry ; there are also seasonal flavours like gingerbread , chocolate and few others ) , and their own branded version ( usually shit and cheap ) . 
  some even have drpepper . 
  it also depends on size of the store , the selection changes almost weekly in smaller stores , so they may have pepsi one week and coca cola the next . 
  as for fast food , we have kfc , mcd , couple pizza places and couple kebab/gyros places . 
  there are more local fast foods in the bigger cities though . 
  i was describing 70k city . 
  usually a couple middle class ones . 
  i think we have 2 or 3 here in the 70k city . 
  i would say they are about as popular as any other kind of specialized ( in specific cuisine ) restaurant . 
  i ca n't wouch for authenticity of their meals though , since i know very little about proper mexiacn cuisine . 
  it is mandatory in school ( plus one additional language - most schools offer german , russian and spanish or french ) . 
  also my mother placed a lot of importance on learning english ( she does n't speak it herself ) so i went to english language courses for many years and got up to c1 certification ( currently thinking of trying c2 ) . 
  but it 's not as if i was forced into it . 
  well , i was in the beginning , but at one point i started to enjoy it . 
  at this point , i ca n't imagine living without english . 
  it 's absolutely necessary for an it person ( even more for a programmer ) and about 99 % of entertainment i consume is in english or subtitled in english ( anime ) . 
   how do you treat internal tourists ? 
  do you expect fellow europeans to speak your language in your country ? 
  i do n't live in tourist location , but i usually try to help , just like i would if a local asked me for directions . 
  and no , i do n't expect a tourist to speak czech , that 's crazy . 
  i assume every tourist speaks english though . 
  i suppose i worded that wrong . 
  what i mean is that as far i know , there is n't any publicly known censorship . 
  sure , it 's the history written by the victors , but imho the way it 's taught is fine and for the most part accurate . 
  there is n't anything anyone would bother arguing about as of now . 
  none that i 'm aware of . 
  it 's a rare topic . 
  ww2 is viewed as history and therefore there is little to discuss . 
  and as far as opinion differences go , people may have different views whether we ( czechoslovakia back then ) should have fought nazi germany or not , but in the end , nobody really cares . 
  it 's history . 
  czech rep. is very small country - ~ 400x220km . 
  but yeah , 100-200km is a considerable distance . 
  it 's not completely unheard of for people to take a train from prague ( capital ) to brno ( 2nd largest city ) for school/work ( ~ 200km ) , but it 's inconvenient and most people would n't be willing to do it . 
  to give you some insight . 
  czech republic here . 
  small * city * of 3k . 
  6 bus stops . 
  2 bus routes ( one to each bigger city near by ) . 
  bus to the 70k city ( 10km from here ) comes every 30-60 minutes ( from 5am to 10pm ) . 
  bus from there to capital city ( ~ 30km ) comes every 10-20 minutes . 
  there are also 4 train station in the 70k city that have direct trains to the capital that come pretty often ( i do n't take the train so i do n't know the specifics ) .

  you do n't have to be rich to live there and the majority certainly is n't ( including me ) , but to buy a house you have to be rich . 
  people live in flats , the rich buy houses . 
  `` normal '' people buy houses in the metro area and commute . 
  i wish you were right, 
  so how many are usa gon na take in ? 
  yes , definitely [ london ] ( http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/7f8c5d3e-5620-11e5-a28b-50226830d644.html ), 
  i guess munich and hamburg and all the small towns around alps and bodensee, 
  i do n't know if they mean only houses or flats as well . 
  houses are expensive in prague , flats not as much . 
  who wants house for `` normal '' price , usually buy one on the outskirt of the city and in the regions around . 
  i think , the most expensive capital to buy a house have to be london . 
  but i liked your pavillon . 
  it was quite cute with the swings inside . 
  is it possible to predict correctly for 35 years ahead ? 
  yes , [ coop everywhere ] ( http://www.coop.cz/ ), 
  is n't english originally from denmark , from continent ? 
  + some latin and french ? 
  we take back what 's ours !, 
  the data are adjusted per million inhabitants, 
  they carry their stigma of the past and it affect their decisions even today . 
  they want to appear as pacifist as possible . 
  i have googled some and neither of them was handsome , sorry ( maybe , i am spoiled here in cz ), 
  it 's both . 
  people will look at you ( especially if you are men or if you have a family ) like you are useless and they 'll judge you ( behind your back mostly , but in the way that it 'll get to you ) . 
  your own family will judge you as well , so it 's a pressure for you to get something . 
  if you have a job outside of your qualification , they 'll feel a bit pity for your hard times but mostly they would appreciate your attitude and they 'll wish you all the best for better job opportunity . 
  if you are on benefits , people think that you do n't try hard and that you are lazy . 
  also , when you get to job interviews , they do n't appreciate much that you have been on benefits . 
  we had crisis for 5 years ( 2008-2013 ) , so we are just working on many projects now , which were postponed due to the former situation . 
  also , we are closely connected with germany . 
  if they 're doing well , we should do as well . 
  we have strong industry sector and it seems , that it does well right now . 
  also , i should mention czech nature toward jobs , people work even outside of their specialisation and for lower wages , than they should . 
  to be unemployed is seen as a stigma here ( especially for men ) , so ingeniers and teachers will work as waiters and cashiers if they have to . 
  in some countries they would just wait on benefits , not here really . 
   probably eurostat trying to make us look bad or something . 
  yes , that 's the cause / ^ s maybe , the british statistical office does n't cooperate with eurostat so well and does n't want to give them the data - probably dreaming about brexit already . 
  i 've read that they did n't reform and diversified their economy . 
  they are heavily dependant on tourism and other small services , also agriculture . 
  also , the problem is their fiscal policy which slow down investments + high debt . 
  why is estonia doing so well in the region when compared to finland and latvia ? 
  i 'm from very old families and i have even celtic blood in my veins . 
  i am the true representative of czech nation by blood , and not some fop from salzburg . 
  where is my throne ? 
  i am the first ruler of the new dynasty . 
  you all kneel on your knees before your king !, 
  did i forget to mention , that i am going to be an absolutist monarch ? 
  so , you would n't mind if i become your monarch . 
  i have been there 2 weeks ago . 
  i was surprised about the queues and that it took so long to get into pavilions . 
  italians were very disciplined , czechs would complain a lot to wait just half a hour . 
  i liked the pavilions of azerbaijan , estonia and the italian pavilions . 
  unlike italy and some other ones , many countries took it as a self presentation and there were not so many new technologies or visions on display which would relate to expo theme . 
  btw , the food in milano was amazing !, 
  truth !, 
  czechs never wanted to part of it . 
  maybe , you are [ austroslavist ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/austro-slavism ) , but they were taken almost as a curiosity . 
  czechs are weirdos , everyone knows it . 
  creeping federation ? 
  we definitely help to make it less creepy with our attitude . 
  ofcourse we wanted to join eu very badly . 
  we just like to complain a lot about everything . 
  i think , eu is a success story for europe , when taken in a nutshell . 
  unfortunately , many have a short memory and like to blame the first thing what comes on their mind . 
  a-h was the prison of nations, 
  we have half a million immigrants , but they are mostly from eastern europe ( ukraine , russia ) or east asia ( vietnam , china ) . 
  there are n't immigrants from levant or muslim countries . 
  that 's why , there is this craziness going on . 
  people fear these immigrants , because they do n't have any experience with them + media massage + the current crisis + populists . 
  i feel ashamed, 
  central european countries are following : germany , austria , switzerland , liechtenstein , czech rep. , poland , slovakia , hungary and slovenia !, 
  * central eastern : czech rep. , poland , slovakia , hungary and slovenia * central western : germany , austria , switzerland and liechtenstein, 
  germany and austria are central e. !, 
  that pic could relate to czech nature :-), 
  ... for slovaks . 
  they were part of the hungarian side of a-h , and very undeveloped . 
  czechs were sending there their teachers , ingeniers etc. 
  also , unlike much of europe , full industrialization of slovakia was achieved after world war ii . 
  i take just the easiest sources now , but i am sure you can dig deeper for info if you 're interested . 
  [ pagaism ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/christianity_and_paganism ) , [ lgbt ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/history_of_homosexuality ), 
  christianity just installed itself on already existing pagan traditions and holidays in europe . 
  only this way , they could convert europeans for their thing . 
  pagan europe has shaped christianity more than the other way round . 
  so , europe can freely exist without christianity , as it does for many millenia before . 
  homosexuality was highlighted or tolerated in some societies and persecuted in others . 
  unfortunately , christianity has chosen the negative attitude . 
  catholicism and religion in general , is declining in europe , if you like it or not . 
  the church has changed many times over the course of history and it will happen many times in the future . 
  christianity is not stable as you may think . 
  this faith from middle east is here just for 2 millenia and only 1 millenium when it conquered the whole continent of europe . 
  1 millenium is nothing when compared to european history . 
  the greek , roman , germanic , celtic and slavic gods were here for much longer time . 
  regarding homosexuality , it existed since the beginning of times in every culture and every society , so some made-up doctrine wo n't change it at all . 
  transgender, 
  why should n't i ? 
  do you have a problem with questions ? 
  the church had always problems with questions . 
  unlike then , they ca n't burn me alive for asking . 
  that 's the difference between us , i do n't believe in demons unlike you , but in facts . 
  their belief that homosexuality is in their words an inclination which is objectively disordered , is the wrong thing here .

  however if it somehow did happen , i 'd be thrilled , it would be great to have the uk back . 
   no , asylum process - who you give asylum or not - is within hands of national states that are bound by geneva international treaties . 
  that 's true , but the eu can decide who is responsible for handling the asylum application . 
  which is exactly what dublin determines . 
  it 's true that it collapsed , but that does n't change the fact that the eu has authorities over this . 
   if i were you i 'd worry more about migration wave from subsaharan africa that is being hit by one wave of drought by another creating food crisis all around continent that can be contained by food aid only so long . 
  yes , i am worried about that as well . 
  i 'm worried about the instability everywhere in the european neighbourhood . 
  nowadays when transportation is way easier and cheaper than it used to be some decades ago , even areas which were n't that relevant for europe are nowadays relevant . 
   so in other words , you 'll just leave it all onto italy and greece until their system collapses like what happened in 2015 in greece and then blame greece and italy who were left dead in water , to handle hundreds of thousands of migrants . 
  cool . 
  i want to help greece and italy by preventing the migrants from reaching their country and i also would n't be completely against the idea of taking some limited number of refugees . 
  however i 'm absolutely against signing a blank cheque to the commission . 
  i do not have any faith that the commission and we will be able to have a tougher stance on migration next time when another crisis comes , so there is absolutely no way to know how many refugees the commission might try to assign to us . 
  but yes , in general , i 'm primarely concerned about my country and about the citizens of my country . 
  that does n't mean i do n't want to help greece and italy , but i do n't put them above my own country . 
  signing a blank cheque to the commission is simply too risky . 
  no , it does n't , asylum policy is a shared authority of the eu and the member states . 
  the dublin rules regulate asylum policy on the eu level . 
  and i know that we 're not taking any refugees from outside of the eu , we have tried that once and they just immediately left to germany , so we 're not doing that anymore . 
  that does n't change anything about my opinion that i would like the asylum policy to be solely in the authority of the national governments . 
  from my perspective , it 's not really about those current 2,6 k refugees in greece and italy . 
  it would n't kill us to take those . 
  i more so worry about what precedent it sets for the future . 
  the mena region is a ticking time bomb and i 'm pretty certain that at some point , there will be another migration wave coming . 
  the commission has already been trying to revise the entire eu asylum system and put there a pernament relocation scheme which would be triggered every time there is a crisis with no upper limit . 
  so to be honest , at this point , i trust my government that it will be more able and willing to protect my country from any future big migration waves more than i trust the eu . 
  and that is coming from someone who is normally very critical about czech politics . 
  lol , you really know absolutely nothing about the czech republic , right ? 
  our lgbt legislation and public attitude towards lgbt is on approximately the same level as in germany , we 're the most israel-friendly country in europe and anti-semitism is basically non-existent here . 
  islamophobia is a problem here though , i 'll give you that . 
   does that seem like a good idea to you ? 
  i do n't think any country should be forced to accept refugees against its will . 
  i would like asylum and migration policy to remain in the hands of the national governments , not in the hands of the eu . 
  obviously i realize that the decision is now legally binding , so i would agree with taking some minimum number of refugees , similarely to slovaks , so that we get the commission of our back . 
  in the meantime , i want my government to focus all its efforts to help stabilize mena , so that people do n't have a reason to flee . 
  it is the most efficient way to be helpful , since none of the mena refugees have any interest in staying in my country . 
  we all know that the agreement was made in 2015 , that does n't mean we agree with the agreement . 
  my country was against it from the beginning and was outvoted . 
  so please stop making it look as if we ` made ' the agreement . 
  it was voted through the qmv , against the votes of the czech republic , slovakia , hungary and romania . 
   the fact that you do , again , says more about your political maturity . 
  oh yeah , absolutely . 
  i do not deny that our political culture is not as developed as in the most of western european countries . 
  it sucks , but we have to work with what we have . 
   expecting the eu to care about your selfishness and hypocrisy enough to indulge it is ridiculous . 
  selfishness - perhaps . 
  even though i could argue that my country is actually doing quite a lot to help stabilize the middle east . 
  we just do n't want to take refugees from there , but that does n't mean that we do n't do anything . 
  in terms of cee countries and if we take into account population size and gdp , the czech republic is absolutely among the most active when it comes to both military , humanitarian and financial engagements in mena . 
  but hypocrisy - that 's fucking hilarious . 
  the commission are masters of hypocrisy , so accusing others of it just makes me laugh . 
  the entire quota system is a disaster , it does n't work , the refugees are n't staying in their assigned countries , yet the commission with a straight face praises its sucess . 
  the commission is eager to enforce rules against the czech republic , poland and hungary , yet when france is breaking the budgetary rules , juncker says that france ca n't be sanctioned , because ` it 's france ' . 
  if this is n't hypocrisy , than i do n't know what is . 
   if you want to shoot yourself in the foot over an issue and lose a lawsuit against the eu over petty politics then feel free to do so . 
  i obviously do n't , i wish this was n't escalated to this level , unfortunately it 's where we are . 
  as for now , our politicians simply can not take a step back , it 's not a petty politics for them , it 's about their political survival . 
   eastern europeans are still mostly fundamentalist christians yeah , yeah , there are so many fundamentalist christians in the czech republic , we 're literaly the second vatican / s. 
   who cares about your internal politics ? 
  our politicians do . 
  this is not an everyday political squabble . 
  this is a high-profile issue in the czech republic which is extremely unpopular among the public . 
  no politician or political party will wilingly shoot themselves in their foot in the pre-election period . 
  that would n't happen in any country . 
  just like for example in germany , no candidate will campaign with the promise to cut off greek debt . 
  it 's possible that our politicians might do a u-turn after the elections , but i would n't count on that . 
  and btw . 
  slovakia and hungary filed a lawsuit against the legality of the quotas and the ruling has not come yet , so there 's still a possibility that the decision might be revoked . 
   hopefully that is a lesson these countries are not too arrogant to learn . 
  not gon na happen here , we 're in a pre-election period now . 
  the elections take place in october . 
  any party which would agree with the quota policy can forget about scoring a solid result . 
  everybody is going to be against it , because the public is overwhelminly against it . 
  so the only thing the commission is going to achieve is that whoever is in our future government will have an even tougher stance on the quotas than the current government . 
   so it is not about costs any more ? 
  what ? 
  i just told you that the resettlement programmes are n't led by the eu , they 're not mandatory . 
  we voluntarily joined the programme and then decided to quit , because we did n't want our money to be invested in people who just use us as a free travel agency that will take them to germany . 
  so it absolutely is about the costs and about the unwillingess to spend money on people who have no intention to stay in our country . 
   well , you are now getting sued over failing to observe eu rules and that also sounds completely reasonable to me . 
  people that violate rules they undersigned should be sued . 
  this is about about failing to comply with the relocation programme , which is not the same as the resettlement programme . 
  i agree that it would have been better if we just took a few more refugees this year , just like slovaks did ( they took just 4 more people than us and are n't getting sued ) . 
  then the refugees would leave anyway but we could pretend like we contributed and did our duty , which is apparently enough for the commission . 
  resettlement and relocation are two different things . 
  the resettlement programmes are voluntary , nobody has to take part in them . 
  we tried it and it did n't work out , the people did n't want to stay in our country , so we decided to quit the programme . 
  seems like a completely reasonable thing to me . 
  we 're one of the most atheist countries in the world . 
  well i do n't think our people are very eager to pay for travel costs for refugees in the middle east who mistake our country for a travel agency which will cover their all-inclusive trip to germany . 
  in general , people usually find it offensive when they offer genuine help to someone and that someone immediately after that spits in their face . 
  thus politicians would find it impossible to explain why shoud our tax payers fund such a thing . 
  i get that the refugees would rather be in germany than in the czech republic , but i do n't see why my country should fund their desires . 
  that was our attempt at resettling people directly from the middle eastern refugee camps . 
  the original plan was to take some 100 , but the first group escaped to germany very shortly after they were transported here , so the whole scheme was stopped . 
  from that point , we decided not to take part in resettlement programmes . 
  yeah , it has almost no support among the british political parties , so it 's not gon na happen . 
  it 's too bad though , i would love to have the uk back . 
  it would be so great if brexit could somehow be reversed .

  exchange of money , goods or services . 
  they can rely on public support . 
  and from all i know the balance of good vs. bad lobbying is so incredibly out of balance for the bad side , that this move is absolutely 100 % worth it and will benefits the whole society . 
  what the heck are you talking about ? 
  economics is a field that apart other things studies how companies work , and part of that is studying lobbying and its effects . 
  for example there are studies evaluating the * return on investment * of lobbying for companies , where you can learn that instead of complying with regulations , companies often make better use of their money by lobbying because it is oftentimes several thousand times cheaper . 
  that 's what i meant , i do n't care who you are at all . 
  i am not at all against communication between anyone and elected representatives . 
  i am against the narrowly understood lobbying where exchange of money , goods or services takes place , which i believe has to be illegalized . 
  i 'm not very hopeful myself to be honest . 
  but it is important to remember what lobbying is , and to do what we can against it . 
  exactly . 
  talking is absolutely fine . 
  but any exchange of money , goods or services has to be made illegal , because it * is * bribery . 
  that 's like avoiding aids by not having sex . 
  it mostly works , but i 'd rather find a better solution . 
  i 'm 100 % for that . 
  due to my economics background * , i can tell you with certainty that lobbying creates much more harm than good . 
  and if people actually care about some issue , they can lobby independently as people . 
  that way , the will of the actual people gets the most say . 
  edit : \\* * since some people consider economics to be a dark science - i 'm not boasting to be an all knowing wizard !, 
  the study of economics simply includes the study of companies and their use of lobbying , that 's why i 'm mentioning it here . 
  also , i 'd like free movement for internet packets . 
  why ca n't i watch the french netflix here in czech republic ? 
  especially since netflix does n't offer any service here what so ever . 
  well , i think we should make lobbying illegal . 
  it 's nothing but a legal form of bribery . 
  i think tom waits solved it best when he sang * the piano has been drinking ( not me ) * . 
  ( in my country that is someone who * does n't * drink ... ), 
  right , of course . 
  no , they 're waiting until they can just roll over it . 
  i think you misunderstood , he said alcohol . 
  and the jews . 
  religious people are by definition not that good with logic . 
  ha , i actually like that . 
  sue me !, 
  even today hungary is getting * pretty * fascist . 
  well , much of europe * did * become fascist years ago . 
  hitler , mussolini , franco , also hungary and other countries . 
  it 's just that it did n't really work out then . 
  in czech we have this tongue twister , a whole sentence without a single vowel : `` str\u010d prst skrz krk . '', 
  literally translated it 's `` put your finger through your throat . '', 
  nice :-d, 
   redditor for 18 days not bad !, 
  but , honestly , are we sure finnish is really a language ? 
   btw : we got you good in hockey yesterday !, 
  are you from indonesia or just not from monaco ? 
   voyaient also 5 vowels in a row are pretty normal !, 
  of course . 
  why do you ask ? 
  they will never stop circlejerking about trianon , so forget about that , 
  how is moving with your family to a wealthier country `` not caring for your family '' ? 
  just asking ... 
  is it * that * shocking ? 
  you 're alredy the very close 3nd largest in europe ( 64 mil , vs. france 66 ) , and the largest - germany - has one of the lowest birth rates on the planet . 
  and 45 years is a * long * time . 
  well , argentina is pretty much on the edge . 
  it 's richer than some oecd countries ( chile , turkey , mexico ) which are considered the rich-countries club . 
  and notice when someone in an american film needs to escape to south america , more often than not they say they 'll go to argentina . 
  that does n't mean you can compare them to african colonies . 
  and argentina is 55th richest nation out of over 200 . 
  that 's pretty rich . 
  argentina is the richest south american country ( gdp ppp per capita ) . 
  how could you let them get so far ? 
  you ca n't ever compare colonies like the us , canada and australia that have been settled almost completely by people coming from europe , and colonies in africa , where no such large migration happened , the europeans just subjugated the local populations for a while . 
  thankfully the ai never passes enough hre resolutions . 
  we can never know for sure though . 
  i do n't think so . 
  yes , much of the wehrmacht was tied down elsewhere , and yes , germany would never defeat russia in russia . 
  but i believe they would be able to stop the russians on german soil . 
  they would pull all troops from elsewhere and concentrate them on the defense . 
  berlin would not be taken . 
  absolutely . 
  us needed uk , and uk needed us . 
  but without us , uk and its dominion would n't be able to invade the continent , and therefore hitler could have used all his forces against the might of the ussr . 
  i 'm not sure who would win , but i think russians would never get to berlin . 
  i 'm not american as you seem to suggest . 
  and the uk did take pat in the invasion , but it simply could n't do it on it 's own without the us . 
  well i obviously did n't get what part you were disagreeing with , because you persisted in your passive aggressiveness . 
  if you consider the italian and western fronts to be `` insignificant '' , i guess one of us read comics instead of history books . 
  why must you be so passive aggressive ? 
  if you think i 'm wrong , what 's your comment on [ cash and carry ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cash_and_carry_%28world_war_ii%29 ) for instance ? 
  and what about [ destroyers for bases ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/destroyers_for_bases_agreement ) ? 
  and [ lend-lease ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lend-lease ) ? 
  i 'm not writing them off , i 'm simply saying you would n't be able to mount an invasion of the continent . 
  if you think you could , you 're very misinformed in my opinion . 
  no offense to you scots , but the only western allies by that point i can think of is the uk . 
  and the uk had absolutely no chance of invading the continent on its own . 
  your power was in the navy , your army was always too small in comparison to the continental powers . 
  even if it was probably the most experienced army at the time , the numbers just were n't there . 
  to illustrate , here 's a quote from bismarck that humorously illustrates the disparity :  if the british army landed in europe , i 'd get the belgian police to arrest them . 
  what do you mean ? 
  he is right , usa has been propping up the uk well before december 7th , 1941 . 
  we ca n't be sure about that . 
  i think the germans could have very well withstood the russians on the eastern front if the us did not enter the european theatre . 
  from my flair you can guess i 'm pretty aware of what went down in czechoslovakia . 
  i 'm pointing out his comment is n't really well made . 
  honestly , we were pretty happy when they did that . 
  though that was in 1945 . 
  it would be truly disastrous for the south , absolutely .

  baltic tribes lasted the longest ( they are related to slavs but they are not slavs ) . 
  they were converted often forcibly . 
  there have been number of crusades against them and it was also the reason why teutonic order ( german catholic warriors ) established itself in prussia . 
  prussia itself was the homeland of old prussians - indigenous pagan baltic tribe , which was wiped out and remnants were assimilated . 
  what about [ goat heads ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/svi%c3%b0#/media/file:svi%c3%b0.jpg ) ? 
  lucky bastards, 
  and chips ? 
  actually , the last pagan area was in baltic region ( mainly lithuania area ) till 14th century, 
  volcanoes , geysers , icebergs , icelandic ponies , sagas , bj\u00f6rk , sigur r\u00f3s , reykjavik , hungry banks , they eat rotten sharks , their surnames contain suffix * d\u00f3ttir * for women and * son * for men, 
   catholicism is basically non-existent here . 
  lithuania is known as the most religious from the baltics . 
  also , homophobia is widespread there . 
  rape ? 
  rape is everywhere as well as violence against women . 
  was n't in russia recently , that they softened the law in regards to domestic violence ? 
  russians are mostly middle class leaving russia due to security reasons and searching for better prospects for their kids . 
  they relocate their families here while many still work in russia or have still income from there . 
  also , they try to secure their wealth so they invest in properties , companies etc here , cos they know they could potentionally lose it all in russia ( political and economical instability ) . 
  czechia is basically their back up plan in case russia would go down the drain . 
  oh , the time when millions of european elves sailed to americas, 
  if it would be a `` joke '' said by some pub redneck with limited intellect , i would just say : whatever , he 's dumb . 
  but , when it 's said by the head of the state , that 's quite alarming, 
  when have you have n't been embarrassed because of him ? 
  you 're welcome and congratulation !, 
  great voice, 
  she is said to have the longest legs in eurovision and she hides them behind the ugly skirt,

  the song i listen over and over is from bulgaria . 
  the performer i watch over and over is from israel . 
  she liked to have a lot of children and then use them in the marriage policy . 
  she was cold to them but had favorite one m. christina . 
  it got to r/all, 
  check if it 's diamond, 
  she is strong viking woman, 
  israel is hot, 
  bulgaria was great, 
  actually , it would be [ gaulish ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gaulish_language ) in the case of france . 
  yes , area of austria , bohemia , bavaria , switzerland and eastern france was the celtic homeland - the [ hallstatt culture ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hallstatt_culture ), 
  venedae/wends is another name for slavic people . 
  it 's historical name for slavs living near germanic settlement areas . 
  we 're celtic here . 
  boii the best tribe !, 
  coal stronk in polan, 
  they let women vote in 1971 and one canton as late as 1991 and only thanks to supreme court . 
  switzerland is pretty conservative country . 
  every czech media i have read i.e. 
  this is the official police estimate, 
  the thing i like the most is the humor czechs use when protesting . 
  it 's about ex-communists turned capitalists and oligarchs who influence our politics . 
  it 's not only about babi\u0161 and zeman but also about kellner , k\u0159et\u00ednsk\u00fd etc. 
  the relation with russia is in the way that this is the new normal in russia and we do n't want the power of oligarchs and politicians protecting them here . 
  there was rumor , that we could get [ kladsko ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/k%c5%82odzko_land ) back . 
  poland wanted to exchange it for the whole [ teschen ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cieszyn_silesia ) region , but this was unacceptable for the czech side . 
  since we have been with austria , we lost our territories cos austrians do n't know how to win a war, 
  armenia is really good, 
  i 'm ready to be his queen, 
  high culture , fashion houses and couture , paris , lyon , great cuisine , provence , strong pharmaceutical and beauty industries , love-hate relationship with england , former colonial power , french are socially conscious and they have strong labour unions , very diverse countryside from alps and mediterranean to the north sea and atlantic, 
  all sides did the same : germans , allies , soviets , japanese ... 
  it 's disgusting . 
  men took women as trophies and they wanted to humiliate them . 
  war release the worst human traits . 
  we celebrate the innocent who helped to free much of europe from the nazi death avalanche . 
  we might not agree with soviet union and its political aims , but we remember the ordinary who fought for their lives , their families , for the idea of europe without nazis and to end the bloody war . 
  like hitler would leave them alone, 
  are they talking about putin ? 
  they just had nazi uniforms and fought for them in a war, 
  well it was liberation from the eminent enemy , what came later is another story, 
  both are right . 
  you are right with the historically correct dates , but today 's date is the one chosen officially as celebration of liberation from fascism and it 's bank holiday . 
  nah , so far there are baltic flags trying to make excuses of their nazi past, 
  true , but in that time , people were not thinking this way . 
  there was no army , civilians and partisans fought against professional nazi soldiers . 
  snipers were shooting people on the streets , nazis killed 7000 people there in four days . 
  those ss estonian soldiers marched to prague to help nazi slaughter of civilians . 
  so when they were caught by partisans , they were seen as eminent death threat . 
  sad in today 's perspective , but those soldiers were in a bad place and bad time . 
  so you see , ethnic slovaks were killed during nazism in masse as well ( not only slovak jews and roma ), 
  yes , but it was during prague uprising . 
  nazis were killing people in the streets , so there was a little mercy when nazis were caught . 
  what ? 
  slovakia was fascist , but it also lost thousands in fight with nazism i.e. 
  slovak national uprising . 
  it get a bit weird with baltics regarding wwii topics . 
  they seem to be glorifying their nazi past sometimes . 
  they should keep in mind that nazis are evil numb . 
  one in much of europe and that most countries have horrific experience with them . 
  they were ss soldiers , so i guess they were not communists or anti-fascists, 
  sad , but they were our enemy at the time . 
  ss troops were not really welcomed here , does n't matter german , estonian , slovak ... 
  thousands of churches and in few of them are masses ( 3k masses but in the same churches ), 
  churches are maintained , but mostly as a cultural heritage . 
  few have regular masses , except christmas midnight mass . 
  yeah , but 13 % is really low in the european context . 
  the number is going to drop even more since most believers are from the old generation . 
  welcome in telenovela,

   if woman will be forced to stop working or to incur additional costs there are costs that are hard to quantify , however . 
  what if the woman looses a promotion or any other career opportunity because of the pregnancy . 
  i mean , who in their right mind would want to give a managerial position to a person who would soon be forced to stop working , and for a relatively long time ? 
  it is , in any case , a bit besides the point to your question , i believe . 
  if i 'm not wrong , a woman is under no obligation to identify the father of her child . 
  she can choose to raise the child by herself . 
  but you seem to be suggesting that a pregnant woman would have to identify the father before being allowed to have an abortion . 
  i believe that 's ridiculous . 
  it 's a law that would be nearly impossible to enforce , would be unfair , and would only result in unnecessary complications for a woman who chooses to interrupt her pregnancy . 
  i honestly do n't know if the czech family code has that provision , but i meant something beyond just sending money as if it was another bill . 
  regardless , if the father was given the right to have a say about whether the woman must keep the baby before the 12th week , then he should be obliged to look after the mother from that moment on . 
  that argument would have a chance of making sense if the law imposed the man the obligation to look after the woman during pregnancy , especially if it is considered a risk pregnancy , or at least during the last stages . 
  chances are , however , that no such law will never exist , and , if the man so chooses , the woman will have to be the one bearing alone the whole burden of the pregnancy . 
  there are other things to consider , though . 
  what if the woman claims not to remember who the father might be ? 
  or claims that it was someone she banged during her holidays in italy ? 
  how can that be possibly disproved ( if the real father does n't even know she got knocked up to begin with ) ? 
  is it unfair ? 
  well , some people might say so . 
  but there are also people who 'll tell you it is unfair that a man be mandated to support until adulthood a child conceived during a drunken one night stand . 
  ah , that is not likely to raise any shitstorm whatsoever . 
  `` we have this bog-standard product , with a well-known brand , and all . 
  we need to think up something new because sales are n't what they used to be . 
  any ideas ? '', 
  `` yeah . 
  let 's rebrand it as a premium one !, 
  people 'll go crazy over it ! '', 
  it defies logic , really . 
  `` censorship '' . 
  that word gets thrown around too liberally . 
  last time i 've checked , fb was a service provider and not part of the public administration or a public authority . 
  as such , they are free to set any policies they see fit with regards to what they will allow to be displayed through their service ; always within the law . 
  as stupid as i think fb 's ban of that photo in particular , and other similar ones is , i do n't see anything reproachable in it . 
  but hey , fb bashing seems to be all the rage now , and a good tool to distract the attention from other , really serious matters . 
  it 's missing `` cervoise '' in french , a type of unhopped ale that is hardly made any more . 
  why not both ? 
   someone with gun could really act in selfdefence and shot those brainless figures . 
  that would 've been really lovely . 
  in other news , water is wet, 
  anyone willing to go and worship into those fugly , scary buildings has to be very pious and deserves respect . 
  everyone else is a closeted atheist , good for them . 
  this world is n't such a shithole after all . 
  because they use higher pressure with the dispensing gas , just like you can do with a normal tap . 
  the rats are abandoning ship ? 
  business as usual in eastern europe , it seems . 
  this is a good example why i believe referendums are hardly ever a good idea . 
  many people will use them as a form of protest against the government , without pondering too much about the question , and certain politicians will naturally try profit from it . 
  in any case , it 'll be interesting how things develop from now on . 
  the referendum is non-binding and parliament can ignore it , if they so choose . 
  given that many in the leave camp are calling for art . 
  50 not to be rushed , i guess they 'll be relieved if that happens : they got the attention they wanted , after all . 
  when was the last time a populist far right party missed an opportunity for some good-ol ' attention whoring ? 
  just about never . 
  move on , nothing new . 
  i 'm only waiting for our twats to come up with some shit like this . 
  okamura , are you there ? 
  i might be weird , but i 've had many of those things , and they are delicious , and what i have n't tasted , sounds so . 
  that would be so utterly stupid and incompetent a decision that it 's really embarrassing to know they are even considering it . 
  lately , i 've been getting the impression that most , if not all , proposals of the eu parliament should be rejected . 
  thanks !, 
  the difference is less than i thought , but still not a small amount . 
  is there a map of median wage ? 
  because for what i 've heard , the czech figure is quite distorted . 
  i like the `` legend '' in there . 
  czech dubbing is really good . 
  they usually hire well-known and respected actors , who will often be the `` czech voice '' of a foreign actor , regardless of what he or she is playing . 
  in some cases , i would go as far as to say that the acting of the dubbing actor is better than the original one . 
  is that time of the year again ? 
  does that include stella artois and jupiler ? 
  the thing is that if the people in the country actually do n't want that , then there 's nothing to be worried about . 
  really , i do n't like drinks like coke , etc. , i think they are shit , and i refuse to buy my daughter any of it , and yet i believe it is a really silly piece of legislation , the sole purpose of which is to make some legislators feel better about themselves . 
  some corn syrup with one meal is healthier than 2 litres of wine . 
  right ? 
  i 'm beginning to suspect that these people are just trolls making shit up to see how far they can push it before everyone looses their shit . 
  could the best course of action be to ignore them , at least publicly ? 
  including the troll in chief . 
  - there 's the perception that the eu has grown into this huge beaurocracy that issues pointless , and byzantine , regulations for no other apparent reason than keeping those bureaucrats busy ; the fact that many of those regulations often seem to disregard local customs for the sake of uniformity , does n't help either . 
  ( i 'm not saying i agree with that , but it is what many people think ) . 
  - few people know , or are interested in knowing , what the purpose of the eu parliament is . 
  on top of that , the media often reports on half baked proposals by obscure meps almost as if the were constitutional amendments . 
  - local governments love to blame the eu ( the dictates from brussels , as they call them here ) for any hamfisted policy they should n't even have considered in the first place ; all while gladly grabbing those eu structural funds.the refugee situation has , of course , served to aggravate things further . 
  hmmm ... smallpox . 
  it gives it such depth of flavour !, 
  i see your dinosaur bites , and i raise you [ couple with stimulants and bread ] ( https://i.imgur.com/nrzoicp.jpg ) from a czech menu . 
  that would still leave close to 9 million eur to be paid , the amount the fn is now being asked to pay by that russian bank . 
  could it be that french banks were already aware of that ? 
  in any case , are the banks doing anything illegal here ? 
  it does n't seem to be the case , whatever their reasons are . 
  are they doing something immoral or unethical ? 
  that would depend on the true reasons they are refusing to lend the money , and we do n't really know them , do we ? 
  assuming the polls are correct , and she gets ( according to the most conservative figures ) 25 % of the vote and goes to a second round , as expected . 
  how much would she be getting back ? 
  correct me if i 'm wrong , but do n't parties get refunded up to 50 % of the expenses of the campaign ? 
  if so , and if the 27 million figure that was being mentioned a few days ago is true , that would leave over 13 million eur , plus interests . 
  do we know if fn would be able to return that much money ? 
  have we seen their accounts ? 
  i do n't see the banks as deciding who gets to run for president . 
  it is evident le pen is running for president . 
  they are only choosing not to finance her campaign , and it seems to be their legal right to do so . 
  the best solution in the case would to not allow political parties to finance their campaigns with bank loans , so everybody would playing on a level field as far as that goes .

  most of those who asked about it did n't qualify ( ancestor left germany but was not prosecuted in any way , no documents available , ancestor left too early etc. ), 
   i assume that one would need to have useful skills to move - but why is only speaking english such a bad thing ? 
  because when you move to europe , outside of uk , ireland and malta , the official language is not english . 
  you might find a job in an international company where the office language is english , but outside work , you 're on your own . 
  your neighbors , cashier , authorities ... they 'll speak the local language . 
  not to mention , locals often speak english pretty well too ( just look at this sub ) so you 'll have a disadvantage in the recruitment process . 
   are there any eu countries that do n't have this requirement ? 
  it 's actually not a requirement anywhere in the eu . 
  if you get through the paperwork and communication ( you can google translate and take interpreters with as much as you want ) , no one will stop you from living here , and there certainly are foreigners who do n't speak local languages . 
  i 'm a mod over at / r/iwantout and there 's certainly a lot of americans asking about it . 
  however , most of them are completely unprepared , unqualified , ca n't speak anything but english . 
  it 's not realistic for most americans to just move to europe , you have to have something to offer if you want to move countries . 
  however , i know one american here in germany who moved here when w. bush took office . 
  his justification was that the country was going down the shitter and he did n't want to be a part of it . 
  i feel so bad for estonia :( they all seem so nice and they 've worked so hard to get out of the post-socialist bullshit and you guys do n't want them in the imaginary club . 
  if you 've seen posts from op on this sub , you know that 's exactly what he 's expecting . 
  as an immigrant myself , i ca n't fucking stand those people who move to a new country and immediately * have to * start throwing dirt at their old one . 
  have some dignity , man . 
  netherlands are pretty awesome , tell your old man he does n't have to hate his old country to love his new one . 
  what a bunch of nonsense . 
  center-right does exactly as populist decisions as center-left to stay in power , muslim minorities are not some miraculous voting power that keeps parties in power . 
  we have democracy , anyone can vote for whoever they like . 
   europeans , what do you think of the uk at the moment ? 
  '' * things used to be better . 
  seconded . 
  moreover , every possible question about trump and the election has already been asked and most of the ops are just shitposting anyway . 
  i 'm not saying you are , but the amount of people who come here , ask a ridiculous question and once they got answers call people 's mothers whores is too fucking high . 
  also this guy the other day wanted to nuke america . 
  he was himself american . 
   so just remember , when someone asks stupid questions , it 's legit curiosity and the lack of prior learning . 
  or ignorance .

  asylum seekers , wtf ? 
  asylum on what grounds ? 
  they do n't get paid enough in unemployment support in cz ? 
  life in albania and macedonia ai n't great . 
  gdp is low , job and education opportunities limited , people are poor . 
  society is by european standards strict and repressive .

  not to rain on your parade , but i live in germany . 
  you can write notes for your delivery guy either directly in amazon , or in adresszusatz . 
  it happened to me twice out of 200 + deliveries that the delivery guy took it back to the post . 
  when you 're not home in cz and a parcel arrives , the postman cheerfully takes it to store it in local post office . 
  then you have to wait a 30-60 minutes waiting queue of other poor fucks like yourself to pick it up . 
  now in germany , when you 're not home , the delivery person can leave it at your neighbors ' , and you can pick it up from them . 
  fucking brilliant !, 
  for sure , and if you get lucky , it 's faster * and * cheaper . 
  i used to fly prague -  k\u00f6ln every month with germanwings , glad i did n't have to suffer on a bus or train . 
  op 'll have to do some research , luckily there are these connection search engines on the internet that make it a cakewalk . 
  none of the cities are extremely expensive , that being said they 're all tourist destinations in western europe . 
  wo n't be cheap . 
  your problem is that you picked destinations far away from each other , you 'll have to pay to get from a to b somehow . 
  of course you 'll pay more * berlin * - * florence * than * berlin * - * prague * - * vienna * . 
  '' * intercontinental flight * '' , '' * eurotrip in western europe * '' and '' * cheap * '' do n't really fit into one sentence , guy . 
  i 'd ditch the idea of flying between the cities , take a train ( more convenient ) or a bus ( cheaper ) . 
  logical order would be amsterdam - berlin - florence - barcelona . 
  i 'd welcome it , if it was operating as a defense force in east and south of europe . 
  stress on defense force . 
  i think i speak for many countries when i say - we just want to be left alone , we do n't want more territory , we do n't care about destabilizing some regions , claiming natural resources , shit like that . 
  i 'd like a deterrent army . 
  including the '' * fucking piece of shit europeans why do you cunts hate america ?

  i look up to slovenia as hard workers who got out of the post-communist shit really well , has * beautiful * nature , nice people . 
  however also some of the worst shitposters in this sub are incidentally slovenian :d, 
   cheaper is always better  ...  right now we were looking at munich munich is expensive af , op . 
  generally look east and look south . 
  i recommend croatia , slovenia , bulgaria , romania .

  awesome experience , genuine people . 
   and i 'm able to pay with the euro tfw bulgaria , croatia , czech republic , denmark , hungary , poland , romania , sweden and uk are not european :(,

  pay attention / u/kernedsansserif - if you come on tourist visa , earning any money at all is illegal and will earn you kick out of schengen . 
  if you want to work , either work visa ( unlikely in your situation ) or working holiday visa ( depending where you come from ), 
  in smaller towns , barely ever , because the local left scene has very small presence ( while nazis from all over the country came to demonstrate there ) . 
  in cities , almost always . 
  that 's why the cops walk with them , so that they can prevent violent skirmishes . 
  the question is if op meant east europe as in east from germany , or east as in romania , bulgaria , ukraine etc. 
  because life in visegrad 4 countries for example has been pretty good lately , barely any people ever leave . 
   did they march in cities , like a parade ? 
  yeah . 
  legally any demonstration is required to be announced in advance . 
  so they 'd apply for the right to demonstrate somewhere , then they 'd go there , grab some flags and signs , and then they 'd just walk through the city/town . 
  from what i know , these marches are usually in complete silence , they 're very well aware that shouting some of their ideas in public or doing the hitler salute would get them arrested . 
  we had a common friend . 
  he was a car mechanic living in a rather poor neighborhood in prague . 
  at first i thought he 's one of those wannabe tough guys , shaved head and bomber jacket , but as i met him more often , he said he would regularly go to nazi marches around the republic .

  the pain of sancions will lessen as time goes on , but russia 's economic capacity will suffer forever long they last . 
  just look at the last period that russia had to be self-sufficient - the ussr was plagued with poor materials , substandard quality , diminished efficiency and all because there was zero competition . 
  it eventually led to the collapse of the entire regime . 
  their local economy will strengthen , but that emans nothing if they want to grow and take their place among the other world economies . 
  and thats exactly the point . 
  a poor country ca n't feild a large military and these sanctions will eventually put enormous strains on military structures and installations , especially in r&d and maintenance ,, 
  well , they have to feed off of something . 
  auto-cannibalism is not pretty, 
  you agree with the above point and then say it does n't exist ? 
  ok , whatever you say . 
  and assuming the holocaust was only about the jews is insulting in itself . 
  romanis , gays , czechs , poles , russians and socialists were all targeted and make up the bulk of the dead . 
  they are part of the holocaust as well . 
  so creating a legal framework to protect the truth of a massive atrocity from being forgotten should do just that : protect the massive numbers of peoples killed for no reason other than that their governments viewed them as vermin . 
  so saying only the holocaust deserves protection and only on the basis of anti-semitism is insulting to all the millions of others who suffered the same fate and paradoxically does the exact opposite since by excluding obvious genocides fro those protections , it gives deniers ammunition to say `` see , genocide is a relative term ! '' . 
  and by allowing the denial of communist and soviet atrocities , we give enduring legitimacy to those regimes while at the same time that making sure in the same exact situation the fascistic regime of nazi germany would not have this ability . 
  it is cherrypicking at its most basic and gives credence to those who pine for a restoration of the soviet union . 
   stands uniquely in history . 
  please , structured organized killings of entire populations based on class and religion have existed throughout history . 
  just look at chinese dynastic changes and the bloodbaths that followed them , or the eradication of native americans via slave labour . 
  giving the holocaust a unique position sole based on the fact that it happened so recently and in the civilized world is insulting to everyone else who suffered under the same general circumstances . 
  exactly , it willfully tries to evade the definitions that would necessitate the inclusion of these crimes in the same legal framework ; all on the position that we need to maintain good relations with the nation perpetrators . 
  in that case why have a law that prohibits denial of certain atrocities at all , if you 're going to be decide what an atrocity is based on ideological and current political situations rather than justice and human rights ? 
   either you 're making things up , we 're reading a different article , or i 'm blind . 
  from the article : `` for all the terrible crimes of the ussr , you ca n't compare the people who built auschwitz with the people who liberated it . 
  nazi germany would probably not have been defeated if it were n't for russia . '', 
  this paragraph in its entirety implies that we should hold russia to a lower standard of human rights protections all based on the fact of its role in ending the second world war and our supposed debt to the nation . 
   who says they ca n't be ? 
  the article , by its implications that good things cancel out the bad things countries have done . 
  since the allies won the war and kept the fascist menace at bay , they should deserve a free pass for time immemorial . 
  and by allowing the denial of those atrocities it belittles the horrors . 
  your argument is better suited to the revocation of the law in totality . 
  why should the holocaust genocide be given special position in the legal system ? 
  is not all human life equal ? 
   yes , many ukrainians died . 
  but stalin never attempted to kill them all . 
  what do you think the point of the holocaust was ? 
  oh wow , so by that logic the horrors the japanese did to the chinese was relatively more acceptable because they did n't intend to exterminate them all ? 
  do you hear yourself ? 
  by refusing to call it what it is , a genocide , it does erase the gravity of the crimes . 
  if someone plans a murder and executes it , but then goes around saying to was an accident , or self defense , then the gravity of the crime is lessened . 
  you 're essentially advocating for holocaust denial aswell with that sentiment , as the revisionists insist the holocaust too was not a genocide , thereby removing gravity and erasing the experiences of these groups of people . 
   they can be call out . 
  the problem is making the crimes equivalent to the holocaust . 
  and the main reason for them not calling it a genocide was explicitly mentioned as to not anger the country who perpetrated the crimes . 
  not to mention the secondary argument that any genocide = scope of holocaust , which is a fallacy as well . 
  genocides do n't have to mean that  6m people died , it simply means that a large group of people was killed on the basis on a few uncontrollable traits , such as class , education , ethnicity or sexual orientation . 
  which most certainly was the case here with the polish intelligentsia , ukrainians altays and baltic peoples . 
   efraim zuroff , the nazi-hunter and director of the simon wiesenthal centre 's israel office , describes the effort by the six eastern states as a `` false symmetry '' . 
  `` we have no problem with a day of commemoration for communist crimes , and indeed , something should be done , but the holocaust was a unique tragedy in history , '' he said . 
  `` for all the terrible crimes of the ussr , you ca n't compare the people who built auschwitz with the people who liberated it . 
  nazi germany would probably not have been defeated if it were n't for russia . '', 
  the article posits that comparing the genocides caused by the soviets to the holocaust belittles the scope of the holocaust , thereby de facto making it a form of holocaust denial . 
  this is inflammatory if not just for the reason that it erases the tortue and mass murder of many civilians for things beyond their control , just as was done to the various minorities during ww2 , but the article then has the gall to rationalize its position by stating that deeming them genocides would anger russia , validating the prioritization political capital over human rights and justice . 
  furthermore , if an allied power ca n't be called out for their mistreatment of so many innocents , then what right does europe have in sticking their nose in any of the human rights violations that have since happened in the world or calling then out . 
  should we gloss over the japanese internment camps ? 
  how can we be critical of north korea , if it was defacto one under the ussr ? 
  and how can we possibly view france 's brutal slave trade in haiti critically ? 
  the current flag derives from the flag of bohemia ( white and red ) which was identical to poland 's flag but predated it by a couple of centuries . 
  the colours ( like poland 's ) were based off the national coat of arms ; white for the silver of the bohemian lion and red for the red background . 
  when czechoslovakia formed , we needed a new flag since the traditional red-white flag was in use by poland since 1831 , and slovakia wanted representation on the national flag . 
  a blue isosceles triangle was then added , done so that the flag would not fall into the traditional scheme of striped panslavic flags ( like serbia , slovenia , croatia etc ) since russia was using panslavism as its jingoistic foreign policy ( which culminated in the first world war ) . 
  when the country split up in the velvet divorce , czechia kept the original federal icons and the blue triangle came to represent moravia . 
  if france is raising the age rating , you know it has to be seriously hard-core . 
  ah yes , `` and you are lynching negroes '' . 
  czechoslovakia was a unified centralized state until it became federalized in 1969 . 
  as such , only one flag could be applied before then . 
  the map is still anachronistic though , since yugoslavia and ndr were never concurrently in the eastern bloc sphere . 
  i live in the historic part of prague , so every hour from 6 am i get 3 sets of bells ringing : the nun 's hospital , the large monastery on the top of the hill , and then a god damn serenade from the loreta .

  um , the short name for our country in czech is \u010cesko not \u010cesk\u00e1 republika . 
  and the same goes for english , with czechia . 
  funny that they accurately do slovakia though . 
  no they did not . 
  google has its chinese domain censored , but you can just as easily find the censored articles and websites from google sites that are not registered in china , like google.com or google.co.uk . 
  oh my god , those comments . 
  i should hope these people never venture from their homes . 
  speaking a language , even as a first language , does not equal ethnicity . 
  the graph declares 6 million czech people when in reality there are at least 10 million speakers . 
  this is because the census takers did n't associate their language with their ethnicity . 
  the same is applicable to the austrian statistic , who are missing about at least 2 million speakers . 
  and before the 2012 elections they had [ 5.4 % and 3.7 % ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/communist_party_of_ukraine ) in 2006 and 2007 . 
  obvious editorialization is obvious . 
  they technically do . 
  their independence day is june 12 , 1990 when the congress of people 's deputies of the rsfsr adopted a declaration of sovereignty from the ussr . 
  boris yeltsin then resigned from the communist part at the 28th congress . 
  it is not possible for presumed transsexual individuals to choose not to undergo surgery - if they are approved for sex reassignment , they are expected to undergo treatment immediately . 
  those who wish to remain `` non-operative '' ( as well as those who cross-dress and/or identify as genderqueer ) are considered their biological gender , and as such they are likely to face harassment as being homosexuals and subject to the same laws barring homosexual acts . 
  just because transgenders can get sex reassignment surgery , does not mean the government is forthcoming . 
  many transgenders do not wish to undergo the reassignment surgery , and to assume that they do as you do is just as ignorant as your comment saying that gays are fine to go to iran as long as they suppress an important part of what makes them human . 
  iran is not a democratic society and as such people are not free to express themselves there . 
  ignorant of the plethora of individual european cultures and their complexities . 
  not to mention history on the whole and a myopic perspective on current events , 
  and no one considers wales an actual country . 
  current public ignorance does n't overshadow historical fact . 
  most amusing is the fact that greece belongs to neither side .

   sauna evenings at my flat how big is your flat , and are there any problems with mold or ventilation ? 
  more like passing out and being slowly cooked at medium heat . 
  drinking and sauna doesnt sounds safe .

  we are shitty to them , but we treat them equally to czechs . 
  no discrimination . 
  how about macedonia ? 
  they need to close their borders first - and they will need a lot of outside help , because they dont have enough resources for this . 
  spanish gdp is growing nicely , industrial production is growing , employment is finally growing too . 
  it just needs more time . 
  improvements dont come overnight . 
  this is idiotic . 
  we must stop this immigration at turkish/greek/bulgarian border . 
  zeman is an embarassment , a russian puppet that we gladly voted in . 
  shame on us czechs . 
  regarding treatment of refugees , there are certainly things that we can do better . 
  we still dont have enough facilities , translators , finances and experience with mass illegal immigration . 
  if we treat the illegal migrants , that refuse to ask for asylum in our country , rather harsh , we will be critized . 
  but it works to deter them and they will use austria to go to germany instead of our country . 
  we woul be a dirty doormat for them anyway , none wants to stay here . 
  if we would treat them in velvet gloves , we will get pat on our shoulder . 
  but at the same time , germany will get upset that we allow them to pass to them and close our western border . 
  our small economy is very export-oriented and we cant afford closed borders with germany . 
  this situation has no nice solution . 
  correct . 
  when you go bancrupt , you basically tell your creditors they can f * ck off . 
  most vietnamese in czechia still havent obtained czech citizenship , this goes also for their children born here . 
  our country is very restrictive about who can get it . 
  majority of those vietnamese drug producers and dealers can be deported , if we manage to sign a deal with vietnam . 
  here , germany has more leverage to push for such a deal on our behalf . 
  i still dont understand why we dont issue more work visa for ukrainians . 
  we need more workforce . 
  while hardworking ukrainians need jobs and are willing to come here . 
  match made in heaven . 
  and ? 
  if i wanted to go to canada and on my way there went through the usa illegally without visa , what do you think would happen ? 
  would i not be detained and deported ? 
  we dont do whatever we want . 
  there are valid czech laws that must be obeyed . 
  if there are shortcommings , our state should do its best to correct them . 
  acute shortage of translators is understandable . 
  there are very few licensed translators for mena languages in our country and nobody wants to work for immigration office ( shitty pay , far away places , danger ) . 
  shortage of some basic neccessities is not nice , but when you get unannounced hundert people in one night , it can happen on the first day . 
  also , under-financed asylum centers is pretty normal occurence . 
  they get a room , food , clothes , tv and some other neccessities . 
  but no luxuries . 
  lack of hygiene is their own fault , many of them refuse to clean their own places . 
  and all those that refuse to ask for asylum are deported within 7 days . 
  only those that should under dublin be deported to hungary and greece stay for 40 days . 
  because both countries refuse to accept them back . 
  not our fault . 
  btw , those illegals that ask for asylum in our country are not detained and deported . 
  they are placed in centers where they can come and leave any moment . 
  they get help with education , job , flat and integration . 
  sorry , but that is probably bullshit . 
  it had nothing to do with leftism or whatever . 
  i speak german ( with heavy accent ) and if i should judge them they were rather right leaning if anything ( btw all my bad experience was with men , why are german men so nasty and hatefull ?

  there are engaged groups that maintain `` pure '' traditional music , dance and old habits , especially in southern moravia . 
  but only a tiny percentage of our population takes part in it . 
  local traditions evolve with time , some vanish , some stay popular among general population . 
  like meeting of whole village around huge fire on mountaintop on `` witch-burning night '' , egg-painting and woman-whipping on easter monday or masked groups on st.nicolaus day . 
  all of these traditions are still very vivid in my town near prague . 
  considering music , the most economically successfull local music band of last decade is \u010cechomor , they mostly play centuries old folk songs in new arrangements . 
  their concerts are packed .

  actually , i think there are such people . 
  i ve read a survey some time ago , that among czech teenagers , it is more accepted by peers to be gay then to be religious . 
  so most kids who believe in god stay silent about it , in order not to be ostracized/been made fun . 
  i think it depends on location , some got it better or worse . 
  my fathers family comes from an ethnic moravian village in northern hungary , near danube . 
  it is a very diverse region with german , italian , polish , serbian , czech etc. 
  villages . 
  when ottomans/turks conquered the land , there was ressistence from the original inhabitants ( slovaks and hungarians i guess ) . 
  turks got fed up and after killing most men in fights , they started to hunt and kill females and children and burn down villages . 
  all remaining inhabitants from many villages in that area ran into near wooded mountains and hid in cave system .

  he perceives internal terrorism as more serious problem . 
  initially the terror will be practiced by sleeper cells of islamists , the next phase will be radicalised second and third generation of immigrants which will be countered by right-wing and nationalist extremists . 
  at least in one place municipality provided them access for free . 
  also not paying at all is viable option - what can one lifeguard do with an aggressive group ? 
  leo express operates 5 trains on the most lucrative route in the country . 
  they are in ( higher than expected ) loss . 
  state railways operate about thousand of trains . 
  should they follow leo the country would be bankrupt .

  out of those 2,501 ( 96,7 % ) voted against the refugees , 87 voted to take them in .

  i am not aware of serious polls on this topic but few weeks ago mainstream newspapers asked online whether people would be willing to drop schengen to reduce immigration . 
  about 2/3 agreed , not very suprising result .

  he expects that each country will protect itself independently . 
  he mentions british pm as the first example of such trends .

  during friday czech police detained 136 migrants , probably the record number ever . 
  police moved out 31 women and children from a refugee camp which saw 2 riots in last 2 days . 
  refugees want to go to germany , that 's why they rioted . 
  currently the police operates on level 1 of border protection , with semirandom checks here and there . 
  minister of interior will propose to lift it up to level 2 , meaning more border checks ( he will also asks for more money ) . 
  level 3 would mean employing the army , this was not yet proposed but the newspaper thinks it may happen .

  about hundred of refugees started to demolish the camp after he left . 
  refugees are very angry because they ended up in piss poor eastern european country instead of german/scandinavian paradise .

  in the czech republic one just selects category `` for protection '' . 
  no need to explain anything or to prove whatever . 
  actually , these categories are formal anyway , when you obtain permit for any reason ( e.g. 
  sport shooting ) you can carry the gun for self protection as everyone else . 
  in the czech republic foreigners generally can not legally bring in their weapons . 
  there are some exception : sport shooting , hunting , eu nationals with eu-wide permit .

  do you have some numbers ? 
  milk/cheese/etc is usually not that hard to produce . 
  austrian corps ( allied with napoleon ) had 30k men . 
  almost 20k managed to return back from the war .

  generally there 's no problem with it - we got thousands of slovakians anyway , some greeks ( although their migration predates the eu ) , some polish people , but mostly ukrainians ( who do the jobs nobody wants to do ) and russians . 
  most people do n't care , but if you want to be mean to someone , gypsies and vietnamese are an easier target ( although increasingly not so ) , but there is still some resentment towards the russians . 
  as with the social democrats - the ones that are in the government are pro-refugee - on the day of the 17 november , the prime minister met with leaders of pro-refugee organisations ( some of them quite shady people though ) and the cssd minister for human rights runs from taxes a propaganda organisation that pushes a pro-refugee stance ( known as hatefree ) . 
  the lower level cssd politicians are however against it . 
  i would say that it 's about 50-50 - the party is divided on the issue , and the government has been pursuing a very passive position on the whole immigration issue . 
  ( people do n't want it , but the government is too afraid to say it out loud ), 
  i love how they put an irrelevant eu-immigrant info box in the middle of the article to spin the article 's attention away from mena immigrants who actually have the highest tendency to ` misbehave ', 
  that makes it even worse :d, 
  well ... it still largely takes islam for its state religion - people who ` insult ' it or dare to be atheists have a hard time there, 
  well , no wonder if the ` fascists ' are the only ones who can offer sensible policy on the matter ... ( which pisses me off as well , i do n't want to vote for people like orb\u00e1n and zeman just because the rest of the politicians do n't understand basic national interests - it 's a shame that we have to vote for these people , but we have no choice if we want europe to stay europe ),

  it finally makes sense now, 
  all the more reason not to import them in the first place !, 
  yay !, 
  as if it was n't already easy enough for islamists to get to europe . 
  sorry turks , but i doubt the eu will couple this with effective border control and repatriation of immigrants and remove the pull factors of migration . 
  we should n't have to rely on others to protect our borders ( and especially the current not-so-nice turkish government ) , because once we do , we effectively have no borders . 
  `` un high commissioner for human rights recently accused of him fueling xenophobic public discourse thanks to his repeated islamophobic statements . '', 
  - no wonder , when saudi arabia heads the commission . 
  media always kind of forget to mention this . 
  i do n't know really what to think of him . 
  on the one hand , he supports a better position on the issue than our government does ( which is too cowardly to even join the lawsuit against quotas ) , but on the other he did a number of things a president should n't do ( his `` illness '' , pasy , went to china when he should n't have , his rusophillic tendencies etc. ) . 
  however , i think he 'll remain the public 's choice for the following years , since the crisis is the no . 
  1 issue right now and he 's been always on the sceptic side and he knows what to say . 
  so what that he was on stage with an `` extremist '' group . 
  the dangerous inactivity and lack of balls of our government , is imho , much worse than that . 
  ** the czech republic will not join the lawsuit against refugee quotas ** prague -- the czech republic will not join the lawsuit against the redistribution of refugees , how the deputy prime minister andrej babi\u0161 ( ano ) suggested on friday . 
  the government decided to uphold its original position on today 's special meeting -- it will not support the lawsuit . 
  prime minister bohuslav sobotka told the media . 
  according to him , the czech republic would risk losing its position in the eu . 
  \u201e i am pleased to announce that the minister of internal affairs , the directors of all the three intelligence services and the police president have confirmed that we have no contemporary information of any terrorist threat or attack within the czech republic , '' sobotka announced . 
  increased security measures however are still in effect , but because of the worsened situation in france and belgium , not in the czech republic . 
  `` although we should n't underestimate anything , i think that what we need the least is any hysteria , any succumbing to fear , which would lead us to do steps that have no rational reasoning . 
  there is truly no reason for us to cancel traditional events that relate to the fact that christmas is coming , '' said the head of government . 
  should the police have some doubts concerning a particular event , he added , it will of course contact the specific organisers . 
  the discussion about security measures will be continued on the 8th of december by the national security council , which will also concern itself with systemic measures prepared by the ministry of internal affairs and the security information service ( bis ) to guarantee the safety of czech citizens . 
  amongst other things it should be the material system for national security and the material for safety concerning migration . 
  the minister of internal affairs milan chovanec ( \u010cssd ) added that the czech republic does n't have any problems now that would be related to migration nor any returnees from fighting for the islamic state . 
  according to him , the migration crisis in the czech republic peaked in the summer months , in the last weeks the police caught 27 , 14 , and then 10 migrants . 
  the capacity of the detention centres is filled not even to ten percent . 
  there are 136 migrants within them , and 11 of them are in the critised b\u011bl\u00e1 pod bezd\u011bzem . 
  \u201e the czech republic is n't experiencing any migration crisis now , '' said the minister , adding that even in the coming months the number of incoming migrants should n't grow . 
  chovanec was given the mandate to negotiate on behalf of the czech republic at the meeting of the ministers of the eu on migration on 4th of december . 
  the czech republic wants to debate about the effectiveness of hotspots , which do n't function ideally , according to the government . 
  it is still against permanent quotas for redistributing migrants and for increasing the security on the schengen 's outer border . 
  regarding the debate about limiting and tightening of the access to weapons , the government holds the opinion that it is necessary to fight against the illegal weapons market . 
  it does not see any space for tightening the rules concerning legal holders of firearms , since they were severely limited after the tragic shooting in uhersk\u00fd brod .

   people fear them because they have no experience i hate this self-loathing position that immigrant supporters have . 
  people are n't stupid !, 
  there is enough information and statistics out there that shows that this immigration wave 's negatives greatly outweigh its positives , unlike those that we have experience with ( ukrainians , vietnamese ) . 
   people fear them because of media massage what media massage do you speak of ? 
  the mainstream media massage , bias and outright propaganda that 's prevalent now is greatly in favour of this immigration . 
  just read idnes.cz and how they reported of the last demonstration , watch \u010ct , or read respekt . 
  there are hints of some serious pro-immigration bias . 
  we know why we kicked them out of sudetenland ... \\ s on the other hand , had the germans ( at the time bloody right-wingers most of them ) stayed , we probably would n't have descended into communism and towns around the borders would be less shabby and in a much better state than they are now . 
  it will soon be . 
  as things are developing , the bavarians will close the borders and the up until now limited flow of immigrants through southern moravia will be replaced by the main flow from austria to germany . 
  saxony ( east germany is less sympathetic to migrants ) will get fed up quicker than bavaria , close the border , and we 'll end up with thousands of migrants within czech republic with nowhere to go and nobody to stop them ( our border guard and army is nonexistent , our military minister is an actor , our prime minister does n't have guts to initiate anything on his own and maybe start preparing for the situation ... ) . 
  and of course , we hate the quotas even more , since it 's a breach of sovereignty and moving of problems to those who have n't caused them . 
  yeah , as if anyone still respects the deficit rules anyway ( especially the big countries ) . 
  the -- ... chosen one !!, 
  will we get a chance to see the pretty graphs once the survey is over ? 
  we do have people from different cultural regions - or are the vietnamese just passing by ? 
  yeah , surely not as diverse and enriching as arabs or africans , but still quite different than the czech cultural region . 
  yeah , fuck us all , we 're just stupid ignorant czechs who know nothing about the world , who are just vulgar fat alcoholics and who should just shut up and listen to the good guys from the un who know better . 
  we have already been globalised . 
  the immigration that comes in this crisis brings us nothing ( unlike the other estabilished immigrant groups ) apart from that we can pat ourselves on the back what a good job we have done . 
  judging from the cost that western european societies have suffered on their liberty and safety ( and expenditure ) as a result of this immigration , i ( and i believe most czechs also ) think it 's just not worth it . 
  europe should n't be isolationist . 
  however , protecting your borders is n't a sign of isolationism , it is a sign of a working state ( that 's partly why the state is here - to protect the people within it ) . 
  australia , japan , canada , spain protect their borders - these are n't isolationist countries whatsoever . 
  in fact , europe should interest itself more in stabilising its surroundings and in discouraging people from coming by border protection in the short run and investing in their countries more in the long run .

   in the test case from the czech republic , iirc more than half of all roma children in that town were put in schools for the mentally retarded , compared to 3 % of the general population . 
  you ( echr ) suggest that the nasty czech state does everything to keep the poor roma uneducated . 
  the opposite is true . 
  the special schools are for kids who would not be able to cope with standard schooling , for various reasons . 
  light mental retardation is one ( severe cases get handled differently ) , another is aggressivity , lack of any social skills , inability to talk and so on . 
  these kids are typically neglected by their parents and sometimes exposed to alcohol , sniffing glue or violence ( i remember one such case that happened in a * kindergarten * ) . 
  these special schools have teachers prepared to handle such children ( it is called * special pedagogy * and it is separate subject of study at pedagogic universities ) , the classes are much smaller ( say ten kids instead of typical 30 ) , the curriculum can be modified according to situation , kids are not under pressure . 
  these schools are absolutely the best imaginable thing for them . 
  they give them real chance to learn something and no to became mocked outcasts . 
  these schools are now attacked by various `` activists '' for very perverse reason . 
  activists have no interest in children well-being , they wish them to fail consistently and on large scale . 
  more kids failing would generate new eu grants , new positions in state bureaucracy and more regulations . 
  many people will then be able to obtain safe job for life , a dream in current economic situation . 
  echr is acting on information given by such people . 
  if special schools are forced to close down the result will be catastrophe for all . 
  children with problems will have no chance in the demanding environment of traditional school , unless the education level is lowered down significantly . 
  the kids without problems will be slowed down and will be threatened by those who are very aggressive . 
  the teachers wo n't be prepared to deal with the new situation ( being * special pedagogy * teacher is job for a saint , not everyone can do it ) . 
  in the worst case scenario the problematic kids will be ( unofficially ) ignored by desperate schools and authorities and will grow up without any education at all . 
  ( this is what often happens in such situation across the western europe , i hear . ), 
  the czech ( and before czechoslovak ) schooling system was very good . 
  it managed to provide the highest level of literacy to roma among all european countries . 
  ( claim by a former czech pm . ), 
  destroy it and everyone will be much worse .

  they consulted planned trip with an `` expert '' from an oriental institute a she told them that `` majority of such travellers does n't have any problem '' ( technically true ) . 
  they thought that wearing headscarf will be enough not to attract any attention ... 
  many people mention  maffia & nbsp ; after the start of wwi the most important czech anti-austrian group named themselves * maffie * . 
  back then italian maffia was not perceived as bunch of gangsters but more as fighters against oppression . 
  obligatory [ wikipedia link ] ( https://cs.wikipedia.org/wiki/maffie ) ( only in czech language ) . 
  or another example . 
  just today , czech politican v\u00edt b\u00e1rta was arrested by police . 
  he is owner of a security agency and wanted more power and more money . 
  he did the same feat as andrej babi\u0161 mentioned in the article , in 2010 elections . 
  his populist party got 11 % of votes , became part of the government and b\u00e1rta was named minister of transportation . 
  the party however soon broke down in series of crazy scandals . 
  b\u00e1rta was then not sentenced for bribery only because of parliament immunity . 
  to get an idea about the czech politics you may watch [ this ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jyhgeiwl1u ) video . 
  the stupid blonde with atrocious english is actually an actress , t\u00e1\u0148a mal\u00edkov\u00e1 . 
  outside her role she is quite normal . 
  the old man talking with her was minister of foreign affairs for many years and almost became the president of the czech republic . 
  he participated in this video as a part of recent election campaign . 
  berlusconi would mean progress compared to current political scene . 
  it is called [ solutrean hypothesis ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/solutrean_hypothesis ) . 
  the video itself can be seen e.g. 
  the girls speak in english . 
  if anyone is interested there 's dedicated and active reddit thread : / r/abandonedporn . 
  gypsies do integrate into the societies all the time . 
  invariably they stop all contacts with other gypsies and try everything not to be associated with them . 
  for example they may change surname or claim to have south european ancestry . 
  in newspapers you read about those who do not integrate/assimilate . 
  and currently inactive [ strach ] ( http://strach.cz/ ) or long deceased [ beobachter ] ( http://web.archive.org/web/20071114055418/http://www.beobachter.cz/ ) . 
  i 'll give you two examples . 
  did you hear about semtex explosive ? 
  did you hear about a passive `` radar '' which could track stealth planes ? 
  these two technologies were manufactured in [ pardubice ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pardubice ) , a nearby city . 
  the companies were destroyed in early 90 's and former high-tech is no more . 
  tell us about your city , what it is known for , what are you so much proud about . 
   very small it is larger than several european countries . 
  i am serious because i know about few ( nearby ) companies being looted through and through and forced into bankrupcy during the early 90 's . 
  these companies were until then able to compete and export worldwide , they were destroyed because of the botched up voucher privatisation . 
  the map also shows failure of czech economy after 1989 . 
  what was once advanced industrialized country , second after east germany , is now filled with low added value assembly plants . 
  hilly areas and almost whole slovakia were very poor . 
  yes , during lunchtime , for two minutes .

  i 'm sorry but i find this so fucking funny . 
  i 'm currently reading a book called `` jewish girl from toledo '' written by leon feuchtwanger and it 's as if the spanish king finally understood that he really needs to focus on the economy so he decides to bring the jewish people in . 
  this has to be the dumbest thing i 've read in a while . 
  yes , that is his reasoning because there can be no other . 
  klaus used amnesty to close cases that were older than few years and would never get resolved anyway and were only taking lots of money from taxpayers . 
  - he knowingly freed people on trial for corruption . 
  then v\u00e1clav havel should be facing the same accusations as klaus does . 
  he used amnesty on lots of people facing the same accusations . 
  you might not agree with the way he handled things but calling it treason of ones country is just plain stupid . 
  well , that 's convenient because i do n't give a damn about what 99 % of people outside of czech republic think . 
  the only reason why it is embarassing is because i care about our issues . 
  that is all . 
  - and by the way , klaus deserves this  and this is the mentality of some people here i hate . 
  i do n't like someone therefore he deserves to be accused of treason . 
  if you want to use these distastefully loose definions then practically anything could be interpreted as a betrayal of ones country . 
  it 's extremely embarrassing . 
  even if you ca n't stand klaus you must agree , this circlejerk about amnesty got out of hands . 
  opportunistic politicians will do anything to destroy their opposition . 
  situations similar to this have happened before . 
  i can already see that you 're atleast a socialist . 
  i really do n't think you describe communism well . 
  - i 'm not describing communism , if i wanted to describe i would have written much longer comment . 
  i 'm describing the usual view of the young people on it . 
  as already hinted most marxists today agree that the soviet union was a catastrophe of the 20st century . 
  - good for them . 
  this is pretty biased . 
  there are downs and ups for every system . 
  most elderly people in hungary agree that the standard of living , the quality of arts , entertainment , products ( the list goes on ) were much better . 
  there is no question however , that the corrupt bureaucracy had better living conditions . 
  - that 's not biased , it 's not an absolutely precise statistic , but it 's gerally agreed upon . 
  you would have to know more about our regime , because it was quite different from hungary . 
  this is 100 % true even today . 
  - education maybe , other things - not really . 
  must be language barriers , but this sounds pretty crazy . 
  you might mean that it requires some additional strength ( ? ), 
  to function in a free market society , which to me sounds crazy , or that they could n't properly function from malnutrition which would be true in any environment . 
  - i think it 's clear what i meant . 
  the people simply were n't prepared to face the competition and other free market differences . 
  so you basically think that the corrupt parents and their children make up the communists . 
  damn , that 's some socio-critical skill you got there . 
  - i 'm not saying 100 % were `` corrupt and evil '' , stop pulling things out of your ass . 
  there was lots of naive members of the communist party whose thought they might change something from the inside . 
  well , at least you could say one good thing about them . 
  - nazis were quite dutiful too . 
  statement about drowning in fire is hard not to take seriously , atleast in terms of indelicacy . 
  and here is what i was talking about . 
  i 'm strongly anti islam , yet i 'm able to politely discuss it and accept criticisms . 
  and since culture is a subjective entity ( such as democracy , freedom . . ) there is nothing wrong with supremacists in that matter . 
  if there is , tell me : subjectively there is nothing wrong with slavery that is still lively in many cultures . 
  if there is something wrong with it , according to you , then you 're a cultural supremacist yourself , since you believe your culture which is not based on slavery and rather on freedom , is better . 
  what do you mean `` this generation '' - it could really mean anything , after the velvet revolution there was plenty of people who lived during the first republic . 
  i knew i was right about the bitter girlfriend thing because i simply could n't have imagined some smart czech guy living in luxembourg thinking franz was the most grounded and educated candidate . 
  you 've been exposed to what exactly ? 
  communist or people complaining about the communists ? 
  i think the latter . 
  i doubt you 've seen more than a few `` so-called '' communists . 
  look , there are communist parties all over europe , it 's not just a czech thing . 
  people always like and liked big honorable ideas which offer simple honorable solutions . 
  and history taught us that people do not learn from history . 
  during the communist regime in czechoslovakia there was about 10-15 % of people in the `` upper class '' living good and happy lives - for the price of being rats , informers and denouncers . 
  also there were people who just did what they were told to do and had their security ( cars , education ... ) and they were simply too weak to function in a free market based society . 
  and so a big percentage of these people vote the communist party still and ofcourse a lot of their children do also . 
  the reason why communists got such a big percentage of the votes is because their supporters always come to vote and are dutiful which ca n't be said about average right-wing voter . 
  so if only 60 % of the people go vote and all of the communists you can see why the numbers are the way they are . 
  i hoped this subreddit would have more class and would n't resort to such indelicacy against people calmly expressing their opinions , however disagreeable they may be . 
  and although you 're right about me not being a native speaker , one would have to be absolutely clueless to not understand what you meant . 
  are you against gay marriage ? 
  well , you 're a fucking monster , you should be burned . 
  - interesting morals , ey ? 
  edit : and about the death penalty ? 
  there 're definitely people that would be better off dead ( breivik , fritz , that guy who killed 27 children in school . ), 
  the only danger here is this penalty being used against innocent people . 
  bullshit , first czechoslovakian republic was a proper democracy . 
  who are those that want the old regime ? 
  it 's just a few people , there 's apathy mostly . 
  since you 're not a czech it seems to me that you have a bitter czech girlfriend who has no idea about how things were/are - or a similar scenario . 
  it seems to me that you 're the one joking . 
  franz had no idea what he was talking about and even admitted so . 
  and they should also have helmets with horns , right ? 
  hah , i would have never thought someone would put such a great emphasis on a hair color . 
  exactly . 
  fear mongering , but since it 's for a good cause socialists here will love it . 
  they do this in russia too and it 's the reason why i do n't watch russian television when i 'm there . 
  fucking horrible . 
  if you ca n't back it up do n't use it in an argument . 
  this is actually not so strange , it 's been done in a lot of countries . 
  for example with trans-siberian magistrala in russia . 
  irrelevant , immigration issue in this thread does not apply to finland . 
  got a source for these claims ? 
  seems like a really bad propaganda . 
  yes , you 're killing yourselfs tho . . http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_suicide_rate and ofcourse you have a lot smaller immigrant population ... 
  in sweden ? 
  i think it has more to do with the lack of sunlight and it 's even worse when combined with relative poverty . 
  and i 'm sure immigrants and gypsies are a big percentage . 
  in southern usa it 's mostly mexican criminality . 
  edit : just so it 's clear for some politicaly correct people , i 'm not trying to be racist . 
  i could have claimed german citizenship , sadly these laws are annoyingly patriarchal and i ca n't since my grandmother was born before the 1975 and until this year it 's impossible to inherit citizenship from female side of the family . 
  hope for a change though . 
  i would love to be able to vote in germany . 
  hmm .

  perhaps that 's relative but i really do n't see that or perhaps we should n't think about this border between the east and the west as a sharp line . 
  what are you saying ? 
  that conservatism is not peaceful ? 
  that we should only accept people of the same politial beliefs ? 
  in my experience westerners tend to emphatise form over content when they express themselves publicly , sometimes so much that they simply ca n't say anything worth saying . 
  we on the other hand are very open and do n't care too much about what could be offesive . 
  from one extreme to another . 
  there are virtually no costs to begin with . 
  telephone companies are only charging the fees because they can get away with it , since there is a oligopol of only a few companies . 
   you can ... is n't that hard ... ( wiktionary quote ) you keep saying that yet you refuse to give me anything i can work with . 
  by the way i do n't want you to explain what the sociology is . 
  obviously i do know about sociology . 
  politics are in the scope of sociology to . 
  i just think election results and ideological shifts are more meaningful pieces of evidence than some anecdotes . 
  by the way we always had physical classes separated by sex . 
  does there is islamization in progress here ? 
  right , i would n't call it an islamisation , because the effect , if there even is any , is smaller than the smallest effect i can recognize , indistinguishable from nothing . 
  if you have a better method , then please show it to me , otherwise do n't waste my time with general words about `` basic sociology '' . 
  i do n't see the disagreement . 
  quantify means to assign a number or value . 
  not all things that have noticeable impact are quantifiable !, 
  it may have an impact but i am pretty sure the only way reasonably quantify that impact is by political power . 
  right and al capone was convicted of tax evasion . 
  name of the crime is n't really the main point here . 
  unless there is an islamic political movement gaining power , i would n't called it a `` islamisation '' trend . 
  besides if i extrapolate the datapoints you gave me it give me about 11 % by the year 2100 . http://imgur.com/ksxzmcf, 
  hitchens was talking against censoring a holocaust denial book . 
  the same argument does n't apply to calling for racial violence which was what this guy was apparently guilty of . 
  i do n't think there should be special laws agains nazism and neo-nazism as opposed just general laws against incitement and/or hate crime , on the other hand it 's understadable in europe as relict of post war order . 
  i do n't know enough about this `` glorification of nazism '' case . 
  but now we know he is clearly violent and dangerous . 
  i would n't call him a `` poor guy '' . 
  muslim populations are concentrated in cities so i would n't look for answers in the link you gave . 
  10 % number for france is an upper estimate it 's most likely less . 
  are we talking about the same crime ? 
  this was obviously an assault . 
  i think simmilar study into what policies anti-refugee people want could be interesting , considering how authoratian polititians like orban or zeman are suddenly popular . 
  that does n't look very trustworthy . 
  i guess it might be [ anthropoid ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4190530/ ) . 
  yes , if nazism had some other non-political dimensions i would tolerate them while i would still condemn nazism as a political ideology . 
  nothing would change . 
  i do n't think i can possibly judge everyone , especially when i consider many supported nazis before it their crimes became public knowledge . 
  besides nazism has no other dimension except the political one . 
  there is no analog to worship to be tolerated in the first place . 
  even then it 's very different . 
  you ca n't just assume every single believer is a fundamentalist . 
  religions are despite what religious authorities says are very fluid . 
  they change over time . 
  you ca n't justify banning things like worship just because some different people of technically the same religion done something . 
  tolerating a religion and tolerating attempts to limit freedom of expression are two very different things . 
  ... it 's a duck , assuming you know what ducks look like , which you obviously do n't . 
  shut up . 
  they are not forbiden to speak czech and even if they were it does n't justifies bringing up nazi crimes . 
  it 's disrespectful to victims of nazism . 
  that 's what the mother claims . 
  but there is no evidence of wrongdoing publicly availible because juvenile courts are secret . 
  mother , who made this case public and presents herself as a victim , of course have all the documents including all the evidence from the court , but she choose not to share it . 
  ambassador was disinvited because assurences that there would be no adoption proved to be just empty words , at least that 's what the government claims . 
  final draw of acta was realesed on 15th of april 2011 . 
  european parliament voted on 4th of july 2012 . 
  reminds me of milo\u0161 zeman . 
  he is total asshole too and people voted for him as a sign of a protest against a status quo . 
  do n't do it !, 
  except it is n't really population map . 
  spain and france have much lower population density than germany and italy . 
   no one has to tolerate persecution of converts to islam . 
  of course not , that 's why i called it a misconception . 
  i heard this idea from several muslims . 
  also indonesia has this system where you ca n't change your religion yet it claims to have freedom of religion and is sometimes given as a example of majority muslim country with religious tolerance . 
  i am not saying that germany does n't have freedom of religion because the basic law is written as carefully as universal declaration of human rights to be comprehensible to arabic speaking muslims . 
  problem is that the basic law does not clear their common misconception about freedom of religion that they can persecute against ex-muslims and have to tolerate if the same would be done to converts to islam . 
  good idea in principle but problem is that the basic law is n't exactly shining example of secularism . 
  no mention of separation of church and state . 
  it does not explicitly says individuals have right to change their religion or renounce it . 
  it give parents right to decide whether their children shall recieve religious instruction in state schools . 
  nothing surprising really , hypocrisy is what they get when they base their policies on anger rather than reason . 
  sadly the general response of / r/europe to this piece of news was n't any different . 
  right suddenly cares about refugees and left suddenly forgot about the idea of the universal basic income . 
  i mean when the refugees are on special benefits it actually makes some sense , both economically and socially , to have exception from minimal wage as long as they have the refugee status . 
  i think it 's an idea worth at least considering . 
  i got no response to the actual idea . 
  everybody seems to care only about which side is this piece of news targeted against . 
  this madness made a serious damage to this community . 
  there are both private institutions . 
  i think for example roman van\u011bk is doing pretty good job . 
  as i said , it 's a known problem , but change is slow . 
  that article is about self sufficiency , which is not the same thing . 
  i am not sure how exactly it works . 
  i think it 's often ordered to be made locally by some factory consumer would n't know . 
  anyway i believe when they lend their name to something consumer has every right to direct the criticism at that brand . 
  i understand that there might be legitimate reason to alter the product slightly , but unfortunately it 's too often just an excuse for using cheaper ingredients . 
  perhaps you count babi\u0161 as slovak . 
  seriously foreign capital controls about 20 % . 
  that 's not true . 
  there are better products . 
  i think situation is slowly improving . 
  also most czech food industry is mostly in czech hands . 
  your responses are getting shorter and shorter . 
  there is nothing special about france besides it 's bit more nuclear friendly . 
  other countries could store nuclear waste too , but they do n't want to per popular demand .

  why are they pushing it through that `` narrow '' gap ? 
   this leads me to conclude that the interview is entirely manufactured . 
  there is nothing negative about that claim . 
  it is neither a negative gramaticaly nor it is a negative claim in philosophical terms . 
  besides i have already told you how to prove it 's a manufactured story . 
  what more do you want ? 
  i do n't know any example of manufactured story by rt. 
  they usualy use other means of deception . 
  other people in this thread already gave you example of that . 
  that does not follow . 
  that is only an example of unconfirmed story . 
  you need positive evidence it 's a lie like a word from artur gasparyan that he never said that or a proof that he does n't exist . 
  if it really was a blatant lie such evidence could be easily obtained . 
  if this is your best example then you clearly do n't have anything . 
  you did n't say `` america '' you did say `` you '' . 
  anyway i do need that evidence . 
  give me the best example of such entirely manufactured story you know . 
  your are very cynical person if you believe you need to lie to get what you want , to say the least . 
  for that second claim i will need an evidence . 
   rfe was made in '49 to turn the eastern bloc populations against their governments . 
  they were used as a geopolitical tool to further american interests . 
  true , but you do n't need to use desimformation to do that . 
  nobody have pointed out that the word has two different meanings . 
  original unloaded meaning was simply state funded information source . 
  in this sence rfe is a propaganda . 
  however meaning was shifted with rise of communism , nazism and fasism to deliberate desinformation and lying on a massive scale . 
  rt fits that definition while rfe does not . 
  well , it should n't . 
  skies above ukraine are safer than before the disaster because rebels packed their guided missiles and stopped shooting down planes . 
  that is a normal human behaviour . 
  just after the fatal human error people usually stop doing whatever they were doing when it happened . 
  rebels do n't shoot rockets randomly . 
  gambler 's falacy have nothing to do with it . 
  it 's actualy a scam website . 
  whoever pays them $ 10 will get this fake certificate . 
  i doubt there are any astronomers involved in this . 
  i assume you would still like to stay in the eea and efta like norway . 
   `` the eea efta participation is hence on an equal footing with eu member states . 
  the total eea efta commitment amounts to 2.4 % of the overall eu programme budget . 
  in 2008 norway 's contribution was $ 188 million . 
  throughout the programme period 2007 -- 2013 , the norwegian contribution will increase substantially in parallel with the development of the eu programme budget , from $ 130 million in 2007 to $ 290 million in 2013 . 
  for the eea and norway grants from 2004 to 2009 , norway provided almost $ 1.3 billion . 
  '' [ [ wiki ] ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/norway%e2%80%93european_union_relations ), 
   being negligent is always easier . 
  there will always be reasons why people are under pressure . 
  we are moving in circles . 
  i have already argue this point . 
   that 's a challenge , but not an insurmountable one . 
  the current grid is constructed to work with coal plants , nuclear plants just happened to have the same characteristics so they fit in well . 
  we should restrict ourselves to patterns set in the past . 
  until somebody finds a solution renewables as a primary source of power are not viable . 
  we are not talking about some arbitrary design choice we made in the past we are talking about improving performance of the grid tenfold or hundredfold in multiple ways . 
  unless power grid technology starts to boom as electronics with their moor 's law it will not happen any time soon . 
   if you start building new plants whenever you reach half the age of planned obsolescence , that changes the cost significantly . 
  problem is that germany does not replace old plants at all so average age is much higher than it would be if they did . 
  besided you brought this point as a counterargument to nuclear being more reliable but malfuctions and maintanance is not just problem of nuclear power plants . 
  all power plants might malfuction and might need unscheduled maintanance , but renewables have additional problem of being dependent on weather . 
   but there will always be people who are lax with security . 
  that 's the real problem . 
  not on the same level for the reasons we already talked about . 
  soviet nuclear program was a product of cold war . 
  their were racing to catch up with usa . 
  that were unique historical circustances . 
  i think it is unlikely history will repeat itself in any forseeable future . 
   well , duh . 
  because they 're designed to provide baseload , and the rest of the grid is designed around them . 
  they are not designed to be a baseload source they are a baseload source . 
  it 's their properies which makes them be most efficient when used this way not design . 
  that was my point . 
  you can use any baseload power source to provide all your power without any problems . 
  unfortunately renewables are not baseload sources . 
  trying to use them as such is at very least great engeneering challenge . 
  present day grids are just not nearly good enough to provide capacity and minimalize thermal losses to smooth out say wind power fluctuations if you would want to generate say on average 50 % from wind . 
  weather parerns on average change with hundreds of kilometers which is about the same distance over which present day power grids can conduct eletricity . 
  no matter how you space you windfarms wind would be most likely blowing with the same strenght at all places within the reach of your power grid . 
   they expected to let them live out until they reached their designed age of obsolescence . 
  that is my point . 
  you ca n't really say that this power plant which is nearing obsolence have some difficulties therefore we should not build new more reliable replacements . 
  that 's not a fair argument . 
   nothing really happen ? 
  then you can presumably tell me where all the missing tons of fissile material have gone to ? 
  i thought we talking about civilian nuclear power . 
  nuclear power plants do n't need highly enriched uranium anyway . 
  it 's only another piece of evidence of safety negligence on part of soviet union . 
  they used highly enriched uranium which is usefull in nuclear weapons in nuclear power plants . 
  this can be easily prevented in the future by not using highly enriched uranium so there will be none to lose . 
   two of our local nuclear plants are down for unexpected maintenance too for an undetermined period . 
  i do n't see the difference . 
  you 're just being silly now . 
  there is a major difference . 
  it 's called a [ capacity factor ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/capacity_factor#typical_capacity_factors ) . 
  nukes in general have the best capacity foctors . 
  new ones go often over 95 % which includes maintenance . 
  that is a collosal difference when compared with renewables ~ 30 % . 
  in short time periods renewables fluctuate wildly between 0 % and 100 % . 
  it 's theirs intrinsic property . 
   nuclear and coal are n't very flexible either . 
  gas , hydro and sometimes oil are most often used for that . 
  it 's true their are not as flexible as gas or hydro but they are flexible . 
  they can power down to say 80 % over the course of several hours .

  they are none in my country , except for those who occasionally cross it on their way to/from their pernament bases in germany to/from countries further east from us . 
  it 's a broad topic , so you will have to decide whether to want to cover the entire region ( but you 'll not be able to go really in-depth ) or whether to focus on a specific country ( ies ) - sort of do some kind of case study . 
  you could for example pick two countries , perhaps one that nowadays has problem with democratic backsliding and one that ( seemingly ) does n't and compare the democracy-building developments there . 
  if you want to cover the whole region , you could perhaps focus on the west 's tactics ( specially the eu ) in strenghtening the democracies in cee - and how succesful this was , what possible mistakes were made and so on - for this kind of topic you 're more likely to find english sources . 
  because if you decided to go really in-depth on some country , then i think you would probably have problems to find enough relevant sources without knowing the local language . 
  they do n't really threaten us openly nowadays , but back then when there were plans about placing a us anti-missile radar on our territory ( the plans were later cancelled by the obama administration ) , the subtle threats ( i.e. 
  `` by accepting this radar , you 're making yourselves a target , in case of a nuclear war , this radar could be among the first hits '' etc. ), 
  were rather common . 
  i 'm from the czech republic . 
  i know that kurds exist and that you live in your own autonomous areas in iraq and syria . 
  i also now that turkey has a significant kurdish minority . 
  in terms of religion , i know most of you are muslim , but i tend to associate you with secularism way more than other ethnicities/nations in the middle east . 
  without googling , i must admit that i do n't know what is the most dominant language among kurds . 
  i also do n't know much about your culture and i had no idea that you 're ethnically/culturally close to persians . 
  does that mean you 're close to iran ? 
  when it comes to politics , i know you guys have troubles with turkey . 
  i know there 's a terrorist organization - pkk which also attacks civilians and as such is recognized as a terrorist organization not only by turkey , but also by european countries . 
  but afaik turkey also considers syrian kurdish forces terrorists and i do n't really have an opinion on this , i do n't know whether that 's fair , or whether that 's just turkish power play in the region . 
  i know that my country was sending ammunition and other equipment to peshmerga to support them against isis , but afaik peshmerga only is a military of the iraqi kurds , not the syrian kurds ? 
  peshmerga actually got a quite lot of positive publicity here , they were portrayed as the only local competent force that is able to fight isis . 
  so in general i would say people who know about you mostly have rather positive views , however at the same time there is a huge amount of czechs , perhaps the majority , who know close to nothing about kurds and thus they do n't really have any opinion about you . 
  you can see the net migration rates in european countries in 2013-15 [ here ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/images/a/a1/crude_rates_of_population_change%2c_2013%e2%80%9315_%28per_1_000_persons%29_yb16.png ) . 
  yes , unfortunately this is a fairly common thing with large breeds like bernese . 
  there are some precaution measures that you can take , but sadly you ca n't completely eliminate the risk . 
  it 's a female ? 
  well then obviously she wo n't be as big as a male . 
  you ca n't really compare a female with a male . 
  he grew tall fairly quickly , in a year , he already was this tall , but then it took some 1-2 years to accumulate all the body mass and actually get this large . 
  it 's all a random game of genetics though , not all bernese mountain dogs have the equal size . 
  barney is above-average big , most of other dogs of the same breed are not as big . 
  even two of barneys ' sons who we still see regularely and who are now full-grown adults are not as big as him . 
  barney . 
  [ here ] ( http://i.imgur.com/eh3brct.jpg ) is a bonus picture of him with his offspring . 
  careful , cuteness overload ,

  i 'm cautiously optimistic about the future development within our country , though i do n't believe we will fully catch up with the western europe any time soon ( economy-wise ) . 
  on the other hand , i 'm quite satisfied with many things in my country , such as : * low unemployment * still relatively low cost of living , which means that if you get good education + you have other useful skills and you get a well-paid job , you can have a pretty decent life here * safety - i 'm a young woman , living in the second biggest czech city for 3 years now and i have never ever felt unsafe here , even when walking alone late at night * relatively decent healthcare system , relatively good public unis * the politics here is not great , but despite all the negative trends i think progress is being made , only it 's often not very visible because the negative things draw the most attention * relatively liberal attitudes of the public , but at the same time , not in the overly optimistic and naive way that is sometimes present in the western europe + even people who do not hold liberal attitudes mostly live under the `` live and let live '' motto . 
  that means that even if they personally hold xenophobic/racist/homophobic views , they mostly do not ventilate it on others with that being said , i also dislike a lot of things here , but i do have emotional and family ties to my country so long-term emigration is not something i 'm considering , at least under the current circumstances . 
  unfortunately i 'm rather pessimistic about the overall developments in the world and i 'm worried this might affect my country since we as a small country can not really control much what is going on around us . 
   because we invest a lot of money in these countries , but they do n't doing anything back . 
  if you think you 're not getting anything back , than look at the damn amount of capital that western-owned companies take out of our countries every year in the form of dividents . 
  hint : it 's way more than what we get in the form of eu funds . 
  \u010cesk\u00e9 bud\u011bjovice is a relatively nice city , not as pretty as \u010cesk\u00fd krumlov , but still definitely enjoyable . 
  pilsen is the home of pilsner urquell , so it 's a great place for a beer tour . 
  plus the historic centre is also quite nice . 
  it 's not an ugly city , but also nothing special . 
  if your main concern is the distance from prague , then [ kutn\u00e1 hora ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ryzgklhnwm ) is probably the best choice ( as was already suggested above ) . 
  it 's close to prague , easily reachable by train , it has a unesco cathedral and other nice places to see . 
  no , i do n't think swiss system would work good for my country . 
  that does n't mean i think the whole system is wrong , i just do n't see it working in the czech enviroment . 
  to be completely honest , i do n't have enough trust in my fellow citizens to make informed choices . 
  i do n't have enough trust that some politicians would not try to misuse the referenda to manipulate the public opinion to push their own agenda and i do n't believe that if we ever were to vote on some foreign policy issues , some foreign actors would not try to intervene in the referendum ( looking at you russia ) . 
  the czech public in general is quite apathetic when it comes to politics , so i can completely see that the majority would not bother to vote anyway , so it would be quite likely that the referenda would end up being hijacked by people with radical views from either side of the political spectre . 
  plus i do n't see why people should directly decide about some complex issues which they do n't understand anyway . 
  i know i sound like an intelectual snob right now , but it 's true - the majority of czechs are simply misinformed about many of the affairs concerning economy/foreign relations/social policies and so on . 
  giving them a brochure with same basic information does not guarantee that they will actually read it and understand it . 
  not to mention that some problems are so complex that you ca n't possibly explain them properly in a short brochure . 
  people spend years studying and researching topics of law/economy/international relations and so on in universities and somehow i 'm supposed to expect some random dude in a small czech town to make an educated enough choice on these topics because he read some 5 pages long brochure with fancy graphs and pictures ? 
  this all obviously does n't mean that elected politicians are all perfect and make only the best informed decisions in the interest of the whole country . 
  but at least they 're bearing some sort of responsibility for the country and they 're held accountable in the next elections . 
  what if the people decide for some stupid law in the referendum that will turn out to be harmful in the long term - who is gon na be responsible for that then ? 
   i think everyone agrees the west is defined as those rich countries where the population has a strong sense of smugness ( just for the lack of a better term ) , democracy , individualism and impersonality , rationalism and all such things . 
  what ? 
  i would say that `` the west '' is mainly a geopolitical term that got prominent during the cw , since it was used as a short version for the western bloc ( opposing to the eastern bloc ) . 
  and obviously the countries within the western bloc do share same values , but they also vary in some other things , so there is no universal `` western ideal '' . 
  i mean , the west is the us , and so is france , italy , germany or norway etc. 
  these countries definitely differ in the culture and mentality . 
  i mean generally americans are definitely totally different from , say , norwegians . 
  so what kind of answer are you looking for here ? 
  you could say that estonia is culturally/mentality-wise close to finland . 
  i would argue that we are relatively culturally/mentality-wise close to austrians . 
  and we could go on and looking for other specific similarities , but how can you tell who is the most close to the `` western ideal '' when western countries themselves are so culturally different . 
  that 's very easy in our case - slovakia - both in terms of culture , shared history , language similarities and social connections . 
  perhaps only in the case of economy , germany is a bigger partner for us , but that 's also given by the different size of germany and slovakia . 
  hey , i got a bottle of wine and a glass of expensive olives , plus we also had a christmas party at a nice restaurant with all food and drinks covered . 
  and i 'm not even a full-time worker , since i 'm also still studying . 
  my mom gave all her employees an e-book reader and my dad gave his employees a 13th salary . 
  not all employers in cz are assholes . 
  for the czech pm , it was south moravia - it is a region located in the [ southern-eastern part of the czech republic ] ( http://wiki.rvp.cz/@api/deki/files/8455/=800px-jihomoravsky_kraj.svg.png ) . 
  yeah , that does n't surprise me . 
  sorry about that . 
  we 're doing this kind of shit in many countries . 
  i 've personally met quite a lot of czechs who were doing this in norway while i was there on erasmus . 
  you mean slovak tourists or slovaks in general ? 
  if tourists , we do n't really have a stereotype about them . 
  if in general , we sometimes joke about them being actually hungarian . 
  when we want to be really mean , we wait till slovakia comes up in a conversation and then we pretend we do n't know what slovakia is and ask whoever brought it up whether he meant upper hungary . 
  but this kind of teasing is pretty rare , we mostly get along with them very well . 
  yeah , nowadays it 's basically a slovak running gag . 
  everytime a tourist has an accident anywhere in slovakia , people joke that it must have been a czech . 
  i can usually recognize the two stereotypical types of czech tourists . 
  1 ) the adventurous czechs . 
  they are convinced of their own abilities in hiking/scuba diving/canoeing a wild river/whatever other high-risk sport activity and they make sure to tell everyone around them about it . 
  they usually refuse hiring an instructor ( because they obviously do n't need one ) and have inadequate safety equipment . 
  if you see a person climbing up a mountain in a hot summer in sandals and carrying just a 0,5 bottle of water , there 's a high chance it 's a czech . 
  2 ) czechs who decided not to spend a single extra penny on the vacation than is n't absolutely necessary . 
  so they brought their own food . 
  and they do n't feel bad taking all this home-made food with them everywhere they go . 
  but other than that , i ca n't recognize ordinary czechs by just looking at them , since we do n't really have some specific appearance . 
  you 're totally misguided , clearly \u0160kodas are the best .

  it 's not our fault how the eurozone was set up and how it hurts southern europe . 
  so if you have problems with how eu works , take it to your own politicians , because just blaming the inefficiency of the eu on ee is stupid . 
  we essentially clashed with the eu on one thing and that is the migrant crisis . 
  and even in that case , it was really just v4 . 
  we 're not the sole reason for all eu failings . 
   if we force things through then eastern europe is n't going to be happy . 
  some countries , like romania , bulgaria and crotia are worried that they will be pushed out on the periphery regardless of what they want . 
   a two speed is the only solution . 
  it can help with some things , but it can also bring new problems . 
  essentially , it can eventually totally erode the unity within the eu . 
  and btw this is n't just about ee and we . 
  nordic countries are n't ethusiastic about further eu integration either . 
  are you also gon na push them on the periphery ? 
  i think it more so has to do with the troubles eurozone has been through since 2008 , specially with a connection to the greek crisis . 
  the euro simply lost some of its credibility after that in peoples ' eyes . 
  and also euro support obviously follows roughly the same pattern as the support for eu in general , which took a huge hit with the migrant crisis . 
   when i write eu i mean the entire system working as a whole , composed of member states and institutions , which make decisions together i see . 
  when i write eu i usually mean mainly the commission , because they 're the ones who come up with legislation . 
  and in this specific case , they 're also the ones advocating for the quota system the hardest , the member countries have been not so vocal about it recently . 
  and yes , you 're right that there is a strong sentiment among the pro-eu people in the western europe that the eu should go in the direction of two-speed europe and yes , i have also noticed that some people think that the 2004 expansion was a mistake and those people would certainly prefer if at least some of the new member states were n't in the core . 
  it 's certainly not something you could rule out . 
  i do n't think the commission or the we countries would go as far as formally not allowing us in the core , but they could make the conditions so unappealing to us that we would find it very difficult to agree to them . 
  at the same time , with such steps they might cause serious disruptions to the entire eu structure which would be pretty risky , specially during the brexit negotiations . 
   but it was obviously not going to work at the start . 
  from my point of view ? 
  absolutely yes . 
  but from the point of view of other people , maybe not . 
  it 's my impression that many people in the western europe have some sort of black and white romanticized image of the refugees , whereas in the eastern europe , the opposite case is often true when people just view the refugees as cartoonishly evil . 
  so i can see that people in the western europe might have assumed that the quota system would work and that the refugees are all just poor victims looking purely for safety and shelter and that they will remain wherever they 're send . 
  nowadays it 's quite clear that this did n't happen , but back then in 2015 , this might not have been clear to everyone . 
  however the inability of the eu to acknowledge that the system is n't working now , when we can clearly see so , is really very dissapointing to me . 
  it almost puzzles me to be honest . 
  i do n't know whether it 's just a pure power play , when they just do n't want to admit that v4 was right about this specific thing , or whether they really think that they can actually make the system work . 
  some people at this sub have even speculated that they 're doing this intentionally to push away certain countries to the periphery of the eu . 
  i really do n't know , but you 're absolutely right that the lack of self-reflection is really worrying . 
  however it 's not really just the eu 's fault . 
  ultimately it 's the majority of the member countries that voted for this system and that continue supporting it . 
  if there was n't significant enough support among the member states , the commission would not be able to push for it . 
  could n't agree more . 
  they want their community and they want money . 
  plenty of the refugees from syria or iraq used to be the upper middle class in their countries . 
  the really poor ones did n't make it to europe in the first place . 
  therefore they are used to certain standards and they had expectations that would at least have the same standards in europe . 
  the men were used to making enough money for the entire family . 
  they do n't want their wife to work and be too independent . 
  they were used to having large family and friends circle around them and in estonia , they have none of it . 
  they might have relatives which think that living in europe means being rich , so they expect that they will send them money . 
  in their culture , it 's normal to help out even member of your very extended family and it 's dishonourable when you ca n't do that . 
  at the same time , they are virtually no obstacles for leaving estonia and no risks in case they get caught . 
  nothing can happen to them , at worst , they get send back to estonia from which they can escape very quickly again . 
  the quota system is simply a ridiculous failure , it does n't fix any of the problems that eu has , it just creates more problems in the long term . 
  the recognition of foreign entities is the authority of the government . 
  i believe that in the case of the recognition of capital cities of foreign entities it would be the same . 
  so the pm himself can not recognize jerusalem as the capital city of israel , however the government can . 
  the government does n't have to put this vote through the parliament , all they need to do is to vote on it among the themselves , i.e. 
  the members of the government would have to vote on that and the majority would have to agree with that . 
  it is n't that likely that they will do that . 
  not because they do n't agree with that ( i mean mps belonging to the governmental parties overwhelmingly supported the resolution ) , but because there are certain constraints on our foreign policy through our membership in the eu and i would not expect that our government would want to be the only outlier among the western states when it comes to this issue . 
  but maybe they 'll surprise us , who knows . 
  look , the question in the poll was phrased relatively clearly . 
  it was n't asking about whether you believe a war with russia will or will not happen . 
  it was asking about what should your country do if the war between russia and a neighbouring country happened . 
  and people in several we countries were cca split on that 50/50 , in the case of germany , most people would oppose helping that country militarily despite being obliged to through nato . 
  this sentiment in we that you should avoid a war with russia even if a nato ally is attacked is clearly present among some parts of we societies , so i do n't see why we should pretend like that 's not the case . 
  it 's not really fair to compare western european and american muslims . 
  western european muslims overwhelmingly come from the lower class . 
  they were invited to europe as guest unskilled workers after ww2 or they just came as a result of the ties of some european countries to the post-collonial world . 
  they were mostly poorly educated , often from the rural parts of their home country and so logically they held pretty conservative views . 
  more importantly , they were not supposed to stay . 
  only the plan to have them come only for several years did n't really work out , they had kids in europe and a lot of them somehow managed to stay . 
  but obviously since they were n't expected to stay , we government did n't really try to integrate them , so they ended up at the bottom of the society . 
  which was ok for the 1st generation , because that was still an upgrade from what they had in their home countries , but for the 2nd and 3d generation , it was n't really that good anymore . 
  american muslims on the other hand are mostly the educated , more liberal minded muslims , so of course it 's easier to assimilate such people . 
   they wo n't pay it back . 
  you do n't know that . 
   it 'll disappear in a politician 's pocket . 
  part of it , yes . 
  but we politicians are n't stupid , they know that not 100 % of the money will be spent efficiently and they concluded that it 's still worth it . 
  better have a part of the money go to politicians ' pockets then have ukraine collapse and face a full russian invasion of the eastern ukraine and a total humanitarian crisis right at eu 's borders . 
  ukraine in general needs western political support , so the west has leverage to force them to spend at least part of the money efficiently . 
   raid the militia . 
  we know who they are and where they are , ukraine just wo n't do anything about it . 
  i do n't know enough about the case to be able to say why they do n't try to get back the paintings by force . 
  but do you know for sure that the paintings are still in the ukrainian territory ? 
   we are `` offering '' financial assistance ( free money ) . 
  financial assistence does n't mean free money . 
  ukraine gets loans from the west , under more favourable conditions than some other country would , but it 's still a loan , not free money . 
  and even if it was ` free money ' , it would not truly be free money . 
  almost nothing is really free in international relations . 
  countries give foreign aid , because they hope to secure influence over the recipient countries . 
  or because they just want them to be more stable since their stability somehow helps with their own security . 
  which is precisely the case of ukraine , it 's in the interest of the eu to have a stable ukraine and ukraine can hardly be stable if it goes bankrupt . 
   they did n't give them back . 
  ca n't cooperate with people who wo n't cooperate if the current administrative does n't have the paintings under their control , how can it give it back ? 
  i 'm not convinced handing them free money will fix any of it . 
  you 're not handing them free money . 
  you 're making a trade deal with them . 
  you 're also not giving free money to ee eu states . 
  the eu funds are a form of compensation for ee states for opening their markets to we . 
  rich we states have profited massively from it , we companies are dominating ee markets and are taking massive amounts of money from ee economies back to their home countries in the form of dividents , which in the case of my country are in total much bigger than what we get in the form of eu funds .

  how do the icelanders see the czechs ? 
  the country looks so epic i would consider moving there one day . 
  from what i heard from the guy , the technicians did n't even really know or care what they were handling . 
  they certainly did not read the data themselves and did not try to disclose them to third parties . 
  it seems that this is more a case of what `` could have '' happened than what really did happen . 
  i loved it when i was a kid . 
  i personally know one of the guys involved in the case ( was there ) . 
  i am not sure about the particulars , but he believes the shitstorm that erupted over this is a bit exaggerated . 
  it does n't matter if their other advantages ( like not being thrown away , having to be reassembled after each flight ) outweigh the negatives . 
  skylon 's potential advantage lies in getting a part of the delta-v necessary to achieve orbit by using airbreathing engines in the first stage of the launch , thus saving on the lox part of the propellant mixture ( oxygen is much heavier than hydrogen , so the advantage is greater that it seems ) . 
  it then switches to pure rocket mode to achieve orbit . 
  with the ability to lift 10 + tonnes of payload to orbit and reuse the spacecraft , the advantages over expendable rockets or complicated two-stage reusable systems that need to be reassembled and mated with the payload for each launch are obvious . 
  can they get the 3/5 majority ? 
  more assertions based on nothing . 
  nobody here is claiming that real world space travel is like ksp . 
  skylon has been vetted by esa and found promising , and i think they know better than you . 
  i reiterate : ariane 6 is designed to be expendable . 
  no expendable booster will be competitive in a world where reusable boosters are used . 
  if europe wants to remain competitive in space launch business , it needs something far more innovative that yet another use-and-discard rocket . 
  not because they 're sexy , but because they could offer a much better return on investment and a paradigm shift in space travel . 
  europe needs an answer to spacex , not another expendable booster . 
  based on your expert assessment , of course . 
  i am saying that ariane 5 is a proven and reliable vehicle that can easily continue serving for another decade , while europe invests into something that can actually give it a meaningful edge in space travel . 
  the development costs of ariane 6 do not seem a good investment to me if the result is yet another conventional expendable rocket . 
   nope . 
  a quantum leap is just a change from one discrete energy level to another , and those nergy levels are ( usually ) of extremely small magnitudes compared to human standards . 
  physicists roll their eyes everytime someone uses this . 
  ( also here ) . 
  great way to start your post with showing how little research you put into your thoughts . 
  nope . 
  i am using it in the linguistic sense , you quibble with insisting on the physics meaning , which i am perfectly aware of . 
  the rest of your post does n't deserve a comment . 
  arguing with past failures is n't really a good tactic , as it implies that `` learning from past mistakes '' is impossible . 
  from what i read , watched and listened about skylon , it 's proponents wish to address precisely the failures of previous launch vehicles . 
  that said , shuttle can not be compared to skylon in any meaningful way . 
  it did not use airbreathing engines to save on lox propellant mass , it was a 2.5-stage vehicle , it was designed to be piloted , and it used 1970s era technology . 
  50 years have passed . 
  it 's time to give a ssto a real shot . 
  quantum leap = a sudden large increase or advance . 
  do n't quibble . 
   because we need something reliable , right now , which has proven to work . 
  you mean ariane 5 ? 
   there is n't even a prototype of the sabre engine , implying that this vehicle , should it actually attempted to be built , wo n't be ready for the next 10 to 15 years . 
  do me a favour and read something about their trl . 
  they 're very realistic about it ; what they demonstrated is the pre-cooler , which is 90 % of the trick . 
  the rest is fairly straightforward . 
  with enough funding , you could have demonstrators in a matter of years ( if they do n't work , you can scrap the project ) and prototypes in a decade . 
  this is not something impossible , it 's just ambitious . 
  sadly , it does n't fit much into arienespace ( = france 's ) way of thinking . 
  it wo n't be for much further when reusable falcons really get going and other american companies catch up with spacex . 
  functional reusability has a potential to really drive down the costs , perhaps as much as 10 times . 
  no expendable vehicle will be able to compete with that , we 're looking at a paradigm shift in space business . 
  ad `` dead end '' : nonsense . 
  if you can lift 10 + tonnes of usable payload to orbit , it does n't matter how much `` dead weight '' you 're bringing along . 
  the price of propellant needed to lift it is negligible . 
  skylon 's elegance is that it makes space launches more `` ordinary '' and `` airline like '' . 
  spacex 's approach still requires reassembly of the rocket stack for each launch . 
  any kind of two-stage vehicle will always bring along unnecessary complexity due to need of re-assembly before each launch , even if it is nominally more `` efficient '' in terms of mass ratio . 
  skylon ( with some simplification ) would only need to be inspected , refuelled , reloaded with cargo and sent up again . 
  rapid turnaround with minimum between-flight maintenance and assembly is a much more promising approach to spaceflight . 
  it is ambitious , yes , but we 're finally approaching the tech-level to make it happen . 
  europe should decide to be a leader , not a follower . 
  sabre is very likely to work . 
  with an accelerated programme , we could have a working prototype within 10 years . 
  ariane 5 could continue serving in the meantime and there is also vega for smaller satellites and soyuz ( kourou version ) for medium-lift needs . 
  i do n't see much forward thinking in developing yet another expendable launch vehicle for gto launches that does n't push the technology any further than where we already are . 
  it wo n't give europe any kind of hope of a manned programme , it wo n't be able to compete with reusable spacex launch vehicles or the chinese , when they iron out the bugs on their vehicles , it 's just there to feed esa member state 's contractors with fresh aerospace contracts . 
  useless . 
  sigh . 
  why do n't we develop [ skylon ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/skylon_ ( spacecraft ) ) , rather ? 
  classic rockets are a dead end . 
  europe with its structures and bureaucracies will never be able to compete with the likes of spacex . 
  we need a quantum leap , and a reusable ssto spaceplane would be it . 
  it would be expensive , but everything in space is , and would give europe capability in space nobody else has . 
  instead , we 're developing a boring , old-school rocket for launching satellites . 
  sigh . 
  are you being deliberately obtuse ? 
  what they are proposing is for the eu to process migrants outside eu territory . 
  nobody is saying it is easy , it 's just necessary . 
  italy 's stance in this case seems to be : * `` we ca n't do anything about this , the migrants will just keep coming , we wo n't stop them , pls help us by taking them to your countries '' . 
  * and you wonder why people might have a problem with that ? 
  for the frak 's sake : you leave your ports open for migrants , so they keep coming . 
  what can `` we '' do about it ? 
  nothing . 
  migrants can get here only because the frontline countries let them . 
  clearly , the solution requires eu-wide co-operation aimed towards stopping people from coming to europe . 
  as i said , this needs to be an eu policy , not an unilateral action of one country . 
  as for the rest of your trolling , you know where to stick it . 
  maybe you do n't . 
  but it raises an interesting question : say the whole africa and middle east become totally chaotic , lawless , with 500 million people fleeting these regions . 
  should europe accept all these people because they are `` refugees '' ( current eu population is approx . 
  500 million ) ? 
  where is the limit to our goodwill and assistance ? 
  because clearly , fanatically observing `` international law '' would mean turning your countries into the same mess the migrants are fleeing from . 
  or in other words , to who do national governments and their associations ( including the eu ) owe primary allegiance : their people , who do n't want their countries swamped with third world migrants , or `` international law '' , i.e. 
  it 's uncompromising ( fanatical ) application ? 
  i say the former . 
  europe should finally start looking after its vital interests in this issue . 
  the `` quota system '' is not working not because of v4 , but because nearly all eu countries ignore it ( for the same reasons as v4 , they just pretend they agree and slam v4 for not showing `` solidarity '' ) . 
  russian sanctions are a result of russian expansionist policy in the ukraine , which is a completely separate issue from `` how we should deal with the migrant crisis '' .

  i would translate a bit myslef to spread cimrman 's genius edit :  what do you do next ? 
   split the atom . 
  ... no ... sorry , first is to split the austro hungarian empire . 
  then split the atom, 
  5 % for czech seaside 4 % for romanian seaside  mfw romania actually has a seaside, 
  do those fucktards have the red cross as a flag ? 
  did they use their special logic to consider it unclaimed for some reason too ? 
  there 's zero reason for any concern . 
  economical migrants will not stay here . 
  they will carry on to the countries they decided for . 
  actual refugees are welcome and i am pretty sure they will contribute to the country . 
  also czech society and culture is not so politically correct and inclusive so there will be no discussion with political islam . 
  sobotka noticed that greece asked for more money and analyzed that them leaving eurozone would have political impact . 
  he keeps his thought and bravery-to-say-something levels unusally high, 
  the website is atrocious on mobile, 
  totally agree that bailing out the banks is borderline criminal . 
  anyone caught in debt trap should be able to have some way out of it . 
  actually , greece leaving the euro is really bad for germany and france for another reason . 
  they need countries like that to devalue euro . 
  if germany had its own currency , it would have exchange rate of something around 1.2 $ at least . 
  good luck with sustaining the export power house with that . 
  there goes the fairy tale that czechoslovakia was one of the most developed countries in the world prior to the wwii ( during the first republic ), 
  that 's a nice ass you 're talking out of, 
  you must be kind of big deal , right ? 
  you know a lot about stuff as well . 
  you can deduct about unprecedented stuff from other stuff too .

  card blanche for overturtning national legislation is a bit of novelty , though . 
  did we sort of became the east germans ? 
  not that i understand the article , but the people arriving to greece are quite likely to be refugees , but they should anyway stay in turkey . 
  with italian migrants , it 's little bit different . 
  the boat trip across mediterranean is not cheap , people arriving in italy are not desperate migrants . 
  yep . 
  it would have other advantages though . 
  i think we are productive and exporting enough to take it and the risk of greeking would be low . 
  we would be more likely to be like slovakia , who gained from euro . 
  what i am worried the most is that joining the monetary union would be done under the current exchange rate , robbing us of ~ 10 % of cash savings permanently . 
  the currency was depreciated about a year and a half ago . 
  i think this is one of its results . 
  so ... if you want to buy imported stuff you get less , but averaged accross population we might be slightly better off . 
  if the pace keeps up , it will be well worth it . 
  so the currency depreciation was good for something . 
  i think we all paid for this growth , but might have gotten a little bit more back . 
  i hardly know of any unemployed people . 
  imo who wants to work can find work ( but might be below his desired salary level or even qualification ) . 
  live in the west for clarification, 
  if bulgaria offered to take care of a migrant at cost of xx $ per month they would get the `` business '' and be paid by the rest of the community . 
  they would also get to say when they have enough ... 
  the eu community would of course pay bulgaria for the services provided . 
  i thought this was clear, 
  sorry if i offended anyone , but bulgaria has the lowest gdp per capita in eu , so i would assume that it would be the least preferred state for economical migrants, 
  nothing against bulgaria . 
  however , i wonder how bad the migrants ' former lives must have been if they do n't settle for anything less than nordic social system, 
  did anyone go to jail ? 
  unfortunately it 's how it 's in most europe . 
  not a bad trade off if the alternative is going to jail for questioning the government though .

  i wished that we could all sort of find the right middle ground , where we 're not hysterical but also not naive . 
  of course some ee leaders can also be blamed for failing to decrease the tensions and finding a common ground , it 's not just we 's fault . 
   therefore our primary mission should be to fight the causes of mass migration from the mena countries , and not talking about quotas . 
  absolutely agree . 
  the eu needs strong common foreign policy to be a strong influential player so that we 're able to handle these things before they blow up to our faces . 
  unfortunately for a common foreign policy we need a political union , for a political union , we need a fiscal union , and all this is just not happening any time soon . 
  so we will have to do with some partly-common foreign policy , under which we will be working together on non-controversial issues where all member states can agree or we will work closer together in different regional blocs where it 's easier to find consensus . 
   the sexual attacks in germany were very isolated incidents . 
  less than one percent of all immigrant criminality are sex crimes . 
  violent crime is quite low as well . 
  most of immigrant criminality are minor offensens and immigrants are not more criminal than the local population . 
  immigrant criminality per capita is also declining . 
  unfortunately this is not always about facts , but about emotions . 
  look at brexit , there were number of studies saying that ee migrants are beneficial to the uk , yet many brits still despise ee migrants and think they 're a burden to the country . 
  as i said , the atmosphere in ee ( and probably to a smaller extent in we as well ) is pretty toxic now , people will jump on the `` i hate all muslims '' bandwagon very easily once there is a case of muslims commiting violent crimes . 
  heck many already jumped on that bandwagon and there are hardly any muslims living here for now . 
  i think you kind of underestimate the fear and hostility people feel towards muslims here . 
  imagine spending most of your adult life isolated from any foreign cultures , being unable to travel or having any sort of contact with different races/cultures/religions . 
  suddenly after all this all you can hear from the media is 9/11 , sharia law , isis , terrorism in the western world , ghettos in the western capitals , charlie hebdo , sexual attacks , honor killings , abuse of sexual/ethnic/religious minorites in the middle east and so on . 
  that 's a lot of negative stuff , no wonder that people here are hysterical . 
  on the other hand , i always try to stick with the facts , but even i 'm very sceptical towards immigration from mena and that 's just because if you look at the region , it 's not exactly a liberal paradise . 
  women , gays or atheists are opressed in almost in every middle eastern country . 
  even the role-model muslim majority countries like indonesia or malaysia are not exactly so great at gender equality as is the standard european country . 
  i , as a young woman , would not want to live in any muslim-majority country , simply because i do n't believe that my rights would be respected there . 
  so when i see the prospects of thousands of people from the mena coming to my country , i feel very conflicted . 
  one hand , i would like to help people in need , on the other hand i see what are the average values people hold in mena , so i can assume the average mena migrant will hold them as well and he will not magicaly give them up once he reaches europe . 
  he might not commit crimes , but he can still be very conservative , he can be against homosexuals , he can restrict his daughters from dating czech boys , he can demand that we adjust our values to his . 
  and i just do n't want people like this in my country on the pernament bases . 
   that 's one reason why i do n't want refugees in romania or hungary for example . 
  to be frank , i do n't believe their authorities are capable to identify possible terrorists before they enter western europe . 
  i understand that you might not trust hungarian or romanian authorities , but i think that 's just prejudices to a big extent . 
  if some authorities proved to be very inefficient during this whole crisis , than it 's belgian authorities . 
  ee countries are poorer , not necessarily more incompetent . 
  other than that i agree with all your points about what needs to be working if we want to have an efficient european migration strategy , i think you have sumped it up perfectly . 
   sooner or later the ee countries will run into the same problems as the we countries : labour shortages in fields like health care for example . 
  that 's were the ee countries will need immigration , and eu immigration wo n't be enough close the gaps . 
  ee already has big issues with this , it 's not just we thing . 
  most ee countries are suffering from brain drain and low fertility rates , so yes , we do need migration to balance this out . 
  believe it or not , my country actually has had positive net migration in the last decade , we have plenty of slovaks , ukrainians and vietnamese here , along with other ee nations . 
  prague and brno are actually becoming quite popular with young expats from all over the world , since the cost of living is low and the standard of living is pretty much the same like in the we . 
  this is why i often sort of cringe when i hear people from we lecturing us about how what 's the right imigration policy . 
  i mean no offense , but it was n't us who after ww2 invited hundreds of thousands uneducated low skilled gast workers and then failed to properly integrate them . 
  the cost of this are still seen in france , belgium and as far as i 'm concerned even the turkish minority in germany is not exactly perfectly assimilated . 
  on the other hand our migrants in cz have integrated without any sort of troubles , they have jobs , their kids do well at school , basicaly you hardly know they 're here . 
  so i would just like to continue with our current imigration policy , because why breaking something that works well for us . 
  we still have a lot to improve and we can learn a lot from we and i welcome all advice in areas where we lag behind , but imigration is just not one of the areas . 
  if germany feels like they want to have more people from mena , fine , that 's your business , but we have a different migration strategy . 
  refugees are one thing , opening your country to economic migration from mena is another , we prefer economic migrants from other areas of the world . 
  `` you 're in my spot '' - sheldon cooper . 
  i was really not trying to advocate anything in the previous post , i was just saying what the commission wants . 
  you 're right that the dublin does n't work well , but the solution to that is not to replace one failed system with another failed system . 
  the quotas already proved to be not working , so to come up with a plan that we will just wait until one country is overwhelmed and then start relocation is just not a good plan in my view . 
   these countries are slowly but steadily exposed to immigration , they will understand that immigration ( in a controlled environment ) is not a bad thing and nothing to be afraid of . 
  that would only be the case if the immigration indeed runs smoothly . 
  if something like in germany or sweden ( the sexual attacks ) or in france or belgium ( terrorist attacks ) happens here , you can expect people to go nuts . 
  i think immigration is not a bad thing when you 're getting people who are educated or have a high potential to become educated and who hold similar liberal values which are compatible with our societies . 
  if you receive people coming with very backwards views and with very slim chances to find a job , then it 's something you can be legitimately afraid of , because the chances are high that these people will not integrate . 
  people in ee see how mass immigration of people from the third world worked out in we and they do n't want to repeat these mistakes . 
  sure , they can stay temporarily as refugees , but once the conflict is gone , they need to go back ( or ideally they should be kept in refugee camps close to their home countries ) . 
  thanks your all that information , it 's really interesting . 
  i had no idea that it took so long for the white ethnic groups to melt - i always supposed that it sort of happened at the beginning . 
  i think this shows how incredibly problematic it would ( will ) be for the eu to try to become a federal state . 
  we ( nations of europe ) might be all somewhat similar , but there are still big differences between us and as you mentioned your gov only accomplished to create this american identity when they outlawed the communities , which is unacceptable in europe , the eu can only use soft power . 
  at this point , i 'm not sure if all these efforts to create federal europe are not just doomed to fail , since there is just no such thing as european nation and there will not be one in the near future or maybe ever . 
   i would drop the quotas for the eastern european countries for now and instead ask them to work together with the eu and offer space and personnel for eu run and managed refugee shelters . 
  just make our lives a little bit easier while we , the eurozone countries , make more space , work through the backlog and establish an eu authority that can handle these things smoothly on its own . 
  i 'm not sure why you 're splitting it on eurozone vs non-euro countries though , slovakia and the baltics have euro and they are not in any way more keen on getting migrants than , say poland , czech republic or hungary . 
  but otherwise i absolutely agree and i think that would be a reasonable approach . 
  specially since i forgot to mention that pushing quotas will eventually make it even harder for we to cooperate with the ee , since there would be a high risk of anti-eu parties getting in the government and hinder any sort of progress in the eu . 
  our pro-eu politicians right now have their hands tied , they simply ca n't accept quotas even if they know that a few thousands of people a year would be manageble , because they 're risking that they will get replaced by someone who will refuse the quotas . 
  and not just the quotas , but also possible progress on common eu foreign/defense policy which is what our government is in favour of right now , but who knows what will happen in the next election cycle , if the commission continues with the counter-productive `` 250 thousands euro for each rejected refugee '' plan . 
  thank you for clarifying this . 
  you 're right that i only have a superficial understanding of the american society . 
  from the outside perspective it seems like you 're doing a better job at integrating muslims , but it could be just me focusing more on the situation in the western europe and not noticing all the problems in the us . 
  but still , at least you did n't intentionally invite hundreds of thousands of low-educated people from rather backwards countries and then failed to integrate them , because you assumed that they would all go back once the jobs were no longer there for them . 
  which is what we countries did after ww2 . 
  what you 're describing about muslims being relatively liberal on the outside but still pretty conservative in the inside is indeed very problematic and to some extent we have this here as well . 
  i have recently read a study about former chechens refugees who decided to stay in cz after escaping the war in chechnya and there was the same problem with them . 
  they had jobs , czech friends , they even celebrated christmas , but they would not let their daughters to even go on a school trip out of fear that they might start something with a non-chechnyan boy . 
  i really do n't know how to tackle this . 
  of course you can make people follow all the written laws , but how to make them respect the general values of the society is another thing . 
  and then it 's really hard to blame people for being very sceptical towards all muslims when cases like this happen . 
   is that something the people in eastern europe could accept ? 
  i ca n't possibly speak for all people in eastern europe , but honestly i feel like at this point the atmosphere here is quite toxic . 
  people are super sceptical about migrants from muslim countries being able to integrate in our societies , western europe in this sense seems like an example we want to avoid . 
  i 'm not going to sugar-coat this - the majority of people here just do n't want any migrants from the middle east and africa coming here and they will not be happy about any solution which would mean we would be getting them . 
  however if they knew that these people are only here for a temporary time period , they would probably reluctantly accept that . 
  that was actually a solution i was also thinking about - redistributing the refugees for the time their asylum application is handled to ease the administrative burden from greece and italy and keep the refugees in locked refugee facilities to prevent them from leaving to other eu country and also to prevent the local population from getting alarmed . 
  once their application is approved , they would get the right to move freely in europe , if it got denied the specific country would be responsible for deporting . 
  but unfortunately i do n't believe that the things will , as you say it , run smoothly . 
  i think the whole quota system proved to be a total failure so far , since the majority of the migrants want to go to germany/benelux/uk / sweden and they will always find ways to get there unless we will just lock them up pernamently , which would be unacceptable from the human rights perspective . 
  i 'm afraid that the future of the mena region will be so unstable due to many different factors that there will be millions of people heading to europe in the next few decades and i do n't believe the current approach ( just waiting till one country is overwhelmed and then start a relocation system ) is sustainable , i think even people in we will eventually turn on this and the eu will have to adopt australian-style migration policy otherwise it will just fall apart . 
   i would rather take in a few thousand refugees and be done with it , than to be alone with the problem and constantly have to fight at my borders . 
  and i 'm sure that many people in eastern europe see it the same way . 
  they just do n't trust the eu enough at the moment and do n't believe that the eu is capbable of doing that for them . 
  i think this is very true . 
  i would say most people in ee would calm down if they knew that the eu would be sending at most a few thousands of refugees , but as for now they do n't believe that the eu can do anything about limiting the numbers of the migrants and many do n't even believe that the eu is even trying to do that , they think that the `` refugees welcome '' attitude is basicaly the eu 's official policy . 
  so when the eu proposes pernament quota system people ( including me ) will find that unacceptable , because there is no upper limit at all and we ca n't possibly know how many that would be in the future . 
  we do n't know how the eu will handle the next big refugee crisis ( and looking at the demographic , climate and political prospects of the mena region , i 'm pretty sure there will be a future crisis ) . 
  if the eu handles the next crisis as badly as this one and the quota system is already in place , it could mean we would be getting tens of thousands of people .

   honestly that seems extremely costly ( and it is extremely costly for australia ) less costly than providing full welfare benefits to migrants inside eu . 
  by far . 
  i did n't , you proved to be of little intelligence . 
  do n't call me shirley . 
  well then read the rest of my comment . 
  the camps will be fenced and guarded . 
  you will be put in and you wo n't be able to escape . 
  the only way out will be deportation to your country of origin or your asylum being granted in the eu . 
  people that will come via turkey will be caught ( either on sea or on land ) and * put * into these camps . 
  just as [ australia is doing it ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pacific_solution ) . 
  well , if we closed the borders when we said we should , there would n't be 800,000 migrants in europe , but 200,000 . 
  nevertheless , we should close it now , because soon there 'll be 2 million . 
  after the borders are closed , we can talk about what to do with those that are currently here . 
  you put them in these eu-run extraterritorial camps . 
  turkey wo n't , plenty of other mena countries will . 
  you buy it from the mena countries , like you would buy land normally . 
  costs will be paid by the eu . 
  the entire eu will be happy to contribute , eastern europe especially , since it will mean no muslims forcibly resettled on their territories . 
  god , you 're kind of thick . 
  how about you read the [ encyclopedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eastern_europe ) yourself . 
  new extraterritorial eu-run camps in one or more of the numerous mena countries . 
  [ would you like to know more ? 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pacific_solution ), 
  poland , slovakia and czech republic are also often called eastern europe , because they too were part of the warsaw pact . 
  we 've been proposing a better permanent and workable solution all along . 
  close the borders , copy australia . 
  the temporary german `` solution '' of redistributing 120,000 migrants was backed by most of western europe . 
  the permanent unlimited quotas , however , were far too much even for western europe . 
  thus the only viable long-term solution is to close the borders . 
  geographically they 're central europe , but politically they can be called eastern europe . 
  croatia and slovenia are n't eastern european countries . 
  they 're either central europe or balkans . 
  no eastern european country is on the migration route since hungary fenced up . 
  it took them long enough . 
  but at least it 's happening already . 
  i do n't think so . 
  and even if they tear a section down , we 'll just double down , eu states will send police reinforcements and the section will be rebuilt . 
  that 's an understatement , from this day forth , no country on the migrant route will register a single migrant . 
  well , here in europe it 's more of a `` let 's not import the entire world to our small country , let 's keep it the way it is , because we like it '' . 
  no no , i pointed out his former title simply to indicate that someone who used to be a british foreign secretary probably is n't a complete idiot like many pundits today . 
  i would have thought the majority of people would agree on that . 
  and i 'm saying every politician today has some angle . 
  the australian solution works if you have an extraterritorial camps no matter where . 
  there are plenty of mena countries that 'll be amenable to providing us with a bit of land . 
  in today 's world , you can say that about literally everyone . 
  the former british foreign secretary basically shares and confirms the opinion of many of us anti-immigration people on this sub . 
  interesting times ahead . 
  i think our whole nation trapped itself by this . 
  but it does validate the fact that it has been true in almost every election since the start of portuguese democracy . 
  my point is that humans have selective memory , and thus almost * always * think the current idiots are always half-assing it somehow more than the last ones , despite it not being objectively true . 
  then you really should know by now that it 's almost * always * a `` half-assed left [ / right ] block that has come to emerge in [ country ] and is made up of complete retards '' . 
  i suspect these are one of your first elections . 
  aggressive beer pricing . 
  we 'll make you drunk despite your better judgement !, 
  that is the sole fault of the eu/merkel which is aggressively pushing something most countries * do not want * . 
  that could n't happen in my proposed confederation . 
   ukip might not , but the idea of free trade is not nearly as strong on the continent as it is in the uk that 's not true . 
   the so called external military threats succeeded because of the total incapacity of the sejm to govern the country . 
  i wonder how much putin would have to bribe someone like orban to use his veto ... 
  even if putin made the confederation not work , it would n't matter one bit , because the sovereign countries would work well by themselves . 
  i do n't think ukip and other eurosceptic parties have anything against free trade . 
  the confederation would certainly * not * include a mandatory free movement of people for work , read my second comment . 
   ah yes , just like the sejm of the glorious commonwealth of poland-lithuania . 
  good times . 
  comparing the incomparable . 
  polish commonwealth failed because of external military threats . 
  we have nato for protection , and nato does n't need unanimous voting . 
  someone 's [ huffing gas ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ib5p7f0krwu ) . 
  first quota was 40,000 , second was 120,000 , thus i believe the third one will be about 400,000 , if it 's not the permanent unlimited quota already . 
   can you elaborate on this ? 
  what are the main attributes/powers that are now missing and would be regained ? 
  the main issue today of course is migration . 
  and not just from outside of the eu , i believe intra-eu migration should also be regulated . 
  i sympathize with britain : they are the only major english speaking country , and thus are the target of the vast majority of people wanting to relocate to another eu state . 
  they should be allowed to regulated this influx to their liking . 
  if this was n't mandated in the eea treaties , i believe switzerland would join it as well , for example . 
   would this include people and finances or just goods ? 
  there is a difference between those . 
  a confederation would have all of them as far as i know and we 'd be back to square one . 
  so i assume that the name union or confederation is not really the issue and your answer to my first question would most likely reveal them . 
  it would mainly include goods and services . 
  including finances ( capital movements ) would be optional , i.e. 
  a country would be able to stop it temporarily . 
  and free movement of people ( for work ) would be completely voluntary , i.e. 
  country could put any restrictions on it they wished . 
  i chose the name confederation simply to indicate its opposition to eu federalization . 
  it would be sui generis just as the eu is . 
  for me , it 's the collapse of the eu , restoration of sovereignty of individual eu countries , and then slow economic cooperation on european level . 
  i want to see a european confederation based on unanimous voting . 
  it 'll mainly concentrate on a single market and free trade . 
  it can have other pillars , but they have to * always * be agreed upon by all members unanimously . 
  yes , unanimous voting can be a hassle , but it 'll basically end any euroscepticism , because the ec will contain only things that * all * countries voluntarily agree on . 
  and yes , that 's enough . 
  and for defence , there 's nato . 
  this will be downvoted by every spaniard in this thread as usual , but whether or not you 're a civilized country remains to be seen . 
  if you are indeed civilized as you claim , you will grant catalonia their independence ( referendum ) like britain , canada and czechoslovakia did before . 
  i bet the uncle would point out that that 's not a good thing for the german nation . 
  notice i did n't say that . 
  i 'm simply saying the idea of returning them to hungary is idiotic and without any basis in law . 
  i personally believe the migrants are solely germany 's responsibility for two reasons : 1 .

  or perhaps reminisce ?

  i upvoted you , so there , some karma !, 
  it 's the only way the germans will realize they have to reverse course . 
  they failed to come to their senses so far , so they need shock therapy . 
  sadly it seems only after refugees come into enough villages like that the people will finally realize what mistake they made in letting merkel run amok . 
  thanks !, 
  if you can , edit it into your above comments . 
  that is honestly ridiculously heinous !, 
  feudalism and kingdom are not related concepts . 
  all current european kingdoms are constitutional monarchies with democratic systems of governance . 
  well , except vatican . 
  vatican is still ridiculous . 
  there are two groups of swedes : those who believe the newspapers and bloody racist cunts !, 
  nature is racist !, 
  it 's not ridiculous to be a kingdom due to historical reasons . 
  but it 's completely ridiculous to form a new kingdom in the 20th century !, 
  britain was formed in 1707 , uk in 1801 . 
  and their constituent kingdoms are roughly a thousand years old . 
  what do i see ? 
  german humour ?!, 
  wow , yugoslavia indeed was a kingdom , for a second there i thought you were kidding !, 
  a new kingdom that * formed in 1918 * ? 
  that 's pretty ridiculous !, 
  roughly 27 of them . 
  then they could fight for their freedom of expression . 
  things will never get better if the rich keep shuffling off to better countries . 
  and the 32 are probably thinking of skipping to germany once they get here comfortably on the plane . 
   good integration is not impossible . 
  show me one country that managed to integrate a large group of ardent muslims , and then we can talk . 
   closing our borders is not a sustainable solution for europe . 
  yes it is . 
  population is shrinking only very slowly . 
  and we can incentivise our populations to have more kids , like the french did . 
  there 's some truth to that . 
  a war you can win . 
  ^ ( i 'm not advocating war here though . ), 
  i honestly think europe is n't above another genocide . 
  not if things continue to be worse and worse . 
  people that feel they 're losing their home and identity are n't nice people .

  wow , they are really literally named that way !, 
  what the fuck ? 
  immigration blues ? 
  please share . 
  grab a whiskey and sing the blues . 
  ` cos this is happening whether you believe it or not . 
  we 're thankfully not pc enough to destroy ourselves . 
  aim your questions at abdullah abu abdulaziz bastin . 
  i find it so laughably silly when people say they personally hardly notice problems now . 
  the * real * problems wo n't come now , no , first the migrants will bring their families of 3 to 8 persons each , and live * mostly * peacefully . 
  there will be problems , but you 'll manage . 
  no , the real fun parts start when the 2nd and 3rd generations turn to radical religion for their source of identity , when they refuse to integrate to society because they do n't feel part of it . 
  that is when the fun starts , just you wait . 
  in the meantime , please , do n't be a * dick * and do n't push your quite frankly horribly foolish decisions on our small countries . 
  ** the immigrants , he concluded , have done enough , `` too much '' even , to integrate themselves : `` now it 's up to belgium to adapt . 
  i do use a bit of hyperbole , but i honestly believe it will be bad . 
  many countries already have . 
  war . 
  africans have been controlling their population that way for ages . 
  it 's just now that the continent is getting too dangerously safe . 
  they 'll keep coming , even in rough seas . 
  and they 'll start dying more , and merkel will be ashamed and order to start rescuing the boats 50 meters from the turkish coast . 
  better selfish than destroyed . 
  land crossings are far easier than water crossings and your us-mexico border is 3,145 km long . 
  greece-turkey border is a few km . 
  water crossings are hard , easily discoverable and fully preventable if you do n't mind crossing into torkey 's waters , which we 'll soon have the agreement to do . 
  that 's an unresolved question though . 
  there are proposals to build an agi not from bottom up , but wholesale . 
  one way that might work is trying to copy with enormous precision the entire human brain and its functions into a virtual environment and then just jump starting it in there . 
  other way i 've read about is building a virtual environment and simulating evolution in it , basically letting a high functioning brain evolve the second time . 
  these approaches evidently wo n't work now , but say in 50 or 100 years , who knows ? 
  i 'm sorry , i meant an artificial general intelligence ( agi ) , a strong ai if you will . 
  there 's also option 3 : we develop an artificial general intelligence . 
  `` never '' is a loooooong time . 
  `` never '' is far too strong a word for this statement . 
  that 's still pretty mild honestly . 
  it wo n't really stop the migrants . 
  lmao, 
  in sweden there wo n't be many , really . 
  just a few ghettos here and there for swedish people , everything else will be migrant territory . 
  estonia ca n't into nordic !, 
  nordic can into bestonia !, 
  say what you will about bashar al-assad , but he sure is more rational than the swedish government . 
  ehm , in an independent bavaria , csu would probably be the largest political party . 
  and your nation . 
  i do n't remember , i suspect those people did n't either . 
  not everyone is fully informed on everything . 
  and it is good that in a thread about rt tv news the debaters are critical unless any reliable source is provided . 
  actually , since basically all refugees arriving in greece had to take the boats , it shows that fences can clearly very well stop overland crossings .

  it would have been better , if there was someone else then hofer for the austrian side . 
  visegrad group was established after the fall of communism . 
  it was supposed to help with european integration of these 4 member states with similar interests and with similar experience of totalitarian rule . 
  all member states are in eu and nato now . 
  later , the cooperation started to focus on energy , economy etc. 
  with 26 years after the fall of the iron cutrain , it 's natural that each country is developing differently and their policies and interests differ . 
  poland and hungary have conservative leaders at the moment and their direction is not the way czechs would go : like christian-conservative values are in quite a contrast with traditionaly atheist-liberal values in cz . 
  i welcome more cooperation with austria and slovakia as they create our south-east border and both are economically important to us and culturally similar . 
  strong ties with germany are a must , as our economy is highly dependant on their . 
  cooperation with poland in economical and infrastructural issues stays very important and may increase further . 
  this lack of respect towards women in mena countries is really deep rooted , it 's terrible . 
  i 've read that algeria is a hell for female travelers . 
  uk and eu gon na sort it out in the end , cos they need each other . 
  obviously , both sides use `` strong words '' now , cos it 's before negotiating the deal . 
  they will have to find compromise . 
  well , we are quite unique even when trying to tear europe in 3 blocks ( north , south , east ) . 
  we are pretty central europe and not only in the geographical context . 
  nationalism is not a thing in cz unlike other countries and it has never been . 
  our population is leaning towards the left and liberals in elections ( even old style soviet-like communists rank as the 4th most popular party ) . 
  also , we are liberal in many ways of life and religion is almost non existant . 
  regarding the current wave of refugees , people were not feeling it since the begining and our politicians ( which we rightfully critizise 100 % all the time ) did n't act as if nothing happened or like it 's all fine , but they said what people wanted to be said . 
  there were obviously some out of place comments ( zeman and others ) , but the core message has been said and our stance presented . 
  we do n't see huge leaning towards right like in the west currently , cos our stance is clear since the begining and people do n't feel unheard or avoided like in some other countries . 
  economically , we are dependant on germany and it 's clear to all political parties , so is acted upon ( when merkel visited cz currently , the main focus was on business and research instead of refugee policy where we disagree ) . 
  good way of life , prosperity and peace are the main concerns of czech population and anything which might outbalance it , is met with strong reaction ( regardless of religious , right-left , sectarian , ultranationalism , war-seaking , violence etc. 
  type of extreme ) . 
  anyone surprised brexit day http://i.imgur.com/zcfozrg.jpg old guy : rupert murdoch bearded guy : lebedev , son of russian oligarch and owner of many uk newspapers, 
  saudi arabia is so strange country . 
  they are extreme even in the comparison with their arab neighbours . 
  i get , that the saudi family might be `` moderate '' when taking in cosideration the ultra conservative groups inside the country . 
  however , this does n't mean , that we shall close our eyes and supply them with weapons . 
  saudi clan shall try harder to slowly liberalise the society there . 
  with all beying said , we shall not tolerate saudi financed mosques , saudi imported preachers , saudi policies etc. 
  cos it 's the extreme of extreme and it has no place in 21st century whatsoever . 
  we are not safer by sending them weapons , but it 's the other way around . 
  rip, 
  so , local companies should stand up to the game, 
  hopefully , it can get into flow of innovations and startups based here in cz,

  everyone knows prague , but there are many gems outside of the capital hidden in the countryside . 
  lol, 
  rome, 
  better one is that you pay for the digital infrastructure , which they use for even more of profit lol small and medium sized tech companies are disadvantaged against them , which in the end is bad for the final consumers - you lol, 
  there are plenty and ( something that might shock you ) they pay taxes, 
  we would like to , but big us tech companies do n't want to pay taxes in europe so for what resources we can build it ? 
  i can understand it slightly . 
  most foreigners live in prague and as is typical for capitals , people there are more reserved compared to smaller cities . 
  on the other hand , czech is more in need in regions . 
  well , you can always break our ice crust by being nice and starting the conversation ( pro tips : talking about pets , weather , monuments , culture , food . . ) . 
  no to : where to get drunk , where to find women , etc. 
  definitely do n't ask this people on the street - it 's annoying !, 
  indoeuropeans originated in pontic steppes, 
  not such big shock for me . 
  ok , prague is home for 12.4 % of czech population , so 14,2 % of country 's gdp is not such big advantage for the capital . 
  it 's an independent multinational business company , they all act in similar manner no matter of country of origin . 
  look at some dutch companies and their flower producing factories in africa , or how some european companies exported toxic waste to africa `` cos its cheaper '' , etc etc. 
  there are tons of such cases . 
  there is no ethic behind big money , only money can be heard . 
  pork was forbidden , because it caused contamination by trichinella spiralis and other parasites . 
  since , hygiene was n't on high level + the warm weather , it caused food poisoning quite often . 
  dogs were made forbidden , because they are very close to humans and they lick people as a gesture of love . 
  this was belived to be again source of transmission of some diseases on humans , which is not really true . 
  dogs as shepherds or for hunting were allowed , they were forbidden as pets because people would cuddle with them . 
  these beliefs were based on the fear from diseases , which was very common considering the mortality in those times . 
  is it something to be worried today ? , no . 
  if they knew , that cats can transmit toxoplasmosis , they might be forbidden as well . 
  instead , people saw cats keeping rats away ( rats causing food contamination + fleas ) . 
  monster, 
  i would add to all what have been said here , that many young people take year/two off after graduation for travel-and-work break . 
  they travel to their dream destinations and travel there + work for the travel costs . 
  i know many who had such period . 
  popular are australia , new zealand and canada . 
  one friend of mine who was fresh medicine graduate , traveled to canada , bought van and traveled on pan-american higway down to chile/argentina . 
  it took him 2 years ( he worked in between in various positions + he spent like half a year in costa rica ) . 
  russia acts for domestic audience . 
  nobody likes them ( generally speaking ) so their frustration turns into bullying to get some respect . 
  it 's a sad and well documented reaction + russians were not used to it during ussr ( they were the `` stars '' ) . 
  they wo n't grab the whole ukraine , that would be too much , but they will keep their actions in eastern ukraine as far as it will work for them . 
  the same goes for other places they are active currently ( syria , georgia , moldova ) . 
  putin knows the mentality of his folk , so as far he wants to be in the power , he will act this way . 
  four decades of communist utopia planning , isolationism and aggressive policies were definitely catastrophic for the businesses , which ceased to exist . 
  restart is a long journey and you ca n't beat western counterparts immediately , since they have four decades of advantages . 
  if north korea would have become democracy and they would return to the markets , they wo n't beat south korea in the economics for decades . 
  is it doable ? 
  sure it is , but it takes time . 
  we are 26 years since the return to the free world and many ex-commie countries are doing quite good actually . 
  next years and decades will bring even less of contrast . 
  the article is quite critical . 
  it says that saxony and brandenburg will catch up , so what 's left : mecklenburg-vorpommern , saxony-anhalt and thuringia . 
  saxony has big urban centers : leipzig , dresden and chemnitz and brandenburg has berlin in the middle . 
  the other states are more rural with the lowest pop . 
  density in germany . 
  it 's true , that they have suffered brain-drain in favor of western states . 
  they just need to attract young people to settle there and make it more easy for small businesses and inovators . 
  i think , that 's actually the opposite . 
  it happened at 3:36 am . 
  everyone in the inside of buildings asleep . 
  people could n't even react to it . 
  horrific, 
  i do n't know what 's the issue with this swimsuit ?

  hillarity ensued . 
  * czechs from other regions * - never know where to stand in the metro . 
  act like americans ( funny clothes , camera at the ready ) but speak czech . 
  eastern european cities hyped ? 
  never heard of such a thing . 
  i know some people have a hard-on for prague and budapest ( if that counts , no idea and i do n't really want to get into the '' * where eastern europe starts ? 
  * '' argument again ) , but not once i heard someone say '' * fuck yeah kiev what a place , man , that city has a soul * '', 
  somehow i 'm sure the mad scientist is an american ... 
  at school english is a mandatory secondary language and a subject that starts when you 're about 8-9 years old . 
  however to attain anything near fluency in the language , you 'll have to do it yourself mostly through exposure to the language , so : * music * shows / movies ( dub with subtitles ) * internet * i guess memes ( ? ), 
  no one really hires private tutors for their kids except for maybe some rich folks . 
  apocalypse would be great , finally i 'd have a chance to kill my neighbors and get away with it !, 
  so what i 'd be doing - i 'm by no way `` prepared '' for apocalypse , so i have no gasmasks , no survivalist gear , save for : * camping equipment and a sleeping bag * a machete * a large amount of tools * durable and reliable clothes / boots * a stockpile of various medicine * a guitar for cheeki breeki moments , stalker style * a bicycle ( needs no gas , suck on that , walking dead ) looking at the list it 's decent enough , but not to survive winters in central europe easily , so i 'd probably load up all the junk on my bike and ride southwards - specifically croatia . 
  no one would be looking at me weird or anything , just a survivor internationally riding on a city-bike with a guitar and a machete on his back . 
  croatia has some seriously desolated areas ( most of the inland ) , is warm enough in winter . 
  locals understand czech , so i they 'd understand what i want from them when i 'm robbing them . 
  also beaches are nice and using the guitar i could seduce survivor chicks . 
  eventually i 'd join a survivalist group and we 'd call ourselves something like ** `` the agency '' ** or ** `` children of the zone '' ** so it 's obvious we 're the bad guys and we 'd patiently wait for a bunch of all-american heroes to kill us and save the ~ ~ mselves ~ ~ day . 
  * edit : * i had a good laugh , thanks for the question op, 
  that 's rich coming from someone from a country where wilders is a thing . 
   ** all the eastern european countries ** has voted for right-wing-populistic politicians source or you 're full of crap . 
  we get two kinds of immigrants : ** the `` good '' ones ** ( russians , ukrainians , vietnamese , polish , germans , slovakians ) - in most cases they put an effort to learn , many achieve complete fluency ( and if not , their second generation does ) . 
  natives generally do n't mind them at all . 
  ** the `` bad '' ones ** ( americans , brits and other western nations ) - they ca n't speak czech for shit , because they live in a so called expat bubble , a style of life where they speak english at work and only hang out with other countrymen . 
  it 's kind of like living in a ghetto , except for they usually have high-income jobs . 
  as an emigrant , i have zero love or understanding for the latter . 
  show some respect and learn the language you cunts . 
  yeah we know it 's hard and no we wo n't give you crap for making mistakes and having an accent . 
  as far as i know he directly did not comment on it , but the presidential office spokesperson said that it was indeed `` flu '', 
  yeah he 's a drunk . 
  he did this notably once after being names president where there was a ceremony of viewing the ancient coronation items ( scepter , crown etc. ), 
  and he was swaying all over the place . 
  it was hillarious . 
  i present to you [ milos zeman ] ( https://i.cbc.ca/1.1376628.1378964989!/httpimage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/li-czech-electionrtr3czr3.jpg ) , the president of the czech republic !, 
  some similarities include : * anti-refugee , anti-islam * friends with putin * has a wife that does n't like to appear in public * has a hot daughter who likes to appear in public * '' * telling it like it is * '' rhetoric * fanbase consists mostly of lower social classes * hates the media , gets into regular skirmishes with them * calls his oponents names * makes up a lot of information , insists they are correct , refuses to apologize even when proven wrong * bonus edit ( thanks / u/edgar _ allan_pho ) * : * `` jokingly '' said that one way to deal with the prime minister ( whom he does n't like ) is with a kalashnikov . 
   if say , someone anywhere decided they liked your country 's culture , wanted to learn the language and move there , how many years would it take for the government to fully adopt them ? 
  if you may or may not come is another question that depends on if you qualify for a visa ( work/student/family reunion/entrepreneurship etc. ), 
  if you do qualify and move here and want to become a citizen there are basically three routes : * citizenship by descent - your ma or dad were czech , you can apply to become czech too . 
  in this case you do n't even need a visa , as you are a citizen . 
  * citizenship by marriage - see naturalisation , but sped up by cutting the year requirement down * citizenship by naturalisation - basically live here , pay taxes for several years ( 5 for outside eu , 3 for eu foreigners ) and prove * you 're integrated * - speak the language , do n't break law , know about the political system, 
  get woken up by alarm , fall down the stairs ( walking is hard when you get up ) into the living floor and the kitchen . 
  brush teeth , realize there is no time , pack breakfast with me . 
  realize there is no time for coffee either , blame trump for it . 
  realize there is no time to find matching clothes , put on whatever is closest by . 
  fall down four more floors ( this damn house has no elevator ) sit on bike , awkwardly cycle in a zig-zag manner to work . 
  have breakfast and corporate coffee , now i can function as a human being . 
  i 'd wait with this until the new community mod ( s ) are elected - then it 's safe to say there will be some changes , as to my understanding the new person/people will act as a channel between the community and the modteam . 
  ~ ~ might want to distinguish & sticky this comment , not everyone knows you 're the man running the show \\* wink \\* ~ ~ now done , but i still have my eye on you !, 
  1 - a highly skilled software engineer will have easy time getting a job pretty much anywhere in eu . 
  germany and ireland are the obvious choices , less obvious is prague and nordics . 
  2 - for you quite easy . 
  make sure to get employment with a company willing to sponsor your work visa ( so avoid startups and small companies ) 3 - it in the eu is doing pretty well . 
  good salaries , many job openings . 
  however job market is different in every european country , even region of a country . 
  a simple answer is not possible . 
  4 - / r/iwantout is a sub that specializes in migrating from country to country , a number of people there are americans in europe . 
   on a good day , a1 in german and mute on a bad day ?

  not very attractive , but if you want to see a politician get fucked instead of you getting fucked by politicians , she 's your best bet - because she did a whole lot of porn back in her day . 
  i love [ louis de fun\u00e8s ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/louis_de_fun%c3%a8s ) - i could watch movies with him over and over . 
  french comedy in general is extremely underrated . 
  poland - sexmission ( does anyone know where can i get it in english ? 
  ) , king size italy - [ fantozzi ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ugo_fantozzi ) movies germany - run lola run , der untergang , das boot , the lives of others , goodbye lenin , cobra 11 :d uk - does it even count ? 
  anything with simon pegg . 
  i kid you not , i read the post title and i immediately knew that op was / u/yeshitpostaccount i heard north korea were not big fans of trump , or americans in general for that matter . 
  for everyone else , it 's too early to say for sure . 
  it does n't matter what skin color , religion or politic affiliation you folks have , you 're all equally ( un ) pleasant . 
  yup . 
  it 's somewhat of a part of the `` pub culture '' , poor folk going to a cheap , shady pub and smoke a few . 
  the public reaction is divided , to say the least . 
  warm beer without a head, 
  okay this one really made me laugh . 
  * serious answer * : we do n't , and my guess it 's because : 1 . you can not buy an assault rifle 2 . you need a specific ( higher level ) licence for a shotgun and rifle 3 . the percent of gun owners in the population is so small that the gun sellers would lose money on any proper advertising . 
  living in germany . 
  pretty safe here , no idea about rapes . 
  ironically i feel more in danger by local xenophobes who get sometimes * really * pissed off if you do n't speak german in public or look different than `` standard '' .

  way too active . 
  what am i doing with my life ? 
  please send help . 
  let 's discuss this in modmail  8 . 
  i 'll make / r/askeurope ~ ~ great ~ ~ slavic again !, 
  depends heavily on context . 
  did i say some crap ? 
  was it uncalled for ? 
  was their comment racist or broke any rules ? 
  regular poster ? 
  slovenian poster ( you know whom i mean ) ? 
  those and many other factors contribute to whether banhammer or laugh it off . 
  when in doubt , check the rules .

  the problem is that while poles or hungarians are willing to compromise , brits not so much . 
  imho , it 's because eastern countries are less confident in their political views . 
  after all , democracy has been here only about 27 years . 
   do you really think that the uk is a worse fit for the eu than ( for instance ) bulgaria or romania ? 
  not sure , to be honest . 
  they are different economically , but i do n't really think that is a problem . 
  but yeah , the reason why i do n't think it is a big deal is because they do n't have a loud voice . 
  i mean , imagine if we accepted russia into eu . 
  that would cause a total havoc . 
  on the other hand , if we accepted a country like serbia , that would n't be a major problem . 
   the eu is ( and will for a very long time remain ) a bunch of nations with varying and competing national interests . 
  the idea , for me , is to do away with these varying interests and unify them to get a stronger , better europe . 
  idealistic ? 
  perhaps , but i still want it . 
  haha , keep believing it :p, 
  there were many opportunities to leave , or to descend into something like efta . 
   what you have to realise is that dissent and disagreement are healthy and crucial parts of democracy . 
  yes , that is true . 
  but the opinions must not be different too much , otherwise it does n't work . 
  the intersection of what uk considers good policy and what the rest of eu considers good policy is quite thin . 
  of course , there are problems in the rest of europe as well , you can see that especially recently , but it is not so bad as in the uk-eu case , imho . 
   that disagreement is not acceptable again , as i said above , you ca n't have two completely different governments and try to integrate them . 
  you could n't integrate russia with usa , because they disagree on too many issues . 
   we were right about schengen , we were right about the euro . 
  i disagree with you on schengen , but let 's not argue about that . 
  the thing about these policies is that we feel like they are essential for further european development . 
  you generally disagree , we generally do not . 
  yeah , i am fairly young ( 24 ) . 
  i know , but before the financial crisis , i was n't really paying attention to politics . 
  so i am not saying you never participated in eu issues , but yeah , i consider 8 years to be a very long time . 
   it should not be difficult to see why the uk wants different policies in terms of free movement of people to other countries you are right , it is not that difficult . 
  the `` why '' does n't really matter though . 
  the thing is just that you do n't really fit , that is all that really matters . 
  if you attempted to integrate countries like turkey or russia into eu , it would n't really work because they just do n't fit . 
  there might be good reasons for that , but that does n't really change anything . 
   a large amount of the uk would very much like to remain in the eu i would ultimately also like uk in the eu , but not with your current mentality . 
  again , that is not a bad thing . 
  and i am definitely not saying that you leaving is going to solve all european issues , far from that . 
  but yeah , i believe some problems will be solved and we will be able to focus on other issues . 
  you as people ? 
  definitely not . 
  i work with a lot of brits , you are great people . 
  i just believe your political opinions are incompatible with the rest of eu at the moment . 
  that could change in the future of course and i hope it will , but we are not there yet . 
  ok , but what do you want then ? 
  if you just want free trade , that can be arranged i am sure . 
  but having you in eu with political power where you do n't participate , only block everything you do n't like , what good is that ? 
  if you think eu is a flawed project , why to stay then ? 
  eu is not just about giving money . 
  not even close . 
  well , it 's not that . 
  it just seems to me you do n't really participate in this `` european '' project . 
  i rarely hear any opinion of uk on any european issue . 
  i hardly hear anything about immigration , greece debt , euro etc. 
  just talks about exit . 
  this is very weird imho , you are the third most populated country in eu , you have some goddamn power , but you just do n't use it at all . 
  it 's always just germany + france . 
  yep , to honest , it seems to me you have n't been a part of eu for a long time anyway . 
  yeah , i absolutely agree . 
  czechia sounds ridiculous . 
  i once had an argument with some activists about this ( yeah , it is a thing , there are activists who want the czech republic to be called czechia , see [ here ] ( http://www.go-czechia.cz/ ) ) , did n't go very well , they could n't understand i had a different opinion . 
  btw , the letter `` r '' in `` republic '' is capitalised in english . 
  cool !, 
  i have n't been at a zabijacka for a very loong time  ... 
  i think we czechs do n't do that much anymore . 
  it 's possible . 
  but i do n't think that is going to happen . 
  we have become much better at economics than we used to be . 
  financial crisis in 2008 would have been a disaster if we did n't know what to do to fix it . 
  the business cycle has ups and downs , exactly . 
  that 's why it is possible to even it out . 
   i see it as propping up the economy higher and higher while things get more and more expensive with no wage increases until it collaspes and we are all poor . 
  i do n't think that is happening . 
  the inflation has been kept at about 2 % annually for as long as i can remember and the wages has been rising faster than the inflation . 
  at least in my country . 
   spiral deflation is a thing , but so is spiral of lowering interests rates in hopes of keeping inflation up . 
  we 've been doing it for a few decades now . 
  well , the hope is that we will eventually need to push them back up . 
  we also use other approaches to fight deflation at zlb ( quantitative easing , foreign exchange intervention ) . 
   you do realize if you increase money supply , everyone becomes poorer , right ? 
  no , that is not entirely true . 
  if the demand for money increases and you increase the money supply , it evens out ( and nobody gets poorer ) . 
  you also have to consider the opportunity cost , i.e. 
  if the central bank does n't increase the money supply and the economy slips into a recession , you will be poorer than you would have been if they increased the money supply . 
   you are right , but at the same time when things are going unwell i dont see how continuing to lower interest rates indefinitely is solving anything . 
  in normal times , it is a great thing . 
  in our current times , i agree it is a bit controversial . 
  but i believe the tide will eventually turn and the interest rates will go up again . 
  if not , we might have to come up with another solution that keeps the economy running . 
   take the hit for the short term pain & long term gain is the way i see it . 
  maybe . 
  but i do n't think economists believe it is necessary , many central banks certainly do n't . 
  we do n't want under any circumstances another great depression if we can avoid it . 
  because deflation can cause a positive feedback loop ( deflationary spiral ) , i.e. 
  deflation itself causes more deflation ( deflation -  companies start making less money -  more unemployment -  people start saving money ( and spend less ) -  more deflation -  ... ) . 
  this makes the economy function far below its potential for no good reason . 
  the economy is not propped up on tax dollars if you increase money supply , you do n't use tax dollars for that . 
  i do n't think anyone would want the whole economy to `` burn down '' , not when there are people living in it ( unlike the example with the old forest ) . 
  they ca n't rip you off , if you wire transfer the money and they do n't give you the car you paid for , they go to prison . 
  of course no one would know and it is very unlikely someone would rob me .

  sudeten germans were more vocal and active nazi , den germans in reich . 
  and those few brave sudeten germans who put resistance against nazis in their own rows , had very sad end , by hands of their own minority . 
  the only difference between germans in bohemia and turks in germany is time they immigrated into their new land . 
  germans came on invitation of czech kings between 12 . and 14 . century . 
  turks came on invitation of german goverment some 60-50 years ago . 
  til just today i was reading some history esseys , and found out how widespread children `` handl '' agreements between czech and german families used to be here , in 19th centiry and also before wwii . 
  to get bilingual , families coming from different villages and towns would swap children for a year or two , or just for consecutive summer holidays . 
  some children on handl were as young as 4 , some were older like 17 . 
  in more bilingual areas , parents would just put their child for a few years into a german school and vice versa . 
  basing on what i could read , i guess at least 10 % of chilred experienced this , in some areas more like 60 - 80 % . 
  i guess , he means that many turks know some relatives or friends who are already living in the eu . 
  thus , it is pretty easy to get room and informal ( illegal ) employment after overstaying their 90 visa-free term . 
  no , it \u00b4 s not . 
  it \u00b4 s fun . 
  eu has visa waiver program for many countries - for example bosnia , serbia , moldova , mexico , most of south america , saudi arabia , malaysia , s.korea or taiwan . 
  i dont agree with turkey getting in it . 
  but i \u00b4 m not opposed to ukraine . 
  ah , ok , so this type of policy doesnt need eu approval . 
  thanks for info . 
  ukrainians are currently the largest minority in the czech republic , due to big gastarbeiter wave in between 2004 and 2009 , when czech goverment had very lax rules for work visa and our economy was booming . 
  practially every person from ukraine with at least secondary education and job contract got work visa back then , no questions asked , in under 6 weeks . 
  we got over 100.000 immigrants annually , without tensions or bigger problems , ukrainians fit into our society nicely . 
  but , very strict rules were implemented during the latest recession , and it \u00b4 s very hard to get work visa in our country now ( poland is a bit different , but even they offer only time-limited visa for 6-12 months ) . 
  what i was thinking about is opening our labour market for all ukrainians , under condition they have at least secondary education , lined job with salary at least 2/3 of our average ( to prohibit undecutting our wages ) . 
  they wouldnt need any visa . 
  they coud just come , sign a contract and then report themselves to local tax office , police and municipality . 
  you know , czech \u0160koda plant just signed a contract with its unions , adding 11,2 % on their wages ( before bonuses ) . 
  czechia has second lowest unemployment rate , only after germany , and czechs just refuse to move to other areas for jobs . 
  technical professions are hard to fill . 
  we is full . 
  but some eastern eu countries with growing economy are feeling labour force shortage these days ( poland , czechia ... ) . 
  maybe some sort of work-visa-waiver program could be allowed for ukrainians , that would be valid only for certain eu countries . 
  but i dont know if it \u00b4 s even possible under current eu rules . 
  you have wrong numbers for period 2000 - 2010 . 
  why ? 
  because it is obviously calculated based on total number of homicides and attempted homicides of \u010cr . 
  correct definition used for international comparison is number of dead bodies caused by homicide . 
  last decade , this number was around 0,7 - 1,0 for our country . 
  it is not crazy low . 
  it is very similar to germany and other we countries . 
  30 registered cases mean around 16 dead bodies ( based on long-term average percentage of completed and attempted homicides in czechia ) . 
  and this is only for 3 months . 
  calculated for whole year , it is around 64 victims . 
  it translates to 0,6 homicide per 100.000 inhabitans . 
  latest figure is 206 prisoners per 100.000 and it is growing . 
  many roma in slovakia will aswer that yes , they seek for a job . 
  actually , also ethnic slovaks in eastern part of slovakia have sky high unemployment . 
  borderlands around ukraine , be it east of slovakia , poland or hungary , is underdeveloped and fights with poverty and depopulation in last 25 years . 
  functioning association contract between eu and ukraine ( and getting ukr economy on its feet again ) would be very important for people there . 
  many countries show huge internal disparities , not only the uk . 
  prague suburbs had 2,5 % registered unemployment in march ( low season for construction and tourism ) . 
  prostitution itself is not prohibited and not regulated either . 
  pimping on the other hand is criminal offence that will land you in jail for some years . 
  brothels that mask themselves as bars , massage parlours etc. 
  exist . 
  as long as they dont overdo it ( forced prostitution etc. 
  ) , they are mostly ignored . 
  most girls work nowadays independent as excorts , often a few of them rent one flat together . 
  as a woman , i have no idea about prices etc. 
  recently , we talked a little about this thema with my colleage in office , who used to live near german border . 
  she sorta befriended one prostitute there who frequented their bar and asked her why she does what she does . 
  she replied that as a child , she was frequently raped by an uncle/family friend . 
  it made her unable to enjoy sex or keep a relationship . 
  when she was unable to find job for longer time , she decided to use her numbness and earn money this way , she had nothing to lose anyway . 
  if a person in prison or an illegal immigrant in detention centre has any money , it will be confiscated to pay the neccessarry expenses for its housing and feeding . 
  this is a law valid since at least one decade in the czech republic . 
  many european countries have similar laws , predating recent migrantion wave . 
  nothing new or shocking . 
  this is such a wrong step , unfair to many better countries that would more eligible for visa-free travel . 
  my country would never agree with it . 
  turkey has too much people overstaying their tourist visa , to grant visa-free entry . 
  but the eu let itself be blackmailed , once again . 
  germany can take them all , at least german laws allow for it , as long as refugees manage to illegally cross its borders . 
  but on the other hand . 
  you talk about european solution . 
  i quess you mean redistribution of refugees ? 
  tell me , which country is willing to accept significant number of them ? 
  why shouldnt it work ? 
  really , all you need to do is to issue short-term schengen visa , valid for transport to germany , for millions of refugees . 
  most will organize and pay for their trip themselves , lowcost airlines are everywhere . 
  i have heard there are currently around 60 million refugees woldwide and their number grows , both by new dispplacement and children born to refugees . 
  germany can have as much of them as it wishes . 
  germany is a suvereign country and can do what ever it wants . 
  german goverment is free to airlift ( or bring in boats ) as many millions refugees to germany as it wishes , or just issue visa for them so they can take a plan to berlin/frankfurt directly from turkey . 
  i dont think other eu countries will protest it , as long as they stay in germany . 
  czechs dont know anything about egyptians . 
  they dont come to our country . 
  the only contact is during vacations there , so people connect egypt with pyramids , all-inclusive hotels and red sea . 
  on the other hand , turks serve as bad stereotype . 
  if you want to insult somebody ( for being stupid or evil ) , you call him mongol , tatar or turek . 
  centuries of wars with turks ( ottomans ) , their slave raids and legendary brutality is simply part of our folklore . 
  i dont think it has much to do with erdogan ) as somebody else mentioned ) . 
  but turkey being mentioned almost daily in connection with migration/refugee crisis and isis doesnt help too . 
  actually , despite that czech survey saying otherwise , absolute majority of czechs are positive/neutral to jews . 
  czech jews are assimilated and practically invisible . 
  czechs and jews intermarry intensivelly since at least 19th century . 
  the czech republic is the most pro-israel country from the whole eu . 
  and with least antisemitism from all post-commie countries in europe . 
  [ read this to get some perspective . 
  ] ( http://forward.com/news/world/310921/walking-without-fear-in-europe/ ),

  it 's pure bully tactics , since they themselves do n't know whether what they 're doing complies with the eu legislation . 
   sure it can be seen as `` unfair '' to some that we 're still richer but who the hell would willingly give away more ? 
  i 'm not saying that you should give more to us . 
  i 'm just saying that the money you give to us are not charity donations . 
  the money that flows out of our economy back to the mother companies in the western europe are immensely more than what we get in the form of eu funds . 
  does that mean that those money would n't be flowing out of our economy if it was n't for the eu funds ? 
  no , of course not , that would still be happening . 
  at the same time , you really can not say that cee is giving you nothing back . 
  your companies profit massively on our markets . 
  all we ask for is that this is acknowledged - that the way things are set up is mutually beneficial for both sides . 
  we do not get charity from the western europe . 
  there is nothing like charity in international relations , except for perhaps cases of natural disasters . 
   even though that 's disproven by looking at growth rates i already said that the growth rates are misleading due to a different starting base and that the growth is very limited due to our economic model . 
  you apparently chose to totally ignore this point . 
   not only does this completely lack any gratitude it lacks gratitude , because we were n't aware that gratitude is part of the deal . 
  we though we were getting into a mutually beneficial agreement . 
  we 're not asking you for more money . 
  we 're simply asking you to stop using the funds as a tool of political blackmail . 
  edit to your edit : i already said that i do n't agree with what polish and hungarian governments are doing . 
  but as i said in another post in this thread - if the western europe was n't so confident that they can bully us around in regards of the refugee crisis , then maybe we would n't be seeing the problems we nowadays see in poland . 
  i get that when it comes to workers who work in france on long-term bases , but you also fine drivers which are only using france as a transfer country . 
  demanding that someone complies with french labour laws , when that person is merely delivering goods through your country seems unreasonable to me . 
   or it has been all along been the case and you just realize it . 
  yes , it was always like this . 
  and you 're right that i did n't realize this back then when we were joining the eu , but that 's because i was a kid when that was happening . 
  i only started to realize that this is what the reality is in the past few years . 
  the worst part is that everyone got so used to this , that nowadays it 's basically the norm in the western political discourse and to some extent in cee political discourse as well . 
  i see many people in my country saying basically stuff like `` well if do n't accept the quota system , then we ca n't be surprised that the eu will cut the funds . 
  it 's only logical that they do that '' . 
  in the western europe it 's obviously even worse . 
  i mean , even voices which are against cutting the funds are never using the argument that eu funds are part of the cohesion policy and so they should n't be tied to other policies . 
  instead they say stuff like `` well , i understand that it 's difficult to deal with those eastern europeans , but we do n't vote to provoke too much anti-eu sentiment there and we do n't want to look like we 're bullying them , we just should give them more time to grow out of the backwardness '' or some similar bullshit . 
  ok , so then why is macron talking about social dumping so much ? 
  allright , i 'm not going to pretend like i 'm familiar with the french public discourse more than french people  but i ca n't not notice that macron has been talking a lot about polish temporary workers in france and about cee truck drivers driving through france underming french truck companies and so on . 
  over here , france is seen as one of the most protectionist countries in the eu , since they try to fine our drivers who only drive through france on their way to the uk for not receiving french minimal salary ( which is something not even germany is doing , since the commission has not made it clear yet what is the correct way to deal with this issue and whether it 's legal to fine truck drivers for this ) . 
   now to be fair , refugees cost money and part of the eu is that we share the financial burdens , so in a way it makes sense . 
  they 're not asking for more money from us . 
  they 're asking us to accept a plan that is unacceptable for our voters and that does n't even work , because none of the refugees want to stay in cee countries . 
  both poland and the czech republic accepted refugees directly from the middle easte and the majority of them left to germany very quickly . 
  baltic countries are accepting refugees through the eu relocation programme , they 're leaving to germany as well . 
  if they asked us for a reasonable financial compensation , i would be ok with that . 
  but they 're not asking for that , they 're asking us to agree to something which is hugely politically unpopular in our countries and what does n't even work in reality and does n't address the roots of the issue at all . 
  all of the cries over the current polish government might have been spared , if only the eu was n't pushing so hard for the quota system . 
  the previous polish agreement agreed to it and lost the election and now we have pis in poland . 
  i 'm not saying that it is the sole reason why pis won the elections in poland , but it contributed to it . 
  without it , at the very least pis would n't have such a strong majority . 
   edit2 : after looking some more i found recent news about that the sanction procedures have been opened : http://www.euractiv.com/section/justice-home-affairs/news/eu-opens-sanctions-procedure-against-hungary-poland-and-czech-republic-over-refugees/ yes , those are the infringement procedures and they can end with fines . 
  but additionaly to that , some western politicians are also threatening us with cutting the eu funds for us , which are n't in any way tied to refugee policy at all . 
  for example schulz has been saying this repeatedly . 
  i said it in a reply to someone else , french voters might not care about v4 internal politics but they do care about cee workers in their countries . 
  thus i suspect some cee bashing the very least wo n't hurt macron at all . 
  the working class will like it because ` they take our jobs and drive our wages down ' and the urban elite will like it because ` those damn xenophobic racist eastern europeans ' . 
  agreeing with refugees quotas really is n't some essential eu value . 
  if you 're gon na threaten us with cuts of funds every time we disagree with some policy that you push for , then there 's really no point in having cohesion policy . 
  you might as well say it openly that for the funding you expect that we follow what you say . 
  look , i do n't expect the western europe to do more . 
  it would be absolutely naive to think that we will make convergence their top priority . 
  i would be fine if you just stopped threaten to cut all our eu funding over a disagreement about an unrelated policy . 
  that 's really all i 'm asking . 
  that you do n't act as if the eu funds give you some right to boss us around . 
  as for your proposal to not tax companies - i can not imagine how we would explain our citizens that we will tax their income , but the large corporations , mostly foreign-owned will be tax-free . 
  well what did you think it was ? 
  a bribe that was supposed to make sure that cee does whatever you say it should do ? 
  or a gift that will make sure that we 're grateful to you for eternity ? 
  the fund 's goal is to bring eu regions on a similar level , because the way the single market works , the more economically competitive areas have an advantage over those less economically competitive areas . 
  when we joined , the cohesion policy was already in place and convergence was a self-declared goal of the eu . 
  so excuse me for thinking that this goal was not conditioned on an agreement on other unrelated policies , like the refugee policies . 
  maybe they 're not aware of poland 's politics , but they are aware of polish workers in france working for lower wages , so i 'm sure some poland-bashing wo n't hurt macron at home . 
  poland and other cee countries have been growing from much smaller base so of course the growth rates look more impressive . 
  you 're right though that some catching up has been happening . 
  poland and other cee have been kept in imposed isolation before 89 and so the post-89 model that got us on european markets and was driven by cheap labour and foreign investments brought some quick benefits . 
  in the long term though this model has its limitation and simply does n't have a chance to bring us to the we level . 
  if you want to see that in practice , just look at the most developed country in cee in terms of gdp ppp per capita - the czech republic . 
  we 're currenly hitting the limits of the model . 
  we have full employment , exports go great , the economy overall is doing fine , yet we reach 2-3 % growth . 
  this simply is n't enough to close the gap , even though currently we 're basically at our highest potentional . 
  other cee countries will soon hit the limits as well . 
  in theory the eu funds should help us with transforming our economic model by investing more into education , research and development , however as we can see from the real life on the example of the southern europe , not even the eu funds guarantee that this will happen . 
   may i remind you the state of most of the region when it was under communist influence ? 
  they were no market to dominate , the east was immensely lagging behind and it is still lagging behind . 
  you do n't have to remind me that in the 90s , the cee markets were in an uncompetitive stage and that this gap has n't been fully closed until today . 
  i 'm perfectly aware of that and i was n't denying any of that . 
   and anyway , i think that without the eu and its funds , your markets would 've grow more slowly , and the west would 've dominated them anyway . 
  i do n't think any individual country in the east would 've been powerful / in a good enough shape to be more competitive than germany , the uk or france . 
  i completely agree with that . 
  i was n't saying that without joining the eu and without the eu funds , we would be in a better situation . 
  the eu single market is a mutually beneficial agreement . 
  when cee joined , everyone profited from it , both the old and the new member states . 
  the old member states got an unrestricted access to markets which at that point were uncompetitive in all the important high-added value sectors of the economy . 
  cee on the other hand got to use their comparative advantage , which was basically the cheap labour and was able to boost their economic growth by foreign investment . 
  only in the long term , this arrangement does n't create convergence . 
  the free trade itself is n't helping poorer regions catching up with western regions . 
  instead it helps everyone to profit , only the economically more developed areas profit more than the less developed areas because they control the sectors of the economy that bring the most added-value . 
  this is why cohesion policy exists within the eu - it 's supposed to help close the gap and bring the regions on a similar level . 
  and the eu funds are the tool of the cohesion policy . 
  my entire point is that eu funds are not a gift , they 're not some donation that we are supposed to be grateful for . 
  they 're simply a tool of a policy that everyone in the eu agreed was a common goal . 
  or so we thought . 
  that 's why we are frustrated to hear that the funds are suddenly used as a tool of political pressure . 
  they were not supposed to be conditioned on agreement with policies unrelated to the funds .

  make moravia great again, 
  mmga !, 
  i know what you mean but sudet germans recently gave up on retrieving land and what not . 
  bohemia can into germany , moravia can into austria and silesia into poland . 
   it 's all cultural in my opinion . 
  i agree . 
   we must somehow try to encourage change when these situations are present , by giving incentives so people benefit from working , and consolidating an economy in the region . 
  you mean like pay for labour ? 
  i beg to differ just because i can not fathom that africa is without opportunities . 
  i refuse to believe that black people in the us do not have any opportunities in biggest economy on our planet . 
  i can not believe that czech living in the north of bohemia do not have the opportunity to move a few towns south and get a job . 
  i just believe that people are different , and if there exist people who want to work , there must also exist people who do not want to work and as long as they get by on just the minimum , they are happy . 
  destruction of conservative values , such as religion or pride , and forcing the people to eat up equality and what not . 
  nah , the problem is when the people do n't want to work . 
  they were always doing worse , it is n't even a hundred years since they became a real country , let alone functioning one . 
  if only there was a large group of young men who could take up those jobs . 
  czechia can into germany ? 
  no , i absolutely agree . 
  if they were good people , they would rebuild their country at least 5 times now . 
  at last , we shall be all equal . 
  you do n't get it , we have to get them into our neighbourhoods , only then will they finally integrate . 
  if we can have cultural marxism , why not porn ? 
   they cant get simple shit done it 's not like national governments can, 
  step 1 . 
  stop running the government as a corporation step 2 . 
  tell the politicians to fuck off already if you do n't trust them seriously , i find it extremely absurd how we do n't trust our politicians one bit and still keep giving them money and still voting them in . 
  no problem, 
  ~ ~ i am not sure if you are any better given that you have the need to insult me based on my ideology . ~ ~ apparently a joke, 
  anarcho capitalism , best capitalism, 
  there we go , even better !, 
  if they ca n't track , what goes through the cable , how can they know , whether the cable needs an upgrade ? 
  i do n't think that up until this year , it was worth it to let the koruna float freely and risk deflationary spiral to get better jobs . 
  more importantly , i think czech people should stop trying to solve the cnb and instead pressure the politicians instead because the people in cnb are far more qualified to do their jobs than any politician theirs . 
  that makes sense but i am not sure how to improve this , really . 
  do you have any idea ? 
  is n't he complaining that czechs are not as rich as germans ? 
  from wikipedia , in nominal dollars , the german one is 10 $ / hour and the czech one 2.6 $ / hour . . 
  correct me if i am wrong but is n't the german minimum wage 5 times higher ? 
  https://www.cnb.cz/en/faq/the_exchange_rate_commitment.html#3 they trade on the forex markets like everyone else and if you happened to be buying czk at the same time , you could have bought some of it . 
  i find it very interesting that we elected a potential autocrat but we believe in our democracy . 
  you think that there is a small group of people/one person that own 50 % of our gdp in czk ? 
  economists would rather preserve financial institutions because some of them are very important to the markets than leave the whole thing collapse because of `` principle '' . 
  the abstract is enough but i can try and find you different evidence, 
  yea , if you put it like this , then you are correct . 
  trying to max out pareto efficiency is not flawed , it is not perfect but you have to make sure that the working class has enough human capital to move above cheap labour from ee . 
  i do n't want to devalue your comment but i think you are replying to a different idea . 
  you are obviously right in that free trade creates issues for the working class , however , i think it is wrong to blame the free trade itself because it also carries a lot of benefits for the working class . 
  the only people , who should be blamed are the people who , for example , insist on paid universities or other further education that would actually help the poor gain the jobs that foreigners ca n't . 
  http://www.nber.org/papers/w21123  this effect can attenuate downward pressure from immigrants on non-immigrants ' wages , and also benefit non-immigrants by increasing the variety of local services available . 
  for this reason , immigrants can raise native workers ' real wages , and each immigrant could create more than one job . 
  yeah , i hope we get a transitional agreement . 
  i will need around 2 months extra to finish my bachelors degree . 
  if i am lucky , i might finish masters . 
  czechia allows dual citizenship, 
   wage depression evidence is required, 
  finland entered the eu in three years . 
  yeah , it is probably because turkey is such a large country it would diminish the role of france and germany . 
  juncker drunk as usual , nothing to see here . 
  they know what they typed, 
  it depends , human transport in czechia loses money for czech railways but cargo transport always makes a profit . 
  you better not use this argument in czechia, 
  the idea that snp is holding continuous referendums is bad . 
  they clearly stated that if something drastic , such as leaving the eu , happens , they will want a new referendum . 
  but they also said that if something very important changes , they will call for another referendum . 
  if those policies were not effective , germans would not tell us to enact them . 
  that does n't convince me , really . 
  for example , czech republic follows germany in everything and would be grouped into balkaneast , same thing probably goes for slovakia and maybe hungary and poland . 
  not to mention the gap between central european countries and romania . 
  are your tiers definitive ? 
  they do n't make much sense , to be honest . 
  nordics should have their tier , german supply chain should have its tier and then maybe a tier for med countries . 
  i think the clerk guy is bullshitting . 
  you ca n't survive with 400 per month in prague . 
  red riding hood : siberian edition, 
  are you telling me that poles can move from a eastern european shithole to britain but britons , with their superior buying power and superior everything , ca n't just hop across the channel to the netherlands or something ? 
  i do n't mind, 
  our media usually reports the failures of our politicians to actually take money from the eu . 
  what happens to the exports to the ruk though ? 
  i know that czechia exports almost everything to germany but from there , it leaves to the rest of the world . 
   go full modernist if the place does n't have a real architectural value pls , tell this to the council of aberdeen , they insist on everything being gray, 
  how about greece in the middle ? 
  he does not want to do something new because he does n't have to . 
  free trade and pareto improvements solve everything . 
  i think macron is the best because he actually understands contemporary economics . 
  contrary to general opinion , mainstream econ is very syncretic and ready to assist people . 
  if anyone is going to prevent him from actually improving the society , it will be the french parliament pandering to voters . 
  czechia can finally into germany, 
   so a pareto improvement would mean to allocate more state support to those who were economically and socially disadvantaged by neoliberal policies after 1980 ? 
  yes , i did not tell the whole story . 
  as many people these days say , free trade does disadvantage the poor people , however , it makes the society as a whole better off , this is in economic jargon called kaldor-hicks improvement . 
  this is where the pareto improv . 
  comes in and is supposed to change the inequality . 
  obviously , it wo n't be 100 % effective because this the real world . 
  also , mainstream economics today is working under a unified model , meaning that as long as you have solid evidence , the theory is accepted . 
  and krugman and stiglitz are considered brilliant economists but leftist hacks . 
  i do apologize for my social difficulties but you are criticizing my comment , right ? 
  so you are saying that varoufakis has a hunch that ecb acted politically ? 
  do you have anyone backing this up or evidence ? 
  for example , when bernanke was trying to make the fed more transparent and tried to talk to the media what is going on , he moved the markets . 
  releasing the minutes of their internal meetings could have unforeseen consequences .

it has literally zero to do with disagreeing views , it has everything to do with his views being ridiculous and based on lies . 
  he might as well claim hitler was a good guy and you might label it `` controversial '' and urge me to listen to other points of view and debate it , but it would be just as ridiculous . 
   being smart means thinking things through . 
  it means trying to find the real answer did i reach the tv esoterics channel ? 
  i just did think things through , moreover where chomsky did n't . 
  i pointed out in specific terms step by step what 's stupid about him and the idiotic results his thinking produces . 
  chomsky is an idiot who started his career adoring mao and defending khmer rouge and nowadays , even after invasion of ukraine , genocide in kosovo and bosnia , he is being real smart asking himself deep and meaningful questions , such as why nato never disbanded . 
  he then comes up with deep and meaningful answers about how it 's become a tool of global domination seeking to subdue all those super important energy sources that we know are many in the balkans . 
  com/news/203055-us-russia - war-chomsky / he is of course very bright to point out in the course of the article that us anti-isis coalition is very meaningless apart from mosul being conquered today and raqqa being conquered as we speak right now . 
  he also spreads the lie that nato promised the soviets to never expand eastwards on the basis of talks surrounding reunification of germany , when in fact poland , czechoslovakia , hungary etc. 
  were never discussed , and he frames the expansion of nato as a criminal act by bill clinton when it 's really been a successful own aspiration of free and sovereign peoples .

  he will do absolutely anything for them . 
  they say `` jump '' and chomsky instantly starts jumping . 
  what sort of result do you expect from russian investigators in a political case ? 
  the source being ramzan kadyrov , allegedly . 
   according to our information , the detainees were shot that night and have been carried to various cemeteries , including christian , and buried in hastily dug graves ( some burial sites are known to `` novaya gazeta '' ) . 
  thank you , i am aware enough of russian propagandist version of reality already , and i find it ridiculous . 
  so then according to meduza the allegation was made by kadyrov . 
  we can also just not listen to liars . 
  also , chomsky is an idiot . 
  from the report :  according to our information , the detainees were shot that night and have been carried to various cemeteries , including christian , and buried in hastily dug graves ( some burial sites are known to `` novaya gazeta '' ) . 
   do you think this average person will feel about these two pieces of news differently ? 
  yes , which is probably why you are making things up . 
  the novaya gazeta report says nothing about any isis allegations . 
  victims were also buried at a christian cemetery . 
  the novaya gazeta report did not say that . 
  which report said this ? 
   according to our information , the detainees were shot that night and have been carried to various cemeteries , including christian , and buried in hastily dug graves ( some burial sites are known to `` novaya gazeta '' ) . 
  christian isis , okay . 
  listening to liars for multiple points of view is a folly . 
  what a majestic creature , what has the world come to . 
  you will have to find a way to engage with actual politics , as all great movements and people have done in spite of personal antipathies and distastes , for the sake greater glory and goodness , or else you might as well be stuck with orb\u00e1n forever . 
  join an opposition party and help remove the establishment . 
  clearly we should have governments arbitrarily shut down all universities teaching social sciences because of your preconceptions . 
   p.s. 
  foreseeing all of the comments : yes , they pay me $ 68 per day for shilling on reddit !, 
  quite imaginable . 
  it 's not necessarily our job , but i am saying what helps if you want to help fgm victims in the first place , rather than bash immigrants and foreign nationalities . 
  their relatives are the ones who can have their mind changed ( this is n't a far stretch ) and can be prevented from doing so by the threat of repression not only to a particular girl , but to many more . 
  moreover they can then exert influence on other as of yet uninformed people . 
  i am a little surprised by the downvotes . 
  his foundation supports all sorts of social causes , and i think the `` political activism '' term is debatable . 
  in my mind `` political activism '' can only apply as a result of primarily an engagement in social issues , which is the core focus of his foundation . 
  more importantly in the regimes that hate him the most he 's engaging in little more than a support for general open governance and civic participation . 
  i would strongly recommend making one 's opinion for oneself : https://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/, 
  so , just to reiterate : if you are getting a ware from an immigrant , especially someone who has received asylum or international protection : chances are he has been upon immigration informed about the detrimental effects of fgm , is aware that it is illegal , while on the other hand his daughter is protected by law , is informed about her rights , and most importantly of all receives regular medical check-ups . 
  all of which are reasons why this phenomenon is much rarer in european immigration populations than in their respective home countries . 
  if you want to protect women from fgm , there is no better way to do it than to give them all the support , education and protection of the european countries . 
  the same applies to their relatives , families and offspring . 
  newly recorded cases are not the same as `` new cases '' . 
  but ... that 's what he 's done . 
  sometimes this works in advancing their interests also because you accept their seemingly reasonable premise , as surely ordinary people scarcely tell things with no substance . 
  a very poor country of hospitable and friendly laid back people who are a more natural part of europe than outsiders realise . 
  underdog with a big potential . 
  captures the spirit of the place well . 
  the last couple of articles look like someone was trying to hastily fulfil their quota in a troll factory . 
   why are six u.s. 
  senators bolstering thugs in the balkans ? 
  an opinion article saying the macedonian government is illegally pressuring us aid and a local macedonian civic organisation , which happens to be funded by open society foundation , which has received its endowment money from soros . 
  are we supposed to be rooting for the said thugs and people throwing rocks at civic activists or ... ? 
   soros outlines ideas for reconstruction , regional-aid package for the balkans eighteen years old article behind a paywall . 
  but i am glad that as far back as in 1999 george soros has committed himself to the betterment of life in war struck balkans . 
   `` the u.s. government has quietly spent millions of taxpayer dollars to destabilize the democratically elected , center-right government in macedonia by colluding with left-wing billionaire philanthropist george soros . '' washington times writer says that judicial watch say that macedonian ruling party says ... that youth engagement support is somehow undermining the government . 
  presumably by holding openly accessible seminars on how citizens can participate in it . 
  i am sorry , but clearly government of macedonia or any country is a property of no party and belongs to its citizens . 
   macedonia to george soros and usaid : go away suddenly the `` six thugs '' from the original article are now the good guys who we can take at their word . 
  what it really means is : `` macedonian ruling party to usaid and a macedonian civil organisation : go away '', 
  sure you can , there 's whole organisations of people , making a living manufacturing internet content like that and yet many more people that have been duped . 
  but that does n't mean its true . 
  just how gullible and misinformed do you have to be that you would think anyone proposes settling * illegal * immigrants anywhere ? 
  to think this is completely seriously proposed by hungarian government on national television at expense of the taxpayers . 
  the only reason why there 's so much hate towards soros is because his liberal conviction , furthered quite gently by financing civil organisations , movements and even public services ( eg . 
  financing of russian libraries and higher education ) is stepping on toes of the most ridiculous governments and government agendas . 
  russia hates him the most and spent a lot of its resources working him out to be a boogeyman , it 's shame that formerly sattelite european countries are now buying into it . 
  though they 're not alone , the american right plays the useful idiots quite willingly too , because democracy in eastern europe is not as important as random social issue bickering in the us . 
  i am suggesting that soros has not wielded manipulative , coercive power over states in the past . 
  somehow , the hungarian video is not about currency speculation though , is it ? 
  the reason why you really hate soros is because he bolsters liberal civil societies and that 's about it . 
  very good, 
  actually what is happening is that all regulations have a grandfathering clause meaning you ca n't use the gun , even though you can own it . 
  but why , why would you possibly want to restrict people from having things made by their labour , like dirty bombs ? 
  did they not work on them ? 
  oh the inhumanity . 
   and those crimes would n't be commited if guns were n't legal ? 
  those crimes would be significantly harder to commit if the guns were n't legal . 
  or are you suggesting that criminals take the trouble to acquire guns because it 's making things worse for them ? 
   and switzerland restrict availability heavily ? 
  is that why they have one weapon for every 4 citizen ? 
  because those are military firearms for which they do not have ammunition at home . 
   and also , for every firearm related homicide in usa , there are 37 000 guns . 
  1 174 370 serious crime incidents took place with firearms in 2013 . 
  there 's 192\u00a0000\u00a0000 privately owned firearms in the us . 
  but i will let everyone be the judge of whether us has a gun crime problem or not . 
  and of course whether 235 000 self defense uses over a * five year * period fully compensates the risks of private gun ownership . 
  firearms for regular citizens in the us are used seven times more to commit crime with firearm than self-defensive behaviour , according to these two surveys : https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/cv14.pdf https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/fv9311.pdf  usa have many weapons , yes , but so does switzerland , finland and sweden finland does not recognise self-defense as a valid reason to own a gun , switzerland heavily restricts their availability in private capacity : http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-21379912 numerous other factors contribute to or decrease crime for sure , but guns contribute more to insecurity . 
  why do n't we then make owning dynamite , cyanide and dirty nuclear bombs a constitutional right , considering all those might come from the result of your labour ? 
  knives , axes , hammers and shovels are not primarily made for killing people , and have a significant conventional utility outside of the area . 
   and in usa , people are n't shot with legal guns anyway according to survey of bureau of justice , most inmates in 1997 either purchased the gun , or obtained it from family or friend . 
  minority bought the weapon off the street and just 9,9 % stole it .

  i think the joke was fine . 
  it was good , it was the top comment , but some of the mods are [ * censored * ] . 
  it 's just a joke ... 
  prejudice is just statistics in a way ... 
  they just have weird definitions of racism . 
  no , justice is when people who commit crimes are punished . 
  in this case , some guys from north africa were sexually attacking women , that 's pretty much certain . 
  there are no video recordings identifying the attackers ( i assume ) , therefore no useful proof , so there will be no justice . 
  yeah , they wo n't get any sentence , that 's what i meant . 
  they might get some unofficial justice ( unlikely ) . 
  i do n't get your point or how it 's related to my comment ... 
  it 's simple , there are no proofs , there will be no justice . 
  it was obvious they wo n't convict ( almost ) nobody . 
  unless you have a video recording , you ca n't prove it ( usually ) . 
  i sleep and reddit , that 's not nothing ... 
  lol so true . 
  source : i 'm lazy and czech . 
  interesting thing is that polish and ukrainian name for april is closely related the czech name for may ( kv\u011bten ) . 
  too much risk for little gain , it 's even hard to imagine what narrative would they want to spread . 
  btw , china uses paid internet commenters extensively within the chinese internet . 
  yes . 
   it 's about both . 
  the lower number of re-launches you build the higher the costs . 
  ok , agree with that . 
   first of all : they are already competitive , as i said earlier on . 
  well , depends on how you define competitive . 
  yes , they can win contracts but overall / on average , spacex simply offers a lower price . 
   secondly : they do cut prices . 
  already with ariane 5 and soon with ariane 6 . 
  in fact a64 has lower advertised price per kilogram than both : falcon 9 and falcon heavy . 
  according to wiki , a64 has a projected cost of $ 96m / 11000kg = $ 8727/kg compared to falcon 9 's $ 62m / 8300kg = $ 7470/kg . 
  plus , the next version of f9 will have better manufacturability ( lower price ) and higher thrust ( more payload ) . 
  and reusability might push the price down even more by a little , but that 's just speculation based on unofficial gto payload estimates and 30 % price cut . 
   it wo n't be cheaper only if you assume high volume of flights . 
  in low volume , as all the current trends are showing , it 's definitely going to be cheaper than re-using the entire first stage . 
  ( hence why spacex is creating its satellite constellation - they need high number of launches to make the whole system profitable , otherwise it makes no sense ) . 
  not sure i understand your point correctly , but it 's about number of reuses per first stage , not absolute volume . 
   for small sats the price is the same , for large sats spacex got the edge do you have the source for this ? 
  i 've just did a quick research and spacex seems to have significantly lower prices . 
   and so in 2016 arianespace beaten spacex in a market share for a new contracts signed , just like it did in 2015 . 
  i think spacex is supply-limited , not demand-limited , they 're just not able to launch quickly enough . 
  if i recall correctly , spacex already had more launches than arianespace in 2016 and they want to do 3x of that in 2017 . 
   considering that falcon 9 reusability cuts prices by 30 % - it 's right on the spot . 
  well , arianespace needs to cut cost down more to be competetive . 
  it 's too little too late . 
  when / if it 's finished some time after 2020 , spacex will be reflying their falcon 9 and falcon heavy rockets regularly , blue origin might be reflying their heavy launch rocket ... it will be very tough to compete on that market , even more than today . 
  ed __ is right , the system wo n't be cheaper . 
  spacex is significantly cheaper even without reusability . 
  adeline is expected to cut flight cost only by 20 to 30 % , not enough to be competitive with spacex . 
  also , adeline is in its early stages of development . 
  honestly , arianespace ( or pretty much any spacex competitor ) is in a tough place , it 's pretty much impossible to compete on price with spacex . 
  yes , economic sanctions are working . 
  we are allied with him , the problem is he might damage the partnership by criticizing merkel and the eu instead of russia 's involment in ukraine . 
  it 's not black and white but yes , you could consider russia and trump 's administration our enemies . 
  russia wants eu breakup . 
  bannon and probably trump too . 
  by agreeing with putin on every matter for some reason . 
  this makes him a threat to eu unity and to ukraine . 
  possibly even to the safety of baltic states . 
  trade, 
  what do you mean for example ? 
  i guess i interpreted your comment incorrectly . 
  the good thing is that eu has a bigger economy . 
  stopping trade altogether would be bad for the eu but horrible for russia . 
  i feel you man , this really sucks : / i hope eu will pressure russia to back the fuck off . 
  are you serious , you do n't see the difference between the us and russia ? 
  what makes russia different from a country like italy is : - their willingness ( and ability ) to intervene in other countries , stemming from their superpower ambitions . 
  russia is very power-hungry . 
  look at ukraine , syria , georgia . 
  or their extensive spy network and propaganda operations in eastern europe and beyond . 
  they even helped to elect a an american president whom they can to some extent manipulate . 
  russia also supports anti-eu parties across europe because they do n't want european unity , it goes against their imperial ambitions . 
  - authoritarian form of government , which has its advantages . 
  putin does n't have to play by the rules , he can do much more than the public would allow their leaders in democracies . 
  it 's not hugely inaccurate to say he 's the dictator of russia , he controls the media , government , etc. 
  - military . 
  exactly , what a wasted opportunity . 
  it is , you just need to think about it a little more . 
  ok , but i 'm sceptical even of that . 
  is it really the optimal way to spend the money ? 
  why not put it into nanotechnology and biology research ? 
  what are the returns to wider economy of sending a probe to mars ? 
  in general yes , but that 's not what i 'm arguing - that the `` investing in space is a great r&d investment '' argument does n't sound convincing at all . 
  honestly , i do n't know , i just feel like replying a lot today . 
  there 's no hidden meaning behind it . 
  well , what i really meant is that this `` return to wider economy '' argument is probably to some extent bs , which should be evident if you read the article and thought a bit about it . 
  yes , it 's obviously just my opinion . 
  i 'm generally a fan and follower of space programs , it 's only that i 'm sceptical of the ` new space technology is also useful on earth ' argument . 
  agree , i actually support the space program for a bunch of reasons . 
  but i 'm just sceptical of the `` it 's a profitable r&d program '' argument . 
  yeah , i replied to it . 
  honestly , i do n't find that convincing at all . 
  it 's not a return on investment but `` return to wider economy '' , whatever that means . 
   the induced revenues account for the increased spending that results from the industry 's existence ; for example , a space engineer 's increased spending on goods and services . 
  yeah , but this would be true even if those engineers received the money without doing anything at all . 
  ok , give me a link clearly showing that esa has a high roi . 
  that 's nothing but speculation , it 's just something people always say without thinking whether it 's true . 
  my guess is that space research does n't have an especially good return on investment . 
  and that 's coming from someone who supports space programs . 
  well , i did .

fuck , i should move to finland . 
  how 's the internet over there ? 
  that 's amazing . 
  seriously , what 's up with the pom-bear ? 
   comments made on facebook by an extremist politician sounds like an official and newsworthy statement . 
  yeah , pretty much what fleg said . 
  according to [ this ] ( http://www.ptejteseknihovny.cz/dotazy/slovo-nemec-etymologie ) , in the past the word `` n\u011bm\u00fd '' ( mute ) did n't only mean , well , mute people , but also people speaking unintelligibly , so generally foreigners . 
  in slavic countries , the foreigners we 're mostly germans , thus the word `` n\u011bmec '', 
  wow , i 've never realized the origin of the name . 
  i seriously hope it does n't catch on . 
  sounds fucking stupid . 
  i live near a church and i 've lived near a mosque when i was in uk . 
  there 's a difference mate . 
  we 're a mostly atheistic country and accepting a shitton of muslims will inevitably be nothing but a step back . 
  dunno man , voting for a guy with tatoos just because he 's a guy with tatoos ... 
  yeah ? 
  what power is he grabbing exactly ? 
  oh yeah , because karel `` i fall asleep every ten minutes and nobody can understand what i 'm saying '' schwarzenberg is such much more fucking representative . 
  i 'm not saying i like the way he acts , but we did n't have much of a choice and more importantly , he does n't fucking matter anyway . 
   cars and computers are n't necessities , they 're luxury products . 
  yeah , no , that 's bullshit . 
  pls do n't, 
  and i did not say that was the case . 
  out of the two options he gave , the latter one was closer to the truth than the other one . 
  if that 's what you consider an extensive debate , then sure , i 'm wrong . 
  i do n't want it . 
  you can have it . 
  the latter, 
  how is it lame ? 
  what does that even mean ? 
  we 're pagans , infidels and we eat babies . 
  right . 
  1050 years ? 
  sounds like a good time to get over it, 
  looks alright . 
  i generally prefer my chocolate to have less nuts and fruit . 
  i do n't think i 've ever met someone who liked studentsk\u00e1 pe\u010de\u0165 before, 
  i suppose , but the bus stop having walls definitely helps, 
  haha , it 's not that rural , really . 
  and our bus service is pretty great . 
  it 's just a terrible bus stop . 
  i do n't really use it any more , but i had to when i went to high school and at six in the morning , during winter ... well , it 's not great . 
  still better than [ mine ] ( http://i.imgur.com/mwrcinj.png ), 
  yeah , i figured it was some kind of margarine, 
  yeah , we have a similar one . 
  our butter still comes wrapped in paper . 
   try not to get offended though yeah , i 'm not . 
  see ? 
  it 's easy . 
  maybe try not getting offended instead ? 
  we use `` mrska\u010dka '', 
   their target audience is low-income people from small towns and villages no , their target audience is morons . 
  bulgaria is n't a part of v4, 
  you 're either a troll or a moron . 
  or maybe both . 
  i might be weird , but that sounds great . 
  not the lizard thing ? 
  sure , and if there 's ever an alternative that does n't sound as stupid as czechia does , i 'll gladly use it . 
   not to mention the fact that many people do n't get that `` czech '' is an adjective i 'm sorry , but i do n't see how that 's our problem, 
  it sounds stupid ? 
  less fancy , but i 'll still take it over * czechia *, 
  yeah , i think the people here are the only czechs who like the name edit : well , them and zeman , according to wiki . 
  which is funny in its own way . 
  it 's just a couple more letters, 
  fancy . 
  we also deserve not being called czechia, 
  well , they did ban [ pomaz\u00e1nkov\u00e9 m\u00e1slo ... ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pomaz%c3%a1nkov%c3%a9_m%c3%a1slo ), 
  wow , this logic of yours is all kinds of fucked up . 
  mate , i love me some chicken , but if you think we kill animals to survive , you 're lying to yourself . 
  creepy, 
  hmm , balanced . 
  guess i 'm not using the good ol' excuse for why i do n't get any . 
  it 's really not that hard, 
  i know like two of these songs, 
   there are no really devoted followers to the religion of the flying spaghetti monster how dare you ? 
  yeah , that entire affair was annoying as hell too , i never said it was n't . 
  i 'm not sure i get what your point is . 
  hmm , the hysteria and media campaign surrounding a more or less innocent remark almost makes me wan na root for him . 
  yeah , it 's a bad joke , big fucking deal . 
  yeah , lets . 
  hope does die last after all . 
  yeah , it 's hardly perfect , but it would at least partially fill the hole . 
  yeah , well , except for new episodes of tv shows . 
  gon na have to wait for hulu i guess . 
  that might be the most accurate description of the situation so far, 
  dammit , why do n't we have a cool christmas goat ? 
  all we get is a stupid little baby . 
  i mean like 16 \u00b0 c or something , i hate hot weather probably more than i hate snow . 
  in my ideal world it 'd be 16 \u00b0 c all year round . 
  i , for one , am perfectly okay with it . 
  i 'd like it to be a little warmer though . 
  well , fuck . 
  sure , but schools are closed on thursday and friday , so this takes some pressure off parents figuring out what to do with their kids on friday , i guess . 
   february 22 ( gold in nagano ) wait , what ? 
   it comes as no surprise that this sudden `` adhering to christian traditions '' is a response to what goes on in europe right now . 
  that sounds like a bit of a stretch, 
  what the hell are you talking about ? 
  yeah , just another empty gesture so people can feel better about themselves . 
  how is the dutch way less efficient that the german way ? 
  i 'm pretty sure i was taught the dutch way at school , but apparently i was sick that day or something,

  [ what about 1veveryone ?

  it 's not that different from us . 
  they even successfully invaded russia . 
  in winter . 
  is it though ? 
  prussia is no more , prussian germans too , and prussian military culture died for good with ww2 . 
  polish victim complex is helluva drug . 
  it was extremely popular here about 10 years ago . 
  not so much now , but still now and then some tv station broadcasts it . 
  yeah , not sure what op is about here . 
  there is much larger proportion of people who do n't mind their oragans being used to save lives after their death . 
  the minority that does n't want to can opt out . 
  just to clarify , goosebumps are cause by invountary muscle contraction , not skin . 
  there are small muscles connected to every hair follicle , and cold causes them to contract , erecting the hair in process . 
  it is a relict from the time our ancestors had fur to keep them warm . 
  as for nipples , it 's pretty much the same thing . 
  there are muscle fibres that react to stimuli by contracting . 
  does n't matter wheter it 's low temperature or sexual excitement .

  as did pretty much all countries was of iron curtain . 
  welcome to slavic languages . 
  eastern european germans were descendants of those invited by local monarchs during middle ages to boost population and economy in underpopulated territories , either by war or disease . 
  that and the horrors of seeing your friends die one by one , combined with thorough propaganda on both sides , made soldier hate the other side too much to make this happen again . 
  it really depends on where you are bitten . 
  getting bitten in ankle vs in the face for example . 
  the latter 's progress is much faster , as the virus spreads via peripheral nerves into your central nervous system . 
  getting antitoxin serum as fast as possible after being bitten is really important regardless , though .

  honestly though , prague accent is the second most annoying way to speak czech i have ever heard . 
  it 's almost a national hobby here . 
  no permits needed , just go to the nearest forest and try your luck . 
  it 's quite similar to hungarians . 
  they are speaking an ugro-finnic language , but genetically , they have little in common with the 9th century invaders that brought it there , instead they are mostly descendants of population that had been already living in pannonia for centuries . 
  this happends when you bring swords to a cannon fight .

  show us ur tits bb,

  i do n't blame him in this .

  bacterial resistance is a real danger here , and we should avoid the over-use of antibiotics if an there is a viable alternative . 
  you need to czech yourself . 
  it does . 
  you just need to build more bunkers . 
  me too . 
  he 's lucky guy , unfortunately , fighting cancer is never over . 
  unless we see some actual source of these picture , i call bulshit on its results . 
  well , their success was mainly in the element of surprise , and the fact the majority of northern fighting men were to the south with robb stark . 
  even with that , they only managed to conquer and raid few coastal towns and settlements . 
  add to the fact that dornish are descendants rhoynar ( ? 
  ) , who were the lastest group to migrate to westeros , after andals . 
  it 's been a long time since i 've read the books , i start to forget which was which . 
  i might reread it in few decades , just in time for the winds of winter .

  this is something i do not understand : `` authority '' orders to jump down from a cliff and they did n't even consider other options ? 
  malta probably had no other choice but italy is n't small unimportant country which simply has to bend over every single time . 
  if lionshare means allowing growing hordes of unknown people to enter freely ... 
  if the final result will be collapse of italian society then what other word is fitting ? 
  international agreements are not something written in the sky , untouchable eternal truth to be followed to the last letter . 
  if you believe every twaddle there 's no hope for you . 
  italy or malta , as a way to offload consequences of their incompetence on someone else . 
  they talked about quotas years ago . 
  the main obligation of the society is to ensure its survival . 
  germans went crazy , once again , we are the sane ones . 
   politicians in central and eastern rurope are accountable to the people who elected them . 
  in the czech republic over 90 % people does n't want immigrants here . 
  this is something even the most traitorous politician needs to consider . 
  i have no doubt elites would sell us in a moment if we were not unified . 
  several years ( before ukraine ) ago i read that gazprom does n't plan to invest any more into the transit gas pipeline going through slovakia and the czech republic . 
  economy , ability to organize things , clean streets etc. 
  not as wanting germans to come here . 
  most of this is going to happen and not just in the czech republic . 
  imo the most realistic prediction of the future comes from [ stepan kotrba ] ( http://www.novarepublika.cz/2015/09/stepan-kotrba-masova-migrace-k-moci-se.html ) . 
  germany was very similar to what i was used to . 
  ireland felt as if from some other continent . 
  i am the type who does n't like change . 
  one austrian colleague had similar experience with britain . 
  many years ago i worked on some project in germany ( in aachen ) . 
  i really liked the place and how things worked well there . 
  i could imagine myself to live there ( unlike , say , ireland ) . 
  i also believe germany now tries to destruct itself once again , a double pity . 
  this call is pure pr for the locals . 
  while other top czech politicians still keep their head in sand he makes strong noises while actually doing nothing at all . 
  he is going to win the next elections being one eyed among the blind . 
  next to nobody here cares about the us ( when they do not screw up something badly ) . 
  germany is perceived as unattainable idol , except when it falls for some crazy ideology . 
  this pure pr for domestic consumption . 
  nobody cares what some guy from a small landlocked country thinks about ships . 
  he could do many useful things ( e.g close the borders ) but so far he did nothing . 
  more important are numbers of young males of military age . 
  progressive activists threaten to persecute people who disagree with their ideas . 
  they did recently the same in the czech republic . 
  ( i suspect it is coordinated campaign . ), 
  imo this is toothless , you can not throw everyone into jail and even couple of such attempts would backfire . 
   the eu has never been so sharply divided on an issue , not even on the greek bailouts . 
  slovak government fell down because of blackmailing from the eu , to pay the greeks . 
  good fence is necessary . 
  it is probably pan-european campaign . 
  two days ago czech state owned tv broadcasted similar brainwashing for kids , probably for the first time . 
  common european policy should be that germany takes them all . 
  no other country should be forced with this madness . 
   we do need to redistribute across the entire eu you invited them , the others did not . 
  you screwed up , your problem . 
  i wanted to point out to the op that canada can be very selective . 
  comparisons to current situation in europe are disingenious . 
  there were two waves of czech gypsies coming to canada , in 1997 and 2008 . 
  canada 's reaction both times was to establish very strict visa regime and deport all those who asked for asylum ( especially during the second wave ) . 
  they also changed tha laws to discourage further asylum requests . 
  it worked for several irish referenda . 
  in czech and slovak languages nouns * do not * have first letter uppercased , unless it happens to be the first word in sentence . 
  in czech and slovak languages nouns * do not * have first letter uppercased , unless it happens to be the first word in sentence . 
  canada deported undesirables like gypsies from the czech republic . 
  it happens to me when on lousy connection ( with chrome ) . 
  once i managed to generate three posts . 
  thanks , did n't notice this . 
  it was felt as something pressured upon us . 
  nobody cared about opinion of the people back then , no suprise they are all hostile to current blackmailing . 
  seeing your flag : i remember many weeks ago there was a spying scandal and pressure on the government to step down . 
  how did it end ? 
  back then people did post quite a few emotional appeals here but nobody bothered with some summary or `` post mortem '' . 
  yes , they repeated what they said on friday . 
  the czech pm guy [ repeated it once more today ] ( http://www.ceskenoviny.cz/news/zpravy/ec-failed-in-solving-migration-quotas-make-no-sense-czech-pm/1255977 ) . 
  czechs are practically unanimous against immigration ( a very rare phenomenon ) and politicians do not dare to go against this . 
  i do not push anything down one 's throat , i just do not wish to participate in something what i see as pure craziness . 
  most people happen to think the same . 
  you are free to help or whatever but please on your own . 
  poor country being flooded by aggressive hordes is not a win . 
  people who feel like you should not force their ideas on the others , instead they should pack up and go to help in person , instead of moralizing lectures . 
  this would be the real win-win situation . 
  well , it was not the czech republic who set up the system . 
  you could refuse but you did n't . 
  blame yourselves . 
  this involvement was deeply unpopular among the czech population . 
  what he said now is , however , shared by most of the czechs . 
  frex , in a recent poll 93 % people would deport refugees , only 6 % would allow them into europe . 
  suicidal pact is not perceived as solidarity . 
  you should fix your crazy ways , we are the sane ones . 
  is anyone preventing you to go to the middle east and spread the good ( tm ) everywhere ? 
  or do you rather wish other people pay money so * you * can feel good ? 
  there is something called food security . 
  unless you really believe in end of history ( tm ) and eternal summer without end ( tm ) you really do not wish to depend on unstable and/or hostile regions to deliver on your table . 
  today czech and slovak pms met with austrian pm . 
  they repeated they are against the quotas , austrian guy insisted on them . 
  there 's no law for national wide referendum in the czech republic . 
  politicians are too afraid . 
  czech politics is a mess . 
  traditional parties were discredited by never ending string of corruption scandals . 
  the real winner of last parliament elections was fan club of large oligarch , a party created out of nothing year before , with no prior political activity , even at local level . 
  it feels as if everything may happen , that nothing is predictable . 
  saying this : all relevant czech parties are against immigration . 
  some would close the borders , some are happy with words . 
  this tendency is undeniable and i see nothing reverting it in next few years . 
  just one example , a [ quote ] ( http://www.blisty.cz/art/78840.html ) by young communist euro mp :  there is no reason why the czech republic should bear responsibility for something it has not caused . 
  let the responsibility be born by the countries which have created chaos in the middle east .

  it 's not the job of the police to punish anyone .

  apparently some people are getting a paywall . 
  full text : at half past two in the morning a dozen people queue in the freezing cold to get in to tresor , a night club in a former power station in berlin . 
  in the sweaty , dimly lit interior , about 100 people are dancing to repetitive beats . 
  others sprawl on seats near the bar , clutching drinks or other people . 
  the club , one of the first places in germany to play techno music , seems as popular as when it was launched in 1991 . 
  but clubbing itself is on the wane . 
  after the fall of the berlin wall night clubs sprang up in that city in a moment of `` cultural anarchy '' , says dimitri hegemann , one of tresor 's founders . 
  they took over disused banks , warehouses and power plants . 
  in the rest of europe several `` superclubs '' had already opened in the 1980s , and more followed . 
  in london , fabric opened in 1999 in a former cold store ; in amsterdam , one started in a former print works . 
  smaller venues proliferated , too . 
  in this section apr\u00e8s charlie kabuki in the alps new year , new fear mezza mezza less than ecstatic early adopters reprints related topics arts , entertainment and media entertainment europe london united kingdom since then , however , the party seems to be winding down . 
  between 2001 and 2011 the number of discotheken in the netherlands fell by 38 % . 
  in britain there were 3,144 clubs in 2005 but only 1,733 ten years later , says the association of licensed multiple retailers ; in 2015 revenues were # 1.2 billion ( $ 1.7 billion ) , down from # 1.5 billion in 2010 . 
  in berlin , although the number of music venues has been stable at about 350 ( 120 of which are clubs ) , several long-established night spots have closed their doors . 
  partly this is because most european cities are becoming nicer to live in . 
  `` even in berlin it is harder to find an unused space in the inner city , '' sighs sven von th\u00fclen , a dj who has compiled an oral history of clubbing . 
  clubs are being pushed farther out . 
  increasing rents are also a problem , says lutz leichsenring of the club commission , a german industry body , especially in places such as london where property values have soared . 
  gentrification can muffle the high-decibel economy . 
  `` if there 's one complaint , then the whole circus starts , '' says eelko anceaux of de marktkantine , one of the handful of clubs that bucked the trend and opened in amsterdam in 2014 . 
  it is possible to build good relations with neighbours , he says ; his night club , like many new ones , doubles as a restaurant and hosts vintage markets , which makes it more acceptable to nearby yuppie families . 
  even so , middle-class residents ' complaints about noise and drunk or stoned revellers make the life of a club-owner far trickier . 
  as cities gentrify , local politicians are getting stricter about clubs . 
  madame jojo 's , a burlesque bar in london 's soho , had its licence revoked in 2014 after two bouncers brandished a baseball bat at a rowdy crowd . 
  in december the owners of fabric at last won a year-long court battle against islington council , the local borough , which wanted to introduce drug-sniffing dogs . 
  last year in berlin two clubs were closed down for fire-code violations . 
  increasingly , anyone who wants to open a club must have a business plan , says mr von th\u00fclen , rather than just an enthusiastic bunch of friends willing to party . 
  patience is also useful : it took mr anceaux four years to get his club open and another year to get a full licence . 
  this is boring . 
  let 's go to a gig two big social changes are squeezing club owners still further . 
  the first is that the youth of today are surprisingly abstemious . 
  in germany , britain , denmark and spain the use of mdma , or ecstasy , which makes bonding with strangers and dancing to repetitive thumping sounds far more enjoyable , has fallen among 15-34-year-olds ( see chart ) . 
  ( trends in the use of drugs less closely linked to clubbing , such as cannabis and cocaine , vary by country . ), 
  heavy alcohol consumption has also fallen slightly among young people . 
  excessive drinking in britain has seen a particular decline : between 2005 and 2013 the proportion of 16-24-year-olds who were frequent drinkers ( defined as drinking alcohol on five days in the previous week ) fell from 7 % to 2 % . 
  buying a drink in a club is `` really expensive '' , gripes amanda , a university student from america in london . 
  ( in certain clubs `` guys are douchebags '' , she adds . ), 
  the second trend is that big outdoor music festivals are replacing clubs . 
  in 2014 around 130 festivals took place in amsterdam alone . 
  in britain some 250 take place annually , up from 80 in 2004 . 
  many people are saving up to go to two big festivals a year , rather than clubbing each month , thinks iason chronis , a dj . 
  the economies of scale of big festivals , in which a captive audience splurges on food and drink , make it easier for festival organisers to book big djs such as calvin harris or jamie xx . 
  this , in turn , makes it harder for clubs to afford them . 
  the night mayor 's nightmares some cities are trying to halt the decline . 
  in 2002 , after a stricter pole-dancing law was introduced in amsterdam , the post of a voluntary `` night mayor '' was created to lobby on behalf of the night-time club and entertainment industry . 
  `` small events are like small business schools , '' claims mirik milan , a self-proclaimed `` rebel in a suit '' who has held the post of night mayor since 2014 . 
  in london last year a `` music venues task-force '' set up by the fun-loving mayor , boris johnson , recommended that local authorities should take a more `` balanced '' approach to dealing with noise and that a night mayor should be appointed . 
  in germany mr leichsenring of the club commission sits on a working group for the berlin chamber of commerce . 
  these night-time champions may be able to achieve better relations between governments , neighbourhoods and clubs . 
  but there is little they can do about the decline of 24-hour party people . 
  no paywall here . 
  ask for a mild heart attack . 
  also , i do n't really care if you were a mechanic . 
  my dad , my brother and two of my uncles still are mechanics , with about 150 years of experience between them . 
  * sigh * just google the word ` retorque ' .

   the strong euro also makes harder for germany to export outside the eu , but most german exports go to other eu countries where a strong euro is hurting their local manufacturing rivals . 
  well , you could say the opposite as well : `` the strong euro also makes harder for greece to export outside the eu , but most greek exports go to other eu countries where a strong euro is hurting their local manufacturing rivals . '', 
  by the way , after some googling it seems that the consensus is that cheap euro helps germany . 
  as for the california / mississippi case , what i was asking is , if usd goes up , will it help california more relatively to mississippi ? 
  thanks , what about the strong currency though , does it help germany and california and hurt greece and mississippi ? 
  why ? 
  yeah i know of course , but it 's a negligable amount . 
  well , the economics is absolutely key in this . 
  most arguments i 've seen here recently basically operate on an emotional , non-factual level ( `` hardline attitude '' , `` willing to compromise '' , `` demaging her view over here '' , `` uk is more on the fear side than the love side '' ) . 
  i think what 's missing in the whole mess is a more systematic approach and clearer thinking . 
  a tangentially related idea i 've been thinking about : when two parties are negotiating , a systematic way to look at the process is this . 
  you create a set of possible deals . 
  for every such deal , estimate how will it affect either party . 
  for example , deal d will have a +10 effect for the first party and +1 effect for the second one . 
  it 's a win-win deal , but the first party benefits way more . 
  the numbers are relative to the no-deal option , which has a 0 effect to both parties by definition . 
  the real question is , what deal is reasonable for both parties . 
  but even though there 's not an easy answer to that , the decision-making should be much clearer at this point . 
  so i think what 's needed when discussing the greece crisis is a set of possible solutions with estimated costs . 
  that 's something everyone should be able to agree on to some extent , it 's mostly economics . 
  you did n't ask about the czech republic but you 're getting the answer anyway . 
  as of may 2015 , 69 % are against the euro , 24 % are in favor . 
  really ? 
  we do n't :d, 
   for german exports to eu countries the strong euro helps germany and hurts countries like greece and spain why ? 
  does strong usd help californa and hurt mississipi ? 
  ( not rhetorical questions , genuinly curious . ), 
  a posible benefit of not having the euro is that you can set interest rate optimal to your economy . 
  ( correct me if i 'm wrong , i 'm not an economist . ), 
  what do you think she should have done differently ? 
  they clearly do n't understand the internet . 
  you do n't simply ban an internet community . 
   i hope germany will be less cooperative in the future . 
  germany basically gives out money all over the place while being accused of being nazis . 
  if merkel was a stronger leader ( inb4 hitler ) she would n't agree with this deal . 
  it just prolongs the agony , * it is n't helping anyone * , certainly not the greeks . 
   if we really want a united states of europe well , that 's the question . 
  are germans willing to send a percantage of their wage to greece ? 
  west germans are mostly ok with giving money to east germans but what about greece ? 
  i 'm sure greeks want a united states of europe . 
  not sure about germans or the dutch . 
  really good interview about the greek situation with one economist , in czech : http://video.aktualne.cz/dvtv/michl-recke-reformy-poslou-zemi-do-haje-dohoda-nepomohla/r~c6fb8934295611e5ae1b002590604f2e/ some of the main points : - this deal solves nothing , the greeks will want more money within a year . 
  - greece needs to find a recipe for growth . 
  rising taxes and cutting down expenses = the decline will continue . 
  - there are basically three paths : germany leaves the ez , greece leaves the ez , germany will regularly give money to greece , it will become an item in their budget . 
  i agree . 
  we 've tried pouring money to greece for 5 years , time to try something else . 
  oh really ? 
  oh do you ? 
  why , i like this sub overall , i 'm a long time cuntributor and most of my comments here are upvoted . 
  but i 'm back now , how you feel about that , eh ? 
  well maybe but at least i should have been told what rule i broke and banned instead of shadowbanned . 
  i was genuinly surprised that that kind of comment can result in a shadowban . 
  really ? 
  i take buddhism or christianity over islam any day . 
  i was shadowbanned for a similar comment . 
  yes , wtf . 
  i agree with the sentiment of your comment , i.e. 
  that : - the public debate about immigration is not very sophisticated . 
  - many of the immigrants really need our help . 
  - if we wo n't help them integrate , they might turn against us . 
  but that does n't change that i think we should be conservative accepting immigrants , for two reasons : - these immigrants ( from north africa ) will probably cost us money instead of helping the economy . 
  it 's not our duty to feed less fortunate people . 
  - there 's a risk of serious and hard to solve social problems . 
  yes , perhaps it 'll turn out fine but why risk it , if we end up with ghettos full of unemployed ( children of ) immigrants , you ca n't reverse the decision to accept them . 
  your typical muslim immigrant has a bit different mentality than what we 're used to . 
  society that has some level of homogenity works better than society with two fractions fighting against each other . 
  i 'm worried about the long-term outlook , if we 'll have a very liberal approach to immigration , what will this place look like in 50 years ? 
  perhaps it will be fine but why risk it if there 's a safe option on the table ? 
  i 'm one of them , i think it 's completely reasonable to be worried about this wace of immigration ( the opposite is what 's crazy actually ) . 
  nah , western european countries do n't have the balls to even mention that . 
  and if the choice is between islamization and eu money , i think people here would n't hesitate for one second . 
  yeah , you could say that . 
  but you can also argue that countries like germany have an unfair advantage over less developed countries because their companies were there first and could develop and capture market share when it was easier to do so . 
  it 's not easy / profitable to enter mature markets such as cars or cpus . 
  i did n't imply otherwise , my point was that they are not what i consider our products . 
  if i buy a skoda , some of that money ultimately ends up in germany 's budget . 
  `` our '', 
   from the gdp projections i 've seen , the gap between our countries is only going to grow nah , i think we 're just in the up cycle , i 'm almost certain the real long-term growth is higher for poland . 
  no prob , i 've come across it on hacker news . 
  nice to hear that . 
  it would be a human scyscraper . 
  mexico 's drug exports to the usa are in billions . 
  if replacing russia is allowed , then replace it with the usa ( not canada because the economical benefits would be lower ) . 
  if not , replace some really poor and unstable country with a similarly-sized rich country . 
  moldava with quatar or ukraine with new zealand . 
  ( sorry , i 'm just pragmatic . ), 
   in greece it is difficult ( more than other countries ) for older people to get work . 
  they are almost unemployable and discriminated . 
  what is discrimination of old people , i honestly do n't know , can you give an example ? 
  do you experience racism in czech rep out of curiosity ? 
   we were taking about good will , not the exact amount of money that came to greece one way or another from europe or the u.s. 
  i was talking about the latter . 
   europeans have not been showing the greeks any good will for years . 
  it 's hard to judge , i honestly do n't know what were the exact motivations , but i really doubt that there was no good will . 
  well , you can always buy the same amount of food for 1 euro , it does n't matter if i gave it to you out of good will or not . 
  but yeah , if we only consider money given to greece out of good will , it 's probably not 1000x more but i 'd say that europe donated vastly more than the us . 
  the case this article is talking about is absolutely negligable . 
  if i lend you 100 and i want only 50 back , i have given you 50 . 
  europeans have given about 1000x more money to greece than the americans .

  home grown to get rid of dirt and stor bought to get rid of whatever they sprayed it to keep it looking fresh . 
  the only thing i do n't clean are bananas for obvious reasons . 
  oh yes , that 's true !, 
  i did n't think of that . 
  and i do n't think we have any of those here . 
  i use local version , but set it to display english results . 
  never been to one or even heard of one . 
  i also never heard of american cuisine , maybe apart from burgers . 
  is n't almost everything taken from other cultures ? 
  anyway , searching for * american restaurant * , there seems to be some . 
  mostly offer burgers and steaks and seems distinctly american-themed , but i 'm not sure what to look for since i 'm not familiar with dishes of american cuisine . 
  you seem to be implying it would help . 
  however , i do n't remember a single recent ( honestly , i do n't remember any ever , but i suppose there ought to be some ) shooting in the us that was `` resolved '' by a civilian use of a firearm . 
  european system is fine . 
  most eu countries allow people to own firearms , just under conditions you are physically and mentally able and are able to pass a test . 
  that 's fine and i see no reason why this should change . 
  if i do n't count being given a sip of beer at a young age ( < 10 ) , i never started and do n't see any reason to start now ( 22 ) . 
  which is pretty much heresy in czech rep.

  in my family we grill mostly fish , sausages ( mostly [ shorter thicker local variation ] ( https://cs.wikipedia.org/wiki/\u0160pek\u00e1\u010dek ) i do n't know the translation for ) , skewers and vegetables . 
  and less frequently burgers and other meat . 
   why does n't anyone use air conditioning ? 
  it gets seriously hot ( 30-40 \u00b0 c ) only during the summer . 
  and even then it 's usually enough just to point a fan at oneself . 
  it 's simply not worth it financially to install air-conditioning everywhere . 
   but no one ever mows the lawn or trims the bushes . 
  i suppose it depends on the park , but generally they do get mowed regularly . 
  how `` tall '' was the grass you saw ? 
  it may just be that we do n't mind a little taller grass instead of trimming it to 3cm height all the time ( i actually do n't know what is usual grass cutting height ) . 
  hard to tell , but the motivation definitely would n't be as strong . 
  english opens tons of doors , whilst learning basically any other language with exception of maybe chinese does n't . 
  since the beginning of high school we are supposed to study 2 foreign languages . 
  i had russian as my second language . 
  it 's been couple years since i finished hs and i can say `` i do n't understand russian . '', 
  and read ( but without understanding ) cyrillic . 
  i will be picking up spanish now ( because uni requires us to have 2 foreign languages ; one at least at b2 ) , but again , i plan to pass it on the lowest possible level and never touch it again . 
  i believe my time would be better used for improving my english . 
  i do n't think i have aptitude for languages . 
  my english is only this good , because i have been using it basically daily since i was ~ 15 y/o . 
  hence i doubt i would be particularly stoked for learning another language i wo n't use . 
  because if i wo n't use it , i wo n't learn it and most definitely will forget it before long . 
  given the financial shitstorm that is being rained on britain , i think there is a good chance noone will follow any time soon . 
  first you get a note from you doctor stating you are fit to drive and whether you need glasses . 
  then you pay driving school and you will have to drive with teacher for ~ 50 hours ( i do n't remember ) . 
  they will also give you some instruction as to the technical side of things . 
  there were classes , but i honestly do n't remember whether those were mandatory . 
  they were however completely useless . 
  after finishing this course , you do the theoretical test ( law , theoretical driving and few medical questions ) . 
  after you pass that you do the driving test and the maintenance test ( for lack of better words ) . 
  driving is obviously driving around ( and parking ) for a while in traffic and then 2 quick maintenance questions ( what are these lights for , what 's abs , ... ) . 
  then you get your license for a car . 
  no , problem  i was just curious . 
  i suppose . 
  calling it * usurping * just feels kinda negative . 
  it 's still taught obviously . 
  it 's often offered as second foreign language . 
  it 's by far not as popular as german , which is considered the most useful due to us sharing so much of our border with germany . 
  i 've heard recently that russian is becoming more popular lately ( still miles from german though ) . 
  when i was at grammar school few years back , there were less than 30 of us ( out of 120 ; 4 classes ) studying it . 
  less than 15 had french and the rest had german . 
   how badly is english usurping its role in eastern europe ? 
  what 's wrong with english ? 
  i fail to see how . 
  that would mean every war for independence is a revolutionary war . 
  revolution is france fighting it 's leaders and becoming ... bit different france . 
  war for independence is 13 colonies rising against their masters and gaining independence from them and forming a new country - usa . 
  i do n't disagree . 
  i mean , i have n't read trough it ( and i wo n't ) , but torture is n't the only problem about the cases / u/invisible182 mentioned . 
   you are ignorant of our laws , please do not comment on them as for that , well , some posters took it as offence for whatever reason , but it 's not like op is being very understanding either . 
  * american war of independence * is taught from the point of view that americans were oppressed . 
  we do n't really go into much detail . 
  pretty much just the boston tea party , who won and what was established afterwards . 
  probably not even one 45 minute lesson in high school is spend on it . 
  it 's also generally not called * revolutionary * as it was n't as much of a revolution as it was gaining independence . 
  surely those people got fair and public trial as required by the 5th , 6th and 7th amendment ? 
  there are good doctor and bad doctors . 
  plain and simple . 
  and i imagine it 's like that everywhere . 
  as for wait times , well , that depends on the hospital , but generally you will have to wait unless you are in immediate need of help . 
  we pay small fee for a visit/check-up ( like $ 5 ? 
  ; i 'm not sure if they changed it ) and small fee for a receipt . 
  i 'm not 100 % about medications , but you should get at least partial coverage on those you need . 
  all necessary procedures are paid for you , but usually anything extra ( like better , more expensive procedure ) is paid for by the patient ( the insurance will cover the price for the basic procedure , you have to pay the rest ) , but generally it 's not overly expensive . 
  for example lasik is supposed to cost $ 2000/eye on average in the us . 
  here , i found the most accurate and safest priced at around $ 900 ( inc. 20 % vat ) . 
  that would n't be paid for from my insurance because i do n't need it . 
  i got glasses ( which the insurance partially pays for ) , so anything extra is on me ( though i think i would still get a small part paid for ) . 
  as far as i know , we follow the [ european firearms directive ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/overview_of_gun_laws_by_nation#european_union ) . 
  the rules are pretty clear so there is n't much the police can do if the gun fits the criteria . 
  written part of the test is like a school test . 
  i 've never heard of anyone dumb enough to cheat on it , so i do n't actually know what the outcome would be . 
  it 's 20 questions of of pool of 600 questions on variety of gun-related topics . 
  practical exam is to an extend self-regulatory . 
  the police itself does n't conduct the testing . 
  they usually do n't intervene at all . 
  volunteer shooters ( who had to pass a special test ) conduct the testing ( they are paid for it however ) . 
  the police is just making sure it 's all done right . 
  as for varying difficulty , it 's there , particularly with the disassembly part of the exam , where some examiners was very fine details and some just want you to know the basics ( around 10 terms ) . 
  i personally failed this part once , because i got * difficult * examiner .

i was n't talking about specific people . 
  those muslims who would do those things in europe do n't dare to do that in the us . 
  never suggested such a thing . 
  i dont know how any sane person could think that sentence implied that . 
  you comparing wwii events with the current situation in ukraine is disingenuous . 
  i hear rosengard is a beautiful place to live . 
  you 're a bit prejudiced against fox , not * all * their news are bad . 
  i was n't citing fox though . 
  you can ignore it all and just listen to what that iman has to say . 
  if being an intellectually dishonest dummy is doing something right then go ahead and celebrate . 
  if muslims keep breaking the law more than any other group and are overrepresented in prisons . 
  not to mention the other things and you ignore it then you 're the one who 's an idiot . 
   notably sweden , in 2005 , making the laws much broader . 
  this will lead to an increase in rape reports based on the law . 
  however , it also inflates the cases from 2004 - 2013 in the report by the fact the swedish police investigate each independent case . 
  so the women are making that up just to hurt our beloved muslims reputation . 
  haha a true multiculturalist you are . 
  [ sweden ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rape_statistics#mediaviewer/file:rape_rate_per_100,000_-_country_comparison_-_united_nations_2012.png ) is the rape capital in europe . 
  swedish ( and some other european countries ) media try to hide the fact that it 's done by muslims very hard . 
  when muslims rape or kill somebody in sweden it 's always the `` youth '' . 
  do you people not know how to use google ? 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rape_statistics#mediaviewer/file:rape_rate_per_100,000_-_country_comparison_-_united_nations_2012.png now go and look whos behind these rapes . 
  haha . 
  i love this attitude of yours . 
  czechs are not a minority in prague unlike muslims in those nordic capitals . 
  so you can fear some of islam , but not all of it ? 
  i think quaran and hadith clearly show us that we should fear it . 
  majority of rapes in stockholm , oslo and copenhagen are commited by muslims . 
  they did n't fear islam . 
  all right . 
  but it 's not irrational to fear islam . 
  that was a famous british iman . 
  look , i 'm losing my patience with you . 
  you 're just repeating the standard bullshit . 
  you 're saying that the fear is irrational . 
  do you know that sweden is the rape capital of europe now ? 
  i deleted that comment because it served no purpose anymore . 
  did you not get that from my comments that i fully believe islam is a threat , a not just any threat . 
  the biggest threat . 
  one reason would be immigration laws that accept better people than europe does . 
  for an exmaple average iq in amsterdam is the lowest in europe because of the muslim immigrants . 
  also the fact that they ( at the moment ) do n't dare to do things muslims do in europe . 
  imagine muslim rape gangs in america . 
  or them burning the american flag there . 
  that would n't end well . 
  tatar muslims know they do n't want to fuck with russia . 
   show me hard concrete proof of this . 
  [ here ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gw4shccx_y4 ) . 
  or you know , use google . 
   oh look , clickbait from a tabloid journalism . 
  not to mention the same site that 'll spin as much bullshit as they want , and people take it as fact . 
  give me an actual concrete proof that is n't sensationalist bullshit . 
  cherrypicking as always . 
  there 's no proof i can give you that would convince you . 
   oh no , anti-semitism that 's also being compounded by bigots over israel is happening as well !, 
  and the fact the honour killings and rapes show there 's a lack of screening . 
  and first-gen who are either refusing to integrate or are completely denying any other culture than their own . 
  yes , those need to be dealt with , but being a bigoted shit wo n't resolve anything . 
  as i said , islam is a danger . 
   and the sharia police/zones ? 
  those have been smacked down repeatedly . 
  unless they somehow become permanent , which i highly doubt they will , they 're minor problems by zealots . 
  unless they get physically violent , the police will do what they do and break them up time and time again . 
  we are not arguing about police here . 
  and well , if you doubt they wo n't be a permanent problem then it 's all okay . 
  minor problems ? 
  no they 're not . 
  and the more muslims there will be in europe the more of these `` minor '' problems we 'll be facing . 
   wow look at all these african countries that have outlawed lgbt rights that are n't directly muslim !, 
  totally a small minority doing it !, 
  not directly muslim ? 
  so indirectly they are ? 
  yes , subsaharan africa is in many cases even more backwards than the muslim world . 
   no , i 'm in fact not a muslim . 
  i 'm here to smack down bigots and racists as they crop up in this subreddit . 
  and you 're a bigot who 's refused to see islam in another light beyond the vocal minority of extremists . 
  and there 's easily ways to fight it , but nope , nobody wants to touch it . 
  haha , you 're actually helping without knowing it . 
  keep calling people who fear islam bigots and racists . 
  i know muslims who are `` liberal '' what i 'm saying is that the word islamphobia is ludicrous because the fear is very rational . 
  get this inside your head , please . 
  even if the minority consists of 15 % of the muslims islam is still a real danger . 
  also considering the fact that many of them are radicalizing in europe . 
  that 's a strawman . 
  i told you not to compare what russias doing in ukraine with genocide . 
  you were comparing genocide and protecting interests of russians and continue to do so . 
  ukraine is/was part of russian sphere of influece . 
  how is that buzzword ? 
  that 's a fact . 
   catholics spread the word of their god by the sword , and colonized virtually the entire world . 
  they upended trade routes , forced natives together who 'd kill each other , and caused mistrust and hatred of people of certain descent in europe . 
  geez , this argument . 
  yes , everyone commited attrocities in the past . 
  however , we do n't live in the past . 
   you 're telling me islam is ` backwards and bloodthirsty ' , when it 's pretty fucking clear it 's not . 
  all because of different cultural norms , which many change as they 've integrated into european culture . 
  but no !, 
  their religion somehow makes them violent barbarians that must be expelled from europa !, 
  you must be blind . 
  the rapes , honor killings , sharia police , sharia zones , anti-semitism .

nope , you make a complaint to some institution that should solve this problem . 
  when i look up to western media i mostly only see photos of children and families . 
  when i look in our media all i see is men in 20 's screaming and attacking police/borders . 
  demanding they have rights as a eu citizen . 
  ofcourse i sometimes see that too in west but it 's minority just like real refugees among those economic migrants . 
  but . . 
  but that was greece , not us !, 
  to add on some information . 
  you should be 18 to be allowed to drink by law . 
  everybody drinks from 15 if not even less . 
  i personally drink about 4l of beer per week and i am not 18 yet . 
  this is not exceptional , like 80 % of people of my age drink about the same . 
  we also drink a lot of vodka and rum ( with coke ) edit : typos, 
  please read it again, 
  i was in malta this summer . 
  i saw nothing and was drunk 2 weeks in a row :d alcohol was not that expensive, 
  to add on : people complain that they need to organise charity for some sick ( czech ) children so they could be treated in hospitals . 
  it 's been in tv constantly pointed out . 
  now suddendely 15 syrian children are offered free help from the government . 
  ordinary people are really pissed right now edit : typo, 
  remember the president election ? 
  when this came up , people got upset and did not want to talk about it at all . 
  by publicly i meant in tv political disscusions, 
  yup , drugs are pretty big deal in czech r. big part of the population is racist . 
  and we still ca n't speek publicly about [ expulsion of the germans . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bene%c5%a1_decrees ), 
  `` where are you from ? '', 
  `` czech rebulic '' `` oh , czechoslovakia '' - like wtf , that shit does n't exist for 25 years, 
  president milo\u0161 zeman - when he is not `` drunk '' he has good speeches . 
  not commenting about the content . 
  when you are asked have a beer or any other kind of drink . 
  just go and drink it, 
  i 'll have just as good chance to find the source as much as you . 
  it was repeteadly mention here and in several link shared here . 
  if you prove me wrong i be happy to aknowledge it . 
  there is a big difference . 
  syria is in civil war . 
  that meand different region of same country fight with each other . 
  this was an invasion by one of the biggest military alliances in the world . 
  no , i am saying that we are not breaking any treaties by refusing to take those refugees in . 
  and there is no outer power that has a right to force us doing it . 
  i would be personally happy if we would take 5k-10k voluntary . 
  but if somebody ( merkel ) tells us what to do or ... well that 's blackmail and duck them, 
  i never called him stupid . 
  if you want to criticise my answer , do it properly . 
  look it up , https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/warsaw_pact_invasion_of_czechoslovakia, 
  eh , and who sets those values ? 
  those values can mean different thing to different people . 
  forcing your pov of the world on other people is just bad . 
  european values for me , mean our rich cultural history and point to help other people , but not to help them in suicidal ways . 
  but that 's matter of willingness of each country . 
  these agreements are only set for the first safe country the refugee goes to . 
  walking halfway thru the world to get to your dream country does n't count . 
  it 's hard to fight when you wake up and you find out your country has been invaded few hours ago . 
  when there is n't even a side to fight with against the occupants . 
  when your government says it 's `` good '' invasion . 
  czech radio station has been hiding and running away from russians for 3 days calling for help . 
  how are you supposed to fight when you do n't have that possibility . 
  comparing civil war to an government aprooved invasion is stupid . 
  you layed the argument on same level as did the `` president '' . 
  father told me : when we went to austria and we saw three gasoline stations in a row . 
  we were like `` why would anybody need so many gas stations in one town ? '', 
  mother : we went to see our friend in ulm ( germany ) whom have illegaly emmigrated . 
  she had two tv 's . 
  her own car . 
  and all that food in the grocery shops . 
  - some talks about elections - she said that a lot of her local friends did n't vote . 
  my mother went a bit crazy . 
  `` you can actually choose a political party and you throw your vote just like that away ? 
  you have all that freedom and democracy and you just say ` nah ' about it ? '', 
  her friend now moved back to prague . 
  the qoute is not precise , but the meaning stayed the same . 
  the church is going to pay some expenses . 
  it would be political suicide atm . 
  to invite muslims . 
  us and europe are not the same ... eu comission has no rights to send `` armed '' personel to countries without theirs approval, 
  irish drink more than czechs ?!, 
  we demand a trial by beer !, 
  the drivers did n't dodge ? 
  when there is a traffic jam everybody here makes a line in the middle for the ambulance . 
  in the czech news , it 's often discussed that czech republic has one of the best health care systems in the world . 
  it 's free dor `` students '' ( under 26 ) . 
  then your employer has to pay it for you . 
  ( one of the reasons why income is so low in czechia , about 30-40 % of what employer pays goes to the country , insurance and other stuff . 
  ambulance is by your place almost everywhere in 15minutes , prague in 5mins at max . 
  the main problem is that doctors are really under-paid . 
  you can see a lot of czech doctors working in germany and living on czech side of borders . 
  from what i know , it was n't abou if it is sekt or champagne . 
  more like that juice ca n't be named juice if it gets under some % . 
  i understand your pov . 
  everybody calls sekt a champagne here . 
  it 's not about name of brand but about name of the drink . 
  commies doing what they always did , steal and blame the victims, 
  i call myself a federalist , i want to see united europe , but in abou 50-80years ... 
  i do n't see it possible in the next 50years . 
  _ the current version of eu is a joke . 
  posts in eu are pseudo posts with no power , but high income ( eu mp has abou 3x more money then czech mp ) . 
  all they discuss is what kind of cheese is supposed to be named like . 
  that 's bullying , atleast it 's viewed like that here . 
  _ when we opposed quotas , instead of discussion , we got threats , if we wo n't listen to moma merkel dotations should be cut and shit like this .

  i was trying to make pun , sorry, 
  even two is too much, 
  you wish, 
  not only nice whole country, 
  yeah for example ukraine, 
  i do n't get it bro . 
  i am sorry, 
  i am always saying `` bene\u0161 degrees '' were not fair based on experience of my family, 
  i think just saying thank you is not enough for what your nation did . 
  ask india, 
  it is just a joke , i was in romania and i really liked your countryside . 
  i will say it again , this is awesome even more for me as i got only a good experiences with dutch people . 
  you just assumed he has got brain in the first place, 
  sandwich, 
  here we go again !, 
  looool, 
  i had no idea we the czechs and slovaks are not the only nations to enjoy this adorable show , i find it cool . 
  no you did not , nothing makes you obliged to answer , it was your choice, 
  amen !, 
  ehm i mean omina !, 
  okay !, 
  the question is if you accept his early books or later crazy ideas, 
  people how are flipping arguments about iq are mostly a bit odd, 
  calm down he is just copy pasting , do not take it seriously, 
  he was not this kind of black, 
  more like phew phew phew, 
  and isis, 
  you just got banned from r/pingpong,

  isis when following same logic destroyed historical relicts in rakka , nice work !, 
  edit : i was wrong , sorry, 
  obviously not behind a thin trees, 
  give me few euros per month and i will pray for him as if he were my sick cat, 
  it always gets me pissed when reading some article from uk about `` czechs '' who did something unethical when these `` czechs '' does not even speak czech, 
  pretty much always when was my house robbed it was gypsies : / already been robbed of our car , few bikes , lawnmover , phone , metal ... and i could continue ( i don \u00b4 t wan na ),

  as a czech i am pleased to read someone find us cool enough to share same country with . 
  ahoj to new citizen , from ostrava,

  lmao, 
  there are dozens of us !, 
  dozens !, 
  thank you for your interesting insight, 
  you should not tell her :d, 
  why so ?

  i study modern spanish history and i can tell you that it caused a lot of national embarrasment and helped create an atmosphere within the society that later strenghtened franco 's position with his `` make imperio espa\u00f1ol great again '' . 
  the decline of spain , symbolized by the defeat of 1898 , remained a very prevalent topic throughout the 20th century and was often mentioned in works of top spanish thinkers like ortega . 
  even now when i discussed spanish politics with a student from andalusia , he mentioned 1898 as the first reason why many spaniards have low national self-esteem . 
  it would a political suicide . 
  some time ago there was an effort to introduce premium care in hospitals , but that caused quite an uproar , as people ( quite rightfully i 'd say ) complained that best medical approach should not be something depending on your wealth . 
  i 'd say i 've seen quite a lot from our country , but then again , that 's not much of an achievement given its size . 
  it is just the one that is most widely known ( yet that does n't prevent some cunts from trying to log there ) , but there are other old-growth forest in europe . 
  for example according to our [ wiki ] ( https://cs.wikipedia.org/wiki/prales#pralesy_v_.c4.8cesku ) , there are several small ones in czechia , some of which are n't even accessible to public . 
  one third of our country is covered by forests , out of which rougly only 0,03 % are old-growth ones . 
  yeah , they exist and poeple go there , but i 'd say they lack the finesse of let 's say austrian , italian or french caf\u00e9s . 
  our coffee culture seems limited to `` i need something to keep me awake '' , that 's why `` turek '' is still so prominent here . 
  in caf\u00e9s , coffees are often not served properly with stuff like water and we mostly care more about quantity than quality ( but that 's my personal view of course ) . 
  and speaking about the social aspect , pubs and restaurants are the primary places to go here by a large margin . 
  the term was used in the past to ridicule those who stood by v\u00e1clav havel 's ideals , which are considered naive by many pragmatic politicians . 
  when our current president milo\u0161 zeman took the office , a lot of people who voted for `` havlist '' candidate karel schwarzenberg did n't exactly accept their loss and continued to scorn zeman whenever he allowed them the opportunity , which he did quite often . 
  basically the same situation that occured in the us after trump was elected . 
  in response , he and his spokesman ( a really nasty and zealous man , something like mouth of sauron ) started to reuse this term to make zeman appear closer to his actual voters , who are usually from outside prague and other larger cities , as well as simply spit in the face of his critics . 
  this , however , led to an even more widescale division in the society , where part of the society is called `` kav\u00e1rna , pravodl\u00e1ska\u0159i , slun\u00ed\u010dk\u00e1\u0159i '' ( caf\u00e9 , truthlovers , sunnies ) , and zeman 's supporters are being under constant fire from our `` elites '' . 
  some arguments against the `` caf\u00e9 '' are valid i 'd say , as they often seem like arrogant moralizers who are too distant from everyday problems of ordinary citizens , but then again , zeman does exactly nothing to ease the tension , he viewes it as an opportunity to strenghten his position . 
  the term `` prague caf\u00e9 '' is very metaphorical though , as even in prague there are few people who actually go to caf\u00e9s to discuss politics or art . 
  not that there are n't caf\u00e9s , they exist , but pubs and `` hospody '' ( something between a pub and a restaurant ) are the place where people socialize in the first place , in prague and the rest of the country alike . 
  edit : typo, 
  about 18 euro 100/10 mb/s optical , only very rarely drops below advertised value . 
  there is basically none . 
  it swiftly died out during communism . 
  our dear mr. president now uses the term `` prague caf\u00e9 society '' as a pejorative term though , so you could say we have an caf\u00e9 anti-culture . 
  my high school , history basically ended with the dissolution of the soviet union , but many teachers here in czechia fail to get even past interwar period -- i was actually quite lucky that we got so far . 
  at my university , where i happen to study history , current events and stuff that happend after 11/9 are normally included to a large extent , but nineties are a bit neglected . 
  they will say mean things to you on the internet :(, 
  teenagers here drink something that is called cider quite often , but it has nothing to do with actual cider/cidre/sidra that is popular in britain/northern france/northern spain , it 's just a super sweet beverage for those who want to drink something soft but do n't fancy beer or wine for some reason . 
  it 's not exactly unpopular , world championships are often on the national sport tv , there is actually a dedicated rugby field 500m from my house , but it is not a mainstream sport and we can not compete even on the european level . 
  more popular than handegg though . 
  in long term , we tend to be among the best in ice hockey and floorball , we do well in various branches of cycling ( mtb , fourcross , road , cyclocross ) , we usually have at least one player in top 10 in tennis ( both atp and wta ) , and we continually do very well in canoeing and rowing . 
  regarding athletics , we have a strong tradition in javelin and decathlon . 
  thanks to a strong generation , we can compete with the dutch in women 's ice skating , but currently we do also very well in women 's biathlon and snowboarding . 
  oh , and we used to kick ass in fucking [ cycle ball ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cycle_ball ) . 
  [ king porridge ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rudolf_i_of_bohemia ) long story short , he ate a lot of porridge . 
  [ this is one would be quite representative i 'd say ... ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_b0cyoao8y0 ), 
  without czech you can survive in prague and probably also brno , but do n't expect a lot of enthusiasm from the locals . 
  czech is quite difficult to learn though . 
  probably simply gulaschsuppe in austria . 
  no matter how we do it , they always do it better , 
  yeah , the connection , albeit weak , probably exists , but that particular trend was a result of something rather emotional in a particular time period . 
  to illustrate the actual disconnection , i live right next to one of the largest remnants of an celtic oppidum here in czechia ( edge of prague ) and there are very few people who actually know or care about it now . 
  only very recently they have added at least some info boards to the site and mayyybe there will be some excavations in the future . 
  yes , i believe there were even some historians who promoted the theory , there are for sure some czechs who bear some celtic dna , but the thing is that other than the name bohemia , there is not much left from this culture at all , not even many archeological sites . 
  after the boii there were also the germanic markomani and those seem to have actually moved on further to the west years before the czechs and moravians arrived , so the temporal gap between the boii and our slavic ancestors is enormous . 
  current czech culture is a mix central european slavic , german and a bit of jewish legacy i 'd say , we even have almost zero celtic loanwords unlike some other european languages . 
  the thing in the nineties was about building village-like open-air museums , some role-play events etc. , but it died off quite quickly and now we are again more focusing on ancient slavic elements . 
  now that you mention it , it is quite funny that icelandic is germanic language that probably takes most from a celtic language , as a lot of irish were taken as * thralls * by the vikings to serve on iceland . 
  how does the celtic element manifest itself now in wales ? 
  from the isles i 've been only to scotland , where i have n't felt the it too much ( everything was more focused on modern scottish , not some old pictish traditions ) . 
  in brittany i 've felt it more through the various historical sites , but the society still seemed very french to me ( the continuous hardline french centralization is probably the reason , the prosecution that the bretons faced after the french revolution was quite severe ) . 
  i 've been to galicia , which tries to promote itself also as a heir to the celtic culture , but that is quite a joke , it 's present only in some modern symbolism . 
  here in czechia we also used to have a fad in the nineties that we are actually heirs to the boii tribe , it was probably a desperate effort of some people to distinguish us from the slavs and germans who tried to dominate us in the 20th century , but that was a rather ridiculous dead end of course . 
  of course , but i was trying to point out that various forms of english throughout history adopted a lot from other language families , especially romance ( french , latin ) and celtic . 
  more than the mainland germanic languages for sure . 
  scotland is germanic only in terms of dominant language ( even though scottish gaelic still lives on ) . 
  wales is a similar case , but there was a lot of immigration from england in the times of industrial revolution , as more workforce was needed to run the coal mines and related industries . 
  the proximity of wales to england probably also makes the population more related to that of england , but the country still keeps some of its celtic identity . 
  northern ireland is known for a lot of english immigration dating back to the medieval times , so you could say it is closer to being actually germanic than for example scotland . 
  ireland proper would be the same case as scotland -- linguistically dominantly germanic but celtic in terms of identity and ethnicity . 
  it is also worth noting that the whole of the british isles experienced a lot of germanic immigration during the middle ages -- angles , saxons , jutes , normans and vikings ( and later a certain ruling dynasty ) , but the cetlic populations in britain and ireland were not replaced , they just added to the mix that forms the societies that we see today . 
  no nation in the isles is now ethnically purely germanic or celtic and so is n't english a purely germanic language . 
  before the fall of communism there was zero to none legislature to protect the environment except for some basic stuff for national parks , so the quality of air was of course terrible even for a country focused on heavy industry . 
  as a result , in some regions and cities , the demonstrations that led to the velvet revolution started as movements for better environmental protection . 
  it was genuinely important , but it was also safer to protest for cleaner air than to directly criticise the political nature of the regime . 
  another interesting thing about environmentalism in czechia is that our greens used to be right-wing oriented until their debacle in the 2010 parliamentary elections when they failed to obtain the necessary 5 % of votes after being part of a government , which led to a change in leadership and a gradual switch to left-wing programme . 
  yes , especially the teenagers were mentioned during the legislation , but the situation used to be quite ridiculous for anyone who did n't really want to drink just beer . 
  since it is very safe to order alcohol anywhere in czechia even if you are underage , there used to be zero reasons for anyone to choose 0,33 l of bottled water over 0,5 l draft beer for the same price . 
  the prices of non-alcoholic beverages like juices and sodas are still very high in general when compared to those of beer , but at least you can now order some mineral water for a reasonable price . 
  another problem was that people here also did n't use to know that you can just ask for free tap water if you desire so , which is something that was also promoted during the campaign . 
  things now got better , waiters are now less surprised and rude if they are asked for it and you can get some widely popular beverages like [ kofola ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kofola ) for a price comparable to that of beer , while the prices of czech beer have not increased drastically i 'd say . 
  polish people often say that we sound like toddlers to them while to us they sound like disabled drunkards trying to speak , 
  all restaurants and pubs are obliged to offer at least one beverage ( at least some water ) cheaper than beer . 
  yes , this law is more than necessary here . 
  the idea of a single czechoslovak * nationality * was artificial and was abandoned in the thirties when it was no longer needed as czechoslovakia was already established as a state with a dominant slavic element . 
  any territorial state is artificial to a certain degree , and so was czechoslovakia . 
  but then again , there are no perfect single-nation states in europe , it 's politics what mostly dictates the borders , so there is nothing special about it . 
  what people often do n't realise is that czechs and slovaks shared a state or at least a ruler for a great part of their history , beginning with great moravia . 
  there were many cultural phenomenons that were imported from bohemia to upper hungary throughout history , culminating in the 19th century . 
  the events of the 20th only deepened the similarities and suppressed a lot of hungarian legacy by importing the cisleithanian/german style of administration to slovakia and the joint experience of communist rule within the same state also creates a bond between the nations , so the idea of reunification is not entirely out of place and would be justifiable also based on those arguments . 
  but then again , few people wish that or even care for that , so there is no point in speculations , 
  it was a political decision . 
  after the constitutional reform in 1968 which established a federation , the separationist sentiments in slovakia were lower that ever . 
  if there was a referendum in the nineties , the split would probably not have happened . 
  but it is hard to tell if the federation would last until today . 
  it is believed that the split , which eliminated most tensions between the nations , made it possible that we view each other in even better light than before . 
  if the federation survived the transition , other issues might have appeared during the harsh transformation or during the economic crisis , and that could easily swing the general opinion towards separation . 
  economy was at the root of most of our disagreements during both periods of czechoslovakia 's existence , not just pure nationalist sentiments . 
  edit : reunification is something that is currently not discussed even theoretically , both countries seem to enjoy playing on their own playground . 
  slovakia seems to do very well on its own and there is no `` imperialist '' sentiment in czechia . 
  regions like slovakia , carpathian ruthenia , or even whole of silesia are not part of our national identity or myth , so the general populace does n't miss them like serbia misses kosovo or montenegro , which are deeply tied to its national history . 
  i 've made the second trip quite recently , from prague to romania ( including buchurest ) via car . 
  i can recommend that one of course , but just skip bucharest unless you really want to visit a post-communist reality in its prime . 
  it 's not really that seeing it would n't be an interesting experince despite the little aesthetic value and few interesting things to do , it 's still quite exciting to see the terrifying architecture of the cheaucescu era , but the problem is that there is not much to see in a large area around the city and buchurest is just not worth the trip alone in my eyes . 
  i suggest that you focus on transylvania and then often neglected moldavia ( not moldova ) and the danube delta . 
  those regions are stuffed with unesco sites of both types . 
  the architecture , the nature and the people with their regional attitudes are worth seeing , all of the three regions have different cultural backgrounds and it 's like visiting three different countries . 
  i also greatly enjoyed visiting montenegro and albania , but i feel that it 's best to visit this region during springtime .

  i will never vote for a polititian who is not convinced a policy he or she is selling is right .

  excesive bureaucracy always hurt . 
  that is a job for the counter-inteligence , which can monitor suspicious organisation without any special legislation . 
  i do n't think it always wise to intervene either . 
  many of those organisation are corupt and do n't actualy achieve anything . 
  if qatari want to waste money aimlessly in russia let them . 
  i say it 's much more important what is the organisation doing rather then from where does the money come from . 
  why would `` foreign agents '' have to make funding clear in the first place ? 
  what does that achieve beside hurting science and possibly other fields ? 
  to what end exactly ? 
  people like krugman are still incisting there must be some other option than just austerity , but they ca n't find it . 
  free trade is when anyone can buy and sell whatever they want to whichever price they want .

  you are a bad advocate . 
  politics . 
  they probably wanted the talks to fails in a way which would make it look like it is n't their fault . 
  correlation is not equal to causation . 
  poor economic decisions undermine fundamental rights by leading a country into the state from where austerity might be the only way out . 
  this is a very risky stance . 
  costs are irrelevant when there are no other options . 
  so far greek goverment seems to do everything to limit eu options .

  of course you can arbitrarily inflate gdp by wasting money .

  i ca n't judge ideological background of syriza by their actions . 
  actually i ca n't judge them by their actions at all when they are n't currently able to take iniciative because of the lingering crisis .

  their reasoning is fine . 
   what ca n't be logically explained is worth exactly nothing as evidence . 
  you mean evidence like reports of eye witnesses or signiture verification ?

  how ? 
  triglav is 2,863.65 metres ( 9,395.2 ft ) , they are pretty high,

  that 's high for them at the moment .

  our social democrats are not as liberal and modern as one would think . 
  they are actually the opposite , bunch of old politicians with history of corruption scandals and great relations with top 1 % of oligarchs . 
  ano has the advantage of the image of fresh party with minimum of scandals and corrution cases . 
  they are ruled by 2nd richest man in the country though , that 's the odd . 
  many czechs always ask themselves before elections : who to vote ? 
  because , there is hardly truly relatable , modern and uncorrupted party . 
  i do n't know , personally i 'm not in favor of referendum regarding lgbtq . 
  referendum should be implemented when it concerns everybody , and not in a way that majority is going vote about the rights of minority . 
  that can turn in a way `` why shoudl i care when it does n't concern me '' or voting against due to malicious reasons even though it is crucial for the affected minority . 
  maybe modified to local conditions , it can work in france . 
  here , we oppose strong institutions ( the heritage of dictatorship ) so it 's not really duable here . 
  also , our politicians do n't behave like the ones in scandinavia , they would exploit the system for themselves . 
  maybe they have other qualities , that small boys would appreciate, 
  our social democrats wanted the same , but it would be hard to implement it here .

  they would necessarily land in italy or france or spain and then be distributed throughout europe . 
  therefore the infux of african migrants would not be affected by czechia 's acceptance quotas since they arent the county that is the primary first stop for these migrants . 
  its not heartlessness , but a simple real world application of the trolley problem . 
  if you accept large swathes of migrants today , you are necessarily destroying your options to help the countries that they are fleeing for . 
  this of course exacerbates the problem rather than solving it . 
  accepting the migrants is not a long term solution and you even concede it is n't one . 
  but then how is this problem solved ? 
  accepting these people wont solve the root of this problem . 
  yet you do n't link to credible information, 
  they most certainly did not view the soviets as allies . 
  right from its inception the soviet union was at war with poland in the polish-soviet war . 
  not to mention that few countries had formal diplomatic relations or even recognized the soviet union as a legitimate state until the mid 1930s . 
  their relationship was not good at all , especially considering the soviets saw poland as lebensraum to spread communist ideals and recover previous russian land lost .

  the last time he did was in the first republic ( and it was still in an unofficial capacity ) . 
  his only political power is vetoing bills that can then be passed through the parliament anyway without his approval . 
  his primary raison d'etre is to serve as the country 's face to the world and go to diplomatic parties and parades , just like your queen . 
  in fact until 2 years ago , the president was not elected either , making the comparison to your queen even more valid . 
  you have no idea what you 're talking about . 
  that would make it confusing for other people who see ch and automatically think its pronounced like the ch in `` ich '' . 
  plus , the only time you ever see cz in a word in english you should know it 's of polish origin and therefore is pronounced like `` ch '' , the same way you know that the `` ti '' in caution is pronounced like `` sh '' . 
  we actually do pronounce japan that way . 
  our word for japan is derived from the chinese pronunciation of the word nippon . 
  our pronunciation of the word china is due to the onetime influence of the westernmost kingdom in the chinese region , the qin ( pronounced chin ) . 
  zongguo just means middle nation and does n't reflect the ethnicity of those living there . 
  so yes , the names we call people from different countries is derived from what they called themselves . 
  by your logic czechia is not a problem either since `` we 're talking about a name , an arbitrary arrangement of phonemes assigned to an idea '' which means any word created would be valid to use , which means you can not say czechia is not a good name . 
  furthermore however , country names are not subject to these rules . 
  as a nation state , the name of the country derives from the people who live there . 
  that is why france was inhabited by franks , england by the english , kazahkstan by the kazahks . 
  so the czech republic is inhabited by czechs . 
  transform that name into a shortened noun and you have czechia , just like croatia , slovakia , slovenia , russia , romania , bulgaria , etc. 
   czechia , though , is genuinely difficult to say . 
  sure , if you have a terrible stutter or cerebral palsy . 
  as far as words go it is very simple to pronounce : che ( as in the argentine revolutionary ) + kia ( as in the south korean car company ) . 
  was that so hard ? 
   engish would have adopted it by now the reason why it has n't been adopted is because people still use czechoslovakia when referring to the country , how ever often that is . 
  its not exactly as relevant as a superpower like the usa . 
   czeska is good , czechy is alright , even czesko would be acceptable those are all your extremely subjective opinions and have no bearing on czechia as an acceptable term or not . 
  moreover , the people and/or official representation of the country itself have expressed their wish for the international community to use czechia . 
  how would you react to everyone calling you country kannuckistan even if your country uses canada in its official correspondence ? 
  after all , many countries end in - stan just like many countries end in o. 
   people do n't use czechoslovakia to refer to the czech republic . 
  that 's not a thing . 
  there are old people that forget that the czechoslovakia does n't exist , but that 's a different mistake . 
  lol . 
  people most certainly do use that term , including people in their early and mid 20s . 
  i should know , i interact with them on a day to day basis . 
  not everyone is good at geography and even fewer people take the time to correct themselves once they hear misinformation . 
   pps the french ` tchequie ' is pronounced like czechy . 
  i 'm guessing you either do n't know how tchequie is pronounced or how czechy is pronounced . 
  tchequie ends in a hard `` kee '' sound as in the word key . 
  czechy ends in a soft ch sound like in the german word `` ich '' proceeded by the short `` i '' sound as in the word `` it '' . 
  and yet people continue to use slovakia and slovenia . 
  besides , its the caucus 's fault that they have similar sounding names to other places . 
  just look at caucasian iberia and albania . 
  czeska and czechy do not adequately convey the idea they represent . 
  ceska is grammatically incorrect , in both languages and czechy refers only to the westernmost crownland of the country . 
  czechia conforms to pre-established conventions in naming countries and has exactly the same origins as bohemia , just with a slavic base word instead of germanic . 
  not to mention most other languages already commonly use the czechia variant such as french = tchequie , spanish = chequia , german = tschechien , italian = cechia , turkish = \u00c7ekya , even indonesian = cekia so basically everyone likes czechia , english is just being an outdated dick about it by continually colloquially using czechoslovakia . 
  no , czechia is a valid term . 
  it was pushed by the czech government in the early 90s as an alternative to the longer czech republic , but unfortunately it did n't catch on and people continued to refer to the country incorrectly as czechoslovakia . 
  calling it bohemia is exactly the same vein of logic as calling it czechia . 
  bohemia derives from the german word for the inhabitants of the country while czechia derives from a polish ( slavic ) transliteration ( since not all languages contain czech letters ) . 
  not to mention most people today associate the name bohemia only with the westernmost crownland and not the smaller lands of moravia and czech silesia , which confounding when discussing the country . 
  therefore it is preferable to use the term czechia when referring to the modern nation state that encompasses the czech speaking part of the defunct czechoslovak republic as it it both concise and easily interpreted . 
  1812 never forget !, 
  hon hon hon !, 
  * i agree wholeheartedly !, 
  but then again , he did kill the guy who killed hitler . 
  yeah , beer normally costs 15 . - to 35 , - kc which is 0.5 to 1.5 eur, 
   regardless of if they practice safe sex the high risk category of msm are exactly the ones who do not use protection . 
  gay monogamous relationships and ones that always use protection have the same incidence levels of the general population . 
   ban a few thousand , tens of thousands of people and you get rid of literally most of the hiv risk . 
  and yet hiv blood transfers still happen , showing the shortcomings of this current policy . 
  women who had sex with at risk msm pose one of the largest risks now , but there is n't much of a push to substantially crack down on this population . 
  a blanket ban like this just shows society 's continuous ignorance when it comes to these diseases . 
  msm are by far the highest risk group and many of them too have sex with women ( likely also without protection ) . 
  these women are somewhat included in some blood bans but not at all regularly because of the likelyhood of them knowing their partners previous sexual history . 
  this however does n't reduce the fact that the one of the highest risk group of people for causing hiv blood transfers are these women . 
  his point was that hiv transmission is elevated due to the nature of receptive anal sex . 
  both sexes can have anal sex and those are the ones at a higher risk of acquiring hiv from their penetrative partner . 
  the other way is around is much less likely . 
  this does n't shed light on the entire issue . 
  men who have sex with men ( msm ) do n't all identify as gay . 
  in fact many refuse the label for fear of social rejection . 
  this state of mind also reflects on their larger risky behaviour ( i.e. 
  `` only gays can get xyz , but i 'm not * actually * gay , i just fuck men . '' ) . 
  furthermore the virus is detectable from antibodies in a span of 2 weeks thanks to advances in medical technology . 
  i have no idea where you 're getting your 6 months number , since the previous industry standard was about 3 months . 
  lastly , on the point of economics , do you realize the incidence rates of other blood diseases ? 
  in the us , poor , black people are more likely to be affected by disease , should be issue a blanket ban on all black donations ? 
  after all they , too make up a relatively small minority of the population . 
  not to mention the discrepancies in the fact that by far world hiv infection rates are largely propagated by heterosexual couplings . 
  since immigration to the us is impossible if you are diagnosed with hiv , should we issue blanket bans on immigration to people from africa , where this disease spreads most virulently ? 
  and yet blanket bans for donations do not affect them even though they are more at risk than other groups of people . 
  do you realize that this blood ban intentionally generalizes one substantial minority , regardless of the safe , healthy individuals it makes up and who are willing to help other with their potentially rare blood specimens ? 
  or do you not care because you 're not part of that minority ?

  some of them stayed , but they were in a minority . 
  of course , this is just two cases . 
  that 's not a perfectly representative example , however we see that that the refugees are not only refusing to go to ee , where they , as you say it , could starve or freeze to death , which i also disagree with , maybe that 's the case in hungary , but the social network here is definitely not weak enough to let anyone starve or freeze to death . 
  of course asylum seekers here do not get enough to lead comfortable lifes ( i.e. 
  what the middle class has here ) , but they are also not starving to death . 
  also , they 're getting exactly the same amount of money as czech people when they ask for state support . 
  the same exact conditions apply for both czechs and people who were granted asylum . 
  they can ask for state social support if their income is lower that a certain % of the average income , just like czech citizens do . 
  yep , people granted asylum usually can not ask for unemployment support , but that 's because they have n't worked here before . 
  again , this also applies to czech citizens , if a high school graduate finishes school and ca n't find a job , he is also not getting unemployment benefits , since he was n't employed before . 
  this is just how it works here , you first have to contribute to be able to ask for benefits . 
  if you do n't , you 're only entitled to the bare minimum . 
  surely you would not advocate that refugees should have better conditions than local citizens ? 
  but even if i accepted that refugees in ee are literaly at risk of starving to death , how do you explain that they also do n't want to stay in italy , portugal , spain , or even france ? 
  clearly , the motivation of these people is to seek out the best conditions for themselves , not just acceptable conditions . 
  which is quite understandable , on the other hand , letting them get away with this behaviour is unsustainable . 
  not for ee , but for we . 
  we actually do n't really have to worry about this , we can just say `` look , they do n't want to stay here , there is nothing we can do to make them stay , so you deal with this '' . 
  and we largely do this . 
  and rightly so , because we have no obligation , not legal nor moral one , to help people who do n't want our help . 
  we only have legal obligation to help people who agree to ask for asylum here . 
  if they do n't agree with that , or they do at first , but withdraw their application later , we are not legally obliged to help . 
  however , for we this is totally unsustainable , which is why i absolutely do n't agree that we should even out our financial support for refugees . 
  they should actually even out ours and provide only the absolute bare minimum . 
  this is the only way the reduce the pull factor . 
  there are millions and millions of people in the middle east and africa who have the ambition to come to europe or will have the ambition in the future . 
  we can not help them all , that is simply impossible . 
  of course the reduction of pull factors needs to be accompanied by the reduction of push factors as well - that means massive investments to the development and general improvement of the conditions in mena . 
  in the long term , this is imo the only sustainable policy , since if we do n't do this , than we 're risking that anti-eu parties will get in power in more and more countries in the eu and we will end up not helping anyone anyway and we might even cause the destruction of the eu as we know it . 
   you still need to stop and help if you see an accident happen even if you 're late from a date . 
  that does n't even make sense , it 's not ever remotely close to the actual situation . 
  if you wanted to use a better analogy , you would have to write something like `` you have to stop and help if you see an accident happen , even if the person in need tells you that he/she does n't want any help from you , but only wants help from your neighbour '' . 
  i 'm curious how do you think we should help people who do n't want our help ? 
  how is portugal supposed to help when people are refusing to go there , even after the portuguese pm goes to the refugee camps in greece to make it clear that they 're welcome in portugal ? 
  how are we , the baltics or poland supposed to help refugees when even those few that we took decided to leave our countries ? 
  what would you want us to do ? 
  do n't worry , it was the same here . 
  we transported a few dozens of them directly from mideast refugee camps and most of them left to germany after a month or so . 
  this also happened in poland and the baltics . 
  not all the refugees are this opportunistic , but a significant part is . 
  on one hand , i kinda get it , they want to get the best deal for themselves , on the other hand , they can hardly expect any solidarity from our people , when they make it pretty clear that anything else than rich western european states is not good enough for them . 
  sorry for responding so late , but for some reason reddit only showed me this comment now . 
  weird , right ? 
  anyway , what you 're describing was largely my point . 
  i 'm just a bit allergic when people say it 's just polish who receive negative attention in the uk . 
  it 's not just the polish , it 's pretty much everyone who comes from the eastern part of the continent , since as you say , brits do n't really make any difference between us . 
  i understand that not all british people are like this and that openly hostile behaviour is pretty rare . 
  however i know quite a lot of slovaks who spend some time in the uk working , and their experience is that almost no one will tell them anything nasty in person , but it was not unusual to learn that some of those seemingly polite brits will say things like `` those eastern europeans do n't belong here , they should really go home '' behind their backs . 
  of course this is just anecdotal evidence , but it makes you wonder how many brits actually do mind about eastern europeans , only they do n't say so openly . 
  it would be kinda strange for me if i was living in the uk not knowing whether all those locals who are polite to me actually secretly want me gone . 
  but you 're right that this kind of reaction to large numbers of immigrants is pretty much natural . 
  i guess people from cee will just have to either live with this , or leave the uk . 
   it 's why we differentiate between expats ( who tend to be retirees and clump together into their own groups ) and migrants ( who actually seek to assimilate and essentially become a native ) . 
  it seems to me that an expat is just a fancy word for a migrant . 
  if you want to stay somewhere pernamently , then you should make an effort to fit in that society and not insisting that you do n't actually have to do that , because you 're just an expat . 
  i do n't see any difference between poles staying pernamently in the uk and brits staying pernamently in spain . 
  so what that they 're retirees , nobody forced them to go to retire in spain , they chose it themselves , so they should at least try to blend in the spanish society . 
  just likes poles should absolutely learn english if they want to stay in the uk . 
   they really dislike that people can move permanently to the country without knowing english . 
  i can understand that , but it 's a little bit strange coming from brits , since british expats are pretty well known for not bothering learning the local language and instead using english , even if they live in the foreign country for years . 
  i can even understand them when they do that in prague , since czech is a very hard language for non-slavic speakers , but what about those brits living in spain ? 
  spanish is not even that hard to learn . 
  and yet you have brits living there in their own exclaves , barely knowing any spanish . 
  i understand that polish people are by far the biggest group of all ee migrants , so we 're statistically way more likely to hear about attacks against them than other ee migrants . 
  however the average brit does n't really make that much difference between all the ee nationalities so i do n't see how is the situation for the average slovak/lithuanian/bulgarian etc. 
  different . 
  they may not be poles , but brits will either confuse them for poles , or they will just consider them the same `` category '' of migrants as poles . 
  so they might have to go through the same shitty situations just like the polish people do . 
  all i was saying is that it is imo not polish-limited . 
  yeah , that 's exactly what i was thinking . 
  that 's why i found it weird when the op was saying that it 's just the polish who get the negative attention , when in fact brits do n't really make any difference between poles and the other ee nations . 
  why do you think it 's just poles and not eastern europeans in general ? 
  are n't hungarians/slovaks/czechs / lithuanians/latvians/estonians treated more or less the same ? 
  and what about bulgarians/romanians ? 
  honestly , the first thing that came to my mind was that they just emigrate way more than us , but the stats are about relative numbers , not absolute numbers , so that ca n't be it . 
  so my second guess is that out of all the slovaks who emigrate there is a significant part of them which are low educated and low skilled so that means they 're more likely to end up on the criminal part . 
  whereas people who emigrate from czechia are mostly highly educated , so they 're just not the demographic group that typically ends up in jail . 
  but that 's just my theory , i do n't really have any statistics backing it , just anecdotal evidence . 
  our authorities do n't collect this kind of data anyway , people are not obliged to let them know when they move to other eu countries , so there is really no way for us to know who exactly leaves . 
  so this is really just a guess . 
  emigration in general is not a mass thing in czechia , those who leave usually have a good reason to ( interesting job offer , a partner from abroad ) and again , those kind of people are not that likely to end up in jail compared to the demographic group that went to the we to do the low-skilled jobs that locals did not want to do . 
   czechia will experience progress , and you will very likely close the gap over time . 
  well , i wo n't argue with you further , but i remain sceptical about closing the gap . 
  it would be cool though if you were right . 
  i realize that i probably sounded very pessimistic in my posts , but that was not really my intention . 
  i was just trying to realistically evaluate our chances of catching up with we on macro-economic level . 
  that all does n't mean that i believe that my country has no future or that it is a terrible place to live or anything . 
  i realize that we have it better than most of the world . 
  low unemployment , relatively low cost of living , relatively affordable housing , free education and healthcare system , so yeah , it 's not like i wanted to say that i 'm living in a hellhole or anything . 
  also , do n't worry too much about what 's fair or not . 
  there is in general very little fairness in the international politics and trade . 
  countries just mostly follow their interests and do what 's good for them , not what 's perceived as fair . 
  the fact that you 're having it good does n't mean that you 're somehow obliged to help all those who have it worse than you . 
  it 's not like we expect any charity from the we . 
   czechia has actually performed somewhat poorly among peers lately afaik we jumped on the austerity train during the crisis way too enthusiastically , stopped all the funding to infrastructure projects and effectively killed the economic growth . 
  on the plus side , we maintained relatively low public debt . 
  we recovered in 2015 and nowadays we have a relatively steady growth rate . 
  but anyway , it 's not like i was claiming that there will be no progress . 
  of course there is a possibility to progress . 
  what i was trying to say is that while we progress , we countries will progress as well .

  actually , i think it 's a bit higher , but some people did n't want to admit it . 
  have you really never broken any social contract or law in your life ? 
  i do n't consider it despicable at all , it 's simply in our biological programming and everyone has weak moments in the span of their entire life . 
  edit : downvotes for an opinion ahoy !, 
  would n't have the danish nation died out if virtually the entire population was infected ? 
  can you point me to any sources ? 
  and consensus will never be reached . 
  so unless someone fucking steps up and proposes an actual solution , they will be accumulating in italy , greece , spain and escaping to france , germany and the uk . 
  i 'm honestly surprised no politician of these 6 countries has stepped up . 
  i guess it 's a political suicide though . 
  fucking finally . 
  greece , the country . 
  you know , athens , acropolis and stuff . 
  ok , apologies , you/he were right . 
  but still , they were not forced to pay the debts like greece is , they chose to pay them some 35 years after the fact when you were economically well off . 
  greece has been given no such choice . 
  and reparations for ww2 which would be immensely massive in comparison to ww1 reparations were n't levied altogether but forgiven right away instead . 
  it united for the first time in [ 1871 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/unification_of_germany ) . 
  1990 was a * re * - unification . 
  we are czechs , not germans . 
  if you mean the 1988 film , it was actually american , only the eponymous book is czech . 
  tired of being exluded i see !, 
  the thing is , the inflation would n't happen in this country in trouble ( say finland ) , but in germany !, 
  so by inflation , german workers would get higher wages , german products would cost more , and by comparison , finnish products would be cheaper . 
  ** the choise is between inflation in germany or internal devaluation in finland . 
  ** and since internal devaluation is incredibly scarring for half a decade at least , germany should be forced to have internal inflation for the good of the entire eurozone . 
  but because germans are the strongest political power right now , everyone is afraid to go against them . 
  both with inflation and internal devaluation , the wages in real tems remain roughly the same -- they will be able to buy the sama amout of bread for example -- the only change is in nominal values . 
   so apart from workers being annoyed being annoyed by their wage decrease are there any other benefits for inflation over internal devaluation ? 
  that 's a loaded question . 
  if you ignore the * incredibly damaging * effects of `` workers being annoyed being annoyed by their wage decrease '' , then no . 
  but you really underestimate what this means . 
  because workers will be annoyed when you lower their wage , they will resent their boss and work less , or even sabotage work . 
  so the boss wo n't lower their wages , he will instead fire 1/4 of his workers . 
  and he wo n't hire any more workers for some years before the salary expectation of the workers lowers enough . 
  and if you fire 1/4 of the workers in a given country , incredibly bad things will start to happen . 
  and it will snowball from there . 
  it 's a recipe for disaster . 
  i 'm happy to answer your questions , do n't worry . 
  afaik internal inflation and external currency exchange rate do n't have to be connected when the central bank does direct operations on the currency market . 
  the central bank just floods the currency market with lots of kronas , and as supply and demand dictates , excess supply depreciates the exchange rate . 
  and because they 're * selling * , not buying , they can do that for unlimited amount of time , and will actually be accumulating wealth to the central bank . 
  china has been depressing their exchange rate in the same way for the past two decades , and that 's why they have one of the largest holdings of gold and government debt of any nation . 
  america on the other hand can not realistically do this , because unlike the krona , the us dollar is just too large , so you 'd need to dump * stupendous * amounts of money on the currency markets to do the slightest change . 
  i ca n't imagine how it felt for a finn to have their national company desecrated in such a way . 
  i myself thought elop should be charged for his actions . 
  10 % and * rising * unemployment , and one of the worst economic performances in europe . 
  ask finns , they 'll tell you as they told me , they 're fucked . 
  they can start direct operations on the currency markets . 
  depreciating the exchange rate is n't a problem , only appreciating is a problem . 
  and negative interest rate is a short term issue , you were taking large amounts of immigrants for longer than half a century . 
  i 'm sorry but you do n't know much about economics . 
  it 's sad when people do n't trust the only people that actually know what 's happening to their economies . 
  and that 's why in a decade or so , you will likely be the next greece . 
  italy was no where perfect before , and nobody is saying that . 
  the euro by itself is n't your only problem , and nobody is saying that either . 
  your imperfections * and * the euro is what 's going to kill you in . 
  but unless you start trusting economists , you will not be able to avoid that and will end up even worse than greece . 
  well , as a member of the most drunk nation on earth , i do n't think you understand what `` quite a bit '' means . 
   i 'm sorry but no the entire island of cyprus should be part of the republic of cyprus . 
  why ? 
  at least one and probably two countries on the island disagree . 
  if you want somebody 's legally owned land and they do n't want to give it to you , you 're free to declare war on them , but that 's all you can do about it . 
  sure , they are bases , i never argued they were n't . 
  it does n't mean it 's not their territory . 
  and the people living there might be soldiers and their families -- what does it matter ? 
   these are the restrictions on the land since the british d not have `` legal right to their territory '' . 
  they might have signed some restrictions , that 's their prerogative . 
  so far you have n't made any argument or showed any proof that it is n't their legal territory . 
  i 'd be glad if you show me proof of that . 
  edit : also , those two bases *** are *** in fact [ british overseas territories ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/akrotiri_and_dhekelia ) , please check your facts . 
  edit2 : and it was your own republic of cyprus that voted down unification with the north , so even your own countrymen disagree !, 
  edit3 : to cut this short , cyprus has agreed to these two bases being uk sovereign territory in exchange for uk granting the republic of cyprus independence from the uk . 
  you agreed to it , now it 's the law , and you ca n't change it unless you actually declare war . 
  you might want the territories , but you have no legal right to them . 
  absolutely . 
  and because all those things , the exchange rate was falling fast throughout the last 30 or more years . 
  which meant that even with all your problems , you still remained mostly competitive and the country was n't completely getting fucked , just somewhat through your own faults . 
  but now , thanks to the euro , your exchange rate can not fall , and internal devaluation is extremely damaging , so your country will turn into what greece is now in about a decade or a little longer , unless you make drastic changes . 
  thanks to germany 's incredibly low inflation , euro makes good economies into bad economies , and bad economies into absolute disasters . 
  i really do n't want to see it , but unless something very radical happens , i believe italy or spain will be the next greece , the next complete implosion of an economy , and only after that big changes will be made . 
  nobody cares about greece , but when italy or spain fall , changes will * have * to be made . 
  in either direction . 
  if majority of northern cypriots want to live in a united cyprus , why have n't you united yet ? 
  i think you misunderstand what `` country '' means . 
  island and country are completely different things . 
  there are many islands that are occupied by more than one countries . 
  cyprian people are people from the country of cyprus or northern cyprus . 
  the majority of people living in the uk territory on the island of cyprus are british living on british territory that happens to lie on the island of cyprus . 
  they have as much legal right to their territory as you do to yours . 
  as life itself , it 's usually both . 
  the majority of northern cyprians want cyprians out as well . 
  should the country of cyprus leave ? 
  why would uk abandon their sovereign and lawful territory just because people in some different country close by do n't like them ? 
  i 'm afraid that 's a racionalization your politicians have been spinning you without much basis in truth . 
  since sweden is n't in the eurozone , your currency exchange rate takes care of all of that . 
  you do n't have to manage internal inflation or devaluation to remain competitive , all you need to change is the exchange rate , which is very easy and in the competence of your central bank . 
  this is not a north-south , west-east divide , however !, 
  ** this is center vs. north , south , east and west divide !, 
  ** and it actually makes a lot of sense , because economists have been saying for a long time the ** euro will hurt peripheric countries ** .

  sweden 's example showed that you can avoid it pretty much indefinitely . 
  yeah , people here largely also do n't even know that such an idea exist . 
  no one ever informed them that this was the general path that western european countries decided to take . 
  then of course it 's hardly surprising that anti-eu sentiments grow here when the eu tries to push for common asylum or migration policy . 
  because people never even knew that the eu has such an authority and they certainly did not knowingly agree with it . 
  eu was almost exclusivelly sold here as a free trade area that would bring economic prosperity , plus it would make traveling , studying and working in other countries easier . 
  do n't know if it 's the case in other ee countries as well , but at least here no politicians and also no representatives of the eu institutions in cz have ever tried to properly introduce the other aspects of the eu integration . 
  the idea of the ever closer union was never really a part of the discussion among the general public . 
  if anything , it was discussed among the academic/intelectual/political elites , not among the `` ordinary '' people . 
  i did n't know there was only one universally accepted definition of nationalism . 
  this is not how nationalism is mostly understood here . 
  if anything our nationalism is really just protective nationalism - people are protective of their way of life and sensitive about any foreign elements which could disrupt it . 
  yeah , that 's true , it would be very amusing to see him at the summits trying to act diplomatic though . 
  still , it 's kind of weird , because ano is officialy pro-eu , they are even in alde . 
  but babi\u0161 definitely has even harder stance on the migrant crisis than our current pm . 
  it 's funny , because out of v4 countries , czech public is probably the most eurosceptic , yet we have a relatively pro-eu government and the governmental parties are leading all the polls . 
  whereas polish and hungarian people are more in favour of the eu , yet their governments are relatively more eurosceptic than ours . 
   the bulgarian fm was mentioning the funds will be cut from countries with low rates of utilization aah , now that makes much more sense . 
  i thought they simply cut them to all new member states as the guy in the video was mentioning . 
   and it wo n't affect ( too much ) countries with lower absorption either ( since they would n't have had utilized the funds anyway ) . 
  that 's probably why nobody protested then . 
  but still , the fact that someone had a low absorption rate in the previous years does n't mean they would also have the low absorption rates this time . 
  i do n't know about hungary or poland , but we also sucked a lot at absorption for a long time and only managed to almost fully absorb the 2007-13 programming period with some last-minute effort . 
  so i do n't think it 's right to cut the funds to countries like romania , bulgaria or crotia , who actually need the money the most , just because they 're expected to not absorp them fully . 
  it was n't presented at all , at least i did n't notice a single news report about it and i read czech media daily . 
  you 're right , it 's kind of weird . 
  even when our fms themselves agreed with it , i would also expect the press to report on this , specially since it 's eastern european countries only who got their funds cut . 
  you 'd think this would be the perfect material for media . 
  interesting . 
  when i was reading the news about eastern europe having their funds slashed , i automatically just assumed that the eu has cut the funds of the entire cohesion policy and that it is only interpreted as eastern europe having the funds cut by the journalists because we are the main net recipients of the cohesion funds . 
  i did n't know that the eu has cut the money * specifically * only to us and kept them the same for all other countries . 
  i think it was supposed to mean something like `` we can work together in the eu , because we trust each other a lot '' not `` we will literaly go and steal money from the eu '' - orb\u00e1n would not be so stupid to openly admit that he sees the eu as a giant cash flow . 
  ano is largely considered to be the populist party , it 's currently in the coalition with the social democrats and christian democrats and it is also leading the current polls . 
  it 's a party run by the second richest man in cz , who owns a large chemical/agriculture company and also two big newspapers + a radio station . 
  they 're basically a catch-all , anti-establishment party . 
  they purposefully do n't indentify as neither left nor right wing , so they can attract all sort of voters . 
  economically they could be probably described as center right though . 
  in everything else , they pretty much follow the public opinion , which is why they 're described as populist . 
   we categorically oppose any moves that would make nato redundant or obsolete . 
  maybe for now , but if trump is elected , he might dismantle nato by himself . 
  that 's why the eu should prepare for this possibility . 
  if trump is n't elected , we could have the eu army only as an additional force , one that we could use in the north africa/middle east to help stabilize the countries , so that not that many migrants come here . 
  for detering russia we would still have nato . 
  and you guys want to focus on asia anyway , so you should be glad if europe starts to slowly taking the responsibility for its own defense . 
  bit of both . 
  his political rivals ( including his coalition partners ) definitely want to limit his power . 
  at the same time this law was also supported by anti-corruption ngos and other representatives of the non-political sector . 
  and yes , it 's possible that he will go back to the shadows trying to influence politics from behind the scenes . 
  but i think it 's way more likely that he will try to `` sell '' the media to someone loyal to him and continue as a politician . 
  he might often say that he hates being in politics but i think he actually enjoys it . 
  he seems like the type of guy who is too impatient to stay in the shadows , he wants to have direct influence , not spend years lobbying with uncertain results . 
  plus he probably genuinely thinks he 's doing a good job for the country . 
  plus he is leading the polls , so i ca n't really see him quitting . 
  you 're welcome . 
  and btw . 
  a small update : the lower house of our parliament has just today approved a law that will ban government members from owning media and their companies from applying for state subsidies . 
  if the upper house and the president approves it as well , he will have to get rid of his media , or not run in the next election . 
  yep , most private czech media indeed do have ideological biases . 
  the economist pointed out some of them which are very anti-refugee . 
  we also do have very liberal , pro-eu and fairly pro-refugee media . 
  and then there 's the public tv channel , which tries to stay as neutral as possible and is doing more or less a good job . 
  long story short , media apocalypse is not happening here just yet . 
  granted , the economist is right that the attitudes of the public towards refugees are worse now than they were in september 2015 , but the coverage of tv prima is not the main reason why , the terror attacks and sexual attacks in the western europe are way more likely to be the main reason . 
  well this article was never really about peoples ' attitudes , it was about a disagreement between our governments . 
  the reason for this disagreement is for sure partly our preference to keep good relations with germany , but it 's really not the only reason , the current pm and foreign minister in czechia are simply from the moderate pro-eu part of the social democratic party and they have been trying to play the sort of moderate mediating role within the v4 basicallly ever since the government in poland changed . 
  and i mean , yes , our economy is quite dependent on germany , but how could the german government use that against us ? 
  are they going to force vw to close one of its most succesful and profitable brand ( \u0160koda ) ? 
  it 's really not that one sided , germany profits from their activities in cee region as well . 
  and all v4 countries combined import more german products than the us or france . 
  so it 's in everyone 's interest to keep the business relations working . 
  finally , while the attitudes of the public towards the refugees are the same here , if not harsher , like in poland and hungary , there certainly are some cultural differences between us . 
  the czech society is way less conservative ( when it comes to lgbt rights , abortions , drugs and so on ) and way less focused on protecting christian values ( since the majority of us are atheists ) . 
  i agree that majority of czechs share zeman 's negative view on refugees/migrants , but for god 's sake , please , stop quoting sanep as a relevent source . 
  it 's the same agency that asked people this question in one of their survey : `` the eu has forbidden the czech republic to use the terms `` pomaz\u00e1nkov\u00e9 m\u00e1slo '' and `` tuzemsk\u00fd rum '' . 
  do you think it 's right that eu determines how many refugees should each country take ? '', 
  and they did n't even properly pick the people they asked . 
  those people basically picked themselves - they voluntarily registered into their database and vote on the internet - so we ca n't even know if all of them are real people and not fictional identities . 
  not to mention that it is the worst kind of tabloid - blesk - who pays for surveys at sanep . 
  and obviously , they get exactly what they want for their money . 
  well , what can i say . 
  i do n't like him , i would never vote for him , i have a problem with that huge conflict of interests that he is in , but i can sort of see why other people do vote for him . 
  and i 'm not naive enough to think that politicians who do n't have direct ties to media or big companies are automatically clean . 
  yeah , we know . 
  it 's awful . 
  on the other hand , at least everyone knows that he is in a conflict of interests . 
  we know what media he owns , so we are aware that they are very likely biased at least in the domestic politics section . 
  we know what companies he owns , so he must be very careful not to leave any impression that he 's trying to promote their interests while in the office ( even though he probably does it to some extent , but has to be very subtle about it ) . 
  you will always have lobbying in the politics , or even corruption . 
  it often happens behind the scenes , so you do n't even know about it . 
  and it this case , it just does n't happen behind the scenes . 
  and so far , people do n't seem to be very concerned about it , his party is for now leading the polls . 
  granted , he 's basically a populist , definitely when it comes to the migrant crisis and also other issues . 
  but , he keeps the budget balanced , the unemplyoment is one of the lowest in the eu , salaries are rising and overall czech economy is doing pretty good . 
  and he 's the finance minister , so he 's naturelly getting a lot of credit for that , even if it 's not all his efforts ( we 're a very open economy , so external influences play a big role ) . 
  he 's basically running a pernament re-election campaign . 
  plus he 's drunk very often . 
  plus he gets money from russia . 
  so we can expect more original statements . 
  yeah , sorry i mixed up the terms , but it actually was signed in geneva , so that 's probably why i had that in my mind . 
  the article basically talks about a regular meeting of czech ambassadors with the czech pm .

  [ see ?

   at the end of the day what region people think a country belongs to does n't matter at all , so it 's not worth caring about . 
  you 'd be wise to stop caring about where people say your country is . 
  you 're right that there is no point in getting angry over this , but i do n't completely agree that it does n't matter at all . 
  in this particular case , ee carries lots of negative connotations . 
  it influences how people perceive the country . 
  and as i said in another post , perceptions do matter . 
  it has effect on how the country is attractive for tourists , foreign investments or highly-skilled immigrants . 
  reputation simply is important and that 's why it 's not really good to be considered ee . 
  oh no , please do n't start with this pan-slavic bullshit . 
  what connects slavs is the language proximity and that 's it . 
  i do n't attribute this to malice at all , i realize that most people mean no harm in calling us eastern europe . 
  uhm , okay ? 
  do i somehow have a duty to mention that ee is n't that bad or what ? 
  what i wanted to say is that i consider the west/east division obsolete , so that 's what i said . 
  i explained why i think that this division is longer accurate . 
  and i added that people do n't like being associated with ee because it carries negative connotations . 
  none of this means that i think all countries which are considered ee under the west/east division are shitty . 
  no , i said it carries negative connotations . 
  these connotations do n't necessarily have to be true in the real-life , but many people believe so . 
  oh , that 's all the way in the west of the country , right ? 
  i 've never been to that part of austria . 
  and i visit austria very often , usually at least twice a year , but we naturelly tend to go to places a bit more closer to the czech borders . 
  yeah , prague is actually full of everyone nowadays . 
  there 's jut way too many tourists from all over the world there all year long . 
  but i guess i do n't have to tell you about that , you must very well know this from vienna . 
  it 's not just that it 's simplistic , it also carries negative connotations . 
  that 's why people do n't like being associated with it . 
  i realize that it sounds petty and in a way it is . 
  i get that it even may be obnoxious when you have a czech person constantly reminding you ` we 're not eastern europe ' , but the thing is that perceptions unfortunately matter . 
  they can affect how a country is attractive for tourism , foreign investments or highly-skilled immigrants . 
  it can affect what a general standing a country has in the international scene . 
  well i 'm sorry to put it this way , but screw that . 
  i 'm not going to determine the position of my country in europe based on whether some people in a few northern or western european countries think that our economy is or is n't good enough . 
  nor am i going to do that in case of other countries . 
  obviously i can not tell other people how they should call us , but i 'm just going to keep identifying my country as central europe , not as eastern or western europe , no matter what the perception from abroad is . 
  i know you 're joking , but you guys and slovaks are the only countries that i could accept merging with . 
  i mean , it 's not something i would particularely want , but hypothetically if it had to happen , i could live with that . 
  not being called eastern european anymore would be just a nice bonus , 
  nobody is seriously calling you nazis . 
  when someone does that , it 's either a slur or a joke . 
  in our case , we 're being called eastern europe basically by default . 
  this term is meant seriously . 
  well how long is this cw division going to be used ? 
  until we catch up with the western europe economically ? 
  guess what , we already have caught up with the poorest ` western ' european countries - greece and portugal . 
  greece is now poorer than us and located more eastward , so what sense does it make to call greece western and us eastern ? 
  the cw division simply is n't working anymore . 
  it does n't work from the economic point of view , or the social point of view or the political point of view . 
  ` eastern ' european countries differ in everything - in their religion ( or lack of religion ) , in their social liberalism or conservatism , in their economic development , political attitudes towards eu/nato/russia ... there is n't anything which would bound all ee countries together so what sense does it make to throw them into one group ? 
  do n't get me wrong , i 'm not telling you that you ca n't use the term , by all means use it if you want . 
  in some circumstances , i get that it 's a convenient short-cut , for example when you want to talk about the newer eu member states . 
  at the same time , other people are perfectly entitled to point out that we do n't like this division , because we feel like it 's not accurately describing the reality . 
  yay , my home town . 
  it 's absolutely gorgeous , but do n't tell anyone , it 's perfect the way it is now with just a few tourists . 
  i would n't want it to turn into the next cesky krumlov . 
  that 's because we think that from the sociopolitical and cultural point of view we belong to the central europe . 
  most czechs simply do n't accept that 40 years of communism are more relevant than centuries of our previous development . 
  that 's a weird over-reaction . 
  it 's not like anyone is forcing us to get involved in this initiative . 
  given the numbers stated it the article , it seems that yes , this is what the majority of the relocated refugees prefer . 
  and i 'm honestly not that surprised . 
  welfare in ee is very low , they can make more money in we at the black market . 
  granted , cost of living is also higher in the west , but then they can largely rely on the support of their community , so they can save a lot of money this way . 
  for mena refugees it does n't have to be about where they have the best long term prospects . 
  they mostly need cash now . 
  they often borrowed money to get to europe . 
  they can have family back home which expects them to send money home now when they 're in europe . 
  also , this is of course a massive generalization , but cultural factors likely play a role as well . 
  mena cultures are n't exactly known for their patience . 
  they also tend to be very status-oriented . 
  these people made a large investment to get in europe and they expect the returns of the investment quickly . 
  and it also should be returns that they could present to their friends and relatives as a success . 
  this is why they tend to go after the short-term financial prospects over the long-term overall prospects . 
  sorry , i thought you were talking about deporting them back to their home countries , not back to estonia . 
  of course they can be send back to estonia , that 's true , however since we 're in schengen , they can very easily leave again . 
  and if they stay away from the attention of the authorities and are sheltered by their family/friends circle , they have a very solid chance at avoiding getting caught in the first place . 
   would be good to deport those who shop for benefits though you wo n't be able to do that , since those people come from unsafe countries . 
  thus they can not be deported there , even if you catch them living illegally in germany or other western european country . 
  ah , i see , thanks . 
   that 's not really accurate . 
  how is it not accurate ? 
  genuine question , not trying to start an argument or anything . 
  as far as i know , recognized refugees are allowed to travel within the eu , they just can not legally work and receive benefits in countries other than that which granted them the asylum status . 
  well without knowing anything about what your education and skills are , i can only tell what what the legal options are . 
  basically there are two option for non-eu foreigners to work legally in the czech republic . 
  the first is to get a regular work permit ( but for that you need a company to sponsor your visa ) , the second is to get a trade license and be self-employed - this gives you the possibility to be hired as a freelancer by numerous clients , so it 's quite popular among americans who want to teach english here . 
  you do not need to have a job offer in advance , so it 's easier to get than the regular work permit . 
  it has its cons as well though , for example you have to pay your social and health insurance fully as opposed to regular employees , who have them partly payed by the employer . 
  if you have any more specific questions , you can ask me . 
  or i would also refer you to / u/crimebeck18 , he 's an american living in prague and i have noticed that he does n't seem to mind to answer other people 's questions about how to move to the czech republic . 
  he would probably be able to tell you much more about the procedure than i can , so perhaps try sending him a pm . 
  yeah , well that depends . 
  in certain highly-skilled fields , you can reach a very solid cost-of-living/salary ratio , even as a foreigner with no czech language skills . 
  but in other fields , the lack of czech language skills would seriously limit you . 
  plus obviously non-eu foreigners face troubles when trying to get a work-permit . 
  it 's a combination of factors . 
  relative political and economic stability ( which makes us fairly attractive to foreign investment ) . 
  lower salaries and thus cheaper workforce compared to the western europe .

  interesting . 
  i did n't know the two ethnicities are so separated from each other . 
  maybe it 's also the effect of small country , where `` everyone knows each other '' . 
  here in cz ( we are also small country , but not too small ) , nobody cares from where your parents are . 
  if you have been born here or grown up here , you are czech . 
  it 's easy especially if you are `` white '' , because nobody would ever guess . 
  we have also many asians ( vietnamese mostly ) who where born here and they are very well integrated into society . 
  the only `` problematic '' group are gypsies who were originally nomadic travellers and they were forcibly settled during communism . 
  the newcomer muslims are novelty here and we do n't have any experience yet . 
  i know many people whos parent or parents are from ukraine , romania , russia and other european countries and you do n't see any difference between them and the majority . 
  also , my cousins are `` product of an intermarriage '' between czech and russian and they feel 100 % czech , more then me :-), 
  do you think , that russians do n't try very hard to integrate ? 
  or that the state is not efficient enough to include them in the major society ? 
  or is it a combination of both ? 
  thank you for your insight . 
  it can be true , that the division is between eu-russians themselves . 
  i 've talked to woman from eastern ukraine ( russian speaking ) and we have discussed the situation in ukraine . 
  she spoke very well czech and was satisfied with her life in prague , but her mother watched russian channels full of propaganda and twisted her opinions for pro-kremlin truth . 
  she said , she never thought , she would argue with her mother about politics and that they would alienate their relationship . 
  her mother wants to go to crimea now , because she thinks it 's a paradise and putin will take care of her . 
  it seems , that the division is even between families , friends etc. 
  i think eu should be more proactive when dealing with propaganda coming from russia , and it 's even more important for countries like estonia and latvia . 
  there should be more support for the local russian population to deal with this issue , they need to feel included and protected by the state . 
  we ca n't forget , that putin has a propaganda teams which target russians in the eu . 
  i would n't say americanised but globalised . 
  the whole europe is globalised as the rest of the world . 
  some countries less and some more . 
  it 's 21st century , the differences are getting smaller , times are changing and it does n't have to be just a bad thing . 
  how common are intermarriages between estonians and eesti-russians ? 
  if so , were they more common during soviet era or are more common since independence ? 
  are young people from both ethnic groups more similar to each other now ( culture , habits ) compare to the generation of their parents ? 
  this report is absolute nonsense, 
  it kind of makes sense , we are related the most to our nearest neighbours : slovakia , hungary , east germany and austria . 
  interestingly , poland and bavaria are more distant . 
  horrible !, 
  i would understand if the animal was terminally ill and it was in agony but to kill a young healthy lion is not normal . 
  do we have so many lions in the nature , that we kill them in the zoo ? 
  zoo , which is supposed to protect and conserve animal species . 
  do you kill humans , because they are so many out there ? 
  this zoo failed in it 's mission . 
  it seems to me like they want to just show off and they try to justify their intentions . 
  no , i just do n't like aggressive stone-age-mentality which seems to be prevalent in russia . 
  it 's not a problem of russia only , there are many countries and regions with high rate of human rights violation . 
  one word : russia, 
  the best guy in the eu parlament !, 
  germoney + bureucracy, 
  i see , i have stired up a hornet 's nest, 
  omg , you are so ignorant , that if your ignorance could talk , i would hear you here !, 
  you just want to hear what you like , that 's all . 
  well , you ca n't get furious about ignorant comments like i do , because you have zero emotions and zero empathy . 
  no , that 's maybe your research/s , but i do a proper research . 
  i am not biased , of course i have studied materials about injustice on sudeten germans and i have seen many interviews with people who were expelled . 
  what makes me furious , is that many comments here justify german behaviour in wwii and that czechs , poles etc. 
  just went crazy after the war and `` suddenly '' without `` any reason '' told germans : we do n't want to live with you any longer . 
  this comes most of the time from germans !, 
  i was shocked . 
  i thought , they study this period very precisely at school , but maybe i was wrong . 
  ... but i do my research . 
  hey , it 's actually a nice quote !, 
  you should post it here [ r/quotes ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/quotes/ ), 
  well , if i murder someone - let the wolves to tear me into pieces , i would n't complain . 
  fortunately , i am very well behaved person , so no problems with me :-) . 
  the only `` mistake '' i make is , that i always say the truth no matter what and it 's not always well received by everyone . 
  i guess , it 's really person by person . 
  if someone kills my family , i would n't forgive that person ever ( or anyone who support it ) and i would n't want to have this person as my neighbour . 
  you are probably more capable of forgiveness and suppressing your emotions , good for you . 
  history repeat itself , crazy, 
  omg , you just repeat the same thing all around . 
  crime does n't excuse crime , that 's right , but what i tried to explain to you 100 times is , that i understand why this happened at that time given all the circumstances . 
  nsdap has been officially banned by czechoslovak authorities in 1933 , so they have established [ sdp ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sudeten_german_party ) instead ( breed of nsdap actually ) . 
  henlein has been poisoned by german national movement since the beginning ( funny fact , his mother was half czech and he tried to hide it ) . 
  masaryk and bene\u0161 were not anti-german but they were against german nationalism in sudeten regions . 
  sudeten germans did n't want to hear anything about cooperation with czech majority , they just wanted to be puppets of germany . 
  they were becoming very confident with the rise of nationalism in germany and very hard to even discuss something . 
  [ some study material for you ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/generalplan_ost ), 
  omg !, 
  what did you learn at school ? 
  poor grandpa , he just fighted in wehrmacht , probably killed couple of poles , czechs , jews and returned home . 
  then the bastards czechs said : hey we do n't want you here and he had to go to reich about which so many sudeten germans dreamed . 
  very sad . 
  no , the very minority did n't vote for them , the vast majority did, 
  honey , study !, 
  ( p.s. 
  please do n't compare slavery and german expelling , two completely different events ), 
  poor germans , they just wanted to wipe out all the nations in the east and they have n't succeeded , so sad, 
  well you do n't understand what i mean . 
  you are looking at it from today 's perspective , and of course , we would not expel someone just based on his/her ethnicity today in europe . 
  if you want to understand why the expelling of germans happened in the whole europe , you have to look at it from the perspective of that particular period . 
  no , but in the atmosphere of wwii , it was the easiest solution for many . 
  [ the netherlands incuided ] ( http://expelledgermans.org/dutchgermans.htm ), 
  well , if the plan of your fellow germans have been successful , i would n't be here today . 
  i would n't be born , because my grandparents would have been killed as a kids by germans . 
  so i could n't be deported . 
  no in 1945 , but 68 % of sudeten germans ( eligible to vote ) in 1935 and 98 % in 1938 voted for nsdap, 
  most of the murders were committed by people who were collaborators with nazis and they wanted to hide their former actions by being aggressive toward germans . 
  those people have no character . 
  benes have never encouraged anyone to use violence . 
  his speeches were anti-german , that is true , but it was the result of the time after the war , it was expected from him . 
  we have to keep in mind , that germans were not popular in any european country which has been occupied by them . 
  he could have been more `` building-bridges '' person , but unfortunately he was taken by the emotions of the after-war europe .

  it 's our european values and laws that they 're judging . 
  and i believe they have the full right to do so ... as long as they stay abroad . 
  protest and riot all you want when you live in your own country . 
   fuck your double standard , smartass . 
  you know i 'm right , you know the threat is real , so the only way to reconcile your feelings is to turn your agression towards those who speak the truth . 
  then why on earth do n't we deport the `` worst of the worst '' back to their homelands ? 
  and why do we keep letting the `` worst of the worst '' come here ilegally on boats ? 
   different religions are n't a ) the only difference and b ) not necessarily a reason for conflicts . 
  why is it that russian , ukrainian and belorussian immigrants integrate well and do n't cause any troubles ? 
  why do americans , canadians and mexicans living in europe cause zero troubles with their belief systems ? 
  why is it that russian , ukrainian and belorussian children integrate well and do n't cause any troubles ? 
  why do second-generation americans , canadians and mexicans cause zero troubles with their belief systems ? 
  those people are destroying europe and we 're too feeble to stop it because we 're afraid of being `` racist '' . 
  migrants should have no right to judge the native people 's religion . 
  anyone having a single complaint about the beliefs of others should be put on the next plane to whatever country on earth fits their belief systems . 
  they should n't be allowed to stay once the war ends as their refugee status becomes expired . 
  however they should be able to apply for a permanent residence like every other person in the world . 
  those who meet germany 's requirements should be allowed to stay . 
  but of course this does n't happen and people stay far beyond the end of the balkan wars . 
  it blows my mind that an area smaller than the city of prague is an independent member of the eu , 
  because it 's easier to protect a single person rather than having the balls to deport anyone who does n't like atheism and christianity . 
  renzi is free to do whatever he pleases until the end of his term . 
  voters are free to remove him and his party from power when the next election comes . 
  that 's how democracy works . 
  turkey is : 1 ) a muslim-majority country . 
  it wo n't be affected by conflicting cultural values 2 ) is closer to syria , which means it 's easier to relocate the refugees back home when the war ends 3 ) does n't have a welfare system open for misuse and is n't attractive for economic migrants i 'd say we should pay turkey as much money as they want to house the refugees , as long as we can remove them from europe . 
  after the war ends each and every one will have to apply for a normal visa if they want to stay . 
  those who get rejected should be deported within 72 hours with no option to stay , regardless of the circumstances . 
  i have n't seen that happen in the case of yugoslav refugees and highly doubt it will happen with syrians . 
  apply for a normal employment visa like every single person in the world can . 
  if you receive it , you stay . 
  if you 're rejected , you go home . 
  that 's how it should work . 
  what percentage of syrian refugees are doctors and engineers ? 
  let them apply for an employment visa like everyone else and let them stay if they receive it . 
  meh , i do n't believe the rest of europe has the balls to do it either . 
  in 10 years when the war finally ends the government will find a million excuses to avoid sending the people back to their country . 
  that 's why i 'm against them coming here in the first place . 
  let us help them in turkey or anywhere else outside the eu . 
   if syria is safe again , they lose this status . 
  did every single yugoslavian refugee get deported when the war ended ? 
  i doubt it . 
  eastern and central europe should host nuclear weapons rather than military bases . 
  that 's the only real deterrence to russian agression . 
  instead of jailing people they should announce a 500 pound bounty for reporting a person who is successfully deported afterwards . 
  watch as the number of illegal workers drops to zero overnight . 
  the bigger question is whether every last syrian is deported when the civil war ends . 
   there isnt enough support for parents to have children and a job . 
  yet parents in countries with zero parental support give birth to plenty of babies . 
  most germans could afford having three kids , but they choose to spend their money on more interesting things instead . 
   you severly underestimate the desperation of some people , and seriously overestimate the capability of european nations to stop immigrants , even by force . 
  australia managed to do it . 
  we can do it as well . 
  it will stop if your chances of staying in europe after arriving illegaly drop from 50 + % to 1 % . 
  people are not stupid , they wo n't pay thousands of euros for a 1 % chance of success . 
  that 's right , czechs are not willing to accept a single refugee from outside of europe . 
  it 's their right as a nation to do whatever they can to protect their borders . 
   did you live there and experience it yourself thank god i do n't live there myself . 
   they wo n't have a devastating effect on local life increase in crime rate , decrease in literacy , spreading non-secular values , mosques in european capitals , lack of respect for women and gays , lack of respect for the law , living off welfare . 
  just a few things brought into europe by economic migrants . 
  i 've seen plenty of refugee ghetoes throughout germany . 
  czech republic does n't have much support for economic migrants so they tend to avoid our country . 
  no , because pressure graphs are n't created to support a politicized point . 
  those are the kind of people who have never seen the devastating effect of refugees on local life . 
  it 's not small but setting the base of the chart to zero makes it even bigger . 
  `` lies , damned lies , and statistics '' ( c ) the chart starts out at 55 rather than 0 in order to give the impression of a huge divide between eastern and western europe , confusing the reader . 
  people running from communism 30 years ago were well-educated , civil , christian or atheist , easily integrated themselves into society , and did n't cause any problems . 
  now compare this to the modern economic migrant . 
  i care a lot about the germans and do n't want them overrun with economic migrants either . 
  germany 's problems are czech republic 's problems as well . 
  iran is perfectly safe but people will invent any excuse to come to europe illegally . 
  then put them all on a plane to islamabad , where it 's safe . 
  it 's not our problem . 
  meh , i live in prague and can easily enjoy belgian , british , german , and any other european beer , both in bottles and from the tap . 
  i do n't care about tradition , i only care about the quality , the taste and the price . 
  you can make pretty much any kind of beer in any place in the world , so geographic location is irrelevant these days . 
  i 'm pretty sure you can get a good beer in every single european capital . 
  withdraw from the unhcr or demand that the treaty is renegotiated . 
  those laws can not cope with the influx of economic migrants . 
  the solution is to help assad and bring him back to power . 
  he 's the only person capable of restoring control over the country . 
  hope ikea moves out in that case . 
  i 'm going to miss their furniture . 
   i dont see why you have to make money on immigrants you do n't . 
   sure , they cost , but it save lives asylum applications should be processed outside the eu , given out to the needy first ( e.g. 
  orphaned children rather than healthy adults ) , and only within the limits we 're capable of supporting . 
  i 'll be laughing my ass off when sweden gets a new anti-immigrant government , deports every last one of them , and admits they were idiots living in a dream world when it comes to economic migrants . 
   there were n't billions of passengers a couple of decades ago and airline travel is decidedly cheaper today than back then . 
  it took a lot of time for the airline industry to scale to modern levels , while the pollution levels have been constantly decreasing . 
  it 's impossible to accomodate 12 billion new passengers overnight and by the time the industry goes to that level - we would most likely see planes which are a lot more efficient . 
   if everyone on the planet ended up doing the same , the world 's current ~ 3 billion passengers per year would be ~ 15 billion nope , if everyone would fly all of the sudden , ticket prices would go up accordingly and we wo n't see a significant increase in air travel . 
   just imagine the carbon footprint . 
  planes generate an extremely small percentage of carbon worldwide , not to mention that there is n't a conclusive model showing the effects of carbon on the atmosphere . 
  the idea of `` carbon footprints '' is a scam when it comes to travel . 
  then why it 's on the map ? 
  why is hebrew `` non-geographic '' rather than placed in israel ? 
  barcelona [ is at 26c ] ( http://www.seatemperature.org/europe/spain/barcelona.htm ) right now . 
  i would n't consider anything lower that 21c as pleasant . 
  too cold for recreational swimming , like all northern european beaches . 
  once the website deletes the content , it should be possible to petition google to delete it as well .

  people need some goals , some way to contribute to society and something the society can reward them for . 
  just saying that work is optional does n't magically solve that . 
  then there will always be income inequality , unless you live in an ideal communist state , which did n't fare well if history taught us anything and a whole consumer culture revolves around you having enough money to afford the latest thing . 
  well if germany ever gets erect , everyone around will freak out . 
  but the number of countries participating has been rising constantly , i think breakdown by country would be better . 
  romea.cz is hardly unbiased source , they are basically the polar opposite of stormfront and assorted trash, 
  that 's exactly how it works , but you have to account for legit use of painkillers and other drugs - if a city has a hospital with huge oncology clinic , the numbers for heroin would be inflated . 
  never ever trust politicians , always doubt what they are saying and fear the worst from them . 
  at least try to keep them honest . 
  however i ca n't imagine such treaty being passed without ratification by every eu country , unless something changes in the structure of eu . 
  it 's much easier to learn/practice english through exposure in media , german is school or nothing for vast majority of people , even language learning sites like duolingo are only for those actively trying to practice . 
  there 's no way we would be neutral after the war one way or another , but i guess usa 's economic help would put us on the level of germany these days . 
  do n't forget we had uranium , it was pretty hot resource after the war ended . 
  slovakia also extends pretty far to the east , `` a dagger in russias 's side '' if you want to get dramatic . 
  i wonder why tho , so many postgrad students from the east ? 
  well , czech is a beautiful language and all , but i would n't wish learning it to the tiniest detail on my worst enemy . 
  although if you work in the country , i think learning at least the basics so you can communicate at the shop , restaurant etc. 
  is common sense . 
  this is pretty common , however no doctor in their right mind would prescribe you something that could actually harm you . 
  that said , if big pharma keeps quiet about potential side effects , disasters can happen . 
  i 'm not paying much attention to czech politics ... 
  well , they need to protect their investment ... 
  i thought you can just replace it with `` ss '' for the same effect ? 
  is n't he also restricting freedom of the press ? 
  why ? 
  getting a new flag , president and name does n't fix old problems, 
  my method is to find the nearest starbucks, 
  well , i think you ca n't teach people a language , they have to learn themselves . 
  i certainly was n't taught enough to get c1 in english ( could go for c2 , but i do n't think it 's worth the money ) by others , it was mostly my effort and time - watching movies , reading books and teachers filled in some gaps in grammar , but that 's it . 
  it 's the same with other languages , i was taking 4 years of spanish , but that 's mostly useless beyond basic conversation and grammar , simply because i did n't put in the extra effort . 
  so you just speak czech , they speak slovak and it works . 
  i run into so many slovaks in czech universities and we usually make no effort to adjust our language ( except for names of the months ... ), 
  well , every single time i go shopping and i see seniors hunting for sales czech dream pops back into my mind . 
  i 'd go for czech dream personally : http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0402906/, 
  dictator stroking his ego ? 
  whoops , sorry, 
  i really hope you are trolling, 
  that kind of fits my limited experience with turkey with what i heard from others ( erasmus etc. ), 
  - every region thinks the others are weird :d, 
  there 's still the president who needs to quit, 
  ... a few things :d interesting topic !, 
  i do n't think there 's that much to know , it 's good to know the role of czechoslovakia after ww1 , because at that point it was pretty wealthy country and how the occupation by germany happened and that we actually were n't damaged that much by war compared to surrounding countries , which was one of the reasons stalin wanted us ( the other one was uranium ) and if you ever need to know why we have so many atheists - 40 years of communism , where the church was systematically destroyed and uprooted from daily life . 
  i could be russian too, 
  tbh when i was in india few years back , i just defaulted on saying i 'm from czechoslovakia , because that was the country everybody knew and it felt rather rude to correct them every single time . 
  yay for your past being greater than the present . 
  hell no , as someone who uses english every day i still like my native language . 
  should there be like 2-3 ? 
  yeah , probably , but good luck making eu decide on those . 
  zeman is . 
  since his opponent in the last elections was a muppet , i 'd still say we picked the lesser evil . 
  who else elects a troll as a president ? 
  i 'm not sure how much he has to do with any trades taking place though , our president 's duties are mostly ceremonial in addition to shitting on media and other politicians . 
  as far as i understand the weapons are not made here , so somebody is only acting as a broker , which is a lot more nebulous role and a few bribes usually go a long way . 
  sometimes it 's pretty hard to stay consistent , since i , like most people probably was taught british english , but then when you expand on that with popular media , it 's mostly american english , so in the end i end up flip-flopping between them and it makes the natives really confused . 
  you do n't even have to copy it , that was the first thing that came to my mind when i read the title, 
  yeah , do n't go drinking in norway :d, 
  still about 3x more expensive than poland or czech republic :d, 
  got my imperial units wrong , basically beer on tap is around 1 $ , less in markets, 
  i 'd sooner sell my soul than pay that for a beer 2 or i 'm going back home . 
  i would n't be so sure , last time they rolled around they self-destructed soon after, 
  almost definitely , whole eastern europe has brain drain problems, 
  not to mention people leaving eastern europe usually do so after obtaining education and skills required to work in another country . 
  that there 's already a system in place to do the exact opposite , discriminate . 
  shame there 's also a court of public opinion then . 
  well there 's a joke that czech republic is doing best when it 's ran by austrians or germans , but yeah , this is n't it . 
  i do n't think they had much of a choice , they probably paid money to get to eu in advance and this is what was waiting to pick them up . 
  it 's either kiss your savings goodbye or take the truck . 
  ah , the plug-and-play of politics, 
  nope , africa was the original asia when it comes to cheap labor ...

  just for any other document that can identify you ? 
  like others mentioned - nostalgia . 
  by any hard numbers , we are doing almost exponentially better without them , but especially the old people like the idea of state handling everything and `` free stuff '' . well duh , nobody would pay for that shit anyway, 
  crimea has sevastopol , which is one of two naval bases of russia that has access to black/mediterranean sea . 
  if ukraine decided to go to eu , they would most definitely lose it and huge part of their southern fleet . 
  i think it 's a bluff , unless their generals are insane and putin 's politic is testament that their civil leadership is rather smart . 
  the putin/erdogan approach , i see, 
  i would n't mind banning dailymail links from the subreddit , they rarely seem to be based in reality and instead fuel circlejerks, 
  no , he would have to be worse than austrians for that, 
  since most of the military guys tends to be 18-25 years , they get a pass for being stupid from me , just accept your stupidity and move on . 
  because metamphetamine is known here as pervitin with street name `` pern\u00edk '' , which is gingerbread in english , so it actually makes sense, 
  not really , but they were n't usually well managed either . 
  what got destroyed were monuments to communism , since the new head guy did n't like the past ones , which i thought would be nice to have as a reminder . 
  go north to \u00dast\u00ed nad labem or a bit more east , like teplice and you will see much worse, 
  do n't judge a country by its capital , but yeah if you stick to prague there ai n't many differences . 
  go out and you will see that it 's still not western eu , but it 's getting there . 
  i remember way more gray unkept houses and building blocs , now almost all of them have a new coat of paint , the cars are also new ... 
  anybody nostalgic for `` the old times '' needs a kick in the butt . 
  and do n't get me started on freedom of movement pre 89 .

  and so shrinking their money and influence .

  triangels are awesome . 
  plain three stripes would be boring .

   but some countries appear not to hesitate to join the eurozone . 
  well different countries have different policies . 
  some countries indeed want to join the eurozone as quickly as possible , others are avoiding it for decades ( sweden ) or simply refusing it from the beginning ( denmark and the uk ) . 
  for some it can bring a lot of benefits , for others less so . 
  public opinion plays a very big part in this , if +80 % of your public is against , then good luck trying to push for euro . 
   alabama received $ 8.2 billion of federal aid in 2013 , quite comparable to greece 's 4.7 billion euros from the eu . 
  greece is not getting aid , they get more loans with some more favourable interest rates with the condition that they will enforce austerity measures . 
  i would not really call that aid , that sounds as if greece was just given money , when in fact they were n't handed a single penny . 
  ok , so spain is recovering ( would not call that `` doing very well '' , since they still have a huge level of unemployment , but fine ) . 
  i do n't get your point with the us . 
  us is a country , eurozone is not a country . 
  we already established the monetary union without a fiscal union issue . 
  the us does not have this issue . 
  so naturally the us states do n't need to devalue their currency , since they are compensated through the common budget . 
  this does not work in eurozone . 
  the baltics are in a different position , they are the most vulnerable eu countries from the geopolitical perspective so they need to keep the closest possible ties with the eu core countries . 
  when i said non-euro countries , i meant countries which currently do n't have euro , i did n't count the baltics in them . 
  for them joining euro made a lot of sense . 
  of course we 're also not in the safest spot , that 's why i mentioned earlier that we might join if it looks like we might get excluded from some important activities . 
  if that 's the case then i would be for joining , because the risks of staying behind would be higher than the possible risks of being in eurozone . 
  but for now , it 's not necessary to join . 
  i do n't see why we should not wait before the italy situation gets sorted out . 
  well the conditions in spain , italy or portugal might not be critical , but these countries are stagnating for years and years . 
  a few cee countries have already jumped ahead of greece and portugal and spain and italy are not that far ahead . 
  of course devaluing currency is not a solution to everything , but it 's one of the tools you can use when you 're in crisis . 
  in eurozone this tool is not available . 
  and it does n't actually have to be just an emergency solution , for example switzerland has been devaluing their currency for quite a long time , before stopping this policy in 2015 , would you say their economy is not competitive ? 
  overall i just do n't think it 's a good idea to lose the authority over your curreny unless you 're compensated in another way . 
  eurozone right now is just not a very attractive prospect , specially since no one knows what 's going to happen in italy in the future , since their banks seem to need a huge bailout . 
  and this is not just a small greece anymore , this is one of the biggest economies in europe . 
  wait and see is the best tactics for us right now ( also for other non-euro countries ) . 
  i do n't think anybody would really argue about the convenience of euro when traveling . 
  but the thing is , most czechs go abroad once or twice a year ( not neccesarily to eurozone countries ) , some do n't go at all . 
  not that many czechs shop at foreign websites either . 
  so they can live pretty easily without euro . 
  what they witness instead is crisis after crisis , be it greece , spain , portugal or now italy . 
  the fact is that eurozone is a fundamentally flawed project - a monetary union without a fiscal union , which leaves weaker eurozone economies ( southern european countries ) without the possibilty to devalue their currency and boost their economy and without a common budget to compensate for this inconsistency . 
  without this being repaired , i do n't want us to join . 
  our currency is working fine for us , i agree that euro certainly could bring many benefits , but we do n't need it to survive . 
  joining eurozone is not happening here anytime soon . 
  we already do fulfill all the economic criteria , so now it is a political decision . 
  the public support is absolutely minimal though , so politicians are not willing to push for it ( even the pro-eu ones ) . 
  they are not even setting any dates ( which they did in the past and then kept postponing it ) , instead they give vague conditions , for example that our salaries have to be on a similar level to german ones ( that 's like a polite way to say `` lol , forget it , we 're never ever getting euro '' ) . 
  the only way i see us accepting euro , despite massive public opposition , would be if the eurozone moved to a closer union and we would have a pro-eu government in power during that time , which would not want to risk staying behind . 
  but even without the euro , the prices are probably gon na go up anyway . 
  at least our central bank is definitely trying to push for some mild inflation with their monetary policy . 
  i checked the statistics at eurostat , because i was n't sure how trustworthy numbeo is , turns out that lithuania and hungary are cheaper than us . 
  estonia , slovakia , slovenia , latvia , croatia are more expensive . 
  euro definitely plays some part in this , though i do n't know how big that part is in each country . 
  i would like to give you some sophisticated explanation about the price level in cz , but i 'm not an economist , so i do n't want to throw in some random theories . 
  all i can say really is that i have a lot of slovak friends who often bitch about how expensive bratislava is and how it got worse with euro , which the numbers seem to be confirming ( even though in other ways euro also helped slovak economy , it 's of course not black and white ) . 
  i guess so . 
  but in the czech republic vs slovakia example the currency really was the main factor though . 
  bratislava is now more expensive than prague . 
  it 's actually so expensive that many young slovaks find it more affordable to live in brno ( in cz ) and take a train every day to bratislava ( about 1,5 hour ) to work . 
  so sometimes having low prices really can be linked to having your own currency . 
  but that 's just not universaly true . 
  we have a lower cost of living ( well according to numbeo at least ) than estonia , slovenia , slovakia , hungary , croatia , lithuania and latvia , yet in gdp per capita ppp ( which takes purchase power into consideration ) we 're ahead of all these countries . 
  i 'm sure you could find other exceptions to this `` low cost of life = low standard of living/low purchase power '' rule . 
  well if by standard of living you mean the human development index , than we 're at 28th place ( in the world ) and slovaks are at 35th . 
  it is actually true that the prices went up in slovakia with the acception of euro , mainly in the bratislava region . 
  yeah , i feel bad for them as well . 
  on the other hand , this whole thing is nothing new really . 
  when a migrant moves to a country which is significantly richer than his home country , some people will just always look down on him . 
  or there does n't even have to be a significant wealth gap , only the perception ( from the local population ) that there is a significant wealth gap ( i.e. 
  the locals feel like the the migrant comes from a poor country ) is enough . 
  this happens everywhere in the world , including the eastern europe ( many people here look down on ukrainians and then proceed to complain that western europeans look down on us ) . 
  we can of course complain about this behaviour , i personally find it disgusting , but that 's about all we can do . 
  a migrant moving to a richer country should better grow a thicker skin , or he is doomed to be unpleasantly surprised . 
  the problem with the uk though is that some brits seem like they took this feeling of superiority to another level - to open hatred . 
   may i ask why you take offence at the fact more people voted out than in ? 
  could be because some people , specially here in eastern europe , took personally the fact that the leave campaign used our fellow countrymen who moved to the uk to flame hate against all eastern europeans . 
  it 's kinda hard to not take it personally when you know that the dislike of our countries/our people was one of the main factors why brits voted to leave . 
  do n't get me wrong , i respect the decision of british people , but you ca n't really be surprised that not all people here took it so lightly , specially since brexit was followed by racist/xenophobic attacks on foreigners . 
  so it 's really the kind of `` you do n't like me , so i do n't like you either '' reaction . 
   i 'm glad the uk is leaving . 
  this is a huge reason why so many millions voted to leave too . 
  well if that was the main reason , than it was really stupid . 
  the eu never forced the uk to take any refugees , the uk opted out of the quota system and had schengen in place . 
  your problematic muslims immigrants who were running the horrible rape gangs ( in rotherham and so ) were actually from former commonwealth countries , namely from pakistan , so i do n't see how that 's the eu 's fault . 
  you have yourself to blame for accepting them/failing to integrate them/failing to stop them from what they were doing in time . 
  it 's really weird that you point out to germany , when you have the very same problems in your own country as well . 
  i was always wondering what 's the point of israel not openly admitting that you have nukes , when everybody already knows that you have them . 
  i mean , i understand why it was kept a secret at the beginning , but why now ? 
  india and pakistan are also not hiding the fact . 
  it had a similar effect on me . 
  not that i was ever anti-eu , but i tended to take the eu for granted . 
  brexit reminded me how vulnerable this whole system of european integration is and that we must stick together if we do n't want to lose it . 
  a few polish redditors might be pissed at the uk ( perhaps the recent attacks on poles in the uk might have something to do with this ) , but that does n't mean that the entire poland is all for tough stance in brexit negotiation . 
  in fact all cee countries have been pretty upset that the uk is leaving , we understand we 're losing a country which was often our ally in the eu . 
  actually you could hear several frustrated voices from cee countries calling for juncker to resign , blaming him that he did n't do enough to prevent the uk from leaving . 
  i really wish this could all get reversed , but since it 's not possible , we do have to take care of ourselves now . 
  and the fact is that losing the uk sucks big time for us , but losing or weakening the eu by accomodating british demands ( i.e. 
  letting them having access to the single market without the freedom of movement ) would suck even more . 
  i do n't think this is a tough stance though , it 's just pragmatic . 
  it 's not in our power to keep the uk from disintegrating , if the scots or irish decide to leave . 
  you have put yourself in this situation , it 's really unfortunate , but there 's really nothing we can do . 
  i agree with you on pretty much everything you said , do n't know what to add really . 
  maybe you can send this to your friends in brussels , so that they know what to do ? 
  but no , seriously , even though i have no inside knowledge whatsoever about how it really works in the eu institutions , i find it hard to believe that there could be stupid/incompetent people working there .

  russia has lost its drive to be a sane functioning country a long time ago . 
  how can the church protect you from the mob ? 
  are there shotgun wielding gangs of priests roaming the streets ? 
  i also think duty to rescue * is * better , but i have learned a long time ago that arguing with a briton that something continental is better is a lost cause . 
  so i chose to attack from the * outdated * angle , 
  well , the greek alphabet is pretty useful in maths !, 
  well , that technology in that tv that detects whether the channel works or not and displays the blank screen is digital too , as opposed to analogue tv that displays the * granulation * ( zrn\u011bn\u00ed ) . 
  but we have to make it costly to him , so next time he perhaps finds a less damaging gambit . 
  i did n't say better , i said outdated . 
  it might have been great when people were peasants , but it does n't fit into an era of cpr courses , cell phones and skilled 122 operators . 
  revision is needed . 
  well , since civil law is newer and most civil law countries do have the duty to rescue , i 'd wager a guess that the outdated attitude is the one of the common law . 
  and no , i believe more good than harm is the norm , hence why it 's practised in most countries on this planet . 
  and remember , you are to follow instructions of a professional operator , if there 's any indication of a spinal injury ( like in a car crash ) , they wo n't tell you to jump on his spine . 
  and that 's exactly because you do n't have the duty to rescue and the necessary corresponding good faith laws . 
  since doing basic cpr is n't really hard and can make a big difference . 
  i myself saved a life with that , there ca n't be a better argument than that . 
  everybody knows common law has weird quirks due to its evolution , but god damn people , this is something you can change . 
  ** 1 ** : i have already saved one person 's life on the street -- an old man had a heart attack and so i called 112 and using their instructions started cpr , his blue head turned pink again and when the ambulance arrived they were able to restart his heart and he survived . 
  so , really , you do n't need your own judgement , you need a phone and instructions of the operator . 
  everybody can at least call . 
  ** 2 ** : when doing your duty to rescue , you are protected by `` good faith '' laws -- if you are helping in good faith , you are not liable for any complications arising from your help . 
  so that passage you quoted about endangering your life only applies to things like helping someone while in a gun fight or a burning building . 
  wow !, 
  [ duty to rescue ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/duty_to_rescue ) -- so while in the vast majority of * civil law * countries you * do * have a mandated duty to rescue , in most * common law * countries , you indeed do not !, 
  i think that 's horrendous . 
  edit : a very illustrating case law from the wikipedia article :  in the 1907 case , people v. beardsley , beardsley 's mistress , blanche burns , passed out after overdosing on morphine . 
  rather than seek medical attention , beardsley instead had a friend hide her in the basement , and burns died a few hours later . 
  beardsley was tried and convicted of manslaughter for his negligence . 
  however , his conviction was reversed by the supreme court of michigan saying that beardsley had no legal obligation to her . 
  ok , i 'm kinda scared of your laws then . 
  in the czech republic you * absolutely * are legally obligated to call an ambulance and render help if someone is dying close to you , and if you fail to do so ( given reasonable possibility ) , you can go to jail for that . 
  i do n't agree with that definition . 
  you could call * anything * compulsive slavery then . 
  like if someone besides you is dying , you are obligated to call an ambulance for him . 
  slavery ? 
  or having to go and pay taxes . 
  slavery ? 
  just my two cents . 
  hey , you do n't have to work in a prison . 
  so it works . 
  well , no . 
  we have a sense of humour . 
  put them to jail * and * tax them . 
  bi-winning . 
  my bad !, 
  so they categorize it as slavery even though they get paid , it 's for a limited time and it does n't discriminate based on race or religion ? 
  that 's even stranger than i thought . 
  oh yeah , i often forget how religious qu\u00e9bec was before the quiet revolution . 
  i really wish qu\u00e9bec got its independence , they get shafted by the anglos so mercilessly , but it is not to be . 
  where do you live ? 
  mine too !, 
  and i remember reading about trouble with conscientious objectors during the ww1 when french canadians did n't want to go to war because they felt france had abandoned them century earlier ( which it indeed did ) . 
  there was shooting on the streets i believe . 
  were you referring to this ? 
  i * do * have some sympathy with conscientious objectors , do n't get me wrong . 
  but if there 's the option of civil service , which is in no way related to the military and thus you ca n't abstain based on your conscientious objection , then if the individual still refuses he should be severely punished . 
  people , he is a coward , but that does n't mean he should be downvoted , it 's a valid opinion . 
  since there 's the option for civil service instead of military one , i think 2 years jail for refusing is appropriate ( even for jehova 's lunatics ) . 
  they do need to tackle the sexual discrimination issue though . 
  hope they wo n't need a fourth one !, 
  that happens in so called `` closed economies '' , i.e. 
  economies that are self sufficient . 
  the czech republic is one of the most * open economies * in the world , and so this multiplication factor is severely mitigated . 
  the czech republic is actually more reliant on falls of gdp in germany than falls of gdp in the actual czech republic . 
  what a funny world . 
  of course , but a downturn does n't mean you suddenly go from 100 % production to 0 % production . 
  say in a quite severe downturn you start making 25 % less cars , so gdp drops by 1.75 % , while our current annual growth is above that . 
  they have the assembling facilities , but what is important today for a brand are the r&d and design capacities . 
  well , it 's nowhere as concentrated as detroit -- detroit was a one city that was basically making all the cars for 300 millions of americans . 
  this is nowhere as large in absolute numbers , it 's not concentrated in one place and it is n't such an astounding proportion of gdp as it was in detroit . 
  downturn might slow the gdp growth a bit . 
  i 'm pretty sure that is expressly * not * the case for malm\u00f6 . 
  for instance , they had a 7th grenade attack in the city just in recent history . 
  overall malm\u00f6 now is a shadow of its former self . 
  i 'm sure there are some that emigrate and are neither affluent nor educated , but i believe the majority do come from the upper classes . 
  especially migrants that are coming from countries that are further away . 
  because , how many dirt poor africans have several thousand dollars to be smuggled over the mediterranean ? 
   what makes you think these [ beheadings ] are such a possibility ? 
  simply the presence of muslims ? 
  the fact that beheadings * do happen * and * are attempted * there makes me think it is such a possibility . 
   i say this mainly because while there are people like you who see no benefit to immigration , changes have already happened that are n't reversible . 
  that is very true -- for western europe . 
  but the entirety of former eastern europe has n't been affected by this , and the citizens thereof see these immigration policies as irreversible failures and do n't want to repeat the same mistakes . 
  : i did not downvote you . 
  i 'm in no way saying beheadings are a daily occurrence , do n't get me wrong , i 'm not paranoid . 
  but the fact that beheadings are a * possibility * in the british capital in the 21st century does n't sit with me right . 
  neither does the fact that there is a sizeable group of people in western europe today wanting to enforce sharia law in their communities . 
  overall , there are studies that indicate homogeneous countries are doing better in most aspects of civil and economic life and so from my selfish point of view i see no benefit to immigration for my country . 
  and last but perhaps the most important reason i am against economic migration is not selfish but , i hope , caring . 
  there are over 3 billion people today living in desperate poverty . 
  europe ca n't possibly take even 5 % of that in our lifetimes . 
  and the problem is , those people who * do * emigrate are those that * can * emigrate . 
  the affluent people , the educated ones . 
  the ones that could bring about change in their countries of origin had they not emigrated . 
  the people that could possibly lessen the suffering of those 95 % instead of leaving them desperate in perpetuity . 
  it 's not necessarily about punctuality ( although there are no problems with that in brno ) , it 's an overall greatness . 
  there is really an enormous number of lines , so for 99 % of journeys you only need to transfer once to travel between any two points within the city . 
  the transit is also * very fast * , thanks to heavy use of trams , exclusive lanes for trolleybuses and buses , and overall non-existent traffic , so the transit moves very swiftly . 
  also thanks to almost everybody taking the public transit , there 's a tram/bus coming every few minutes , so waiting is never an issue .

  just a quick heads up : if you consider everyone that does n't agree that the annexation of sudetenland was rightful , a nationalist , then you might as well consider 99 % of the czech population nationalist . 
  nobody is going to grow out of that . 
  i never said that my country did nothing wrong . 
  i accept that the atrocities that happened during the expulsion are inexcusable and that the expulsion itself was based on collective guilt . 
  however i wo n't ever accept that it was rightful for hitler to take any part of czechoslovakia . 
  if you think i 'm a nationalist because of that , then fine , i do n't really care . 
  i remember i already discussed the sudetengerman issue with you and i really do n't feel like getting into it again , sorry . 
  i understand germans ( specially those of sudetendeutsche origins ) who stress the unfairness of the post-war expulsion . 
  a collective guilt was applied against the sudetengermans and that was wrong . 
  however i have little understanding for those who think that act of breaking up my country was legit and that sudetengermans were all just victims who had every right to support the annexation , because the lands were n't really czech . 
  and even if we accepted this , it was still no excuse for supporting hitler . 
  they lived in a free democratic country and had access to information . 
  hitler was n't keeping his views secret . 
  whoever was still voluntarily supporting him in 1938 is to blame . 
  i do n't really have anything else to tell you , since you evidently do n't even have any respect for the czech state in its rightful borders and thus it 's not really possible for me to have a normal discussion with you . 
  i tried that before and it did n't work out . 
  well obviously it was too late by then . 
  the uk and france have totally misread hitler and his intentions . 
  it was n't just that they did nothing to stop the annexation of sudetenland , they even endorsed the annexation by signing the munich agreement . 
  they literaly agreed with him taking over the sudetenland where the vast majority of czech military was stationed . 
  well then do n't complain when the consequences of this ` i 'll vote for anyone who changes the status quo ' hit you in your face , when that anyone clearly is someone with extreme racist views , with a complete disregard for democracy , with big militaristic ambitions and who clearly does n't even attempt to hide his absolute contempt for certain nationalities/ethnicities and who is totally open about viewing them as subhumans . 
  they never should have let hitler take bohemia and moravia . 
  even ignoring the ethical side of it , it was still a very bad move . 
  bohemia and moravia were at that point well armed and all of this weaponry went to germany and was later used against france . 
  it was also a heavily industrial area that ended up producing a large portion of german weaponry - cca 1/3 of it by the end of war . 
  which was btw also one of the reasons why germany did n't behave as horribly here as they did in poland - they were worried that being too brutal could cause large-scale rebellions and that would disrupt the production . 
  basically my point is that the allies made some very bad decisions , not just from the ethical but also from the pragmatic point of view that later came to bite them in their ass . 
  if hitler was stopped in 1938 , then who knows how would european modern history look like . 
  oh , come on , it 's not like hitler was hiding his deeply racist views ... i mean when was mein kampf published , sometimes around 1920s ? 
  there were like bazillion warning red flags flying around hitler . 
  do n't tell me that sudeten germans did n't know that the annexation will have very severe consequences for their czech neighbours . 
  many of them were also welcoming the german troops when they were taking the rest of the bohemia and moravia . 
  yeah , of course , if you 're unhappy with the country you live in , the only choice you have is to support a genocidal maniac / s. 
  yeah , i take all the percetion indexes with a grain of salt . 
  it 's been also documented that typically countries which try to actively fight corruption often drop in these indexes , purely because there are more scandals getting on the surface , while countries which might have a comparable level of corruption , but do n't try to tackle it , are higher on the index . 
  also i sometimes wonder if we countries or the us , who are doing very good on the index , are actually doing that good in reality or if it is n't just that their corruption is more nuanced and sophisticated ( for example in the form of lobbying ) and their populations tend to be more trusting of their authorities , while in cee countries , people are just extremely cynical about politics . 
  perhaps this distorts the final index a little bit . 
  well your original post seemed to suggest that it 's a fact that they can use the reunification laws , or at least that 's how i understood it . 
  so i just wanted to point out that they wo n't be able to do that . 
  of course i agree that what they believe they will be able to do is something entirely different . 
  most of asylum seekers tend to have a completely distorted view of europe and germany in particular . 
  so yeah , i can see that they think they 'll be able to bring their families over , but it 's not gon na happen for the vast majority of them . 
  at least not legally . 
  yeah , i know you just used that as an example . 
  sorry if i sounded like i was nit-picking . 
  it 's actually really diffucult to determine which country is better/worse at corruption , since all we have are so-called `` corruption perception indexes '' , but as you said , it depends on what people in that specific country perceive as corruption , how sensitive they 're to it and also how well-hidden and sophisticated the corruption is . 
  i just wanted to point out that in general , we have problems with corruption in politics as well , we 're no way immune to it . 
   what if they have no papers and no evidence ? 
  but just claim to be from syria etc ? 
  usually it 's not that unrealistic to find plot holes in the stories of migrants who pretend to come from a different country . 
  the first basic clue is obviously the looks , if a black man from , say , nigeria , claims to be syrian , then that 's immediately going to raise a suspicion . 
  the authorities responsible for handling asylum cases also mostly have interpreters with them , who are familiar with the local languages and dialects , so they will see if the person who claims to be from syria ca n't actually speak the dialect of the arabic language that a person coming from whatever part of syria he/she claims to be , should speak . 
  and even ignoring languages and looks , it 's actually not that easy to come up with a solid consistent story , specially if you have no documents to back the story up . 
  the authorities are trained to handle these situations , so they can find inconsistencies in your testimony relatively easily . 
  of course it 's possible that some people might just slip through . 
  specially in the type of situation as in 2015 , when masses of people , literaly hundreds of thousands , come at once . 
  but in general the main problem is n't that authorities hand out asylum to anyone that asks , but that they 're unable to deport the rejected applicants . 
  that 's the main issue . 
  yeah , i know . 
  i have even read an article ( do n't remember where now ) about the phenomenon of men-free african villages , which nowadays virtually consist of women , children and old people , because all the young men in the productive age left either to europe or to the big cities in africa . 
  and while i realize that their behaviour is quite logical ( i mean , if they care at all about their wifes/sisters/daughters , they will absolutely not let them make the journey to europe , since for men it might be very dangerous , but for women , it 's absolute hell ) , it does n't mean that i 'm going to ignore that receiving that many young men is simply very problematic for europe . 
  even ignoring that they come from highly conservative areas , often with very distorted views of european women , which then results in the sexual attacks that we have been witnessing in the past few years in we countries , young men are simply statistically more likely to commmit crimes . 
  not just sexual crimes , but all kinds of crime . 
  so it 's perfectly valid to prioritize families over singly men when choosing who to accept . 
  what ? 
  when someone applies for asylum , it is n't up to the authorities to prove that he/she is n't a refugee . 
  on the contrary , it 's up to the person to provide a plausible testimony and evidence that would prove that he/she qualifies for a refugee status as it is definied in the geneva conventions . 
  for instance , countries usually have a list of ` safe countries ' which are found not to significantly breach human rights and persecute its citizens , so anyone who comes from one of these safe countries can have its application denied with the explanation that it is clearly based on unreasonable grounds . 
  many of these men come exactly from these ` safe countries ' , so unless they can provide evidence of being personally persecuted , which the vast majority of them ca n't , they will be denied . 
  of course it 's another thing that they often are n't deported even though their application is denied , but that does n't mean they can ( legally ) bring their family over . 
   to give an example to what / u/austinvonrivia is saying , because redditors from romania may have different expectation of what corruption is vs someone from czechia : i just wanted to add that the practice of putting like-minded people in non-political functions in state-owned or partly state-owned companies ( like the czech post service , czech national railway service etc. ), 
  is not uncommon over here as well . 
  what ? 
  when did v4 block frontex ? 
  frontex existed way before the refugee crisis even started . 
  eu countries have reunification laws for recognized refugees . 
  and even in their case it 's increasingly more difficult to bring their family over . 
  those men coming from africa overwhelmingly do n't qualify for a refugee status , they wo n't be able to legally bring their families over . 
   it takes time to adjust to the whole `` european idea '' and it 's not just politicians , nations too . 
  when portugal and spain first joined they were somewhat plagued by similar problems . 
  good point , however the thing is that at least from my perspective , i do n't see much progress in embracing the ` european idea ' over here . 
  if anything , the trend is more so the opposite . 
  the 90s and early 00s were all about ` back to europe ' in foreign policy , but this consensus is now gone . 
  and the truth is that even back then , the eu-hype was based on inaccurate information and unrealistic expectations . 
  it was n't really the actual ` european idea ' that ` clicked ' with people over here . 
  it was the promise that we 'll reach western european living standards , that we 'll be able to travel on vacations without border checks and that our young people will have more opportunities than they parents and grandparents . 
  so i 'm not really sure whether more time will do the trick here . 
  there really is n't that much ideological kind of love for the eu among the people here . 
  it was more so a marriage of convenience . 
  the eu is largely seen here as a distant bureaucratic something totally disconnected from the lives of the average citizens and i think the big problem is that people here did n't accept it as ` our project ' too , but more so as something that we joined , but do n't really have any influence within it . 
  there 's just this weird mental barrier which i think is n't really there so strongly in we , but we for example have that in common with brits . 
  in we ( not counting the uk ) the eu is largely seen as something that is ` yours ' and that your nations shape and so your people can identify with it . 
  but in the uk , this was never the case , the eu was always a foreign element , and this is similar in my country , only in the case of the uk , a big part of the british public had straighout hostile attitude to the eu , while czechs just tend to be largely indifferent . 
  in the other new member states , the attitudes towards the eu are more positive than in the czech republic , but from my experience , it 's in general a bit more superficial than in the we . 
  the eu is connected with protection , economic prosperity , eu funds , freedom of movement and other perks , so again the bases of this positive attitude are pragmatic , not emotional/ideological . 
  but then none of this really excuses our politicians acting incompetent within the eu . 
  regardless of what our public 's relation to the eu is , we are simply now a part of it , so we might as well try to make most of it . 
  or you know , that should be our politicians ' jobs , but god damn , they just suck at foreign policy so bad sometimes . 
  to be fair though , i do n't really blame we for trying to follow their particular goals . 
  it 's not like we 're behaving differently .

  its sucessor countries are better than if they stayed in defunct federation . 
  multinational states like austria-hungary never did very well . 
  czechs were ruled for almost 300 years by habsburgs who attempted to germanize them . 
  slovaks survived even longer time under the hungarians . 
  til russia still has battleships . 
   i do n't know where this 15-20 % comes from . 
  he probably thinks about long term decline . 
  czech republic went almost bankrupt in 1997 , but this was more due to recent foolish economic policy than to dissolution of federal state .

    in germany they at least do not have to fear . 
   what makes you think so ? 
  i doubt in germany almost everyone thinks ( and talks ) how they have to be expelled or worse . 
  i doubt there are daily reports in media about their criminality making it worse and worse . 
  also germany is not close to bankrupcy like the czech republic . 
  frankly , they are not doing well in central and eastern europe and there will be almost certainly mass violence against them in the future . 
  in germany they at least do not have to fear .

  the picture is wrong for the czech republic . 
  all current reactors are of vver ( soviet ) design , though they were built locally , by skoda works . 
  czechoslovakia was once big in nuclear industry , it even had its own reactor . 
  the two newly planned reactors are not decided yet . 
  there are also three small research reactors , in and near prague . 
  slovakia is wrong for the same reason . 
  both poland and the czech republic plan to build devices ( transformers , perhaps there 's a more exact technical term ) to protect themselves against surplus now pushed through their networks , for free .

  compare someone already speaking indoeuropean language ( czech , slovak or romani ) with a somali speaking semitic language and make far reaching conclusions . 
  fun aside : couple of teachers from this school visited czech republic few years ago . 
  they probably saw themselves as missionaries preaching to cannibals and presented themselves with a big-mouthed pseudo-religious diatribes . 
  it generated few amused comments in local media . 
   60 % of the total population had no more than primary school education !, 
  this is like something out of the 19th century . 
  yes , it is . 
  find some photo gallery how gypsies live in slums of eastern slovakia . 
  medieval peasants were more sophisticated and enlightened . 
  are you still suprised by poor school results ? 
  take a different look . 
  that horrible system had managed to give 40 % of gypsies some kind of secondary educations . 
  find some other country able to do this without resorting to `` diploma mill '' shortcut . 
   you could have given them remedial help , or even introduced mandatory nursery school education . 
  what is you experience in special education ? 
  do you believe nobody thought about that and nobody had tried ? 
  some things are simply not possible , no matter how much you dream . 
   there 's a case study of 60 roma kids ... ( source ) this paper was debunked . 
  basically , they put kids from those horrible czech special schools into even worse british schools and suprise , suprise , what they learned in czech schools made them something as local stars in britain . 
   you have created , through a de facto segregated education system yes and the segregated system actually worked . 
  it produced much better result than the modern shitty schools unable to teach anything . 
  there were no miracles but sorry , that 's not fault of the czechs . 
  the former regime ( the communists ) , for all their faults , did one thing right , they believed the future belongs to them and good education is the key .

  it would be nice to have our banks and water infrastructure back in czech hands . 
  or maybe we should secure the border . 
  btw . 
  what will europe do if there would be some syria civil war scenario in turkey or egypt and something like 50m refugees ? 
  no deal is better than bad deal :d we can be part of of efta and schengen . 
  what about denmark or sweden ? 
  i see . 
  so we should make some ninja warrior track for refugees . 
  so actually only the strongest one can apply for asylum . 
  thats some ancient rome shit . 
  lets make some reality show . 
  we send 10m $ and 500 policemans , 
  can we put some taxes on dividents going from czechia to we ? 
   and you ca n't keep refugees out by force what about that 10m high fence in spanish enclaves in africa ??? 
  i guess spain is racist and bigot country too, 
   by your people since when is eastern european a ethnicity ?? 
  damn , you western europans are so arrogant, 
  we have them too , yup overpriced af but they have great cakes, 
  there are 8k muslims in whole country so the 2nd generation is not really problem here . 
  it would change fast with 3k/year forced immigration refugee quota from italy , greece etc. 
  so in 10 years with some reuniuons ( 3x ) syrians will be the largest minority in our country . 
  sorry but nope . 
  as a jewish person with two little kids we should really stop any immigration from mena region to czechia . 
  better safe than few euros from eu funds . 
  spanish 11 % is like german 5 %, 
  same here . 
  1 % of german growth automaticly transform to 0.5 % our growth without any effort . 
  its more like toilet paper drachma or euro . 
  and if you think that bankrupcy is so great ask someone from argentina or russia . 
   if instead greece in 2009 bankrupted it would be now on the path of growth , possibly with higher gdp per capita , than it has now . 
  citation needed . 
  imho you would have toilet paper currency , mass riots ( medicaments too expansive etc ) and gdp nominal around serbia level . 
  thats nice but just the rents in prague went up by 9 % in 1q, 
  we need some nicname for slovenia now . 
  alpine tiger or balkan tiger ? 
  strong and stable strong and stable strong and stable strong and stable lalalala, 
  czechmate https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/moldauhafen, 
  rule bohemia !, 
  bohemia rule the waves !, 
  that 's the joke do you remember western european terrorist breivik ? 
  you guys are really crazy . 
  than talk only about these nationalities . 
  why put 350m people in one basket ? 
  damn you western europeans are so xenofobic . 
  imho the best way how to fight with negative stereotypes is with humour , 
  meh 2,9 % is too low . 
  we should aim for 4 % at least . 
  the biggest problem is our construction sector due to unprepered projects from the goverment . 
  just the city of prague failed to spend 250m $ to infrastructure last year and it takes 8 years to build a appartment house in prague . 
  so the demand for new appartments in prague is 7k/year but they actaully build only 2k . 
  good job nimby . 
  oh and our central bank somehow accumluated 120bn $ with the currency cap . 
  all time low ?

  self-serving czech franchise pub with tank pilsner is in berlin  http://www.thepub.cz/?lng=de, 
  6 pubs in london  http://tankpilsnerurquell.com/, 
  2 beers/day are reccommeded by doctors , 
  1.5 years ? 
  nah your prices are like 10 years old . 
  i 'm not sure . 
  charging tourist 100 % more is already a lot . 
  charging them more is imho unethical . 
  pilsen type of beer was invented by german  before 1840 , the standard beer in bohemia was top-fermented and characterized by a dark colour , turbidity , and inconsistent quality . 
  plze\u0148 burghers had not found this satisfying and the plze\u0148 city council ordered 36 casks to be dumped . 
  they invested in a new , state-of-the art brewery , the b\u00fcrgerbrauerei ( town brewery , m\u011b\u0161\u0165ansk\u00fd pivovar in czech ) , and commissioned josef groll , a bavarian brewer , to develop a better beer . 
  on 5 october 1842 , groll had an entirely new mash ready and on 11 november 1842 , the new beer was first served at the feast of saint martin markets . 
  sounds like communism to me , 
  from bottle or tap ? 
  try pilsner urquell from tank . 
  yeah its our instant buy for weekend in summer house . 
  one bottle of kozel is 0.3 usd in supermarkets . 
  1.30 usd is normal price in prague . 
  in touristy areas its 2 usd . 
  in countryside 0.80 usd . 
  groceries and alcohol is cheaper in poland . 
   taste nah , that 's not true, 
  i always thought that consensus is that czechia have best pilsners and belgium have best specials . 
  he edited it . 
  it was 20 , 
  he is becherovka guy . 
  these prices are from pub tho, 
  average wage in oslo is 30k usd/month ? 
  beer belly is a myth . 
  beer is actually very healthy and full of minerals . 
  honestly its quite sad because these unlucky deported ukranians have ban for several years to the schengen area . 
  nope . 
  two months ago there was a huge medialized cause about one online supermarket werehouse in prague full of ukranians with karta polaka . 
  the owner argued that accroding to this precedens it is ok . [ articles 56 tfeu and 57 tfeu must be interpreted as precluding legislation of a member state , such as that at issue in the main proceedings , under which , where workers who are nationals of non-member countries are made available by an undertaking established in another member state to a user undertaking established in the first member state , which uses them to carry out work on behalf of another undertaking established in the same member state , such making available is subject to the condition that those workers have been issued with work permits . 
  ] ( http://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document.jsf;jsessionid=9ea7d2dc30d5998de11921044962bc57fcbfc4bff427.e34kaxilc3qmb40rch0saxyla3j0?text=&amp;docid=159083&amp;pageindex=0&amp;doclang=en&amp;mode=req&amp;dir=&amp;occ=first&amp;part=1&amp;cid=80715 ) its a huge mess because for example prague police is deporting them while other cities not . 
  anyway there were some interviews from people from big agencies and they said that polish agencies are moving hundreds of thousends them around europe . 
  according to the precendens it is possible only for 3 months . 
  so they spend 3 month for example in germany and than they move back to poland . 
  after 3 months in poland they can go to another country again . 
  actaully there are ten of thousends of ukranians working in czechia with `` poles card '' . 
  and your agencies are moving them all around the europe . 
  so lot of students and seniors are working in uk ? 
  employment rate is probably better http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/images/f/f3/employment_rate%2c_age_group_20%e2%80%9364%2c_2015_%28%25%29_yb16_iii.png,

  `` we have nothing to lose , they both sucks '' - bernie supporter august 2016,

  macron could poach these . 
  le pen voters are for the most part quite single/dual issue , but are also heavily attracted by more left-wing economic policies . 
  if macron convinces them that he will make life easier for small businesses and socially disadvantaged , he could get them to swing . 
  macron vs melenchon would imo be the best 2nd round . 
  melenchon is too bolshevik for me , but i think he could sway macron to adopt slightly more left-of-center policies . 
  according to geographical definition cyprus is n't in europe and kazakhstan is the 11th largest european country ( 10 % of 2.7 mil sq km puts it above britain ) . 
  georgia in my view is certainly european , as are the other caucasus countries and turkey . 
   beer and pornstars i guess we need to make do with what we have . 
  alcohol and amateur porn are n't so bad . 
  oh my god is mammi that brown shit that tastes like dates but does n't actually contain any dates ? 
  imo university should be paid in order to restrict exactly what you say . 
  you charge a good price , but you have income-related bursaries , as well as academic scholarships , with loans taking care of the rest . 
  something like in the uk , except the discounts should be larger . 
  currently they 'll usually shave off around # 3k max . 
  you can often do an integrated masters which qualifies also as free tuition . 
  that 's true . 
  even without the ukrainian thing , it 's illegal to treat eu students pricewise as anything but your own ( unless you 're scottish , welsh , or northern irish ) . 
  yeah british unis are the only ones in europe that can on the whole stand up to the american ones in terms of research power . 
  expensive as fuck , but the organisation is incredible . 
  we 're ranked higher than slovakia internationally . 
  we 're obviously better . 
  considering there 's 100k of ukrainians in cz i would 've expected something more than `` best beer . '', 
  if we are going geographically then cyprus is not europe which is a ridiculous assumption . 
  also 10 % of kazakhstan is in europe . 
  that 10 % is bigger than like 2/3 of the countries in europe . 
  egypt has far far fewer political , economic , historical or cultural ties to europe than turkey . 
  kazakhstan has a greater case for europe than egypt . 
  how is it not ? 
  it 's part of the council of europe and an eu candidate country . 
  internationally it 's categorised almost always as europe . 
  it 's got far closer relations with europe than the me . 
  just because they have lots of muslims does n't make it not european . 
  disclaimer : i believe europe is defined as the council of europe + vatican & belarus . 
  turkey is undoubtedly a country with ties to europe that go back a long long way . 
  they 're part of many european organisations and the eu has recognised them as being a country with a european outlook ( at least back when they became a candidate country ) . 
  we need to make sure turkey will not veer off and crash because they 're such an incredibly important ally to us . 
  turkey has everything to do with europe . 
  germany economically is a global player . 
  4th largest gdp in the world . 
  while it may not have a big army or population , it certainly is a powerhouse . 
  i do n't think it will . 
  copenhagen is currently one of the dominant biotech hubs of the world and the danes will lobby hard to get the ema to come to them . 
  huh i did not know this . 
  i live across the channel in denmark , and i would never think swedish girls would be different . 
  girls in denmark are for the most part practically identical to each other in terms of looks and dress . 
  a bit eerie imo , though they 're still pretty hot on average . 
  ah yes , you must be talking about the famous czech scientist , mikul\u00e1\u0161 kopern\u00edk . 
  poor bulgaria :( we still love you < 3 !, 
  i had my arab mate take the arabs vs other people test on here : https://implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/takeatest.html strong automatic bias preferring `` other people '' to arabs lol,

  what do they want from this ? 
  no really , what is the end goal ? 
  you 're not going to convince israel to withdraw like this . 
   as of year 2012 data from 5 years ago is somehow relevant today . 
  like greece using their bailout money on their pension funds ... 
  albania ? 
  they 're pretty chill . 
  communism was actually pretty effective at stamping out their bollocks due to heavy state intervention in religion . 
  azerbaijan is a prime example , as are most of the central asian countries in which more than 90 % of people identify as muslim . 
  now i 'm not a supporter of communism and i believe it left behind a lot of shit , but you ca n't deny it worked well to suppress domestic radicalism . 
  that 's due to poverty and drugs mixed with a lax work attitude . 
  nothing to do with christianity . 
  mexico city has a lower murder rate than most large us cities . 
  huh i always thought it tasted like figs . 
  maybe the hotel gave me something else but i swear it looked identical . 
  it 's meant to make women more beautiful and fertile lol, 
  ikr im atheist but i certainly partake in nearly all czech traditions that stem from religious holidays . 
  this is one i hope never dies out . 
  too much fun . 
  it 's ok v4 is generally united on this issue . 
  guys , are you ok ? 
  should we send some of our depression-resistant czechs to ma\u010farsko in order to help out ? 
  it 's shameful that a european country ca n't even count the fucking votes properly !, 
  better start sending the greeks our tourists too . 
  they 're not going to want to go to turkey after this . 
  what 's the reason izmir voted so resoundingly no while istanbul and ankara ( both large cities ) voted no by a small margin ? 
  i would 've thought cities in general would vote strongly against this ala brexit & us elections . 
  azerbaijan is part of many european organisations such as the council of europe . 
  it is also included inside the reach of this sub . 
  they 're arguably europe . 
  azerbaijan is a dictatorship too right ? 
  i think we can fit new zealand in place of turkey, 
  we need more land to border our historical friend luxembourg . 
  they 're part of uefa ergo must be europe / s in all honesty , kazakhstan is that country that i never quite know which way it leans . 
  like it 's pretty obvious turkey and the caucasus want to be european , but the kazakhs have always been split it seems . 
  reminds me of dongers, 
  they did that hundreds of years ago though when the french colonised them . 
  what 's turkmen , tajik and kyrgyz like ? 
  cz has no official law against it for use in schools though it 's certainly used anywhere . 
  domestic is still common though . 
  i 'm personally in favour of keeping it . 
  fuck i just realised . 
  none of the other micro states are there either ( except monaco ) . 
  palestine is not going to convince israel they 're capable of peace when they elect a govt that keeps firing missiles at them , as well as airs children 's cartoons that teach people to hate jews . 
   map includes all countries represented on this sub approved and upvoted edit : gib malta , andorra , san marino , lichtenstein and vatican !, 
  palestine needs to adopt a policy of peaceful protest like the anti-apartheid movement in sa and civil rights movement in the us have done . 
  you 're not going to convince your neighbour you 're capable of peace when you keep firing missiles at them , as well as airing children 's cartoons that teach people to hate jews . 
  there 's loads of posters and ads in copenhagen for summer holidays in greece .

  lol , he might be a drunk , but he 's hardly dangerous . 
  i really do n't think that 's just czech thing . 
  i 'm kinda curious as to why we got two states when all the other countries only have one . 
  i 'm sure there 's plenty , i just do n't really think app based dating is an actual thing in slovakia/czech republic edit : then again , i 'm the loneliest guy in central europe , so what do i know, 
   most of reddit is american false [ source ] ( http://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/reddit.com ), 
  right , 'cause tinder is huge in slovakia . 
  nope, 
   spaghetti + ketchup + eidam meh , i still eat the from time to time . 
  nothing wrong with it . 
  dvd ? 
  what year is it ? 
  cheap beer ? 
  so if i decide i need a room at school to do karaoke two times a day during breaks and the school wo n't provide the room for me , is that outrageous too ? 
  is taping matches and watching them later actually a thing outside the us ? 
  you see it on tv shows all the time , but i do n't think i 've actually ever met someone who does this . 
  from the article :  some have criticised `` czechia '' as ugly, 
  so do buses though, 
  where is it not ? 
  [ randomly chosen tram stop near my workplace ] ( http://i.imgur.com/h9sft38.jpg ), 
  i 'd say like half of these pictures are pretty normal, 
   it really drives home the point that you a insignificant and not special i mean , we are insignificant and not special . 
  sooner you come to terms with that , the better i think, 
  why ? 
  it looks alright . 
  lots of green , i hear people are into that . 
  topic of politics is rarely mentioned ? 
  we used to go to a friend 's wine cellar before the afternoon pe class . 
  pe class is really fun after a couple of shots of slivovitz, 
  keep fighting the good fight dude, 
  well , it does n't mean anything similar in czech , so really ca n't see how it could be considered offensive, 
  how is that a same thing ? 
  one of the parts is called '' \u010cesko '', 
  it just sounds wrong and weird . 
  i do n't know why . 
  i 'm hardly alone though , i think most people here hate or at the very least do n't like it . 
  also stupid, 
  yeah , well , maybe it 's not , but it probably is, 
  please do n't , it 's a shitty name and were try not to popularize it, 
  ca n't seem to find one . 
  could probably make one , but i got other stuff to do, 
  i guess , i 've never actually seen it , i just really like the gif, 
  [ ok ] ( https://media.giphy.com/media/y7kvoylzas6ag/giphy.gif ), 
   it 's not really censoring . 
  yeah , that 's exactly what 's baffling me . 
  why do it if it 's so pointless ? 
   f * ck now do n't take my word for it , but i heard you can actually swear on the internet, 
   so you 're saying that all of your politicians are required to be atheist how did you get that out of my comment ? 
  i 'm saying that religious beliefs of our politicians have a zero to one effect on whether they 're gon na be elected or not . 
  oh come on , you guys never had an openly atheist president . 
  they would n't even stand a chance . 
  you can boast about how you did it first or whatever , but that changes nothing about the fact other countries did it much better . 
  about 20 eur, 
  yeah , but compared to a magic goat ... 
  i mean , it 's a no-brainer, 
  tell me about it . 
  we 're stuck with a stupid little baby instead . 
  i do n't understand why you should push a private pub owner to have separate rooms for nonsmokers . 
  just do n't go to the pub in you mind the smoke ? 
  it 's not like you have to go there . 
  as somebody who 's never smoked a cigarette in his life and has actually worked in a restaurant , i think it 's bullshit, 
  was he supposed to talk him down instead and wait till he gets rehabilitated in prison or what ? 
  i suppose , but cost of living in czech republic is way lower, 
  i 'd say it 's pretty impressive when the average is around 30k, 
  we just gon na ignore the spelling ? 
  good luck reforming a guy who murdered 77 kids .

  it 's a nice gesture , but that 's about all it is, 
   well obviously you do n't since you compare second hand smoking with driving . 
  certain jobs come with certain risks . 
  working in an office and sitting in a chair 40 hours a week is n't good for you either . 
  neither is working in a coal mine . 
  yet people still do these jobs . 
   do you not understand that second hand smoking is dangerous and has no benefits ? 
  shit , really ? 
  good to know . 
  no , seriously , how is deciding to work in a smoking pub different than deciding to smoke ? 
  you do n't have to do either , yet people still do . 
  i understand the conversation . 
  do you ? 
  you said the workers do n't have a choice , but they do . 
  i do n't smoke . 
  i never did . 
  i hate the smell . 
  you wan na know how i deal with that ? 
  i do n't go to pubs where smoking is allowed . 
  get a job elsewhere then ?

  it 's not like there 's a job shortage here . 
  hi , nice to meet you . 
  you do see how that 's not the same thing , right ? 
  i hate it , but `` normal '' might be a bit of a stretch, 
  huh , our mayor is a bishop in the hussite church . 
  he 's also an enormous asshole . 
  more lower middle cost , i 'd say , but i agree about the taste,

  the corporations have voting rights there !, 
  [ article and discussion . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3nbk5f/scandinavians_split_over_syrian_influx/ ) and here 's a direct quote from the article :  the norwegian foreign ministry has calculated that because of all the social , health , housing and welfare benefits mandated by the state , supporting a single refugee in norway costs $ 125,000 -- enough to support some 26 syrians in jordan . 
   any proof she went through turkey ? 
  and any proof that greece can handle 800k refugees ? 
  i 'll take a wild guess and assume that a bankrupt country can not . 
  the balance of probability completely dictates she did go through turkey . 
  and yes , many of the mentioned countries had the resources to grant her asylum . 
  she chose not to stop there and thus abused the system . 
   if there is somebody that thinks this girl would not make a wonderful addition to any society , then that person is a shithead . 
  ok , i refuse to discuss with such an arrogant simpleton that you are then . 
  goodbye . 
  yes . 
  norwegian foreign ministry estimated that the money spent taking care of 1 migrant in norway would be able to take care of ** 26 migrants in jordan ** . 
  edit : it was jordan , not turkey , but i imagine it will be similar for turkey .

  since the tax will be a vat , it 'll impact you far more than the richer countries . 
  enjoy the eu touch !, 
  germany is n't a country !, 
  true , but that argument does n't make what i said any less true . 
  you will be left with most of those people that you currently have . 
  even those that really do n't have any right to asylum will remain as illegals . 
  so afghans , iraqis , eritreans that do technically have the right to asylum ? 
  i do n't think so . 
  and iraqi refugees and afghan refugees and eritrean refugees etc. 
  they all have technically the right to asylum . 
  nah , i make fun of the swedish political correctness through hyperbole . 
  migrants are still only roughly 27 % of the country per [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sweden#immigration ) . 
  there was a bit of hyperbole , yes . 
  but i do believe you will end up in a very similar situation the us is now . 
  the state of the us is not dictated by politics , but by human nature . 
  humans are inherently tribal and therefore you can not have high societal cohesion when you have such multicultural society . 
  and without high cohesion people do n't want to pay high taxes for a welfare state ( `` because it 's usually the black/muslim/gypsy people that benefit !, 
  '' ) , white flight happens essentially segregating the societies forming ghettos and even ghetto-cities ( baltimore , potentially malm\u00f6 ) , and so on . 
   i feel sorry for you when you tell me that your moral compass is linked to whatever the law says is right or wrong . 
  it is n't . 
  things that are legal are not necessarily moral and vice versa . 
  when i say the eu i 'm including the member states . 
  there are probably many others too . 
  damn , i wanted to talk to somebody who actually votes in the city of london . 
  the legal system there is bonkers . 
   it has been proven , whit the mare nostrum operation , that even if you sink all the migrants ships that come to europe seeking help , you wo n't stop them . 
  boats are easy to find , that 's not the problem . 
  the problem is you transport those people to the eu when you rescue them . 
  if you did n't do that , but transported them back to libya instead , the number of deaths would drop to 0 within months . 
  people would n't pay thousands of euros to smugglers for a trip on a new boat if they knew that italian navy will tow them back into libya . 
  that depends on whether there is a large corpus of common data ( articles , books , ... ) between the two languages or not . 
  if not , they 'll use an intermediate language . 
  the czech republic ( and switzerland , the netherlands and many others ) is a sovereign country , and every country has the right to make its laws independent of what anyone else wants . 
  ** we absolutely * do * have the right to make stealing other people 's property legal . 
  absolutely agree . 
   misread . 
  can you tell me how refugees like : https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=h-2mjwfwoea[1] are abusing the system ? 
  i believe you are a bit informed what the right to asylum is for . 
  the right to asylum is for people that are honestly fearing for their life in a given country or are seriously oppressed . 
  was she really fearing for her life and/or oppressed in * every * country between syria and germany ? 
  i agree that it is the humane thing to do to resettle this girl into europe , but resettlement is something way beyond asylum and she does n't even technically have the right to asylum , because she would be absolutely safe in turkey , greece , macedonia , serbia , croatia , hungary and austria . 
  if the refugees are honestly fearing for their life , they are to stay in the first safe country . 
  i 'm sorry , but i 'm not a shithead . 
  please do n't call me that . 
  guys , i think he 's talking about the family of sir alexander fleming !,

  unless the politicians are refugees , i would n't bet on it . 
  translators work in real time , so efficiency is not an issue . 
  merkel has much more pressing things to do than to crack open an english textbook . 
  ^ ( like destroying europe ... 
  i kid , i kid :d ), 
  i 'd argue that yes . 
  if eu had good control of external borders and turned around the ships at sea instead of taking the migrants off the boats to the eu , no migrants would be coming on boats , since it 's expensive and they 'd know it 's useless . 
  and if they were n't coming on boats , they would n't be dying on that journey . 
  eu is entirely for blame for the migrant deaths by helping them to illegally cross in the first place . 
  then move to the us . 
  republicans are always on the lookout for voters . 
  i think you might have misread my comment . 
  if you have n't : xenophobia = / = fearing for one 's life . 
  also , syrians are only 20 % of the arriving migrants . 
  it absolutely is . 
  if only people that were honestly fearing for their lives in every country they crossed until they got to eu/germany were coming , there would n't be any xenophobia in europe . 
  but since they 're abusing the system to get better lives , xenophobia is on the rise , and rightfully so . 
  with translators . 
  it 's usually better to use a translator unless the politician is at least a c1 level in the language to avoid any miscommunication . 
  when in cleveland do as clevelanders do !, 
  whatever you do , basil , * do n't mention the war !, 
  migrants have gained control of sweden !, 
   edit : ''  '' indicates it was a joke people , a joke about their political correctness . 
  i 'd say maybe you can work for other muslims ( that are unlikely to report you ) and not fear you 'll be deported ? 
  if they applied for asylum , they 'd be liable for deportation , and unable to work for some time . 
  and if they worked , they would n't get any benefits anyway . 
  wow !, 
  that translation is practically indistinguishable from a human translation !, 
  did he win ? 
  in the czech republic ice hockey is by far the biggest sport in the country . 
  probably because we 're so good at it . 
  i believe that 's incorrect . 
  the laws are made by the legislative branch , in most cases the parliament , which is directly democratically elected .

  well , not necessarily . 
  if those people are thinking of the country at-large it might make sense for them to vote for germany to leave the eu . 
  assuming they believe germany * as a whole * would be better off , they might also rationally assume their own region wo n't be affected . 
  besides , plenty of people move within their country , so it 's not like a guy from dresden would never ever relocate to cologne . 
  however if the only reason is a purely selfish one ( `` our taxes are feeding eastern peasants !, 
  '' ) , then yes , you are correct . 
  the military could easily protect the border as long as it was allowed to use unrestrained force . 
  a billion people would never risk the odds on trying to outsmart european guns . 
  we should redefine our morals to put european residents first , everyone else second . 
  it 's much easier to have kids if you can afford a private bedroom for each kid . 
   by definition it means that every cent contributed from the german areas not receiving similarly high benefits will benefit more from leaving the eu than those areas that are currently receiving funds wait , what ? 
  why is that ? 
  once germany leaves the eu they will be free to redistribute the money they 've saved in whatever way they please . 
  assuming afd is in power when they leave the union , they could pass on savings to their main voters who live in underdeveloped regions . 
   how is it an alternative fact that the areas that currently give the most votes for an anti-eu party are the biggest benefactors of eu funds in germany right now ? 
  it is an alternative fact because it implies they will stop receiving monetary assistance once germany leaves the eu . 
  this is a false equivalence . 
  the us has a lot more immigrants and religion . 
  also a lot more space . 
   we risk being replaced by third world migrants who breed at a much faster rate than us . 
  only if we allow an ` open borders ' approach ... 
  if we deploy the military to protect our borders , this wo n't be an issue . 
  no , give tax breaks to people with children equal to their expenses on taking care of their kids . 
  and then reduce fixed-sum welfare payouts for childbirth/childcare to the bare minimum . 
  this will encourage highly-educated people to give birth ( since they pay a lot of taxes ) and discourage low-income people ( since their tax base is small ) . 
  also , reduce the taxes on condoms/birth control to zero and make abortion 100 % free . 
   coincidentally our afd who is also anti-eu is strongest in those regions germany is a net contributor to the eu , hence they could easily replace those funds if they 've left . 
  i 'm very much pro-eu , but these are ` alternative facts ' . 
  same bullshit piece of trivia keeps circling about regions in the uk receiving eu help . 
  well , yes , romanian protests were a different beasts . 
  but i ca n't see it happening for pro-eu protests : people rarely protest * in favor * of something , usually they prefer to protest * against * . 
  it 's funny how being a ` country ' can change the perspective : - ** city ** of bielefeld ( same population as iceland ) holds a solidarity protest -  nobody cares - ** country ** of iceland holds a solidarity protests -  interesting piece of news, 
  please no . 
  this will pull out all those weird ass ` activists ' , greenpeace members , ` refugees welcome ' posters , etc. 
  it will look like a hippie gathering rather than an assembly of normal people . 
  they probably like wasting money on being ` different ' . 
  same goes for louisiana in the us - worthless waste of taxpayer cash . 
  why does europe give a shit about palestine ? 
  let their arab brothers take care of them . 
  our partner is israel , end of story . 
  trump will back israel 100 % now so europe ca n't do shit ( hopefully ) . 
  especially if parties like afd keep gaining a stronghold and force politicians to respect our trusted middle eastern ally . 
  dual citizens could be a good start : for example there are 1 million turkish citizens in germany , so anyone caught supporting islamism could be deported immediately ( this does n't happen though ) . 
  there are tens of thousands of people in western europe who demand shariah laws to be allowed to exist and denmark saw a great spectacle of international tolerance when a newspaper of theirs dared to publish caricatures of a certain religious figure . 
  fascism or authoritarianism has nothing to do with this , it 's a bullshit accusation . 
   ffs , europe struggled for 2 centuries to get rid of this crap if only their immigration policies were smarter we would n't be here in the first place ... 
  whenever it is shown he/she fully gave up the culture of his/her homeland . 
  like i said , this is already tested heavily in many countries . 
  however in regions which were neglectful about this in the past ( germany , france , belgium ) , it might be necessary to use extreme measures to ensure national security and prosperity . 
  * if * the czech government was negligent in handing out citizenships in the past 50 years , then there could in fact be two categories of citizens . 
  however as far as i 'm aware there is n't much of an issue with recent immigration waves ( 90 % are ukrainians , vietnamese or russians ) . 
   because both are citizens of czech republic and hence equal in the eyes of the state and law . 
  a citizen is just a word . 
  you can change the legal definition at any moment . 
  i am an immigrant to czech republic , so yes , of course . 
  well , no . 
  in an ideal world we would n't have ever granted citizenship to people who are not 100 % integrated and assimilated . 
  however since we 've fucked up in the past , a new tiered system of citizenships would be needed . 
  this is n't the case for countries like czech republic which show extreme diligence in handing out passports , so only western europe would be affected . 
   unconstitutional ( at an european and probaby national level too ) for now it 's illegal , yes . 
  for now . 
   and unfair that is ? 
  it 's unfair that certain people abuse the very state that saved their ancestors from living in a shithole . 
  is n't it unfair that they get to do so without consequences ? 
  only 2nd or 3rd , obviously . 
  we ca n't really deport native europeans anywhere . 
  nope , no dual citizenship in germany . 
  they 're all still turkish nationals . 
  lol , butthurt much ? 
  there 's a million turks in germany who still have turkish passports despite living there for ages ( although it 's by choice ) . 
  you mean the referendum ? 
  did n't that only affect croatia ? 
   so you would remove citizenship from people . 
  interesting only those who commit crimes or permanently live on welfare without a good reason . 
   leave your home that you were born and grew up in , leave your friends and family behind because of backward laws !, 
  well , if your parents lose their jobs and ca n't pay their mortgage , you will also have to move to a cheaper city and forget about your friends . 
  are these laws `` backwards '' as well ? 
  foreigners do n't get to demand anything ( outside of eu 's freedom of movement , of course ) . 
  they can accept the rules or pack their bags , no exceptions . 
  if other countries in europe were just as strict , we could solve today 's immigration-related problems by simply deporting anyone caught abusing the state . 
  sadly , a lot of those folks are citizens so they 're untouchable ( for now ) . 
  switzerland has possibly made a huge mistake , depending on who ends up getting a passport . 
  said children and grandchildren can always move back if they do n't like it ... 
  do italians really need swiss passports though , since switzerland participates in the freedom of movement ? 
  jesus ... what . 
  the . 
  this is absolutely insane . 
  i ca n't imagine a single us scientist ever agreeing to deal with this mess , unless macron literally delivers a permanent residence card in their mailbox . 
  you can say that starting from e.g. 
  2020 all content has to be available everywhere or available nowhere . 
  2-3 years should be enough to deal with the contracts . 
   after you leave ? 
  no more referendums . 
  yeah , i 'd only agree to a 50 +1 referendum if they guarantee a reverse referendum if scotland wins and becomes independent . 
  otherwise it should be 2/3 in favor , with 2/3 attending the vote . 
  less refugees , probably . 
   and therefore must be considered from different viewpoints . 
  well , that 's what should be changed . 
  * all * immigrants should be judged heavily , with no exceptions . 
  our borders are sacred and not a mouse should be able to sneak in without a visa .

  violence , rape and criminal behavior in general in refugee centers . ), 
  in western countries , religion is dying , very few young people are religious . 
  the migration wave is very relevant to the attacks : - current policy means that any isis-er can easily get here . 
  eu has open borders for any terrorist . 
  - more muslims -  higher probability of terrorist attacks in the future . 
  let 's do this reddit . 
   what about finding a job ? 
  making a career ? 
  providing a role model for their kids to follow , so that they study well in school and go on to make a good life for themselves ? 
  is n't that important in terms of assimilation ? 
  yes it is , i did n't list all of the aspects of european culture , just a random sample . 
   where do you think people are supposed to learn of these european values and virtues when they are living in segregated communities ? 
  the main problem is that they do n't want to . 
  they typically want to keep their values and mentality . 
  and try hard to prevent their kids from accepting the mainstream culture and values . 
   by the way , i just want to point that many of those sentiments you pointed out were part of european culture some decades ago . 
  some of them . 
  some of them hundreds of years ago . 
  and a significant portion never . 
  ( i mean aspects of muslim culture in general , not just the examples i mentioned . ), 
  converting to european culture - homosexuality is not a sin , having a girlfriend is ok , letting your daughter wear a skirt is ok , not being antisemitic , etc. 
  i could continue for a while . 
  that 's clearly a conspiracy !, 
  lol , that 's a great gif . 
  no , the shows goes on , germany will welcome 2 million economic refugees next year , merkel is unstoppable . 
  that 's really sad and disheartening . 
  besides the terrorists , i also partly blame the people responsible for eu 's and france 's security policy of `` let anyone in '' . 
  about a month ago i 've seen an interview with an ex-general of our army - he said that the eu is handling the refugee crisis terribly from a security perspective by not having control who gets in , we basically have open borders . 
  could n't agree more , this is unprecedented in recent history and a big failure of the eu . 
  people who have capital or who ca n't be replaced by machines . 
  this argument `` give people money so that they will buy our stuff '' does n't make much sense . 
  overall production will decrease in the antiutopic scenario but real wealth of the rich guys will increase . 
  some examples are competetive debating , programming , mathematics , stand-up ( as in comedy ) etc. 
  what about competetive programming , is that a sport too ? 
  or graphic design competitions ? 
  come back from the dark side orban !, 
  why stop there .

  lol , i love ultra-liberal lingo , you can use it to justify anything . 
  not weird , he 's making fun of and exploiting the liberal justice system . 
   i believe that all of our laws are equal for all of us . 
  no , they 're certainly not , you could find plenty of counterexamples . 
  yes and more people should be . 
   to truly respect juman rights mean respecting even the rights of the worst monster put there . 
  that raises the question whether we should always respect human rights . 
   eastern european countries do n't know what a pluralist society is what is it and why should we want it ? 
  - they are largely unskilled and uneducated . 
  - at least in theory , they are asylum seekers who are expected to return back home . 
  in theory , they did n't come here to work - they are fleeing war in a thirl world country . 
  - you ca n't compare eu migrants and third world migrants , there 's a huge difference . 
  as far as i can remember , in netherlands , polish people have lower unemployment than native dutch . 
  minorities from africa and middle east have the highest unemployment . 
  - if those migrants are really good for the economy , i 'd expect countries to fight for them . 
  instead , they 're bribing turkey , egypt , liberia to keep them out . 
  controlled immigration may help the economy . 
  what 's happening right now most likely wo n't . 
  i hate to say it but i 'm starting to think that this is a necessary evil . 
  be nice to immigrants = they will flood you . 
  or catapult . 
   i am so sorry to all western european bros and especially hungary and slovenia hungary and slovenia can into we !, 
  but seriously , i appreciate it , most croats commenting on / r/europe about this had a pretty weird attutide along the lines of `` lol , haha , we smuggled them to ya country , * middle finger * '' . 
  did n't really understand this . 
  it 's obvious sarcasm . 
  lol , this is so true . 
  thanks , i learn new things every day . 
  will edit my comment above . 
   344 staff to guard the eu sea border ? 
  ok , nevermind , * this * is ridiculous . 
  i could n't resist :d but ok , i 'll stop it , 
  sorry to disappoint you . 
  free taxi . 
  never mind , forget it , it does n't matter . 
  why does n't frontex stop them ? 
  megaphone , warning shots , real shots . 
  edit : as / u/astalano pointed out below , it should be ~ ~ frontex ~ ~ border control . 
  apples and oranges . 
  - you will not get asylum if you get here illegally ( australia-like system ) . 
  - you can apply for asylum at special centers outside of eu borders , for example at refugee camps in turkey or lebanon . 
  - limit the number of asylums per year . 
  let 's be generous and make it twice as big per capita as in the usa . 
  - help them directly at the refugee camps in turkey etc. 
  ( well we finally started to do that , better late then never ) . 
  this is just a salami tactic that must be stopped at the beginning , before it transforms into permanent and ever-increasing quotas . 
  i 'm perfectly ok with 5000 refugees , ** if it 's a one-time thing ** . 
  but i think these quotas are meant as a first step to what merkel probably wants - an automatic redistribution system . 
  100 000 guys magically appear in italy ? 
  here , take 5 % of them . 
  edit : but whether i 'm racist depends on the definition of `` racist '' , it 's a vague word . 
  for example i believe that ashkenazi jews are genetically smarter than aboriginal australians - some people would say it 's racist . 
  well , i was too lazy to write `` it was forced by a majority of eu countries , but they were leadby germany , the loudest and most powerful supporter of quotas '' - but of course you 're free to believe that this is just an excuse and that it was a purposeful lie . 
   germany ca n't force anyone to do anything . 
  ok , i admit i was wrong , it 's a majority of eu countries lead by germany , france and italy , because it 's absolutely in their interest ( they want to redistribute the burden to the rest of the eu ) . 
  germany seems to be the loudest supporter of quotas . 
   but have zero arguments against that do n't make you look like a racist lol , here it comes :d, 
   why can i no texpect every single county to take a share of the refugees according to their population and gdp ? 
  because they do n't want other countries to dictate them how many refugees to accept . 
  why does n't germany force quotas on uk , usa or russia ? 
  because it lacks the power to do that , unlike czech rep etc.

  people here are really wierd . 
   i do n't think europe needs another small country . 
  what does this statement even mean ? 
  did europe need another small country when the netherlands became independant ? 
  what or who decides that ? 
  people should have right of self-detrmination . 
  if majority wants to govern themselves , they should be allowed that . 
  it 's simple as that . 
  i guess ottoman rule evoked the same sentiment in all their subjects . 
   `` raymond sculley then removed a bicycle lock , a heavy metal chain attached to a solid locking end that he took from his own bike , and approached the helpless mr makar . 
   `` he swung the improvised weapon and struck mr makar to the left side of his head , catching him behind the ear and knocking him to the ground where he then struck him at least twice more . '' ...  giving evidence , sculley denied murdering makar , claiming he did not intend to kill him and was acting in self-defence . 
  what the fuck ? 
  at least there 's no risk of our country turning into giant lake . 
  probably living their life in peace without fear of lynching . 
  you can take our freedom , but you wo n't take our gott !,

  yes !,

  stupid me . 
  slivovice though . 
  i admit we ca n't beat them there . 
  who the hell is coming up with this stuff . 
  we should push for czech to be used instead of english in brussels after brexit . 
  because there is so little left . 
  it does n't help that some of sources are basically forgeries from 19th century . 
  plus , slavic mythology/history is still pretty political in some countries . 
  would it though ? 
  part of the reason europe advenced so quickly compared to the rest of the world was lack of resources that promted explortion and constant conflict between relatively equal realms . 
  if there were still pax romana , maybe there would n't be enough incentive to develop new technologies . 
  europe could have very well ended like china .

  first stabbing of oranges , hacking airlines ' website , then stealing a flag of dutch consulate and now this ? 
  are these attempts to make us take him serious ? 
  you are not . 
  it 's pretty obvious . 
  i am pretty sure erdo already had a fiery statement about french refusal of plane 's landing and this took him by surprise . 
  and they originated in austria . 
  mostly mountains and gorgeous nature .

  at the same time , i also realize that the us contribution to our security was not purely altruistic and that it served american interests as well . 
  still , even if it was n't altruistic , it still was very benefitial for us , so i highly appreciate that . 
  i see that currently the us is no longer willing to fullfil this role . 
  obviously it does n't make me extremely happy , but i think this would all be managable for europe , if the overall withdrawal of american presence in europe was slow and gradual , if we had more time to prepare for it and if we could still count on the political partnership with the us . 
  but if trump sides with putin on his quest to tear apart the eu , then we have a serious issue . 
  in either case , i think we need a closer defense cooperation within the eu outside of nato , because i feel like with trump as the president , we simply can not rely on nato anymore . 
   uk will probably have a lot of influence with trump . 
  we can use that influence to ensure usa remains committed to nato . 
  what makes you think that you 're gon na have a lot of influence with trump ? 
  you 're the weaker partner in the us-uk relationship . 
  if anything , he 'll be pressuring you to give him more favourable conditions in the us-uk free trade deal in order for him to support you in your negotiations with the eu . 
  to be honest i think we 're past the point of asking whether we can keep the us commited to nato or not . 
  us under trump are gon na be an unreliable partner , no matter what we or you do . 
  they 're gon na be like this at least for the next 4 years . 
  his remarks about the eu and germany are openly hostile . 
  either he 's an idiot or he 's deliberately trying to divide us . 
  this is not his bombastic campaign anymore where we could ignore what he says thinking that he 's talking purely for his domestic audience . 
  not only is he not really changing his rhetorics , he 's hardening it towards the eu . 
  we in the eu need our own security arrangements and we need them fast , we ca n't rely on nato anymore . 
   we would love to be a good friend to you , if you let us . 
  maybe you personally would like to , but the british politicians ? 
  part of the tories hate the eu . 
  current labour under corbyn hates nato and the west in general . 
  ukip thinks the eu is the source of all the evil in the world . 
  a big part of your public and media hate the eu . 
  when i 'm nowadays looking at the current uk , i 'm not sure whether this country wants to be a good neighbour to us . 
  it seems like you prefer to be good friends with trump . 
  i know that may might be saying nice things now , but these nice things might go out of the window very quickly if the negotiations do n't go very smoothly . 
   i think we can do a great deal together . 
  no offence , but that sounds like something trump would say  but jokes asides , i hope you 're right . 
  i really hope we could keep it civil between us , but i 'm genuinely worried we wo n't be able to . 
  i feel like the atmosphere is getting more and more toxic everywhere . 
  putin 's long term geopolitical goal is to break the eu apart and separate us from the both the uk and the us . 
  he already helped doing that with the us . 
  now we have a potus who either does n't really understand the value of the eu , or worse he 's straight-out hostile to it . 
  in the uk there are also many people who basically see the eu as an evil organization . 
  leaving for them is not enough , they also want to destroy it . 
  then you have a big group of people who might not be hostile to the eu , but they 're also completely indifferent - they do n't see the benefits of the eu , they do n't understand how valuable it can be for the uk to have a strong and stable eu , instead of several relatively strong and many relatively weak nations bickering among each other and russia exploiting the situation . 
  because if things go to hell in europe , it will negatively affect the uk as well . 
  perhaps i 'm being too negative , but this situation is really worrying to me . 
  the eu is not immortal . 
  before 1989 nobody thought that the soviet union might collapse this quickly . 
  and then it happened . 
  the pressure on the eu nowadays is huge . 
  brexit , trump , putin , the mess in the middle east/africa , hungary and poland backsliding in democratic standards , the eurozone problems ... the eu is dealing with a lot and i 'm beginning to doubt if it can survive it . 
  i only know that there 's no reasonable substitution for it . 
  if it dies , then we have nothing , no institutional background that would prevent us from going back to pre-ww2 norms . 
  and this is all terrifying to me . 
  nobody said that we would n't trade with you . 
  we will continue trading with you , just under different conditions that will be less favourable than if you were in the single market . 
  but that 's absolutely obvious , if you leave the single market , you ca n't possibly demand the same conditions . 
  of course i do n't know what the exact conditions will look like , but i think it 's absolutely clear that no one in europe wants a complete trade embargo with the uk . 
   not wanting a good trade agreement with the uk puts the uk in jeopardy though . 
  no , it does n't , at the very best , it puts the uk in the risk of having an economic recession/stagnation , but it does n't pose any existential threat to the uk . 
  it 's completely uncomparable to the risk that baltics and other ee countries would be facing if the european security were to unravel . 
   also , trade and security are fundamentally linked in international relations and always have been . 
  this is true , it was always like that , however in the post ww2 era , a new security climate was established in europe . 
  realpolitik obviously still plays a big role , but among the `` european family '' it 's no longer acceptable to use brute force as a foreign policy tool . 
  nor is it acceptable to use direct or indirect threats of using force . 
  for example , we do not threaten to throw someone under the bus anymore if we do n't get our way . 
  countries are not some autonomous entities , they are led by people and people are shaped by the society and the european societies made huge steps after ww2 . 
  things that used to be normal are no longer socially acceptable . 
  that 's why it would be such a huge shame to lose this all and that 's why i 'm really worried what trump and putin might do to the eu . 
  i really hoped that the uk even after leaving the eu would still abide by the new foreign policy standards , that it would not go completely back to realpolitik in your relations with the eu member states , but if that 's not the case , then you 're not part of the family anymore and you ca n't be surprised if the eu also starts to treat you purely in the realpolitik way . 
   trump being crazy will make the eu want better relations with the uk and also want the uk to have better relations with the eu . 
  i would hope so , but unfortunately i do n't really believe it . 
  i think it 's quite likely that the uk will try to abuse this whole situation where we 'll be weakened by hostile russia and if not openly hostile , then definitely very unsupportive us , to get more concessions during the negotiations . 
   if you do n't want free trade with us , do you really want us to be part of european security ? 
  well , you see the problem is that you 're connecting two issues that i think should not be connected . 
  there 's the question of what kind of trade agreement we 'll have after brexit and i think we can all agree that we want some agreement , we just need to figure out the specific arrangements . 
  and then there 's the question of the overall european security and i do n't think this should be thrown around in the negotiations as a bargaining chip , since it puts some of the eu member states in jeopardy , mostly the baltic countries . 
  and if you want to put eu member countries in jeopardy just so that you can achieve more favourable trade arrangements , then i 'm not really sure we can be friends . 
  i 'm afraid that if trump continues being hostile to the eu , threatening trade wars with germany , even implying that he would like to see more countries leaving , we 're all gon na be forced to act more confrontationaly and this will affect our relation with the uk as well :( specially if you side with trump and will try to use nato as a leverage in the negotiations and so on . 
  i do n't really know what to expect from that man , but i 'm afraid this can all turn ugly very quickly . 
  i 'm not sure if our government has any consistent strategy . 
  i mean , sure , they talk about investment into education , research , innovation , infrastructure and so on , but the reality is not as rosy . 
  at the same time , i realize that these things are simply difficult to achieve in our current conditions . 
  you 're right that a big amount of companies are foreign-owned . 
  these companies brought investment , but they 're also taking away massive amounts of money in the form of dividents out of the country . 
  way more than we get through the eu funds . 
  some of this money is then spent in the western europe on their research and development , while we 're stuck with being in the middle of the supply chain . 
  it 's really a vicious circle to try to catch up with the western europe , since they simply have a head start in pretty much everything - i mean - the more money you have , the more money you can spend on r&d which produces even more money . 
  it 's hard to break this cycle , since being in the eu also does n't allow us to start with any protectionst measures that would help protecting our not as developed sectors until they 're competitive enough . 
  what i think we should be doing is focusing on the few high-skilled/high-added value sectors that we 're already good at - for example we 're fairly good at it security - czech owned companies , like avast and avg ( who recently merged into one ) might not be the biggest players at the scene , but they 're fairly succesful , plus cyber security has obviously a huge future potentional - it would be great if we could copy the israeli model in this regard ( where the defense industry to a big extent shapes the research and development ) , since the cyber threats are and will be pretty significant anyway , so defense against that will be needed . 
  plus obviously we should take steps to diversify our economy and decrease our dependency on manufacturing/industry and move a bit more towards the service economy . 
  it seems like the current government is trying to make us more attractive for the shared-economy companies ( like uber or airbnb ) . 
  also there are some efforts to support the start up scenes , but imho these efforts are not yet coordinated enough . 
  the overall r&d spending is balancing at 2 % of gdp , which is more than it 's usual in cee , but less than in we . 
  in some fields , it 's simply unrealistical for us to expect to grow our own succesful czech-owned corporations . 
  so we should at least try to get some of the r&d centres of foreign-owned companies , not just manufacture centres . 
  for that , we need to be attractive for them , so obviously we need business-friendly enviroment and well-educated work force . 
  for that we have to make ourselves attractive for highly-skilled educated people . 
  as for now , more people are moving here than moving out , there 's already 500k foreigners , which is 5 % of our population ( and those are only foreigners who live here legally ) , but under the current economic conditions , it 's simply still not enough people . 
  foreign investors still like it here , because in terms of quality of the work force , they get the same quality as in we but at a cheaper price , but it 's gon na be increasingly more difficult to lure r&d centres here , if they 're not sure whether they can find enough skilled people here . 
  you know , despite all the huge flaws of our political scene , i 'm quite sure that there are also some smart people in the government offices who know all this as well , but the question is whether they 'll manage to implement it - and honestly i just do n't know , we 'll have to wait and see . 
  plus we 're a small country with an open economy - so many things are simply not in our hands . 
   there is the middle income trap and romania will not escape it . 
  maybe the czech rep will but their economic fundamental and geographical position is vastly different . 
  we 're hitting the middle income trap and trying to get away from it right now . 
  you have not yet reached the maximum potentional of your current economic model , while we 're almost at it - we basically have full employment , big trade surpluses , salaries are rising due to the lack of labour force , state budget is more or less stable ... but the thing is that labour productivity is not rising enough - in other words , we 're mostly still stucked with low or middle added-value products .

  not really , most syrians will just get up and go back to their families in syria , turkey etc. 
  and the 80 % that are not syrians will just go back to their countries . 
  and no , people coming to europe wo n't be relatively few . 
  not by any sense of the word . 
  it 'll be millions upon millions accelerating every year . 
  well , i feel like this is an issue all swedes can agree on . 
  it hits points for both sides : 1 . 
  migrants should be allowed to do whatever the fuck they want . 
  fuck the law . -- delusional swedes 2 . 
  migrants should be allowed to get the fuck out of sweden . -- long term thinking swedes notice that the number of counter-demonstrations -- 30 -- is quite large , instead of having one large counter-demonstration . 
  the delusionals do n't want to demonstrate along side the `` racists '' . 
  but they all want to demonstrate . 
  he was being sarcastic . 
  get your detector upgraded . 
  why does every person that is even an inch more anti-immigration than you have to be an extremist nazi that wants to kill them all ?!?!?!, 
  do you realize that such emotional outbursts are pretty much destroying any hope of sensible debate on this topic ??? 
  anyway , the only incentive that is needed is if merkel declares that refugees will be only housed and fed . 
  they will not receive any monthly allowances , they will not be allowed to work and they will not be granted citizenship . 
  they will be returned when the conflict ends . 
  all that is perfectly legal according to all refugee treaties that have been signed . 
  now we can agree that this wo n't be very nice to the few that are currently in germany and the eu , but it * will * stop the hundreds of millions from coming . 
  it 's better that few do n't get all the luxuries than hundreds of millions suffer . 
   it is n't going to to anyone any good if we are going to keep refugees locked up in centers . 
  it will cost money . 
  even worse it will create a sub culture of poor unemployed people whose brightest prospect is being sent back to syria one day . 
  do you know what an incentive is ? 
  `` a thing that motivates or encourages someone to do something . '', 
  if the tens , possibly hundreds , of millions of current potential refugees in the world hear that the eu is resettling all refugees that come their way , everybody will want to make the trip . 
  and the number of potential refugees will grow as new wars start up in different places , as famines spread , as global warming creates new power struggles . 
  it is simply not possible for the eu to resettle all these people . 
  so we must be extremely careful not to incentivise them to come !, 
   are you sure that turkey is willing to integrate them into their society ? 
  contrary to what many people think , refugees do n't have a right to integrate . 
  refugees have right to claim asylum -- to reside in a neighboring country until the crisis in their home country is resolved . 
  resettlement/integration is * not * part of the deal . 
  eu countries do chose to voluntarily resettle those who end up on its territory , but it is in no way required , or indeed realistic with the current migrant wave . 
  the answer is objective . 
  well , that however only works on microsoft windows . 
  official ones that guarantee accuracy ? 
  or do you mean libre/open office , etc. 
  come on , a bit of creativity !, 
  besides , all the - stan countries are in central asia , not in the middle east !, 
  how about croaq ? 
  just declare croatia to be a part of the middle east from now on ... 
  so the english can have some decent food ? 
  then i guess the 12 % number is n't as universal as you think . 
  the euro-asian border has never been completely agreed upon anyhow . 
  come on , being pessimistic gets you nowhere . 
  believe in yourself !, 
  also , who in their right mind would want to speak * german * ?!, 
  around merkel , hopefully . 
  except croat-serbian border fence alone solves nothing , they 'll just go through bosnia . 
  also , hungary ca n't build a fence on the croat-serbian border ... that 's kinda not how that works .

  as do europeans . 
  in goat-fucking we stand united . 
  so , it 's confirmed , just 21 % are syrians . 
  goes to show this crisis is going to be permanent until all the fences are up . 
  nice map . 
  but the person that chose the color scheme was clearly retarded . 
  neighbouring countries should have noticeably different colors , not as similar as possible !, 
  absolutely . 
  and not only for the government , but for the citizens as well , who wo n't have to buy expensive microsoft windows and office just to open government documents !, 
  7 hand grenade attacks in a row just in the city of malm\u00f6 if i recall correctly . 
  wow , volkswagen , that 's pretty fucking disgusting . 
  you should be * ashamed * and fined billions of dollars . 
  i believe the czech government would contemplate and likely do the same thing . 
  if the germans want to see the eu burn , i say let them . 
  me too , it could n't possibly be any funnier than this . 
  was it always this bad ( relatively to other parts of the balkans ) , or did the region suffer from its independence ? 
  all eastern european countries would jump at the opportunity to provide you with their police , their armies their fence-building materials . 
  we want to help as much as we possibly can . 
  we just wo n't be forced to accept permanent migrants , that 's all . 
  of course closing external borders will work . 
  a good fence will stop a horde of people without a problem . 
  and yes , this is going to be permanent , that 's why we need to build those fences !, 
   `` ** it can not be that one country in europe takes on the injustice of a whole world ** , '' ** merkel said ** friday in the eastern german city of halle . 
  ** we do not want to take on the injustice of the whole world . 
  do it if you want , but leave us the * fuck * alone !, 
  there 's plenty of time . 
  the problem will only keep accelerating until the fences are up . 
  so they 'll have to do it sooner or later . 
  it 's really cool !, 
  well , they do n't have to fence the entire border , just the parts migrants might actually go through . 
  and if migrants decide to scale the 2k mountains to get through , they can finish it there too . 
  it wo n't be a huge financial burden , and all eastern european countries will chip in if they ask . 
  i think that 's it , the regions in latvia are by far smaller than almost all countries . 
  couple that with very low population of latvia , and i bet you those blue parts just do n't have abortion clinics . 
  as i say , if it 's just temporary accommodation the entire eastern bloc will agree in a heartbeat . 
  we feel your pain and we 'd like to help you as much as we can . 
  but forced permanent immigration into our countries is just a line we resolutely refuse to cross . 
  and i do n't think anyone serious would call germany nazi if you started dealing realistically with the problem . 
  the stigma of being `` nazis '' is -- i feel -- mainly only * inside * germany . 
  not that much outside of it anymore .

  ok , thanks for the info . 
   seldom over 40 \u00b0 c but easily over 30 \u00b0 c , i guess , so not very pleasant, 
   you can almost swim in the air . 
  yeah sounds very pleasant . 
  well , that makes sense . 
  do n't you have less humid air on average in those areas with extreme temperatures compared to european climate ? 
  or am i talking rubbish here ? 
  _ what they have done ?

  edit : also hacky sacks , diabolos , but were the waves early enough or at least independent of the internet , i do n't know . 
  as an aside , why are there two pick up blobs ? 
  protip : a white font can be used on black if that black is necessary . 
  you can build on that and come with some counter argument towards the ban of incandescent light bulb . 
  yeah they are terribly inefficient in a light creation , but who says the heat comes to naught . 
  i mean not always , it 's not perfect , etc. , but the light bulbs are mostly inside and they are used more in winter when you also need a heat . 
  of course , some of the heat escapes directly from the light bulb through the window as infrared radiation , etc , etc. 
  but my point is that it 's not that grim with its inefficiency . 
  moreover , there are also other arguments like that the production of incandescent light bulbs is simple and not so damaging to the environment , so yeah . 
  of course , i 've never calculated how great the outcome of the ban was/is and i 'm also not disputing it , i 've just never heard of the first argument as i described here , that 's just my 2 $ cents . 
  well yes , the temperature difference between the desired temperature and the outside one is smaller in case of ac cooling . 
  nonetheless if it was the other way than the heating would be better , since the heat is the desired product you can be approaching to the limit of 100 % efficiency more easily . 
   for all we know the husband inherited from his parents through sharia law and got more than his sisters , if his estate was handled according to sharia the inequality would be righted as his sisters would now get part of his estate . 
  instead by changing to the greek system his sisters might be getting the short end of the stick . 
  yeah this sound like an unfortunate scenario for those sisters , but that certainly should only mean that those who are applying/using this parallel sharia law have to take into account these scenarios and adapt to it and not the other way around .

  we [ had got ] ( http://www.ceskatelevize.cz/porady/10441294653-hyde-park-civilizace/9271-english/28103-cedric-villani-mathematician-fields-medal-2010-laureate/ ) him on the public tv recently .

  so i must admit that i totally tend to go with the `` well , they do n't want to come to my country , so fuck it , it 's not our problem '' thinking , even though i realize that from a rational point of view , this is a very bad approach . 
  as i said though , i 'm already pretty numb about this whole crisis . 
  i just do n't care anymore . 
  i normally do n't think of problems in this way . 
  we have a lot of issues in my country and i normally enjoy talking about possible solutions and even taking action when it 's possible . 
  i would say i 'm pretty civically active person ( not sure if i 'm using the right expression in english ) . 
  but , gosh , this migrant crisis is such a clusterfuck , that it 's just easier for my to bury my head in the sand . 
   not sure whether they are applied right or large enough in scale . 
  i would say probably not , given how southern europe has been receiving them for decades and has n't really caught up at all . 
  there are definitely major issues with the eu funds , both within the receiving countries ( corruption and also the general incompetence or even inability to reach to funds in the first place ) and within the eu ( the bureaucracy is horribly complicated and often scares off people and companies that could use the money well ) . 
  before these issues are at least reduced , it would make no sense to just pump more money into it . 
  and even if the issues were reduced , the mental division between the west and the east is now stronger because of the migrant crisis , so when the next budget is designed , i expect western european countries to insist that not so much money goes to the cohesion anymore ( plus the uk is leaving , so that 's another net contributor no longer giving money to the budget ) . 
  i do n't really mind though , we really need to prepare ourselves to develop our countries purely by our own means , that 's just the reality that 's gon na hit us sooner or later no matter if that 's fair or not . 
  whining about how the system of economic integration in the eu means that we should be compensated the same way a state compensates for its poorer regions is not gon na get us anywhere . 
  it 's pretty clear that germany is not willing to do this further economic integration ( not even collapsing greece pushed them for it ) , so we need to accept that and manage on our own . 
  well , isnt ' t that what the cohesion funds are suppose to be for ? 
  to compensate for the fact that some areas are economicaly more developed than others ? 
  not that they necessarily work perfectly , but as far as i 'm concerned , that is the main idea behind them . 
   i find the way russia contorts reasoning to remove the opinions of the former warsaw pact nations out of the equation ridiculous . 
  yes , that 's obviously one point , but even if the west ignored our wishes and decided the put russia first ( which it kinda did at the beginning , only re-evaluating this position after the attempted coup against gorbatchev and after russia tried to forcibly end the protests in the baltics ) , i 'm still quite convinced that it would have not worked out with russia . 
  i mean , i often say we were in a fucked up position in the 90s , but compared to russia , we were doing relatively well . 
   the problems here are more politically than economically : the odds are great that it will take way too long to catch up economically because there was lack of certain important economical advantages in the long term , so you ca n't really count that it . 
  but politically it iss important to first allow eeu nations to catch up : reduce corruption , solidify the rule of law and democratic traditions . 
  instead some countries have been hijacked by illiberal leaders undermining many aspects of it . 
  i agree with all this , obviously we still have a lot of catching up to do , both economically and politically . 
  the point i was trying to make was that if we were denied the chances to join the eu , then our chances to catch up with the western europe would be zero . 
  it would be completely hopeless . 
  with the eu membership , we at least got closer , caught up economicaly with the poorer southern european countries and we at least have the chance to catch up with other we countries in the future . 
  definitely not germany , benelex or scandinavia , but spain and italy are doable . 
   but man do some people find ways to spin even that in a negative way . 
  jeez . 
  exactly . 
  what i can at least understand ( even though i do n't agree with it ) is when people say that they should n't have integrated ee countries into the western institutions , because it antagonized russia and destroyed the chances to fully overcome the cold war . 
  but i seriously ca n't believe that someone thinks they should not have admitted ee in the eu , because it would have been better to first wait for us to reach western european standards . 
  that 's just so stupid and shows complete lack of understaing of the situation . 
  we would never ever reach the western european standards in anything if we did n't have the prospects of joing the eu ahead of us . 
   however , you would n't have been running off to russia . 
  that seems unlikely . 
  no , russia would be running to us . 
  not literaly obviously , just doing their best to destabilize the region and with the eu saying `` see you maybe in the next few decades '' it would n't even be difficult . 
  honestly the fact that someone in the west even thinks this would be a good idea is really sad . 
  if the west can be proud of something then it 's how it managed to handle the post-89 situation . 
  yes , i 'm serious . 
  do you have any idea in what kind of state we were after the collapse of the communist regimes ? 
  fucked up economies , corruption everywhere , wild privatization , weak state institutions ( such as police , courts , prosecutors ) . 
  it was the desire to join the western organizations that got the politicians to actually work on this ( not just on their personal gain ) , because they knew people would get pissed at them if they fucked it up . 
  if there was no possibility to join the eu any time soon , our economies would suffer , our politicians would be too busy stealing public money rather than working on improving the countries , the people would obviously get frustrated , russian influence would destabilize us even further and i can assure you that the level of tolerance towards minorities would be the last worry of everyone . 
   ` if you do n't hold on to us tight we 'll run off to russia ' nope , the other way around . 
  russia would try to get us back if they could . 
  not militarily , if we were in nato in this hypothetical scenario , but they would try to destabilize us economicaly and politicaly to make any sort of future eu integration impossible . 
   and really , only a few decades is what you need jeez , only a few decades ? 
  seriously ? 
  this really shows that you have no knowledge about this region and about the transformation process in the 90s and early 00s . 
  it would have never been as succesfull if it were n't for the carrot ( i.e. 
  eu membership ) that eu used to encourage our politicians to reform . 
  if the message was `` yeah , well , maybe , in a few decades you can get in , but now fuck off '' , the motivation to do really well on the human rights issues would be non-existent . 
  i do n't think you realize how incredibly difficult it is to transform a country , but if you look elsewhere in the world , you can see that it rarely works out and sometimes it can go horribly wrong . 
  the fact that the west managed to support us and did n't allow this region to go the yugoslav way , did n't allow russia to destabilize it and did n't let the pro-democratic changes to fade away is not a geopolitical mistake , it is actually a great success . 
  you can only look at turkey , or mena region in general to see how it works out when the eu is unable to apply the carrot and stick method on its immediate neighbours . 
  that 's kind of ironic that this statement about us being socially light years behind comes from someone from a country which just voted to leave the eu largely because of immigration ( only in the uk 's case , you probably dislike the eastern europeans more than muslims ) . 
  but anyway , i can assure you that not admitting us to the eu would be even a bigger geo-political mistake . 
  it 's not that much fun to have your immediate neighbours trapped in a weird sort of power vacuum with no concrete prospects , not belonging either to the western world , nor to the eastern bloc anymore . 
  sooner or later , russia would try to get advantage of this and the entire region would be instable , volatile and vulnerable and you would have to deal with more serious problems than `` eastern europeans have not yet reached our levels of tolerance '' . 
  is portugal not really hot during the summer ? 
  i always just assumed it 's hot there in july and august ( like +35 \u2103 ) . 
   currently no one without a schengen visa can enter norway via russia , as the border is sealed off to anyone without a valid visa . 
  i know i 'm nitpicking , but russians can actually get tourist schengen visa and then apply for asylum once they 're in the eu . 
  it happens here and there in the cz , not in large numbers , but we do have some russians applying for asylum here because of political reasons . 
  the point is , i know it can be tempting to just dismiss an entire group of people who came from a seemingly safe country , but it might not always be the best solution . 
  that 's the best kind of rich nowadays . 
  you can lead comfortable lifes while at the same time , no migrants or refugees want to stay in your country , 
   the numbers will fall even more as a new law kicks in which allows us to deny anyone asylum if they transit through a safe country . 
  can you unilateraly do that if you signed the geneva convention and also abide by the european human rights court ? 
  ( or you do n't abide by that ? ), 
  it would sure solve a lot of troubles if we could say that anyone coming from turkey could be denied asylum right away , but this is not really possible under international law , as far as i 'm concerned . 
  also it 's kinda problematic since while i agree that most of the people who leave turkey are doing so purely out of economic reasons , some might be genuinely persecuted in turkey though , for example because of their sexual orientation or so . 
  in your case , what if there was a person from russia persecuted by putin 's regime for political reasons ( which is totally plausible in the case of russia ) , would this law mean that you would just reject his application , since russia is seen as a safe country ? 
  you have a higher gdp ( nominal ) per capita than us . 
  so does estonia . 
  we have a higher gdp ppp per capita than you two though . 
   the year that i live in prague , it started snowing in october , and did n't stop until april . 
  six months . 
  i do n't know of any parts of the us ( aside from alaska ) which have climates like that . 
  seriously , are you sure you 're not exaggerating ? 
  i think i would have remembered that winter . 
  it never snows here non-stop every single day for six months . 
  but anyway , global warming is kicking in and the winters are getting milder and milder . 
  these days , we have like 4 weeks of snow in total outside of the mountains during the winter . 
  to be honest , i do n't like that , i really love snowy weather , it 's the best kind of winter . 
  ca n't see why people complain about that . 
   at that time , skinhead violence ( that the police just did n't give a shit about ) on exchange students was a thing . 
  wow , this is really difficult to hear , i 'm sorry . 
  i do n't even know what to say , only that i think the attitudes towards people of different colours are getting better , specially prague is nowadays quite cosmopolitan . 
   i 'm sure that in the end , some sort of proportionality-based allocation will prevail here . 
  well in the end , there will be no functioning allocation system at all , precisely for the reason that neither the refugees nor the host countries are willing to respect it/implement it . 
   ridiculously cold winters . 
  whaat ? 
  we do n't have ridiculously cold winters . 
  we have normally cold winters . 
  you know who has really cold winters ?

  but i would be scared anyway , i know it 's irrational . 
  never in cash . 
  would be too scared someone would rob me . 
  i 'd simply wire transfer it . 
  would probably need financing anyway . 
  we use interest rates to control the money supply in the economy . 
  after the financial and sovereign debt crises , the interest rates hit zero lower bound ( 0 % ) . 
  but we still need to increase the money supply when there is a danger of deflation . 
  so we go beyond 0 % and set -1 % . 
  i wish it was that easy . 
  if someone else 's wish is something that is in contradiction with someone else 's wish , we obviously can not let them both pursue it . 
  we need those -1 % rate to run the economy . 
  what do you mean is coming ? 
  i do n't really think it would be much of a problem to abolish cash . 
  it 's not about myself . 
  we could have a 10000 eur note , but it would be useful only for a very small percentage of people + the criminals . 
  you could say that just because of criminals we should n't punish even that small percentage that uses it . 
  but the thing is that the disadvantages outweigh the advantages , so it makes sense not to have a 10000 eur note . 
  you can never satisfy everyone , you just have to satisfy the majority . 
  roads are good for us ordinary folk . 
  $ 500 notes are useless . 
  that political compass is not a good representation of a government politics . 
  politics is not two-dimensional . 
  i do n't think you can make any assumptions about the divides between the rich and the poor from the compass . 
   it 's not as bad there , though considerable divides between the rich and poor remain czech republic has one of the lowest inequalities in the world . 
  but bear sterns was eventually bought by jp morgan . 
  no one is going to let db fail , it 's too big to fail , 
  there are 28 governments in the eu . 
  it would be really crazy if every government wanted something changed in the agreement . 
  you vote on it ( or lobby policymakers ) when it is finished . 
  nothing undemocratic about that . 
  you ca n't possibly negotiate when everyone ( companies , unions , people , governments ) keeps criticising something in it . 
  if the deal is bad , we will just not have it accepted , those in charge of negotiations are aware of that . 
  yes , but only to avoid high taxes , i think . 
  do n't really think that is a big problem . 
  this is complete bs . 
  do you at least have some reputable sources for your statements ? 
   so , i 'll ask again , is there not a push by western corporations ( who obviously control eu and western politicians ) interested in keeping wages down in the east ? 
  how would they do that in a market-based economy ? 
  if there is a lot of fdi in a country , there is a lot of demand for workers . 
  if there is a low supply of workers , wages naturally must rise , how could they not ? 
   the czech republic is the first eastern country to plateau on the possible growth brought on by western investment and membership in the eu . 
  source ? 
  how did you manage to come up with that ? 
   as the growth of wages stops and the eu ( and the west ) is unwilling to create a mechanism to reduce income inequality more rapidly , the czech republic is going to be the first country to contemplate leaving the free-trade zone and imposing import taxes how would that help anything ? 
   there is no way that the people accept stagnating wages at 750 - 900 - 1000 euros when people next door are making more than double ; yes , there is . 
  it is called cost of living . 
   they 're going to push their political class to raise wages which will mean entering into a conflict with the west ( corporations and the politicians they control ) no comment . 
  i think we will be above 4 % when the official figure gets out ( around 14th of february ) , in q3 we had 4.7 % . 
  yeah , both . 
  it 's best to provide a source ( with a direct link ) because : * it 's in the rules . 
  your post could get removed if you do n't provide a source . 
  * some people ( like me ) might want to check other countries , 
  source ? 
  i do n't think i do , unfortunately . 
  i think the american services are better , but besides that i am also quite a specific customer . 
  i want to watch movies in original and read books in english . 
  so , there are some czech services like netflix , but they all suffer one or all of these drawbacks : * no hd * czech subtitles that you can not disable * no android/ios app as for books , the selection of english books is nowhere near as good as on amazon . 
  there are some czech music services , but again , not as good as spotify or google music . 
  yeah , exactly . 
  i pay for google music , buy books on amazon , games on steam and now i can watch unlimited amount of movies whenever i choose . 
  these services are fucking worth it , we need to support them . 
  yeah , but that is illegal . 
  yeah , maybe . 
  hopefully , there will be a lot of interest in my country which will convince them to add a lot more content . 
  currently , the interface is n't even translated and there are no czech subtitles , so there probably wo n't be much interest initially :(, 
  i pay 9.99 $ to get hd , and it really is hd , very good quality . 
  if i am satisfied after the trial month , i 'll keep the subscription . 
  the only problem i currently see is that the selection is quite poor , but they might add a lot of movies/tv shows soon . 
  yeah , but we have debit cards . 
  they are used the same way as credit cards when paying over the internet . 
  czech republic also 55.6 . 
  yay !, 
  1 year, 
   make up at least 20 percent of ** all registered voters ** is n't a registered voter someone who can vote ? 
  not someone who voted , but someone who is legally able to vote . 
  still better than to put a piece in its place that does n't fit . 
  why ? 
  about goddamn time . 
  can confirm . 
  live in brno , 4500 kc rent ( including utilities and internet , share flat with 2 other people though ) , cheap stuff , at the end of a month i still have about 20k left of my salary . 
  pretty good deal if you ask me , 
  well , i do n't know , i have a theory , but it 's likely wrong . 
  i think it 's because the czech republic lacks the piece of history where human rights , equality , racial issues etc. 
  were discussed and were becoming important , i.e. 
  the second half of 20th century . 
  west had experienced this phase , but we had n't because we were behind iron curtain . 
  so now we are a few decades behind as far as human mentality is concerned . 
  yeah , agreed , so disappointed in my country right now . 
  probably copy & pasted it from somewhere . 
  no chance they can speak all those languages . 
  as soon as ireland and malta get on that chart , we will be third and you will be fourth , 
  still could get worse . 
  vw fuck-up is going to affect q4 . 
  on the other hand chinese investments could somewhat offset decrease in demand of skodas . 
  we will see , but if we stay above 4.0 % in q4 , i wo n't be disappointed . 
  ah , sorry , i just wanted to make it clear that i have a different opinion but i can see i have overblown it and now it has a different meaning ... well , i have removed the emphasis . 
  it 's not ( in my opinion ) . 
  people should asses single ideas regardless of where it 's coming from . 
  it 's due to politics .

  people who made syria what it is and who would be happy to make europe into syria 2.0 , just on larger scale . 
  once they are numerous enough , we will have it on our streets , too . 
  you obviously do not believe in the possibility of such development , say , in your own country , do you ? 
  i do not like the current bloated monster that calls itself `` human rights '' , no . 
  we are coddling our mortal enemies and , once they are numerous enough to start a full-scale war on us , we might actually be defeated and exterminated by them . 
  there wo n't even be a tombstone to write `` suicide by human rights '' onto . 
  jihadis are enemies of mankind and should not be left to breathe . 
  a counterargument : to steer a parliament vote in your direction , you need to bribe/influence/blackmail / manipulate several orders of magnitude fewer people than to influence a nationwide poll . 
  idk about lithuania , but here both this fact and the fact that the smartness of the representatives is not significantly greater that the smartness of the voters are readily observable . 
  non-binding referenda are an exercise in futility . 
  direct democracy should either carry the same weight , or not exist at all . 
  what is this half-baked concept worth ? 
  an expensive poll . 
  interesting , i thought you operated from minas morgul . 
  i was thinking about the eu as a whole . 
  my country is not really pussified into oblivion yet , but the influence from berlin and brussels is felt . 
  for example , the european court for human rights recently curtailed our practice of keeping caught migrants in detention facilities . 
  this particular problem can be remedied , but the influence is there . 
  including the ngos living from european grants . 
  / u/tavvvin that is what i heard repeatedly from swedes . 
  and not just one or two of them . 
  they might be lying , of course , or just afraid of telling how they feel . 
  let us face it , we live in a giant pussyville . 
  the swedish people have one major weakness that we czechs do not have . 
  they trust their government to have their best interests in its heart . 
  or at least , they used to trust their government for decades , because it used to work rather well . 
  now they are forced to come to terms with a painful disappointment , namely , that their government started believing in the whole `` humanitarian superpower '' concept so strongly that they imported hundreds of thousands of unemployable and culturally alien people into their welfare nest and made sweden a major attraction for approx . 
  2 billion other unemplyoable and culturally alien people . 
  we central europeans can not really comprehend the feeling of awe and betrayal . 
  we simply know that our politicians are lying scum capable of anything . 
  in the czech republic , the biological age of asylum seekers is determined with evaluation of x-rays of their wrists and skulls . 
  in doubt , pro reo , but these cases are rare . 
  refusal of the x-ray means that you are treated as an adult . 
  but the main thing that helps us from being overran is probably that the seekers get approximately 10 eur pro month in cash and are forced to live with their peers in a detention facility for a few weeks . 
  it is not attractive for the youth of bangladesh and congo to cross half the globe for this level of social services . 
  the swedish generosity , though , produces quite a pull factor . 
  in the suicidal atmosphere of contemporary europe , where mass murderers enjoy a wide range of rights , this is a surprisingly rational move . 
  in the best simon and garfunkel voice : `` if i cooooooooooould , i surely would ! '', 
  i can imagine it all too well , but the new rulers would come from the inside , not from the outside . 
  without ruthenia , czechoslovakia was not really complete anymore ;-), 
  truth hurts sometimes . 
  is there any swedish statistics regarding `` how big percentage of all welfare spending in sweden is spent on first and second generation immigrants '' , possibly split further into groups according to the country of origin ? 
  in finland , they studied that and found that yes , mena immigrants are a major burden on the welfare system . 
  ( see : http://vatt.fi/documents/2956369/4207575/t185.pdf/466d79aa-ec0d-4982-9b5d-e45b536d6ae2 ) but it strikes me as a topic which would be very controversial in sweden . 
  i met only a few people who could be described by your words . 
  most people are just frustrated by the top dogs and wishing that their opinions on some topics were not ignored . 
  that said , if you speak about the politicians , not the voters , you are onto something . 
  i can not speak for the czech republic as a whole , and i will not attempt to . 
  true is that the expectations upon joining the eu in 2004 were different in some crucial aspects . 
  for example , we expected the schengen outer border to be defended vigorously . 
  our slovak friends had to fortify their ukrainian border and were constantly checked on by the european authorities whether they do it right . 
  fair enough , these were the conditions . 
  but 10 years later , we 're importing thousands of totally unknown people from the libyan coast and taxiing them to europe , this is a travesty . 
  the eu has enough diplomatic and economic clout to persuade the libyans to put a stop to this , but they seem to be unwilling to . 
  having de-facto open border with chaotic warrior statelets in north africa makes me cringe . 
  and not just me , pretty much everyone i speak to , across our political map ( lefties , righties , centrists ) . 
  only a few green voters seem unconcerned , but the greens are not a big party over here . 
  this map basically confirms that east germans are of slavic origin . 
  the distance between them and the rest of the western slavs is smaller than the distance between them and , say , the dutch . 
  tbh a lot of the slavic heritage still lives in the local toponyms . 
  i can understand the meaning of many local names in east germany , which are probably incomprehensible to german speakers ( jasnow , wostrow , kurnick ) . 
  you are right , there was no strict obligation . 
  only prudence . 
  you might have saved yourself the whole blitz , coventry etc. , if the contemporary ruling class just understood that the sudetenland wo n't be last of hitler 's demands , and that czechoslovak industrial capacity ( including arms factories ) was just given freely to your future enemy . 
  that said , hindsight is 20/20 . 
  chamberlain probably really believed that he were saving the european peace . 
  / u / - plastic - , you are speaking of a hypothetical common course of cca 400 million people speaking a babel of languages . 
  i do n't believe that europe is united ( and unitable ) enough for this . 
  even a relatively modest attempt , such as the maastricht convergence criteria , has failed . 
   merkel not being allowed to express her opinion my point is that utterances of top world politicians are not `` just opinions '' in the same way that yours or mine or bulgarian minister 's of agriculture . 
  surely this is readily observable through the entire history of the world and you do not have to be so combative around this factoid . 
  you are right , i made a mistake . 
  we had a defence treaty with france , which in turn had treaty with britain . 
  in practice , if the french honored their obligation and went to war with germany , britain would almost certainly be pulled in . 
  to be used as a deterrent against whom precisely ? 
  that probably depends on whether you count a million african migrants who came over the sea into europe as `` success '' . 
  for caritas etc. , they are clients , so the current state of libya may be `` success '' for them . 
  for the rest of us , who foot the bills and have to live with the question `` how many of those people were sent in by the islamic state as sleepers '' , post-gaddafi libya is an epic failure . 
  the political weight of germany in the eu is so big that `` just opinions '' of the chancellor are not equal to `` just opinions '' of , say , the bulgarian minister of agriculture . 
  more often than not , the german government gets what it wants . 
  who speaks for africa or asia ? 
  pretty much every integration and cooperation project hits the rocks in the moment when the participants realize that , in the long run , most entities ( states , people ... ) will act according to their own interests . 
  czechoslovakia had defence treaties with britain and france before wwii . 
  that helped us a lot ... once they realized that germans are willing to go to war over sudetenland , they threw us to the wolves . 
  nato seems to be headed in the same direction . 
  if the new turkish sultan really starts to rebuild the `` glory '' of the ottoman empire in reality rather than in words , and annexes bulgaria or southern cyprus one day , no one in europe will rush to the aid of the victims , and merkel will not make an exception . 
  edit : we had a treaty with france , which had treaty with britain . 
  not the same as direct treaty with britain , sure . 
  in practice , the british were considered to be on our side , should the war really break out . 
   it 's just that the government doesnt give a fuck about what we think . 
  stop living in a populist bubble . 
  this is actually what the populists say : that the government ignores wishes of major parts of the population . 
  szydlo said poland `` will not participate in the brussels elites ' folly . '', 
  she said poland is extending aid to people in refugee camps in the middle east . 
  concerning the attack in which the polish couple died , orphaning two daughters , she asked : ** `` where are you headed , europe ? 
  rise from your knees and from your lethargy , or you will be crying over your children every day . 
  in all likelihood , the current government will not act on it . 
  first - the prime minister is not the type to adopt such controversial position . 
  second - there is a nasty coalition crisis underway and the bosses spend their days backstabbing one another in creative ways . 
  well we have election soon ( october ) .

i do n't see why it should . 
  they 're extreme football fans , who are generally awful everywhere you go . 
  it 's all about immigration . 
  some things are more important than money . 
  at least to me , the vision of an eu stretching to encompass the middle east and north africa awfully resembles the roman empire at the peak of its cockiness . 
  dammit , where did putin get the clairvoyant ? 
  that 's beside the point . 
  turkey is not europe and as such , should n't ever be allowed to join the eu . 
  what the hell have western european leaders been smoking lately ? 
  you 're missing the point . 
  they miss russia having a large sphere of influence , being a global superpower , and having other countries bowing to its military power . 
  possibly from europeans living in other parts of the world , like myself . 
  [ here 's ] ( http://www.novinky.cz/domaci/397653-mladi-ze-zapadu-miri-do-ceska-citi-se-tu-bezpecneji.html ) the original article , if you 're interested . 
  it 's even got interviews with some of the immigrants . 
  it 's very evident , walking around in prague ( where i actually currently do n't live , but i visit regularly ) , that the number of foreigners has increased massively . 
  now , i 'm actually quite glad that we 've grown into a country to which other europeans would like to migrate , no doubt about that . 
  the problem i see with that is that inevitably , middle easterners and north africans , be they born there or in western europe , will be coming too . 
  hopefully schengen will have disbanded before then , at least for non-trade purposes . 
  ( i doubt that . 
  any country exiting , be it a small one like portugal or the czech republic , would still spark lots of attention . ), 
  as we know it , almost certainly , except for some sort of inevitable closer union between germany and benelux . 
  i 'm not against some sort of a european community at all , but i 'd certainly prefer one with a less cumbersome and more effective political structure , a simpler electoral system ( people do n't care enough to go vote in european elections when they 've already voted in their national elections , which means that a niche can easily be overrepresented in the ep ) , and less power , especially over asylum politics . 
  its main purpose would be some sort of a free trade pact . 
  we do take white refugees . 
  in fact , the largest foreigner minority in the czech republic is ukrainians , to whom we 're opening our doors quite warmly . 
  refugees from similar cultures is exactly what we want , not middle easterners . 
  as for russians , even though we certainly would take some of you , i 'd expect quite a lot of public disagreement all over the v4 ; no need to explain why , i 'm sure . 
  did n't expect anything different . 
  i really doubt that one big , rich country exiting alone would guarantee an eu reform . 
  it certainly might set off a chain reaction though , which would possibly be the kind of large-scale series of exits i 'm looking forward to . 
  on the contrary , i 'm very much in favor of regulating firearms . 
  i 'm not , however , under the na\u00efve illusion that it will solve all our problems with terrorists . 
  it sure will stop the average person getting a gun and committing a homicide , which i 'm a strong supporter of , but people like the paris attackers ( charlie hebdo and bataclan alike ) and these guys in bruxelles will always have the networks to get firearms . 
  [ just last month ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/europe-greece-iraqis-idusl8n15t06v ) , two iraqi kurds were arrested on the greek-turkish border , trying to smuggle 200,000 cartridges and 4 pistols into turkey . 
  after a couple of days , they found more of these guys in a turkish town near the border with 27,000 cartridges and 18 rifles . 
  now imagine how many times this goes by unnoticed every year , and you can see the scale of the problem . 
  they are n't forbidden . 
  and even if they were , these guys would still get their hands on them . 
  same here . 
  just hoping that this whole thing will end before it spills over to us . 
  at this point , it seems that the only thing that will guarantee an eu reform in a major way is a large-scale series of exits . 
  as such , thumbs up from me !, 
  even though that 's better than just having a pin , the second option ( one-time verification code ) should be the ** default ** one . 
  after all , it 's people 's personal information we 're talking about here . 
  i take it you 've never lived in greece and do n't know any greeks . 
  i 'd say there 's three parts to the justification of not necessarily nationalist movements but a rejection of middle eastern immigration to the czech republic . 
  ** first part - historical experience ** just as every single european country , czechs have deep ties to their national history . 
  the closest historical example of multiculturalism in the czech lands is the [ sudetenland ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/sudetenland ) - a multi-ethnic ( and thereby multicultural ) region of the country , characterized by a majority of german speakers . 
  just to give you an idea of the scale of this multicultural experience , germans ( the [ census ] ( https://cs.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/obyvatelstvo_\u010ceska ) statistics do n't mention austrians , so i assume the two were grouped together ) made up 30.6 % of the total population of the area of the modern-day czech republic in 1921 and 29.5 % in 1930 . 
  excluding the various language and ethnicity-based problems with the german population towards czechs and czech jews , the big problem started when hitler gained power in germany . 
  as germans , the vast majority of the population of the sudetenland sympathized with hitler and wanted to join nazi germany . 
  with permission from chamberlain and daladier , hitler then entered czechoslovakia and occupied and annexed the sudetenland , with the local population cheering him on , throwing roses , etc. 
  this occupation and annexation was then exacerbated by the munich agreement , under which hitler occupied the rest of the czech lands . 
  needless to say , more ethnic and language-based discrimination followed rapidly . 
  if you want further examples of this `` czech-german multiculturalism '' in action , just read up on austria-hungary . 
  czechs are worried that by accepting middle eastern migrants , the country would be importing the problems plaguing other western and northern european nations , in this case , drawing an analogy between the allegiance of sudeten germans to hitler and muslim migrants to isis and other islamist groups . 
  ** second part - foreigners and the roma in the czech republic now ** these days , czechs have , i 'd say , a generally good relationship with foreign nationals living in the country , with around 4.2 % of the country 's population made up of people holding foreign passports . 
  the three most populous [ foreign minorities ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/czech_republic ) are ukrainians ( 106,714 ) , slovaks ( 89,273 ) , and vietnamese ( 61,102 ) , who are gradually and quite successfully assimilating into the general czech population . 
  the most popular czech news agency even has a pleasant special series called [ `` foreigners in brno '' ] ( http://zpravy.idnes.cz/cizinci-v-brne-0fo-/domaci.aspx?klic=64254 ) with people from all over the world talking about their experiences in the country . 
  even as the official policy on the integration of foreigners into the country is assimilation , there will always be a degree of multiculturalism in between arrival and assimilation . 
  in addition to foreign nationals living in the country , there is also the infamously known [ local roma minority ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/czech_republic ) ( 40,000 - 300,000 ; 0.4 % - 3 % ) , just like in the rest of the european continent , which has refused to assimilate over hundreds of years and is , therefore , unlikely to ever do so . 
  examples of this range from [ chanov ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/ch\u00e1nov_housing_estate ) and [ lunik ix . 
  ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/lun%c3%adk_ix ) to huge problems with roma children and elementary school teachers in slovakia . 
  czechs worry that a similar integration problem would plague midde eastern migration to the country , even more so than with the roma , due to the extreme cultural and religious ( the vast majority of czechs is atheist ) differences between the populations . 
  as such , the czech republic has plenty of experience with foreigners , immigration , multiculturalism , and assimilation , as much as many western european politicians and journalists like to think otherwise , be it due to ignorance or intentional misleading . 
  ** third part - information and experience from abroad ** as a user from the uk mentioned in the discussion under this post , eastern europeans have both personal experience and , of course , information from abroad . 
  this means that we can learn from the mistakes of other countries and prevent these problems from spreading into out countries as well before they get here . 
  trying to suggest that we need to feel the problems with middle easterner migration in our own countries before forming an informed opinion is both disingenuous and idiotic . 
  thank you . 
  ** edit : ** in case you 'd like to question my experience with islam and middle eastern culture , i 'd like to inform you that i currently live in the most populous muslim country in the world , indonesia , and have friends from all over the middle east , including turkey , syria , lebanon , palestine , jordan , and israel . 
  wow . 
  because the fear of a religion , which encourages the killing of apostates and denies women 's rights , is tantamount to fearing foreign nationals in general . 
  bravo . 
  not even the government is xenophobic ; we 've just agreed to a direct beijing-prague flight and are welcoming millions of tourists from all over the world , irrespective of race and religion . 
  if you want to use a pejorative adjective to describe the `` horrid v4 '' , just use `` islamophobic '' , which we like anyways . 
  there 's significant vietnamese , ukrainian , and other communities in the czech republic , the size of which perceptibly increases every year . 
  it 's islam that we dislike . 
  check which borders have had schengen suspended right now . 
  you 'll find it 's more than just your , apparently , biggest enemy right now , the v4 , but also the `` willkommenskultur '' states . 
  what the v4 is trying to do is actually finally stop the flow of migrants from greece , instead of having summits about it for months and coming back with threats from erdogan . 
  i used the term `` representative '' to refer to the unlikeliness of finding atheist middle easterners among the general population . 
  when i say that the current migrants are representative of the general population , it 's because every adult woman i 've seen on photo and video so far has worn a hijab ( except for this one : http://youtu.be/o1lnxuxwgge ) . 
  even though the majority of the migrants is male , the fact that 87 % of the syrian population is muslim coupled with the proportion of hijab-wearing women makes it quite apparent that the migrants are representative of each country 's general population . 
  i do n't know where you 're from , but in france , belgium , and the uk ( i have n't heard about the other countries with significant muslim minorities , but that 's probably just because i do n't hear very much about , say , the netherlands and muslim ghettos there ) , many if not most muslim communities are segregated , correlating with a higher likelihood of radicalisation and a lack of integration . 
  there is no reason to expect anything different from the current migrant population . 
  well , in terms of religion and culture , at least , they are . 
  i , of course , do n't know about their socioeconomic standing and how it compares to those staying back in the countries of origin , but it is reasonable to assume that the incoming migrants are a representative sample . 
  and if there are individuals who are vastly different , the sheer number makes the percentage of the unrepresentative group tiny . 
  i will add that it 's quite hard to the migrants to actually get work permits , so i do sympathize at least on that level , but seeing as we were sold the myth of `` qualified engineers '' and `` professional doctors '' , it certainly seems like welfare is all they want . 
  that 's why finland and sweden are very popular destinations . 
  so to you , the ecb wanting to stop issuing $ 500 notes is akin to a road to communism ? 
  you 've clearly never lived through it or learned anything about it . 
  the ones i do know are not a representative sample of the general middle eastern population , while the incoming migrants are . 
  i do n't deny that there sure are problems with the latino community in the us . 
  there is , however , a much smaller cultural and religious difference between the average american and latino than the average european and middle easterner . 
  i know about a dozen middle eastern refugees personally , give or take a few , including syrians , palestinians , jordanians , and lebanese . 
  the difference between them and the general populations of those countries is that the majority is atheist . 
  edit : as for muslims in general , i live in the most populous muslim country in the world at the moment , so i 'd say i 've got more experience with islam and muslims than you , including the general opinions about atheists like myself . 
  a ) i do , but in that case , i 'm the one making the choice to pursue that course of action . 
  in this current situation , i 'm not .

  it 's like the english people , they are all english now based on the most powerful tribe who inhabited the area , but there have been many other tribes who just got assimilated and ruled by the english . 
  bohemia is much older name . 
  it 's celtic and based on the celtic boii tribe , who gave the name to the country . 
  the name still remain . 
  moravia is named based on the river of morava , so it 's basically the land around the morava river . 
  the name is also very old and comes from pre-celtic people who inhabited the area . 
  the name means water/sea in old indo-european language . 
  many people who live in moravia region today ( especially the southern part ) , call themselves moravians . 
  silesia is named also based on river name : sleza . 
  the origin is unclear , but it 's probably from the old slavic word for moisture/humidity . 
  people of czech republic are ethnically one group , so it depends where you live and how much you identify with the particular area . 
  that would have to be the [ lands of the bohemian crown ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lands_of_the_bohemian_crown ), 
  hell yes !, 
  it 's interesting , how similar the dutch and czech situation was back then . 
  we were almost there as well , but unlike the dutch , we lost against the catholic armies and the emperor . 
  so the dutch had golden age after that and we had the dark ages . 
  some call us [ fairytale land ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw9xxmv2ykg ) / s, 
  holly roman empire before that, 
  everyone chant '' \u010ce\u0161i do toho '' . 
  i 've never heard this ( and i 'm from bohemia ), 
  i do n't mind the short names in other languages either , but it sounds weird in english . 
  i would rather see czechland than czechia, 
  we 're ready for this glory, 
  it 's from the old czech , the digraph `` cz '' was used until the 16th century reform when replaced by '' \u010d '', 
  czechland would n't sound bad either, 
  when tournaments , we say '' \u010ce\u0161i , \u010ce\u0161i , . . '' `` czechs , czechs , . . '', 
  let 's call us lothl\u00f3rien , the fairest land in the ~ ~ middle-earth ~ ~ central europe . 
  i do n't have a problem with our current name , but i do n't like czechia . 
  i would personally use the czechlands as alternative , coz its old czech term for all historical parts of today 's czech republic ( bohemia , moravia , silesia ) + we would be closer to my favorite country : the netherlands < 3, 
  lucky france . 
  we have n't got such offer from austria , only stop temelin campaign . 
  white race does n't exist , it 's a fake term . 
  gypsy people belong to europoid/caucasian race so does you . 
  italian politicians must work really hard for such salaries . 
  guns are definitely not the answer . 
  you need better law enforcement and better communication between police and gypsy ethnicity . 
  we have gypsy police and gypsy communicators who help with communication , easing tensions and better law enforcement . 
  the situation here is much better than years ago . 
  kotleba is pure nazi . 
  so , it 's not surprising , that he uses any excuse he can find to let his ideology to be seen . 
  if there is any crime , it 's the work of police . 
  it always strike me , how is slovakia prone to radicals in such numbers . 
  good !, 
  you need to know facts behind such statistics . 
  do you really think , that germany , cz and austria discriminate against women and poland , italy and romania are the examples of emancipated and feminist societies ? 
  you do n't believe it yourself . 
  for example , cz has one of the longest maternity/paternity leaves in the world . 
  you can chose how long you want to have it . 
  also , many women work part-time . 
  there is always room for improvement ( more company kindergartens , wider spectrum of part-times , better social policy for young families , etc. 
  would be welcomed ) . 
  stupid idea, 
  the first picture - the blind pioneer , looks like he is painted, 
  since the disputes with the west , russia was looking eastward to china due to economic potential . 
  state propaganda plays major role in this . 
  so it goes well with the state propaganda actually, 
  let 's do this : * our northern neighbours , we like your bravery . 
  truly proud nation , who wo n't get down on knees even in the darkest hours . 
  * our little eastern neighbours , we like your temperament and mountains . 
  your language is nice and often funny . 
  * southern neighbours , we like your nature , lovely small towns and vienna . 
  we share a lot , more then we admit sometimes . 
  * our big western neighbour , we like to look up to you in many fields . 
  you have influenced us greatly . 
  we like your weihnachtsmarkts and we love shopping . 
  russian , they love : beating people :-d not much have changed, 
  well , that 's very difficult to say . 
  the celtic dna trace is very little and it vary on the region ( southern and western regions are more genetically conservative ) . 
  anyway , you still might have the possibility of the druid blood in your veins :-), 
  yep , what is now the czech republic , it was part of the celtic homeland where celts originated . 
  there are many celtic archaeological sites and we like to think , that we have still some connection with them . 
  i myself , live few kilometers from celtic oppidum . 
  eu has no military forces . 
  only the alliance of big eu states ( uk , france , germany , poland , italy ) could make counterpart to russia . 
  unfortunately , each state has its own interests regarding defence system and regarding russia . 
  i ca n't imagine those states to send military to defend let 's say baltic countries ( maybe , except poland ) . 
  they would send note and strengthen sanctions . 
  the only viable option for ee countries are usa , because they operate on different level ( global ) and have different interests . 
  as you can see , they do n't send just note , but also military forces to repel any potential idea , which russia may have regarding baltics . 
  ireland , the best land !, 
  celtic heritage , guinness , st patrick 's day we love everything celtic, 
  definitely not ppl with czech heritage . 
  ethnic kazakhs are muslims . 
  slavic population , which comprise 30 % of the population , is christian or atheist . 
  still , they are the sixth most favourable based on this survey . 
  cz is probably the most pro-jew country in eu , so you 'll find hardly better ranking among other countries . 
  yep , sugar is added to almost everything . 
  human body is not used to such enormous amounts of industrial sugar . 
  i recommend this [ docu ] ( https://vimeo.com/106120127 ), 
  do n't worry , we like you, 
  no way, 
  was n't something similar around like one month ago ? 
  why they do n't aks people like : do you like to have a polite , good behaved , friendly neighbour no matter ethnicity or nationality ? 
  coz i would definitely say yes , as the majority of people i guess, 
  have you ever been in relationship ? 
  still , in regards of cheating , i would trust women 100 % more then men, 
  exactly . 
  usually , those untrustful and jealous men are cheaters themselves . 
  definitely , every woman whos long-term boyfriend/husband ask them for paternity test is going to be filled with joy and unconditional love towards them . 
  i would understand such action in some open-relationship or in some very unusual situation , but to ask your loved one like ... and btw , let 's do paternity test tomorrow . . i would kick such guy hundred feet away .

  homosexuality was dropped because research found no difference in mental health of homosexuals , but that 's not true for the transgender . 
  when transgender people have significantly higher suicide attempts and various other problems , it calls for a attention of a medical science and deserve a classification in a manual . 
  this has nothing to do with lgbt rights , it 's a simple fact . 
  you did mention def/adblue . 
  that 's what aoc is . 
  amonia oxidation catalyst . 
  anyway my point is that if you want a cheap dirty engine now you can just buy an old car . 
  yet people buy new cars with all the expensive technology . 
  the article is just an example of environmentalist scaremongering . 
  it takes relatively minor concern and blows it out of proportion . 
  new diesel cars are clean , just not as clean as regulators , fooled by the automotive lobby , thought . 
  primary damage was done to the credibility of our regulators and automotive industry . 
  which leads to the obvious question why should we insist on the emission standards dreamed up by the people , who did n't quite know what they are doing ? 
  by the way i said to relax the standards not completely abolish them . 
  ... and consume much more gasoline . 
  clean combustion goes hand in hand with efficiency . 
  i do n't know . 
  i do n't believe people would go wild and buy only dirty cars . 
  just as if you were to legalise some drugs , it would not cause some drug addiction pandemic . 
  perhaps it 's different in the netherlands . 
  here people are very free-spoken , when they do n't like something they will tell you . 
  still when i hear locals , months after , to say there have been no problems with criminality or anything , but they would still prefer a prison in their backyard , i have to wonder how seriously should i take that information . 
  while it is at least partially true , it 's also true the common man should get his shit together . 
  if he wants to participate in decision making , he should do it properly . 
  that means to educate himself to make informed decisions . 
  it 's wrong to just go with his frustrations and whatever he is fed with on facebook or wherever else . 
  people have moral responsibility to be better . 
   ceta 's investment court system ( ics ) grants highly enforceable rights to investors -- but no corresponding obligations . 
  status quo is greatly in favour of domestic industry . 
  foreign investors have obligation to obey the law as anybody else , but unlike the local companies they do n't have as easy access to lobbying and other ways to influence legislation . 
  naturally primary purpose of all these regulations is protectionism . 
  safety , environment etc. 
  is just an elaborate excuse for the general public . 
  did you already forget about the syriza ? 
  or farange , who is effectively out of business with brexit . 
  as the article says , actually winning election is a bad for populists , because they usually do n't have viable plan or skills to manage the state . 
   millions of polluting cars remain on european roads , despite research showing that they emit three times the current standard for nitrogen oxide pollution , when driven in real world situations . 
  as if we need to worry about about the new and by all reasonable standards clean cars despite the scandal as opposed to ten or twenty years old cars which remain on the european roads . 
  it would be probably for the best to relax the standards and let the consumer decide . 
  that way there is a better chance the published results will be closer to reality . 
  where next ? 
  after the one-two punch of brexit and trump , europeans are watching every coming election , from austria to the netherlands to france , for fear it could become the next staging post in the long march to illiberalism . 
  europe 's centrists have begun to see themselves as modern-day defenders of the alamo , desperately standing their ground as marauding populists advance on all sides . 
  the siege of the alamo ended when the mexican army overran the fortress , slaughtering the doughty texans inside . 
  today 's equivalent might be the elevation of marine le pen , leader of france 's far-right national front , to the \u00c9lys\u00e9e in next year 's presidential election . 
  victory for ms le pen , it is widely assumed , would herald a new age of anti-european nationalism . 
  quite possibly it could mean the disintegration of the european union itself . 
  perhaps . 
  but ms le pen has amply demonstrated that she does not need electoral victory to bend french politics to her will . 
  indeed , the lesson from elsewhere in europe is that the responsibilities of power can be poisonous for populists : support for the nationalist finns party has halved since it joined a coalition in finland last year . 
  they do better carping from the sidelines , tugging policy in their direction while reserving the right to lob political bombs when necessary . 
  from trade to migration to budgets , europe 's populists are already shaping policy to a degree that belies their limited success at the ballot box . 
  few may have yet penetrated the fortress keep . 
  but they are hurling infected missiles over the walls , and the liberals inside are already succumbing to the virus . 
  take trade . 
  for years european governments have fought among themselves over whether to raise tariffs on state-subsidised exports , such as chinese steel . 
  but the populist assault on globalisation has lent the discussion fresh urgency . 
  in october jean-claude juncker , president of the european commission , said that the eu needed better trade defence instruments to take on `` stupid populists '' , and the issue is now chefsache -- so important that it must be negotiated among european leaders rather than their ( often better-informed ) ministers . 
  anti-trade agitators on the left , meanwhile , have forced governments advocating agreements with america and canada on to the back foot . 
  officials now argue that left untackled , chinese dumping will kill the public consent needed to strike trade deals . 
  on migration , too , populist pressure has transformed a debate over how to manage refugee movements into an almost exclusive focus on keeping people away . 
  and although for now the attention is on migrants from outside europe , populists will readily exploit french fears of polish plumbers , or german angst over romanian welfare tourists , should it prove expedient . 
  to stave off such anxiety , the eu will probably soon oblige firms employing workers temporarily posted from elsewhere in europe to match local pay and conditions . 
  the commission , backed strongly by france , says the measure is needed to tackle what it calls `` social dumping '' ; eastern european governments consider this a scandalous breach of single-market rules . 
  but the populist effect also shows up in what politicians choose not to do , notes heather grabbe , director of the open society european policy institute , a think-tank . 
  glancing fearfully over their shoulders at the populist menace , governments shy away from controversial decisions , or hedge their support for treaty commitments like helping refugees . 
  the european central bank has warned that populism will curb governments ' enthusiasm for the fiscal and structural reforms needed to inject a bit of life into flagging economies ( and to reduce the euro zone 's dependence on cheap money ) . 
  recent trade rows will give most leaders pause before declaring themselves in favour of the next deal . 
  the populist threat also provides governments with a handy `` apr\u00e8s nous , le d\u00e9luge '' excuse in their disputes with each other , or with brussels . 
  both france and italy have successfully pleaded for fiscal forbearance before the commission , which monitors the euro zone 's dreaded budget-deficit limit of 3 % of gdp , to see off their domestic political insurgencies . 
  ( `` i prefer to have a france with [ a deficit of ] 4.4 % today than a france with marine le pen tomorrow , '' matteo renzi , italy 's prime minister , once said . ), 
  the best explanation for the tough line the remaining 27 members will take in the coming brexit negotiations is their fear that a good deal for britain would leave their own eurosceptics clamouring for so many carve-outs and exemptions that the eu would be left a hollow shell . 
  remember the berlaymont the populist nudge need not always be dangerous . 
  mr juncker may have a case that the eu needs to revisit its trade-defence policy ; america allows itself to impose far higher tariffs on chinese steel imports than europe does . 
  on migration , experts had long highlighted the dangers of eliminating most border checks inside the eu before strengthening its external frontiers . 
  if it took a crisis to expose the folly -- well , better late than never . 
  the trouble is that in all these cases governments have lost control of the argument and ceded political ground to parties whose appeal they do not understand . 
  allowing populists to make the running while deploring their views presents voters with a confusing proposition . 
  observing the erection of trade barriers or border fences , some may wonder why they should fear the outfits that proposed such ideas in the first place . 
  europe has known little but crisis for years , and crises rarely make for smart policy . 
  but when europe 's fearful mood lifts , its leaders will need to find the courage to manage the populist threat rather than to be led by it . 
  the alamo may have ended in disaster , but the texans regrouped and eventually battled their way to victory . 
  perhaps in time europe 's beleaguered liberals can find the courage to do the same . 
  there is no duplicate thread . 
  the other post is 2 days old , this press conference is from yesterday . 
  i think even with the `` diplomatic talk '' he could afford to be more harsh . 
  eu is supposed to stand for human rights and democracy . 
  he should have hinted castro lacked those values . 
  [ juncker 's full statement ] ( http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_statement-16-4042_en.htm ), 
  this is ridiculous . 
  i posted it as any other submission . 
  you are blowing it out of proportion , as if i was posting main kampf without context and proper commentary , or something of similar calibre . 
  i not going to be controlled by your or anyone else 's hysterical reactions , tip toe around sensitive subjects and wrap them in lengthy disclaimers , introducing myself , my beliefs and my interpretation of the text . 
  as if that were that were the only permissible way to present something , which may spark disagreement . 
  i think it 's you who should think about your way of consuming news . 
  if you first reaction to information , which contradicts your beliefs or offends your sentiments , is to shower op with personal attacks and inventing some rules on the fly , why it should be forbidden ( i did not brake any rules ) , then you are harming this subreddit , not me . 
  that 's very nice score . 
  perhaps . 
  i think better political culture can reduce corruption and better systems can improve it , but i think it 's a mistake to think this nationalism is only in the us . 
  apparently quite a few people took offence i chose to post article about potential corruption in germany , while it 's perfectly acceptable here for europeans to comment on the us .

  this sounds like denial of reality . 
  how long it is when there were riots in paris and whole row of cars was burning ? 
  was this also staged ? 
  i think you see eastern europe as beggars ungrateful for your coin . 
  this is not widely shared view there . 
  greece has one of the largest armies in europe , yet they are not able to lift a finger . 
  why should ( now ) geographically more lucky countries suffer for your inability to protect your borders ? 
  do you pay baltics money because you got nice mediterranean climate and they have shitty cold and dark winters ? 
  do you pay ransom to landlocked countries ? 
  it would be more just : winters are nobody 's fault , your troubles are 100 % self-inflicted .

  i did ( ~ 15 years ago , in aachen ) . 
  i really admired the place . 
  but past glory does n't imply the future . 
  have you seen that infamous video from suhl ? 
  hunderds of thousand of completely unknown people freely crossing borders feels as proper security to you ? 
  how do you feel when someone uninvited visits your house ? 
  i remember few days ago german minister of interior made such noises . 
  and also bavarian ( or saxon ? ), 
  i remember few days ago german minister of interior made such noises . 
  and also bavarian ( or saxon ? ), 
  that 's diversity for you . 
  not everybody is like a lemming going to the cliff . 
  bastards will survive . 
  few days ago i saw here a video from suhl ( later deleted ) . 
  technically they were no more roaming but it made hardly any difference . 
  if you ask about the politicians then czech ones just today refused such call from the austrian pm . 
  [ * ] ( http://www.ceskenoviny.cz/news/zpravy/schengen-external-border-must-be-closed-czech-deputy-pm-babis/1251159 ), 
  for czechs western means predominantly germany . 
  i have n't been in england . 
  he 's a self-made oligarch , one of the largest , who stormed into the politics two years ago . 
  he 's minister of finance and deputy pm but in reality it is him who makes ( or vetoes ) the most important decisions . 
  the official pm is a very weak politician from party in decline . 
  different parties , different official roles . 
  babi\u0161 had appeared out of political nothing two years ago , zeman is an old hand . 
  their opinion on immigration is shared by many czech politicians accross the political spectrum, 
  his party leads the polls and is still going up . 
  i doubt anybody cares about his nato ideas , closed borders is what resonates with the society . 
  current number is ~ 120k legals and estimated `` several tens of thousand '' illegals living in the czech republic . 
  ukrainians are perceived as able to assimilate . 
  these 70 syrians were pushed by germany and deeply resented by the population . 
  average czech wants to close the borders , that 's the proper solution for him . 
  western european countries accepted these people because it fitted their needs ( at least needs of the corporations ) . 
  they had full right to refuse . 
  germany did , as long as it was legally possible ( 7 years ) . 
  western european countries are currently unable to guarantee basic security to themselves . 
  do you think it is attractive for others how they are freely roamed by hordes of people from the most violent parts of the world ? 
  money from eu funds end up in pocket of crooks , through useless overpriced projects ( at least this is the case of the czech republic . 
  eu funds became synonym for corruption ) . 
  you probably overestimate how eu is seen here . 
  it * was * once perceived as beacon of prosperity and bright future but these times are long over . 
  now it feels more like madhouse , impotent one . 
  basically every nation in eastern europe thinks that you ( certain western countries ) suffer from suicidal tendencies ( regarding migration ) . 
  why should they participate in this ? 
  is being batshit crazy the new standard for civilisation ? 
  what german politicians want is seen as sucide pact elsewhere . 
  why should anyone do it ? 
  to follow yet another crazy ideology into inevitable bitter end ? 
  oops , you are right , regular elections will be in 2016 . 
  the september 2015 date is for some by-elections . 
  the idea is that there will be guards at the border and they will allow in only those with valid id/visa/etc . 
  even this number ( 70 ) was strongly opposed by several politicians ( president & former president among them ) and iirc there was a poll where most were against . 
  it was correctly perceived as salami tactic and pressure by germany . 
  they deport but * extremely * expensively . 
  from [ this ] ( http://zeit.de/feature/refugees-in-germany-deportation-flights-laws ) article : deportation flight on 19th november 2014 to tbilisi , georgia . 
  * # of deportees : 18 * # of frontex staff : 57 * total cost 132,830 euro , meaning 7,380 euro per one deportee . 
  i bet luxurious trip around the world would be cheaper . 
  keeping promises is not a common habit of czech politicians . 
  it ( unilateral closing the border ) may eventually happen but right now everybody waits for someone else to make the first move . 
  my bet is on germany , then it will go fast . 
  this was pr action by the minister of interior ( he 's very ambitious ) . 
  he talked about sending powerful force of 20 policemen . 
  nothing came out of it , afaik . 
  yes , everything was there . 
  a mouse would n't be able sneak through . 
  former czechoslovakia had very effective border protection ( mainly to keep people from escaping to the west ) . 
  for this reason it sounds so attractive today . 
  hardly anybody here cares about greece . 
  it is intended for domestic consumption . 
  the key point is closing the schengen , something what 80 % people here support . 
  i perceive it as ( a ) pre-elections propaganda and ( b ) verbal preparation for unilateral closing of the border , if germany does not act quickly enough . 
  czech army was already asked to prepare plans for sending soldiers to guard them . 
  czech reductor of power flows should be ready [ by the end of 2016 ] ( https://www.ceps.cz/eng/media/pages/faq.aspx ) and i read somewhere the construction is coordinated with poland . 
  this proposal does not mean any action by czech state right now . 
  it is targeted mainly to the public : in two months we have regional * and * senate elections and babi\u0161 ' party already leads the polls . 
  because of the mood among the people ( ~ 80 % are against * any * illegal immigration and they see it major problem ) he is now trying to ensure complete victory . 
  i believe all these countries are impatiently waiting on germany to give the signal . 
  i believe all these countries are impatiently waiting on germany to give the signal . 
  czech republic would be glad to shut down its borders too if germany does . 
  it would solve the current uneasy state when czech policians fear to do anything by themselves . 
  the army claimed it can deploy up to 2,500 soldiers to protect the border . 
  i had to look it up , what does it mean . 
  but indeed , it was there . 
  brno is largest city in moravia . 
  nothing of note happens there . 
  unless it is staged and/or edited it really did portray reality as it is , not as some wish it to be . 
  in the czech republic there 's slow steady downward trend in public trust since 2004 when we entered eu .

  i dont doubt the organizational abilities of germans/northwest europeans . 
  it is about very strong negative reaction of native population in several eu countries , fear can bring people to do stupid/ugly decisions . 
  the eu is an union of 28 suvereign democracies . 
  for the eu to function properly , you need a certail level of goodwill from all participants . 
  but it will end when crazy/corrupt populists can easily win elections by promising shutting refugees/migrants out . 
  without closing the balkan road , there would be no schengen and maybe no eu to talk about in a few years . 
  the czech republic had net immigration gain in all years since 1990 , with exception of 2 years . 
  link to [ relevant statistic . 
  ] ( https://www.czso.cz/csu/czso/structure_of_total_increase_1950_2014 ) even last year , more czech citizens returned from abroad then how many emigrated . 
  i agree with you , but it is pretty hard to sophistically calculate what would be optimum population of europe . 
  fow my country , i am pretty satisfied . 
  we had 10.5 million people 100 years ago . 
  we have 10.5 million people now . 
  and latest eu projection predicts our population to oscilate between 10.5 and 11.0 million in next 60 years . 
  i agree with the author . 
  we are the same generation , and arrived at same conclusions i guess . 
  `` the median proportion of female inmates in the total prison population is 5 % '' ( first page ) . 
  czech kunda is probably loanword from middle high german ( kunt ) . 
  english cunt is probably loanword from proto-german kunton . 
  same origin . 
  dont paint a devil on the wall . 
  are czechs really so stupid ? 
  i am quite sure zeman was there too . 
  not pm but still ... 
  500.000 babies per year now , this number increases as the number of adults grows . 
  syria practically doubled its population between 1970 and 1990 , and then again between 1990 and 2010 . 
  in that case , all countries must take quota only from non-eu countries like turkey or jordan . 
  eu must strictly discourage people illegally entering italy , greece and balkan , or coming through tourist visa to apply for asylum . 
  syria before war had 21 million people , that is half of ukraine . 
  they get 500.000 babies per year , thus double their total population every 20 years . 
  europe cant take even half of their population ( not mentioning palestinians , irakis , afghans , eritreans , or ukrainians etc. ) . 
  thus , there will always be millions people in shitty refugee camps on eu outshirts for years to come . 
  world is a scary unfair place . 
  there has always been latent admiration of that wwii period in some slovakian circles . 
  first independent national state . 
  economic boom . 
  catholic priest as political leader . 
  getting rid of both jews and gypsies by handing them over . 
  just idylic times being hitlers ally . 
  this might sound bitter , while i dont feel any animosity to slovaks . 
  it was difficult time and everybody tried to survive , every nation has its good and bad people and interesting moments . 
  there is no ideal and painless solution to the current migrant crisis . 
  but , at the end of the day , practical solution will prevail . 
  what i think will/have to happen : closing free-for-all flow of people through balkan , lampedusa and elsewhere . 
  even with force . 
  eu helping greece and italy to accomodate and then deport people stuck there back to turkey/lybia . 
  more support for refugee camps around syria . 
  rich europe must get rid of asylum option on arrival , because it is immoral to reward people managing this cross-country deadly race . 
  it might seem inhumane , but its pull factor is too strong . 
  willing countries should send officials to refugee camps in middle east and hand-pick people they want to accept . 
  make backround checks and then fly them directly inland . 
  if europe would refuse any of these steps , greece will be fucked much more in long term . 
  destructed tourism industry , large flow of undocumented people crossing their country , with drug/arms dealers profiting from no-rules-land . 
  flow of isis fighters , criminals on run , maybe even slaves . 
  and rich we countries will reach their breaking point sooner or later anyway , but the later it happens , the more fractured and hating on each other the eu will be then . 
  we have the best relationship with all our neighbours we ever had . 
  freedom to move , work and study in close to 30 countries . 
  european customs union and green borders . 
  czechia will take their share over next few years from greece and italy , voted against quota , but our goverment accepts the result of majority vote . 
  the first few hundert should come in next weeks . 
  we already have an independent program for relocation from me refugee camps , in small numbers and preferably for most urgent cases - families with ill children , christians or other minorities . 
  we have also program for relocation of people from eastern ukraine , around thousand people or so planned this year . 
  ex-communist who put on different coat after revolution , but still part of old establishment , i guess . 
  forced redistribution of millions of muslim `` refugees '' is idiotic idea . 
  if germany will continue to press for it , the eu will fall . 
  but a unified system of refugee identification with fingerprints and so is very desirable . 
  our country will implement it in heartbeat . 
  germany and most of `` new '' europe ( cz , slovakia , poland , hungary , romania etc. ) . 
  cz is now in the boom phase of economical cycle . 
  we have 4,5 % rate of unemployment and our goverment will soften visa for ukrainians soon to cover workers shortage . 
  our gdp grew by 4,3 % last year , while our population is constant ( czechs dont emigrate to the west ) . 
  npl is 4 % - comming back near pre-crisis level of 3 % . 
  real wages grow by 4 % . 
  employment rate is highest since fall of communism . 
  czechs are most content/happy since 20 years according to surveys . 
  asylum seekers are prohibited to work . 
  the process takes on average over 1 year , when they appeal , it gets much longer . 
  the recent big wave started only last spring , thus most of the recent refugees are not counted among workforce yet . 
  it was 11,3 % one year ago . 
  steady decrease by around 0,1 % per month means european economy is recovering albeit slowly . 
  i dont know about this . 
  but i know that many czech tourists has become pretty wary of visiting countries and cities that either were hit by last terrorist attacks or that had large amounts of refugees going through or accumulating in them . 
  cancelling vienna christmas trips , paris weekends , greek islands reservations etc. 
  i can imagine that some young czechs that planned to study or get a summer job in western europe might change their plans now , because their parents might be too afraid to allow them to go . 
  czech exports make 84 % of our gdp , we are a small and extremelly open economy . 
  over 80 % of our exports go to the eu countries . 
  germany is our biggest market , and we have a high trade surplus with it economically speaking , we cant leave the eu , without taking a massive hit ... 
  while czechs always were critical to many eu policies ( we generaly dislike authorities ) , without the recent pressure for permanent refugee quotas through germany , czechs would not think about leaving the eu . 
  because in the grand scheme of everything , the pros are/were still more then the cons . 
  have you searched actively for job at least once in last 2 weeks ? 
  have you worked less then 1 hour last week ? 
  two yes answers and you are counted in this eurostat statistic . 
  all eu countries act according to refugee convention . 
  but not all countries attract so much people from third countries to misuse it to circumvent immigration laws to the same degree as germany and sweden . 
  they are seen as heaven on earth , because their people are rich and naive . 
  the two countries with the highest percentage of accepted asylum claims or agreed additional protection in the eu are actually bulgaria and the czech republic , around 50 % of applications for both . 
  if you get reaaaally desperate one day , try prague or other places in the czech republic . 
  salaries are shit , but you will land job on spot ( engineers have zero unemployment rate here ) . 
  treat it as working vacation , till you find something better in finland or germany . 
  hm , not bad .

  communication and data processing technologies influenced not only production and trade but also `` opinion making '' mechanisms in the society , making democratic processes unpredictable , volatile and easy influenced by various manipulations . 
  the fall of the soviet block made possible to sell the western politic system as victorious and optimal solution . 
  fall of the soviet `` communism '' was used for propaganda hiding or trivializing principal problems and internal conflicts of the system related to liberal economic principles and globalization . 
  these problems are now back on the table but much more serious . 
  marcon 's power is based on ad hoc pragmatic `` project '' movement , which is `` not-crystallized '' enough mass of people , despite pretending political party structure . 
  i am afraid they got to power too quickly and easy to be able govern efficiently and deliver results satisfying or at least acceptable for their supporters . 
  preventing le pen to rule and filon 's unscrupulous greed is a negative source of their election victory that ca n't be long lasting support needed for radical reforms of everything they promised . 
  inevitable inner development of his movement can be also source of instability . 
  the whole french society is deeply divided but they need cooperation and unity of much higher level that they were able in past . 
  to keep power and unity he could be forced to take very authoritative position , but he is not de gaulle to be forgiven for it . 
  tldr : macron is a child of a deep and broad crisis ; he can succeed only taking a very authoritative position keeping a democratic fa\u00e7ade to become a `` lord '' of the crisis . 
  i doubt it is possible in france now . 
  we should not ridicule them . 
  their effort looks like don quixote fighting windmills if we consider present situation of islam and history of it . 
  but such effort is very important because of reactions to it and rejection of it . 
  they put a problem on the table in the way that ca n't be ignored by islam authorities . 
  they must say no !, 
  aloud , because it is principally unislamic ; liberalism and islam are principally incompatible . 
  the core of the problem is not about burqua or position of women in the society . 
  it is about authority issuing rules and laws . 
  it is about contradiction of theocracy and self-ruling human society . 
  the core of islam - tawhid , an extreme conception of monotheism , is the central point of the conflict . 
  see for example the political system of iran . 
  there are all democratic institutions and instruments but there is also something in addition - the guardian council of the constitution . 
  and you can read in the iranian constitution this principles ( quoted after wikipedia ) : islamic republic as a system based on belief in : the one god , his exclusive sovereignty and right to legislate , and the necessity of submission to his commands ; divine revelation and its fundamental role in setting forth the laws ; ... ... the justice of god in creation and legislation ; continuous leadership and perpetual guidance , ... continuous leadership of the holy persons , possessing necessary qualifications , exercised on the basis of the quran and the sunnah , upon all of whom be peace ; sciences and arts and the most advanced results of human experience , ... . 
  this is not an ideology specific for iran . 
  the total subordination of society , its institutions and laws to the god through the mediation of `` holy persons , possessing necessary qualifications , exercised on the basis of the quran and the sunnah '' is directly derived from the tawhid . 
  western countries have constitutions based on the democratic principle , that for example in the czech constitution sounds : \u201e all state authority emanates from the people ; they exercise it through legislative , executive , and judicial bodies . `` how can people subdue to a constitution based on authority `` emanated from the people '' if they are required by their religion to subdue to his exclusive sovereignty and right to legislate , and to his commands expressed divine revelation ? 
  * this is not an easy task for christians of course , but this reply is not about relationship of christianity to democracy . 
  we should be aware , that whole history of christianity was searching of working relationship between the church and secular power . 
  jesus was accused by jewish authorities that he contradicts caesar and he defended himself saying `` my kingdom is not of this world '' . 
  what does it mean for people living in this world , christian philosophers and theologians searched from the time of apostles . 
  after christianity was accepted by the roman empire as tool to clue society and state there was always rivalry and competition for the power . 
  the french revolution pushed religion out of the political system and christianity become something accepted as a vague `` moral '' background or fought as an obscurantist enemy ; it depends on a personal disposition . 
  this history reveals , why including islam in the western society is so difficult . 
  if you say people in eastern europe that they should take migrants because western europe took people fleeing comunism from eastern europe in past it is not a convincing argument , because people living in eastern europe are those who did n't flee despite all the history . 
  chemical weapons : in the case of syria i do n't believe anything `` proved '' by us , french or british `` intelligence evidence '' . 
  barell bombs are dangerous and efficient but not banned . 
  usa used in vietnam , present iraqi army used it too . 
  bombing and killing civilians is called a `` collateral damage '' , see present battles of raqqa and mosul . 
  it is unavoidable if militants use a town as a fortress preventing civilians to flee . 
  i do n't say assad is a philanthropist . 
  syria is a country full of very brutal people and horrible violence have a long history there . 
  but i do n't know how to defend against islamists / jihadists without cruelty and enormous force . 
  there is no space for agreements with them . 
  west , saudis and turkey gave ( and give ) them weapons . 
  `` moderate '' syrian rebels are all jihadists , their goal is a state under sharia law . 
   authorise repeated gas attacks prove ? 
  did you meet him ? 
  some yes , some no !, 
  which of them ? 
  how many of them ? 
  by the way people living in eastern europe are those or descendants of those who did n't fled despite communism and genocide wars . 
  help does n't mean let them to move them in europe . 
  if the war is in big towns the causalities are big and rebels ( not only isis ) prevent people leave it . 
  syria was not state that was possible to rule simply like a democratic country . 
  it was too complicated and fragmentated full of conflicts some lasting hundreds of years . 
  see [ the list of armed groups in syria ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_armed_groups_in_the_syrian_civil_war ) . 
  rebels fight not only assad . 
  they fight mutually even being besieged by pro assad forces . 
  should assad let the country people that state `` islam is the solution '' , and `` allah is our objective ; the qur ` an is the constitution ; the prophet is our leader ; jihad is our way ; death for the sake of allah is our wish '' . ? 
  usa have to relay on ypg , that is related to ideology considered at least extremely leftist . 
  saudis support the worst jihadists and turkey would ally `` shaitan '' to prevent kurdish autonomy . 
  everybody there prepatriate war crimes there every day . 
  usa used allegedly white phosphorus bombing raqqa . 
  sf killed children trying to get from raqqua ( not intentionally ) . 
  it would not be so simple because there are too many different intersets . 
  turkey , saudi , iraq , iran , israel , usa , europe , russia . 
  poor syrian people , nobody cares about them . 
  but it is very good that france understands finally what is russian reason for intervention . 
  the fear of collapse is also main motive why assad did n't give it up . 
  he is not such monster as western propaganda depicts him . 
  he knew what is at stake and what forces are in the game . 
  a large part of them were not married comming here ( they were too young ) , so they would have to go back to find a woman from their nation . 
  if you knew urdu , pastho , farsi , somali etc. 
  you could make a fortune in europe now . 
   wait till the refugees reproduce in 2015 75 % of migrants were single young men !, 
  humans does n't reproduce asexually . 
  this is another puzzle i did n't hear how it should be resolved . 
  should we limit them to a street `` catcalling '' ? 
  adaptation to a culture is not asimilation or acceptance of values . 
  it can be about creating a parallel culture keeping maximum of autonomy and waiting for sufficient population growth . 
  because there was always just opposite flow of money . 
  but it say nothing about catholic church influence . 
  muslim institutions and communities never will be `` our '' . 
  it is a deep misunderstanding of islam to think it . 
   helping those in need there are hundreds of millions in need . 
  shall we move them in europe ? 
  i deeply agree with orban in this . 
  schengen transferred protection of our borders to other states . 
  they are bound to protect external borders by the treaty . 
  now they say it is impossible to protect it . 
  they had not promise it . 
  there are millions of people in africa and asia that would like to come here to live here . 
  if we are not able stop it now , how it would continue ? 
  there are 7,5 billions of people in the world , about 0,5 billion in eu . 
  it is about 6 % . 
  2 billion mostly muslims live in disfunctional countries in the area between marocco , turkey , pakistan and somalia . 
  what part of them should come in europe ? 
  african population is now 1.25 billions in 2050 it should be more 2,5 billions .

  they even bullied some russian doctors who were there . 
  confiscated their laptops and things . 
  in kuito specifically , there is a potential danger which is fortunately diminishing rapidly - weapons . 
  the town is surrounded by minefields ( some of them czechoslovak , i was told ) and people keep finding ammunition everywhere . 
  one time , a worker at our school construction site , came in the office , holding a mortar round and bashing it on the table , he said `` look what i found . '', 
  mines , combined with diabetes , spiders , parasites and infections in general , mean that a lot of people are missing a limb . 
  i mean , a lot of people . 
  i once met three schoolgirls , well-off ones , two of whom were missing an arm and one had only one leg . 
  and they were from richer families , bags , uniforms , everything . 
  most kids do n't even bring a pencil to school , just a stool to sit on . 
  the country is very catholic , and the church has a lot of influence on things . 
  but , tribal religions still exist . 
  it 's quite interesting . 
  when somebody is offended , they sometimes go to a shaman to put a curse on the person who offended them . 
  poverty is huge . 
  it 's a huge fucking difference when you come to the capital , luanda , and when you are in a village somewhere remote . 
  you can tell that although portuguese is the official language , it is still a second language to some people . 
  the original bangtu languages are still around ( around kuito it is umbundu ) . 
  those places are magical . 
  really untouched nature and traditional lifestyle . 
  no bullet holes or patches of tar from fires , the villages are beautiful . 
  very poor but beautiful . 
  but this is the thing - even though the people have little money and posessions , there are few things to do with them . 
  they are under a much lower financial pressure compared with the richer areas . 
  no rent to pay , or things like that . 
  their life is simpler that way . 
  although education and healthcare in remote areas is still a problem . 
  speaking of healthcare , it needs a lot of development . 
  someone told me that the mortality rate for the dentist in kuito is 13 % . 
  i think ( and hope ) it 's bollocks but this is what i was told . 
  truth is , most doctors need medicine and equipment . 
  medicine does get shipped to angola but apparently a part of it gets lost on the black market . 
  pharmacies are always guarded by guys with kalashnikovs . 
  you can also see guys selling pills on the street from a wheelbarrow . 
  fuck knows how that works . 
  infections are also a problem . 
  i was there during the dry season and that means dust everywhere . 
  even the smallest scratch gets infected instantly . 
  i always carried bandages and disinfection with me everywhere i went because it was desperately needed . 
  however , you need to be careful when treating someone 's wound , there is a danger of hiv and hepatitis . 
  food was pretty great . 
  not much selection but mainly fresh , decend food . 
  even in kuito , which is in central angola , you could get pretty fresh fish and squid at the town market . 
  there is a massive lack of spices and seasoning , which is a shock at the beginning but you get used to it quickly . 
  meat is scarce , though . 
  in most areas , they only kill a cow when it can no longer work so beef is tough when you get it and pork can be dangerous ( parasites ) . 
  but chicken is abundant , usually sold alive ( so home cooking can be gruesome ) and fruit and vegetables are very fresh and delicious . 
  we had an avocado tree in front of our office . 
  it was heaven to pluck a fresh one from the tree in the morning and spread it on a bun with some jindungo ( local chilli pepper ) for breakfast . 
  one last point , as this is getting long . 
  working there felt like it had a lot of meaning . 
  the students were openly grateful and the children hungry for knowledge . 
  you could see that the smallest bit of education made a great difference in their lives . 
  it really mattered to them . 
  we had very little materials , mostly teaching with just a board , no textbooks or multimedia . 
  but the work was very rewarding . 
  when i came back , i felt disgusted . 
  kids at school being demotivated ( although i teach adults now so that 's different but i was still a student back then ) , exams having some sort of meaning to people , the fucking complaints about there being nothing on television , the drama of catching a cold , etc. 
  dammit i really want to go back to angola now ... 
  i was teaching there . 
  my job was english and drama . 
  it was a developmental project focused on children in the street . 
  we were training young teachers and leisure pedagogues . 
  the idea was to give young people a job and educate the children ( if at least a bit ) and to fill their time doing something different . 
  there is a threat of social problems , such as drugs , violence , prostitution , etc. 
  so a big part of our job there was to discuss the risks and ways of prevention . 
  we were also building a leisure time centre for our people to have some base . 
  it mainly serves as a school today , as far as i have heard ( i was there in 2010 ) . 
  i really like your flair . 
  this . 
  national inferiority complex is an important component of the czech national identity . 
  a good deal of xenophobia in this country is rooted in the phrase `` they fucked us over . '', 
  ( i 'm not quite sure how this is connected but i have a strong feeling it is in some way ), 
  can we please stop this ? 
  this is starting to sound like the old playground `` my dad can beat up your dad '' type of discussion . 
  one more sparkle on the ocean , one fewer eel in the world 's hovercraft . 
  may his nipples explode with eternal delight . 
  i 'm sorry to hear that . 
  i understand that governments need to save their face ; everybody does . 
  but to knowingly take measures which might result in the starvation of your people as an act of retaliation is awful . 
  there is something very pointless about all this conflict . 
  i 'm sad about this . 
  from where you 're looking , can you see a danger for russian people to have their food variety reduced ? 
  does russia import a lot ? 
  is there enough domestic food ? 
  are you quoting alex dugin , by any chance ? 
  that 's helpful , thanks . 
  thanks for pointing that out . 
  we have something similar in this country too although on a much smaller scale . 
  there is a group of right-wingers who lead a campaign against supporters of multiculturalism . 
  they label them anti-patriots , xenophiles and enemies . 
  some email accounts were hacked . 
  sorry if i ask too much but do you have such problems in ireland too ? 
  ( edit : wording . 
  that was interesting , thank you . 
  i do n't feel like i understood it properly so i wo n't dare to make a statement about it ( i do n't read russian so i had to make do with a machine translation ) , however , i did pick up on a need for change through struggle and ( to quote google translator ) disagreement . 
  i 'll leave aside whether or not it is really happening . 
  what caught my eye was how the author spoke of enemies . 
  i do n't know what it means but it has to come from somewhere . 
  he seems to be standing in front of a problem and wants to solve it through struggle .

article talks about prejudice not volume . 
  while you 're right about low educated and old farts , it says they tend to agree , majority of men are different age group . 
  while cz is somewhat safe ( you be the judge , it 's anywhere between 7 to 20k anually ) survey proved woman wo n't often find support and will be blamed for this , which is horrible . 
  ------------------------------------ straight up google translate : the survey asked people 's opinion and whether a woman under certain circumstances for rape co-responsible - for example , if drunk , passes herself deserted place or provocatively dressed . '', 
  yes , '' corresponded roughly a third of respondents , and up to half of the men polled . 
  `` the strongest agreement pronounced men aged 18-34 years ... '', 
  czech republic is okay-ish with human rights . 
  while this is n't complete shithole , there 's a lot of room for improvement . 
  we 're pretty bad in gender pay gap , for instance . 
  some people apparently think that asking multiple indirect questions is cheating , but that 's how surveys works . 
  we 're talking about co-responsibility , men ( and women ) did n't say women deserve this , but they often think if women dress/drink/behave appropriately it would be better for them , which is ridiculous . 
  not i just used `` half '' , which is 50 % , but actual number is 45 % and that does n't change problem one but . 
  ( depending on question - flirting/drinking/dressing , etc ), 
  i said * men * , not respondents . 
  clearly women think differently , but men got a different idea . 
  you can see actual numbers in results paragraph , there are multiple questions using similar tone . 
  just use condoms , you will be fine . 
  read carefully through * or * skip to survey results at the bottom of the page , last paragraph . 
  original sentence said `` almost half '' , so i used 50 % , but precise number is 45 %, 
  * a study for amnesty czech : czech people have no clue about violence and rape of women . 
  * mildly drunk attractive woman is returning home , passing through park . 
  just few meters away , there 's a rapist waiting in bush , young defenseless woman is easy target . 
  according to the most people , this is how typical rape begins . 
  over 7500 women are raped in cz annually , but only 2 % of rapist are punished . 
  when asked , people thought there are only couple hundreds of cases and that 50 % if offenders are punished . 
  most people in survey also thinks that offender is mostly some random unknown person who chooses his target randomly , however , opposite is actually true . 
  survey also asked if people think woman is co-responsible for her rape . 
  `` yes '' said one third of respondents and half of men . 
  the biggest approval of co-responsibility were men in age of 18-34 , ironically group of men responsible for the most rape . 
  results show that most of citizen have very skewed ideas about rape . 
  9/10 victims of sex violence wo n't even report . 
  prejudice against women is a major factor - women think that if they were raped by her partner or friend , police would not bother with their case . 
  they often fear that other people would look at them as co-responsible and say they were asking for it , so they rather choose to live traumatized without contacting police or looking for professional help . 
  ** you can use this thread to discuss violence against women in europe in general , there 's a lot of diversity in europe , it will be good to hear your opinions . 
   i do n't consider people in adidas , lacoste shoes and with selfies sticks for their iphones as `` refugees '' , sorry . 
  it 's funny because it 's true, 
   mandatory islamization so edgy, 
  not gon na happen , sorry , majority is not against , plus there would be economic consequences . 
  remeber the money we got for development ? 
  there you go . 
  he 's full of shit , obviously . 
  cz showing its eastern european roots and fact that eu project is somewhat alien to them . 
  i mean , we 're not talking about 20 or 50k refugees , this is couple thousands to help alleviate crysis in other flooded countries taking all the burden . 
  shame . 
  that 's a single source of that information and is not very convincing to be honest . 
  how so ? 
  that 's actually correct . 
  rally of anti islam , anti immigrantion anti minorities , most of them holding racist , homophobic and even anti semitic views and good chunk of them would agree to kill immigrants in cold blood . 
  i love how they claim that they 're the voice of nation just because they have 150k likes on fb . 
  i 'm glad there was a counter protest . 
  * edit : oh , facts bother you ? 
  wo n't change the fact that they 're in the list of top extremist organizations by czech national security agency . 
  if you look up any post on their fb , there will be comments justifying murder of muslims/immigrants and much more *, 
  yes , that sounds very just from the position of privilege , congrats . 
  thing is , they went to uk legally , legally work there and are still facing anti slavic prejudices from far right and populists . 
  what you 're saying is that you would just send proper hard working citizen home , because you do n't want to look like hypocrite and that 's pretty selfish . 
   blacks seven times more likely to be in british prisons than whites so brave , lol . 
   deport them all . 
  glad you 're not holding executive power now . 
  this is obviously shit , these kid were spoon fed nonsense like this from parents , but let 's not pretend that the rest of society do n't have any problems . 
  you also saw one or two people speaking for whole class there , that 's not very telling . 
  you would get a lot of retarded answers if you ask other people or even kids about minorities , homosexuality , women 's rights , especially in eastern europe , shit , people here even claim there was no roma holocaust in ww2 . 
  there 's no excuse for prejudice like this , unfortunately , this is n't only muslim problem . 
  besides , muslims in germany are very moderate , recent poll concluded that 60 % muslims in germany are n't against gay marriage . 
  how dare they !, 
  wait a second , you 're one `` thinking with a brain '' ? 
  the fuck you talking about ? 
  you 're just paranoid tool thinking there 's some leftie big brother watching the news , but truth is , that 's just human decency , something you 're probably lacking . 
  yes that makes whole lot of sense , thanks for contributing to the discussion .

  * for starters the problem is more the sheer number of the refugees than anything else . 
  * https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3jzudv/lesbos_on_verge_of_explosion_as_refugees_crowd/cutqlmd * i got back from lesvos yesterday . 
  toured all the camps and also went to the north and saw people landing . 
  it 's absolutely horrific . 
  there are newborn babies sleeping on nothing but cardboard .

  cool story bro . 
  we have been sending troops alright , did n't seem to help . 
  this humanitarian crisis was ignored for way too long and this is the consequence . 
  how the fuck you want to help people in syria if they 're attacked by their own government ? 
  that 's where you 're wrong , due to sheer amount of people greece ca n't do shit at the moment and local people suffer from this . 
  it will get better soon , once they leave , like most of them plan to do . 
  but again , you 're underestimating the situation and not really helping by calling everyone fucking savages or some spoiled hipster nomads . 
  well , you 're not going to let yourself starve on street , will you ? 
  this is basic survival . 
  i wrongly assumed that these people are coming without any money , though . 
  there are kids being born on fucking cardbord boxes , there are going to be problems due to sheer amount of people accumulated recently , if you expect to everyone to remain calm you 're underestimating the situation . 
  might be something with your attitude , but idk , i might be a gipsy so do n't listen to me . 
   you will pay for them with your taxes . 
  that 's what taxes are for , i 'm okay with that . 
   your daughter/sister/girlfriend will have to walk every day through group of bored young men , who have 0 respect for women . 
  they are already walking by people like you , nothing worse can happen . 
  yea , i have no idea what the fuck is going on .

  corrupted , opportunistic , populist asshole - yeah sure . 
  but not some neo-nazi far right radical . 
   i 'm worried about the political goals and social measures of some ee thanks for being so concerned about us , but maybe you should be more concerned about fpo in austria , le pen in france , pvv in netherlands , trump in the us , afd in germany or brexiteers in the uk . 
  are you also sceptical of austria 's , france 's or netherlands ' eu membership ? 
   that 's spot on and exactly a problem for poland since its inception - especially if german and russian interests align  i totally understand that  i 'm personally with poland on this . 
  imo the potentional political consequences of this project are not worth the benefits that we ( as cz ) might gain . 
  but as i said , i also understand germany 's position , they just follow their interests , just like poland does . 
  i understand poland 's position ( and thanks for pointing out the thing about your coal dependancy , i did n't really realize that and it makes poland 's position even more understandable ) . 
  on the other hand , i also understand germany 's position . 
  they want cheaper gas and more secure lines that could avoid ukrainian territory . 
  it just so happens that germany 's and poland 's interests go directly against each other in this situation . 
  it will be interesting to see what eu decides on eventually . 
   i would argue that the stability in ukraine is mainly threatened by the proxy invasion , by corruption , an economic crisis , unemployment and political instability in general rather than the gas problems , but you certainly got a point . 
  this is all connected though . 
  if you do n't have money , then you also lack the tools that could help you solve your other problems . 
  how is ukraine supposed to fight russian-supported separatists if they go bankrupt ? 
  it 's pretty hard to ensure political stability , if you do n't have economic stability . 
   it seemed to me that this is usually done by forming internal blocks in the eu and then exercising pressure on other countries/blocs . 
  involving the eu itself as a vehicle is n't that common . 
  honestly i do n't see what your problem with that is . 
  this is a really important issue for poland , it 's about their energy security , they are also very sensitive about anything that has to do with russia . 
  of course they 're going to use all the tools they have available to protect their interests . 
  any other country in their position would do so . 
  germany is doing exactly the same thing - protecting their interests too , maybe you 're not so loud about it , but the intentions are pretty much the same . 
  i think you 're just a bit biased towards poland ( no offense , i mean , we all have our little biases and prejudices ) , so you 're looking at their actions more critically , when in fact , they 're acting pretty understandably ( just like germany 's stance is understandable ) given the circumstances . 
  this issue touches the very national interests of both poland and germany , so of course `` solidarity '' does n't mean much . 
  the same thing has been happening with the migrant crisis , both when western europe did n't want to help out italy before 2015 and nowadays when ee does n't want to help out we . 
  people should really stop getting outraged over the lack of solidarity . 
  in 99 % cases there is just no such thing when core national interests are involved , both in the case of we and ee . 
   proxy war or not , what matters in the end is that there will be ukrainian households that do not have enough gas to heat their homes . 
  oh , let 's get real , this was never about ukrainian households . 
  it was never about the well-being of ukrainian people or well-being of ukraine as a country in general . 
  when cee politicians are now using ukraine as an argument , they do n't really think about people of ukraine , they are concerned about the stability and the balance of power in the eastern european region . 
  you 're right that russia-ukraine gas feuds were here before , but since 2014 , the geopolitical conditions changed , you ca n't deny that . 
  it makes much more sense to worry about ukranian stability and russian influence in the region now that it did before 2014 . 
  i 'm not saying there were no reasons to be worried before 2014 , but they were much smaller . 
  before 2014 , what was mainly at stake was just the well being of ukraine . 
  whereas today , the political consequences of weak and destabilized ukraine and stronger russia affect us as well . 
  so , yes , i agree with you that v4 arguments about ukraine are not as altruistic as they might seem , however that does n't mean that the geopolitical concerns are not real . 
   it however is not a valid argument in my opinion . 
  it is natural that this would upset poland , but it does not justify seeking help from the eu in stopping the project . 
  i think that poland has every right to look for allies when protecting their interests , including the eu , that does n't obviously mean that the eu is obliged support poland . 
  and come on , i 'm pretty sure germany will also try to pull the strings in the eu to get the commission on your side and germany 's motivation for that will also be mainly , if not purely , financial . 
  all countries are doing this , so i see absolutely no problem with poland doing it . 
   as i have said time and time again in this regard : none of the v4 had these concerns with south stream despite it having exactly the same effect on ukraine . 
  correct me if i 'm wrong but have n't the first debates about south stream taken place before the whole crisis in ukraine escalated into war ? 
  because if so , those are some very different geopolitical conditions and you ca n't really compare these two situations . 
  and then in 2014 when the situation in ukraine got tensed , the whole south stream project was already sort of slowly dying anyway , so there was no need to loudly oppose it . 
   i would argue that transit fees are an argument to oppose it for poland no matter what . 
  oh yeah , definitely , i was not trying to say otherwise , of course poland is also concerned about their own transit money , but that 's quite understandable , any country would be concerned about that . 
   would you say that the opposition is mainly driven by solidarity with poland rather than solidarity with ukraine or rational concerns ? 
  i 'm not sure , i do n't see in the heads of our officals , but i would definitely say there 's some pressure on us from v4 , not just poland , but also slovaks , who we 're politically close with , so we tend to stick with them . 
  the ukraine argument is often publicaly used by our officials and for sure plays some role . 
  as i said , weak ukraine is rationally not so good for us . 
  although i 'm not sure how important that really is . 
  we 're definitely hesitant about the whole thing and i would not be surprised if we adopted a neutral position eventually . 
  i remember that in november 2015 cee countries sent a letter to the commission protesting about the nord stream and we did n't join this initiative . 
  then in december we apparently talked it through with slovaks and decided to join the opposition . 
   they simply are afraid of being cut off by russia/rising gas prices/loss of transit fees . 
  why do they need to make bullshit excuses to opppose the project ? 
  what do you mean , the statement of duda that you quoted basically says the exact same thing that you said that they 're afraid of , just in different words . 
  circumventing poland = being cut off by russia efficiency and competitiveness with regard to gas supplies = having to pay more for gas . 
  the only thing that duda does n't openly mention are the transit fees . 
  but even the transit fees are not purely a financial concern , since the country that is going to be the most fucked by this is not poland or any other v4 country , but ukraine . 
  ukraine already is in deep shit financially , they really need the transit money , not having it would financially ( and also politically ) significantly weaken the country . 
  weak and unstable ukraine is really not good for our region , or just for eu in general . 
  for example my country still reluctantly opposes the project , despite projections saying that we would financially benefit from it ( since one of the routes would go from germany through us to slovakia/austria and further south to italy ) . 
  it 's a fun discussion to read though . 
  a : the system wo n't work . 
  b : the system would work , if we could enforce it .

  b : but if we enforced it , it would be the best and fairest system . 
  a : but it 's not possible to enforce it . 
  c : i think you guys are trapped in a circle here . 
   cant really get what czechs see on babis . 
  i do n't vote for him , however i can see why other people do . 
  1 . people are simply fed up with traditional parties and ano still manages to keep the anti-establishment image despite being in the government for three years . 
  2 . ano does n't have any ideology whatsoever , so they can catch both right wing and left wing voters . 
  there are surveys saying that they have voters among former communist voters and former ods/top 09 voters . 
  and i 'm not really that surprised , since babi\u0161 , as the finance minister , is rather fiscally conservative , which can appeal to right-wing voters , while at the same time , the economy is doing well , so he does n't need to restrict any social benefits/state salaries . 
  he can actually afford to raise the minimum wage , raise the salaries of medical workers and teachers , which can appeal to the left wing voters . 
  at the same time , having no ideology means that they have basically no core voters . 
  so the moment the economy worsens and he can no longer appease both right wing and left wing voters , or the moment a serious scandal appears , so he can no longer be seen as anti-corruption , he will loose the voters quickly . 
  3 . not all of the people in ano are actually bad politicians by default . 
  ano mps are also among the ones who support the reconstruction of state anti-corruption laws the most . 
  anyway , i agree that it 's likely that he 's going to win , but i would not be 100 % sure about that . 
  as i said , it 's still a year ahead of us , a lot can happen . 
  and even if he does win , it does n't guarantee that he 's going to form a government . 
  in terms of v4/eu orientation , it does n't change anything for now . 
  these were just regional elections and the regional councils have no power over foreign policy . 
  the current government has a mandate until autumn 2017 . 
  so that means a whole year is still ahead of us until the next general elections , a lot can happen in that time , it 's really too soon to predict any results . 
  yes , absolutely , basically all mainstream parties are against immigration from mena . 
  this is because it 's also the mainstream opinion of the population , so the political parties reflect on that . 
  however we also have parties which combine this stance with an anti-eu sentiment and which advocate leaving the eu alltogether and these luckily did n't get a lot of votes . 
  well ha\u0161ek seems like he 's pretty much done for now . 
  or at least seriously weakened . 
  but i get your point , \u010cssd really is split into these two sections and i think it 's actually one of the reasons why they did so poorly in these elections .

  a lot . 
  they get a lot of hate though , especially the second one . 
  comments on their facebook page are 90 % hate comments , especially under articles that reveal hoaxes about muslims . 
  `` it ai n't true but it might be ! '', 
  `` this may be a 5 year old report based on a crime done by an older white man , but a group of muslim youths totally could 've done it too ! '', 
  `` you 're the reason we 'll end up under sharia law ! '',

  [ that 's my beach ] ( http://hungarytoday.hu/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/angela-merkel.jpg ), 
  one of the recently discussed problems is that our country ( and some other eastern european countries ) is treated by many corporations as a `` dumpster of europe '' when it comes to food and other consumer products . 
  the same brand of a product can have different amount of ingredients from the same product sold in germany and sometimes can even cost more . 
  this means that if you live close to the german or austrian border you have access to better and cheaper products than the rest of the country . 
  the companies argue that if the consumers keep buying the products then it is ok but the reason people keep buying these products is because they 're still the most affordable ones . 
  edit : i just realized i ranted about an unrelated topic ... 
   we basically get western european prices , but 2-3 times less wages this is one of the biggest issues we currently face . 
  so many other problems are caused by this . 
  i am 22 and i personally do n't know anyone who never illegally downloads or thinks it 's wrong . 
  the absolute majority of people my age will laugh at you if you say piracy is an issue and the absolute majority of older people do n't understand the problem at all so they have no issue with it neither .

  nazis are still being hunted these days even though they are too old to go to prison . 
  that happened over 70 years ago too . 
  i know we would n't be able to identify who participated in the lynch mobs but the least we could do would be to return what was stolen . 
  edit : also i read we put tens out thousands of them in work camps , some of them located at former nazi camps . 
  some of the germans were released as late as 1955 ...

  this rally also had very restricted access . 
  the police checked people and if it seemed someone could have different opinion than president they did n't allowed them in . 
  most students did n't pass police 's criteria and were n't allowed there - which is funny , because this day should be about celebrating students bravery and sacrifice , both in 1939 and 1989 . 
  so current israel 's situation is a success ? 
  islamic state 's leaders believe they are on course for an apocalyptic battle with their enemies , from which they will emerge victorious . 
  they foretell `` that the armies of rome [ usually interpreted as any christian or non-islamic force ] will mass to meet the armies of islam in northern syria ; and that islam 's final showdown with an anti-messiah will occur in jerusalem after a period of renewed islamic conquest . '', 
  as such , islamic state supporters actively welcome the prospect of western intervention , which they believe will hasten their own final victory .

  except for us czechs , we have jack shit . 
  i believe him . 
  i did n't see any of those pictures about merkel while i saw this one about greeks . 
  maybe because this one got upvoted and the others did n't ? 
  it 's easy , everything in this thread is sarcasm ... 
  even this . 
  then skoda is ok  just not sk\u00f4da , we do n't even use the letter ( '' \u00f4 '' ) .

  can i ask why this is considered low quality content ? 
  yesterday i did n't know there were so many monarchies in europe , today i know thanks to this post . 
  so i do n't understand what about it is low quality . 
  the whole `` highest something something '' . 
  the highest unemployment rate in the czech republic was in 2005 ( almost 10 % ) . 
  the highest public debt to gdp ratio was in 2014 ( 45 % ) . 
  so i do n't understand what exactly you mean by those two columns . 
  i think you just do n't understand the table . 
  neither do i though :(, 
  you could pay off the debt while you are there . 
  it 's not like $ 400 billion would do much to your $ 16 trillion debt anyway :p, 
  population of eu only 66 million ? 
  more like 503 million . 
  yeah , i get it ... not bad , 
  the temperature is so high that a czech weather website ca n't deal with it . 
  look at this picture : http://i.imgur.com/yumkbem.png the really bright pink ( or almost violet ) is 36 degrees . 
  but when you look at the top left corner , you can see a weird black and white anomaly . 
  that is not even in the legend , the programers probably did n't think it would ever get over 36 degrees :d, 
  i am glad our government introduced a debt limit of 55 % of gdp . 
  looking at pretty much every western european country is just depressing . 
  could you create the map with these data ? 
  and maybe create another topic with it ? 
  really ? 
  `` nai '' means `` yes '' ? 
  i was thinking it 's a `` no '' the whole day ... how do you say `` no '' in greek then ? 
  why is ron paul in the train ? 
  oh , yes , you are right , i did n't read the full quote ( because i remembered the quote and then just looked up a source where it appears ) . 
  still , the question is how the public reacts to this . 
  it already appears a lot of greeks are withdrawing money from atms . 
  it 's interesting how there is a clear distinction between west and east with us in the middle of it . 
  but lagarde said :  `` if on july 1st it 's not paid , it 's not paid , '' http://greece.greekreporter.com/2015/06/18/imf-chief-no-grace-period-for-greece-if-it-misses-payment/ also , the question is how the other creditors react to it . 
  and how the public . 
  but troika did n't fuck greece up . 
   they told as that in 2 years we will start growing and they failed twice already with their predictions and everytime they were taking more and more austerity measures . 
  yes , they fucked that up . 
  but it was the deal , was n't it . 
  you accepted it , you should have known there were risks . 
  they did n't destroy your economy , it was already destroyed by your government . 
  they tried to fix it and it did n't work . 
  i know you are probably pissed off because the situation in your country is really bad . 
  but you should blame the generation of people that supported the government that got you into this . 
  the problem is that the union ca n't take care of irresponsible children . 
  the union does n't have control over fiscal policy of national governments so the governments can choose to abuse their position in the union . 
  if your child does drugs , you ca n't always fix it . 
  troika tried , it did n't work . 
  you must realise that it is n't their responsibility to help , it 's their money , they can do with them whatever they please . 
  yes , a big reason why they tried to help was because of european banks . 
  but that is understandable , they did n't want them to fail , because that would be bad for eu/ez . 
  still , it 's not their fault , greece fucked up , troika tried to fix it , it did n't work . 
  why should troika be blamed ? 
  if someone is to be blamed , it 's greece . 
  oh , thank god ^ ( who i do n't believe in , but still ... ) , 
  i suppose they did ? 
  they tried to help , did n't they ? 
  could n't agree more . 
  made me so mad too , i just thought this sub was better than that :( i hope / u/dclauzel wo n't stop writing in both languages . 
  you want the ez and eu to suffer another recession ?

  maybe it can help someone learn another language ? 
  maybe it can help the author to learn translating ? 
  maybe it can help author 's comments not to be misunderstood ? 
  maybe it is artistic ? 
  the last idea might sound amusing , but that is actually the reason why i like it . 
  when you look at the literature , you can see that a lot of writers chose to write very artistically not always trying to make it easy on the reader . 
  they did it because they liked it , or maybe they found it hard to convey their ideas just by mundane words . 
  i like it because it paints this subreddit in a different colour than the others . 
  i like it because it shows how diverse european culture is . 
  i like it because it demonstrates how users are willing to do something differently . 
  and i do n't even know french . 
  still like it . 
   but this really is n't the place or the format . 
  it is if we want it . 
  or put mildly , if we do n't * not * want it . 
  i understand it can be jarring for someone . 
  the thing is that they are his comments and he decided to be a little , let 's say , artistic about it . 
  it is at his own risk that people might decide to skip his comments . 
  i do n't know why we should be mad at him for that . 
  i like how it makes this subreddit a bit more different than the others . 
  but this is n't about language , not per se . 
  this is about how good ideas are conceived and how they are allowed to grow . 
  / u/dclauzel wants to write in french and english on a european subreddit . 
  that is his idea . 
  maybe it 's a great idea , how can we ever tell if we forbid it ? . 
   what delusions . 
  do you think you 're 1 of 10 people on the planet ? 
  so we live in a world build by aliens ? 
   diversity in languages is certainly not . 
  you misunderstood my comment . 
  diversity allows for competition of different ideas . 
  if we disallow diversity , we will drive good ideas away .

  between 1568-1571 they killed 59 people , mostly merchants . 
  near m\u011bln\u00edk they killed three pregnant women , cut out their fetuses and took from them ( from these fetuses ) hearts , lungs and livers , which they ate , for they believed it will give them courage . 
  eventually they were captured . 
  roh\u00e1\u010d was sentenced to death by gradual cutting his fingers , then executioner teared parts of his body out , then his bones were broken by breaking wheel and finally he was left do die from his injuries .

  he is also big supporter of vladimir putin .

  the reason for the current restitution is that the catholic church ( and the other churches ) should financed itself and not be paid by the state .

   he made a crowd scream they want less marrocans ok , i might be wrong , but that 's still not on the same level as hitler . 
   you realise the vast vast majority if muslims people like geert wilders target are often 3rd or even 4th generation ? 
  the jews were in europe for 50 + generations , literally since before christianity even appeared . 
  it 's not a fair comparison . 
  likewise gypsies have been in europe for 1500 + years at the time when hitler came to power . 
  besides , most populists currently in power usually want to get rid of the latest waves of immigration and shut down family immigration routes from `` problematic '' countries . 
  few want to deport the 3rd and 4th generation immigrants . 
   they will quickly discover you cant `` send '' immigrants back if their native country doesnt accept them best case scenario they implement hardcore sanctions against those countries to force their hand . 
  worst case scenario they invade those countries for a small enough of time until the immigrants can be deported back home . 
  nobody would start building concentration camps , just like nobody burns people at the cross for being a witch these days . 
  hitler wanted to `` make germany great again '' by taking over a few regions that `` rightfully '' belong to germany . 
  the only leader in europe that 's proposing ( or , well , implementing ) that nowadays is putin and i would n't say russian aggression is a new thing . 
  he wanted to deport all jews from germany initially , however the issue was that they were pretty much native europeans and germany was their true homeland . 
  this is in strong contrast with european populists who merely want to return syrians to syria , afghans to afghanistan , moroccans to morocco , etc. 
   aaand they dropped their most popular issues in which finns voted for them ; immigration and refugee crisis i 'm not sure why you do n't believe a right-wing party would necessarily drop immigration once they 're in power . 
  it 's not like the `` refugees '' have a strong corporate lobby that prevents harsher laws from being passed . 
  other issues ( e.g. 
  leaving the eu ) are harder to implement though , i agree . 
  none of the modern populist parties propose anything close to what hitler did . 
  the pope is a lying piece of shit , just like all of the world 's religious leaders .

  sorry , i meant the holy roman empire , which later transformed into the austrian kingdom .

  explain zeman 's victory in 2013 then . 
   yes slovakia is a new country , we are not . 
  czechia is also a new country ( last time they were independent was 700 years ago ) . 
  considering the fact that czechs have elected a permanently semi-drunk trump of their own ( zeman ) , you should n't be surprised . 
  well , when was slovakia named `` slovakia '' before 1992 ? 
  by your logic it 's also a `` strange word '' . 
  trump has been to czech republic ( czechoslovakia ) numerous times and two of his children speak czech thanks to their czech mother . 
  wtf are you talking about ? 
  the guy is extremely popular in the country . 
  but is razem a populist party or is it not ? 
  populist = appealing to the people , right ?

   i do n't even remember the last time bangladesh was not being run by a women . 
  and what are czechs supposed to do - create quotas for women in the government ? 
  there are n't any real barriers towards becoming the czech president or pm for women , it 's just that politics is less interesting for them here . 
  bangladesh , a muslim country where the majority of the population lives below poverty , is leading czech republic in the gender gap ?!, 
  i 'm sorry but that 's just laughable . 
  i assume it comes from a subjective bias where western countries are judged more harshly and/or have better/unfalsified statistics .

  whether or not we can build an ai that wo n't destroy the whole planet is an open question . 
  whether or not we should * care * about potentially `` killing '' a full ai is not : it 's irrelevant . 
  my point is n't about a strong ai . 
  my point is that moral dilemma 's should in no way be applied to discussions of any kind of ai . 
  in the case of tesla we can simply remember that the trolley problem has a 1 in a million chance of happening and discard it . 
  in the case of strong ai we can simply say we do n't give a shit about `` robot rights '' and add a shut-off button . 
  obviously the risk of being destroyed by a powerful-enough ai is a million times more important than moral qualms about shutting off a computer . 
   however , there will be ethical implications in the long run with regard to strong ai this argument reminds of the retarded trolley problem applied to self-driving cars : `` b-but ... what if my tesla has to choose between killing a schoolbus full of children and killing myself ?! '' . 
  forget about it . 
  there 's no moral dilemma . 
  plug off the computer and be over with it . 
  arguing over retarded philosophical ideas is literally the worst way of approaching real-life problems . 
  the v4 countries agree to offer help , as long as the refugees stay outside of europe . 
   from dictators which grants no rights to the people while saudi arabia is in fact an absolute monarchy , you have to remember that : 1 ) their * citizens * have a higher median income than many european countries and get a lot of welfare . 
  do n't confuse the * citizens * with the temporary workers which would n't have had any voting rights even if it was a democracy . 
  2 ) they never had a democracy in the first place , so it 's not like their royal family overthrew a previously elected government and seized power . 
  they were always a monarchy so i 'm not sure if we can be imposing democracy on them . 
   if the western world was indeed serious about human rights and democracy they 're not and they never were . 
  at least by now we 're finally starting to embrace it rather than outright lying about our intentions . 
  the west does care a lot about the rights of their own citizens , but never cared much about non-allied countries . 
   you ca n't bring any alcohol from russia unless you stay there for over 20 hours shit , i guess i 'm not the first to think of the idea ... 
  i guess getting drunk in russia itself is the only easy option then . 
  do n't people living in the border area get a different kind of visa though ? 
  similar to how st. petersburg residents get a simplified schengen visa ? 
  information asymmetry is only important if the consumers care about said information . 
  but here 's the thing : they do n't . 
  they did n't give a shit before the cookie law , they did n't while it 's in effect , and they wo n't when it 's gone .

yep , you are correct . 
  thats why hungary is doing the aplication process on borders . 
  they builded fence and only through checkpoints , you can apply for assylum . 
  since imigrants dont need asylum , but money , they avoid hungary a go to germany . 
  well , even if they fail in request for asylum elswhere , they can try it again in germany . 
  ye , depends what you call socialist . 
  from my point of view , it is . 
  1 ) refugees want to be saved by rich countries like germany or sweden , they run away to not receive asylum in hungary . 
  hungary can not catch all of them and force them to apply for asylum . 
  and there is no punishment for asylum seekers , which break the agreement , that they register in first eu country . 
  they dont give a fuck about rules in eu . 
  2 ) even if they register them , they have no right to hold them in hungary more than 30 days . 
  it is partly due to political mindset of hungary government . 
  i suppose . 
  they just dont want any illegal migrants in hungary . 
  what they are doing , is the only correct thing . 
  they stop all immigrants , register them and let them fill request for asylum . 
  of course , immigrants dont want to apply for asylum , because they would have not as much money as in germany , so they need to bypass hungary or cross it , but run from police . 
  and hungary knows , that immigrants want to be saved by rich country , not poor . 
  i think they do . 
  europe is lead mainly by socialist , and all of the migrants are new voters of socialist . 
  and cheap working force for jobs we don \u00b4 t want to do . 
  basically , hungary is the only nation respecting the law . 
  others don \u00b4 t give a shit . 
  if they let them pass without any document and control , they break the law . 
  normally , they should defend the borders . 
  and , if they just pass all migrants to austria , you will see how soon austria will freak out and close the borders . 
  well , i worked in automotive industry , and you would be surprised , what things people never find out . 
  i spend 2 weeks in israel , this summer , and it was awesome . 
  jerusalem is specific , but in tel aviv , when i mentioned that i am from czech republic , everyone was so kind to me , incredible . 
  we like to think of ourself as central europe . 
  but usually , people divide europe to east and west , so we are marked as eastern , even though we don \u00b4 t feel like that and even geographically , it does \u00b4 n make much sense . 
  plus , you are right with numbers before/after wwii . 
  just dont forget , that we are one of the biggest allies of israel , so jewish people really like to be here and we like them here . 
  don \u00b4 t you have some link to this story , you mentioned ? 
  thx, 
  thats not really true . 
  if you count czech republic as eastern europe , than we have quite strong jew community in prague . 
  it is linked to our history . 
  if you look on the data from switzerland for example , only 12,5 % is working , so work approval is not really an issue for them . 
  haha , i can \u00b4 t wait for the moment , when some migrants will be moved to czech republic , bulgaria or whatever country different than germany and sweden  ) ) they will be pissed on mama merkel and they will rush in germany once again , cause we have no borders in eu and as we can see now , migrants don \u00b4 t have to respect any laws or rules . 
  thank you very much for the info !, 
  oh come on , you really believe , they will sort them out , and eventually deport back ? 
  maybe you missed it , but even those , who got refused as refugees , just stay in europe , because no one is moving them anywhere ... 
  i am really looking forward to see the poor ones , which will be chosen to live in czech republic . 
  germans will have them back in 24hours , if they dont watch borders . 
  well , once you pass the borders of european union and you run from police , to not be registered as a refugee , because you want to be registered in some wealthier country , then you really are not a real refugee , just scumbag . 
  well , the definition is here , but it is not respected , 
  may i ask you i which field you were working ? 
  i am generally interested in expat work in middle east ( maybe not now , with the situation there ) and i would be interested in your story , how you got there etc. 
  i am working in train industry and was working in automotive before . 
  my only theory is , that if you look at demographic structure of german population , the are really in deep shit , regarding working class , especially young working class . 
  maybe , the reasoning behind this behavior is just political . 
  thanks for info !, 
   i never really liked the area and last time i spoke with my french friends , they really discouraged me from getting accomodation anywhere near saint denis ... 
  well , maybe now i won \u00b4 t have to explain , why saint denis is not a good place to visit ... 
  as far as i didn \u00b4 t like sobotka after the election , he is doing ok , during this crisis . 
  my expectations were much lower . 
  i should have clarified , that i was talking mainly about middle east immigrants . 
  with africa , i don \u00b4 t think the results will be much different , because ( as you can already see in france ) they can find jobs in africa , but in europe , they are pretty much unemployable , due to language barriers , different working enviroment and due to education from africa not being recognized in europe . 
  exactly . 
  plus , the education level seems to be really poor . 
  at least from what i have seen so far . 
  unfortunatelly , we are not so classy . 
  wish i could be british and sip my tea right now ... 
  thank you !, 
  i just started to read some books on old greece and rome empire ( why i didn \u00b4 t listen in school ? 
  ) , so this will be usefull !, 
  well that 's already the case , we are sucking funds from eu for bullshit projects that would never happen with normal funding . 
  but as long as they pay we have to take everything , before they realize it , 
  well it 's kinda too late for france i would say, 
  because eu wants to control as much money and power as possible , and this is against it ... 
  and hopefully they will, 
  well no one should force them in the first place, 
  ye , and that 's where our opinions differ , cause i consider less taxes for everyone good . 
  there is no institution as bad at managing money , as eu and governments . 
  causing harm ??? 
  what is blocking any other country to reduce taxes as well ? 
  well then they should say fuck you and do what they want , they are free country in free world, 
  how can you call someone stupid , while not even understanding trumps tweet ?? 
  that 's absolutely true , but imo , it was just pr move , because the baggage that hollande has , is ridiculous . 
  i do n't think france had a good choice in the run off . 
  and le pens best voter base are young people , so the increase cam be really expected . 
  he is clearly new hollande , any french political analyst will tell you this . 
  what no one understands is , why hollande had 4 % in polls and member of is own cabinet actually won . 
  what the actual fuck , collecting taxes on european level ? 
  why they need the urge to push more countries to exit eu ? 
  was brexit not sufficient as a warning ?? 
  lol , macron with that white power gesture , 
  france . 
  but probably some smaller city , as i do think really feel good in paris , should i stay there for a long time . 
  maybe le mans or angers would be fine . 
  well , mostly because in the past , we helped them when they needed it the most , and we supplied them with weapons , as the only country from europe . 
  over the time , we developed good relationship , also because we have a lot of jewish history in prague . 
  and there are almost no arabs here , so they feel safe . 
  we have jewish jokes , but we love them , and consider israel one of our best allies in whole world . 
  this is sad to read, 
  and just behind prague , i would say krakow , vienna and dresden . 
  prague . 
  old city , great atmosphere , great bars , pubs and restaurants , and it is cheap for tourists .

  just an fyi , `` marginally different '' means `` only slightly different '' in english . 
  heh , and my grandfather was a train operator for most of his life . 
  found him !, 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/conductor_ ( rail ) til . 
  wait . 
  train engineer = train driver ??? 
  is n't engineer supposed to do different stuff ? 
  ~ ~ and who the fuck is the conductor then ? 
  i thought conductors drove trains ! ~ ~, 
  i like your style . 
  i think slovenia will fence-up , as will hungary on the croatian border . 
  i just vacationed there . 
  it 's * absolutely * awesome as fuck !, 
  england sucks in comparison !, 
  that 's fucking awesome !, 
  if it 's simply an issue of short term housing , we have no problem helping with that . 
  but you have to take them back after some time ( say in spring ) . 
  after all , you seem to want as much immigration as possible , whereas we do n't want immigration . 
  and the refugees wo n't rebel and start burning things when they 'll know it 's just a short-term housing , and they will be allowed to go to germoney in a few months . 
  and before someone starts arguing for the upteenth fucking time , no , it 's not inherently racist or xenophobic to not want immigration to your country . 
  i think it used to be 2/3 some time ago even . 
  so , yes , much better than before . 
  but i think it should be exactly 0/3 . 
  nope . 
  some of us hope and work for a better life , but do n't feel entitled to it . 
  it 's simply magical !, 
  i ca n't even count how many times i heard that playlist anymore . 
  sea levels rise very very * very * slowly . 
  and to start using previously unused fields is a matter of 1 year . 
  lol , what ? 
  yes !, 
  how did you know ?? 
  germany needs an update : ** problem ** \u2192 force eu countries to take care of problem ( or you cut funding ! ), 
  \u2192 ** solution ** !, 
  hey , hey !, 
  scotland 's awesome as fuck . 
  why ? 
  as a czech , i love it !, 
  well , because this is romania . 
  not really . 
  only fancy carriages for tourists in large cities , that 's it . 
  slight correction : they * demand * a better life because they feel entitled to it . 
  can you link me to the `` popular en france '' youtube list ? 
  well , can you at least provide a source ? 
  i 'm not really sure why czso numbers would be better than a real census . 
  yep . 
  unless there 's a third world war there 's no point talking about `` food security '' . 
  and if there * is * a third world war , we wo n't need food anymore . 
  how big a potato are we talking ? 
  ah , that would totally make sense . 
  true , true . 
  but if you wo n't stop it , it 'll get many times worse . 
  cool !, 
  or , you know , you could stop it . 
  i want to adopt a danish , they 're delicious !, 
  ( and white !, 
  [ i kid , i * kid * ] ), 
  yup . 
  it 's the remaining 60 % you have to worry about . 
  afaik that 's not true anymore ( and has n't been for some time ) . 
  in the current migration wave syrians comprise only 20 % , roughly 40 % are former yugaslavis and the remaining 40 % are indeed afghans , iraquis , eritreans , pakis , etc. 
  source : the bbc article today/yesterday on this sub . 
  you seem to have quite an interest in the czech cinema -- any special reason ? 
  a czech in american exile perhaps ? 
  well , considering that with many you will have to start the education from the elementary school level -- and that is * after * they learn the language sufficiently to be educated in it -- i 'm not sure they 'll have patience for that . 
  and that is if all of them are indeed literate . 
  remember it 's not just syrians that are coming , but africans , afghans , iraqis , etc. 
  since 1/3 of the eu budget are bloody useless farming subsidies , i say -- hey , why not this too ? 
  you guys ca n't agree on anything !, 
  lol . 
  now i really want english subtitles for the whole debate !, 
  anyone know if there are any ? 
  potatoes have a particular sound ? 
  i doubt it . 
  i read that a large percentage of the current refugees are illiterate even . 
  great , so that means they 'll have to pay smugglers twice now . 
  that severely limits the amount of people able to take the journey . 
  long term thinking . 
  it does n't have to . 
  people coming by boat from libya are very few compared to the current wave . 
  because that boat trip is much much more expensive than the short hop to lesbos from turkey . 
  that is extremely interesting !, 
  for those of us who ca n't speak danish ( can anybody ? 
   , could you tell us how it went ? 
  and is it possible to find it subtitled to english ( or french ) ? 
  and that border with serbia is a tiny fraction of the border with bosnia , so i 'm not really sure if they can fence it all . 
  i think slovenia could fence itself off if it wanted though . 
  * she 's really bloody awesome , but i much prefer [ her singing in french ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgac2vgzv-e ) !, 
  here you go , an awesome czech film [ knofl\u00edk\u00e1\u0159i ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0128292/ ) ( = buttoners ) . 
  absolutely the best '' [ 404 page not found ] ( http://kvartirakrasivo.ru/404/index.php ) '' page on the internet . 
  and full of awesome moldavian music !, 
   `` this campaign will bring the different varieties and versatility of the irish potato to a younger generation . '', 
   the campaign will include print and digital advertising using a ` cheeky ' potato character and tasty recipes to show potatoes are ` more than a bit on the side ' . 
   the campaign will kick off with national potato day on friday october 2 . 
  priceless . 
  ehm , czech people living in slovakia are n't exactly migrants . 
  most of these people just decided to remain there when czechoslovakia split . 
  also , the data is clearly wrong , since the largest `` migrant '' group in the czech republic are [ slovaks ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/demographics_of_the_czech_republic#after_wwi ) . 
  so , both !, 
  that supposed oxford dictionary definition of the word `` asian '' .

  it is soviet ak-47 in most cases . 
  germany have twice as many guns per capita as we have btw . 
   environment policies wan na be more specific please ? 
  i have tried to google where is the problem with us . 
  did not find anything . 
  it is fully compliant with european firearms directive . 
  also crime with legally owned firearms is next-to-non-existent in our country . 
   one second they hate everything the eu stands for , and break eu agreements to the left , and right . 
  can you give us few examples beside refugee quota ? 
  jan 6 , 2017 also this is just a clickbait title . 
  looks like mucha, 
  can you remind me , how much czechs living in uk or western europe in general ? 
  why did we left austrian empire , when we had such a nice looking propaganda posters ? 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/foreign_relations_of_liechtenstein something like that , also 1,600 km \u00b2 of land which is 10x liechtenstein, 
  they did not recognized our country till 2009 . 
  not sure if this is the evidence for calling it simply `` staged '' . 
  but definitely cnn is happy to push their own view as much as they can , but fox news is doing the same from opposite direction . 
  if you wan na have unbiased informations , then do n't watch these commercial stations . 
  we all know where is the problem , which ideology is behind those attacks . 
  i understand that goverment and media does not wan na push against islam , it might cause more harm than good also it is not politicaly correct , nobody wan na be portrated as second hitler , because he/she will speak bad against islam . 
  but we have to acknowledge that muslims are very vulnerable to radicalization . 
  most muslims are really good people , i believe that , but they have still allah and quran as main source of ideas and allah and quran can be interpreted in many ways . 
  the whole ideology is realy vulnerable . 
  it is realy complex problem without any easy solution . 
  i think i am realy liberal and open person , but islam in this form is a problem we have to acknowledge . 
  problem is , there can not be any `` update '' of quran . 
  it is like running first version of windows95 in year 2017 . 
  islam lack someone like pope , i think current one is really open and willing to `` update '' christianity into current year , i realy like his approach . 
  he is a really nice guy . 
  too bad he had really bad season , lets hope it will get better . 
  would help if you constantly do not attack at every country around you mr. putin i am against military spending , but at this point russia is threat and we should be capable defending ourselves . 
  the belarus , country which is in europe , but nobody really care and know anything about them . 
  the country lives with its own separate life from others . 
  this is how i see belarus . 
  may 16 , 2017 , 04:46:00 am why you keep posting those old news ? 
  published 4:26 am , tuesday , may 16 , 2017, 
  cameraman : must ... have ... footage ... even ... if ... i. ... die, 
  i might created this topic , but i am also juve fan . 
  lets hope he will have chance next year , he is still good !, 
  32 % is blindly following ? 
  i mean , 32 % is still a lot for person like putin , but i would bet that the number will be similiar in many `` western '' european countries . 
  not really afraid of migrants - as long as they are not from mena . 
  vast majority of czechs are against accepting islam and muslims in any form . 
  importing muslims and accepting islam , is the definition of ruined society and country from czech point of view . 
  this is how i see average czech opinion about this . 
  [ world leaders favourability ratings according to czechs -- june 2016 ] ( https://en.stem.cz/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/word-image-6.png ) a year old data , but it is interesting to see , that merkel was most favourite politician long time here , and becomes least favourite politican in just a 2 years . 
  nobody will directly fight russia for crimea with force , that 's for sure . 
  so it will stay in russia . 
  just me , or does he look like he 's 12 ? 
  yes i read that once too , soviets expected western interference and were ready to give up czechoslovakia without conflict . 
  but it is logical that nobody wants nuclear war for 1 country :(, 
  or just bohemia and be done with it . 
  it was like that for like thousand years and moravians did not cared . 
  just like austria is also only part of austria . 
  also masaryk wrote the memorandum `` independend bohemia '' . 
  we were supposed to be called like this in english language if we did not unite with slovakia . 
  wtf , that cabine look like czech flag . 
  wrong sub ? 
   also should be noted that most muslims havent read the qu ` ran not only i dont believe that most muslims havent read the quran ( you are free to prove me wrong with some good source ) , i also think , that in case you have right , and they havent read that , it makes the things even worse . 
  i had many discussions with muslims , and not even once i had good impression from it . 
  just ask them real questions , not what is the weather . 
  ask them if quran is holy book - if thats revelation from god . 
  every good muslim will tell you it is . 
  then ask them specificaly about those pasages in contradiction . 
  you will not get straight answer for that ever . 
  ask them about gays for example . 
  ask them if allah is above laws . 
  what is `` assimilated '' ? 
  if you read the quran at least once in your life , you will know , that there is like 100 things in contradiction with western laws and values . 
  so much things in quran is left for self interpretation , that even some good muslim is extremely vulnerable for radicalization .

  so basically kazakhstan women 's like to watch czech porn . 
   certain jobs come with certain risks . 
  working in an office and sitting in a chair 40 hours a week is n't good for you either . 
  neither is working in a coal mine . 
  yet people still do these jobs . 
  this is really fucking awful mindset you have . 
  so what ? 
  we should have not protect the people against health complications when we can do it , just because sitting on the chair in office can be bad too ? 
  do you even understand how bad inhalation of smoke is ? 
   no , seriously , how is deciding to work in a smoking pub different than deciding to smoke ? 
  you do n't have to do either , yet people still do . 
  do you agree , that for example people in china should work 16 hours per day in factory too ? 
  nobody forcing them to work there right ? 
  it 's their decision , they can quit if they want . 
  danes ffs , get your shit together . 
  since beer + cigarete in pubs was here almost tradition for decades , we were quite behind in this . 
  apparently we had 102 tons of gold before revolution . 
  but we give 30 tons to slovakia and sold the rest in 1997-99 because some others commodities were better investment . 
  last person on moon was ethnic czech , first person which flyed around the moon was another ethnic czech .

  i dont believe that .

  maybe the guard was a pervert . 
  btw , did you know that in the czech republic some of refugees coming from islamic countries and applying for asylum on the grounds of their homosexuality ( punished by death in their homeland ) have to prove that they are actually homosexual to by granted the asylum ?

  i did n't detect any change in quality of submissions during last days . 
  given usual tranquil and pastoral character of this sub ( `` my country in winter '' , `` my country in summer '' , my country in ... ) i thought that the cattle / kettle posts were mods ' effort to take that to a higher level and shield us from dangers of the outside world . 
  well , i guess that prince charles may be well-informed , but still a layman in terms of climatology . 
  like me and most of you . 
  climate has been a sensitive ( possibly even `` hot '' ) topic in recent years and many people tend to discuss it , but in the end of the day who would like to be lectured physics by a guy who studied anthropology or something like that ? 
  why do you downvote this comment ? 
  what is there to disagree with ? 
  i have always been a right-leaning libertarian so i do n't have any issue with going hard right . 
  and i 've also always opposed opening the outer eu borders and unrestricted immigration , especially from culturally-not-so-compatible countries . 
  overall , i hope that trump and brexit are sign of things to come and that the tide has began to turn . 
  does it still have some military value ? 
  both of that is a cold war technology . 
  i would rather see them both gone and replaced by someone else . 
  especially in hollande 's case i 'm uninterested in anything he might say . 
  this whole policy can be interpreted as indication that tusk and juncker are unprincipled opportunists . 
  i do n't think that it 's anyone 's fault  i guess that the eu directive you 've found may have been adopted on the eu level , but has n't been implemented in the czech law yet - or something like that , who knows . 
  it may be not adopted here yet , i do n't know . 
  difference between individuals and businesses can not play a role because if you buy the sim card anonymously seller does n't know if the buyer is physical or legal entity . 
  that 's definitely not the case in the czech republic , at least not yet - we as a company use approx . 
  20 prepaid sim cards and they all are unregistered and anonymous . 
  ( in this case we use them because of flexibility and costs , not anonymity , but i 'm 100 % sure about this . ), 
   so let 's risk dozens of mass shootings ... yeah , exactly  freedom is n't free and i would quite agree with thomas jefferson on this ( `` the tree of liberty ... '' ) . 
  i respectfully disagree on both points you make - ww1 as relevant analogy and claim that armed population makes no difference in terms of ability to resist potentially oppressive and authoritarian government . 
  * ** ad ww1 ** - soldiers ' morale on both sides was mostly either very high ( at the beginning ) or relatively high ( probably till winter 1917-18 ) and at the height of nationalistic era they wanted to fight for their nations . 
  and all ( or almost all ) relevant political parties on both sides also supported the war - even social-democrats which had been `` internationalist '' prior to the war changed their minds . 
  and when finally morale of troops and civilians crumbled in central powers sometime during 1918 it spelled that end was nigh . 
  two revolutions in russia , breakdown of the austria-hungary empire , revolution in hungary and post-war events in germany that followed could rather be interpreted that as long as armies and population had will and resources to fight they kept on fighting and when they lost them shit suddenly hit the fan in their states - which is basically opposite to your conclusion . 
  * ** ad `` having an armed population is n't helpful '' ** - the relevant scenario is n't an all out war like the us civil war , but retaining control over hostile / rebelling population by oppressive government and ** maintaining order inside own territory in the long run ** . 
  try that in the us and you most probably wo n't succeed - there were even analyses that if the federal government tried something strongly unconstitutional it would n't be able to maintain control and territorial integrity ( due to predicted secession of some states ) . 
  that 's a cool guide you have , but from a different textbook . 
  not being in their shoes i do n't judge their behavior now . 
  and concerning the awards you 're wrong , i assume that you 've probably used machine translation and it might be confusing . 
  list of awards they 've received is included in the section 5 - `` vyznamen\u00e1n\u00ed '' ( = awards ) : https://cs.wikipedia.org/wiki/skupina_brat\u0159%c3%ad_ma\u0161%c3%adn\u016f#vyznamen.c3.a1n.c3.ad i agree that the awards they received were rather mid-level , but they received a military award and a senate award , i.e. 
  not just personal . 
  yeah , i agree , i wrote it from my point of view - ** here in the czech republic we have the most liberal gun laws in europe , gun license including concealed-carry permit are shall-issue ( mandatory after fulfillment of certain requirements ) and there are about 800 thousand guns per population of slightly more than 10 million people ** , most of them for self-defense i.e. 
  typically handguns and revolvers . 
  i personally own 3 guns and shooting at shooting ranges is one of popular recreational sports here . 
  and we 've been under constant pressure by eu via their directives for several last years . 
  we even plan to amend our constitution in a way that would prevent future eu gun-grabbing directives from taking effect ( the amendment was prepared by the ministry of interior and is supported by most of political parties therefore it has reasonable chances of being adopted ) . 
  always better to be armed than not . 
  and if guns are wide-spread it does make a difference ( not case of europe , only the us ) . 
  and btw , in my country a group of several people during communist regime did exactly this ( `` murder some law-enforcers '' , in their case about 6 ) and they are being patted on the back not only by themselves , but by the government as well ( receiving honors ) : https://cs.wikipedia.org/wiki/skupina_brat\u0159%c3%ad_ma\u0161%c3%adn\u016f, 
   across europe , from poland to austria , from italy to sweden , parliaments have been adopting expansive domestic and foreign surveillance legislation in recent months and years . 
  this wave of legislation , pushed by populist agendas and public outrage in the wake of recent terrorist attacks on european soil , is a flagrant disregard to decades of jurisprudence by the ecthr and more recent jurisprudence by cjeu , and it puts in danger privacy protections across the continent . 
  the leaders of germany , france and the uk are setting a dangerous precedent which echoes within the european community and far beyond it : mass surveillance by governments has become the new normal . 
  in a bit wider context it looks to me like this sequence of actions : * open borders , let everyone in disregarding security and utilize the consequences to further the following agenda * expand surveillance and disregard privacy protections ~ ** spy on everyone ** * introduce gun-grabbing legislation / directives ~ ** disarm population ** * expand hate speech laws and introduce anti fake news programs ~ ** restrict freedom of speech and access to information ** lessons learned for me ( as a right-leaning libertarian ) : * vote those responsible for the first point out of office along with everyone else who might have similar inclinations * be careful for your privacy * keep your guns if you own some ( regardless legislation ) * check multiple news sources and be wary of those pushing agenda or suppressing certain types of news * watch out what comes next and based on that possibly consider using encryption and arming yourself, 
  i live in one of the most secular countries in the world , no one in my family including me is a christian ( not even baptized ) and it does n't trouble me at all . 
  i actually really liked the event at least based on few videos that i 've seen . 
  basically a lost decade . 
  in one of the most peaceful periods in history . 
  ... after successful flight over the burmuda triangle, 
   more likely , they found a `` new '' way of ruling and decided they were going to make the empire great `` again '' . 
  not really . 
  the key problem was that the western roman empire lost its ability to defend from barbarian attacks . 
  ( i leave the eastern empire out because you probably do n't refer to it . ), 
  what 's interesting is that although there was a long period of gradual decline ( centuries long ) and there are many analyses describing various economic , demographic and other causes and factors of the decline , when shit hit the fan it was all of a sudden and afterwards things went south really fast ( for era before industrial revolution ) : the beginning of actual disintegration of the western roman empire dates to december 31 , 406 ( or 405 ) when a group of barbarians suddenly took advantage of frozen rhine which was part of northern limes at that time and crossed it into the empire ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/crossing_of_the_rhine ) . 
  such intrusions had happened before and probably nobody initially thought that they had witnessed domino starting to fall . 
  however , the barbarians were never driven back across rhine and they instead sacked and permanently usurped northern part of gaul , caused chaos across most of today 's france , isolated roman britain and indirectly caused its fall too . 
  and from that moment on nothing positive occurred to the western empire - combined with overall weakness , the army basically fell apart and few years afterwards , rome was sacked ( in 410 ad - for the first time after almost 800 hundred years ) . 
  and afterwards , provinces fell one by one , rome was sacked for the second time and finally in 476 ad the western empire was no more . 
  so in 405 ad the empire was weak inside , but still occupied ( almost ) the same territory as during its heyday while few years later it was much smaller and few decades later it was n't at all . 
  i like 2 , 4 , 6 , 7 and 8 more than the others . 
  and i like the winner least . 
  yeah , but still ... damn !, 
  why is juncker still around ? 
   one wonders why the eu still has n't tried sending more money and what should we ask for in return ? 
  i doubt that your points cover the whole topic , but i can not find any counterarguments translated into english right now and do n't have time to translate something myself . 
  therefore , i will reply on more general level - i typically agree with positions of e.g. 
  `` czech firearms rights association '' which is something like very small czech nra ( and several other similar organizations ) . 
  their website is predominantly in czech too , however several of their key positions are translated into english here : http://gunlex.cz/en/ look e.g. 
  here - the original reaction to the directive introduced after bataclan attacks : http://gunlex.cz/en/2231-open-letter-to-gun-rights-supporters-across-europe ( i have supported that ) more detailed description of history of gun-grabbing efforts : http://gunlex.cz/en/2373-who-wants-to-ban-our-firearms-strings-lead-to-geneva i have neither time nor intent nor legal training to study things like eu directives in detail myself even in situations when they ( can ) affect me - that 's unfortunate , but thats 's life . 
  ** therefore in situations like this i usually follow positions of people or organizations i tend to trust . 
  in this case i trust the `` czech firearms rights association '' and other similar and i support their positions . 
  and i totally do not trust ec in this regard and consider them the opponent . 
   you can still have your guns for sports and hunting i own all my guns ( 2 handguns and 1 pump-action shotgun ) for self-defense which is the most common reason why people own guns in the czech republic and one of those covered by the `` shall-issue approach '' ( it means that after fulfilling certain reasonable conditions , you get the gun license and gun permit automatically - it 's mandatory and there 's no clerk to decide whether you need the gun for given reason or not ; you said so and that 's enough ) . 
  there are between 800-900 thousands of guns in the czech republic ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gun_laws_in_the_czech_republic#categories_of_licenses ) and almost quarter of a million are for self-defense . 
  gun owners , general population and political representation too are all ok with our current gun laws / status quo and strongly reject any eu directive on this topic . 
  one must understand that ** any effort to ban or restrict certain types of guns or licenses will only cause that affected guns become illegal because many owners including me will declare them stolen or lost ** ( one of my guns actually got stolen in burglary about 10 years ago , i reported that to police and that was all - no fine , no nothing ) . 
  to clarify - the proposed constitution amendment in reality does n't change ( almost ) anything because we already have very liberal gun laws ( we 're the only european nation where gun license is `` shall issue '' ) , reasonable self-defense laws , etc. 
  its main purpose is preventing expected gun-grabbing eu directive ( s ) from taking effect here because if these points are part of the constitution , the eu directives can not override them . 
  otherwise we would have to comply which is something nobody wants , including me . 
  that 's cool , i like that . 
  it depends on how you quantify `` many '' - i guess that there are only few thousands of those `` mulatto czechs '' ** at most ** which i would n't call many at all for a nation with 10.5 million inhabitants . 
  we are still very much ethnically homogeneous country and the minorities are mostly from surrounding european countries ( except vietnamese and in recent years also chinese ) . 
  thanks a lot u/hexalby - this is very well written and interesting . 
  i hope that there will be new installments in the series , after all after `` the empire strikes back '' should follow at least `` return of jedi '' . 
  in case of eastern europe and russia high homicide rates appear to be an indirect legacy of communist era . 
  40 + years of it leave a mark for few generations . 
  in case of the us it 's influenced by racial composition of population there . 
  equivalent of dark ages . 
  i ca n't comprehend how commies still are able to get about 10 + % of vote in most elections . 
  no safe spaces - fighting keeps us fit . 
  and neo marxists . 
  you not only seem to have difficulties to reconcile your opinions with reality , you moreover seem upset right now ( and i must admit that i find it quite amusing ) . 
  you know nothing john snow . 
  i 'm conservative libertarian .

  it is n't really important what other ano members think . 
  babi\u0161 is ano and everyone knows that . 
  ano policies will be whatever babi\u0161 decides . 
  in other words , we 'll end up with a government with even tougher stance on this issue than the current one . 
  obviously i 'm pretty worried about the possibility of okamura 's party getting in the government , on the other hand , it 's probably inevitable that babi\u0161 becomes the next pm anyway , so it will at least be kinda amusing to see him trying to settle this with the commission . 
   about corruption ... would the people of the v4 agree with the mcv ? 
  if this happened back then in 2004 , i 'd be absolutely happy about it and i think the majority of czechs would n't mind either , back then the eu was pretty popular here . 
  nowadays it probably would n't be accepted and frankly i do n't think it would help anymore . 
  we have managed to built at least somewhat functioning network of police and state prosecutors which go after the most obvious cases and hopefully the newly-formed eu public prosecutor will help us with that as well . 
  the problem is that the politicians mostly are n't complete idiots , they get more and more sophisticated , the big fishes are n't doing the primitive kind of corruption - just offering and receiving bribes , they nowadays use much smarter and less obvious methods to gain more power and influence . 
  often these methods are shady , using legal loopholes , so they ca n't even be legally prosecuted . 
  and i do n't think that the eu would be able to help us with something like that . 
   so yeah ... 
  it is n't all honey and milk , but what would the alternative be ? 
  no alternative is better and you can say the same about the v4 too because being in the eea would be the same except you get no say in anything . 
  a full out exit without a trade deal would make v4 crash mostly . 
  you 're richer , but not rich enough and we 'll catch up one day if you do n't pay attention . 
  haha . 
  you 're right , there is n't any viable alternative . 
  that 's why no v4 country is actually interested in leaving the eu , not even hungary . 
   while sometimes discriminatory , a lot of people trust the eu more than they trust our current government because they are a circus . 
  again , i get it , but this is not how it is here . 
  we do n't trust neither the eu , nor our government . 
   on the other hand , why does n't hungary and poland take part in the eppo ? 
  do the people of these countries , who see the corruption , not wonder why ? 
  what would finally make them say `` enough '' ? 
  like i do n't mean to be rude either , but if the people are going to be silent and let the leaders sabotage them , ai n't nobody going to solve their problems for them . 
  there really is n't much they can do . 
  they do n't control their governments and if orb\u00e1n and kaczynski do n't want to join eppo , then the people ca n't force them . 
  the eppo initiative in general is n't some high-profile thing in v4 , hardly anyone even knows about it , let alone what it is about , so we 're back at the problem of the lack of information . 
  frankly poland and hungary would need if someone just imposed eppo over them , just like the eu imposed mcv over you , but that 's not gon na happen . 
   wait ... do i have my info wrong ? 
  i heard hungary was the biggest net receiver ? 
  or maybe per capita ? 
  i do n't remember , i might be wrong . 
  when i said `` we '' i meant the czech republic , not hungary . 
  the czech republic is the closest to the average gdp in the eu out of v4 countries which is what determines how much money you 're allocated . 
  that 's why we 're also the closest ( for now ) to becoming a net-payer . 
   but there 's internet out there and while not everyone has internet , a lot of people do and still prefer to not inform themselves before they form an opinion . 
  without language skills , your options of informing yourself are quite limited . 
  but i agree that many people simply do n't bother at all . 
  but that 's the case in all countries in the world . 
   you also understand that there will be people in other states who will get mad if the v4 get away with this without any consequences ? 
  then those people will be the ones asking `` why do these country get to do that ? '', 
  well the commission has not always been super consistent in enforcing their rules and so far we have all survived that , so i do n't think it would be some massive problem for the eu . 
  but yeah , i get that it might piss some people off . 
  but it 's not something that would destabilize their domestic political scenes or cause them some significant political disruptions . 
  it is a destabilizing factor in our case and obviously i 'm primarely concerned about the political situation in my country . 
   yeah , i know , but even they do n't go as far as to have an anti eu rhetoric . 
  you 're a fresher member state and you need the eu more than hungary , poland or the czech republic do . 
  do n't take this as an insult to romania please , i have lots of respect for your country , but the reality is that you 're poorer and thus in more need of the eu cohesion structure to work well in the future , you are in a more vulnerable geopolitical situation , so you have more to fear from fragmentation of the eu and your population is more eu-friendly partly because the eu has a positive role in romania when it comes to fighting corruption . 
  on the contrary , hungary is n't worried about russia , in fact orb\u00e1n is a good buddy of putin , so he also is n't that worried about two-speed europe . 
  hungary is quite dependent on the eu funds , but they 're hardly seen 100 % positive in hungary , since they 're a massive source of corruption . 
  the reality is that the eu took the ( bad ) experience of helping with corruption in v4 countries and used this experience in romania , so i can see why romanians see it in a positive way , but the same thing never happened here or in hungary or slovakia . 
  we were left alone in this . 
  many people got very disillusioned with politics as a result . 
  in hungary it 's especially prevalent and it 's a big part of orb\u00e1n success . 
  in slovakia , the entire pro-eu establishment parties are corrupted to the bone . 
  so it absolutely is n't that pro-eu = corruption free and anti-eu = corrupt . 
  so i understand why you see the eu as a purely positive force , but you need to understand that this is n't the same everywhere . 
  in my country , the eu never made any significant actions to help us with corruption . 
  we 're also not that far away from net-contributing position at this point , specially since the uk is leaving , so the average gdp in the eu will go down . 
  therefore , the politicians do n't feel such a need to just blindly accept whatever the eu says . 
   if people are uneducated on the matter , it 's hardly eu 's fault . 
  if people were more in touch with how the eu works and what has happened to lead to this whole thing , maybe they would n't be so quick to judge the eu . 
  well , you can say that it is n't the eu 's fault that people do n't understand the eu very well , but that 's what the reality is . 
  and how are they supposed to understand it ? 
  most can hardly speak english , they 're not rich enough to make frequent abroad vacations and in poland and hungary , most medias have some sort of ( left-wing , right-wing ) bias , so the people do n't even have any access to objective news . 
  not to mention , even if the eu managed to explain the people its position better , most would n't change their minds anyway . 
  there 's simply nothing you can say to them which would convince them to agree to muslim refugees coming to our country . 
  they 're scared of islam and that 's it , you can not convince people to accept something they view as a threat to their lifestyle . 
   then it means that the majority of hungarians agree with him ? 
  because i keep hearing hungarians saying that orban 's party is not very popular in hungary . 
  how come ? 
  and if it is popular , why ? 
  the majority ? 
  but sufficient number of hungarians support him for him to win elections with a solid margin . 
  orb\u00e1n has managed to change the electoral system in his favour and what also massively helps him is the incompetence of his opposition . 
  the hungarian left has managed to completely discredit itself because of corruption scandals and general incompetence and orb\u00e1n has managed to seize the opportunity , so now there simply is n't any viable and strong alternative to him . 
  this means that anti-orb\u00e1n people largely remain apathethic and just do n't go to elections at all . 
  i mean , you being from romania ca n't possible be unfamiliar with such a situation , since in your last elections , psd has managed to score , what over 40 % ? 
  because your educated young people mostly did n't show up to vote . 
  and obviously as you mentioned , there 's also jobbik , which is causing orb\u00e1n to take more and more right-wing positions , because he does n't want to lose votes to them . 
  they are for now the most serious threat to him . 
  and then there 's the eu , with their refugee quotas fucking everything up even more , because now even people who would perhaps not vote for orb\u00e1n will say : `` well , he 's the lesser evil , the other pro-eu parties would flood is with muslim immigrants '' . 
  orb\u00e1n does n't really even need to try that hard . 
  he 's a skilled power hungry politician , but even if he was n't that skilled - others are really doing the job for him . 
  i do n't appreciate him as a politician , on the contrary , he 's a fucking disaster for hungarian democratic culture , but that 's no reason to call him a lunatic . 
  a lunatic would be someone that acts completely irrationaly and you ca n't say that about orb\u00e1n . 
  you simply ca n't deny that he has been able to secure a very strong position in hungary and he has been able to keep it . 
  so far , it does n't seem like he 's going to lose it any time soon . 
  he knows what he is doing , he is n't some insane nutjob . 
  orb\u00e1n is n't a lunatic at all . 
  he definitely does n't back down as easily as romanians politicians , but that does n't mean he never backs down . 
  he has just recently backed down a little bit over ceu . 
  in fact , he has been able to get such a dominant position in hungary precisely because he knows when to play hard and when it 's necessary to back down . 
   but others just want votes , power and money at the expense of other people . 
  that 's like the exact description of orb\u00e1n . 
   maybe they slipped through system . 
  yeah , because the system is shit .

  but times are changing and it no longer works that well , still they have time for reforms and are actually going in the right direction . 
  trump is more like america hurting it 's toe and having to slow down than america turning around a walking other way . 
  frisia is really huge , and it had enormous impact on european society and culture . 
  during medieval times frisians lived in pretty democratic societies and were guaranteed their independence and rights by emperor of holy roman empire . 
  makes sense , that 's where anglo-saxons came from . 
  i do that because i resent the guy who introduced the `` czechia '' . 
  seriously , i wish our president would just drink himself to death already , he is pretty close from what i heard . 
  wait , i though most irish did n't speak irish ? 
  according to wiki gealic has just 74,00 native speakers and about 1 500 000 second language speakers . 
  that 's much less than half of population !, 
  well we are poster child for democratic majority atheist country . 
  i mean , most of the other majority atheist countries have `` democratic '' or `` people '' in their name so ... 
  yeah , because we need more of your trolling herr juncker . 
  they both won . 
  i know tax evasion is a problem and i do agree that ireland and others have been acting as eu tax heavens . 
  but i have this feeling that whatever policy eu will adopt under pressure from france and germany will ultimately only benefit , or overwhelmingly benefit , france and germany . 
  because right now , without uk , they are the most important countries in eu by far . 
  lets be honest , which countries in eu can oppose france and germany if they 're united on any issue ? 
  poland ? 
  spain ? 
  italy ? 
  romania ? 
  no other country matches them in population , economic power , contribution to budget or influence . 
  i am proeu but i am afraid that bloc with two overwhelmingly powerful players ca n't work . 
  that 's not even what their saying , they 're just scared that it will apply retroactively . 
  seriously , compared to other stuff happening in europe regarding taxes , this is a nonissue . 
  this also helps their welfare states . 
  in such environment you have to rely on others . 
  idea that you can help yourself is hard sell when it 's -20 outside , you barely see sun and wolves are getting hungry . 
  have you tried : kill all the poor ? 
  [ they chose : `` time to teach them how to war . 
  '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycl0vpbmfww ), 
  except for climate change which will flood coasts , expand deserts and cripple workforce ( heat is a real problem ) and of course boko haram and similar groups that keep operating in the region . 
  nixon did with china , chamberlain did with nazis , roosevelt with stalin , klaus and meciar did with each other when they broke up czechoslovakia . 
  just from top of my head . 
  what kind of goodwill are we talking about ? 
  because i recall that since the very start eu was clear that it will hurt and made clear that trade negotiation will start after uk is out of eu . 
  that is not good will , that is just honesty , good will would be guaranteeing trade deal , or at least territorial integrity . 
  and recently that honesty was replaced with what seem more and more like threats . 
  i was and i am pro-eu but if this trend continues it will no longer be eu , just club for franco-germanic elites . 
  sorry , but no self respecting independent country can accept ceding judiciary to outside entity . 
  this does not look good at all . 
  i 'm getting those clowns confused :d, 
  is he serious ? 
  when was the last time hungary invaded anyone ? 
  or orban had his critics killed , gays jailed or elections rigged ? 
  i know he is an asshole but putting him in same bag as putin is like comparing apples to ... putin oranges !, 
  to be honest czech president does n't have to do as much . 
  his job is mainly representative , american president is on the other hand head of executive branch . 
  we have no idea what zeman would do if he actually had to solve some of our countrys problems instead of just commenting on them . 
  that being said , you are right about both of them being senile . 
  trump and zeman both display tell-tale signs of dementia : increasingly limited vocabulary , confused behavior , reliance on family/inner circle for presentation ( hey ovcacek is basically sessions !, 
  ) , declining oratory skills and last but not least lack of self restraint . 
  what amuses ( scares me ) is that americans essentially elected their version of zeman in 2016 . 
  the vocabulary , gestures , even the damn face and obsession with popularity and general stupidity . 
  god help us all if these two guys ever meet . 
  because i 'm pretty sure that would mean trump getting drunk on slivovice and unlike zeman he has nukes !, 
  same reason trump is/was popular in usa , he 's successful businessman and keeps saying that state should be run like corporation . 
  and people think that 's a great idea . 
  does n't matter that he robbed state blind during privatization or that he was communist state security agent . 
  he is successful therefore he must be the right guy . 
  i 'm not kidding , this is almost exactly what one of his supporters told me . 
  she 's a girl scout . 
  they are often on drugs and/or heavy smokers . 
  in czech republic scouts have long history of political involvement and , as a result , persecution by the government . 
  many units are connected to local churches ( in case of cities that means pretty liberal communities ) and leaders who are n't worried to be political . 
  the one on the right is a girl scout . 
  they wear uniforms like this , i think i even know this girls unit from somewhere , the insignia seems familiar . 
  edit : 30th brno girl unit, 
  turkey and russian is n't black ? 
  i guess few thousand journalists in jail and few dozen dead is n't `` serious '' . 
  nope , and the best part is that we have entire government institute devoted to changing it and making it even harder . 
  for example : did you know that until 50s we spelled museum , gymnasium just like rest of the world . 
  and two centuries before that we spelled \u010d , \u0159 , \u0161 , etc. 
  like polish still do . 
  not to mention our completely unique names for months and bunch of loanwords from russian . 
  all for one purpose , to create language equivalent of sha-2 , that will mark all non-czechs as foreigners no matter for how long they try to learn our language . 
  espionage , everybody does it , everybody hates it , every country needs it and no politician will ever acknowledge it . 
  bastards , making bad situation worse for hundreds of thousands . 
  hey !, 
  you are directly responsible for thousands of dead people every year by doing this , not to mention influx of possible terrorists and rise of domestic far right . 
  if you cared at all you would help in libya , iraq , syria or nigeria not kilometers from shore which the most unfortunate ca n't ever reach !, 
  what ? 
  you got no torches , no giant images of leaders , no jackboots , no drums or horns , no standardized uniforms , no sense of fashion , not even a one shitty `` kill the jews '' banner and you call yourself a nazi ? 
  mediocre ... / s it was reference to joe dirt movie and to how pathetic these people look . 
  i `` love '' how little introspection this sub has . 
  recent news , russian intelligence vessel got sunk by cargo ship sailing under flag of togo full of romanian sheep . 
  for all the bad shit that happened to us under hapsburgs the `` democratic '' twentieth century was much worse . 
  take my great-grandfather , member of czech nationalist organization ( sokol ) , officer of kuk army . 
  his son spend most of the war in gestapo prison and returned half crippled , half of his family barely escaped gas chambers and even that only thanks to `` misplaced '' documents . 
  i ca n't ask him about how he felt about all of this ( he died shortly after communist coup ) but i have a feeling he was not exactly happy with a way our country got fucked up . 
  mighty russian navy everyone !, 
  seriously if not for nuclear bombs the russia would be already gone , almost every time i ask my military friends about russian armed forces they just shake their head . 
  macron is better than le pen , but these comments keep reminding me that comparing people to le pen sets the bar really , really low . 
  i know that he panders to domestic audience , but this is not a way to help eu in the long term . 
  sure nationalists did n't win in netherlands and macron will easily win french election . 
  but let 's not forget that wilders still got more seats than ever before , socialists in netherlands collapsed , macrons own party is barely a year old with basically no presence in parliament and at least third of french voters think le pen is proper leader for their country . 
  not to mention greece still unable to get out of the mess it 's in , turkey turning into new iran and russians undermining democracy left and right . 
  this is not some renaissance of liberal values , at least not in my book . 
  we have soldiers on streets of major cities now and attack almost every month , this is not time for more divisions .

  its like the place for old people , everyone wishes for communism , videogames are evil , like everything you would think an old person says is there . 
  they are like the all-knows of reddit . 
  they are experts on whatever topic is discussed , the thing is most young people will not touch these sites or discussions . 
  on the other hand i disagree with the whole `` information war '' thing , our media are obviously very anti-russian , president gets called out on any negative thing he says that isnt against russia and thats all you see in the news . 
  it 's actually interesting that i always read stuff like this from foreign media and not ours . 
  this acc was created 5 months ago it had only one post up until now . . then he posts the same thing in / r/europe / r/getmotivated / r/country ( music ) and his main point of people being uncivilized is `` they speak their own language instead of english in videogames '' guy probably lost a match in league or cs and decided it would be a great idea to make himself look like a fool on reddit . 
  people are mean to me in videogames =  the whole population is uncivilized, 
  it 's more about making it look less shit , every building can look `` depressing '' if its dirty as fuck . 
  i 've got an idea ...

  that 's ostrava , czech republic . 
  i drink beer the czech way , if i were to drink it the germanic way i would have to limit my consumption by a lot . 
  what i 'm saying is , your source of information should n't be just one . 
  agree with it or not thats how it is , sites are owned by certain parties or people in some cases the goverment itself and for that reason they will always be biased and will try to paint the picture differently or leave out important details . . you like certain publications more than others for that very reason , they are pushing a certain political view that you agree with and even when these publications lie you will eat everything up , because you feel like it validates your opinion . .  no , they do n't and they should n't . 
  rt is full of fake news . 
  it 's like saying that we should teach children evolution and creationism in school so that they get to hear `` both side '' . 
  `` both sides '' are n't equal if you compare rt to e.g. 
  the bbc or cnn . 
  that 's a bad analogy and thats not what i mean . 
  what i 'm saying you should verify whats true and whats not , that can only be achieved by looking for different sources than the one you usually use . . and if your view of world is `` what i disagree with is propaganda '' that 's where the problem is ... if rt and cnn talk about the same topic , but they obviously both say either different things or leave things out you should never assume cnn is speaking truth and rt is full of shit because its goverment funded . . because it could actually be cnn thats a propaganda in this case and you will just eat it up because again it goes with what you believe in . 
  recent elections are perfect example of media pushing their narrative full of lies whether it was pro-trump or pro-clinton . 
   you have a freaking information war happening right inside your borders do we ? 
  how would you know ? 
  i 'm not saying its not , just like every news outlet its pushing its ideas but that isnt exclusive to rt. 
  people need to look at both sides of the news and stop dismissing every bit of information one side provides and eat up everything the other side provides . 
  thats how you become a moron that lives in his own echo-chamber and loves to dismiss everything that does n't suit his own political views and beliefs . 
  every news outlet is pushing its own `` propaganda '' , you could mark everything as a propaganda . . 
  but than that would n't suit your narrative , here 's a tip : stop labeling everything you disagree with `` a propaganda '' and dismiss every information it provides . 
  instead take that information and compare it with other news and try to find out which news outlet is actually closer to the actual truth , because believe it or not even if rt is state sponsored it in many cases reports on stuff that the western media does n't because it doesnt fit their political views same goes for rt ofc . 
  muh everything i dont like is propaganda and should be banned .

  no you would n't , you would most likely call me a creep for wearing something like a gimp suit . 
  wearing a gimp suit or wearing overly sexual clothes is being openly gay ?

  in 2001 great britain sent few officials to prague airport , they forbid gypsies to board the planes to london . 
  this was because of another gypsy exodus : brits initially prepared to re-establish the visa , then backed down to these checks . 
  i read ( in czech media ) that india threatened norway to cancel some large business contract if the confiscated children were not returned home . 
  czech republic did nothing , just as skeptics expected .

   german citizens are somewhat more critical than the average of all europeans surveyed , of which 57 % are against immigrants from third countries . 
  source : http://www.euractiv.com/sections/global-europe/majority-germans-reject-immigration-outside-eu-312282 from my experience in my home country , i believe the sentiment on this sub is very representative of the vox populi . 
  i 'm on mobile so not really . 
  if you google it in english you 'll hopefully find it . 
  there are plenty of crazy people on all sides . 
  but i 'd rather argue with them then just label all of them `` nutjobs '' . 
  well , you do have a point , there are less and less people pro-immigration these days on this sub and in europe in general . 
  the essence of australia 's policy does n't rely on it 's remoteness -- the boats still used to reach them , after all -- but by having refugee camps in papua new guinea and not australia . 
  thus refugees know that if they try to immigrate illegally to australia , they will end up in papua new guinea instead , and there 's no use trying . 
  and lastly , you might call it racist , but that does n't change the fact that it 's true . 
  there has been studies proving indirect link between multi-ethnicity of a country and it 's gdp per capita . 
  i ca n't really find the one i read last time , but here 's a different one : http://www.amren.com/news/2013/05/a-revealing-map-of-the-worlds-most-and-least-ethnically-diverse-countries/, 
  if mandatory immigration quotas get put in place , you 're absolutely correct . 
  it 's not a secret though . 
  you might not have said it outright , but it 's been a pretty prevalent opinion among the pro-immigration crowd on this subreddit , and you alluded to it . 
  i think at a point where anti-immigration parties have large support in many if not most european countries , it 's time to stop calling people `` nutjobs '' just because they disagree with you on the topic . 
  i for one did n't downvote him , because i generally do n't do that very often , mostly just in cases of insults and the like . 
  how about you quote the entire relevant part , and not just the one that suits you . 
  the quote continues thus :  there has , however , been a longstanding `` first country of asylum '' principle in international law by which countries are expected to take refugees fleeing from persecution in a neighbouring state . 
  this principle has developed so that , in practice , an asylum seeker who had the opportunity to claim asylum in another country is liable to be returned there in order for his or her claim to be determined . 
  ad your example , no , that 's not ridiculous , that 's a * `` longstanding principle in international law '' * . 
  relevant authorities are granting asylum to refugees from syria , because it 's a practice in our countries to do so , but not because it 's mandated by international law , which as you can plainly see it is not . 
  and since eu ca n't cope with the amount of migrants , people like me are proposing we start giving out less asylum grants , since we 're not obligated to do it anyhow . 
  of course if your country disagrees , they are welcome to do it differently . 
  and if you really think your current policy is helping so much , watch [ this video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpjzfgchgle&amp;index=44&amp;list=wl ) , it has some interesting facts for you . 
  lastly , there 's absolutely no need to get nasty in the comments , calm down . 
  the suitable plan is called * exactly what australia did * and it has been proposed many times . 
  and there are no double standards . 
  western eu countries agreed to allow immigration of eastern eu citizens ( and there 's not that many that do that ) , and eastern eu allows western eu citizens . 
  nowhere did anyone agree to take vast masses of muslim people from the rest of the world that have very different values and thus will likely not integrate into the populations . 
  first off , please learn to use the quotation tool correctly . 
   most of the institutions you mentioned are formed by western european nations who coincidently also form the core of the eu i meantioned exactly one institution , the efta . 
  and efta is formed * exactly * only by countries not in the eu . 
  i have serious doubts about your language comprehension . 
  and all european countries have all the reasons to keep trade flowing , because any barriers arising would mean a huge economic crisis for all parties involved . 
  and lastly , you 're really not good with data . 
  of course usa/china , and western eu countries will be better represented on a list of trading partners , because they 're bigger block . 
  but if you combined entire eastern europe as one trading partner , it 'd take a very top position . 
  you 're misinformed . 
  the `` first safe country '' does n't have anything to do with eu .

  what i and most eastern europeans are arguing is that eu should n't be taking these economic migrants , neither west , nor east . 
  eu member states , as all states , have the obligation under international law to grant asylum to refugees when the country is the `` first safe country '' . 
  which is almost no eu country , since most refugees pass through turkey or some other country considered safe . 
  you completely misunderstand eastern europe if you think we do n't want to take a share of responsibility . 
  we disagree with the whole situation . 
  we believe eu should imitate australia in its approach to the issue , since taking in migrants has no end to it . 
  this is n't absolutely an issue of cost !, 
  this is a populist issue . 
  the general populace wo n't accept muslim migrants , it would topple governments . 
  eastern europeans see the mess that is the failed immigration policies in the west , and wo n't allow them to be repeated in their homes . 
  eu is n't the only institution that can eliminate tax barriers , see the efta i mentioned , and bilateral treaties . 
  noone wants to create barriers , east or west . 
  the east is a vast dumping ground for western products . 
  you 're vastly underestimating the economic connectedness of europe . 
  that 's false . 
  eu has benefited every single country , * especially * germany through their exploitation of the euro ( very little inflation in germany , significant inflation elsewhere in eurozone -  german products sell extremely well ) . 
  if you want to stop eu funds , that 's fine by us as they have come to symbolize corruption in most of eastern europe . 
  and 1/3 of the eu budget is agricultural bullshit anyway . 
  first off , there was no benefit for anyone to leave the eu during the greek crisis , so that 's not an argument at all . 
  if there 's a huge and very direct benefit -- leaving the eu means not having to accept immigrants ( incredibly unpopular ) -- they will do it . 
  and there will be trade between eu and the countries that exited still , there 's no problem with that . 
  these countries can join the efta or make bilateral agreements . 
  since it will be in the interest of everybody ( the west wants that trade too , because it benefits all parties ) , trade wo n't stop . 
  the current polls show that majority of czech people favour exiting the eu right now . 
  if the eu mandates immigrant relocation , the nation would literally rise up . 
   besides countires in eastern europe need the eu more than the eu needs them ... 
  i 'm certain of that . 
  but the eastern europe does n't * need * the eu that much either . 
  it could seriously fall apart . 
  already today the polls are saying majority of czech people would favour exiting the eu !, 
  if the eu starts to mandate immigrants relocation , i 'm 90 % certain we would leave . 
  i 'm sad to say i 'm * absolutely * not !, 
  at least in the czech republic , slovakia , poland and hungary i was honestly surprised by the wave of distaste towards a possible muslim immigration wave . 
  i did n't expect it to be so massive . 
  i 'm pretty certain these countries would * seriously * contemplate leaving the eu if push came to shove . 
  and we know the homeless people currently have absolutely no incentive to stop coming and the west is proposing that we do n't solve that and instead just distribute the homeless people evenly , so everyone suffers . 
  and the east end is saying `` are you fucking * crazy * you idiots ?! '', 
  this policy is * clearly * not working , we need to stop the homeless people from coming !, 
  have you seen how the australian street successfully solved the issue ? 
  it does n't falter at all !, 
  majority of countries simply refuse to extend the powers of the union to handling immigration . 
  the union does n't falter at all , since it mostly does n't involve handling immigration . 
  eu is mostly working fine . 
  what in god 's name makes you think the world is just ?!, 
  the world is incredibly ugly place where everyone 's out for himself and nothing more . 
  the fact of the matter is , immigration of large amounts of people with vastly different values makes country fare worse in both the short and long term , and even if we take millions , it wo n't even make a dent in the suffering of billions . 
  oh yes there is . 
  there are plenty of unequivocally great things working in the eu that nobody wants to undo . 
  such as no trade barriers , free movement of capital , etc. 
  when the majority of countries does not want to extend the powers of the eu to handling immigrants , it does n't mean we should trash the entire fucking project . 
  you know , germany ca n't always get what it wants . 
  yes . 
  read the law . 
  i 'm for staying in the eu , but he 's right . 
  the west * vastly * overestimates the importance of eu funds in most eastern bloc countries . 
  eu is great because it provides better trade conditions , harmonization of regulation , etc. 
  but the funds are n't why we 're in it .

  you can get them for free at planned parenthood . 
  if that 's not your thing you can go anywhere and buy them . 
  since most of our stores are open 24/7 it should never be a problem . 
  ah makes sense . 
  where do you live ? 
  we have them everywhere in new york . 
  his password was probably heslo, 
  what 's up with london 's salaries being so low ? 
  i thought it would be on par with us salaries . 
  actually a quite interesting article . 
  i was n't aware that germany had such a low percentage of super rich women . 
  i always assumed they were one of the more egalitarian societies . 
  why do you know indiana hahahahaha, 
  why do you have a penis on top of your country, 
  oh i love it too !, 
  its absolutely beautiful and a great place ... just not a place youd think to compare prices, 
  what a random village to put on this map haha, 
  i can tell you it 's very easy because i have one :d . heres the info in [ english ] ( http://www.mvcr.cz/mvcren/article/temporary-residence.aspx ) if you have any questions just let me know, 
  i do n't thinks so luckily . 
  all of my czech/slovak friends are always talking about how good they have it in prague right now . 
  they can switch jobs multiple times in a year without really having to worry that much . 
  oo also i forgot , i go to a portuguese restaurant all the time here . 
  there are always portuguese people hanging out all the time [ here ] ( http://www.cafeoliveira.cz/en/ ) if you would ever get homesick, 
  look at [ this ] ( http://grafton.jobs.cz/pd/1050711819/?ep=&amp;rps=233&amp;oldpd=1#fms=1 ) it says for graduates but honestly they probably do n't care and just put it there for show . 
  just send an application and see what happens, 
  they did for me . 
  it 's very good for both !, 
  check out expats.cz and jobs.cz to look at any jobs that might interest you . 
  i hope you can find the help you need !, 
  must be hard to avoid all the beer there though !, 
  more like i 'm so unbelievably lazy and i should probably not be doing all this redditing at work , 
  hahaha # 1 for me at least . 
  i really like it here, 
  yes !, 
  its very easy to find work in most fields . 
  as long as you speak a foreign language ( not czech ) it becomes even easier . 
  thats when i lived there !, 
  we probably saw each other haha, 
  but the difference is 30,000 crowns in czech republic lets you live a good life . 
  this wage at least back home ( in the usa ) would not even let you live . 
  here i could go out to eat everyday , live in a nice flat . 
  do basically whatever i wanted . 
  well the question is ... how does it taste ? 
  get a work holiday visa . 
  canadians are eligible for them . 
  you do n't even need to find a job right away you can live here for 1 year on them . 
  what good is this scaling ? 
  well i 'm from the usa :d . 
  so use that information as you want, 
  the average wage in prague is way above the minimum wage here . 
  if you 're any kind of professional you can expect from 30-70 thousand czech crowns . 
  i make a good bit more than 30 and i just turned 25 . 
  [ here is the first place ] ( https://www.google.com/maps/@50.0792095,14.4515511,3a,75y,111.2h,103.6t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1smo7mtpvy3oaijfdd-i9p3w!2e0!6s%2f%2fgeo2.ggpht.com%2fcbk%3fpanoid%3dmo7mtpvy3oaijfdd-i9p3w%26output%3dthumbnail%26cb_client%3dmaps_sv.tactile.gps%26thumb%3d2%26w%3d203%26h%3d100%26yaw%3d85.615%26pitch%3d0!7i13312!8i6656 ) i had two roomates in a 4 room flat with a kitchen . 
  it 's a very nice area in prague where tons of expats live . 
  now i live in a different neighborhood karlin , which i like even better . 
  it 's close to the center but also cheaper than vinohrady ( the place i showed the picture of ) [ here is my neighborhood now . 
  ] ( https://www.google.com/maps/place/ly%c4%8dkovo+n%c3%a1m.+karl%c3%adn,+186+00+praha-praha+8,+czech+republic/@50.0940441,14.4579049,3a,75y,163.6h,87.74t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1sdwy8w30pl-d5k5fatp_l1q!2e0!6s%2f%2fgeo0.ggpht.com%2fcbk%3fpanoid%3ddwy8w30pl-d5k5fatp_l1q%26output%3dthumbnail%26cb_client%3dmaps_sv.tactile.gps%26thumb%3d2%26w%3d203%26h%3d100%26yaw%3d330.24667%26pitch%3d0!7i13312!8i6656!4m2!3m1!1s0x470b94a6e8d7a3b5:0x2a22bf16bd7ca947 ) i share a one bedroom but 3 room flat with my girlfriend and it costs all together 13,000 czk . 
  that is 6,500 for each of us if you need the math done haha . 
  but that still means you have to live in a different culture with a different language and far from your family . 
  some people do n't mind but others do . 
  jobs.cz and expats.cz ... for jobs.cz i just type in keywords german it and thats how i found my job haha . 
  my girlfriend would just type in french . 
  we both found jobs in less than a week . 
  you could type in english and then something you do and you should be good to go , 
  haha is there a backstory behind this ? 
  what field are you looking in ? 
  in brno it 's also this way . 
  to be honest , since i do n't speak czech very well it would be hard for me to find work outside of prague and brno . 
  haah i think i know these videos you speak of, 
  there are all kinds of jobs . 
  jobs where you do n't need any degree , jobs where you do need some and ones for higher levels . 
  i work in it doing infrastructure stuff . 
  but my girlfriend ( french ) worked in hotel relations . 
  i also have a swedish friend here who does a marketing job and has no degree in anything . 
  edit : salary to rent ratio well when i was doing an entry level job right after college i got paid 30,000 czech crowns and my rent was 6,000 czech crowns . 
  now i get paid more and my rent is still the same . 
  so you can do the math on that or convert it to your own currency . 
  you can come work here too !, 
  there are so many spanish people already here . 
  i 've actually worked with a few greek people here in prague . 
  all of them said their whole university classes have left to find jobs in other eu countries . 
  i do n't even speak czech and i get job offers all the time since i speak english/german . 
  truly a good place right now if you 're a young professional, 
  if you walked around for 20 minutes right now in prague you could find a job . 
  everybody i know is employed and gets job offers regularly . 
  i 'm assuming the dutch are just the only ones honest about it ? 
  why the fuck do you post it now ... these posts never get any comments because of it, 
  what a shitty time to start a thread, 
  france really does n't pay their professionals that well though so the col ratio is still quite skewed since paris is very expensive . 
  with that being said my girlfriend left france because the pay is n't that great and the col is high . 
  she makes a little bit less in the czech republic and its cheap to live here . 
  one of the biggest things is that housing eats up a lot more of your income than it does back in the states . 
  also you get paid a lot less for professional positions in europe than in the states . 
  i work in it and made over 70k in the states but make less than 40k in germany and in czech republic . 
  those are the biggest cons by far . 
  europe just does n't pay it 's professionals very well compared to the states the biggest pro by far in europe is the amount of free time you have . 
  i had over 35 days vacation his year all paid . 
  the most i ever had in america was 15 days . 
  i also like how cheap it is to travel throughout europe . 
  everything is so close you can just go on weekend trips everywhere .

  this means we can get away with more stuff at work because our bosses are too afraid to confront the russians . 
  romanians , with all this good news about your country are you actually personally feeling any of it ? 
  are your wages going up and can you see new infrastructure being built ? 
  kaliningrad will sucede from russia and join the eu edit : thank you / u/yorashtan2 and / u/ajaume _ 2 for pointing out that i do n't know how to spell sucede ( succeed ) how embarassing, 
  i was trying to respond to what `` most '' americans would think . 
  i obviously ca n't talk for the other 6.8 billion people, 
  if we are being completely honest most americans do n't think about it at all . 
  the average american has heard about it but does n't really care what happens there . 
  ha tell me about it . 
  as an american working in europe , i am constantly the butt of every joke in the office . 
  even though my office is comprised of many different european countries they can all agree that making fun of my `` american-ness '' is funny . 
  it 's all in good fun though and i 've never been offended by any of it . 
  [ source ] ( http://jakubmarian.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/beer-consumption.jpg ) a pretty cool website where you can find a ton of different maps, 
  seriously there are shooting ranges everywhere also . 
  i went shooting a couple weeks ago with a bunch of my czech colleagues all whom own guns, 
  you will not regret that decision . 
  i usually fly in with lufthansa from prague to newwark . 
  return tickets are usually about 500 usd, 
  well you also have to remember , that at airports like jfk and lax so many people are immigrating to the us . 
  this amounts to hundreds of people who many of them do n't speak any english trying to figure out what to do . 
  it causes mayhem . 
  seriously ... last time i was flying back to jfk with my girlfriend who is european and i 'm american we flew into a terminal which did n't differentiate non americans to us citizens . 
  it was about a 3 hour line we had to wait in . 
  on top of that i would say only about half of the workers there spoke any english . 
  i was joking with my girlfriend that i was so excited to speak native english again but it was n't until we got to my parents that i actually heard english . 
  a french couple asked the security guard ( a chinese guy ) a question about where they should go and he could n't speak back to them in proper english . 
  i eventually had to tell them where to go because the guy was so clueless . 
  moral of this story ? 
  fly into newark . 
  one month later i flew into newark and my slovak friend and i waited for 10 minutes in line and no other problems . 
  well as most immigrants/expats who live here will tell you ... even though it sucks to not know the language you do n't need it . 
  even though my czech is n't so good i 've never had any issues while living here . 
  only when i go to the bureaucratic offices is there ever any issues ( but mostly because the people there are the worst ), 
  yep i 'm currently living in prague ... i studied/worked a bit in germany and now i do some it work for an american company in prague, 
  i 'm from america but have lived/worked in germany and czech republic . 
  i am not proud of america . 
  i like the country and the people , even though they are not so popular on reddit . 
  i hate our government and i think 90 % of americans will agree with me on this regardless of being republican or democrat . 
  after living in different countries i became much less `` proud '' of america because i can see that life at least in europe is not so much different and it 's very similar in many ways . 
  this led me to believing that we really are n't a special country in any way . 
  so while even though i still like america why should i be proud if we are n't more special than anybody else . 
  true ... but between brno and prague it 's still a large part of the working population . 
  in prague everybody is sitting behind a computer, 
  honestly , i think he should stay in zimbabwe and face the consequences . 
  i hope the us government does n't let him off the hook . 
  i hate when people with money think they can get away with anything . 
  honestly with all the education in the world today about wildlife preservation and this idiot goes to africa to shoot a rare animal ? 
  what a clown . 
  bangladesh has 150 million people and utah has 3 million ... jesus, 
  good thing czech republic/slovkia are not on this list . 
  they would probably top all other eu countries, 
  we generally get paid much better than europe for professional jobs ... i 'm not sure where you 're getting your information from, 
  hell man ... after 50 hours i 'm completely burned out ... i do n't know how you do it, 
  jesus what do you do ? 
  i agree that its what people do with their lives that show how good life is . 
  i do n't think anybody can argue with that . 
  i guess i was just shocked when i moved to germany because i had unrealistic expectations . 
  i assumed that since it was a rich country i would be paid similar as in the us . 
  in my field the average pay for entry level people in the city i was working in was around 60k usd per year ( richmond va ) . 
  in germany i found that it was about half of this . 
  even with the more affordable healthcare and better public transportation you are still left with a lot less money . 
  however i loved every minute of living in germany and who knows maybe one day i 'll go back . 
  i always wanted to live all around the world and see what was outside of my small town in america . 
  living in germany and in czech republic has been amazing . 
  both places are amazing in their own way and now i 'm not sure if i want to leave, 
  i am also curious to know what field she was working in , where her salary was so low in the us and then so high in switzerland . 
  we tend to pay our professionals better than most countries in the world . 
  i just want to point out a common misconception , while yes people who work in europe do get better social benefits working the usa is n't all that bad . 
  we do get paid a very good wage compared to europe . 
  i have worked in germany , czech republic , and the usa and the salary i got at my first job in america was over double what i made in germany and over 4x more than i make in czech republic . 
  americans still do have a very high average disposable income compared to almost every single country in the world . 
  while there is a big wealth gap there still is a very big middle class who earns a good wage compared to europe . 
  just look at [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_average_wage ) i know this does n't tell the whole story but it does help show that things are n't all bad my anecdotal evidence . 
  my friends in belgium who work in it are happy with their 3,000 euro salary . 
  in the united states this would be considered a very low salary for the field and in belgium it 's considered normal where it 's much more expensive, 
  these kind of articles are so dumb ... some people like to live in different places , who gives a shit ... i swear as an american living in europe my least favorite kind of people are expats like her . 
  am i really the only american who left that thinks we are n't the worst country in the world ? 
  nope !, 
  a logistics company ... not one of the usual big ones here, 
  thankfully no ... i work at an american company here in prague and do it for the belgian offices, 
  i would like to thank belgium especially , because since they are always on holiday it means i never have anything to do at work . 
  i 'm guessing the really big growth came when they made europe a default for anybody with a european ip ? 
  i tried my best, 
  just stay out of prague 1 and the beer is cheap ... in my neighborhood 7 minutes from the center by tram beer is 27 czech crowns for .5 liters , which is 1 euro for really good beer, 
  the quality of the comments for this thread is terrible, 
  i do n't disagree ... i was shocked when last week there was protests against islamization of czech republic in prague ... only like .01 % of the population is islamic, 
  with all the protests in prague already against refugees i doubt this will go over well, 
  i live in the czech republic now and i work a shit ton less than in the usa ( my anecdotal evidence ) also i would 've assumed japan to be the highest b/c of those crazy hours the [ salarymen ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po8iph64rvm ) work where they literally do nothing all day but ca n't leave until bossman does, 
  true ... but i have no statistics to back anything i said up , i do n't know if more men are coming than women ... i was just taking a guess, 
  i think what probably happens is the men go to find work to send back money to their family ... this is what happens in america with central americans . 
  i was more trying to highlight the fact that lichtenstein makes more in a month than romania in a year , 
  you can find the sources here in the subtext on wikipedia https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_european_countries_by_average_wage, 
  yes while its true very rich people live there ... the wages in the us are generally a bit higher especially when it comes to being a professional ... 
  i 'm from america and have lived in germany/czech republic and the wages for my field it are not even remotely close to what i was getting paid in america . . and i was living in a very low cost area, 
  the czech republic has low wages but you do n't see so many emigrants at all ... i would say almost all of my czech friends have no plans of moving to another country ... but i 'm not sure if the czech republic is just the exception here, 
  is it possible to not hang out with douche bags ? 
  the uk has 64 million people ... i 'm sure you could find like minded people all over, 
  take a bus from budapest to prague ... its super cheap and prague is also isnt very expensive like budapest, 
  usa , prague , will move to the south of france and then back to the usa or prague, 
  any reason why ?

  when i lived in cz , i never needed vpn , it 's not legal but nobody enforces the law . 
  nobody ever got fined , unless they were a big time pirate / uploader . 
   not sure how strongly enforced it is in germany . 
  i know two people in germany who had to pay up for torrenting and one more who turned it around . 
  so it does get enforced to some extent . 
  these comments actually make me wonder if i 've been living in a rough neighborhood , because i saw fights started as easy as : * with throwing an ice cube at someone --  [ big fight ] ( https://www.google.de/maps/place/%c5%98epy,+163+00+prague+17,+czechia/@50.0705152,14.2987309,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x470bbe2e594d1663:0x43c9e7d3dca72107!8m2!3d50.0705118!4d14.3009196?hl=en ) * calling someone '' * debil * '' ( retard ) --  [ offender got defenestrated .

   you wo n't cause a fist fight , but a ** shooting ** . 
  france , you scary \u0ca0_\u0ca0, 
   you have no language tests ? 
  we do have language tests , but it 's not a part of the process of permanent residency - only for applying for the citizenship . 
  foreigners can totally live here permanently and not speak a word of czech officially . 
  torrenting has two main issues . 
  * it 's by no stretch of the word legal . 
  you grab copyrighted content and save it on your hard drive . 
  and if you 're smart enough to set up a torrenting client , good luck trying to defend yourself saying you did n't know what the implications of your actions are or that * you did n't know * * torrenting sites and amount of content have gone way downhill in the last few years . 
  i barely ever find what i 'm looking for unless it 's `` a thing '' now , like trendy show or movie . 
   most probable reaction would be `` oh this guy is stupid . 
  too bad '' . 
  in my neighborhood , this would totally lead to a fight . 
  of course provided it was said loudly enough , if possible in a pub and with a unfavorable comparison to * bud light *  communists write this quite often . 
  no one got beaten so far . 
  people have the courage to write all kind of shit online , because they know they can get away with it . 
  there 's no internet bitchslap or suckerpunch . 
  just look at youtube comments , you 'll find anything from denying the holocaust to encouraging suicide . 
  this is really not the kind of question to be asking europe , but people who live in the cities you named . 
  the chance that people from those two neighborhoods hang out in this subreddit is small . 
  please post this question to the cities ' subreddits instead . 
  it 's worrying - not only because of the legal side , but also because of the availability of the shows . 
  let 's take germany and where you can watch shows that you want . 
  * tv - outdated or uninteresting . 
  cost ineffective and not flexible . 
  * youtube - barely any content that is qualitatively comparable with a tv show . 
  * netflix / amazon prime video - legal but the selection sucks . 
  there , i said it . 
  there 's just always something missing . 
  i keep on angrily searching for shows i like but i find like 2 / 10 . 
  and this is a paid service , mind you . 
  * torrenting - not legal , not safe , vpn costs money * streaming - the only semi-legal way to watch whatever you like . 
  take streaming away and what 's left for you is an expensive mess with limited availability . 
  if you want to watch all of your favorite shows , might as well pay for three services and a vpn , so monthly about 50 $ . 
  wow . 
  he probably has nothing coming to him . 
  after 15 years , he 's well in the period where he can pretty much get permanent residency immediately ( if he does n't have it already ) - of course keeping his british citizenship if things went downhill . 
  effectively , this guy is laughing his ass off in his comfortable getaway while his vote helped sink his countrymen 's currency and cost of living . 
  it 's like turks in europe who voted pro erdogan . 
  * edit : * bonus points if his pro-brexit reasoning included '' * damn foreigners * '', 
  '' * i 'm not an immigrant mate , i 'm here only temporarily - i 'm an expat . 
  ironically , in prague the most non-conformist foreigners are americans and brits . 
  they only speak their language , do n't even try to learn czech . 
  usually live in neighborhoods together , only hang out with each other . 
  it 's kind of a ghetto if you think about it , just not low-income . 
  all of them are employed ( or their significant others are ) and cause no trouble , so the general population pretty much just shrugs about them . 
  some people of course see foreigners who do n't speak the language as a serious problem , but that kind of people have problems with most foreigners . 
   she also told me that the american milatary is n't just on the polands border but in other places as well there are american military bases all over europe so this does n't strike me as odd at all . 
   she was telling me how in the last few weeks , american military has been lining up across polands border that would very likely be one of the joint military exercises of americans with a local army . 
  this is fairly common , the bigger ones go about once a year . 
   she told me how her cousin was sending her pics of troops and that they were destroying property what kind of property ? 
  like blowing up a house , or like running over a bench in a park with an abrams ? 
  or more like getting drunks and kicking a trash bin ? 
   what is the situation over there ? 
  to be honest this is pretty normal in europe , i 'm not aware of an actual escalation right now . 
  russia flies bombers near someone 's borders , nato fighters engage . 
  russia has a training exercise near the borders , nato does a joint exercise near the borders . 
  russia complains about nato anti-missile systems , nato complains about russian missiles . 
  two big militaries are measuring whose dick is bigger . 
  rinse and repeat ad nauseam . 
   i have been learning french using duoling for a while now , the problem is i have literally no opportunity to practice it or get better without leaving have you thought about a language tandem ? 
  in case you 're not familiar with the concept , two people meet ( weekly/every day/whenever they have time ) and they speak half the time in one language , and the other half in the other language . 
  it 's like language exchange , friendly atmosphere that does not punish you for making mistakes . 
  i 've had really good experience ( and good progress ) and continue to set up tandem meetings even though i probably do n't really need them anymore . 
   gb has a lot of immigrants , and there will definitely be some french among them . 
  maybe you can offer them to help with english and they can get your french up to speed ? 
  there may be some facebook groups near you , try having a look around . 
  if not , it gets tougher and you 'd have to be looking for a skype pal , which is a fair bit less convenient ( but some people like it better ), 
   is the kind of blasphemy we have in italy something other european countries have ? 
  [ i have to share the report this thread got with you guys ] ( http://imgur.com/k8rhsov ) :d, 
   i did n't say they had no internet , i said it 's only been recently that you could learn languages online . 
  hardly enough time to become an expert or fluent . 
  come on , those are seriously just excuses . 
  three years ago i started learning german at home by myself with duolingo and watching german channels on youtube . 
  today i live in germany , have a good career here and german friends . 
  maybe you can not become completely fluent in 3 years , but you can be good enough to get hired and work for 8 hours every day in the new language . 
   you 're taking the piss with those last two , right ? 
  anki is n't a learning resource , it 's a flash-card generator . 
  yes , that 's how i practice new vocabulary . 
  what better way is there to memorize things ? 
  i can see your point and partially i agree with you , but i just ca n't nod to phrases like '' * impossible to do * '' and '' * no opportunity * '' . 
   you do n't know what his situation is . 
  i do n't , but i can tell they have an internet connection . 
  most people learn languages * well * by exposure to the language - reading articles , watching shows , listening to music . 
  it 's all there . 
   it 's only been recently that you could consider learning a language online in my poor post-communist country it 's been a possibility for about 15 years now , so i 'm guessing it ca n't be that bad in yours either . 
   and the resources are n't free [ duolingo ] ( https://www.duolingo.com/ ) [ anki ] ( https://apps.ankiweb.net/ ) [ youtube ] ( https://www.youtube.com/ ) grammar , vocabulary , listening . 
  language tandem ( it 's also free ) for speaking , at least 2-3 hours per week . 
  the rest is practice and dedication . 
  i know that learning languages is hard and that many people wo n't start unless they have a good reason to ( which op seems to have if they want to live abroad ) , but saying '' * i had no opportunity * '' ? 
  kids in africa have no opportunity . 
  tribals in south america get no opportunity .

why not both ? 
  mine was 2nd :( london . ^ / s, 
  against regular austrians , no . 
  why should be ? 
  it happened a long time ago , not many people remember first republic , let alone austria-hungary . 
  there is an occasional mention of the concerns some austrians have about temel\u00edn ( to which alot of czechs ' opinion is something like `` who cares , it 's * our * power plant , not like there 's gon na be a tsunami in our country '' ) . 
  other than that , we do n't hear about you too much . 
  but a lot of people like to go to alps and things like kommissar rex . 
  ... until they suddenly are n't . 
  `` voluntarily gave '' ? 
  do you even know anything about the situation ? 
  munich agreement ? 
  not to mention , poland clearly said they would not allow passage to soviet troops in case of german invasion against cze ( which , sure , sounds dubious , but it still shows that obviously everybody turned their back on us ), 
  oh , do n't worry , he will give people donuts and they will vote for him again . 
  sad truth is , the polls show his party in 1st/2nd place . 
  i do n't understand most of my voters in this country, 
  who the hell came up with this name ? 
  no forced germanization or complaints about our nuclear plants and we 're okie doke, 
  if i ask google `` pro\u010d jsou angli\u010dan\u00e9 ... '' ( `` why are the english ... '' ) it suggests : `` pro\u010d angli\u010dan\u00e9 jezd\u00ed vlevo '' ( `` why do the english drive on the left ? '' ), 
  damn , as somebody who likes mead i 'm dissapointed now :( . 
  but also about my country , damn , it 's ancient goodness that is wonderful both cold and hot , what 's not to like ? 
  imo , just the fact that the party has this extreme wing and other nutjobs makes them dangerous . 
  that sort of people would answer to the question `` do you denounce crimes of previous regime ? '', 
  `` well ... you know , let 's rather talk about the real issues blablabla ... '' instead of just `` yes '' . 
  they could be called alt-left . 
  orthcan ? 
  this is awesome til , can i ask , how it came to that ( big event , or slow progression ) ? 
  did bulgarian ever had cases ? 
  you got it basically right , especially ano . 
  i would like to add this : ods - used to be top 2 party ( rivals of \u010cssd ) , but they were a nest of lobbyists and corporatists and after one corrupt , scandal-filled government ( when they were in power ) , their support tanked . 
  kdu-\u010csl - as you have said , total flip-floppers that are about the `` family values '' and all that jazz ... top 09 - they are different from ano mainly because their leaders ( babi\u0161 vs. kalousek ) hate and trashtalk each other all the time and they are not-so one man show . 
  babi\u0161 is big part of ano , and with him also his large business + corruption + hurting competition through laws etc. 
  kalousek does n't have anything like that ( does n't make him a saint though ) . 
  also to add \u010cssd - social democrats , which occasionally come up with some ridiculous proposition ( more frequently before the elections , like now their proposed tax plan , which generated some controversy ) , probably because they want to gain some attention , or their sjw section , which makes them unelectable for me ( especially people like [ her ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/michaela_marksov%c3%a1 ) goes to work, 
  the thing is , people hoped that they would be seen as so stupid and backwards compared to the awesome new democracy \u00ae , that there would be no need to even outlaw them - they would n't gather any support . 
  but , things turned out differently . 
  to be honest , it 's much better when they have proper label on them ( not like some ex-communists did n't `` defect '' to other parties , but that 's a different story ) . 
  could you explain please ? 
  does/can any french person think about the vichy france and its puppet regime anything positive ? 
  if there 's any country where this guy would want asylum , it 's russia or china . 
  * ... awkward silence ... * ** then the winged hussars arrived **, 
  it seems like a ` we 've had enough of this shit ' mentality . 
  we used to have a polish priest in our little town next to the border , and he was very nice person ( atheist here , of course ) . 
  his czech was funny , but understandable enough . 
  then he left and the next one - definitely czech - was a total asshole . 
  '' \u010dechi\u0161 '' germans waste a lot of letters on us , too . 
   you took your time to be brave well , it was n't me , nor any other czech currently alive . 
   please read about that . 
  again , i know of these events , i was refering to the majority of the population . 
   friends like you are better to be keept go ahead . 
  poland and czechoslovakia definitely were n't `` friends '' back then ( [ what could have been ... ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/intermarium ) ) yes , from today 's point of view , it was a very `` dickish '' move that resulted in hundreds of senseless deaths and injuries , but this was different , much more dangerous and chaotic europe , which had just seen the end of the great war and various ( some very old ) empires collapsed . 
  now , i do n't think anybody here would even consider things like e.g. 
  invading cieszyn ...  it does sound ridiculous does n't it ? 
  i think that this shows what progress we 've made ... 
  i do n't think a lot of people even know about this today , and those who do , do n't really give a shit . 
  i do n't think i understand what you mean by ` do you consider ... ' , if you mean if people give it a thought - i would say even less people know about that polish-soviet conflict than about this  . 
  if you mean it like ` if i have considered it as a part of the reason why we `` won '' ' , then yes , definitely, 
  98 years ago , we had a. . . [ dispute ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish%e2%80%93czechoslovak_war ) ... with our neighbours,

  common - yes . 
  normal people - yes . 
  day by day - not really ( i imagine not many people have it more than once per 2 months , people who love it probably order it often in restaurants or cook it more often ) . 
  fancy - definitely fancier than sma\u017e\u00e1k - you find it in restaurants , not fast foods ( and even then , not all of the restaurants use the proper meat ) . 
  do n't know what 's `` little finger rising '' , never heard that expression  . 
  fast-foods serve it basically as a `` hamburger '' with a piece of good old fried edamer/hermel \u00edn instead of a meat patty . 
  [ sma\u017een\u00fd s\u00fdr ( fried cheese ) ] ( https://easybaked.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/img_2648.jpg ) - usually served with fries/chips or in a bun as a sandwich on the go [ sv\u00ed\u010dkov\u00e1 na smetan\u011b ] ( https://sfa.familymarket.cz/files/katalog_full_3012533.jpg ) - beef sirloin in cream sauce with dumplings , sometimes with sour cream and/or cranberries too [ \u0160vestkov\u00e9 knedl\u00edky ] ( https://www.albert.cz/imgm/yte5mjmtd2lkzufyzwf8ytkwndczfgeyotq4nxxhnziynjrafm-x/96230.jpg ) - plum dumplings , served with butter , powdered sugar and poppy seed, 
   if czech people ca n't handle a democratic vote then idk man , the problem ai n't with the eu . 
  ok . me and some other bloke will vote 2:1 against you that you should let migrant from sub-saharan africa into your house , let him sleep there and feed him . 
  democratic , right ? 
  no problem there . 
   i 'd really like to see how the czech parties would sell an exit to the public considering how much of a disaster that would be for you . 
  i would n't , but if eu ( more specifically , the ec ) pisses population off too much , it wo n't be too hard for the politicians to raise support for leaving union even at a significant cost . 
  i do n't see that in a foreseeable future , but retarded shit like quotas is slowly getting us there . 
  '' \u0161koda '' means `` damage '' in czech language too , but it just happens that it was the name of [ the guy ] ( https://cs.wikipedia.org/wiki/emil_%c5%a0koda ) . 
  pretty unfortunate , given that it 's car company , but such is life . 
  it 's not a change , it 's an alternative . 
  seize the genes of population . 
  wait , that 's not right , is it ? 
   populists winning in ... czech republic ... 
  if you mean populists = ano , then they are not anti-eu - in fact , our current eurocommissar jourov\u00e1 is from ano and she 's pretty pro-establishment if you mean populists = \u00dasvit / spd , they do n't have a chance of winning if you mean `` populists '' = president ( zeman ) , that is possible , but that 's the beginning of the next year and the president has little power,

   an army with trump as commander in chief couldnt even find its way here well , they 're already here, 
   oposmlouva did happed in the past exactly , it was almost 20 years ago , in different political situation under different circumstances . 
  and if ods gets this year half of the % of votes they gained in ' 98 , they can count themselves lucky . 
  after fiala 's constant `` we wo n't be in a government which does n't repeal eet '' a coalition with ano would be the last nail in their coffin . 
   we have no idea what zeman would do if he actually had to solve some of our countrys problems instead of just commenting on them . 
  well , he used to be prime minister . 
   ovcacek is basically sessions !,

  here 's the real one , not pulled out of an ass : https://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/asian, 
  i will bet you $ 10 eurobucks they wo n't manage to stop them without a wall . 
  got any bitcoins ? 
  absolutely not at all . 
  those people are simply traversing the country and causing very little direct harm . 
  there 's absolutely no chance in hell anyone orders to slaughter them . 
  you 're either psychotic or not very intelligent if you think it can come to that . 
  nope . 
  by mindfields ? 
  the argument about army was edited in by / u / _ ich _ afterwards . 
  well , they 're using kids as human shields . 
  and they outnumber you . 
  and they 'll sneak through somewhere where you wo n't expect them . 
  did hungary manage to stop them without a fence ? 
  and if it 's so easy to stop them without a fence , why did they build a fence ? 
  correct . 
  but i do n't think anyone will give them a permission to slaughter them . 
  well , that 's what i * do n't * think , if you 'll read my comment . 
  well , you edited that into your comment after i already responded . 
  anyway , army ca n't stop the migrants anyway . 
  unless they have some mobile wall , they ca n't do much . 
  there 'll always be more migrants , more determined to get through . 
  except that does n't help . 
  the minefields are not on the border ( look it up ) , and once they 're in croatia , they ca n't do anything to them . 
  they 'll probably walk on a road or take buses and trains . 
  far away from any mines . 
  so does anyone know how they want to close the border ? 
  are they planning to build a fence ? 
  because without a fence , i do n't think they can really hold tens of thousands of people . 
  ehm , i do n't think european parents are anywhere close to that . 
  what the fuck . 
  how about we give large incentives for people to have kids ? 
  how has no one at least considered that if they see this as such a huge problem ? 
  and on top of that in the left text it says that your attitude to roma people is at -85 , which is completely out of scale . 
   which begs the question : is there any nation in europe that actually likes roma people/gypsies ? 
  finally some long term solution are starting to be fleshed out . 
  we need to curb the pull factors so only real refugees come . 
  the latest figures put syrians at only 20 % of the migrant wave after all . 
  think of it in a different way , we 're now much closer to a full fence over the balkan route to the eu . 
  when the full fence is up , the migration wave will collapse to a significant degree . 
  you 're right . 
  the rate of increase is increasing as well !, 
  what ? 
  that 's bullshit . 
  since catalonia is not considering that move as far as i know , i think it 's not that easy . 
  they will . 
  not really . 
  nationality in europe is not determined by where a kid is born ( [ like in the americas ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jus_soli ) ) , but [ by blood ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jus_sanguinis ) . 
  they will be still your citizens . 
  no problem . 
  well , why should hungary budge ? 
  so they get flooded instead of croatia ? 
  that makes no sense . 
  i 'm not talking about migrants . 
  i 'm talking about human rights . 
  they might bar them from entering perhaps , dunno . 
  well , i have this policy of not downvoting opinions even if i disagree . 
  so i just wanted to clarify that this comment really deserves a downvote , since it provides no content , no opinion , just insults . 
  that has no relation to your claim that it 's our `` responsibility '' which it is n't . 
  and those educated and rich people should be helping in syria now and after the war . 
  without them , how can they rebuild their nation if they leave it only to the poor and destitute stuck in refugee camps in middle east ? 
  downvoted for providing no actual content to the discussion . 
  back to eastern europe to the countries where they hold citizenship , as per eu laws . 
   and as a potential superpower these refugees are your responsibility . 
  lol . 
  well , not really . 
  to live in a different eu country one has to support themself there . 
  these people will be deported after a while . 
  it 's ok , sweden can take them all . 
  they do not have any legal way to proclaim independence , and spain completely refuses to even grant them a referendum . 
  so catalans proclaimed that the next catalan elections will serve as a sort-of referendum , with each political party declaring before hand if they are for or against the independence . 
  since he controls the russian media , he can do whatever he wants there and he 'll look like a winner at home anyway . 
  well , diplomatically forced , they said it was insulting to call it constantinople . 
  roughly at the beginning of the 20th century . 
  anyhow , not exactly . 
  the christian era is entirely covered by the name constantinople , whereas the muslim era is split between constantinople and istanbul . 
  so if the guy wanted to point out the christian era where the city really was the most important in europe , it was definitively constantinople . 
  actually , the turks forced europe to use the name istanbul ( even though it was not right after the fall of constantinople ) , that 's why the two names can now be used to refer to the different eras of the city . 
  well , no . 
  constantinople was greek/late roman and christian . 
  instanbul refers to the turkic and muslim era where the city ceased to be connected with europe to a large degree , and thus became less important to europe . 
  well , technically , the city you 're referring to was constantinople . 
  allah appears to be playing the long con though . 
  what ? 
  they did exactly that . 
  watch the video . 
  they threw rocks and shouted allahu akbar , i.e. 
  `` allah is [ the ] greatest . '', 
  the phrase `` to be reminded of '' means that upon seeing it you think it 's similar to the holocaust . 
  they 're saying that he likened the situation to the holocaust , not that somebody reminded him of it . 
  well , syrians are already not a majority between the current migration wave . 
  people from africa and asia are starting to come in ever increasing numbers . 
  syrian refugees were just the first that proved it 's possible , now the floodgates are open . 
  you might say not all of them will be granted asylum -- but many of them will , because there are plenty of wars and unstable countries in africa . 
  but the main issue is that we wo n't be able to deport them , because they 'll throw away their passports . 
  why do n't you have them [ human rights ] in russia then ? 
  that is true . 
  maybe a link to it should be permanently stickied ? 
  well , do n't worry about it then , the refugee crisis wo n't be over for decades , or maybe ever . 
  sure , but there 's only 5 million people to visit on the other end .

apples and oranges , mate . 
  8.3 % is not imperceptible , especially when you consider the ferry is travelling for 24 hours . 
  assuming they wanted the flag to be as small as say even 1 cm , that 's a 3 % difference . 
  tiny , pretty much impossible to tell the difference without an extremely precise ruler . 
  0.3 mm is an imperceptible difference . 
  expecting anything to be that precise , especially some sort of newspaper graphic , is ridiculous . 
  i 'm amazed by how many people have no problem with sending in police officers to bother people who have done nothing wrong , `` just to be safe '' . 
  there 's something absolutely wrong with that to me , not just from a financial perspective , but from a moral perspective . 
  yes , that 's fine . 
  that 's what i 'm talking about - emergency operators are trained to figure out if there 's actually something going on . 
  now imagine the conversation instead went `` no , i do n't '' when the operator asked if there was an emergency . 
  if the caller said `` no '' when asked if someone was in the room and preventing them from speaking freely . 
  at that point , the operator would be on good grounds to tell them to stop wasting peoples time . 
  but no - in this thread , you have a mass of idiots who want police to show up to every single call , regardless of how stupid . 
  must n't take any chances !, 
  do n't let the operator figure anything out , let 's just waste resources , because * you never know * . 
  actually , you can know , and your example clearly demonstrates this . 
  it 's a question of math . 
  number of idiots calling emergency services ( quite high ) vs number of highly trained emergency operators who * might * make a mistake , an unlikely mistake when someone is * clearly being an idiot * and abusing emergency services . 
  but it seems like there are a lot of people on here who are clearly incapable of making that distinction . 
  maybe the same number of people who think calling 911/112 over a flag is a good idea . 
  those people should not be emergency operators . 
  you know why they are ignoring domestic abuse calls ? 
  probably because they are stretched too thin . 
  stretched too thin by idiotic things like the war on drugs , or idiots calling about not getting enough french fries with their burger . 
  there 's a big difference between someone genuinely calling out for help , and some paranoid idiot who thinks that a blue flag with gold stars is somehow dangerous . 
  if you ca n't tell the difference , you just may be on the level of that idiot . 
  but drr , what if they are under duress ? 
  durr !, 
  yea , i think operators can make that call , too . 
  islamic state shmislamic state . 
  we 're talking about 10,000 idiots running around the middle east with guns and lots of oil money . 
  shit , wait , when did that change ? 
  oh yea , since never . 
  a flag is n't worth a police response . 
  it just ai n't . 
  right , because it 's impossible to distinguish whether or not someone is under duress , or if they are attempting to waste public resources by complaining about a * flag * . 
  good grief . 
  i love the straw men i 'm getting in this . 
  no one is suggesting that an operator should ignore calls on a whim . 
  it 's a question of is this person clearly being an idiot and abusing the emergency services . 
  if they are , then i think we 'd all be better off if the emergency services were available for actual emergencies , rather than idiots wasting everyone 's time . 
  but what if the body was your kid ?!!? 
  ( ca n't wait for this argument ), 
  sorry , but your approach also makes that a distinct possibility . 
  by responding to every call , no matter how clearly stupid , there 's a good chance police will be busy with nonsense instead of being available for an actual emergency . 
  on top of that , your approach guarantees the need for a bigger police department than an area actually needs , so as to service every idiotic call . 
  right , which is a point where they could say `` hm , maybe we can reduce the police budget rather than paying people to sit around waiting for someone to call about something completely pointless . '', 
  yes , a community needs a police force , but there is such a thing as having too much police . 
  yes , and in that situation the operator could presumably figure out what 's going on . 
  in this situation , you have someone calling over a flag . 
  there 's no yelling/screaming in the background . 
  the caller is probably not freaked out and is responding normally . 
  at that point , the operator should be able to figure out that this caller is a complete idiot , and no , they 're not going to deal with it . 
  emergency operators are mostly smart enough to figure out what needs a response and what does n't , we do n't need a `` zero tolerance '' approach where every call immediately requires the cavalry to be sent . 
  in this case , it sounds more like a zero tolerance approach than allowing the operator to deduce that a complaint about a fucking flag does n't warrant any one looking into it . 
  because there 's a limited number of police , and they need to respond to actual emergencies . 
  the operator already does decide what warrants what level of response , and there certainly should be a `` please do n't abuse this service * click * '' response . 
  in the event of domestic abuse , the caller could easily start making up some conversation that clearly does n't jive . 
  the operator could deduce that the caller is in trouble . 
  but if you call up , and coherently complain that really at issue is a * flag * , operator asks and confirms that 's what the issue is , caller responds coherently and without any clear distress , then it 's pretty obvious to see that the caller is an idiot . 
  what you 're talking about is a `` zero exception '' approach . 
  this `` no thinking , just do x * every single time * '' . 
  those approaches are stupid , wasteful , and result in more bullshit for everyone . 
  oh come on . 
  do they ? 
  would the police send out officers if you called them to tell them that you ca n't find your ice cream spoon ? 
  or could they have just said `` sir , you 're too stupid to be using a phone , please do n't call us again . '', 
  drugs do n't create crime - the criminalization of drugs creates crime . 
  obviously , if drugs are legal , then crime rates would go down ( less actions would qualify as crimes ) . 
  but if you take it a step further , and * give drugs * to addicts ( through a government program ) you could reduce crime even further . 
  rather than smashing into a car window to steal a few euro for their next fix , addicts could get their drugs for free , from a nurse or doctor who could also counsel them in options to treat their addiction . 
  think about that - instead of paying police to write up a report , go arrest someone ( hah ) , take that person to court , take that person to jail or some `` treatment '' program that hardly ever works ( as they 're forced into it , and do n't really want to change at that point ) , you pay your insurance or for the repair of the car or the deductible , etc , etc , instead we just tell the addict go here , get your drugs , take them there , leave behind the needles in a safe drop box , etc , etc. 
  so much cheaper , and you get a chance to connect with the patient rather than pushing them to dealers who do n't want them to stop . 
  where on earth do you get the idea that fructose is healthier than sucrose ( which is half fructose ) or glucose ( the other half of sucrose ? ) . 
  fructose is processed in your body much like alcohol . 
  if you think alcohol is healthy for you , then yea , i guess you 're right . 
  i 'd rather listen to a [ a doctor ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbnniua6-om ) ( 90 minutes or so ) who explains how sucrose , and specifically fructose , is broken down by your body . 
  a sweet bread dish with warm vanilla pudding . 
  can be served as a main meal , not just as a desert . 
  czech 's have a few dishes that are sweet but can be served as a main - [ potato dumplings with poppy seeds and sugar ] ( http://recepty.vareni.cz/bramborove-sisky-s-makem/ ) are another example , as well as [ zemlb\u00e1ba ] ( http://recepty.vareni.cz/cukrarska-nadychana-zemlovka-zemlbaba/ ) which is a bread soaked in milk , eggs with grated apples and cinnamon . 
  are these the best ? 
  depends what you are in the mood for . 
   i also like [ sv\u00ed\u010dkov\u00e1 ] ( https://www.google.com/search?q=svickova&amp;oq=svickova&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57.1607j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;es_sm=91&amp;ie=utf-8 ) which is your more typical meat/dumplings/cream sauce dish . 
  puhfuckinglease . 
  the guy sounds exactly like a kremlin hire . 
  if you ca n't read his shit and immediately be able to see that the guy is lying , and or specifically pushing the russian government 's line , you should re-read it . 
  well , your complete lack of a counterargument has failed to sway my opinion . 
  thanks for that . 
  well , you have n't really offered a counter argument , aside from `` it 's a bad bet '' . 
  did you do the math ? 
  ( hard to do , considering i did n't give the payout of the bet ) . 
  you seem just to be disagreeing with me , without any reasoning . 
  you 're not making much of an argument for your case . 
  i did n't say he must be gay , i said i 'd bet on it . 
  odds are the reason why he has a problem with gays , to the point of having a problem with a dog doing something that might be perceived as gay , is that he has issues with his own sexuality . 
  it 's not a weird conclusion , considering the amount of times it 's happened before . 
  speaking from personal experience ( my own ) , it 's not unusual for queers or members of the gay/lesbian/bisexual community to lash out at others while they are still in the closet ( many times , in a conflicted state with their own sexuality ) . 
  they project this inner conflict outwards , and demand conformity and extra rules , to `` help '' them deal with their issues , rather than just accept themselves for who they are . 
  we see this a lot with ardent anti homosexuals in the us , who then eventually out themselves via a prostitute or some other such incident ( eg getting caught in airport bathrooms ) .

  this is list in addition , not a total listing . 
  i try not to use any insults or anything of that sort , but i may be blunt sometimes . 
  your argument to mate77 is invalid , since you yourself said `` 50 % of the votes '' . 
  and since you directly contradicted the facts of the reality i had no choice but to consider your biases as the cause . 
  well , better wording would be `` 2nd and soon possibly 3rd best '' . 
  edit : the wiki page is using 2014 data , if you look the 2015 data , all sources will be in concert . 
  the problems with euro are n't immediate , but present themselves over long periods of time . 
  it took greece close to a decade to get truly fucked by the euro . 
  it might take longer for estonia , but lest the mechanisms of the eurozone are improved , it will start making problems almost everywhere outside of germany . 
  i 'm not sure what you mean , our first nuclear power plants started producing power in the 1970s , almost half a century ago . 
  i think his brain just refuses to see reality because it does n't like it . 
   also , no european government is likely to be interested in encouraging having european countries have fragments of their country rip away without buy-in from the parent country plenty of countries have no problem setting this precedent , because they are in fact homogenous countries . 
  and many countries , like the baltics , the czech republic , slovakia , poland , hungary and more have actually national history of being subjugated peoples , and thus will look favourable to catalans because they themselves went through that same process , sometimes with lots of blood shed . 
  again , you present your own opinion as a fact . 
  plenty of countries have * no * problem setting this precedent , because they are in fact homogenous countries -- like denmark . 
  and many countries , like the baltics , the czech republic , slovakia , poland , hungary and more have actually national history of being subjugated peoples , and thus will look favourable to catalans because they themselves went through that same process , sometimes with lots of blood shed . 
  oh , you 're right , the kurdish situation is much more pressing than northern cyprus at the moment , i retract that part . 
  just this year the czech republic has overtaken slovenia in gdp per capita ( ppp ) -- the most important measure . 
  and lithuania and slovakia are getting awfully close -- hence the `` or possibly 3rd '' . 
  yeah i think many eu countries will recognize it as well , i hope mine will in its true spirit -- we have many times been subjugated people ourselves . 
  the second paragraph was just an answer to his question what countries will recognize it . 
  because i do n't think it 's politically and diplomatically feasible to deny the self determination of an ethnic group in western europe today . 
  i might be an idealist , you might be overly pessimistic , only time can tell . 
  also , former spanish colonies might recognize them out of solidarity alone . 
  and transnistria , south ossetia , abkhazia and nagorno-karabakh might recognize them if catalonia reciprocates . 
  ~ ~ and turkey will recognize them if they recognize northern cyprus . ~ ~ edit : it 's not nice to immediatelly downvote people ;-), 
  i do n't think so , i believe many countries * will * recognize catalonia . 
  and if catalonia refuses to pay taxes as a whole , spain will have to react either way . 
  beautiful town , but there are about 100 tourists per meter squared . 
  that 's all true , but that still does n't qualify it as `` great economy '' . 
  great economy countries are the netherlands , the nordics , switzerland , germany , austria , etc. 
  the best you can say about slovenian economy is that it 's 2nd or possibly 3rd best in eastern europe . 
  calais , specifically . 
  the russian army ? 
  that looks pretty close , very promising !, 
  now , what do you think will happen if catalonia declares unilateral independence ? 
  is it possible that the rest of spain will use force ? 
  possibly the armed forces in a show of strength ? 
  because their handling of the possible independence was so far pretty hostile as far as i can tell . 
  i 'm absolutely not saying they `` can not '' , i 'm saying they `` will not '' . 
  they do n't lack a way , they lack a will . 
  because the only thing you can do that will stop hordes that * massively * outnumber any possible border guards is to mow them down with machine guns . 
  which is * absolutely unacceptable * , i hope everyone can agree on that . 
  remember , over 800,000 people will arrive in germany just in 2015 , and maybe twice that next year by the current rate of acceleration . 
  you ca n't arrest them , because you have no place to put them , not enough police vans to carry them , not enough border guards to detain them , not enough handcuffs to restrict them , and no way to deport them . 
  if the entire eu chipped in for proper border control in hungary and possibly slovenia , there would n't be any migrant crisis . 
  alas , politicians are cowards . 
  germany can close it 's borders all it wants , there 's absolutely no chance they will be able to stop the migrants though . 
  they ca n't police the entire length of their borders . 
  if a border guard comes across a few hundred migrants sneaking through some forest or whatever , what can they actually do ? 
  they ca n't shoot them , they ca n't arrest them , because they are too many , they have no way to force them to stay on the austrian side , because they will always be outnumbered and outflanked . 
  the only thing closing of schengen will do is make it harder for eu citizens to travel , it wo n't stop the migrants at all . 
  but it 's all nice in the sand !, 
  all warm and cozy , and you do n't see any uncomfortable things !, 
  which will soon be mostly in europe !, 
  every day our president is far away is a good day !, 
  i 'm right there with you , i do n't think disrespecting millions of chinese wwii victims is an adult response to some minor squabble . 
  so what putin is coming too , grow up . 
  exactly my thinking too !, 
  we could have had a real asset in our president , like the queen is for the british . 
  but instead of an asset , we have an asshat . 
  eh , honestly , he would be a better president than the abomination we have now . 
  turkey can say `` fuck you , you 're not coming back '' , but who cares ? 
  the migrants have n't entered the eu legally either . 
  turkey * can * start shooting them , but then the migrants will hear of that , and probably wo n't decide to take a trip to europe , if they 'll hear that migrants had to actually go back * and * were killed by the turks . 
  it makes me so glad that people-to-people communication ( reddit , twitter , facebook ) is overtaking the curated bullshit of the mass media . 
  they might have controlled people for generations , but it stops now . 
  i would n't even respond such an asshat , it 's not worth it . 
  macedonian army already had to gas the migrants and even had to shoot some rubber bullets iirc . 
  and things will only escalate from here . 
  accidents happen , units have to defend themselves against angry mobs , and so on . 
   to me , this apathy is sickening . 
  the ** major powers in europe caused this mess , through shitty action or through inappropriate inaction ** , they should sort it out . 
  so , damned if they do , damned if they do n't ? 
  are you being serious ? 
  is everything europe 's fault , or just most things in the world ? 
  i see what you did there , our slovak brethren will not be amused . 
  not that i agree with him , but they did kinda disagree with the `` everything should be germany '' issue . 
  ehm , * not at all * . 
  european communities ( ec ) started in 1957 and worked four decades before they were renamed to european union , which worked some years still until schengen was adopted . 
  schengen is not at all necessary and certainly * not * one of the most important values that made eu possible . 
  you 're possibly referring to the free movement of people and goods which the ec was built upon , but that does n't in no way necessitate there be no border checks for illegal immigrants . 
  do you have any source on kurds not being safe in turkey ? 
  i know they have a harder life than other people in the country , but i have n't heard of them being * unsafe * or in danger . 
  what i heard is that they actually provide a significant swing votes in election so they are being courted by the politicians even . 
  exactly . 
  the `` refugees '' want rich germany , not poor eastern europe . 
  immigration is an issue not exactly split along political lines . 
  plenty of leftists are against immigration , and plenty of right-wingers are for it ( because it benefits the companies ) . 
  wow , i never knew you guys had your own writing system !, 
  it looks freaky !, 
  my friend just visited georgia and said you guys do n't have a postal service . 
  is that true ? 
  it 's a bit weird , how do you then deliver official governmental post and stuff like that ? 
  lol , how can you standardize the amount when the prices and wages are so vastly different across the eu ? 
  she has gone full retard . 
  so what is it depiction of ? 
  it looks vaguely like a microsd card , 
  can i ask what flag are you displaying in your flair ? 
  i do n't think the problem is with the woman as much with the journalist that decided to quote that woman .

** triggered **, 
  but why specifically every 50 years ? 
  did someone make some kind of analysis determining that such period is ideal or is it just a meme ? 
  haha germany . 
  pizza, 
  this is cool but i might be too stupid to understand what i am looking at . 
  nevermind lol . 
  every reasonable person knew that long before opening this thread . 
  it 's called projection man . 
   ( nevertheless , some of the stereotypes about roma are still true ), 
  speaking of czechia there is a huge difference , since the expulsion was agreed upon by the powers at the potsdam conference . 
  yet i agree that the so called ` wild deportation ' which took place before the regulated one was pretty inhumane . 
  yep , it 's also in the wiki :  the forty days of musa dagh received much critical praise from austrian and swiss reviewers when the book , over 900 pages long , was published in two volumes in november 1933 . 
  for several months , the novel could be read in nazi germany despite book burnings that included werfel 's previous titles and the increasing number of proscribed jewish authors and their books . 
  in february 1934 , with strong pressure by the turkish government in ankara , the forty days of musa dagh was banned in the third reich . 
  [ 7 ] das schwarze korps , the official newspaper of the ss , painted werfel as an agent who created the `` alleged turkish horrors perpetrated against the armenians '' and also denounced `` america 's armenian jews for promoting in the u.s.a. the sale of werfel 's book . '', 
  the book was also pretty prophetic and widely read among jewish population as they were really able to relate to the armenians . 
  it 's a wonder the book got even published considering nurnberg laws were just around the corner . 
  have n't been to paris in a long time . 
  now i want to visit again . 
  this post will be useful , thank you . 
  if anyone is interested in the armenian genocide , there is a great book by franz werfel called * the forty days of musa dagh . 
  * https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_forty_days_of_musa_dagh how the book was received in nazi germany is also an interesting story . 
  i wish i was a dunedain man . 
  to be honest i think the concept is outdated . 
  i identify much more with people around the world with similar values and beliefs , regardless of their nationality , than with other czechs . 
  i love our history and some aspects of our culture , and i would defend our country if needed , but that 's about it . 
  nationalism is only good for manipulation of masses , because it 's very easy to make everything look like an attack on your nation . 
  he should leave his office like grima did in edoras lol . 
  zeman is denethor confirmed . 
  that would mean that nk courts would hear the dispute arising from the contract , but the governing law of the contract would still probably be german ( depends on agreement between parties or statute ) . 
  also such clause would probably be struck down haha . 
   it asks some interesting legal questions : do contracts that are valid in one country carry any weight in another one that does n't allow them ? 
  there is a whole area of law dealing specifically with this question . 
  it 's called private international law and it 's the most complex and mind blowing set of rules . 
  for eu and family law it is also regulated in the rome iii regulation iirc . 
  do we even have a country subreddit ? 
  edit : just checked . 
  / r/czech is almost exclusively in english . 
  edit2 : wow there is even one in czech . 
  / r/cesky as for content there do not seem to be any strict rules . 
  i love threads like these . 
  so much discussion and so many opinions . 
  throw in some historical references and i 'm entertained for hours . 
  pls guys do n't leave me here . 
  to be fair a huge amount of profit goes back abroad as czechia is basically foreign owned . 
  i see your point though , especially with the ( lack of ) solidarity argument in your previous post , which i unfortunately find true . 
  agreed . 
  yeah it does n't even make sense . 
  i can understand the uk 's reasoning for leaving , but why czechs are so negative is beyond me . 
  great analysis showing the joys of being situated in the region where eastern and western influence meets . 
  however , i do n't see any alternative to the status quo . 
  national state ? 
  that is so 19th century . 
  our future is with germany , what we need is to work on becoming more service based economy and moving up the manufacturing chain . 
  economic crisis , political crisis , security crisis , immigration crisis , putin , erdogan ... 
  certainly not the best times for europe . 
  i ca n't think of anything to get back at you . 
  : / are there any jokes about swiss not including jewish gold ? 
  you even started to beat us in hockey , so ... 
   czech schooling and  the lisbon treaty was a hot topic and the teacher in the civics encouraged us to talk about it does not compute . 
  seriously though , i can confirm that what we were taught was pretty similar ( minus the discussion ) . 
  but as with everything it was more a challenge to remember all the dates and treaties than anything useful . 
  yes , that was the second time we got fucked during that war . 
  we got royally fucked during the 30 years war . 
  bohemia lost the war in 1620 after the [ battle of white mountain ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_white_mountain ) . 
  also 1628 never forget . 
  it was the year bohemia lost its elites and never really got them back . 
  http://www.britannica.com/topic/czechoslovak-history#ref468581  in 1627 ferdinand ii promulgated the renewed land ordinance , a collection of basic laws for bohemia that remained valid , with some modifications , until 1848 ; he issued a similar document for moravia in 1628 . 
  the habsburg ferdinand settled , in favour of his dynasty , issues that had disturbed bohemian public life since 1526 : the bohemian crown ( and consequently the much desired seat of one of the electors of the holy roman emperor ) was declared hereditary in the habsburg family ; no election or even formal acceptance by the estates was required for the succession ; the king had the right to appoint supreme administrators ; in the provincial diets the higher clergy was constituted as the first estate , and all the royal boroughs were represented by one delegate only ; the bohemian diet lost legislative initiative and could meet only upon the king 's authorization to approve his requests for taxes and other financial subsidies ; the king could admit foreigners to permanent residence ; and the use of the german language , in addition to the traditional czech , was authorized . 
  roman catholicism was the sole christian faith permitted . 
  ( the only non-catholics allowed to remain in bohemia after 1627 were jews , who nonetheless faced harsh discrimination . 
  although jews were not numerous in the bohemian lands , prague was home to one of the largest jewish communities in europe . ), 
   royal decrees pertaining to religion granted protestant lords , knights , and burghers the right to choose either conversion or emigration . 
  only about one-quarter of the noble families living in bohemia and moravia prior to 1620 remained ; the majority emigrated to the lusatias ( both annexed by saxony in 1635 ) and silesia , which was the only bohemian province allowed to retain the lutheran confession after the thirty years ' war . 
  many peasants also left the country , though illegally , especially during the rebellion itself . 
  the czechs ' most significant representative abroad was the scholar john amos comenius ( jan \u00c1mos komensk\u00fd ) . 
  the emigrations devastated bohemia and moravia , which may have lost as much as one-half of their population . 
  still , the post was at -4 by the time i replied , only for voicing an unpopular opinion . 
  that 's not how voting is supposed to work . 
  i do n't get why you got downvoted . 
  yeah you are right . 
  there is always the factor of people not acting rationally . 
  haha you know what kind of stuff happens when czechs go renewable . 
  society is unfortunately still in trauma after what happened with solar subsidies and i 'm afraid it 's going to hinder further transition to renewables . 
  where is your flair you fucker ? 
  show us your colors . 
  just few years after the huge amnesty ... 
  i see i worded the previous post poorly . 
  eu does n't regulate prices , but free market does . 
  what i meant was that if you set a price of goods at 1000 eur in germany and 2000 eur in cz then your czech business will go bankrupt since it is easy to buy cheaper in germany . 
  if you set it at 1050 in cz however , customers will balance the 5 % higher price with the inconveniences of buying abroad . 
  the percentage will obviously differ based on the nature of the goods . 
  this is what i meant by the price setting limit . 
  by selling as close to the consumer as possible i meant eventual dispute resolution ( consumers enjoy lots of protection in the eu and you do n't want to have a cross border dispute ) . 
  if you are selling in two countries with free movement of goods ( no fiscal or other barriers ) you will have to set the prices in such manner that it is n't more favourable for a country a consumer to buy the goods in country b. 
  you want to sell as close to the consumer as possible . 
  so you are pretty limited in price setting . 
  the wages pretty much stagnated during the crisis and only recently have started to rise again . 
  still they are pretty shitty imo .

  and last 2-3 years are proving me right . 
  we got ca\u0159ihrad  `` tzar 's castle '', 
  if the turk has no friend but the turk , maybe it is probl\u00e9m of the turk , not the international community ? 
  same goes for russians ... 
   fico is a social democrat ? 
  that 's something new . 
  yeah , he says that , of course . 
  yes  he is great rhetor as you say . 
  he fools many . 
  but what he does , he does for his pocket , his employer ( ever heard of gorilla ? 
  ) , his voting preferences and his image . 
  looks like he is hugely successful , if even in cz people think he does a good things . 
  people in cz dont care about him or anyone else . 
  if you think anyone in this world does something that doesnt profit him , then its time to grow up . 
   you know what almost happened with the courts in pl recently ? 
  there was a big outrage , protests , posts everywhere . 
  well , thing is that in slovakia , things are much worse with courts than in pl could be . 
  fico has his people everywhere . 
  courts , police , procurature . 
  nope  democracy of slovakia is on it 's knees . 
  he may not seem as a dictator to outside world like , for example , orban , but he definitely has grip on this country . 
  nope  i judge by his actions , not by his words . 
  majority of these actions/or inactions are harmful for slovakia . 
  nope, 
  because hundreds of reasons . 
  if you need few obvious points , look at political situation in ex-soviet satelites . 
  everywhere it is way worse . 
  people are stupid and want dictators . 
  the smarter ones want to prosper and have freedom . 
  he mixes both really well . 
  ive never said he isnt asshole , i dont know him personally so i cant tell . 
  my job is connected with politicians and it is their job to negotiate and lie ( not tell full truth ) if needed , so if you find one who will do so , does it make him an asshole , or a good leader ? 
  probably doesnt sound right but everyone with experience in this field will tell you the same, 
  wrong . 
  i am czech so i am better than anyone else by default, 
  i am sure you have seen in on tv , possibly read an article or two about him as well . 
  that doesnt mean you know him . 
  i am not saying he is a good person , i am not here to judge . 
  i just want some people to realize that the way someone is portrayed in the media is not as relevant as his actions . 
  he is a great rhetor and makes social democracy a thing ( which is insanely hard in eastern europe ) without being laughed at ( look at pl , cz , hu , ... ) . 
  he says lot of bullshit ( immigrants , greek crisis , russia , ukraine , and more ) - probably in order to get the votes of the people , but then he proceeds to do the right thing outside and inside his country . 
  you may not agree with his political ideology ( social democracy ) and its fine , but what he does makes sense on a practical level and helps more than it hurts . 
  that is way , way more than your neighbouring countries can offer at the moment . 
  all 4 of them . 
  first they had nothing to do with russia ( no russian army uniforms so who knows , right ? ) . 
  then they were russian volunteers ( just like chinesse volunteers during the korean war ) russia has nothing to do with . 
  then they were russian soldiers on vacation . 
  i am getting lost at how we call russian soldiers that are not officially recognized and are not officially enlisted in russian military budget . 
  my point has nothing to do with reservists or conscription laws ( which are still relevant to your point tho ) . 
  if you let me get into stereotypes a bit : germany is very strictly official and rules-based . 
  everyone knows their role and follows the laws . 
  including the army . 
  you are either a soldier or you are not . 
  but its not like that east to you ( excuse me , frenchies ) . 
  during the ww2 there were guerilla fighters almost everywhere ( my country included ) , especially in russia . 
  after the war , they were celebrated like heroes ( here included ) , until most of them were executed and removed from photographs , because `` we didnt fight for this shit , we fought for freedom , not another dictatorship '' . 
  if you take this into account ( as a slav , i am familiar with this mentality ) - the official numbers dont really mean shit in post-soviet sphere . 
  army included ( as we can see in the past 5 years ) . 
  `` ability to speak does not make you intelligent '' - jar jar binks `` being slovakian does not make educated on slovakian politics '' - burlaczech ( i tried , ok ? ), 
  memes aside , i attended [ descop conference ] ( https://www.vlada.cz/en/evropske-zalezitosti/aktualne/defence---security-conference-prague-156333/ ) where they went into `` details '' of what they plan to do in eu defensive aspects . 
  and guess what , a guy from slovakia said what their country wants to do . 
  but russia has quite a lot `` volunteers '' that took crimmea and fight in ukraine and syria . 
  we do n't . 
  the cooperation and equipment standards harmonisation is already underway , just google a bit . 
  this speech is just a reaction to the eu defense initiative . 
  unpopular opinion is unpopular . 
  * signs a deal to reduce army spending to 2 % gdp * reduces it way below 2 % gdp * complains about having to increase the budget to 2 % gdp how do we even breathe the same air ? 
  maybe you should read a bit more about the topic if you want to sound smart, 
  i assumed it was a good one , but i will stop . 
  because we are life-dependent on exports ( 30 % to germany , 80 % to eu and 65 % to eurozone ) - having same currency will help us so fucking much . 
  not to mention that if euro ( or germany ) crashes , we are dead anyway . 
  there are fuckton of reasons why euro , but for me personally , the travelling ( out or into the country ) , better comparison of prices , labour , statistics ... and more integration in the eu , which we desperately need . 
  the more integrated we are , the less likely we are going to suffer the same fate as pl or hu ( we already are , but to lesser extent and also nobody cares cuz we are small ) . 
  i assume i do, 
  still not getting baited , be less obvious next time, 
  will they learn tho ? 
  their fuckups are keeping my country from entering the eurozone , because we dont wan na pay for their mistakes . 
  i would trust an educated ( in this case , more experienced ) guy on the matters . 
  being a greek doesnt make you an expert on statistics . 
  to be honest , even greek statistians are lying on purpose ( there was a trial last week when their director sent correct data to eurostat , while politicians reported wrong ones and he got sued for that - come on ! ), 
  isnt that the whole idea of eu ? 
  fuck the nationalism and lets put smart people in charge instead , ignoring their nationality ? 
  not saying i am smart enough to be part of eu administration , but i did a lot with statistics during my internships and i can tell you that i know more than 99 % greeks ( czechs as well ) about the matter . 
  `` do you remember that czech guy who was believed more than a greek guy ? 
  yea , that time , the environmental crisis started '' said no one ever , except u/noimira57, 
  did you just assume your regrets ? 
  nobody says it makes a country richer or more developed or anything . 
  but the institution of minimum wage should have a meaning . 
  either remove it completely , or make it high enough so people can actually live off it without getting additional income . 
  did you just assume me checking your flair ? 
  do you think i objectified you ? 
  maybe you should study so you dont have to work for minimum wage ( applies to any country ) ? 
  i finished my university half a year ago and i am doing more than fine ... thanks to myself , i couldnt give a crap whether our minimum wage is 1 or 10 usd since it wont affect me . 
  on the other side , cz minimum wage is increasing yearly and it should be at least twice as high so you can actually live with an appartment and afford food , clothes , transport and culture . 
  howbout you try [ eurostat ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/data/database?node_code=earn_mw_cur ) , since your elstat is garbage and sues their own directors for reporting correct data to eurostat, 
  you cant . 
  who eats the rest ? 
  soldiers in syria ? 
  minimum wage is not really for people living in a big city, 
  and ur french,

  nothing is perfect . 
  one has to choose between minor inconvenience and hordes of completely unknown people roaming around . 
  brussels had screwed it once again . 
  according to recent poll it is 78 % people in the czech republic . 
  they obviously value security over minor delay on the border . 
  a note : [ klaus ' petition ] ( http://www.ceskenoviny.cz/news/zpravy/former-czech-president-klaus-initiates-petition-against-migration/1255025 ) is online one , making it easy target for hackers and jokers . 
  recent similar petition against immigration collected tradictional signatures and managed to obtain 210 thousand of them . 
  it became second the most successful petition in the country , after 1992 petition against dissolution of czechoslovakia ( 600 + k signatures ) . 
  petition was then presented in the parliament but politicians virtually wiped their asses with it . 
  is it * that * hard to provide google translate link ? 
  anyway , here 's english language article about it : http://www.ceskenoviny.cz/news/zpravy/former-czech-president-klaus-initiates-petition-against-migration/1255025 klaus is former president of the czech republic . 
  for whom ? 
  for the czech republic the abovementioned guy ( unsuprisingly ) recommends closing the borders , deportations , higher spending on police and the army . 
  ( remember though , he is * former * top brass , now he does consulting . ), 
  he published large number of articles and blogs about security , some very specific , some general . 
  well , the time will show . 
  btw , [ the guy ] ( https://cs.wikipedia.org/wiki/ji%c5%99%c3%ad_%c5%a0ediv%c3%bd_ ( 1953 \\ ) ) is not official representative of anyone , he is former cos. 
  he is now consultant and does some teaching . 
  during the 1980 's government of the ddr imported vietnamese workers as part of debt clearing . 
  czechoslovakia did the same and , i think , poland and hungary too . 
  they were to work for few years and then return back . 
  after 1991 unified german government did n't allow them to stay , instead gave them money to leave . 
  they did but many of them went into the czech republic where politicians did n't care . 
  since then vietnamese mafias took over lucrative business of smuggling , false brands and drug distribution ( and the very profitable export of drugs into germany ) . 
  yes and he predicts exactly this to escalate further . 
  [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3id0t0/italy_saves_lives_even_if_it_costs_votes_says/cuh9zpb ) is my translation of relevant paragraph . 
  he 's not alone with such scenarios . 
  [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3id0t0/italy_saves_lives_even_if_it_costs_votes_says/cuh9zpb ) is my translation of what he said . 
  he predicted that violence will push refugees into the czech republic [ and has no illusion czech army will be able to stop them ] . 
  quite a few analysts and talking heads predicted similarly dark scenarios . 
  in polls czechs ( as usual ) expect the worst . 
  survival as not heading toward massive violence . 
  few days ago a former czech army chief of staff in an interview predicted exactly this to happen in germany ( and subsequent impact on the czech republic ) . 
  i wish . 
  the very first czechoslovak nuclear power plant was designed and built locally , in late 1950 's . 
  its [ a 1 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ks_150 ) nuclear reactor was capable to use * depleted * uranium . 
  czech lands were once engineering gigant . 
  i would say most czechs give damn about such treaties and what eu thinks . 
  survival is more important than fairy tales . 
  yes , he expects exactly this to escalate . 
  he predicted that this violence will eventually push refugees [ also ] to the czech republic which will be unable to deal with them, 
  several days ago former czech army chief of staff gave an interview . 
  he expects mass violence in germany ( because she will fail to fulfill high expectations of the refugees ) and expects that it will pour across the borders . 
  should there be a giant ice wall around germany we would certainly fear less . 
  [ here ] ( http://www.focus-agency.cz/files/contentfiles/focus-uprchlicka-krize-v-cr-end.pdf ) is recent czech poll on this topic ( pdf in czech language ) . 
  93 % want to deport refugees , 6 % would allow them into europe . 
  i dare to say for us the fair number is ** 0 ** . 
  we do not push our opinion on other countries , however , they are free to do what fits them best . 
  when the empire announced defeat czech politicians immediatelly proclaimed independence . 
  there was no other option on the table , nobody who would prefer to keep it ( at least publicly ) . 
  even if allies wanted to keep it together it woud be impossible , everything what had been attractive on the empire was lost due to its foolishness . 
  i see clear parallels with the eu . 
  czech newspapers by mid 1918 discussed political future w/o caring about the monarchy . 
  it was seen as dead fish . 
  even traditionally sheepish parliament members issued strongly worded proclamations in this sense . 
  put them to boats and point them direction back to turkey . 
  if you ca n't do it you are screwed . 
   seems the more heterogeneous a society or group is the less trusting and giving it is . 
  this was the point of older study by robert putnam . 
  that . 
  austro-hungarian empire fell by exhaustion . 
  by 1918 nobody cared about it any more and one day it simply evaporated . 
   regarding other countries , i think they also might suffer a bit if mass violence will become common in germany it wo n't stop at the border . 
  countries poorly prepared for it , like the czech republic , will suffer . 
   schengen agreement will be in danger , but will endure yesterday slovakia closed its `` green border '' with hungary . 
  guards from ukrainian border were sent there . 
  schengen may simply disappear by thousands of cuts . 
  deport them all back . 
  you could sell all your posessions and sent the money to refugees . 
  i bet nobody will try to stop you . 
  we see germans as fools once again trying to destroy themselves . 
  you should not expect saner nations to join suicidal pact . 
  these statistics certainly include gypsies . 
  i fear the same about czech government . 
  our pm is weakling whose only hope for the future is to obtain cushy job in brussels . 
  last time they refused quotas but agreed to bring in `` voluntarily '' even more refugees . 
  i 'd say it is fitting . 
  it is less about being religious and sexually repressed but more about unwillingness to do crazy experiments with our own society . 
  and few more related news : * about 230 syrians who already asked for asylum in hungary is being released from the camps . 
  they go to germany . 
  [ * ] ( http://zpravy.idnes.cz/dalsi-syrane-opusti-uprchlicka-zarizeni-ffb-/domaci.aspx?c=a150904_090942_domaci_jpl ) * group of refugees attacked guard in one of the camps . 
  he had to be sent to hospital . 
  such incidents are common . 
  migrants would board the train in hungary and go straight to germany , w/o any interference by czech or slovak security . 
  [ * ] ( http://www.novinky.cz/domaci/379696-cesko-muze-vytvorit-vlakovy-koridor-pro-prujezd-migrantu-do-nemecka-tvrdi-chovanec.html ) * on a meeting in prague prime ministers of hungary , poland , czech republic and slovakia refused any attempt to set up mandatory refugee quotas . 
  it was already pronounced as collapsed , yesterday by slovak foreign minister . 
  slovakia just now closed the `` green border '' with hungary ( and sent there security people formerly guarding border with ukraine ) . 
  czech republic was already pressured to take in refugees . 
  initially 70 , later 1,500 . 
  this all in spite of vast majority of people ( 93 % in the latest poll ) being against immigration . 
  i personally prefer leaving the eu , it is utopian organisation for good weather only . 
  if they ask for help it would be up to the states to decide their response . 
  no country , not even the brussels , have privilege to force other countries to do what they do not want . 
  italy has certainly full right to refuse anything what she does n't like . 
  other countries have this right too , they are not slaves of brussels , or at least should not be . 
  not really sure what you mean by this here but czechs do have historical experience of ethnic tensions , violence and attempts to exterminate each other . 
  this is one of the reasons why we do not want to repeat this again . 
  this is straw man . 
  you can bring up ufo 's too . 
  there 's no duty to share suicidal behaviour , not even in the eu .

  what is the poet trying to say by this picture ? 
  if clinton really intended to force no-fly zone in syria it would have been not only about syrian citizens . 
   policy wise , trump is a disaster disaster for whom ? 
  you have better wait to judge . 
  up to now he succeeded to be a political disaster only for clinton . 
  ex post `` scientific '' theories about inevitability of wwi . 
  if princip did not killed ferdinand d'este and ferdinad become the emperor , he would have never started such war . 
  he wanted transform the empire not destroy . 
  princip and whole serbian black hand were the most successfull terrorists befor al-queda and that old man on the throne knew it would be a catastrophe . 
  depends on the exact place , north of prague could be also on best czech soil ( for agriculture ) in polab\u00ed and it shell be prvented if it is intact piece of land . 
  it started 1914 . 
  there are two people that i hate for it : gavrilo princip and franz joseph i. 
  the best links have cdu and spd . 
  see schr\u00f6der , nordstream etc. 
  about 30 000 thousands people dies in street accidents in eu every year and we consider it acceptable toll for traffic and nobody cares about it utill a close person is the victim . 
  ( in the whole world it is more than 1 million a year ), 
  the main reason for their problems is fast growth of population . 
  if the same growth was in europe countries forming eu would have had 2.5 billions of inhabitants , there would have been no eu but powerty and wars . 
  see for example [ rwanda ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/demographics_of_rwanda ) ; from 2.9 millions people in 1961 to 12 millions now . 
  stop blame colonialists for african powerty and wars . 
  colonialism is 60 years old past . 
  we have to send them not guns or wheat but billions of condoms . 
  and who is crossing sea to get in europe ? 
  almost exclusively young men , what would do we here with them ? 
  eu population is 500 millions , it is 6.8 % of the 7.5 billions world population . 
  we are not responsible for the remaining 92 % people . 
  they are responsible for themselves . 
  russia is not going to send anybody in latvia except for standard spies . 
  them they send everywhere . 
  your reply just confirms that left - right classification says nothing . 
  it is only manipulative tool to say who is momentarily `` enemy '' or `` reactionary '' or against something what somebody considers just now `` progress '' `` human rights '' `` social justice '' and similar foggy concepts . 
  left - right classification is meaningless . 
  and especially merkel is an excellent political and ideological eclectic . 
  mentally she is very ambitious pragmatic ; see her `` career '' in fdj . 
  her choice to be a member of cdu seems me to be based more on circumstances and feeling a good opportunity then given by principled conservative beliefs . 
  she shifted cdu far from positions of kohl 's era , not speaking at all about adenauer . 
  but intelligent pragmatic is better then ideological fanatic and she is not so such dehumanized calculating political stagy prostitute as clinton . 
  however having great power long time inevitably changes negatively human mentality , part of her decisions and public behavior demonstrates it . 
  people will feel it step by step and also they will become bored of her . 
  and afd is not a `` far right '' ; adenauer would sign at least 90 % of their program . 
  and migrants that are already in germany are a ticking time-bomb not only because some unknown percent of them are mujahidins . 
  yes there is your history !, 
  hitler is only 12 years of 1000 or more . 
  and frauke petry is not like hitler and afd is not like nsdap . 
  who makes such parallels reall does n't know german history . 
   afd does not have the potential to get # 2 in germany . 
  a year ago everybody laughed from trump . 
   this is up to the voter people vote parties , leaders are selected by parties ( by internal often undemocratic internal fight ) . 
  if the leader is not really terrible , people vote for him because he/she is supported by party . 
  clintona and trump are products of deep political crisis of usa not products of system exchanging after 8 years president . 
  merkel seems to be best because anybody else is prevented to be a serious concurrent by party system and media manipulation . 
  clinton was also presented as a `` safest bet '' and it resulted in trump . 
  clinton is b-class in comparison with merkel but frauke petry is not trump . 
  if afd had significant success in bavaria causing csu not having majority for a single party government with what party csu would make coalition ? 
  after next 4 years merkel 's chancellorship afd could be at least 2nd strongest party in germany . 
  the syrian war is first of all saudis ' and turkish baby fed by americans who all hate asad because he is allied with iran . 
  if rusians did not preveted asad defeat , there would be war between al-qaeda affiliated groups and isis ended by common turkish and saudis intervention and present millions of refugees would be followed by further millions of people living now in asad controlled territory . 
  but this all is not a reason to destroy europe by immigration of millions of people from all states of mena , western africa , horn of africa , afghanistan and pakistan -, 
  regardless any scandals kohl was at power too long ( 16 years ) and merkel would be too . 
  leaders should be exchanged after two 5 years periods . 
  it would besides other things prevent them to suppress potential successors . 
  just opposite , their party would be forced seek intensivelly new leaders having five years for it . 
  it is absurd and very dengerous if a leader is considered irreplaceable . 
  merkel like khol prevents any potential concurrent to get to top of the party or government . 
  she got to top because khol considered her innocuous and she used the scandal to stab him in back . 
  she could be endangered only by similar innocent cunning `` friend '' . 
  but it is a tragedy of german politics , because to let one person run four terms as a chancellor contradict democratic exchange in leadership . 
  it would enforce frauke petry and afd . 
  even the chinese understand now that leaders should be replaced after 10 years . 
   intervention ( direct and indirect ) does have it 's place i thought we discuss here migration and possible move of terrorists in europe using uncontrolled migration flow . 
  to this topic : states must fully control its borders ; it is a principal thing prior to all international rules and treaties touching migrants , refugees or shipwreck survivors . 
  it does n't mean we should not help migrants , refugees or shipwreck survivors . 
  it means that a free passage for this people from coast or eu external border to any european country , like it was last year , is absolutely unacceptable and breaking all rules . 
  it means that we are obliged to help real shipwreck survivors and not people that en masse deliberately risk their life trying to force their way in europe . 
  it means that everybody crossing illegally border should be first placed in a detention facility , examined and only people in serious risk should get asylum . 
  if this was practiced from the beginning no huge migration wave would be running over europe . 
  it means that european help should be provided to refugees in first safe countries , because it is much more efficient . 
  potential and real terrorist are important but only small part of the mass immigration problem . 
  the main problem is that multicultural visions are obviously dangerous nonsense . 
  to interventions : just american experiences and libya or syria give very hard lessons and bosnia too . 
  we have to keep in mind srebrenica . 
  we have to take only commitments that we are able , willing and ready to fulfill . 
  it is a crime to promise people protection and after they rely on it let them being murdered . 
  and any intervention in muslim states is very questionable because all their sects and tribes are in agreement in one thing that is opposition to west . 
  and all alleged western allies only use western help and resources for their own goals . 
  leftist `` idealism '' is very dangerous because it is mostly immature vision of world feeded by personal frustration and deprivation packed as a rational ( even `` scientific '' ) teaching . 
  effort `` making world better '' performed by leftist idealists led to catastrophes like bolsheviks ' rule in eastern and central europe . 
  there are 7.5 billions of people in the world . 
  about 500 millions of them live in eu . 
  it is less then 7 % . 
  they ca n't be responsible for the remaining 7.1 billions . 
  of course we have to help , but self destruction is not help . 
  it was not about politics only . 
  if you wanted any better job or even a manger position , you had to be member of the communist party . 
  communist czechoslovakia had 1,5 millions members of the communist party , it was 10 % of population . 
  if it was in western city it would have been a piece of art explained as an important prophecy . 
   juncker : `` we have to teach the new president of the usa ... '' juncker should undergo a therpy ... 
   prosinec in czech prosinec is december but it is from proso ( panicum miliaceum ) . 
  commie ? 
  czech names of moths are old slavic names related mostly to nature ( weather , blooming of various plants ) or human activities related to nature .

too soon even for bismarck, 
  i think he meant the migrants cherry-picking the destination ? 
  but we do n't have another 700 years to wait . 
  cheap cigarettes , apparently, 
  the phonemic inventory of the language is , overall , a bit different as everything is more palatalized . 
  back in the 90s ( when i was growing up ) we had plenty of slovakian shows on tv but lately there are practically none and the incentive to watch slovakian tv exclusively is gone . 
  today there are many slovakian students in the czech universities but they usually immerse themselves and eventhough they still speak slovakian , their accents shift ( at lest in my experience ) . 
  as a czech youngster you will run into an enormous amount of the slovak language online ( as many games etc. 
  have cz/sk communities ) but the amount of people familiar with the spoken word goes down . 
  however , i think that if they get into contact with some slovaks they can still adjust in no time . 
  thanks , i 'm gon na correct the post , it 's capitalized in english and i did n't think about it when translating . 
  the czech republic consists of 3 historical regions . 
  bohemia , the western region . 
  moravia , the south-eastern part . 
  and lastly , the czech part of silesia . 
  silesia as a region spreads also to poland and germany . 
  so simply calling it bohemia invokes the czech word * \u010cechy * , which is the czech name , again , for only the western half of the country . 
  czechia is the agreed equivalent of the czech word * \u010cesko * . 
  the suffix * - sko * is a common suffix for country names . 
  for example , russia , your country , is simply called * rusko * , the root * rus * + * - sko * . 
  * \u010cesko * is often used as a name for the whole region , it was also used in the name of czechoslovakia , * \u010ceskoslovensko * . 
  many , myself included , accept czechia because it is simple and natives often use its equivalent , * \u010cesko * , in normal speech . 
  although , many , myself again included , find it weird-sounding and hesitate to use it themselves . 
  czechlands is sometimes also used , although , the term is incorrect and has no basis in the native language . 
  its equivalent , * zem\u011b \u010cesk\u00e9 * , is used when speaking of the historic regions , often meaning literally bohemia + moravia + silesia . 
  it is very close to the term * zem\u011b koruny \u010cesk\u00e9 * , the lands of the czech crown , which is mostly used in connection with the old kingdom of bohemia , former part of the hre . 
  some people , mainly natives with low english proficiency , use phrases like : `` here in czech , we ... '' . 
  this is outright wrong and should not be used . 
  phonetically it is ok but gramatically it is only a shortcut for people to get their message through . 
  some english-speaking people might accept it but it probably sounds weird . 
  the czech republic , the full name , probably sounds too complicated or exhausting to use over and over again , however , the equivalent * \u010cesk\u00e1 republika * is often used even in the native tongue . 
  it is something that is correct in 99 % of the situations you might bump into . 
  in written word , i 'd recommend using this term , possibly shortening it to the czech rep. , as it is the most fool-proof and will always sound right . 
  i ca n't say anything positive about them since they bombed the boston marathon . 
  i 'd not hold being religious against them though . 
  it 's just something that always comes to my mind when thinking of poles and it is something they really differ in compared to the czechs . 
  as to the first part . 
  the thing is , it goes waymore back than the communism era ( eventhough it is said that the government was much more brutal when repressing religion over here ) . 
  religious wars had always been a huge part of czech history . 
  that 's because it 's twisted by the media . 
  you only hear of negative things like poor quality imported food etc. 
  but overall , i 'd still rate the poles as one of the closest to us . 
  leaving religion out of the equation that is . 
  poor wording i guess ? 
  maybe  they prefer eastern europeans , especially poles , to other types of migrants . 
  is n't poland already harboring like hundreds of thousand ukrainians ? 
  what is negative about not taking any more ? 
  it sucks but you ca n't help all and opening the flood gates will probably lead to even more problems . 
  the next parliamentary elections are 2017, 
  it 's the machine 's fault . 
  forcing people to ask why we 're lazy . 
   was invaded 1968 never forget < 3 < 3 romania, 
  the unemployment in certain areas and professions is so low that companies are often unable to expand because they would end up understaffed and the investments would take too long to return . 
  are you seriously stating that the far right is the nazis and concetration camps while forgetting what the far left did to the eastern bloc ? 
  or do you think we just got fed up with all the social security and overthrown the regimes to hate on brown people ? 
  what ? 
  wikipedia tells me 1.5 mil turkish citizens in 2013 . 
  what are you on , dude ? 
  that 's what ? 
  1mil votes at best ? 
  i can see sanders not catering to the average american . 
  the europeans should know better though . 
  the number of people in europe who think clinton would be a good president is too damn high . 
  families and having children should be supported . 
  with that i agree so i would n't change that . 
  but the state should make it impossible for one to make a living making children . 
  even more so when there 's that low of a chance they will become productive members of society . 
  offer welfare for up to two kids . 
  no extra money for more kids unless born twins etc. 
  offer free sterilization . 
  that 's my politically incorrect solution . 
  a true masterpiece . 
  interesting information for many people might be the fact that smetana composed vltava ( and many other pieces ) when completely deaf . 
  more interestingly , the period short after he had lost hearing in his second ear is one of his most productive . 
  edit : my intention is not to overshadow the genius of smetana but foreigners might be more familiar with the work of another great czech composer , [ anton\u00edn dvo\u0159\u00e1k ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tglonixbg8u ) . 
  the new world symphony is the first symphony ( that we know of  ) to land on the moon , as neil armstrong took a recording of it on the apollo 11 mission . 
  i chose to post this under the previous czech entry . 
  nah , we 'll become ireland instead, 
  it 's only because their low military organization did n't allow them to move into pagan territories without suffering high attrition in 966 . 
  possibly . 
  depends on what else would settle in . 
  ketchup is the cheap variant , some vendors put custom sauce on it , usually tomato based as well though . 
  i thought you were always hungary ^ ^ sorry, 
  what i meant is that the street vendors will often use cheap yoghurt or put cheap ketchup on it instead of making some sauce etc. 
  wow , that looks really good !, 
  i 've never really liked oily food , i might try the baked version at home, 
  i knew it was brought here , i just did n't know where from . 
  how it it in hungary ? 
  here it 's mostly made from cheap ingredients right on the street . 
  is it made differently in hungary ? 
  also not actually a pizza and i 'm not sure whether it 's specific to czech republic . 
  [ lango\u0161 ] ( http://www.lifestylemagazin.cz/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/lango%c5%a1e.jpg ) fried dough , often garlic flavoured , with sauce and cheese , various other topings , like yoghurt , may be used as well it 's a typical cheap street food edit : hungarian origin, 
  oh , i know that the old macedonia was hellenic . 
  i just thought they were more disconnected from the city states . 
  it was just my wrong perception . 
  for some reason , the ancient hellas was south of athens and delphi + crete . 
  but hey , my knowledge of ancient greece is 90 % documentaries and video games , i 'm not surprised there are inaccuracies . 
  the question i was trying to raise was : `` would alexander consider macedonia hellas ? '', 
  was is something like `` the land of hellenic people '', 
  even when macedonia was around ?

  i 'm usually very glad there are n't more czechs on reddit or elsewhere on the english-speaking internet , because then i can pretend that we do n't have these pathetically provincial people around . 
  then again , perhaps that 's why they completely lack a worldview encompassing a larger area than 100km from their house , maybe it 's a chicken-and-egg situation ... 
  that 's not really surprising when they 're like , what , a third of all cars on our roads . 
  not me i 'm not !, 
  i like history , computer games , non-fiction li ehh fuck it why do i even try . 
  i guess i * could * pretend to be a tourist and only speak english . 
  that could be an interesting excercise , if only it were n't something a total psycho would do . 
  so you guys are telling me i have to go abroad to meet our girls during the mating season . 
  great . 
   is n't communism a forbidden word in czechia like in the rest of former eastern bloc ? 
  not really , it was specifically decided not to ban the party , to give them a chance to transform . 
  its voters are mostly the elderly who reminisce about the good old socialist times , you wo n't see many advocates for world revolution there . 
  to put it bluntly , i think it 's not too far-fetched to expect them to die out with the old generation . 
   here in prague well , there 's your problem . 
  judging by the amount of slovaks at our universities , we wo n't have to , they 'll all move here anyway sooner or later . 
  the population of czechoslovakia in the area of the czech republic , that 's efficiency . 
  yeah , it gets old fast . 
  now get me the pizza , corrupt mario . 
  in wwii the americans stopped at plze\u0148 ( as they agreed with the soviets ) , leaving the rest of the country to be liberated by the soviets . 
  these people are expressing their opinion that had they not stopped and had czechoslovakia not gotten into the eastern sphere of influence , the following 40 years would have been different . 
  i have no idea where they got that number , but there 's no way in hell that 70 % of the population is against the convoy . 
  they literally said the same thing in a previous [ article from 2009 ] ( http://www.pressenza.com/2009/03/the-czech-govt-has-fallenx-a-victory-for-democracyx-disarmament-and-nonviolence/ ) , which was about a permanent military installation , a completely different issue . 
  surely there would be a lot more people than 1500 on the biggest square in the whole country if 70 % percent were against . 
  meh , i do n't think austria can take any credit for that . 
  if anything , austria started industrializing way too late . 
  take that , von habsburgs . 
  i 've said this somewhere before , but if you want to ruin a perfectly fine evening , just ask someone from the former eastern bloc about 20th century history . 
  it 's so frustrating to see stats like these . 
  and you 're not allowed to ever forget it , either . 
  oh , you 're from that eastern european country , right ? 
  you 're slavs , well surely you are basically russians . 
  were n't you part of the soviet union ? 
  and all the english teachers from america back in high school seemed to see themselves as missionaries , spreading civilization to the poor , wild east . 
  it 's just ... sad . 
  what are you even talking about ? 
  even in 1950 , czechoslovakia was comparable to any other western country in terms of gdp . 
  then it went completely to shit . 
  the country will never get those 40 years of stifled growth back . 
  i see you want the world to know just how subtle and romantic latvians are . 
  yeah i 'm sure that 's it . 
  what 's your problem with czechia ? 
  it 's perfectly fine in other languages , our own included , so why exclude english . 
  i swear you guys just pulled place names out of a hat when you assigned them . 
  best metric as far as i 'm concerned . 
  always liked this one : how did czechoslovaks find out that the earth was round ? 
  they took a dump on the west and shit came from the east . 
    any of you wave you 're countries ' flags from your home or have flag bumper stickers on your cars ? 
  that 'd be weird . 
  i do n't need to tell other people in sweden that i 'm swedish . 
  this is interesting , because i 've been to dalarna not too long ago , so a pretty rural area with very few non-swedes i 'd say , and it seemed like every house had a swedish flag on it . 
  thought it was weird , precisely for the reason you wrote . 
  just got two of them today from an atm in vienna , had n't even noticed the difference . 
  whoa , you can really read between the lines , ca n't you . 
  i merely said that to point out that it would n't be the first time that convenience trumped ideology . 
  who the fuck are you by the way ? 
  what compels you to shill so hard in this entire thread ? 
  i mean , it 's not like the purity-obsessed nazis had trouble dealing with the japanese , is it ? 
  it 's quite funny that this was your example . 
  well that 's of course the thing - i do n't think we will have those problems . 
  there 's a reason we do n't have them now , and it 's not because of the nationalistic fervor of dutiful czech citizens , which i simply think is out of proportion considering the threat to our way of life or whatever . 
  not sure how important this is , but the question asked was n't about staying in the eu , it was about whether you would vote for entry into the union in the hypothetical scenario that we were n't already there . 
  anyway , this is tough for me . 
  on the one hand , the hysteria in our country about this issue ( that i think has so far been a non-problem for our country specifically ) seems ridiculous to me , on the other hand , most of the people clearly disagree with me and i ca n't see how i could change that . 
  it 's frustrating . 
   and i am not old . 
  if you went to school in czechoslovakia , you 're over 30 . 
  by reddit standards , you might as well be a fossil . 
  if there is any animosity against austrians here , it 's about this . 
  the protests , blockades of border crossings and such . 
  i guess i do n't really see what the big deal is about . 
  are there also austrian protests against nuclear power plants in slovakia , hungary or slovenia ? 
  no kidding , a solid third of my uni classmates were slovaks . 
  not many returning to their home country either . 
  i wonder if that 's already becoming a problem . 
  if you can spare a few minutes , his [ new year 's address ] ( http://old.hrad.cz/president/havel/speeches/1990/0101_uk.html ) from 1990 , only weeks after the fall of the communist government , is worth reading . 
  what 's quite amazing is how in your view this is somehow europe 's doing . 
  as if the turks were devoid of agency . 
  would n't the [ lands ruled by wenceslas iii . 
  ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/81/wenceslausiimap-cs.png/1024px-wenceslausiimap-cs.png ) be the greatest extent ? 
  i know it 's technically three kingdoms under a personal union , but then again , brandenburg or austria were also separate lands , just ruled by the same ruler as bohemia . 
  in case you do n't recall or ca n't read a few posts up , you stated that our ancestors fighting the ottomans a couple hundred years ago was somehow a reason to be wary of muslims . 
  i claim that using the ottomans to justify being wary of muslim immigrants or refugees is moronic and shows you know nothing about history , but sure , deflect some more . 
  well no , my point was , is there actually anyone claiming otherwise about mozart ? 
  unless there are some hardcore salzburger separatists around that i have n't noticed . 
  i 've heard this said about beethoven , sure , but why would n't austria claim mozart ? 
  what are you on about , how were the austrians any better with the forced recatholicization and germanisation of czechs . 
  i 'm sure that was a fully equal relationship . 
  besides , the point was n't that ottomans were great , it 's that they were n't even shitty in the way you want them to . 
  they were n't a big bad theocracy hell-bent on spreading islam , just another imperial power with its own political ambitions . 
  etymology checks out . 
  my ancestors also encountered the swedes in the thirty year 's war ( you know , an * actual * religious war ) , as they burned and pillaged their way across central europe . 
  do n't seem to be wary of protestants . 
  taking a multi-ethnic empire that was in general more tolerant to its religious minorities than its christian european counterparts and trying to connect it to today 's islamic extremism is a crime against history . 
  there 's a legitimate debate to be had here , but people who try to take the historical angle usually just end up looking [ ridiculous ] ( https://cdn.i0.cz/public-data/55/1d/09bec2923bc8a85edf7bd3f5817b_w1200_h800_gd63ca2ea8d4a11e5b6cc002590604f2e.jpg ) ... 
  well duh ... that 's the whole point of stealth . 
  stupid sentimental value is exactly what i would call it . 
  if you do n't like the name , that 's obviously fine , but do n't pretend to have a reason other than habit or your subjective opinion of how it sounds , in which case do n't presume to speak for ` us czechs ' . 
  and do n't get me wrong , i dislike zeman as much as the next guy , but surely you ca n't seriously believe the reason for this change is him being drunk , so i * do * wonder why you are triggered . 
  eh i guess it depends , you said you were in falun and it 's not surprising that in such a small city and in common housing the erasmus people stick together more , sometimes literally . 
  i was in vienna and in bigger cities there 's way more to do besides erasmus parties .

  if trump does something good - show it . 
  if trudeau does something bad - show it . 
  call out the bullshit and call out the lies . 
  that 's all that it takes to be trustworthy . 
  would they report on fake news spread by the left as well ? 
  debunk the myth of how the recent wave of refugees is helpful to the economy ? 
  if so , it 's a great idea . 
  if not , it 's yet another leftist circlejerk . 
  one of the poorest and least relevant countries in europe . 
  friends of russia . 
  extremely corrupt government . 
  the beaches are not bad apparently . 
  well it is true in part . 
  there are many extremely dangerous neighborhoods in france , especially paris . 
  the only equivalent in czech republic are the roma ghettoes . 
  read some actual research : https://www.oecd.org/slovakia/41029725.pdf also remember that slovakia is still very cheap despite the euro . 
  on the other hand switching will help fight against our shitty supermarkets which try to sell products at prices higher than in the west - comparing them would be a lot more easy . 
  if `` non-eu '' means refugees then all of them are against it , thankfully . 
  any politician who dares to support illegal immigration will be voted out ruthlessly . 
  ano supports whatever is good for agrofert . 
  if the conditions are right babis will support the eu . 
  if not he wo n't . 
  the idea that the euro causes prices to increase is false . 
  nobody can explain why it would happen and none of the euro adapters actually saw statistically significant increases in pricing after the transition . 
  yep , that 's the guy . 
  funnily enough an austrian citizen almost beat him in the elections . 
  possible solutions : 1 . 
  shift political institutions to depopulated areas . 
  move the european parliament to budapest rather than keeping it in brussels . 
  this will also help eastern eu states feel closer to the eu politicians . 
  offer more infrastructural investment : the entirety of the eu should be connected by high-speed rail , with trains leaving every hour from paris to sofia ( a bit exaggerated , but you get the point ) . 
  every member state should have excellent roads , excellent public transport , attractive public areas , etc. 
  invite * european * immigrants to move to depopulated areas without significant restrictions : ukrainians , russians , belorussians , moldovans . 
  we could also do more to attract people from japan , usa , canada , australia , new zealand and other well-developed regions . 
  right now it takes the same amount of effort to move to germany as it does to bulgaria , so most people do n't bother moving there . 
  we 'll send them all to trappist-1 . 
  their parents ' taxes paid for their education already . 
  why should they pay extra now ? 
  obviously they 'd have to cut away the money from the budget to allow those wages , as money does n't grow on trees . 
  but it will pay back eventually after poland 's academic results improve . 
  sadly , it 's relatively easy for the government to spend a few hundred million euros to pay for a new campus , but hard to give a grant of the same size to support decent salaries . 
  well , obviously they can be a bit lower since living expenses are lower in poland . 
  but they absolutely have to be high enough that moving to germany does n't improve one 's income . 
  politicians do n't seem to understand this . 
  until university salaries are as high as they are in the west there will be brain drain , especially among top talent . 
  spending money on laboratories and better equipment alone wo n't cut it . 
  the v4 governments need to bite the bullet and start paying decent salaries ( by western standards ) to their phd 's , post-grads and professors . 
  obviously the above only applies to stem disciplines . 
  butthurt much ? 
   in 2006 romenians had higher rates for murders , rapes , vehicle thefts and robberies than other migrants . 
  i do agree that the 2007 eu expansion was a mistake ... 
  what is your solution then ? 
  let those pieces of shit destroy the european civilization ? 
  wait until the angry mob decides to take justice into their hands ? 
   so you deport in morocco people that probably never lived there . 
  only criminals . 
   and you think morocco would just let you do that ? 
  for a bribe ( `` investment '' ) , yes , probably . 
   what do you do if morocco changed its nationality law in response ? 
  see above - bribe them or threaten to boycott them at eu level . 
  one stroke of a pen and they 're not longer dutch citizens ... 
  only 15 % of dutch citizen have a non-western background , while 50 % of all prisoners are non-western immigrants ...  `` 65 % of all boys of moroccan origin aged between 12 and 23 years have been detained at some time ; the figure among all boys of antillean origin is 55 % '' why are n't all moroccan 's deported then ? 
  literally more than half of them are criminals . 
  the protest is in the form of voting for pvv . 
  something tells me rotterdam is n't exactly the safest dutch ( is it even dutch at this point ? ), 
  city ... 
   that person had to go to constitutional court to have the right . 
  kind of sucks for them but they do have that right now , which was the goal . 
  i 'd say it counts . 
   so i do n't get why it 's not marriage when it 's so close then to appease the idiots . 
  you tell them there 's no `` gay marriage '' in czechia while in reality it exists under a different name . 
  austerity is also a good opportunity to remove useless regulations and open up the economy for business , not just for slashing social security benefits . 
  it 's 100 % full marriage except for joint adoption . 
  literally no other difference except for the name . 
  there is gay marriage in czech republic , but it 's called `` registered partnership '' . 
  it is literally the same in all aspects ( adoption has been legalized in 2016 ) . 
  i 'm afraid eventually the chinese will just copy all of germany 's innovations and stop buying their products . 
  it 's already happening under our own nose when the chinese `` invest '' in european companies , while in reality their only goal is to export the technology asap back home and shut down the european competitor . 
   building houses possibly , but german people will only benefit from those houses when the refugees are deported , and who knows when ( if ever ) that 's going to happen . 
  until then they 're mostly used by non-germans . 
  and even when the refugees are deported it remains to be seen if former refugee centers can be repurposed for ordinary citizens . 
   training more police well , if the refugees were n't there , there would n't be a need for more police . 
  same as digging holes . 
  the local crime rate is a lot lower than it is for mena immigrants , so obviously the need for more police is a self-perpetuating problem . 
   if you raised hartz 4 most money would be spend on consumption fully agreed !, 
  it would 've been much wiser to spend the money on locals rather than refugees . 
  however that 's besides the point . 
  well , give me a link to a direct answer then . 
  i fail to see it . 
  a day later , still no direct answer ... 
  make austria-hungary great again !, 
  wasting resources on foreigners benefits germany just as well as breaking windows in every german house and then building the infrastructure to replace them . 
  where ? 
  i can not see a direct answer . 
  the thread failed to answer why supporting refugees is better for the economy than digging holes and filling them back up . 
  then they 're fucked . 
  what the mongols failed to achieve in the 14th century will be completed by the refugees ... 
  money is n't magical , for example nobody can replace the gas and oil spent on the refugees as we have a limited quantity of them . 
  op is using the good old broken windows fallacy . 
  ah , yes , the good old broken windows theory ...

   you think that pl young generation is not conservative towards lgbtq ? 
  i meant , that it 's getting better ( even in conservative poland ) and reffered to our situation ( in cz ) , where young people are much more open in regards to lgbtq in comparison to older generations . 
  he is probably referring to high scores regarding pisa and other rangings , were poland is showing good results . 
  so , there is hope . 
   young generation seems super hardcore conservative to me not towards lgbtq , at least not here . 
  regarding populism , yes they are more susceptible as many need to still shape their opinions by further education and experience . 
  one day poland , one day !, 
  exactly !, 
  my parents decided , that they wo n't baptize us ( me and my brother ) and wo n't influence us in what we should believe . 
  they let such decisions on us when we have grown up . 
  for some reason , i ca n't even look at this monstrous person, 
  hopefully , more countries will follow to grant rights to their own citizens . 
   our country is just too crowded with old , demented conservative ~ ~ s ~ ~ politicians i feel this pain, 
  this , other main factors were : habsburgs were devoted catholics . 
  prague and bohemia were one of the reformation centres . 
  czech nobility was often rebellious against the rulers . 
  on the other side , south ( austria ) was traditional , catholic and obedient . 
  there was new thread in the north : prussia , while the main thread in the south : ottomans weakened and began to withdraw . 
  dunabe basin became safe ( both , from ottomans and prussia ) and well connected to habsburg regions of interest . 
  ca n't imagine how it had to feel when people were forced to certain boxes , especially as a school kid . 
  it was like selection process , which in some cases decided your fate . 
  horrific . 
  kind of scary when you put parallels to tody 's populist scaremongering . 
  golden age of prague was between the 14th to 16th century , when it was one of the major european cities . 
  the centre of the empire moved to the south to danube basin , to vienna . 
  while vienna was growing , prague was in decline . 
  it started to grow again in 19th and early 20th century , especially as the capital city of the newly declared czechoslovakia . 
  do n't forget estonia ( 1.317.797 ), 
  was there hostility between bosnians and croats before the wars ? 
  or was it fueled by nationalists when yugoslavia was dissolving ? 
  the two fighting were drunk , but the two placing bagels on that guy 's head , did n't seem very drunk . 
  they were sober enough to know what they do . 
  there is shortage of labour in denmark , germany , czechia and other eu countries so skilled workers are welcomed . 
  i meant , that some uk citizens might be into relocation into the eu , so the office might help them with that . 
  ireland it stronk !, 
  benelux and ba-w\u00fc stronk !, 
  central bohemia and southern moravia going up . 
  northwest region , what a loser . 
  stop mining coal and go to lab . 
  they should open office in the uk , some might be into relocation, 
  i thought it 's icelandic `` yearbook photo of bj\u00f6rk '' and her portrait as a wolf, 
  \u010cevap\u010di\u010di i was wondering where it came from, 
  lack of education and self-reflect ? 
  yes , it was shock to see it destroyed . 
  wonder if both part of the city bosniak/muslim and croat , improved their relations with each other . 
  companies wo n't present it from obvious reasons : the aim is to mislead consumers and save money by using cheaper ingredients , while pretending to be the same product across the border . 
  it 's not directly breaking eu safety regulations etc , but it 's immoral practice . 
  these companise profit from eu common market , while using the fact that certain norms are not yet implemented . 
  in the usa , the product is the same in california as well as in texas . 
  here , it pretends to be the same product ( same producer , indistinguishable package , etc. 
  ) , while containing something else . 
  either , they use proper packaging to make it distinguishable or they use the same product ingredients when selling in the eu . 
  i think people gather forces . 
  then you need politicians to stand behind it and force it further . 
  we are talking about multinational corporations like unilever , danone , heinz , . . they wo n't admit anything and they have army of experts and lawyers . 
  that 's why it 's brought up in eu to make awarness about this problem and unfair behaviour . 
  sea , lovely towns , ex-yugoslavian country , they have euro , seems to have good relations with other balkan countries , mountains , kotor, 
  here is full [ report ] ( http://data.idnes.cz/soubory/ekonomika/a150703_hro_012_zvrenzprvaproahold.pdf ) for instance , but it 's in czech ( srn means germany , \u010cr - czechia , n - there is significant difference , s - no significant difference ) lucheon meat from tulip ( always same products ) : german one contaided pork meat , czech one leftover chicken meat rama from unilever : german one contained 70 % of fat , czech one 60 % of fat ice tea lemon from nestea : german one was sweetened with sugar , czech one with fructose and steviol-glycoside . 
  czech one also contained 40 % less of tea extract fish fingers from iglo : czech one had 7 % less meat than german one ... 
  that has nothing to do with liberal eu , that is driven by money and cheating for certain corporations, 
  i have a simple solution , do n't buy products labeled with eastern european languages only ( because , that one is intended to be shitty by global/pan-eu corp. ) . 
  buy products where is also german , dutch , italian ... so you know it 's not intended as second-class product . 
  to have alps on 62 % of total area helps, 
  i vote for one of them this year . 
  in general , we lack truly modern , inclusive and ambitious party here in cz . 
  many politicians we have there currently , have to go . 
  i 've hopes for the future due to generational change . 
  omg are they wasted ? 
  we need to get pirates and greens to parliament . 
  that would be great !, 
  ano and top 09 dislike each other , so this combination is very unlikely, 
  let 's make it beneczelux !, 
  sounds italian actually ( bonus feature ), 
  i need to browse r/aww for an hour at least after seeing these yokels, 
  ods hit bottom hard in 2013 after their coalition government failed miserably due to corruption scandals , incompetence and complete loss of trust . 
  kdu\u010csl is unfortunately on the rise after years of weak results . 
  they are countryside chrisitan party , so social progress is not on their agenda . 
  they protest regularly against prague pride for instance . 
  yes , and they have n't reformed . 
  especially old people love them . 
  ahah \u0160vejk depicted what a-h meant for czechs : backward monarchy, 
  really ? 
  i believe , those who wanted to leave are already long gone . 
  unless , she means invasion of pensioners . 
  people who are butthurt by caricature will have it hard in life, 
  love it !, 
  i thought , that istanbul would be in chp colours . 
  poland is leg eater . 
  both germany and russia lost their legs there . 
  turkey is beheading itself . 
  it seems , that self-destructive behaviour is an old phenomena there . 
  netherlands just chilling with weed . 
  nicely drawn map . 
  it 's tip of the iceberg . 
  this guy is a good example , but many nazis and their descendants are not this willing of self-reflection . 
  * `` while waiting to escape to argentina , where many other nazis had already found safe refuge . 
  he was administered the last rites by austrian bishop alois hudal , one of the main churchmen involved in rescuing nazis from allied justice '' * hiding in south america , stolen art , collaborating priests it was almost like following manual for many nazis . 
  vltava is heading to elbe and further to germany .

  czech republic can only envy . 
  authorities here are passive and no low quality school has been ever closed by them . 
  the most infamous is law faculty in public university in city of plze\u0148 . 
  ( [ short overview in en ] ( http://blisty.cz/art/51719.html ) . ), 
  they literally sold dozens to hundreths of diplomas to politicians , mafiosi , police officers and celebrities . 
  it became major scandal few years ago but at the end nobody got punished , almost no fake diplomas were annulled and the faculty still operates as if nothing had happened . 
   bulgaria , along with the czech republic , finland , hungary and slovakia , are all home to nuclear reactors that are 100 percent dependent on russian nuclear fuel . 
  in the 1990 's , during construction of [ new nuclear plant ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/temel%c3%adn_nuclear_power_station ) , czech republic switched to westinghouse control technology and fuel , mid-project . 
  this contributed to years of delay and massive cost overuns ( slovakia stuck with original system and had no such problems ) . 
  the fuel rods turned out to be problematic and after decade of troubles the power station switched to russian fuel contractor . 
  the world is widely known ( and used ) but it is not e.g. 
  in the most official czech language [ dictionary ] ( http://ssjc.ujc.cas.cz/ ) made online in 2011 .

  ** czech republic ** * last december a man with total memory loss was [ found in oslo ] ( http://www.thelocal.no/20140408/man-found-in-oslo-with-no-memories ) . 
  norwegian police now aborted investigation of this case . 
  contrary to earlier news he was not robbed , drugged or raped . 
  he is a czech , has debts and is not willing to pay them . 
  his current location is unknown . 
  * in 1995 czech republic bought 72 [ l-159 alca ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/aero_l-159_alca ) planes for over 50 billion czk . 
  the machines were not needed and most never left the storage . 
  now the government sold first 14 planes ; they will end up as a flying targets for us air force . 
  the whole batch of 28 planes will be sold for 25 million usd ( ~ 0,5 billion czk ) . 
  * czech army has almost no ammunition , said its chief of general staff . 
  years of cuts and massive corruption ( see above ) left the army bled dry . 
  * there is no end of disastrous news about the smart-card project for prague public transportation . 
  corruption infested project which is likely to be abandoned soon consumed so far over 1,35 billion czk ( ~ 50 million euro at current rate of exchange ) . 
  now the company developing it asks prague for another 40 million czk ( ~ 1,5 million euro ) as licence fees . 
  return to traditional paper travel vouchers was estimated to cost 16 million cz ( ~ 600k euro ) . 
  * vat tax on medicaments , books and food for toddlers will be lowered to 10 % ( from 15 % ) , since 2015 . 
  * a court annuled contract between the state owned biggest health insurer and a [ proton therapy center ] ( http://www.proton-cancer-treatment.com/ ) in prague . 
  the 2006 contract ( valued ~ 550 milion euro ) was * very * profitable for the privately owned center and was pushed through by a corrupt health minister ( who now stands before the court for unrelated crime ) . 
  * [ supreme audit office ] ( http://www.nku.cz/en/default.htm ) found that an expensive database of state owned properties is not used at all . 
  the system cost 254 million czk ( ~ 9,5 million euros ) . 
  * last year czech government fell down due to a scandal . 
  secretary and mistress of the prime minister ordered secret service to spy on prime minister 's lawful wife . 
  three accused directors of the secret service were now let free . 
  the court argued that `` they were not aware they broke the law '' . 
   how do you plan to travel from italy to norway without cash , hmm ? 
  if you settle for germany [ italian authorities will give you ticket to hamburg and some cash ] ( http://www.voxeurop.eu/en/content/news-brief/3821061-germany-accuses-italy-pushing-illegals-north ) . 
  the stereotype is quite real . 
  the income/price level ratio is more important . 
  a colleague of mine worked on an engineering project in belarus in early 1990s and liked to recount his horror-like experiences ( e.g. 
  he had to bring sugar with him , it was impossible to buy almost anything there ) . 
  judging by the statistics they improved a lot . 
  from your recent personal visits ? 
  interesting . 
  do you have a more reliable quantification ? 
   very poor country according to [ list of countries by gdp ( ppp ) per capita ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_gdp_ ( ppp \\ ) _ per_capita ) from wikipedia ( first column ) belarus is better than turkey , bulgaria , romania , montenegro , serbia , macedonia , bosnia , china !, 
  or albania . 
  i mean the massive expense for minor and wildly fluctuating source of electricity . 
   start pushing for more renewable energy the photovoltaic disaster was not enough ? 
  are there plans ( laws ) to reduce subsidies to already existing projects ? 
  yup , a [ public opinion research from may ] ( http://zpravy.idnes.cz/lide-odmitaji-prijeti-eura-clenstvi-v-evropske-unii-jim-nevadi-p7d-/domaci.aspx?c=a140509_164955_domaci_cen ) found 76 % were against euro , 15 % for . 
  czech president is more-less ceremonial figure and has almost no decision power in this area . 
  they are very different state by state . 
   communist and socialist states ( russia , yugoslavia , bulgaria , czech , etc , etc ) are known for their bureaucracy growth of bureacracy on the area of the czech republic depends only on time . 
  austria-hungary had small class of officials and this number grew up ever since . 
  today the state employs record number of various bureacrats . 
  eu related offices and departements and sections even in smallest city councils is the most recent inventions . 
  few more : * it took almost two hours for emergency in prague to place a man with heart attack in a hospital . 
  this happened in spite of recent promises by the minister of healthcare that such events wo n't happen anymore . 
  spokesmen of the hospitals later claimed the problem was blown out of proportion by emergency director who wants to boost his political carreer . 
  * former czechoslovakia had an extensive textile and shoe making industry . 
  the largest textile company was located in city of [ prost\u011bjov ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/prost%c4%9bjov ) and at its peak employed over 10 thousand people . 
  it bankrupted in 2010 . 
  its industrial premises ( 6 large buildings ) were now demolished by controlled explosion . 
  * edit : [ here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twme_zgygwi ) is a video from the demolition showing how flying piece of debris hit a man watching the event . 
  it caused only very minor injury . 
  * [ university of south bohemia ] ( http://www.jcu.cz/?set_language=en ) opened a [ new research station ] ( http://polar.prf.jcu.cz/ ) in longyearbyen at spitzbergen ( svalbard ) . 
  [ en ] ( http://www.ceskenoviny.cz/news/zpravy/czech-first-research-polar-station-opens-in-svalbard/1095143 ) . 
  actually this happened after the communists . 
  instead of being replaced they still stand repainted ( with bright colors ) and flats inside are expensive as a fuck . 
  new flat construction in the czech republic is now fraction of what it used be decades ago . 
  it is common requirement when drawing from eu funds , everywhere . 
  documents and websites need to have eu symbol all over them , signs have to be put on walls . 
  the change of sentiment is not very likely : election leader of social-democracy , one of the most pro-brussels czech political parties , started their election campaign with slogan `` we are not eu lackeys '' . 
  would [ rowan atkinson ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owgzdynpaso ) pass the criteria ? 
  water companies ( originally owned by the state ) were handed over to cities in early 1990s . 
  municipal authorities were subsequently bribed by multinationals to sell them for song . 
  the public was placated by promises that the prices wo n't rise up , only if there 's a technical reason for it and that the multinationals will invest massivelly into the aging grid . 
  the result : prices grow w/o any restriction , nobody even bothers anymore to argue about `` technical reasons '' and the investment into the grid ? 
  well , pipes were as a rule left to the cities to maintain . 
  for the multinationals it is the dream come true . 
  as an example [ here ( pdf ) ] ( http://www.vodarenstvi.com/templates/content-left-right/2012/a01-zisky-z-vody-2012-veolia-zlin-ol-prostejov.pdf ) is graph of profit made by veolia in central moravia between 2000 - 2011 ( the red line ) . 
  the blue line , for comparison , is the `` profit '' made by cities owned company tasked to maintain the pipes . 
  czech government so far refused to put any ceiling on water prices , ignoring warnings and suggestions from the eu . 
  renationalisation as in hungary is not even a dream here . 
   now it 's 75 czk/m3 ( about $ 3 / m3 ) the highest 2014 price [ i found ] ( http://www.cena-vody.cz/cena-vody-v-ceske-republice-aneb-kolik-stoji-voda/ ) is 104 czk/m3 ( ~ 3,85 euro ) in [ t\u00e1bor ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/t%c3%a1bor ) ( water company now owned by austrian energie ag ) . 
    typically 100x or more over 10 - 15 years    was it really a hundred times increase or did you mean to write % ? 
  yes , it could be hundrefold increase . 
  thatts the miracle of having a local monopoly . 
  prices increase every year . 
  in city of [ pardubice ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pardubice ) last year the price went up [ by 9 % ] ( http://www.vodarenstvi.cz/clanky/zvyseni-cen-vody-pardubicko-o-9-chrudimsko-o-7 ) . 
  the water management company is owned ( since 2006 ) by veolia , only the pipes maintenace was left to the city . 
  this is only silly trifle compared to other things czech politicans did . 
  parliament immunity allowed them to drive drunk , to smuggle goods untaxed across the border or to sucessfully hide from fraud investigation . 
  even worse , their collective mismanagement devastated much of the country . 
  it was mainly work of media frenzy . 
  in a later interview he said the uni allowed him to keep his teaching duties . 
  his students supported him a talked about media crazyness .

  at that time arabs mostly taxed christians in conquered areas , but respected their faith to certain extent and did not outright murder them . 
  what motivates you to say things like this ? 
  knife , machete , gun , assault rifle , truck , ieds ... like a loadout in a first-person shooter , next should be either chainsaw or bfg . 
   so i dont think you really proved a correlation between concealed carry and homicide rate exactly - i mention it in the subsequent comment below :  truth be told , the statics on relationship between homicide rates and gun ownership are probably inconclusive, 
   how much more common these sorts of scenes would be if it was n't like that implication of this logic is that mass murders committed by cars or trucks ( nice ) must be much more common because they are omnipresent . 
  it 's obviously not true . 
  truth be told , the statics on relationship between homicide rates and gun ownership are probably inconclusive - you ca n't prove that disarmament of population decreases homicide rate and you ca n't prove otherwise . 
  even cdc in the us which researched this topic admitted that . 
  not related to this article , but to gun control in general : my issue is that i am in favor of our liberal gun laws and i personally own several guns . 
  the ec has been pushing ( in the wake of bataclan ) for tightening the regulations eu-wide which may result in confiscations for me and several hundred thousands of my fellow countrymen . 
  the directive is being justified by bogus statistics and outright lies and the mess about that made me a bit more sensitive to statistics relating to this topic . 
  you sure ? 
  my country ( czech republic ) for example has lower homicide rate than germany , uk or france and we 're the only european country where gun license is shall-issue ( and gun ownership is quite common ) : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_intentional_homicide_rate ** i do n't care whether you get shot or stabbed , i only care whether you get murdered or not . 
  terrorists sometimes do n't have guns . 
  law-abiding citizens in western europe never have them . 
  and mental health or lack thereof, 
  let 's call things their actual names - you are talking about censorship . 
  not that it would n't already happen sometimes , but i will always be 100 % against it . 
  restrictive german gun laws . 
  preventing everyone except the terrorist or criminal from having a firearm . 
  leave . 
  such things can never happen in my country - should i feel lucky or sad because of it ? 
  never seen before experiences brought to you courtesy of merkel & co. 
  even if you were correct , such people should not be allowed to enter europe without proper border control and background checks and not in such vast numbers . 
  if there is an epidemics in certain area , the solution is a quarantine . 
  i can easily imagine that if i moved to e.g. 
  canada or australia , i might become frustrated there and set out on a killing spree because of that . 
  exactly , i have very same feelings and quite often , not just here . 
  i would never have thought that i would live to see some sort of censorship again . 
  i am 100 % certain that i do n't need another person to filter for me information sources to avoid those that someone else considers biased . 
  freaked out because he 's never seen a train before . 
  what method of execution would they use ? 
  impalement ? 
  if they managed to shoot down erdogan 's plane they probably would n't have to shoot at civilians . 
  it 's sad . 
  normally i 'm no fan of military coups , but in this case i wished that military succeeded and protected secular character of turkey again . 
  english is not my native language . 
  am i to suppose that you do n't understand my previous answer ? 
  i wo n't reply to the same question more than once . 
  would n't it be better if you directly stated your intention instead of this dancing around ? 
  most of jews living in germany and occupied countries were citizens of the respective countries . 
  so e.g. 
  germany , protectorate bohmen und mahren , slovak state , hungary , vichy france , etc. 
  what 's the next question ? 
  majority of those occupied by nazi germany during ww2 - i referred to holocaust . 
  cool , i 've read comparisons that she might be sort of thatcher 2.0 and the iron lady was my favorite uk prime minister of last decades . 
  you should n't make fun of other cultures . 
  and btw , their views are far more progressive compared to islam , they e.g. 
  do n't execute gays , etc. 
  i 'm no fan of victimless crimes and limiting free speech . 
  on contrary in my case . 
  i liked german much more than english at school because the grammar was perfectly logic and predictable with very few exceptions . 
  once i learned the rules i did n't have to worry about anything . 
  english grammar is actually more difficult for me . 
  fighting keeps us fit !, 
  how about resignation , after presiding over possibly the worst failure in eu 's history ? 
  even our pro-eu minister of foreign affairs today recommended this ( while online discussions favor seppuku ) . 
  well , 2016 is a year when conventional wisdom fails quite often . 
  and i guess that 2017 may be even more interesting given brexit and especially if there was a president trump in the usa ( i do n't think that clinton will be able to win the election ) . 
  you are forgetting 4 . 
  - gradual erosion / churn of another members and consequently either fading into irrelevance or outright dismantlement . 
  i guess that there will be other referenda in at least few countries over the course of next years . 
  for example , in my country several parties including two present in the parliament demand referendum about czexit / czechout and brexit gave a boost to this effort . 
  and according to opinion polls about 60 % would vote to leave ( possibly / probably including me ) . 
   should we now push for the united states of europe ? 
  unless there 's a really massive overhaul of the eu and its structures i will instead push for referendum about czexit / czechout now when the uk has paved the way for us . 
  according to opinion polls about 60 % of voters would vote to leave so the chances are high . 
  what would make me vote for federalization - basically dismantlement of most current eu institutions and policies and starting from scratch ( e.g. 
  pre-1995 status ) by adopting constitution derived from the us constitution including all relevant amendments . 
  this somehow reminds me of the `` braveheart '' movie and edward i. 
  i feel hope that the eu ( which i strongly dislike in its current form ) will either be forced to massively reform or that it will be simpler for my country to organize similar referendum about czechout / czexit . 
  i expected brexit to happen and i expect president trump in the usa and i also expect that 2017 and beyond will be quite different from the last decade . 
   would you support mandatory backdoors in communication systems ? 
  i generally do n't like it , but i can live with court warranted wiretapping of communication , if limited to severe crimes . 
  i am totally against mandatory backdoors to encrypted devices or criminalization of refusal to provide password to an encrypted device or disk . 
   i expect that it becomes harder for more-restrictive members to enforce their laws . 
  you are mistaken on this . 
  the current push against guns is driven by the eu through a new directive which if adopted will be mandatory for all eu members . 
  i do n't know gun laws in other eu countries good enough but i 'm quite sure that it will mean tightening the regulations for most countries , probably except britain and some other members with already highly restrictive approach . 
  the directive in its original form was introduced in the wake of paris attacks last november , it was basically an abuse of a tragedy to promote certain agenda . 
   freedom of religion it 's guaranteed and it 's actually no concern in my country , because we 're the first or second least religious country in world . 
  basically , no one gives a shit about religion , vast majority of us are n't even christened . 
   when you say `` multiculturalism '' , do you mean in the sense of `` policies adopted to retain multiple cultures side-by-side '' or in wanting to not let other cultures in , like , concerns about overwhelming local culture ? 
  primarily the first , but the second point to certain extent too ( czech republic is very homogenous country therefore concerns about overwhelming local culture would be far-fetched ) . 
  this topic is complex and i ca n't answer it briefly , sorry . 
  one important point is that i want to retain control over who is accepted and who is n't which means that outer eu borders must be protected . 
  what happened in greece was totally unacceptable . 
  brussels and most western european countries insisted that nothing could be done until hungary built a fence and then suddenly the flow of immigrants came to halt , intriguing . 
  i assume you live in the usa , do n't you ? 
  i think that many of the freedom-related issues would go away if we adopted equivalent of the 1st and 2nd amendments to your constitution - i admire them and also wisdom and foresight of your founding fathers . 
  this is very sad . 
  such homophobic poster , i am triggered and maybe will contract ptsd . 
  there are many aspects , but the biggest show stopper for me are the efforts to limit freedom . 
  i remember communism from my youth and i 'm sensitive to any pushes to limit freedom of speech ( e.g. 
  `` hate speech laws '' , political correctness ) , spying on own citizens on the internet and social networks , disarmament of population and other similar things . 
  for me , all of this comes from the eu and is being implemented based on eu directives . 
  for example , in the czech republic we still do n't have `` hate speech '' law in the sense it is currently understood by the eu , we have the most liberal gun laws in whole europe and these things are about to change due to push from the eu . 
  fuck that . 
  you either have freedom or you do n't . 
  and besides the freedom-related issues , i also oppose multiculturalism , dislike eu bureaucracy , consider eu subsidies / grants as form of bribery and want to get rid off them .

  i do n't know why you bringing up the sharia law . 
  that example serves no purpose except perhaps that you want to paint me as sharia law supporter , which would be yet another low blow from you . 
  ... so in other words there is no objective difference . 
  that 's what i 've been saying all along . 
  that means we can not write clear intructions in the law what is what . 
  law has to permit limitations to the free speech in order to judge people for what they said and we have trust the justice system not to abuse this power . 
  only other option is to decriminalize crimes that are defined only by words and intentions such as a crime instigating murder . 
  so what do you prefer ? 
  how can you judge my ideas when you do n't even have enough patience to listen ? 
  only reason i 'm asking you how would you write law against instigation of violence is that i want to understant what is that difference you are talking about . 
  examples you gave me could be easiely switched . 
   a man randomly says as a joke `` kill a dane or two '' . 
  one person around to hear it later kills a couple of danes . 
   a man orders a person `` i wish those danes would just die '' , the person later kills two danes . 
  so how would you write your law against instigation of violence ? 
  you would ban imperative ? 
  you keep saying that but can you actually demostate the difference ? 
  there is no objective difference between an opinion and instigation of violence . 
  only difference is an intention . 
  same words can be an opinion in one case and instigation of violence in another . 
  if you want to make instigation of violence illegal you inevitably need to limit freedom of speech and hope it wo n't be ubused . 
  if instigating of violence were legal then justice system could only punish those useful idiots who do what they are told and leaders would be untouchable even if they had clear agenda of say ethnic cleansing . 
  i do n't see that as just . 
  so , why exactly should be illegal to tell single person to kill but legal to tell multiple people to kill while making a speech ? 
  by the way i 'm not saying vigilatism is the same thing as hate speech either . 
  i 'm saying hate speech is a very usefull tool to instigate violence such as vigilantism . 
  that is a straw man . 
  i do n't want any manipulation to be illegal . 
  i 'm talking specificaly about the hate speech . 
  i think you would n't like if it was legal to hire an assassin . 
  this is in the way similar to the example of a vigelante justice . 
  how can you so easiely tell the difference between voicing his opinion and manipulating crowd to commit acts of violence ? 
  both is done just by talking . 
  on the other hand we should n't forget about good old days of vigelante justice and pogroms . 
  charismatic speaker leading an angry crowd of people can do a lot of harm . 
  it does n't seem right to me that such speaker would be protected under the free speech . 
  what exactly should catalonia leave ? 
  can you give me an example of some xenophobic ? 
  i do n't understand geman very well so i can not judge how harsh those quotes are . 
  i just see some anti-imigration quotes but nothing i would call xenophobic . 
  i think this is general problem of how vague polititians often are . 
  there was a little education experiment among high-school students with a similar premise except it was n't limited to just two parties . 
  most could n't tell the parties apart . 
  quite a lot of them were fooled by we-are-legitimate-democratic-party rethoric of the far left and the far right . 
  they might be right of the cdu but that does n't mean they are far right . 
  cdu is closer to the center than other european center-right parties . 
  wow . 
  what 's with the fasist accusations ? 
  it was my understanding afd is moderate eurosceptical party . 
  blisty.cz is notoriously unreliable source . 
  i would n't be suprised if they were quoting that little opinion poll app news servers sometimes use . 
  there is a lot of irrational pacificism over here but there is no evidence that public would actually oppose nato troops in our territory considering the current situation in ukraine . 
  opinion poll was published yesterday . 
  unfortunatelly they did n't ask about this but apparently 40 % fear russia , 53 % sympathize with ukraine while 14 % sympathize with russia . 
  it 's a shame that stropnick\u00fd does n't have enough courage to support potencialy unpopular decision . 
  where did you get those numbers ? 
  i found 67 % against . 
  i disagree with your views on ussr but i personaly do n't care so much about the past . 
  i would be glad to put the past behind us but it 's hard when russia is still behaving in a very similar way . 
  our counterinteligence is reporting large numbers of russian spies in our territory . 
  your representatives will occasionaly remind us how small and weak we are while russia invades and annex foreign territory . 
  that is not the best way to make friends . 
  yes , we have some satirical parties , but this one is deadly serious . 
  cibulka is just crazy . 
  whenever he talks he just spew accusations . 
  everyone is either corupted or russian spy . 
  if you ask for evidence he responds that everything he says can be easily verified with a sideric pendulum .

  they linked `` 9p151 launcher '' to `` 9k115-2 metis-m '' wiki page . 
   it appears to be a [ 9p151 launcher ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/9k115-2_metis-m ) , which could fire either a 9k115 metis or 9k115-2 metis-m missile , an advanced russian anti-tank weapon .

  i would n't go that far . 
  while there are no reasonable objection on health effects of gmo there definately are reasonable legal objections . 
  way the patent law works nowadays it creates unhealthy monopolies . 
  as i said nobody can guarantee that any food product is 100 % safe . 
  that is how science works . 
  you can not prove positive claim . 
  if you ate only things that were proven safe you would starve to dead . 
  so you need to lower your expectations . 
  secondly if that article was honest it would mention that there is not study that would examine health effects of non gm crops . 
  there is very simple reason why there is no such study either on effects of gm or non gm crops . 
  it 's a nonsensical distinction . 
  every new species might potentionaly have negative health effects . 
  it does not matter how that species come to be , whether it was cultivated naturaly or geneticaly modified . 
   ... all found differences in the gm-fed animals , which in some cases were statistically significant ; notice how it tries to imply that those differences are negative . 
  it 's just rhetorics . 
  i might as well spin it around a tell `` the study found differences in non-gm fed animals '' . 
  this article is missleading . 
  nobody can guarantee that any food product is 100 % safe . 
  however there definitely is a scientific consensus that there is no evidence that gm crops are any more harmfull than other crops and that there is no reason to expect any . 
   rigorous studies investigating the safety of gm crops and foods would normally involve animal feeding studies in which one group of animals is fed gm food and another group is fed an equivalent non-gm diet . 
  independent studies of this type are rare , but when such studies have been performed , some have revealed toxic effects or signs of toxicity in the gm-fed animals . 
  [ 12 ] [ 13 ] [ 14 ] [ 15 ] [ 16 ] [ 17 ] the concerns raised by these studies have not been followed up by targeted research that could confirm or refute the initial findings . 
  [ there ] ( http://www.iatp.org/files/gmotoxicityreport.pdf ) is a link to one of those `` rigorous '' studies . 
  this paper has been long debunked . 
  control group contains only 10 mice !, 
  nobody can draw any conclusion from such small sample . 
  it 's just statistical noise . 
  yet it is quoted again and again by the anti-gmo sites . 
  relevant .

  i know , but still , it will be 2 500\u00a0000\u00a0000 in year 2050 . 
  the gdp growth of african countries is not as fast as you would expect . 
  quite likely there will be migration of people to the europe for better life in the future . 
  even if only 5 % of africans decide to go into europe . 
  it is still 125\u00a0000\u00a0000 people . 
  how we will deal with that , when you see how much problems we have with 1 million . 
  not to mention impact of global warming in africa . 
  it is scary looking future if you ask me . 
  when i was born , population of africa was around 650\u00a0000\u00a0000 , now it is 1 246\u00a0504\u00a0865 people . 
  quite scary how will future look like . 
  well this is realy an million dollar question . 
  truth is , those people lived here for long , long time and i believe many of them would like to live here after the war in peace as many generations here before them , and be done with that bullshit war . 
  but for many of them , the deportation was realy an only choice how to deal with that . 
  i mean , who would like to live near the people which likely wanted get you killed a week ago ? 
  the problem is , how effectively you can determine someone true intentions ? 
  is n't it better to deport them all , to prevent any possible conflict and live in peace ? 
  there might be a bit of correlation with current refugee crisis . 
  the average czech view is that either you will start importing muslims here , and some of them will be realy radical = you will ruin the peaceful society . 
  or you will not take any muslims and live in peace . 
  i am i a cool kid when i was born in czechoslovakia ?

  well , i think croats are as much slavic as czechs or bulgarians are for example . 
  originaly we might have some common roots with other slavic countries . 
  but if you are over 1000 years separated , you will mix together with neighbour countries eventualy . 
  being `` slavic '' those days means , that you only have somewhat similiar language with other `` slavic '' nations , very little to do with ethnicity . 
  source ? 
  and what is `` police officer '' ? 
  does this include city police , army police , fast deployment department , criminal police etc ? 
  it can be translated in many ways , \u0160koda also means `` damage '' , for example '' \u0160koda na aut\u011b byla odhadnuta 1000 euro '' ( the damage to the car was estimated 1000 euro ) . 
  but truth is , and i am sure you know it , that the name is \u0160koda just because the founder of the brand had name \u0160koda , so realistically it is supposed to mean nothing at all . 
  great article from another perspective , if i am `` refugee '' i would be not happy to be forced to live in poland or somewhere in rural estonia as example , when other `` refugees '' have chance to live in germany or sweden with way better social benefits and life . 
  france24 and other stations , even actively promoting commercial , where they showing eastern europe as place full of racists , why would any refugee wanted to live here after seeing that commercial in the first place ? 
  and other people from those `` western '' countries want sanction some `` eastern '' countries for not taking refugees . 
  this is one big paradox for me , promoting some countries as bad place to life , but at the same time blame them , because no refugees are living there as they should . 
  as long as there is such a masive gap in living standards between eu nations , it is quite pointless to force people live in `` inferior countries '' . 
  it is hard to hold native population with long ancestral roots there , do you think any refugee will stay ? 
  you can say - `` we offered them peaceful roof overhead , when they run from the war , does not matter where they will be forced to live , if they dont like it , they should leave '' . 
  so what will happen ? 
  we will keep sending some of the `` refugees '' into poor countries , from which they will keep leaving . 
  and other part of refugees will be send into rich countries , where they will stay and be happy ? 
  most of those people do not leaving mena because of war , they wan na get youself into rich western country .

  president trump , i agree with you , you should prevent americans from buying bmws . 
  instead , you should introduce czech car brand ( czech republic is the country where only white people are , just like you ! ),

  that will show the nasty german companies who is the boss ( you ) !, 
  i normally do n't like this criticizing of trump for the style of handshake , but it is really awkward when everyone shake hands with macron as normal people , but only trump is trying to prove his dominance by pushing him off-balance , why the fuck is he keep doing that ?

  ** safety & security ** threats to national security and personal safety jeopardise economic and social wellbeing . 
  the safety & security pillar measures countries ' performance in three areas : national security , personal precariousness , and personal safety . 
  a stable social and political environment ( as measured by a political terror scale ) is necessary for attracting investment and sustaining economic growth . 
  when citizens worry about their personal safety ( ** measured through questions such as `` do you feel safe walking alone at night ? '' ** ) , their overall wellbeing suffers . 
  the safety & security pillar combines objective measures of security and subjective measures of personal safety . 
  factors such as instability resulting from group grievances ( like ethnic wars ) limit gdp growth . 
  when people 's food and shelter situation is precarious , and when institutions can not support them , they \ufb02ee . 
  academic research shows that organised political violence such as coups or civil war , as well as crime , hinders economic growth . 
  ** in addition , an environment of fear and uncertainty negatively affects life satisfaction . 
  ** personal freedom . 
  ** when citizens enjoy freedom of expression , belief , and organisation , as well as personal autonomy in a society welcoming of diversity , their country experiences higher levels of income and wellbeing . 
  ** the personal freedom pillar measures countries ' performance in two ar eas : individual freedom and social tolerance . 
  the personal freedom pillar captures the importance of various freedoms -- of choice , expression ( in cluding press freedom ) , movement , and belief -- and ** tolerance of minorities and immigrants ** , for a country 's wealth and the wellbeing of its citizens . 
  societies that foster strong civil rights and free doms have been shown to enjoy increases in levels of satisfaction among their citizens . 
  when citizens ' personal liberties are protected , a country benefts from higher levels of national income .

  but i understand and i think we should join eurozone . 
  if there is a referendum about adopting euro right now , i am almost sure , that we will not join eurozone . 
  this is up to politicians , we pledged to join eurozone in 2004 without any concrete date . 
  so we are in situation , where we can join eurozone basicaly any time ( 2021 + ) , since we meet all the requirements . 
  but goverment which decide so , will lose some preferece , for that reason nobody have balls to do it .

  good for meeting people , too . 
  for example where ? 
   what have you learned from / r/askeurope that blew your mind ? 
  that people from all over the continent often agree with my opinions and i agree with theirs . 
  considering all the cultural barriers that we have and different backgrounds i 'd say that 's pretty mind-blowing . 
  that we can almost always get along , even if there is something controversial to talk about . 
  good on us !, 
  i think this is a result of temperament rather than a certain country 's citizenship . 
  any way you look at it , slavs are somewhat less extroverted than south europeans , and interpersonal relationships are a reflection of that . 
  for example , it 's quite uncommon to kiss a friend on the cheek when meeting them . 
  even less so more than once , and almost never if it 's between two men . 
  this is of course a generalization , it 's not like croats act just like czechs who act just like russians - however , there are clear differences in keeping distance from people ( especially strangers ) between the two regions . 
  that all being said , i 'm sure there are italians with small friend circles and slavs who will french kiss you instead of a handshake . 
  i guess it may depends on what kind of nordic folks you hang out with . 
  i was mostly talking to people in their 50s . 
  they spoke good english but with a pretty clear accent . 
  i 'm guessing younger people speak english a lot better because of the internet and american media , but i might be wrong . 
  that 's been my experience too . 
  the swedes i met sounded quite german-ish when speaking english , which is by the way quite logical if you think about it .

   youtube red i belive ? 
  yeah , that 's the one !, 
   is it somehow linked to play store movies ? 
  not as far as i know . 
  i do n't even know how i got the subscription , i do n't seem to be paying anything for it .

  * edit * : i might have it because of the google play music subscription .

  apart from the standard-issue proto-hebrew names like * petr * or * pavel * , let 's take a look at some of the slavic ones that can be directly translated : bohumil - godlover blahomill - prosperitylover dobromil - goodlover ( heheh ) slavom\u00edr - glorypeace milivoj - something about niceness and an army svatopluk - holyplatoon * edit * : these names are all valid , but are largely out of style and you 're more likely to find them in history books than in your family tree . 
   all siblings by name not sure where you 're from , but in my parts it 's quite common to call your siblings '' * vole * '' . 
  it loosely translates to `` man '' or `` dude '' but can also be used as a curse word in the right context . 
  truly a god 's gift to mankind , this word !,

  here 's the [ american embassy in prague ] ( http://1gr.cz/fotky/bulvar/16/013/org/pal60c666_pas4.jpg ) it 's in one of the old town buildings , many of these are also used by czech ministries and other government organizations - so from this point of view , pretty standard . 
  other embassies i know in prague often have a separate house , like a villa , that 's the only difference i can see without going there in person .

   do you do some cleaning just before ** the cleaner ** is coming to your home ?

  serious answer : it is extremely uncommon that there is a cleaning lady in a privately owned household . 
  i 'm not the top 0,5 % so i have no clue . 
  it was kind of wild west . 
  transfer to free market led to some very serious financial and economical losses for the country - smart people gained quite a bit , the smart * and * rotten got to steal hundreds of millions from the state and the others through tunneling . 
  government regulations were full of loopholes or were incomplete . 
  a lot of people started small businesses that filled the holes in the market and had the chance to grow into multi-million companies . 
  that 's a chance today 's generation will never have . 
  many of government-owned properties went to private hands and were often sold to foreign investors . 
  while at the beginning it looked all great , eventually it stopped the economic momentum and well , we have what we have now .

  privately . 
  possession in quantities bigger than small is illegal , just like selling or growing . 
   is there a huge push for recreational or medical legalization ? 
  there is some initiative , but it 's not a big topic politically . 
   is there a stigma surrounding users like in the us of being lazy or stupid ? 
  hmm , to some extent , yes . 
  then again czechs use all kinds of shit and drink all kind of stuff . 
   what are the most common ways of consuming it ? 
  no idea . 
  smoking it i guess . 
  education time !, 
  let 's see if i can explain how the special ones sound : \u00e1 - `` aaah '' \u010d - cz sound in the word `` czech '' \u00e9 - `` eeeh '' \u010f - di sound in the name `` lydia '' \u011b - ye sound in the phrase `` fuck yeah '' ch - the sound you make when someone shoots you in the throat and you gurgle blood while your life is slipping away . 
  \u00ed - ee sound in `` eeek ! '', 
  \u0148 - n in `` nuke '' \u00f3 - o in `` long '' \u0159 - yeah this one i do n't know how to explain . 
  something between a broken car engine and a machine gun and a chainsaw . 
  \u0161 - sh in `` shit , son '' \u0165 - ti in `` tiananmen '' \u016f \u00fa - oo in `` pool '' \u00fd - same as \u00ed , slightly deeper \u017e - di in `` cambodia '',

   my friend 's cyber stalker say what ? 
   he says they gave him a german passport very unlikely . 
  he probably received some identity document , but german passport ? 
  please . 
  on what basis would such a passport be given to him ? 
   now he 's claiming he can now travel to the u.s , is this possible ? 
  no , unless he gets a tourist visa , which is next to impossible for a refugee . 
   do you think your country is `` great '' ? 
  definitely , we are pretty awesome . 
  most of us say that we suck due to recent and not-so-recent history , but i tell everyone that we , as a matter of fact , are pretty great .

  if i ever move it will be just for a few years , because i think my country is really worth living in . 
  no , it is per quarter . 
  see the linked document , or this page : http://www.tradingeconomics.com/czech-republic/gdp-growth, 
  the growth rate is an assumption , under such assumption i concluded it would take 5 years to catch up with the netherlands . 
  so i am not arguing if such growth rate is possible or not , i am just calculating how long it would take to catch up with the netherlands under the assumption that the growth rate is 3.1 % every quarter . 
  in fact if this trend continued it would only take about 5 years ( provided gdp growth of the netherlands would be less than 3 % per year and that the population of the czech republic does not increase ) . 
  but that is of course very unlikely . 
  in 30 years , gdp per capita ( ppp ) of the czech republic would be over 1 million usd . 
  about 20 times more than gdp per capita of usa . 
  no idea , maybe . 
  if more organizations did the exit polls , it would be more difficult to control them . 
  if it 's done by only one organization that can be bribed or controlled in some other way , than you are right , the results could be manipulated in the exit polls too . 
  will there be exit polls ? 
  if there were , it could show if the election results were manipulated . 
  i worry seat belts are n't going to cut it . 
  yes , this is one of the top 100 series on a czech movie database . 
  `` once upon a time ... life '' is 12th and `` once upon a time ... man '' is 33th . 
   that must mean that even some gypsies dislike gypsies . 
  why ? 
  about 3 % of czech population are gypsies afaik , not nearly 18 % . 
  oh come on / r/europe , downvotes for asking questions ?

  9 : ode to joy ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvl7glwzct0 ), 
  it 's nice and all , but that is n't what i am talking about . 
  i was talking about the quoted bit :  if greece defaults on its debt , it 's becoming even more obvious that those greek banks have a solvency , not a liquidity problem . 
  in my opinion , that part is incorrect . 
   if greece defaults on its debt , it 's becoming even more obvious that those greek banks have a solvency , not a liquidity problem . 
  why ? 
  if greece defaults , it 's the government who defaults , not the banks ( i.e. 
  the government has a solvency problem ) . 
  at the moment , the banks still might not have a solvency problem , because a lot of their assents are government bonds . 
  if greece defaults then the banks would have a solvency problem because they would lose those assets ( government bonds ) . 
  so i do n't think it would be obvious they have a solvency problem ( at the moment ) if greece defaulted . 
  they would , but only after the government defaults ( cause : government defaults , effect : banks insolvent ) . 
  can you elaborate ? 
  oh come on czech republic , that shiny light blue is really rad !, 
  i suppose you are right . 
  but i think it is certainly possible to design the system in a way that makes it very unlikely to rig an entire election without people noticing . 
  or at least less likely than when using the current paper ballot system . 
  perhaps i would change my mind if i saw the course though . 
  european union : see , this is the shit you should enforce . 
  well , in my opinion if the politicians are corruptible , its the failure of socialism . 
  because socialism gave politicians power and therefore socialism should prevent them from abusing it . 
  in other words , policymakers are an element of socialism . 
  so , if they are corruptible , it 's a disadvantage of socialism . 
  if you had pure capitalism with no government , there would basically be no corruption . 
  but that 's just my opinion , i realise there are more ways to view this issue . 
  i am aware of the fact that powerful private companies play a big part in this , what i just want to point out is that there is more than one way to view the issue and the solution is not as simple as `` do away with capitalism '' . 
  we actually had that and the corruption was worse than it is right now , not better . 
  politicians will claim the date for the adoption of euro is to be set next year . 
  if politicians are corruptible , it 's the fault of socialism , not capitalism . 
  yes , because a lot of small transactions are done in cash . 
  but people have money in a bank and withdraw money to have some small amount of cash on them . 
  this deposit money would be gone , so they could n't withdraw it . 
  what is much worse though is that banks and businesses would suddenly lose majority of their capital . 
  not a single business could survive that . 
  when 97 % of money disappears , it does n't go unnoticed . 
  i think you overestimate the importance of cash . 
  you are right that short ( recoverable ) blackout would probably be ok , but i do n't think it would matter if there was or was n't cash in circulation . 
  private companies ( groceries ) would probably think of some way to sell goods even if there was no cash ( e.g. 
  run a tab ) . 
  what good is cash when you have nothing to buy with it ? 
  when people are plundering , killing and rioting out there ? 
  when all companies have gone bankrupt , so there is no supply ? 
  you would buy nothing with that money . 
  there would be nothing to buy with them . 
  banks would go bankrupt , so would firms . 
  no production -  nothing to buy . 
  people would plunder ( at least those that had n't withdrawn any cash ) whatever would be left on the market . 
  besides , the money you would be left with would be deflated in value so much that the government would probably start printing some new currency in a state of emergency rendering your cash worthless . 
  that would happen with or without a cash-free system . 
  cash is only a small fraction of all money ( about 3 % i believe ) . 
  it does n't refute anything . 
  it just means that not only did n't us care about the war , they also wanted to capitalise on it . 
  can you provide a source on that ? 
  i thought all aid was paid by gold . 
  no , i am not implying that at all . 
  i am not comparing us with ussr . 
  they did different things , they continue to do different things , but they did that one same thing -- did n't care until it was their problem . 
  they fought against germany because hitler declared war on them . 
  you could have . 
  and as far as we know , you would have had n't hitler declared war on you . 
  i did n't say that . 
  and so was usa . 
  same goes for the czech republic . 
  it is not that high , but it is much higher than i expected . 
  we have basically no competition on our railways . . so they are unsurprisingly shit . 
  so , do you believe if we had a society where women and men were 100 % equal ( in the eyes of the law and society ) , every single field would be represented by almost exactly 50 % of men and 50 % of women ( as long as they are sufficiently large of course ) ? 
  i do n't want to be called sexist , but i do n't know to be honest . 
  maybe there are some differences between women and men in the way they think , what they prefer etc. ? 
  do we have some study that shows that it is n't so ? 
  anyway , even if it is n't so , i do n't think that the society should be changed from the top ( by policymakers ) , but from the bottom ( by people themselves ) . 
  but that 's probably because politically i am leaning right rather than left . 
  the other question is , why to introduce quotas ( use a hammer as you say ) only in some fields , but not all fields ? 
  is n't that a bit hypocritical ? 
  if you suck at predicting the weather maybe you should stop trying to predict it . 
  i like big cities . 
  the bigger the better . 
  nature is something i had enough of when i grew up , but i like to see it every now and then .

i think this is a bit weird way of looking at things . 
  let 's say someone keeps telling people that refugees coming to europe might be connected to isis . 
  nobody believes him . 
  then it turns out to be true and there 's a terrorist attack . 
  the guy who warned that this might happen is n't fucking happy that people died . 
  he knew this would happen . 
  farage was warning against supporting rebels in syria and eu told him to go fuck himself . 
  he was n't fucking happy because he turned to be right again . 
  no , it does n't . 
  there are two ways of looking at this issue . 
  1 ) women who wear skimpy clothing make men horny and unable to control themselves which then leads to them being raped . 
  2 ) women who walk alone at night and drunk should understand that their chances of being assaulted , sexually or not , are dramatically increased . 
  the first one is victim blaming , the second is not . 
  i knew this would be like talking to a wall . 
  if you leave your car unlocked and it gets stolen it 's partly your fault . 
  the thief is a dickhead and you 're still the victim . 
  we could argue that we should n't have to live in a world where your car gets stolen if left unlocked and i agree , we should n't . 
  but we should also be a bit realistic . 
  men are much more likely to get assaulted than women . 
  in a park or in a ghetto . 
  criminality is a problem . 
  assault is a crime . 
  sexual assault is a crime . 
  not a complicated concept , really . 
  and i 'm just curious - are you really czech ? 
  the way you phrase some things makes me wonder . 
  oh jesus , i understand non-czech speakers misunderstanding this but if you 're czech you 're either a special kind of stupid or as you 're doing right now - pushing a pro- ~ ~ refugee ~ ~ immigrant and of course anti-czech agenda . 
  the question was phrased this way : `` do drunk women share a responsibility for being raped if they 're drunk and are going through empty places alone at night ? '', 
  and czechs , who lack western feminist pc sensibilties of course say yes . 
  and i agree . 
  it 's totally different from saying that `` she was asking for it '' . 
  but then again amnesty are known liars and / u/lachtan probably has an agenda to push . 
  when i 'm drunk and going alone through a gypsy neigborhood i 'm very likely to be beaten/robbed . 
  was i asking for it ? 
  have i brought this on myself ? 
  is there a lack of a better judgment on my part ? 
  yes . 
  i said rarely not always and i judge from statistics i 've read . 
  i was talking about czechs , not gypsies . 
  that said , gypsies were trying to immigrate a lot but their numbers were n't that high , it 's just what media liked to talk about . 
  i do n't know about your immigrants but your gypsies are more numerous than ours . 
  also talking about people emigrating as `` export '' is pretty idiotic . 
   let them flee to western europe because romania forced you to open your borders to millions of gypsies . 
  oh wait , no . 
  it 's not , at least not for czechs , our emmigrants are very rarely unskilled labor . 
  czechs immigranting into western europe are usually well educated and do n't really need to beg for jobs . 
  and i 'm not saying this from an `` offended patriot '' standpoint , it 's simply a matter of fact . 
  also ... as far i know , it 's not the eastern europeans who are leading the crime in western europe . 
  it 's non-european immigrants . 
  you offended 200 million muslim indians . 
   eastern half of europe all my life , i know perfectly well about all the mentality archetypes that are present in ** your ** society yes , because eastern europe is one big society that 's basically homogeneous , yet more ignorance from you, 
  oh , finally . 
  the ever-ignorant misogynist easterns did something right for once !, 
  if you knew anything about my country instead of spouting your ignorant bullshit you 'd knew that a big portion of our populace would eat up anything west-related . 
  thankfully , this is changing fast . 
  do n't look at me , i upvoted it but i do n't understand it as well , i want more people to hear his thoughts so he does n't get elected again . 
  of course , our america-educated , progressive and feminist mr. dienstbier . 
  the full package . 
  `` you '' ? 
  are you some idiotic anti-czech slovak nationalist ? 
  wow , with people like you i feel sorry for swedish people honestly . 
  you 're so incredibly brainwashed . 
  lol !, 
  `` hungarians '', 
  or maybe removing kabab from the mediterranean ? 
  true , i should 've have used the the world `` liberal '' . 
  i meant the stereotypical europen political liberal . 
  no , what liberals want are liberal euro-muslims . 
  and liberals tend to be unable to critize a minority group even if it 's a religious one . 
  so i 'm just wondering how will they face this issue . 
  and have you seen [ black hebrews ? 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv8s_tkjohy ), 
  `` will you marry me and take me to america , please ? '', 
  my first thought . 
  let 's see how liberals deal with this one . 
  meet as in irl . 
  not on majority left-wing pro-eu subreddit . 
  well , that 's all you have to say , really . 
  communists . 
  people waving russian flags might be trolling . 
  if they 're not trolling then they 're just as silly as the ones with american flags . . 
  trust me . 
  there 's only one type of people in czech republic who would go and buy and wave american flag while the american army is driving through . 
  their sphere of influence vs. russian sphere of influence . 
  that 's about it . 
  we might acknowledge the `` good '' things they 've done but waving an american flag with all the things america has been doing for quite some time now is a bit too much . 
  i did n't expect any better reaction from you . 
  let me correct you however . 
  `` they are all brainwashed idiots , only you are a fucking airplane . '', 
  those people with american flag live in this delusion about america that never was and never wil be . 
  they only know about america from movies and other types of entertainment . 
  they know nothing about the stuff american government did and still does on daily basis . 
  that 's why i find it embrassing ... edit : hmm , the downvotes , american love sure is tough . 
  embarassing to say the least . 
  i do n't know what ford does but apple says how it is - `` made in china '' and `` designed in the usa '' . 
  standards do n't mean that romania starts producing products of the same quality as germans . 
  romanians might do some work but germans do the majority in these cases do it does n't really matter . 
  and stop being paranoid . 
  i do n't hate romania but it 's a fact that you and bulgaria simply took the prestige out of the `` made in eu '' there 's no reason for any other country besides the two poorest ones in the eu to over use it thanks to you . 
  i 'm just saying it how it is , no offense intended .

  because it is !, 
  we get to live in interesting times !, 
  and they say merkle does n't have a sense of humour !, 
  i was the most pro-eu person i knew in my social circle , but as you say , these recent crises have embittered me with the reality of it all . 
  i am still holding onto my general pro-eu views , but if merkle really forces my country to accept quotas over 90 % disagreement of my countrymen , i will be personally calling for an eu-exit referendum . 
  i think it 's time to leave the union and create a confederacy !, 
  this is an issue of states ' rights !, 
  ( i 'm only half joking by the way . ), 
  i did n't know i was part of any contest . 
  hear !, 
  hear !, 
  lol . 
  i 'm sorry , i just got back , and the replies are getting so long i really do n't have time for this discussion . 
  i could have provided any of the articles in that lmgfy , that is true . 
  i 'm just honestly so tired of the thought of another instance of this discussion , where the other person again completely predictably refuses to accept any economic arguments , that it immediately put me in a defensive mood . 
  you can go back through my comment history , i have answered the question so many fucking times , i 'm extremely tired by the very thought of it . 
  people just hate hearing what economists have to say and i 've learned to accept that . 
  [ let me google that for you . 
  ] ( http://lmgtfy.com/?q=unsuccessful+euro ) for example the very first result : [ time -- it 's time to admit the euro has failed ] ( http://business.time.com/2011/09/12/its-time-to-admit-the-euro-has-failed/ ), 
  there have been so many articles written about this you almost ca n't open the internet without stumbling into one . 
  or else !!, 
  so say we all !, 
  i feel like people arguing this are living under a rock . 
  turn on the tv , read a newspaper , talk to the people . 
  this sub is a reflection of what europeans want ( and need ) to talk about . 
  me included . 
  money . 
  it would look like loads of money . 
  except there has already been at least one intervention into his behaviour -- after the megathreads ended all his bans were lifted and it was said that he will start modding transparently and more objectively . 
  none of that happened . 
  he still has his agenda and believes censorship of immigration issues is the way forward , which this subreddit disagrees with . 
  i believe he 's modding is incompatible with this subreddit , as evidenced by the ever growing ire against him , and threads like this , which wo n't go away . 
  if you want the translation thing to catch on ( i like it too ) , the best thing you can hope for is dclauzel stepping down , because even though he came up with it , he has successfully turned everyone against it by the universal hate for his modding . 
  how can you assume that this is brigading when just dclauzel has personally banned 500 people just starting from the recent change of moderation ? 
  i think those are all users that have been banned still trying to contribute . 
  it may be brigading , but i think banned users are far more likely . 
  and yes , the entire brigading paranoia and banning are completely out of hand . 
  again , the first article says completely different thing . 
  http://www.finanzen100.de/finanznachrichten/wirtschaft/defending-germany-s-trade-surplus_h473292935_184615/ it says emu surplus is at least 35 % of the entire surplus , that 's not negligible . 
  and it has been  50 % for a decade up to 2012 !, 
  thank you . 
  everyone just says the magical word `` brigading '' and everyone is supposed to shut up . 
  it 's starting to be used like `` but think of the children ! '', 
  the issue of immigration is so acute in europe right now and so divisive across the eu that i am in * no way * surprised the frontpage of / r/europe is full of the topic . 
  well , since even the `` centre '' is mad at dclauzel ( and thus mods in general ) , i think it 's rather an indication that dclauzel should leave . 
  could i possibly ask for what reason is the most hated moderator that unifies the entire subreddit in opposition to him so fiercely guarded ? 
  is he secretly pulling the strings of the entire moderation team ? 
  well , if he wrote one book , people might actually buy it . 
  but to write 1 book for each of the 10 years of his presidency ? 
  nope . 
  not even churchill had that audacity . 
    -  is protected there against refoulement and is treated in accordance with basic human standards ,  imo not always met , for example in lebanon . 
    -  has access to a durable solution . 
   not met in almost every nation they need to pass . 
  considering they have to pass at least turkey , greece , macedonia and serbia that would indicate that you think something like 95 % of the countries in the world are not to be considered safe for refugees . 
  rich eu countries really ca n't take billions of refugees from all over the world in the coming decades . 
  i think refugees in turkey meet both those criteria . 
  they wo n't be returned to the warzone as has been demonstrated ( refoulement ) , they are reasonably well treated ( hence why mostly young males are going to europe , while their wives and children are in turkey ) and turkey is big enough that there is a durable solution for them . 
  and as the convention says , we ** do n't have an obligation to grant them asylum ** , there are many ways ( like monetary ) to persuade countries like turkey to take the refugees back , you 'll be reuniting them with their families after all . 
  unhcr -- the un refugee agency [ note on the safe country concept and refugee status ] ( http://www.unhcr.org/3ae68ccec.html )  ( 3 ) simply put , the term '' ** safe country ** '' has been applied , in the refugee context , to countries which are determined either as being non-refugee-producing countries or as being countries in which refugees can enjoy asylum without any danger . 
  clearly , therefore , the concept of `` safe country '' is applicable in two situations which give rise to separate sets of considerations : i.e. 
  in the context of a ) safe country of origin and b ) safe country of asylum . 
  each situation is examined separately below . 
  safe country of asylum *  ( 11 ) according to this use of the concept , ** asylum-seekers/refugees may be returned to countries where they have , or could have , sought asylum and where their safety would not be jeopardized ** , whether in that country or through return there from to the country of origin . 
  of course they * can * apply for asylum anywhere , but ** the unhcr says that we have no obligation to grant them asylum ** and can return them to the first '' ** safe country ** '' ( turkey , lebanon , ... ) they entered on their way seeking refuge . 
  well now we 're talking . 
  per hour worked it might make sense . 
  still though , it seems like badly reported working hours in some of those instances . 
  yet another data . 
  look , the first article you posted says there is 2-3 % surplus with emu members ( down from 4-5 % , but still large ) . 
  http://www.finanzen100.de/finanznachrichten/wirtschaft/defending-germany-s-trade-surplus_h473292935_184615/ so i * am * looking at your freaking data . 
  at this point i do n't know what you want me to believe . 
  every gdp includes financial services and those of the government , that 's standard definition of gdp . 
  but these data are not gdp per capita , otherwise switzerland would be above germoney , spain below uk and slovakia way below israel . 
  those two articles have clearly different data , thus one of them ( or both ) are wrong . 
  i arrived at my conclusion from the article you posted first , because i believe saying `` surplus is mostly with non-emu countries '' does n't equate to  50 % but at least something like  75 % , which was not the case in the data of the first article . 
  and all that is beside the point , the part of the surplus that * is * with the eurozone * is * making it hard for other eu countries to recover , that 's a fact . 
  isis is really trying to piss off everybody enough to get destroyed , is n't it ? 
  except it is not , it 's `` gdp per capita and productivity '' , which i 'm not entirely certain what it means . 
  and it certainly is n't gdp per capita , if you look at the ordering of countries , like switzerland below germany , spain above uk , slovakia above israel , etc. 
  thanks , so according to that graph it varies . 
  currently the surplus with non-emu countries is a bit higher , but it is still unfounded to say that `` surplus is mostly with non-emu countries '' . 
  according to the refugee convention we do n't . 
  only the first safe countries they reach are required to grant them asylum . 
  edit : for anyone downvoting me , please read the parts of the unhcr document i posted in reply . 
  actually , the czech republic does n't provide fighting forces , but field hospitals , similar to mash units . 
  my aunt serves as a head nurse in one of those ( kinda like hotlips ) and she did tours of afghanistan and iraq . 
  they treat both army personnel and native people alike . 
  i like factualjerks !, 
  can you show me a source for that ? 
  that 's not a fair analogy . 
  european coal and steel community was in no way dissolved , it was absorbed into the european communities ( ec ) , and ecu was actually quite successful that it became the ( unsuccessful ) euro . 
  that surplus is keeping the rest of the eurozone from fully recovering thus keeping eur down . 
  it 's germany 's own doing . 
  that data look * really * suspect . 
  and fundamentalist muslims that have no respect for that law and are willing to break it even if it costs them and many other people their lives for the militant ideas they hold . 
  good to know , let 's * not * select you as mod then !, 
  thankfully , you ca n't buy a plane ticket for frankfurt unless you have a schengen visa . 
   we do n't want religion extremism because we saw what it does . 
  sadly , the issue is the 2nd , 3rd and further generations will not have those memories , wo n't remember how much it sucked .

   merkel 's spokesman said the government would take a few days to look into the issue before deciding whether b\u00f6hmermann should be prosecuted incredible !, 
  unacceptable !, 
  horrible !, 
  such attempt abuse power ca n't be tolerated !, 
  is she a bolshevik ? 
   german government , and not the state prosecutor , has to decide ??? 
  you should better read what racism is before you use it as an insult . 
  people and politicians refuse migrants not because of a `` race '' but because at first they think it is impossible to manage it not to destroy ourselves . 
  they are afraid of islam and refuse it . 
  my nation is mostly atheistic and secular ( me not ) , most people are very suspicious and distrustful to any religion . 
  and if a religion teaches its believers to hate and fight us it is unacceptable . 
  we understand that majority of migrants do n't intend to murder us but we have experience that a radical minority is very often decisive . 
  and we were taught by history to believe anybody who says they want to destroy you . 
  inhabitants of eeu are predominantly people ( or descendants of them ) that did not flee despite war , nazi and communist dictatorship . 
  what a laconic comment ... 
  there should be mandatory regular overall medical examination of all children and adolescents twice a year including drug abuse and basic psychological testing . 
  parents must know they would be punished if anything like this happens . 
  the first cause is easy access to efficient birth control methods , particularly hormonal . 
  the hormonal contraception simulating biochemic effects of gravidity has two synergic effects : blocking conception and eliminating a natural desire to have babies . 
  sometimes it has third one - lowering sexual drive . 
  the second cause is a basic divergence between our biological core functionality that is reproduction and organization of society and economy . 
  however it is clear that preventing reproduction in biological optimal age result in rising health problems of mothers and children . 
  a women have highest biological forces before she is 30 . 
  in europe she spends them studying , making money , traveling , partying and having sex not related to reproduction and very ofen not having a deeper relationship . 
  but society ignoring its biological base shall extinct . 
  but it would be a very unpleasant life for last generations . 
  thanks , you are right . 
  we have but we should not use for this cases . 
  it brings nothing good . 
  we have better keep an old roman-law principle : mater semper certa est. 
  ( the mother is always certain . 
  the father is always uncertain . ), 
  not to examine anything as it brings nothing good . 
  it is humiliation and tragedy not only for greeks . 
  the czech kingdom was ruled by the jagiellonian dynasty from 1471 and from 1527 to 1918 habsburgs were czech kings , the czech kingdom was an important part of their empire . 
  from beginning of 16th century czech soldiers participated in wars with the ottoman empire . 
  smaller detachments of czechs already participated in the battle of varna 1444 . 
  when the ottoman empire occupied hungary turks and tatars plundered south east of the czech kingdom . 
  it is expression of ideas that ended in catastrophe : millions people murdered in wars and 12 million germans finally stripped of all property and expelled from east and central europe . 
  `` all animals are equal , but some animals are more equal than others '' . 
  the song was written as a part of the incidental music to the comedy fidlova\u010dka ( 1834 ) , the music is by the composer franti\u0161ek \u0160kroup and the text ( in czech language ! ), 
  by the playwright josef kajet\u00e1n tyl . 
  the comedy fidlova\u010dka is banal but the song soon became very popular among czechs and was accepted as an informal anthem of a nation . 
  in 1918 the first strophe of it became first part of the czechoslovak anthem and from the split of czechoslovakia it is the czech national anthem . 
  the main problem of habsburg monarchy was prussian pangermanism and hungarian nationalism first . 
  the effort to build national states of germans and hungarians in areas , where many other nations lived , raised a storm of nationalism that habsburgs could not manage . 
  they looked for ways to keep the monarchy and transform it . 
  ferdinand d'este , murdered in sarajevo 1914 , prepared a large reform but wwi destroyed the monarchy . 
  you should understand it also in context of industrialization and liberalism of 19th century . 
  loyalty to a king and belief in the god was replaced by a cult of an own nation and belief in the progress . 
  but still you live safely far from us over the channel . 
   erdogan 's wife and harem http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-35773208, 
  as a czech i would not say `` ja '' but `` jo '' . 
  if austrians or bavarians or saxons are more austrians or bavarians or saxons then germans they could not only be bearable they could be yet nice . 
  but if they are more germans then austrians or bavarians or saxons it is not easy to live close to them . 
  and when they start sing `` was ist des deutschen vaterland ? '', 
  it becomes so disturbing that we are asking `` kde domov m\u016fj ? '', 
  but to be honest it is still better then if some of them start to preach europeanism and multiculturalism . 
  i think it is now eminent and urgent to acknowledge that we ( smaller nations ) need to build something like the old monarchy was to have a quiet undisturbed place to quarrel mutually and to dance together cs\u00e1rd\u00e1s and polka and walzer . 
  so if i declare to be oppressed and discriminated by refering me using singular pronoun , because i feel i have many identities , the equality ombudsman shall investigate my complaint ? 
  is there a pronoun grammatic-number neutral ? 
  it looks like the equality ombudsman replaced psychoterapists ... 
  sorry i ca n't agree : italian fascism is a form of radical , authoritarian nationalism that is `` against the backwardness of the right and the destructiveness of the left '' but it is integral part of european political thinking that started in the enlightenment . 
  it is secular and rational . 
  it is violent and anti-liberal , anti-democratic . 
  core of islam is deformed and very simplified judaism , affected by strong fatalism . 
  it is extended into a theocratic political and law system that is very far from any european law systems . 
  it is similarly violent and anti-liberal , anti-democratic as fascism , but it is something very different . 
  the article overrates influence of academic intellectuals . 
  western universalistic liberal cultural , economic , and political order fails in eastern europe , russia , iran not because anybody read heidegger . 
  political and economic systems in usa , canada and non-post-communist european states differ significantly , however they have similar formal structures . 
  these systems have developed during long time . 
  trying mechanically transfer those formal structures in societies having different history and different conditions results in dysfunctional systems . 
  putin 's russia is `` non-liberal '' because yeltsin 's era wrecked whole country , eastern-european states have dysfunctional system of politic parties that formally propagate different `` ideas '' and `` solutions '' but the core ideology is kleptocracy driven by collaborating godfathers behind the scenes . 
  iran revolution was caused by shah pahlavi who wanted westernize and secularize society integrated by islam . 
  the universalistic liberal system is in a serious crisis itself in all western countries . 
  the neoliberal movement resulted in irresolvable financial crisis , political system of two competing and dominating left and right parties degenerates in `` big coalitions '' proving that it became a covering play only . 
  `` liberal '' culture results in moral principles endangering biological substance of society because sex separated from relationships and reproduction means biological extinction . 
  importing `` human resources '' from different cultures to solve it is a suicide . 
  nobody needs to read heidegger to see that all universalistic claims of any order results first in hypocrisy and later in conflicts and catastrophes . 
  a very unhappy event that endangers help for many others : the christian refuges arrived in the czech republic within a resettlement programme and they were originally accommodated in okrouhlik near jihlava . 
  however , they have rejected asylum in the czech republic and they left for essen , germany , by coach on saturday . 
  to understand sweden from outside is more and more difficult . 
  in the time when bergmann made his movies it was much easier ... 
  but i do n't think that word could be used for a longer time . 
  muslims will prohibit it soon . 
  the most important task now is not to sacrifice liberty but prevent destruction and sacrifice lives . 
  we ca n't wait for the moment when they start use drones and chemical weapons like sarin like aum shinrikyo in tokyo subway 1995 . 
  ideological war is useless . 
  using `` all packing '' terms like `` occidentophobia '' hides core of problems . 
  we had religious wars after 1420 for 15 years in my now most secular country . 
  the country was destructed by internal wars and fighting crusaders ' interventions . 
  in 1436 there was a battle and the most radical wing was defeated by a mediate wing . 
  after the battle soldiers who surrendered after promises of renewed military service , were burned to death in nearby barns . 
  only after that peace was possible in country , radical dangerous ideas extinct only with heads containing them . 
  it is horrible , cruel and `` inhumane '' but there are hundreds examples in history . 
  wars finish either in victory of one side or in exhausting all . 
  we need the first type of end and be victorious . 
  a not historic example of religious thinking -- joke i heard in poland in forty years ago : two bolshevik high officials walk in a street and they see an old lady kneeling under a cross praying : `` oh my lord , my single cow died , what me poor lady could do , please send me new one ! '', 
  one communist official asks the other : `` how much a cow do cost now ? '',

  unfortunately , that 's true . 
  eu is like a marriage , if there is a difficulty , you have to work it out together . 
  some want to divorce already , when there is a sign of a coming problem . 
  those are gold diggers . 
  germany is also the biggest investor here . 
  german companies are the reason behind the big exports to germany . 
  our economy is essentially dependant on germany , if we like it or not . 
  it 's our biggest neighbour . 
  if their economy goes down , our follows , it was always this way . 
  corrupted by czechs !, 
  it 's not eu fault that we have corrupted thieves right at source . 
  eu pointed it out 100 times already and what changed ? 
  nothing , stealing continue ... 
  unless you are n't big as germany or usa , you gon na be influenced anyway . 
  what you may influence is , which side you gon na choose . 
  i think , that eu is the best option on the plate or are you more lean toward the taste of russia ? 
  how many foreigners do you know personally , if you are so experienced ? 
  how many friends or colleagues do you have outside of your czech friend-zone ? 
  and what is your alternative ? 
  how will cz look like when we are outside eu ? 
  keep in mind , that we are not britain . 
  crazy russia is here, 
  well said . 
  the problem , why ex-commie countries are so fearful about immigrants is , that they have zero experience with influx of people from different cultural regions outside of europe . 
  they were isolated for decades and they are getting to know the outside world very slowly . 
  if we take it into the extreme , it 's like if the regime of isolated north korea would fall , and they gon na experience the influx of arabs or africans . 
  north koreans would be in complete cultural shock , and they would n't know how to deal with such situation . 
  fear from unknown would be the major force in their society . 
  we have to prepare ex-commie european societies for this type of globalisation . 
  it should have been done years earlier and the politicians failed in this regard greatly , instead , they stir up the fears of locals . 
  the current situatin , when western eueopen countries do n't know themselves how to deal with such immigration , does n't help neither . 
  we need widespreed discussusion across whole eu and each opinion has to be heard and analysed . 
  people have to feel , that they are heard and that our leaders know what they do . 
  i know , it 's difficult right know , but we have to do it . 
  we should calm down the whole situation . 
  ... but you would bankrupt soon . 
  france , spain , portugal , belgium , ireland and italy have the highest deficits within eu ( except greece ) . 
  i do n't think germany would like to bail out all countries in it 's sphere . 
  the rest of the eu is in much healthier condition and it helped germany to get richer and increased its influence on the continent ( while the influence of france declined ) . 
  you have to understand , that we have absolutely different experience with nationalism here in europe compared to usa . 
  nationalist movements killed tens of millions people and destroyed the continent . 
  we do n't want this to happen again , that 's way any nationalistic moods are highly sensitive here . 
  yeah , we have carcinogenic politicians who help to poison people 's minds i.e. 
  our current pig-like president [ zeman ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/milo%c5%a1_zeman ) , thief [ klaus ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/v%c3%a1clav_klaus ) or xenophobe [ okamura ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tomio_okamura ) , just to name a few, 
  i would love to have such neighbour !, 
  wait a second !, 
  actually , all my neighbors are like that, 
  people are sheeps with no brain, 
  we do n't, 
  what 's wrong about atheism or gay people for poland ? 
  we do n't want to rearm germany, 
  good , but they should include brno in cz , hamburk in de and other tech-progressive cities, 
  they never took it as a joke . 
  we need to call jedi master asap, 
  let 's apply it on 56 % of politicians then, 
  teachers are educating the future generation of latvia . 
  their status should be improved and not the other way around . 
  if they want to reduce their salary by more then 50 % ( which is crazy ) , politicians should reduce their own first . 
  let 's reduce the income of politicians by 50 % , what about this ? 
  she is selling europe like kebab, 
  this smells like reich revival, 
  erdogan seems to love kitsch . 
  his whole new palace is one big kitsch . 
  dictators have no taste . 
  havel was the best president we have ever had . 
  he has always said the truth , no matter what and he has cared about his nation . 
  klaus - narcis , self-centred populist , thief . 
  zeman - populist , liar , backed by oligarchs and both of them with connections to kremlin . 
  they do n't care about people , they just care about themselves and sheep-following people listen to them like they are saint . 
  crazy . 
  the majority do n't like him, 
  i see , you are his big fan . 
  he is a professional liar who is using people 's fears to gain popularity - right now it 's immigration . 
  he is one of the biggest failures of our political system since revolution , together with klaus , they represent the worst of the worst . 
  they have connections to criminals , oligarchs and foreign dictators . 
  loved by whom ? 
  uneducated xenophobic individuals , that 's his league, 
  zeman is an old populist , we ca n't wait till his mandate expire, 
  very interesting . 
  i understand the injustices which both sides can feel . 
  i think you need to move forward . 
  i would start with calling russians in estonia : estonian russians . 
  you need to distinguish them from the russians of russia , it would give them also the feeling of attachment with the state . 
  also , when talking about that they are seen as villain , you need to talk about the soviet state as a villain and not about the ordinary people . 
  i guess , they were resettled from different areas of soviet union to estonia and many did n't even know where they end up . 
  estonian russians need to feel like a real citizens of estonia . 
  they need to feel they are home and that they need to protect the country against any aggression from outside . 
  estonia needs to say those are our russians , russia give your hands out of them . 
  estonian russians will identify themselves with the state , most of them were born already there , they have nothing in common with putin 's russia , for many of them is as foreign as for ethnic estonians . 
  just hang out with each other more often and it 's going to be fine . 
  fight against putin 's propaganda together . 
  that 's true . 
  if it was n't of hitler , we would be assimilated today . 
  intermarriages were very common , czech kids were sent to german families as exchange to learn the language and german kids to czech families . 
  ordinary people lived together for centuries in peace and were bilingual . 
  nazi propaganda screwed it all . 
  sudeten germans say themselves today , that we were gon na to assimilate into one nation of two languages . 
  unfortunately , the conditions of the mid of century did n't whish us this to happen . 
  that 's way is important , that your government will take the propaganda seriously and work on the closer ties between the two ethnicities of estonia . 
  united we stand , divided we fall - very true - czech rep. can confirm .

  this reminds me of my favourite activity during breaks before german classes at high school . 
  we 'd take a random page in the textbook and read it out loud in the hitler-voice , until we could n't stop laughing . 
  oh that was fun . 
  you have a wonderful language ; the language of anger , as rammstein said . 
  `` modern world is very complicated and we need flexible , well-educated citizens to navigate it . 
  for this reason , let 's make sure that ... ... the people who educate our precious next generations are constantly frustrated , underpaid , under-appreciated , angry and cynical . 
  because that will make them teach our children better . '', 
  right . 
  so much fossilised jingoism . 
  the good ol' days were pretty shit , were n't they ? 
  i am kind of proud our motto is pretty benign . 
  i was wondering why i 've been hearing so much spanish around the town in the past couple of years . 
  such brutality was common in religious warfare of the reformation . 
  czechs were just a bit too early for their own good . 
  the germans and hungarians wanted to get to 100 % and it backfired . 
   cz is soon going to start distancing itself more and more from v4 as we really do n't want to be lumped in together with what 's currently going on in poland and hungary . 
  babi\u0161 : hold my beer, 
  czechoslovakia `` occupied '' itself ? 
  who made that map ? 
  thanks to our glorious language for the immense difficulty i had with learning the months of the year in english . 
  the same arguments are used by loggers and lobbyists who want to harvest trees in the \u0160umava national park here in czechia . 
  they 're equally false . 
  seriously , fuck pis . 
  someone please stop these gangsters , it 's painful to watch how much irreversible damage can one bunch of idiots do in such a short time . 
  moravian history is somewhat monothematic sometimes . 
  i do n't remember how many times i read inscriptions like * `` destroyed by swedish armies during the thirty years ' war '' * on information boards in towns , castle ruins etc. 
  at least we in brno drove them off , phew . 
  exactly . 
  australia is also a continent , but with a single government , which makes it much easier for them to enact self-preservation policies . 
  europe is often paralysed by inaction , both of national governments and , consequently , the eu . 
  last time i was in iceland ( yearly may ) , there were a couple of sunny days when i wore shorts and t-shirt . 
  must have been over 20 \u00b0 c. 
  global warming ... , 
  i seriously do n't understand why it takes such a long time in europe to do what 's necessary . 
  not that i support american gung-ho attitude , but sometimes you have to act quickly and deal with the diplomatic fallout later . 
  waiting and doing nothing for years before the migration crisis really gets serious , and waiting some more before adopting ( one part of ) a necessary solution , that 's nothing short of failure . 
  there must be eu asylum processing centres in africa/middle east . 
  all migrants attempting illegal entry into europe must be returned for processing to these centres . 
  those ineligible for asylum must be returned to countries of origin asap . 
  people the source countries must be informed that attempting illegal entry into europe ( a ) is dangerous ; and ( b ) wo n't succeed . 
  then they will perhaps stop being stupid . 
  in the future , the refugee conventions must be amended as well to substantially reduce the amount of people who can claim international protection in developed countries . 
  instead , developed countries should be more pro-active and act quickly to establish safe zones in conflict regions to shelter displaced persons before they decide to try their luck migrating to europe . 
  sigh . 
  using words such as `` steal '' is not constructive . 
  as i noted above , the problem was more complicated than that and both sides are guilty of failing to reach a a fair agreement without violence . 
  i 'll quote wiki as i have no other source handy in english :  after the end of world war i , both of the two newly created independent states of second polish republic and first czechoslovak republic claimed the area of cieszyn silesia . 
  czechoslovakia claimed the area partly on historic and ethnic grounds , but especially on economic and strategic grounds . 
  ** the disputed area was part of the historic lands of bohemian crown . 
  the only railway from czech territory to eastern slovakia ran through this area ( ko\u0161ice-bohum\u00edn railway ) , and access to the railway was critical for czechoslovakia : the newly formed country was at war with b\u00e9la kun 's revolutionary hungarian soviet republic , which was attempting to re-establish hungarian sovereignty over slovakia . 
  ** the area is also very rich in black coal , and it was the most industrialized region of all austria-hungary . 
  the important t\u0159inec iron and steel works are also located here . 
  all these raised the strategic importance of this region to czechoslovakia . 
  on the other hand , majority of the population was polish , with substantial czech and german minorities . 
   the polish side based its claim to the area on ethnic criteria : a majority of the area 's population was polish according to the last ( 1910 ) austrian census . 
  ( ... )  in january 1919 a war erupted between second polish republic and first czechoslovak republic over the cieszyn silesia area in silesia . 
  ** the czechoslovak government in prague requested that the poles cease their preparations for national parliamentary elections in the area that had been designated polish in the interim agreement as no sovereign rule was to be executed in the disputed areas . 
  the polish government declined and the czechoslovak side decided to stop the preparations by force . 
  ** tl ; dr -- the area was disputed and both sides had a good reason to claim the territory . 
  poland acted unilaterally by trying to establish facts on the ground by calling an election ( which it should n't have ) and czechoslovakia responded by seizing the territory by force to prevent this ( which it should n't have ) . 
  subsequently , in 1925 , a treaty was signed that settled the territorial claims :  the conflict was only resolved by the council of the league of nations ( international court of justice ) on 12 march 1924 , which decided that czechoslovakia should retain the territory of javorina and \u017ddiar and which entailed ( in the same year ) an additional exchange of territories in orava - the territory around ni\u017en\u00e1 lipnica went to poland , the territory around such\u00e1 hora and hladovka went to czechoslovakia . 
  the new frontiers were confirmed by a czechoslovak-polish treaty on 24 april 1925 and are identical with present-day borders . 
  since that point , there was no reason why the two countries should n't have allied , especially after 1933 and the rise of the nazis to power in germany . 
  they did n't and their mutual hostility was one of the reasons why it was so easy for hitler to destroy both of them . 
  as the saying goes , `` if you do n't hang together , you 'll hang separately '' . 
  i hope they can differentiate between czech and polish . 
  that 's britain for you . 
  mistakes and miscalculations abounded on both sides . 
  czechs acted unilaterally because they considered the piece of land to be of vital strategic importance if slovakia was to be held ( due to the railway connection that ran through there ) . 
  further , czechoslovakia generally considered poland to be backwards and of little importance and relied instead way too much on france ( with catastrophic results ) . 
  that is clearly czechoslovakia 's fault . 
  on the other hand , poland made no effort to recognize the strategic importance of that tiny piece of land and acted in a typical jingoist fashion ( `` must be ours !, 
  '' ) , and subsequently could not forget about it and reapproach czechoslovakia to reassure against germany . 
  the polish participation in the dismemberment of czechoslovakia in 1938 was especially idiotic , given that poland was clearly the next course on the dinner table . 
  from a hindsight , both countries screwed themselves royally over a petty little squabble . 
  being able to make fun of your own country/nation/stereotypes is what makes you strong ( k ) . 
  perhaps the stupidest mistake of czechoslovak foreign policy ever . 
  the poles surely co-operated in the stupidity , though . 
  * chuckles *, 
  i know , i was joking . 
  the pronunciation is very confusing , especially to czechs . 
  i am fascinated by the icelandic language and will try to learn it regardless ; it is pretty hard to obtain learning resources , though . 
  especially your pronunciation is hell ( or should i say hetl ? 
  is there room for two more ? 
  yup . 
  before ww2 , czechoslovakia was a major supplier of arms to many countries around the world . 
  we even supplied the wehrmacht later / s, 
  as my american professor said in college : * czechs assimilate quickly * . 
  ( or import more foreigners . ), 
  but you 're absolutely right , of course , the decision to fix czk at 25 per eur was a huge middle finger to czech consumers . 
  we need to stop competing as a place with low-wage labour and start competing by producing and exporting innovation . 
  that will require a massive improvement in all levels of education , making business easier to start and grow ( we 're doing the opposite at the moment ; small entrepreneurs are the class enemy while huge conglomerates led by the freaking ( ex ) minister of finance gobble up eu subsidies and tax credits ) , all kinds of steps . 
  most of all , we need politicians with a vision . 
  if i could , i 'd send 100 talented kids to live and learn in finland and when they came back , i 'd give them absolute power for 10 years to enact the necessary reforms . 
  the info-graphic says `` people from central european countries '' ... 
  too flat , too cold , i guess . 
  czechs do n't mind cold if there are mountains to climb ( and fall from ) . 
  how many in iceland ( not technically western europe , but the map does n't care so why should i ) ? 
  i know of three , but there must be more . 
  is there a room for more ?

  you could achieve the same by just changing the parameters of the current model ( actually , the current model does that to a certain extent ) . 
  so bi is a change to how money is redistributed in society -- it would lead to some people becoming poorer and other people becoming equally richer . 
  i 'm quite sceptical about bi because i have n't seen any analysis that would answer the question who exactly would get richer / poorer and how much . 
  unemployed people get money from the government today -- will they get more or less after implementation of bi ? 
  what about teachers , software developers , bus drivers , lawyers , etc ? 
  afaik , the main benefits of bi are supposed to be : - the system would be simpler and cheaper . 
  yes , simpler , but only negligably cheaper . 
  - it removes disincentives to work . 
  i 'm not convinced about this , you could argue the opposite is true actually . 
  i just wanted to say the same thing and then saw your comment . 
  i ca n't imagine anyone doing this by mistake . 
  if you 're making a map and know nothing about geography , you do n't just do it randomly like `` ok , let 's put ummm ... let 's say bulgaria here '' . 
  just a little bit of advice -- do n't give them your reddit username , 
  haha , yes . 
  http://us.cdn200.fansshare.com/photo/mauritius/map-blue-world-map-1563167418.jpg yellow = europe white = not europe yes , i 'm an imperialist . 
  really ? 
  first time i hear about this . 
  the eu supports ukraine for certain reasons and `` buffer zone '' is n't part of them . 
  not wanting to have border with unstable and violent countries is a reason against having border with turkey . 
  ( another thing , i do n't fully understand what people mean by `` buffer zone '' , it 's a very vague buzzword . ), 
  thanks , that could be it . 
  why did the demand fall so much ? 
  your comment has a very `` in your face '' feel , not nice but funny , , 
  there 's nothing funny about not wanting to have borders with countries with ongoing civil wars . 
  i do n't see the similarity with ukraine . 
  better than slovenia as usual . 
  lol poor romania , they do n't deserve that , 
  lol :d, 
  not sure if i was clear enough , i specifically meant big brother , 
  we think of the usa as our big brother . 
  that 's stupid , albania should be se for example . 
  hahahaha . 
  good luck to scotland !, 
  who will you vote for ? 
  what benefits ? 
  nooo i laughed !, 
  i 'm sometimes thinking about creating a site similar ( but also different ) to reddit . 
  ( if anyone 's interested i can give more info . ), 
  let 's create our reddit instead !, 
  ideally : - clarity in thinking and vision , simple and efficient structure . 
  currently eu seems to me as a complicated mess of various institutions . 
  the line between eu and local government competence seems messy and blurry too . 
  - e-government as a top priority . 
  - for example , every public transit provider should be legally obligated to publish timetable data in a standardized format . 
  that would allow to build pan-european public transit journey planners . 
  - another example , it should be possible to found a company online through your web browser , within 1 hour . 
  - european electronic id card as a replacement for current id cards . 
  - it should be as easy for companies to expand and operate in other eu countries as in the us . 
  currently , you have to hire a lawyer , create a subsidiary , etc. 
  - in the more distant future , i would n't mind merging with russia 's union . 
  china and india have a combined 2 billion population and fast economic growth , they could become quite geopolitically powerful . 
  realistically : - uk stays in the eu, 
  note that the comments here will be biased too , this sub is very pro-eu . 
  both - nuclear energy !, 
  let 's build some reactors !, 
  that explains the soldiers who accidentally crossed the border lol, 
  i made a mistake , it should be 140 * 140 = 19600 given that : - there are 140 flairs - single flairs are included - you can have both e.g. 
  uk+s cotland and scotland + uk, 
   these annoying people who use a eu flag instead of identifying their home country yes , i 've never understood that . 
  you would need 3892 flairs . 
  edit : it 's actually 140 * 140 = 19600 . 
  i think they 're just senile . 
  boooring and it would have the same name as europe the continent . 
  plus australia , new zeland , japan and south korea . 
  more countries = more power . 
  let 's call it eurutopia . 
  i actually quite like babis but you have a point , 
  haha , i just had a raw knedl\u00edk taken from a fridge . 
   for various reasons mostly putin, 
  people here do n't know that you like us , if they knew that , they would like you ( even ) more . 
  it 's gypsies , not romania , you were not in the survey . 
  romov\u00e9 = romani , rumuni = romanians and i remember headlines that only 12 % would want a gypsy as a neghbour . 
  i doubt that but some people are pro-communist and pro-russian , older people typically . 
  it 's a common nickname for people officially called franti\u0161ek . 
  for example i 'm called franta  it 's also often used in jokes , stories , etc. 
  and it has a slightly funny connotation . 
  it 's a common nickname for people officially called franti\u0161ek . 
  for example i 'm called franta  it 's also often used in jokes , stories , etc. 
  and it has a slightly funny connotation . 
  return the bible or gtfo !, 
  that was my theory after seeing the map too , that poles do n't like big powerful nations such as russia or germany -- czech republic on the other hand is small and harmless plus we 're west slavic as you . 
  lol , never heard of that :d, 
  search `` gypsies '' on reddit . 
  thanks , that 's nice of you . 
  edit : but what can we do to surpass spain and italy ? 
  both lost , russia slightly more . 
  what 's the song at the end ? 
  i thought neocons are very pro-russian . 
  at least our neocons are . 
  thank god for slovakia . 
   democracy is a form of government in which all eligible citizens are meant to participate equally -- either directly or , through elected representatives , indirectly -- in the proposal , development and establishment of the laws by which their society is run . 
  yeah , sure , i understand the reason people use that term . 
  eastern european has negative connotations compared to central european ( and it 's also geographically incorrect ) . 
  oh ok , noticed that too . 
   and in the last 2 years the gap between american and european redditors has been increasing what kind of gap ? 
  lot of czechs go to croatia on vacation . 
  czech republic - some anonymous and irrelevant eastern european country ( people here hate being called eastern european ) . 
  - beer . 
  - hot women , although i 'd say we 're just slightly above average . 
  - prague .

  i got an elective surgery in about 50 days , so that 's fine . 
  also basic income , equality , direct democracy and other stuff . 
  pirates are also fighting it . 
  hostile ? 
  the government support is big , too big . 
  just try telling people that you do n't want children at all . 
  we need more factory drones ? 
  instead of increasing population , we should increase wages and split money better . 
  england does n't have free education . 
  right wing parties in czech republic made healthcare less free and wanted to introduce tution . 
  free education , healthcare and basic income seem left . 
  they might have double the unemployment , but people there earn more and work less . 
  there was a gypsy who presumably killed 26 people in my country by starting a fire . 
  the quality of food in czech republic is lower than in the west europe . 
  cost of living varies for people . 
  some things cost almost the same . 
  what is gdp growth good for , when the wages are still very low ? 
  let 's see what shit parties , we get next year . 
  so far no new ones seem viable . 
  i do n't think it is a case here , pensioners often struggle to get by , but if you do n't have children , you should be doing fine if you have a job . 
  it is more of a state , where body/society cause distress to us . 
  there are also people like me , who do n't identify as one binary gender . 
  i live in plzen and i am trans and a lot of people just block or ignore me once i tell them i am trans . 
  leftists party won the election , but one the parties in the coalition are christians . 
  it gets worse outside prague . 
  people say that the reason against gay adoption is the children would get would be bullied . 
  maybe that parents should teach acceptance . 
  i have heard racism , homophobia from my family , not that we should respect/accept people . 
  80 % is more than i would expect , gay marriage support is only about 50 %, 
  they average is n't that high , but the welfare is pretty high , so is the minimum . 
  we need to tax companies better . 
  why do you have a weak phone ? 
  electronics still cost the same, 
  you can , my mother is on it as well . 
  i would recommend trying to get it . 
  some workplaces here are still gender segregated , it is sad . 
  yeah , why bother ? 
  i am just really worried i will be taken off the disability pension, 
  eu has also helped with reducing discrimination . 
  i think increasing minimum wage is only way to solve this . 
  if wages were higher , more people would want to work . 
  abortion is cheaper than a baby . 
  doctors get about 15 $ per visit in czech republic . 
  i am one of them , i dropped out from school , because i was depressed . 
  how am i supposed to get a job , when i ca n't work full time and the few part time jobs are likely to make me even more depressed ? 
  looks like a donut in czech republic . 
  low minimum wage , corruption, 
  then you find out people ca n't afford medical attention or go to university . 
  some people stay to protect themselves , people get killed for leaving islam . 
  here the ruling parties at least pretend to try to deal with it . 
  that 's why you need to tax companies, 
  check my comment history , watch hot fuzz, 
   policemen / - women . 
  you are supposed to use police officer . 
  sexism against males is more accepted than blaming religion . 
  in reality there are job offers that literally say `` we are hiring women '' or `` we are looking for men to work in a warehouse '', 
  while eu laws ban it , it is still common here . 
  some jobs only hire one gender . 
  because it is okay to discriminate against males . 
  they pay about 70 % more than minimum wage in my country . 
  it has been becoming more popular here , especially among educated women to have both surnames , but still very rare . 
  we should promote healthy weight . 
  being too thin will usually kill you earlier than being overweight . 
  it is quite common . 
  i can see `` we are hiring women '' every day . 
  gender should n't matter . 
  less people is not the problem , inequality is . 
  if we distributed the wealth better , it would be okay . 
  they are expensive if you want to have good living standard . 
  on the other hand some companies only hire women, 
  i heard of similar thing 30 years ago in my country . 
  there should be about 2 more czech redditors from my city ( pilsen ) . 
  i am in multiple online chat groups on kik and skype . 
  it does n't . 
  lack of social interaction is one of the main reasons for my depression . 
  maybe that they should get some form of entertainment . 
  some politicians just put helping migrants over human rights of natives . 
  what problem is there with gender ? 
  discrimination based on it ? 
  having gender markers matter ? 
  only slightly higher unemployment . 
  lower wages due to lower work hours and less work experience and gender discrimination might also be a cause , since the jobs only offered to women often have low wages . 
  i do n't drink alcohol . 
  same in plzen . 
  i am one of the few unemployed czechs , because i ca n't really work due to my mental issues . 
  while your post refers to porn , the reality is that many regular jobs only hire women . 
  so much of it are agriculture subsidizes . 
  same problem . 
  same in czech republic , tax dodging is so common . 
  pay an employee minimum wage to avoid income tax and reduce insurances . 
  make your job only 300h/year officially , but work much more , while having another contact signed by a relative who does n't work for more money . 
  seatbelts reduce chance of dying in a crash tenfold . 
  it makes a bit of sense , being stressed can make people do crazy thins . 
  how about we replace workforce with robots ? 
  catholics . 
  not really , but there are benefits to get married . 
  that might make the christians unhappy . 
  they came 7th in the election . 
  not very christian country , but a lot of people are still mild believers , but do n't go to church . 
  christian party being part of the government .

  how is that not argument from authority ?!, 
   but since you 're curious , i 'm actually a physician who , while not being a specialist in infectious diseases , has worked in the past in the field of public health . 
  i guessed you might have some kind of formal education . 
  i called you an educated idiot after all . 
  but i did n't actually asked . 
  it was meant as an insult to your education . 
   advocating for hand-washing after using the toilet = ** directly ** implying i want to live in a sterile environment ? 
  no , there are a few extra assumptions there , you would know about if you spend at least some of your mental capacity on understanding my possition instead of just your usual shaming and logical falacies . 
  i think i have explained myself more that enough . 
  but whatever , let me try once more . 
  do you understand concept of redundancy in safety and prevention ? 
  it means that system works even if you remove some of its parts . 
  there is nothing wrong with having high standards . 
  but we should also have realistic expectations of what happens what happens when you lower the standards a bit . 
  cleaning hands after using bathroom , as opposed to before preparing food for instance , is one the least important parts of that system . 
  apparently you just learnd something in school and you never questioned it . 
  you are not interested in how and why . 
  which is ok i guess , but i am not sure why you want to engage in discusion about topic you are not interested in . 
   yet again , this is a straw man , as i 've never said , insinuated , or even hinted at something like this . 
  of course you did but you simply does n't understand implication of your own words . 
  if you highly value very minor risks of contamination it directly implies you want to live in near sterile environment . 
   ... why fecal contamination is extremely undesirable even in the first world ... staw man after straw man . 
  all i am saying is that prevention of this problem is more that sufficient and that washing hands specificly directly after using the toilet does very little because of that . 
  you are either unable or unviling to understand . 
  in either case you have not demonstrated you have education of any value . 
  perhaps if you did n't want to discus this you should not respond to me in the first place . 
  problem here is that you have very absolutely no grasp on relative importance of all those prevention methods and no desire to even think about that . 
  i mean obviously resposible people have interest in listing all method of prevention they can think of regardless how important they are , so they can provide best possible advice . 
  but that does not mean we need to ostencibly obey every single point or face severe consequences for our health . 
  i see little value in washing hands in the middle of handling something potentionaly contaminated with various kinds of pathogens . 
  you think thats ignorant . 
  i think your suggestion , that toilets are especialy danderous because fecal bacteria are well understood cause of various diseases especialy in the third world , while ignoring that our obsession with clean toilets pretty much reversed that situation , idiotic , as in you perhaps learned something but you only blindly obey it you have no actual understanding . 
  for crying out loud you even contradic your own sources . 
  wiki article on fecal-oral route states :  ... when pathogens in fecal particles passing from one host are introduced into the oral cavity of ** another ** host . 
  i would think it trivial to understand that it is imposible to infect myself with my own bacteria . 
  perhaps i get get very minor local infection i wo n't even notice because my immune system can easiely destroy it , but i certainly ca n't get something with noticible symptoms like diarrhea . 
  point is you need quite a large population of people and/or animals otherwise there is little purpose in talking about this transmission mechanism . 
  i may play shocked but that 's obviously all you can do . 
  if you want to resolove this you will have get of your high horse and use your brain for a change . 
  perhaps then we can at even talk about something actually interesting , like if it is even desirable to live in near sterile environment . 
   where on earth did i say or imply that ? 
  you assume that unknown safe instead of other way around , which is nonsense , especially when it comes to hygiene . 
  i assume my hands are always contaminated when i am outside . 
  i clean my hands when there is actual reason to , like before preparing food . 
   i 'm afraid of people citing the advamces in modern medicine , which are mostly a function of improved hygiene , ... 
  yes , but those advances have everything to do with proper sewage systems , access to clean water , strict policy of washing hands ** before ** doing something in certain professions and very little to do with individual hygiene . 
  i you were transported to the past in some dirty overcrowded city , your policy of clean hands after using toilet would n't helped you if you had to rely on the same food and water sources as everybody else . 
  it would be no good even if you convinced everybody to do it . 
   ... comes right out of your ass , and can indeed be dangerous . 
  this is another nonsense . 
  yes , there are some very rare strains which are indeed dangerous . 
  but bacteria out of mine ass specifically are safe . 
  if they were n't i would be infected already . 
  in order for those bacteria to be dangerous you would need sufficient population density and bad enough public hygiene to exponentially increase likelihood of spreading the disease which otherwise ca n't sustain itself . 
  what a straw man , i never said toilets are perfectly clean or that washing hand is pointless . 
  i even said it 's effective way to prevent spread of diseases where there is a significant risk . 
  what are you so afraid of anyway ? 
  cholera is n't really an issue in the world with clean flushing toilets and proper sewage systems and urinal infections have very little to do with washing hands after using a toilet . 
  actual risk related to dirty hands is mostly in preparation of food . 
  crosscontamination of raw with cooked . 
  e. coli is just a evidence of a poor hygiene , it 's not really that dangerous itself . 
  sorry , but you are a prime example of an educated idiot . 
  you can perhaps name a few examples of well known but mostly harmless bacteria but then work with an idiotic assumption that rest of the world is a sterile environment . 
  it 's nothing more than a rationalization for your natural but irrational disgust . 
  yes , good hygiene can reduce transmission of pathogens , if there are a hygiene risk to begin with . 
  it just that toilets are safe . 
  if you think about it genitals are among the cleanest body parts . 
  they rarely ever get close to anything else but the clean underwear . 
  hands in contrast , organ for touching things , are far better environment for germs to spread . 
  biggest hygiene risk on the public toilets in my opinion are the door handles . 
  you wash your hands and immediately grab with your sticky wet hands the same dirty handle people are touching on their way in . 
  we are on / r/europe . 
  for years the idea that us overrected to 9/11 with policies that hurt civil liberties was very popular here . 
  this is so wrong for at least two reasons . 
  first , existence of the civil society dependent on those liberties . 
  state without civil society is nothing but instrument of power , which is on its own not worth defending at all . 
  not that france is in such state but this long state of emergency was certainly a step in the wrong direction . 
  second , authorities and ordinary citizens have fundamentally different interests . 
  whoever is in power have interest to consolidate more power . 
  it 's extremely important for any successful democracy to safeguard against that . 
  at the very least interest of the ordinary citizen for the power of state not to grow beyond reasonable limits should be voiced . 
  arguing against that is literally insane . 
  analogous to not defending yourself at court . 
   designed to shift france on to a greener footing ahead of next week 's climate change conference in paris , the adoption of a new energy law has instead alarmed the country 's powerful nuclear industry and raised fundamental questions about the country 's energy mix . 
   the long-awaited energy transition law was finally passed with nearly 1,000 amendments and after a gruelling 150 hours of parliamentary debate . 
   under the controversial legislation parliamentarians agreed to drastically reduce the country 's output of nuclear energy from 75 per cent of the current total to 50 per cent by 2025 . 
  they also committed to sizeable increases in the use of renewable energy to make up for the shortfall in nuclear energy production and targeted a 40 per cent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions . 
  overall energy consumption would fall by a fifth by 2030 under the new law . 
   but just four months after the law was passed , scepticism is mounting about whether the country can meet some of the key promises contained in the legislation , primarily the sharp reduction in nuclear energy output . 
   the energy debate has raised questions about the future of france 's nuclear industry , long a source of national pride , and comes on the eve of a climate conference in paris aimed at reaching a new global accord on reducing carbon emissions . 
   `` all the world is watching , '' said s\u00e9gol\u00e8ne royal , france 's energy minister , at a climate change event this month in paris . 
  `` changing the way we consume energy is key to our preparation for the climate summit . ''  but the commitment to cut the amount of nuclear power in the french energy mix over the next decade is creating a real headache for the government of president fran\u00e7ois hollande , who agreed the exacting target as part of an alliance with the green party in the 2012 presidential election . 
   developed in the 1970s , nuclear power stations were viewed as a way to secure france 's energy independence after the oil crisis in 1973 . 
  the adoption of nuclear technology quickly took off and nuclear power stations were built across the country but spiralling costs and mounting safety fears following the fukushima disaster in 2011 have undermined support for the industry . 
   `` the nuclear industry in france is facing a delicate moment , '' says jean-marc ollagnier , chief executive of accenture 's resources operating group . 
  `` the energy transition law is taking the country in the right direction , focusing on growing renewables in the energy mix . ''  the future of nuclear debate in france has echoes of a similar policy in germany -- known as energiewende -- which was designed to shift the country 's reliance on nuclear and fossil fuels towards renewable energy . 
  but controversially the policy has led to an increase in the use of coal . 
   according to some experts , france could have to close as many as two dozen nuclear reactors over the next decade to meet the target , costing billions , reducing capacity and almost certainly leading to higher electricity prices -- which are currently among the lowest in europe . 
   `` meeting the 50 per cent target by 2025 will likely be hugely expensive , '' says fran\u00e7ois l\u00e9v\u00eaque , economics professor at l\u2019ecole des mines in paris and author of the economics and uncertainties of nuclear power . 
   `` if power demand continues to decrease it could mean shutting down as many as a dozen profitable and safe reactors -- it 's just money down the drain , '' he says .

czechia , slovakia , hungary , romania did n't agree with your madness so i have no idea what `` agreed to take '' you mean . 
  we were overvoted , so please , be so kind and do n't try this s *** like `` you agreed '' . 
  some people may get triggered when a german talks about `` somebody agreed with something '' like munich agreement or so . 
  no , we will call it `` nato without turkey '', 
  i 'm not sure if you are trolling or ... 
  the amount of electric power to move vehicle that weights 38tons ( empty ) is enormous and batteries would n't be able to power your `` electric buses '' for usable amount of time . 
  ( and the recharge time would be so long that every city would need at least double the number of vehicles to switch them when charging others ) . 
  also batteries are made of expensive metals and needs to be recycled , this whole process is very expensive . 
  so `` overhead cables '' are needed . 
  also vehicle moving on trails have much smaller friction and therefore good energy efficiency . 
  to be honest , i did n't read anything so hilarious for very long time on the internet like sentence `` trams are basically buses but with all the disadvantages of trains . '', 
  just hilarious :d, 
  cz profits as well and in case of referendum , we would leave . 
  ( thats why our pm assured eu that there will be no referendum here ) the hate is strong around here . 
  in one of polls 80 % was for leave for some reason ... http://www.reflex.cz/clanek/anketa/72285/referendum-nanecisto-pro-odchod-ceska-z-eu-se-vyjadrilo-80-procent-hlasujicich.html that forced quota thing when we were overvoted last year did n't get accepted very well . 
  i think every nation that was in soviet block feels this way dear eesti . 
  it 's terrible thing to say , but i `` wish '' people in western europe had the same experience we have . 
  well , not really , but i think if they had the `` chance '' they would understand why we oppose this madness . 
  # 1bn , poor ee countries :( why ca n't we make money out of people killing other people like civilized west ? 
  but sure , it 's sa , they are nice guys and they definitely do n't supply syrian battlefields . 
  `` if they can do it , so can we '' is really bad and i do n't agree with selling arms to anyone but stuff like you post really triggers me . 
  first few results on google after entering `` saudi arabia arms deal '' https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/28/uk-weapons-sold-countries-poor-human-rights-saudi-arabia http://www.dw.com/en/controversial-exports-in-german-arms-report-newspaper/a-19374449 http://www.france24.com/en/20150624-france-saudi-arabia-deal-12bn, 
  dat czechs , always selling guns to terrorists . 
  force them change their gun laws via eu . 
  because it 's fault of guns , not the ones that decide to use gun againts other people or those willing to experiment with their people in reality show called `` will they integrate ? '', 
  i do n't remember being forced to use google search . 
  i can use yahoo search , bing search , i can use tons of czech search engines . 
  i have the choice to use them and let them advertise me their products . 
  i wo n't , because bing does n't even show czech pages , yahoo is even worse and czech search engines are so agressive with advertising their products in search results windows that they are unusable . 
  so , eu really punishes google for being too good at what they are doing . 
  they have multi-language support , they show results you actually looking for and yes , they advertise their other products , but in way less agressive way than other search engines . 
  only problem is , google is too good and too popular ...

  24 % of people have trust in european parliament and 29 % have trust in european union . 
  well it 's trust , not `` leave/not leave '' but you can make the image . 
  that evil twin did in fact bomb the boston marathon . 
  but we blamed poor chechnya and it worked !, 
  who would trust russian chechnya ? 
  being eastern european does n't sound so bad after seeing what modern west is doing last few years . 
  it 's quiet known here and we have czech dubbing of the series . 
  i really enjoy watching it .

  yeah , the cheapest workforce in europe , give us 1,5 $ / hour and we will die working and be glad for it,

  did you already ban trucks or are you waiting for more truck attacks ? 
  or maybe the problem is not availability of lethal weapons , but failed multicultural madness ?

  i 'm not saying which choice is correct , but this is question that will need to be answered . 
  `` come and rape , the worst thing that can happen to you is , that we will send you back to your country . '', 
  i do n't think that this is message i want europe to say . 
  i did . 
  f * ck terrorism , f * ck 2016 , f * ck all this f * cking `` interesting times '' . 
  i miss boring 2012 and it 's `` 21.12 . 
  2012 will the world end `` nonsense . 
  stay strong germans . 
  ca n't wait to see this in local news . 
  i just do n't get the logic here . 
  eu can `` punish '' vw eu-wide or leave it to each state to handle themselves . 
  what is eu doing now is that they leave it to each state , but if given state does n't perform the steps eu expects , they will be punished . 
  i have no idea why russians spend money on anti eu propaganda in this country , eu is doing great job on its own . 
  i would love to know how the question was translated and how big group of people was questioned . 
  next time you should say `` they are racist like czechs '' :d, 
  have a look at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/legality_of_child_pornography and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/legal_status_of_drawn_pornography_depicting_minors i did read a document about new european law that requires member countries to consider drawn child pornography on the same level as `` real one '' but it seems that some coutries with smarter law-makers made exceptions . 
  however it is illegal in most countries . 
  ( see first link , column `` finctional '' child pornography ) there are even books about loli anime and children protection laws ... the main question these book usually ask is `` how do you tell the character drawn on the paper is under 15/16/18 / 21 or whatever law is in given country '' the truth is that chunk of working population in europe could go to jail if these laws started to be enforced in some stupid way , because can you tell that all characters in that hentai you watched few weeks ago were over 15/16/18 / 21 ? 
  i was talking about anime lolicon - victimless crime . 
  and also about the article with plastic dolls . 
  i guess everybody who is able to lace his shoes understands that possession and creation of child pornography with real human beings should be punished . 
  the thing is that if there was legal option how to relieve needs caused by their mental sickness , such as plastic dolls or anime , the market for the `` real thing '' would drop a lot . 
  it 's not about protection of children . 
  it 's witchhunt of 21st century . 
  there are cases when somebody was imprisoned for possesing japan `` lolicon '' comics . 
  according to eu law , it does n't matter if it ' a real photo = serious abuse of children or anime . 
  you ca n't bash homosexuals or jews nowadays so the last sort of people you can witchhunt now are pedophiles . 
  ( even if they never abused anyone ), 
  did n't work much in poland , russia or ukraine . 
  yeah it is . 
  awesome book series . 
  does n't get attention it deserves though ... and some parts are too `` hardcore '' even for hbo to make it series like asoiaf . 
  did you read content of the page you just linked ? 
  i ca n't see anything related to what i wrote in there . 
  if you are trying to make some argument like `` countries are not allowed to protect their borders by any means necessary '' link a different page please . 
  i 'm not sure why people still do n't get it . 
  population in africa will continue to grow and so will the poverty , terrible life conditions and number of people not willing to live in such conditions . 
  we should be damn grateful that this micro-crisis is occuring now , when states of europe have lot 's of time to prepare themselves . 
  can you imagine a really bad natural disaster in africa in 1-2 years ? 
  milions of people would move north , to europe , because they see that all it takes to get to europe is board a inflatable raft , get few hundred meters from lybian shore and european taxi service frontex and ngo 's will take care of the rest - unload them on italian shore . 
  if you feel that eu is having problems handling few thousands of people , what will happen once thousands will become millions ? 
  you can ask me what i think is correct solution . 
  i do n't have one . 
  i can only tell , that in next few decades , europe will have to make choice if we want to be the good guys and keep importing people , impose permanent migrant quotas and fight with each other about who must take more , or we will become the bad guys and start protecting external borders of the eu . 
  `` how do we protect sea border ? '', 
  italy and greece asks . 
  ... how did you protect your sea border last 2000 years ? 
  it would take one referendum here ... sadly . 
  funny thing is that whenever i see a post on / r/europe mentioning czech republic , i feel like half of the posts are czechs discussing with each other in english . 
  well , why should italian goverment do anything about ngo 's ( and mafia ) smuggling when eu assures them that every migrant they ferry from libya to italy will be distributed to eu countries whether they like it or not .

  you 're very much rivaled by scandinavians , specially the danish though . 
  yep , i 've found out about that thanks to [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/b3e3v5f.png ) , 
  well , i guess it goes both ways . 
  to me polish sounds as if someone tried to speak czech but had a very strong speech defect . 
  slovakia our best friends . 
  all polls consistently show that over 90 % of us have favourable views of slovaks . 
  i 'm in that 90 % . 
  i love the country , love the nature , love the language and some of my best friends are slovaks . 
  i do n't even consider them foreigners . 
  poland i 've been to krakow , it 's a very beautiful city . 
  other than that i do n't have any personal experience with poles . 
  but generelly i have a good impression of them , they 're our v4 partner and we also trade with them a lot . 
  their language sounds hilarous . 
  austria awesome skiing destination and i absolutely adore vienna , it 's one of my most favourite cities . 
  actually the entire austria is very pretty . 
  austrians are really cool people , they sort of have all the typicaly good qualities that people usually connect with germany without having any of the negative qualities . 
  germany well ... they 're cool i guess . 
  no , seriously , they 're a great business partner , so please germany , keep your economy working , ok ? 
  all the german people i met were very nice , polite . 
  berlin is a pretty cool city . 
  dresden is also very nice . 
  also the biggest tourist group in prague are germans , so considering their numbers , they 're very well-behaved , you hardly ever hear about german tourists getting shitfaced drunk in the city centre , which ca n't be said for certain other group of tourists . 
  the great divides of wealth are only a thing in some eastern european countries . 
  in others , it 's completely the other way around - the societies are very egalitarian ( partly a communism legacy , which survived in some ee countries even after the turbulent 90s ) . 
  just look at this [ grap ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/employment_social/social_monitor/images/ineq_3.png ) , which shows the gini index in eu countries , which is most widely used for measuring income inequality . 
  the first three countries with the lowest gini index is slovakia , slovenia and the czech republic . 
  poland and hungary are also in the first half . 
  only the baltic countries , romania and bulgaria are in the second . 
  well you have missed out a lot !, 
  the good news is that you can still watch it on [ youtube ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhcmnr1bu2q ) . 
  no need to be afraid of language barrier , since the characters do n't speak at all , 
  yep , it 's a czechoslovak cartoon . 
  i totally adored it as a kid . 
  i did n't know it was known abroad as well . 
  no way , you know pat & mat ? 
  i did n't know that was a thing in croatia as well . 
  oh man , i knew about croatia , did n't know that we managed to make ourselves famous in slovenia as well . 
  but it makes sense , slovenia is popular destination among young czechs to do hydrospeed , rafting , canyoning and this kind of activities . 
   for many austrians , the former eastern european countries are popular cheap shopping or day-trip destinations . 
  that 's why bratislava is often jokingly called `` gratislava '' ; gratis being german for `` for free '' . 
   that 's funny , because bratislava is now actually more expensive than prague , the adoption of euro had probably something to do with that . 
  i have slovak friends who live in brno and go to work to bratislava every day by train because they find it more afforable this way ( and also because they just like brno more ) . 
  yeah , i know we have this reputation in other countries as well , that 's why i think there is some truth in it . 
  there is just a group of czech tourists who are rather adventurous and know-it-alls at the same time . 
  they 're convinced that they have everything under control and do n't need to listen to any security measures . 
  they 're a minority though , they only get a disproportial amount of attention due to their stupidity , the normal tourists wo n't get noticed . 
  we sometimes jokingly call slovakia upper hungary . 
  this is of course because they were part of the hungarian part of austria-hungary before czechoslovakia became independent and they still have hungarian minority . 
  usually when making this joke , we will pretend like we do n't even know that slovakia exists and when someone mentions it in a conversation , we act confused and ask if the meant upper hungary instead . 
  slovaks also make fun of us , specially of our tourists , since there 's a stereotype ( and probably there 's some truth in it ) that czech tourists go ridiculously unprepared to slovak mountains while being overly-confident of their abilities only to inevitably get in trouble and being in need of rescue ( or even get themselves killed in the most extreme cases ) . 
  so then whenever there 's some case of czech tourists needing to be rescued in slovakia , it 's met with responses like `` oh , what did they do this time , did they go to the mountains in flip flops ? 
  did they bring just one small bottle of water with them ? 
  did they ignore all avalanche warnings ? '', 
  and so on . 
  other than that , we probably do n't have special rivalries with our other neighbours , we just sometimes make fun of the classic stereotypes - polish people are overly religious and germans have no sense of humour . 
  i ca n't think of any stereotypes/jokes about austrians really , there are just generally liked here and held in high regard , which goes for slovaks as well , only with austrians we do n't have such a close relationship , so i guess there 's just no need to poke fun at them . 
  reading your post made me feel sick that people like you have to now worry about their future . 
  i absolutely understand your concerns and i would be having exactly the same thoughts in your place . 
  the tragic thing is of course that if people like you leave ( and i would not blame you at all ) , turkey will be really lost . 
  but anyway , if you do n't have any relatives in the eu , it will probably not be very easy to come here . 
  non-eu foreigners usually need some specific skills to be allowed to come , or some company has to hire them , but first needs to prove that they have n't been able to find an eu-worker for the position . 
  i do n't know about other eu countries , but at least here in cz there are special kind of freelance visa , which do not require any special skills . 
  plenty of young foreigners use these visa to live in prague , they usually teach english or other languages , which does n't make a lot of money , but then if you 're in your early 20s , you share an apartment with a bunch of friends and you only have yourself to provide for , you do n't need a big salary to live a comfortable life in prague . 
  for those who do n't want to only spend a couple of exciting years in prague and then move on , the freelance visa are often only for a transitional period , before they can find a better job , get a pernament resident permit and settle down . 
  you might want to check out if this is also available in other eu countries where you would like to move in . 
  northwestern europe is of course the best in terms of living standard , you would only have to get used to a slightly different climate  and also , it 's very sad , but the western europe has its own problems with islamists as well , so you would not be escaping that completely . 
  perhaps you could also consider other non-european countries , like canada , australia or the us . 
  as others have said , this would be an eu issue and if the us wanted to exclude some members , then i do n't think it would be acceptable , even if the us threatened us with economic consequences . 
  and how could the us even do that ? 
  the eu and the us economy are approximately the same size and are very connected , so if the us wanted to economicaly hurt the eu , they would be hurting themselves as well . 
  if this ( just hypotheticaly ) was decided on the national level and the us were interested in having a freedom of movement with us , then i do n't think they would have to `` order '' us to accept it , we would probably be quite happy to accept it anyway . 
  what bad consequences could that possibly have ? 
  brain drain ? 
  do n't think so , we are already free to move anymore in the western europe , where the salaries are also much higher , and not that many czechs do so . 
  those who wanted out already had the chance to leave , adding the us to the mix would n't really drastically change the situation . 
  plus czechs have a habbit of coming back from abroad eventually and that would be a big asset for us in the long term to have these people with the experience from the us to return . 
  sure , some people would leave for good , but maybe we would also get more young americans interested in living in europe . 
  we would obviously not be the top destination , but at least for those in their early or mid 20s with little savings , prague could be an attractive place , since it 's still quite cheap compared to western european cities . 
  unlike western european countries , we would not have to be worried to get flooded with americans wanting european welfare , because let 's face it , if someone were to come to europe for welfare , they would not be going to cz . 
  so yep , i think freedom of movement with the us could only be positive for us . 
  hey , i 'm not sure how it 's in italy , but over here birth control ( both hormonal and non-hormonal ) is not covered by the health insurance and you have to pay for it yourself . 
  basically you need to go to see a doctor ( a gynecologist ) and he/she gives you perscription and then you can go to any pharmacy to pick up the pills ( it 's usually around 25-40 eur for three months here , but the prices probably differ in each country ) . 
  as for gynefix - it 's available in my country , but not every doctor does it . 
  basically you have to check whether the doctor has the authority to do this and if he/she does , then you have to pay for that too ( it 's around 130 eur here ) . 
  but that 's just my country , i could be different in other countries . 
  i would not say it 's completely impossible . 
  i guess it differs in each country , but at least here in prague , there are quite a lot of non-eu expats , a lot of them teach english which can be done through a freelancer permit , which is easier to get than the normal working visa . 
  as for the regular working visa , it 's true that an employer has to first prove the job ca n't be done by anyone else in the eu , but the proving procedure only consists of putting the job advert in the system and then if no one with the right qualification within the eu applies , they 're free to offer the position to a foreigner . 
  so it really does n't mean that they actively search in the whole eu for a person who could do the job , they are just offering it first to the european citizens and in some fields it can very well happen that from those who are interested nobody fullfils the requirements and those who do fullfill the requirements might not be interested . 
  so i would not give up so easily if this is really what you want . 
  if i were you i would check out european countries which have low unemployment and then starting to look for job adverts in your field and possibly start replying , since this is really the only way to get the visa - you firstly need a job offer from an employer . 
   i 've noticed estern europe reacted a lot like the way western europe did after the second world war , kind and welcoming . 
  yeah , there are definitely many people in ee who are very welcoming of us troops , that 's pretty obvious when you just check this and last year 's pictures and videos from dragoon rides . 
  however we have our own anti-american part of population as well . 
  they are by no way the majority , but they do exist . 
  and at the same time , i 'm pretty sure many western europeans are still pro-us , particularly in the uk . 
  so it 's not really black and white . 
  but anyway , i also hope the relationship will stay strong , specially since we in the ee nowadays look with a bit of concern at the tendencies of the us to go back to isolationism . 
  well , you know you should n't take this too personally . 
  it 's just that us foreign policy is controversial and the us military is one of the main tools of us foreign policy .

  so no cuts to goverment spending . 
  that infuriates me . 
  right now , we have 4 % real gdp growth . 
  and 1,9 % budget deficit . 
  it makes no sense . 
  we should balance our budget and maybe go into suplus , to pay our debts . 
  because we never know when next crisis would hit us . 
  why are we only so short-sighted ? 
  our major banks are not responsible because of good intensions . 
  they are responsible because our central bank would cut their balls if they found even a slight shortcoming , not to mention a fraud , or too much hazard or other irresponsibility . 
  our central bank is ferociously independent and transparent . 
  our parlament tried several times to sway it , because of political reasons . 
  no chance in hell . 
  our goverment has exactly zero influence on our cnb . 
  and this is good . 
  ecb must stay neutral , independent on the eu and member \u00b4 s parliaments , if it should do good job . 
  it also must be transparent and always consistent in its decisions . 
  and this is pending now . 
  ecb is prolonging ela beyond what it has mandate to do . 
  and this decision , not tocut ela , is a political one . 
  and that is wrong . 
  ecb must behave independently on what politicians and electrorates want . 
  it must behave only on valid rules and laws . 
  otherwise , euro is doomed , because of lost trust . 
  i know that czech national bank has strict control over all czech banks . 
  they have several hundert employees , whose only job is to audit our banks . 
  constantly . 
  they go from branch to branch , from one headquarter to another , and they make audits , from ceos to last counter clerk . 
  by law , licensed banks must allow them access to all documents . 
  be it employee contracts , mortage contracts with clients , forex , derivatives , or rent of their parking spots . 
  our central bank gives them orders about increase of capitalisation , about types of collaterals they can accept , mortages they can offer , insurance they must pay , banks cant pay dividends or other large transfers without approval of cnb . 
  just because central banks in other countried do terrible job , doesnt mean czech central bank must too . 
  we got wiser from our 90s lesson . 
  of course , no risk can be eliminated for 100 % , but it can be extremelly minimalized . 
  thank you for buying our products . 
  i think that the gap between our countries is getting smaller , not wider . 
  poland is doing really good job , my respect to you guys . 
  the secret behind local success of \u0160koda is a mix of affordable price , good quality , cheap spare parts , and effort to support high employment rate . 
  czech koruna is pegged to euro since 2013 . 
  slovakia is doing equally well , despite really being in euro . 
  euro is not the poison . 
  poison is euro mixed with fiscal irresponsibility or other huge unbalance/bubble . 
  at this point , i want our country to stay out of euro for another few years , while observing what is going on in ez and ecb . 
  but truth is that our exports are 80 % sold to ez countries . 
  germany alone makes something like 30 % . 
  we are bound with germany by umbilical cord . 
  there is a reason for some to call us the 17th bundesland . 
  so , even if we wont accept euro ( people here really dislike that idea ) , our currency will stay pegged one way or another , maybe similar to denmark . 
  so you would prefer a complete collaps of banking sector in at least 4 eu countries ? 
  do you even understand what for a catastrophe it would be for their citizens ? 
  the czech goverment was forced to bail out czech banks in 90s . 
  at that time , my opinion was negative , if it would depend on me , i would let them collaps . 
  my uni professor at that time had an opinion that bank stability is more important , even if all czechs had to pay the bill . 
  we had an dissagreement that we battled about , and both stayed unchanged of their opinion then . 
  the fun fact is , i have changed opinion since then , after realising what could have happened then . 
  and my old professor is now our czech finance minister , btw . 
  and all local banks are under very rigid observation and control of our central bank , with strict rules put on them . 
  czech banks has been very stable since 90s . 
  we learnt our lession the hard way , after we got sent a huge bill . 
  this is just a reminder , that europe doesnt consist only of greece . 
  most europeans countries are doing very well . 
  eu tries to find a way that would be least painful for greece . 
  if that fails , greeks will really suffer , similar to argentina or venezuela . 
  but greece is independent to make a choice.s o all we can do is close borders and offer humanitarian aid . 
  in slovakia , the schengen border means a wild uninhabited national park on both borders with war-torn and close-to financial collaps ukraine . 
  slovakia is fullfilling its obligations in guarding schengen border . 
  unlike italy . 
  you know it is funny . 
  eu is trying to save greek ass from full uncontroled default , with all it contains . 
  against greek will . 
  and now they realised that greece is so headstrong that eu will fail in its attempts . 
  so the only thing we can do , is to prepair humanitarian aid . 
  this was out of question for greece anymore , with their falling gdp . 
  there are countries that decided to have balanced budgets . 
  switzerland , germany , estonia , to name european examples . 
  but they started in good times . 
  your table is wrong , or rather it is not complete debt . 
  czech republic sent 1 bln euro to imf as 1 % loan from our state reserves . 
  a good portion was used in greece . 
  but it doesnt change anything on my statement . 
  countries like slovakia wont help greece anymore . 
  they are not naive like germans are . 
  germans still believe in solidarity with greece . 
  but any new bailout or debt cut wont be able to pass slovak pairlament anymore . 
  you cant imagine how angry people are in countries like slovakia , slovenia or baltics . 
  their fms wont give a single cent to greece anymore , unless they want to face riots in their countries . 
  there might be , but are pretty rare . 
  i understand it differently . 
  he promised to greeks that they will still have euro , but most of the debt will be cancelled . 
  when i see what germans get back for their help and all the money they funnel into greece - only hate and ingratitude , i pity them . 
  please , germans , dont pay too much attention to it , and just stay professional . 
  europe right now depends on you and your cold head , apparently . 
  this is the reason greece is fucked . 
  you are mistaken , it is greece that wants to stay in ez . 
  syriza was voted in because they promised greece can stay in ez . 
  bond yields of other southern eu countries already contain the possibility of greek default . 
  there mighht be an increase , but not enough to tumble them seriously . 
  most eu countries are recovering their economy . 
  again , greek default is not unexpected , and it wont cause big panic . 
  volaility yes , but not fatal .

  kral/kr \u00e1l means king in multiple languages , not just serbian .

  why do neonazis always use red , black and white , regardless of their nationality ? 
  it makes them look so ominous . 
  why not use bright , happy colours instead ? 
  the combination of blue , white and yellow looks really pleasing to the eye . 
  edgy . 
  you ignore the fact there have been five freaking crusdes called on bohemia during that time . 
  blaming it all on hussites , as radical as they were , is dishonest . 
  actually , if you look closely you 'll notice there are at least two inconspicuously placed , heavily muscled bodyguards propping him up from behind, 
  what about bosniaks ? 
  they are slavs , most eat pork and drink beer yet they are muslim . 
  how do they fit in your spectrum ? 
  not sure why you 're downvoted , you are absolutely right . 
  does this mean that as an atheist , i am not european ? 
  weird , i swar it was in italian when i opened it first .

  would you rather fight a horse-sized duck , or hundred duck-sized horses ? 
  the mehmet-class inter-continental missiles . 
  that does n't say much though . 
  the guy changes his opinion like an underwear . 
  pretty much . 
  technically it was though . 
   denmark quick , we need some articles shaming denmark !, 
  what the fuck is that website ? 
  oh come on . 
   sloven\u010dina  sloven\u0161\u010dina you are doing this on purpose , are n't you ? 
  pretty much the same here . 
  you tried . 
  just the polish victim complex in action . 
  you were fighting soviets , we were fighting hungarians . 
  in the meantime , you were trying to quietly annex the whole t\u011b\u0161\u00ednsko , breaking the treaty between our countries concerning the area . 
  sure , an armed response might not have been a most sensible , few things were during that time . 
  it served its purpose . 
  but please , do n't let me distract you from your self-victimization . 
  huh . 
  i wonder how many transgender people we have in our army . 
  makes sense . 
  witcher is basically a fantasy version of central europe .

  what would this sub be without its daily dose of outrage . 
  it 's called fakt , so it must be true . 
  peanut butter is pretty good . 
  i actually prefer it to nutella and similar stuff . 
  i do n't think ukrainians would have any problem in differentiating between those two languages . 
  muh christian values !, 
  that 's not true . 
  it really depends on person . 
  many people use former , many people prefer latter . 
  do n't worry , polish is just as funny to us . 
  no civil war . 
  just the end of eu . 
  it sounds cheap because it 's still fresh change . 
  give it ten years and no one will care . 
  the word czechia itself is pretty old :  the term `` czechia '' is attested as early as 1569 in latin and 1841 in english ( poselkynie starych przjbiehuw czeskych - messenger of the old fates of czechia ) . 
  other early uses occurred in 1856 or in an 1866 report on the austro-prussian war . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/name_of_the_czech_republic#english-language_name might be you 've gotten the word from there . 
   there was a movie about battle of britain where main heroes were ... czechs what are you implying there ? 
  czechoslovak pilots were just as important as the polish ones . 
  if you 're talking about the [ dark blue world ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0244479/ ) , the director was a czech himself . 
  of course the main heroes would be czechs . 
  the cartel . 
  unfortunately , the eu is against cat . 
  yeah . 
  from the article , it seems the biggest beef the locals have is with the massive cruise ships that park figuratively in the middle of the city and release hordes of turists that swarm the centre like locusts . 
  keep the news coming . 
  this sub needs more slovakia . 
  babi\u0161 will always do whatever gives him the most votes , however he is rational enough not to do anything that would sabotage the cash flow from eu . 
  which is why he keeps quiet about migrant crysis , and deliberately vague about euro adoption . 
  he is pro-eu , but does n't present himself so overtly because majority of his voters are n't . 
  call is spinelessness , or pragmatism . 
  he is a populist , first and foremost . 
  this . 
  i find that pro-euthanasia crowd hardly ever thinks about what impact does it have on doctors , who are supposed to be responsible for ending the lives . 
  i wonder why there is that orange `` island '' of lower lactose intolerance in the central europe .

  except slovaks themselves . 
  source : studying in moravia . 
  looks like monday . 
  in other news , water is wet . 
  were n't scythians indo-european people related to modern iranians ? 
  ah , the nomadic horde approach . 
  than they should change the constitution to allow it instead of hiding behind it . 
  and therefore very gorgeous . 
  there is more policemen there than actual protestors lol . 
  just a small taste of the bizarre world of czech politics . 
  and here i thought we could go a week without another plc post . 
  it 's been more than 600 years . 
  one would have thought we could discuss the event without greeks having stinking loser attitude about it . 
  a testament to roman laziness when it comes to naming foreign territories . 
  i did n't say we were . 
  also the wiki article you posted is a bit too one sided to my liking , as it omits the provocation and rampant propaganda from the polish side at the time . 
  it worked out great did n't it ? 
  an army which he promptly absorbed into wehrmacht to use in invasion of france .
