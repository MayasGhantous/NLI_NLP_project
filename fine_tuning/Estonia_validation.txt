  the amount of corruption , not the money involved . 
  as west is richer and you could suspect bigger sums in every aspect . 
  except in russia and nk the dictators wealth is beyond any proportions you have in west . 
  i know there 's corruption in eu - you are stating the obvious . 
  but the difference with russia is astronomical . 
  i lived through the transformation of estonia personally . 
  the cleansing from corruption was astonishing . 
  and we are not even close to scandinavian level . 
  saying everyone is corrupt and trying to leave an impression that all countries are on the same level is just lame . 
  might as well say all countries are north korea . 
  countries differ , and they differ in amount that actually matters . 
  yes . 
  i am against russias imperialistic ambitions . 
  i do n't mind putin messing around in his own borders , but i dislike the fact russia is annexing countries in 21st century and imposing its bs onto sovereign neighbors . 
  if only russia would be more like eu ( productive , liberal and relatively low level of corruption ) i would n't mind joining their eurasia . 
  but right now they are exactly opposite - unproductive , corrupt and authoritarian . 
   unless war has already been started by nato countries arming ukraine for your information war is already going on for a while . 
  russia invaded crimea and then eastern ukraine . 
  you have all mixed up . 
   that would leave russia no choice but to fight back . 
  quite the opposite . 
  russia is leaving no choice for nato . 
  putin has been pushing his invasion for a while now without any signs of stopping . 
  which i think is great . 
  if theres no rules for russia , i hope west will treat putin like he does west . 
  just deny any involvement ... 
  history shows appeasing nationalistic dictatorships do n't work - without consequences they keep pushing . 
  you say russia would stop with ukraine . 
  but what is the base for your claim ? 
   starts to quietly attack those nato members who gave arms to ukraine . . all out war in europe . . you letting your imagination run pretty wild  us profits from selling both side arms . . wow . 
  in estonia we often refer finland as an older brother . 
  if i was defense minister i so would use the opportunity to cheerfully state ukrainian army buying arms in supermarket . 
  i kind of agree with your thoughts . 
  but you mention that russia has nothing to gain starting full scale war . 
  i 'm thinking russia has done quite a lot lately that could be put in the category of `` negative gain '' . 
  still messing about in eastern ukraine could be considered as not productive for future . 
  but russia still does it . 
  and my thoughts are that putin is not russia , he is not seeking best for russia , but rather that he constantly has to cement his power . 
  its what dictators do . 
  it might cost russia a lot , but putin has no other choice , he created the throne where there is no turning back . 
  and so , in that context . 
  i can see russia doing something pretty wacky . 
  plus , lets take into account how the west with pleasure plays along the game of `` civil war '' when appetite for conflict with russia is zero . 
  would west go to war for a small chunk of land lets say in finland , or estonia ? 
  and i 'm sure we are not the only ones who wonder ... 
  i can see that my sentence can look bad at first . 
  but dont get me wrong , i precisely wrote that something semi-radical has to be done with immigration , that means policy ( not the immigrants ) . 
  and i wrote it in the context of present situation where even stopping the current flow might be seen as quite radical ( racist ? ) . 
  i live in estonia , we do n't have the same problems that more developed eu countries have . 
  we have a risk of little green men . 
  but there 's no asian or african refugees here . 
  i 'd love to see some here too as i actually am defender of multiculturalism . 
  but developed eu looks like have reached the limit ( for now ) and if it keeps going the same road i see some dark days ahead ( i really hope i 'm wrong tho ) . 
  nope . 
  i 'm half-russian . 
  i very much dislike putins politics , and it shows , i 'm ok with that . 
  nevertheless i had a point , that was meant to be general . 
  if country is number 1 in education ( be them russians or whoever ) ** but ** are not on top of the world with rest of stuff ( like economy , culture - crime , corruption ) there must be something besides education that makes a country prolific and successful or there is something wrong with the way the chart is made . 
  maybe . 
  but i think there has been problem evasion for some time now . 
  left has been ignoring certain trends and i can see the whole anti-immigration blowing into monster some time in the future . 
  5 years ago it was unthinkable that so many far-right politicians will be voted for in eu elections . 
  and even now with the visible change in the politics there are so many people saying the numbers are wrong its too simplistic etc. 
  i 'm very worried where will we be in 5 years . 
  i despise nationalism . 
  but at the same time i start seeing that right wing has been better than the left at predicting europe 's problems . 
  right wing is rising to power and if we do n't do something semi-radical with immigration now they will do radical in the future . 
   mydealz.de thanks !, 
  guy on the left has underwear on his head ? 
  well thats truly surprising and fascinating . 
  i guess education not helping them much since russia is such a shithole ( sorry russia , lets not fool ourselves economically and culturally not the best place on earth . 
  at least empirically judging not many people want to emigrate to russia . 
  and do n't get me wrong . 
  i 'm estonian , i 'm happy with a lot of things in my country , but its also relatively a shithole . 
  regardless of our super duper e-infrastructure it is not a country everyone runs to live in . 
  although at least we are heading in the right direction . 
  russias soviet reunion is gon na flop , and all this education is going to be even less relevant . ), 
  i like the irony how pro-russians keep reminding that current government is not democratic . 
  how is that even an argument coming from russian side ? 
  agree . 
  it 's probably too costly to fight in western ukraine . 
  i imagine in west there would be much more people willing to join the army to protect independence and i have a feeling not so much russian people are willing to go to war with ukraine . 
  and putin is not yet stalin to be able to make them . 
  it 's actually almost a traditional thing for russia . 
  they 've been fabricating trials to communicate a message ( mostly a threat ) since the beginning of ussr . 
  russia is run by thugs using state institutions as a decor . 
   so his opinions on art are wrong ? 
  well , if he says art can not be critical most probably his opinion goes beyond art . 
  authoritarian states do n't like critical art because censorship is needed . 
  yeah , the whole world is pro-russian . 
   ah , our regular bi-weekly `` why hungary sucks '' self-post is finally here . 
   i do n't hold any particular love towards orb\u00e1n or his party , but this is getting ridiculous . 
  i would say opposite , your type of comment is something that always comes with these type of news . 
  i guess it makes sense as you probably agree with orbans `` censor '' school of thought - `` lets not criticize hungarys move towards authoritarian state '' . 
  there is definitely anti-russian sentiment in the west ( i 'd say justified , or do you suggest people should favor russias latest politics against their will ? 
  not to make too exaggerated comparisons , but are you bothered people being biased against isis . 
  at least west reacts based on the values . 
  some countries lack any freedom of press and create news only what autocrat dictates . . winkwink ) . 
  plus . 
  like u/vdale already said , no reason to lump all west in one .

  seriously ? 
  because of history of warfare and a natural competition between you two ? 
   as you stay within your own borders for the next 71 years hey , look !, 
  we have an optimist here !, 
  the question that should really be asked : is anyone surprised ? 
  marginalizing and ridiculing religion and a fundamental separation of church and state work the best . 
  not really delusional about that . . 
  it 's not about you understanding them , it 's about everybody understanding the standard form . 
  oh i 'm sure the russians tried to implement a common language of their own ... 
  really depends where . 
  the hills start from southern estonia mostly , so most of estonia is as flat as the netherlands . 
  my 85 year old grandmother said she does n't even remember such a warm early winter . 
  as a true tallinner , i have never heard of that rest of estonia . 
  and as a true estonian , i still hate the weather . 
  well , as an atheist through and through , i can not agree with that . 
  their policies were way too harsh . 
  they repressed certain religious minorities ( like jehova 's witnesses ) , tore down churches under heritage protection , banned celebrating christmas , wrote down the names of children , who went to churches on christmas and later found ways to dealing with them etc. 
  even if it was n't it probably would n't much hurt us . 
  it 's not like they would ally with russia or anything ... 
  i only said i disagree with the latter point and we should treat them equally by our standards , not equally by the standards of their countries . 
  i never said anything about us bending the knee as said in his first two points . 
  assimilation happens only if you are half-russian or if there are no other russians nearby . 
  integration is what one should strive for !, 
  [ relevant estonian humor ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwlkilxbghg ) . 
  it was the background music of some estonian 4x4 travelers in the far east . 
  still a favorite , 
  that 's where my great grandfather was sent to die . 
  he worked in gold mines ( as usual ) and eventually died of lung cancer ( as usual ) , two years before his promised release . 
  if it never existed , there would be another  coming from a country 's capital myself and not living there at the moment , i do get how people from the capitals/biggest cities tend to overvalue their city over the rest of the country . 
  well , just consider taking people from all over your country and stretching them out to populate thousands of kilometers of narrow wilderness . 
  would they be different from the average ? 
  not so much . 
  would their lives there affect their regional social characteristics ? 
  of course . 
   federal city = civilization nice one :d, 
  worked wonders . 
  who would n't want to move to a desolate siberian region next to the chinese border in the 1930s ? 
  i really thought it was estonia . 
  i have this feeling that people in the baltics empathize more with eastern russians because we feel there are more descendants of repressed people ( including our ethnic groups ) , plus they are more against putin 's regime . 
  are n't you also claiming that since they are all the same people that they should belong to serbia ? 
  i 've heard many finns pointing out this is fake in some way and that finland indeed was ahead in gdp per capita back then . 
  oh trust me , we would have more of these jokes . . :d, 
  and consider the situation in 1991 ... 
  post socialist regions in europe are relatively divided by religion . 
  while it was repressed in most parts and it worked , it was also used as a tool of protest against the socialist system in some countries ( say lithuania ) , where religion today again plays a moderate role . 
  however in other countries ( say estonia ) , religion just never recovered and probably never will . 
  after all , [ 89 % of young estonians are irreligious ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d1/religious_differences_in_estonia.png ) . 
   muslims can seek religious rights and privileges in non-muslim countries , but non-muslims who seek the same rights and privileges in muslim countries will be laughed away or harmed . 
  this is the only one i disagree with . 
  we are not muslim countries , nor are we dictatorships . 
  as these people do n't live in those countries anymore ( and perhaps for a good reason ) , they should not be treated by the standards of the country they escaped from . 
  i get it , but i still think that original  dubbing in any case . 
  that falling part is again weird because in relative terms it has remained mostly the same , plus this year was an increase for estonia due to immigration . 
  and in gdp per capita lithuania is doing better than estonia as estonia is not growing so strongly . 
  however in most other aspects , including hdi , we are quite a little ahead of lithuania and latvia indeed . 
  that 's a tad bit different issue . 
  although there may be a lot of corruption within the center party , that 's not the main problem with their rule . 
  it 's rather the legal reasons , like the municipal propaganda channel and unintelligent politics due to their absolute majority in the town council . 
  nationalities and ethnic groups definitely have a collective consciousness due to relatively restricted communication with mainly within your own nationality or ethnic group . 
  plus history tends to affect people of the same nationality/ethnic group in a similar way , so all have similar experiences within their families . 
  and when before did western europeans propose to fix a crisis with more problems ? 
  i can also compare my post socialist capital region with the netherlands , but this does n't mean my whole country is on the same level ... 
  it 's sort of weird though , like do the swiss germans really not consider themselves germans by ethnicity ? 
  i think it was somehow privately verbally referred to in some vague context , but it has been way misrepresented in russian media , like everything else of course . 
  be collectively against a destructive social policy you meant . 
  that 's not about solidarity , i 'd be very willing to collectively provide more into eu border defending , but if they willfully allow people to come in and stay , then we have a problem . 
  we agreed to be in a union with these countries , not with external groups . 
  their cooperation is fully opening their markets and abiding to mostly western european - created laws , which have made possible for them to buy up much of eastern europe as they have more resources for it . 
  plus , the problem was rather that there has n't been a particular problem like that for 12 years , but now that we have a problem with one policy , we are labeled as refusing to do our roles in the eu . 
  that 's why it 's ridiculous . 
  that 's why the dutch also have good english skills . 
  i think that 's what sets many countries apart in europe on english proficiency . 
  i agree that integrated people should have citizenships , however no way are all russians integrated , not even all the children born after estonia 's independence . 
  and well , i agree that they are not here illegally as of now , as their staying here has been sanctioned by the estonian government . 
  this does not change the fact that they were illegals upon estonia 's independence . 
  plus , sanctioning their staying here was relatively unpopular in estonia and it was done mostly in order to get russian troops out of estonia , which was a bigger and more imminent threat . 
  in the eu all eu residents can vote in municipal elections , that 's why . 
  many russians are indeed the `` little green men '' mentality . 
  if you have n't been here and do n't know what they are like , then i kindly ask you to stop your nonsense . 
  your case law was ridiculous and that 's it . 
  plus , estonian law is not us law - works on laws , not on ridiculous example cases . 
  fine , i do n't know what to think anymore . 
  i was angrily confronted on the issue when i generalized on the difficulties of integrating the muslims ... 
   unlike the baltics , are not suffering from brain drain that much do n't that much equate all three baltic states that much . 
  most estonians , who have left , have gone to finland or sweden , which is close enough for many to retain some lives in estonia . 
  weather really depends on what you prefer . 
  i would not like to live in 30 + c weather for example ... 
  all post-socialist states have [ some ] popular politicians from the socialist times . 
  as the communist and socialist parties were the only allowed parties , many good people were active in them , and eventually split the parties from inside , so their past party membership is not seen as something definitely negative . 
  i rather think the problem is the people , who got into politically influential positions or became wealthy businessmen in the early 1990s , which was a really chaotic time in the baltic states , which huge corruption and mob influence . 
  however the most successful examples have never been caught with corruption and they continue to be influential on mostly regional level . 
  and these people are mostly ethnic estonians/latvians , which is not to say that there are n't as many or more corrupted russians . 
  the latvian estonia-fandom is sometimes ridiculous though . 
  it sometimes seems like `` estonia doing better anyway '' is seen as an excuse for not being able to do the same in latvia . 
  that could very well be . 
  i imagine a lot less reluctance in accepting syrian refugees had western europeans not accepted so many other immigrants from [ muslim ] africa . 
  it 's just a cultural thing then i guess . 
  i saw some latvian television last year and was surprised by the amount of dubbing in it . 
  then again , some 35 year old latvian guys had trouble speaking english with me ... 
  yeah , i think i even remember the medication article controversy .

  so democracy can work in russia and in ukraine , and i believe would work better . 
  why do you worship your putin oligarchic system ? 
  you are the most unequal society in europe . 
  you have much more money than before , but most of it circulates in pockets of selected oligarchs ? 
  go suffer for your motherland , those fat pigs tell you . 
  is n't that ridiculous ?!, 
   ukraine threw itself under the bus . 
  ukraine is an independent country and russia ca n't be responsible for their self-harming behavior . 
  i think grabbing a big part of their land , as well as arming separatists counts harming them big time . 
   the eu is naturally much stronger magnet than russia . 
  sure , but look at us , we 're much closer to russia than the wealth centre of europe -- germany . 
  st. petersburg is just 130 km from estonian border . 
  that 's 4 times the people our entire country has . 
  russia has always been the most important market for estonia . 
  yet today , trade with russia is rather small , it 's known for heavily politicised and unstable market . 
  meanwhile , our exports wo n't be cut off if we happen to not treat a monument the way brussels wants , nor will they be screaming for `` cut the fascists parasites '' . 
   and third , russia has fine relations with most of its neighbors . 
  most of its undemocratic neighbours , you mean . 
   wants to have independent foreign policy and promotes idea of multi-polar world the first one , everyone should be fine about that . 
  the second one , if that `` multi-polar world '' means you 'll select a sphere of influence for your own , then no way . 
   it 's sorta fundamental conflict , it ca n't be easily resolved with for example removal of putin . 
  unfortunately , that seems to be true . 
   one-sided western view on russia always annoys me you know , it 's absurd to look at russia as a victim here . 
  we have the world 's largest country yet again going for some land-grabbing and pretending they 're only `` defending '' themselves . 
  it 's like that never-ending story of how russia has always protected itself and became the world 's largest country that way . 
  not to mention you have swallowed finno-ugric nations who are doing horribly in russia . 
  meanwhile , we have alfred rosenberg . 
  he was born and studied in tallinn , although left estonia when estonians won the war and republic of estonia was established ( he had clearly hoped for german victory instead ) . 
  [ here ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/european-union/gdp-per-capita-ppp ) you are . 
  it 's at highest levels ever right now . 
   actually have n't used my passport in 4 years , and i travel around europe quite a bit . 
  up until this year , i did n't even own a valid passport for years . 
  yes , it says `` constant [ prices ] '' there . 
  if it was `` current prices '' , it would not be adjusted for inflation . 
   my assumption is that it 's largely believed that the most pro- ` federalist ' countries are/were the original founders of the eec i thought that as well but finland and sweden ? 
  do n't have the impression that they 're among the most enthusiastic euro-integrationers . 
   even though i know countries such as in the baltics are generally strongly pro-european , there is a sense that they 'd be less willing to give up that kind of national sovereignty largely due to having only , fairly recently , regained independence . 
  if finland and sweden went on that path , baltics would surely follow . 
  there 's no way we 'd risk even slightly with being left with russia . 
  economically , baltics are surely interested in as close integration as possible . 
  i do n't think values are that much of an issue either ( though clearly , there are still differences ) . 
  however , there 's one issue absolutely unacceptable here . 
  that 's any kind of forced demographic change , no matter how tiny or for whatever fair reason , it 's just out of the question . 
  then again , i 'm sure it 's a problem for every european country , so unless they want far-rights to the government , that wo n't happen . 
   funny how i 'm getting down-voted for relying what the article is saying even though that 's not even my opinion . 
  i do n't know what 's up with that , i rarely even vote comments . 
   so why are you replying to me like it is ? 
  i 'm only asking from you , maybe you happen to know why baltics are placed like that . 
  i clearly do n't . 
  oh , and my last question was more of a rhetorical one . 
  i fail to see why baltics would n't go for the deepest possible integration , especially if finland and sweden did . 
  our policy so far has always been as fast and as deep as possible . 
  why do you think we joined euro area even with the greek crisis ? 
   non indo-european so we 're all going to look like finns ? 
  oh my god , we have to stop this !, 
  should have taken it also in summer . 
  the angle is n't the same either . 
  arrghh , it bothers me . 
  ireland is definitely a success story . 
  however , you have a few qualities other european countries just ca n't have . 
  firstly , almost all of your people speak english natively and it 's the administrative language . 
  that makes it very attractive for global ( especially american ) companies and not only , also for educated professionals and specialists . 
  secondly , your considerably lower taxes , which you can afford , as for example , you have relatively young population , so you do n't need to spend much on pensions . 
  please read it again and then process it . 
  i said that we 're not going to compare which one is ( might have been ) worse , not that `` nazis were n't that bad '' . 
  they were * that bad * , they were extremely bad . 
  they brought war here , killed jews and other people , destroyed many of our infrastructure , buildings etc. 
  it 's just in what regards were the soviets better from that ? 
  i know , but afaik , that 's because there 's a limit on how much of your gdp can you gain eu funds , in order to not make the economy too dependent , and that 's what 's blocking ro&bg , as well as the lower absorption rate . 
  what ? 
  just take a look at all kind of indicators , gdp per capita , hdi etc. 
  where do you get the impression we would be on western european level ? 
  it 's pretty tough ride from former soviet union , you know . 
  i 'm honestly surprised estonia receives less per capita than slovenia , considering they 're significantly wealthier . 
   i you think that living in a country where certain ethnicities are systematically exterminated is not that bad as long as it 's not your ethnicity , then i do n't really have much to discuss with you . 
  have i said anything like that ? 
  i 'm not saying `` nazis were n't that bad '' , i 'm saying soviets were n't much better either . 
  you like to twist words so much that you imply i would prefer nazis , which is absolutely not true . 
  what i really said was that i despise * both * . 
   i mean the facts are well known , and they were known since the first weeks of occupation . 
  you know , i 've read that nazis planned to colonize estonia with some 200 ' 000 germans . 
  soviet union did that with nearly 400 ' 000 russians . 
  so really , what should we be happy about here ? 
   you were all fine and dandy watching and helping nazis slaughter jews and gypsies in baltics so generalization is absolutely fine for you as long as you need to portray an entire nation as nazis , just like in russian media ? 
  this is such a disgusting behaviour . 
  you ignore that soviets invaded baltics first and carried out heavy repressions , and secondly , it was all during war under nazi occupation . 
  now i 'm the last person who 'd want to justify collaborators , but it would be at least fair to bring out the context . 
  i 've also never got an answer that if baltic people were so nazi and evil , why did n't they kill their jews in 1930s , when they actually controlled their own countries ? 
  estonia even gave them cultural autonomy . 
   just those pesky russians snuck back in and spoiled all the fun ... is this one of those times history starts from 1941 , when the blooming pribaltika region of soviet motherland was invaded by evil nazis and where soviets heroically liberated these lands then ? 
  and now , those brainwashed locals do n't even show any respect for that ... 
   oh , i am sure they are much better with another incredibly corrupt regime , this time nationalist ( because it 's great in a multi-national country ) and pro-western , now with -20 % gdp and few regions less . 
  :') however , yeah , supporting violent revolution and toppling of the legitimate government by bunch of nationalist thugs is not ok and has nothing to do with promotion of democracy or human rights . 
  these `` ordinary people '' had to just wait 1 year to the next elections and vote for whatever candidate they wanted . 
  democracy is not mob rule . 
  you do realize that western support did n't cause any of these events ? 
  arguably russian actions did . 
  it 's ridiculous you try to lay the blame on the west . 
  why do you think your neighbours turn to west ? 
  your own behaviour is a fine example .

  well at least they can advertise themselves as a `` hidden gem '' and be different from those all-been-there-done-that france , spain and uk . 
  why do n't we try ? 
  i mean , estonia is surely doing much better on its own , would n't you say ? 
  estonia used to have very expensive tickets - in 2005 , a cinema ticket cost over 7 $ , and with wages back then , just ouch . 
  competition has brought prices down since then and cinema visiting has grown 8 years consecutively , with cinema visits more than doubling . 
  so yeah , competition is a very necessary thing in capitalism . 
  the first imax cinema in baltics will open in december in tallinn . 
  * 95 % ( 140 % max in russia , do n't you remember ?! ), 
  maybe some new countries , where other cultures besides russian could also thrive ? 
  because clearly , it is not working right now . 
  it 'd be nice to tell the reasons for such opinion as well or else it 's a quite meaningless statement . 
  i am quite neutral ( slightly leaning towards scotland staying ) about the subject myself as i think uk is a pretty nice and functioning country , it 's a great ally and its economy has just rebounded . 
  the shock of losing scotland could potentially harm the country and rest of europe too . 
  would scotland benefit from independence ? 
  we do n't know . 
  neither do scots , actually . 
  but do they * need * independence ? 
  i would n't say that . 
  they 're not opressed , they 're doing economically fine and their culture is already well-known worldwide . 
  would a smaller and more homogenous country function better ? 
  maybe . 
  do scots want it ? 
  no and yes , well , at least polls say these respectively . 
  no , what is bollocks is that while all the russian finno-ugric minorities soon face extinction , for russia , the issue of russian immigrants not having special rights in baltics seem much more serious . 
  it just shows that it 's not a `` multinational country '' they portray themselves to be , but actually very chauvinistic and heavily russian-oriented . 
  despite the fact that most of russia 's current territory is ethnic homelands of other nations , they act like it is russians ' . 
  neither in estonia . 
  what the hell , euronews ? 
  all right , for example , one of the largest finno-ugric groups , udmurts , are now a clear minority in their `` republic '' ( udmurtia ) - when in 1920s , they formed over half of the state 's people , now their share has dropped below 30 % . 
  russians make up over 60 % of the `` republic '' . 
  [ source ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/udmurtia#demographics ) [ mari el ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mari_el#ethnic_groups ) , another similar `` republic '' , has had less dramatic changes , but nevertheless , russians have become a majority , whereas the ethnic maris have become a minority . 
  in mordovia , mordvins are already the minority . 
  in [ komi republic ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/komi_republic#ethnic_groups ) , changes have been the most dramatic . 
  when in 1920s , komis made up over 90 % of the `` republic '' , then today , it is less than 25 % . 
  russians ' share rose from 6.6 % to 65.1 % . 
  and that 's about it . 
  other finno-ugric nations are smaller than 100 000 people ( so i 'm not going to meniton them ) , and those above 100 000 people ( exluding hungarians , finns and estonians - as they have their own countries ) have all become minorities in their ethnic homelands . 
  do you think such country has any rights to say anything about minorities , especially to other finno-ugric nations ? 
  i do not . 
  you know what 's funny ? 
  that russia 's `` support '' towards its ` compatriots ' in neighbouring countries is always creating tension , supporting pro-kreml media and making fake stories about discrimination . 
  never have they helped them in the job market , learning the local languages to integrate better or improve estonian-russian relations as russian would benefit the most ( mostly russians live near the border areas , so they also are hurt the most in ` counter-sanctions ' for example ) . 
  in short , nothing that would * actually * improve their lives . 
  the worst thing is that a lot of russians seem to support putin to the end , they 've been under russian influence ( media , soviet immigrants ) so long that they might live in estonia for all their lives and yet never feel to be part of the country . 
  it 's always `` great motherland rossiya '' for them . 
  fortunately , things seem to be changing among the youth . 
   why is this news ? 
  they 're doing it all the time . 
  what about rights of all those small nations that russia is occupying / has annexed ? 
  just russian hypocrisy and cynicism . 
  they always `` forget '' that russians in baltics are actually immigrants that soviet union ( aka russia 's predecessor ) illegally placed here , whereas all those * ethnic * minorities , including all the finno-ugric nations of russia are disappearing or being russificated very fast . 
  seems like some countries just think that some nations are better than others ( anti-fascist russia , anyone ?!, 
  actually , estonia produces a lot of dairy products , more than it consumes ( even though we consume them a lot ) . 
  the thing is that firstly , russia had already imposed several restrictions before and secondly , many estonian farms sell milk to lithuania , as they have much bigger processing capabilities , which then sells them to russia . 
  i 'm sure this inflates lithuania 's numbers too . 
   you are ex-ussr !, 
  well , should we then put egypt and bulgaria in one group as they were in ottoman empire once ? 
  i mean , of course , we can compare the countries to see how they 've fared . 
  but i 'm talking about using the cold war borders in 21st century to divide europe . 
   and no , i do n't think you share more in common with tajikistan , but these divisions are purely for statistical purposes and will have exactly no impact on your daily life . 
  if only that were true . 
  i even had a computer once with a sticker marked on that said it was for `` developing countries '' . 
  you know , where estonia is on par with mozambique . 
  oh , and statistics should be comparable , would n't you say ? 
  i think baltics and poland , for example , are much more comparable than ex-ussr . 
  but this is about northern and not nordic . 
  really , not putting us to nordic is something we 're used of , but lumping together with ex-ussr is just dumb . 
  unless you think estonia and tajikistan share more in common than estonia and finland . 
  you 're clearly over-reacting . 
  euro changeover was relatively painless in estonia and we joined in 2011 , when the debt crisis began , which was seen as a very bad time then . 
  also , estonian kroon was seen as a symbol of independence ( as well as continuity of the country ) . 
  now , estonians support the euro more than any other country in eu . 
  now , czech republic , which is already almost surrounded by euro area and which economy depends a lot on western european demand , not to mention tourism , would be one of the greatest benefiters of all . 
  such different attitudes towards euro between slovakia and czech republic seem rather weird to me . 
  especially considering that slovakia 's economy has been doing better . 
  i think those are mostly ( extreme ) nationalists , who think western world is ` too tolerant ' and putin is the ` right man ' . 
  fortunately , i have never met such people myself , but i guess ekre voters would think like that . 
  he 's definitely not random . 
  russia has even mentioned him before as `` dangerous '' . 
  he has supposedly a network of russians with whom he cooperates when dealing with cross-border cases . 
  russia would never take a random person . 
  which actually makes it even worse that he was abducted . 
  he served interests of estonia . 
  okay , you win this . 
  but the point stands that this has nothing to do with the west . 
  actually , tallinn might have had it even worse . 
  unlike moscow , tallinn had also a demographic shock - over 40 % of its residents were now russians ( up from just ~ 5 % in 1930s ) , result of massive immigration from russia . 
  lots of them suddenly discovered themselves in a nation state , unable to speak the only official language of the country . 
  just guess what happens to such people in such times . 
  i do n't agree with you at all . 
  where the hell does this `` russia got humiliated '' come from ? 
  70 years of communism collapsed !, 
  the whole economy collapsed , russians ' living standards collapsed . 
  it was n't somebody outside , it was themselves rushing to market economy , not west `` humiliating '' anyone . 
  it was bad , but they only got themselves to blame . 
  \u015aome people seem to forget that russia was n't the only one having bad times in 1990s . 
  baltics , for example , were very criminal , poor and corrupted countries ( even compared to poland and hungary , for example ) . 
  it was only the reforms we made ourselves that got us to the eu and how we 've managed to catch up with many countries by now . 
  yet , we 're not blaming anybody else , not to mention constantly attacking our neighbours . 
  russia trying to be the `` pole between east and west '' is nothing but inferiority comples .

  especially because they are russians . 
  but our problems are different from yours . 
   edit : also , i 'd appreciate a source for the 600 000 + muslim statistic . 
  the absolute highest number i could find was 400 000 , but most of them predicted around 100 000 - 120 000 . 
  i read it from dispatch international once ( 2015 i think ) . 
  they got the number by counting the names with islamic-origin . 
  their people are poor and infrastructure is in shambles , but they still got money for military and massive drills . 
  the demographics and the amount of the immigrants in sweden are different than in america , so you ca n't say that you are turning into america . 
  you are turning into something different . 
  right now sweden has 10 million people , 600.000 + of them are muslims . 
  ~ 20 % of the population of sweden has foreign background . 
  immigrants who are going to live their whole lives on welfare will cost sweden 1.5 million euros . 
  i genuinely do n't see sweden is coming back from this . 
  soon you will be broke and flung into chaos . 
  time to celebrate !, 
  of course the majority does n't embrace it , it 's insanity . 
  it still does n't undo the principle . 
  usa is the land of immigrants for immigrants . 
  statue liberty and the motto of ` freedom ' symbolise that .

  when we think of democracy we think of europe and north-america . 
  but europe , even pre-democracy era , was always doing better than the rest of the world . 
  democracy is nice but weak because parties always want to be in power . 
  they promise people what they want , but not always what is best for them and their country . 
  governing in democratic regime is slow , in dictatorship it is fast . 
  everything is done by the orders and wishes of the dictator . 
  just imagine if a dictator actually did what is best for the country and its people . 
  right now we have dictators who look after themselves and their cronies first , but in history there have been truly great dictators/monarchs who have done great things for their countries .

  at which point does the `` encircling '' begin ?

  the mother tounge of ukrainians fighting each other in eastern-ukraine is mainly russian . 
  and the civilians of donetsk are mainly old people . 
  the people fighting against ukraine are russian soldiers and some eastern-ukrainian petty criminals and thugs . 
  there are so many proofs of russians fighting in ukraine already , for example russian troops are posting about it on social media . 
  and as if ukraine could afford foreign or domestic mercenaries . 
  this is a law terminology . 
  domestic legal persons and domestic natural persons are respectively companies located in your country that are treated as persons and real people who are also citizens . 
  domestic legal persons are corporations that are treated as if they are persons . 
  so it is pretty stupid for you to hint that this has something to do with the constitution . 
  it has nothing to do with constitution and whatever social security the constitution grants , it grants for the citizens . 
  constitution is the core foundation and the purpose of the country . 
  there are seperate acts and laws for benefits . 
  usually the amount of money and the system on how the benefits are distributed change quite often , every new goverment has their own idea of benefits and welfare . 
  if these things were included in the constitution , then it would be especially troublesome to change it all the times . 
  i do n't think that you understand what a consititution consists of . 
  it would be a lot easier to cut all aid and benefits to those people and then offer them 1.200 to return home .

  according to one turkish guy i met their language is pronounced very much how it 's written , similarly to estonian/finnish , not like english where the same letter can often have 4 different pronunciations . 
  on the year 1848 the finnish poet johan runeberg wrote a poem in swedish named \u201e our land '' . 
  on the same year fredrik pacius , a german living in finland , wrote melody to it . 
  since the original lyrics did n't point to finland specifically the song was also popular in sweden , denmark , norway ( reason it is also remarkably similar to both sweden 's and norway 's anthems :d ) and of course estonia , where it made its way through visitor choirs . 
  back then nobody could predict it would become the song national movements cling on to , it is said that pacius composed the tune in a mere fifteen minutes and there are rumors he based the melody on an old german drinking tune ... johann voldemar jannsen wrote the estonian lyrics `` my fatherland , my happiness and joy '' in 1869 and it was first sang in this form on the first national song festival in tartu on the same year , which resulted in it becoming an instant national symbol . 
  the current finnish text is usually attributed to the 1889 translation of ensign st\u00e5l by paavo cajander , but in fact originates from the 1867 translation by julius krohn . 
  fast forward 50 years , the song had simultaneously become an important part of the national movements both for the finns and estonians . 
  both nations felt strong brotherhood ties and using the same song to inspire people actually gave strength to go against the russian empire in 1917-1918 . 
  one has to remember that before the ussr , finns and estonians were in a very similar position in the world . 
  as far as i know it was never a `` they copied our anthem '' - thing because the melody was already popular by the time it became a national symbol during the awakening period , it is true that finns created it first , but it also true that estonians can be said to have used it longer as specifically a national symbol , however i 'm glad to say it has never really been an issue . 
  it 's simply one of those things that somehow ended up being like that , universe is a funny thing . 
  finns have n't made it their official anthem but it 's been traditionally used as such , there have been talks to change the anthem to jean sibelius ' `` finlandia '' , but i do n't know if that 's still a plan , maybe a finn could chip in about the current situation ... 
  cool thing is that we can both hear our anthems twice on the olympics and other events . 
  wiki puts it like this :  skype was first released in 2003 written by estonian developers monish mohan , priit kasesalu , and jaan tallinn , danish janus friis , and swedish niklas zennstr\u00f6m . 
  and also because it was the last country in europe to be christianized so we 've had less time to forget our old pagan traditions . 
  might be because they are n't united as one , estonian russians are quite divided politically , it 's quite a surprising gradient really , those who are more integrated ( and speak estonian ) have different priorities and views to those less integrated , and those living in the capital have different opinions to those living in the less wealthy north-eastern corner of the country ( area that has the highest saturation of russian population ) . 
  on soviet times some russians moved here because of the relatively high standard of living ( compared to some other soviet block countries ) so they made a choice by themselves and in general tended to be more educated and well off , but many others were incentivized/organized/almost forced to move here by the government and hold different views about estonia . 
  also many young russians see estonia just as a gateway to europe and plan on moving elsewhere at some point , so perhaps the new generation does n't bother participating in our politics if they do n't plan to stay here anyway . 
  yes , finnish , swedish , icelandic , estonian , rotuman , german , turkish , azerbaijani , turkmen , tatar and hungarian alphabets use the letter \u00d6 instead of \u00d8 . 
  maybe we should just combine the two letters into \u00d8\u0308 .

  ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8b/fenno-ugrian_people.png ) there are social programs in place both in estonia and finland which try to do their best to help them out , but the situation is pretty complicated . 
  every estonian is often reminded of how precious and fragile is our independence , how easily it could 've not came to be . 
  we call it eesti . 
  personally i prefer estland to estonia and think it should also be called such in english , because it holds a lot more history and we 've been called estland for * way * longer than we 've been called estonia . 
  but i 'm probably a very small odd minority that holds such beliefs and i doubt most people care , honestly we 're just glad we 're called anything at all ... as opposed to being another wiped out nation like many of our finno-ugric relatives . 
   those three countries seem the same to me the term `` baltic states '' was artificially created in the 1920s and originally included finland when all 4 become independent from russian empire . 
  the term `` baltic republics '' became the informal name for latvia , lithuania and estonia when the 3 were incorporated into the soviet union . 
  culturally all 3 are actually remarkably different , estonia perhaps more so than other two . 
  main points : * linguistic . 
  latvian and lithuanian belong to the same group of baltic languages within the indo-european family ( like almost all of europe ) . 
  estonian is not even indo-european , but fenno-ugric . 
  as a result , estonians have very close ties with finland . 
  culturally estonia and finland are part of the same tribes family and are thought to come from the east , while latvia and lithuania are balts and are thought to come from the south . 
  * religious . 
  estonians are currently one of the least religious people in europe ( 86 % atheists ) , lithuanians are devout catholics , and latvians are in between . 
  historically , estonians are lutherans , lithuanians -- catholics and latvians are a mixture of the two . 
  * currency . 
  estonia adopted the euro in january 2011 whilst latvia and lithuania do not have a specified date , but lithuania hopes to do the same in the following years and latvia in 2014 . 
  estonia had the lowest government debt to gdp in the european union in 2012 ( 10.1 % ) , while latvia and lithuania are both at 40.70 % . 
  estonia also had the lowest government deficit in percentage of gdp , measuring 0.3 percent of gdp and putting the country second in the eu only to germany , which had a government surplus of 0.2 percent . 
  estonia was actually part of the [ imf-led bail out of latvia with 7 billion eur . 
  ] ( http://www.economist.com/node/12815635?story_id=12815635 ) * old ties . 
  lithuania was an equal partner in the lithuanian-polish kingdom , while both estonia and latvia were either provinces or possessions of sweden , denmark and later russia . 
  * lithuania positions itself towards central europe and shares a lot of history with poland , estonia sees itself more as nordic and feels brotherhood with finland . 
  it probably sounds very estonian-centric and geared towards showing estonia in a good light , sorry about that , these were simply the only main facts i knew which differentiates the 3 countries ...

  ... hm , this post turned into more about estonia than sweden did n't it ... : /, 
  it 's a difficult subject , estonians see it as a statue to the soldiers who conquered , occupied and literally raped us , the russians see it as an statue to the unknown ones who bravely gave their lives in the ww2 . 
  so it was relocated unharmed to a war cemetery where it is in a more peaceful environment . 
  in 2007 tallinn ( estonia ) had a small riot by russian youth , police let them do their thing without interfering much mainly so the rioters would show their true face , sure enough at one point the vandalizing turned into looting and they made themselves look ridiculous as photos of young russian men stealing women 's hygiene products appeared in media and online .

  some elements of the gop are actually gleefully admitting to using it for manipulation of elections . 
  the introduction of id cards in a country as big as the us would be a major logistical undertaking and it would have a huge impact if made compulsory for voting , so care would have to be taken to make the transition slowly and ensure that poorer citizens would have it made easily available to them .

  no matter which way they were going to draw the border , bad shit was guaranteed to happen . 
  what other options did the british have ? 
  there were no good options . 
  the best case scenario would have been if the british were n't there to begin and questions of land and faith were left to the locals to decide . 
  the fact that the british were there and had to make that choice is precisely the problem . 
  you really made this point more difficult than it should have been . 
  a very interesting essay . 
  thanks for posting it . 
  is she going to tour the battlegrounds in donbass as well ? 
  the crash site of the mh17 perhaps ? 
  guessing dead ukrainians and other europeans do n't concern her . 
  uh , well ... 
  i 'm not . 
  you 're embarrassing yourself with these strawmen . 
  estonia does * fine * with a liberal tax policy that generally favors corporations and higher earners . 
  it 's not doing great by any means , because these policies bring significant downsides as well as benefits . 
  the profits that foreign companies make in estonia generally goes back out again . 
  i have myself have lost a job because the tech company we were hired out to chose to move their operations to greece ( a country that actually has a higher corporate tax rate ) despite lower than average local wages and no significant tax burdens here . 
  presumably they could get a better deal in a country with +20 % unemployment - which is a great example of the race to the bottom that others in this thread have mentioned . 
  companies will always prefer underpaying labor if they can . 
  by the way , here 's a fun fact for you . 
  the whole e-society thing that estonia has going on ? 
  the reputation as a country with a great it sector ? 
  that 's all because the * government * invested in coputer science education in the early years of independence . 
  i 'd rather have 28 days of government-mandated holidays per year than a european silicon valley . 
   the rich would become richer ... you got that part of your post right . 
  the richer people get , the more of their money they hoard and stow away . 
  the idea that they everything is invested and eventually trickles down is as fantastical as communism . 
   if the governments focused on lowering taxes for everyone , the result would be much better . 
  except for people who benefit from public works and services that these taxes fund . 
  but i 'm sure there are n't many people like that . 
  here 's an example of a foreign power helping germany : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kama_tank_school, 
   as a lithuanian , you should understand that it was because of soviet union that you were allowed to have your country 's independence ( and ukraine hers ) . 
  lithuania got its independence in 1991 , when the soviet union collapsed . 
  14 people were killed and hundreds injured before the soviets left . 
  hey , soviet russia was orwell 's main inspiration for that concept . 
  sirenara ? 
  so do you think , for instance , that pakistani muslims , for all their faults , feel entitled to a piece of europe because of the religious wars of the ottomans ? 
  or how about iranians , long-time geopolitical and sectarian enemies of the ottomans ? 
  these incredibly broad generalizations do not compute . 
  slavery in the united states is relevant today because its impact is still felt today . 
  what impact does barbary piracy have today ? 
  are there families in southern europe still holding grudges because of ancestors kidnapped two centuries ago ? 
  are there still descendants of white slaves in northern africa , distinguishable from those of white colonists ? 
  this is a false equivalence . 
  you ought to be comparing russian imperialism to ottoman imperialism , not muslims as a whole . 
  i would understand and respect people from the balkans reacting to nationalist posturing from turkey with the same fear and suspicion the baltic countries have for russia , especially if territorial claims are invoked , but that 's because turkey is the successor state of the ottoman empire . 
  various other muslims from around the world , even from former ottoman territories , simply do not share that cultural legacy even though they share the religion .

  if they arrive at the wrong place they 'll kill the passengers ? 
  if his intentions are anything other than crashing the plane , he does n't need access to the cockpit . 
  he can force the pilot to land somewhere else or w/e without it . 
   but i honestly think that a fucked up hijacker could persuade a pilot to open the door anyway how ? 
  if you let him in the cockpit he 's gon na crash the plane , so what could he threaten that would be worse than that ? 
  yeah , i do n't know what happened . 
  we used to have one of the highest speeds , but as they finished the last grid , there has n't been much progress . 
  the internet in my house which i got ~ 10 years ago 15mbps down was pretty good at the time , but since then there has been no possibility for upgrade . 
  they started a project called `` estwin '' in 2009 that was about bringing fiber atleast 1,5 km of 98 % of houses and businesses in estonia , but that delayed because of the economic crisis , although it 's still ongoing it 's facing some problems with isp 's saying that the goverment provided fiber ports are too expensive , i hope this gets resolved . 
  although lately , faster speeds have begun to spread again and i think we will be in the top 10 again in a few years . 
  russia , not even once . 
  why did it not pass ? 
  well , his job is very different from the one us president has , estonian president is more of a representative and our `` hype '' guy with not much actual power . 
  and he is representing and hyping us well !, 
  it 's legal in practice , at least where i live , especially if you do n't redistribute . 
  there are sites like `` watchseries '' , `` solarmovie '' or `` icefilms '' where you do n't even have to torrent , just press play and it streams . 
  movies and tv shows are a simple google search away . . 
  well you are n't in the eu , so this would n't really even currently apply to you and if you were/will be , then serbia is n't exactly a market services like netflix rush to , so you either get nothing or content that might be a bit limited . 
  yeah , he was born here , but he was n't really an estonian , `` estonia '' did n't exist yet , he was only 1/4th estonian , his father was half-estonian . 
  with the rather young population of / r/europe and the fact he 's been dead for a while i thought maybe that many people did n't know about him , but he 's definitely without question one of the best estonians who ever lived . 
  he 's almost as this mythological figure here , who people tell stories about , which may or may not be exaggerated , but alas , now that i think about it , i should 've added him out of principle already !, 
  he 's a pretty chill guy , i think he does his job well . 
  he 's no match to `` lennart meri '' , but probably no one ever will . 
  your wife is famous from pornhub ? 
  arvo p\u00e4rt is one of the most famous composers alive , baruto is a very successful sumo wrestler , so he 's probably really only known in japan . 
  carmen kass is a quite famous model . 
  kerli k\u00f5iv `` kerli '' is a somewhat famous singer currently living in us and toomas hendrik ilves is the current president of estonia , known for using twitter a lot , knowing how to program etc. 
  that 's why i added the question marks , but any cultured person should know about arvo p\u00e4rt , though . 
  do presidents count ? 
  toomas hendrik ilves is also pretty known . 
   we are definitely the country that is doing the best out of all post-communistic ones you are joking , right ? 
  i heard , and i could be entirely wrong here , that the actual size of the foreign reserve is unknown to the public , might they have actually spent much more ? 
  can someone explain to me , what is there to gain by protesting against austerity ? 
  the government magically makes more money and jobs appear ? 
  what do these people actually want to be done ? 
  i ca n't see how defaulting could make anything better . 
  such a headline just makes it seem like it 's in the same ballpark as protesting against heavy rain or the length of the day being too short . 
  if you speculate , then say so , not claim  if for example spain had its own central bank they could have handled financial crisis better . 
  like it 's a sure deal . 
  we 're talking 1v1 , if nazi germany had to waste time and resources invading greece it is n't 1v1 anymore . 
   what i meant was that if for example spain had its own central bank they could have handled financial crisis better . 
  this is pure speculation that holds no value . 
  but it does n't say anything of the sort you 're saying . 
   estonia is second in europe after spain in terms of number of species seen during migration . 
  can you give me a source for that claim ? 
  i did n't find it on that webpage when looking around for a short while . 
  if it is there , could it be that they 're comparing estonia and mainland spain ? 
  and maybe it 's true for that , but not true if you consider their overseas territories . 
  also that 's a really benign thing to complain about and i 'm more than sure that it 's either a mistake or they use a difference source that claims otherwise , not intentional lying . 
   tsk tsk tsk , no need to be rude . 
  i never said they should n't like estonia , i said they should n't treat estonia like it 's second coming of jesus or something . 
  i 'm not being rude , you are . 
  nobody is treating estonia like that , people just like estonia and i do n't see why you should immediately get an inferiority complex over that . 
  what white lies ? 
  why are you so butthurt over a lot of latvians and lithuanians liking estonia ? 
  they 're still no match of russia 's . 
  so it does n't really matter . 
  this is true , but overall our self governance would still decrease and i think people here just are n't ready for that . 
  we definitely want to get there , but we 've had to jumpstart our economy . 
  so we do n't want to go crazy with the taxes yet , need to make companies want to invest here , but i think the point where we 'll be comfortable enough is n't too far off . 
  i think an union would be awesome , i think it 's too early for a federation/confederation for estonia , we have been independent for too short , we would like to enjoy this new found freedom for a while . 
  also the same issue with population sizes , i think it 's hard to find a balanced way , either we get steamrolled by the bigger members or we get more representation for a smaller population . 
  hell no , those articles , you just made me remember middle school . 
  never again . 
  damn , 28,5 million people on 74 926 km ^ 2 , estonia is 1,3 million people on 45 227 km ^ 2 , do n't you guys run out of room there ? 
  i do n't believe there is much room to argue . 
   they would be 40km away from the scene in a worst case scenario . 
  well , at least they 're always be a maximum of 40km away , some accidents in finland and estonia happen much further away from emergency services . 
  not to say it would be a good idea though , it would be too easy to drive a bomb in there and cause billions of damage and major loss of life . 
  it 's much harder to take a bomb on a train and even then the size would be restricted . 
  also trains are faster , more comfortable ( knowing estonia and finland there would be the best available internet the whole trip ) and less chance for human error . 
  that 's not 1v1 , if you give them 430 000 trucks , 13 000 combat vehicles etc. . . 
  well if both countries got zero outside help and only had to fight each other , there 's no chance russia would 've even put up a good fight . 
   the united states gave to the soviet union from october 1 , 1941 to may 31 , 1945 the following : 427,284 trucks , 13,303 combat vehicles , 35,170 motorcycles , 2,328 ordnance service vehicles , 2,670,371 tons of petroleum products ( gasoline and oil ) , 4,478,116 tons of foodstuffs ( canned meats , sugar , flour , salt , etc. 
  ) , 1,900 steam locomotives , 66 diesel locomotives , 9,920 flat cars , 1,000 dump cars , 120 tank cars , and 35 heavy machinery cars . 
  etc. . 
  i had a guy dead serious in / r/ukrainianconflict that the soviet union would 've won against nazi germany alone , 1 versus 1 . 
   europe 's inability to spend 2 % some of us actually do spend the 2 % !, 
  even before the ukraine thing . 
  i think the issue is that the populations are really different , so either you have countries that do n't get much representation at all , if it 's per capita or if every country sends one , small countries get too much of a say , which is again unfair if a population of one million gets the same amount of representation as a population of 60 million . 
  i believe there should be more cohesion , but nothing this drastic . 
  some of us are just settling in to having our own country and freedom to make our own decisions and would n't be so quick to give it up . 
  there are too many success stories to say that giving money does n't pay off , even if a fraction goes to waste , in addition to countries i 've named , there 's romania , czech republic , slovakia , slovenia , etc. 
  all you have is saying allegedly some money is being wasted in hungary , but hungary is doing much better than before joining the eu still , that means a bigger market for goods coming from germany , france , uk etc. 
  in the big picture is hard to deny it does n't have a positive effect . 
  well without the rail baltica , you still have a far easier time visiting places like germany , france etc since you have a lot more plane traffic . 
  estonians often fly or go by ferry to helsinki first or from riga to visit those places . 
  there just is n't enough people here to warrant enough destinations and cheaper flights . 
  but yeah , that 's gon na change a bit with the rail baltica . 
  i 'm pretty sure estonia would go for this , it 's more on finland to get behind this as well . 
  with eu funds i believe it 's possible , but finland would probably have to contribute more money than estonia , because you have more to contribute . 
  a deal in the ballpark of 70 % -30 % ( + eu money ) or something would probably be accepted here easily . 
  sadly , car tunnels also run the risk of someone blowing it up with tremendous consequences to human life . 
  there are observers and audits sent by the eu , if you misuse the money you have to pay it back , sure you do n't always get caught but it only takes one time to get prosecuted and end up in jail . 
  i think the problem is far smaller than you think it is . 
  most european countries are succeeding while africa is n't . 
  most of africa had maybe a hundred or few hundreds years of enslavement , estonia was basicly enslaved for close to 700 years . 
   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/serfdom your point does n't hold any water , it 's looking for an excuse where the is none to be found . 
  it 's easy to blame everyone else beside themselves . 
   bulgaria in 2012 once again had the negative distinction of leading the global suffering list , with 39 % of bulgarians rating their lives poorly enough to be considered `` suffering .

  well there you have it . 
  i snorted on the ice-cream i was eating . 
  what you call `` ugly communist architecture '' is a ( not necessarily extra ugly ) ussr version of the `` large cheap residential building '' archetype present in pretty much every part of the world , including ` murica . 
  moving towards welfare . 
  danes founded the capital . 
  i mean it 's literally called danish city , what else do you need . 
  also , danish territories in estonia 1219-1343/1573 -1645 . 
  `` golden age '' under swedish rule , 1558-1710 . 
  also , coastal swedes have lived here for a long-ass time . 
  they speak swedish , a north germanic language . 
  russian era 1721-1917 , soviet era 1940-1991 . 
  and throughout most of all these occupations ( especially the one by russian empire ) the real rulers of estonia were the local german nobility . 
  well it 's a unique aesthetic if anything . 
  i 'm a man and i require all those toys . 
  [ x ] flip off russia [ x ] become nordic [ ] europe 's top 5 richest [ ] ansip ascends to godhood,

  finland or germany ( in that order or preference ) . 
  cultural proximity + easy to learn the language . 
  add to that the baltic special arrangement in the livonian region which allowed it to be relatively left alone by russian central authorities from the great nordic war all the way to the start of russification around 1880s ( iirc ) . 
  `` friendly '' , he says .

  as far as i know no-one gives two shits about you being roma as long as you do n't come off as the stereotypical ( and hated ) roma , i.e.

  how about no misleading titles , eh . 
  that 's exactly the thing . 
  opening up borders and being tolerant should n't be related in the public eye . 
  my country 's immigration policy is strict as hell and the general public is relatively xenophobic , and there should n't be a connection . 
  we could become more open in our minds without becoming more open in terms of borders . 
  i had deja-vu moments from cod campaign videos . 
  a * sensible comment * ? 
  mom , get the camera . 
  i retract that . 
  not sure what i meant myself . 
   and i have n't met any russian , who is n't aware how dire the situation right now is . 
  that 's a * really * poor argument . 
  edited first post for clarity . 
  not trying to fearmonger over here , sorry if it came out that way . 
  1 . who you calling friends . 
  putin steals from his people . 
  if he were safeguarding the interests of his people , he 'd stop waging wars with his neighbours and turning his country into an international pariah , subsequently destroying all foreign investment . 
  nobody wants to `` mess '' with russia because unlike you , the leaders of the world possess a thing called `` brains '' which tell them a nuclear war is a not a viable solution to international problems . 
  russia 's economy is collapsing and even belarus is kinda iffy about dealing with them . 
  they 're weaker than ever . 
  europe is democratic , richer than russia and more relevant than russia . 
  we 're divided because we like our democracy . 
  the general public is pretty stupid , so i would n't quote a high approval rating ( especially in a country that reeks of state-run propaganda ) as measure of good leadership . 
  you 're naive to think the americans and the cia are the only manipulative force out there . 
  get your head out of russian propaganda and step into the real world where we get our news from multiple differently-minded sources . 
  people who are worried about a military coup that 'll bring crazy trigger-happy fascists with a massive fucking nuclear arsenal on the throne of the biggest country in the world ? 
  yeah . 
  those people care . 
  edit : i 'm in no way saying that he has in fact been dethroned by crazy trigger-happy fascists . 
  i 'm just saying that the sheer possibility of it should keep everyone at least slightly concerned . 
  no fear-mongering was involved in the making of this post , 
  which is why he said de facto , not de jure . 
  't was a joke . 
  if you want the actual head of government , look up rain rosimannus . 
  not to take a political stance here or anything , but the article conveniently does n't seem to mention that these were european colonies/protectorates at the time , rather than independent countries . 
  they do . 
  they 're provided with the means to learn the language and subsequently become a citizen , and there 's the initiative of life getting substantially easier once you 've achieved even just the first . 
  it 's difficult to integrate though when you 're provided with a large russian-majority area along with russian schools and russian-language media ( the state runs both a tv and radio station in russian ) . 
  plus , having a `` grey passport '' like a lot of the unintegrated russians do , is better than having an eu or russian passport . 
  they effectively have free access to both with no major repercussions . 
  it 's not in the state 's interest to keep them unintegrated and comments about how segregationist or racist or fascist we are towards the local russians hit pretty heavily when you 're making a big god damn effort to manage the one-nation-state which just happens to be bilingual simply because some assholes decided to begin colonizing our territory with the aim of wiping us out 70 years ago . 
  you can kinda understand the bitter `` they do n't belong here/they do n't deserve to be here '' sentiment . 
  at this point continuing to argue seriously would be bad manners on my part since i ca n't be arsed to get actual statistics after 2am , but as far as stats-from-my-head go ... 
  the russian minority has a lower average income , has smaller social mobility , is largely restricted to two major russian areas ( the lasnam\u00e4e district in tallinn and the east-viru county ) , has higher crime rates , higher drug use , lower life expectancy . 
  there is noticeable prejudice and ethnicity-based racism between ethnic estonians and russians , as well as persisting historical grievances , closed-off clinging to the soviet memory on the russian part , a worrisome lack of drive to integrate into the estonian state and society etc. 
  it 's incredibly easy to recognize the unintegrated russians and there 's rather heavy prejudice against them . 
  without a non-white minority for relative scale , the russian minority more or less has the functions of a different-skin-colour minority . 
  whether or not we have a specifically * non-white * minority is irrelevant though . 
  we have a vast minority group of 25 % + , a majority of whom ( if i remember the numbers correctly ) do n't speak estonian and a substantial amount of them are n't estonian citizens and have no intention to become one . 
  69 % estonian . 
  i similarly could n't be arsed to start writing an essay to refute , it 's 3am . 
  yes , but when making an argument it has to hold . 
  i agree that `` problem regions under a dictator are much more stable than any attempts at democracy '' is a flawed statement . 
  however , disproving it with your example similarly does n't * quite * work , because it leaves out many important factors , beginning with the unique socio-political structure of every single country ( which is also the reason that sweeping statements such as the one you 're refuting do n't work ) . 
  so i 'm not so much arguing against you as i 'm saying that your argumentation could use some work ( e.g. 
  dividing countries into dictatorships and non-dictatorships is n't capable of grasping the complexity of the authoritarian-to-democratic scale ) . 
  may have expressed my point a bit crudely , sorry for that . 
  this argument is completely useless . 
  whether a country is a de jure dictatorship or a de facto maybe-dictatorship ( which in itself are flawed and incomplete distinctions with no regard to the more specific political structure of the states in question ) is barely half a factor in their success as a state . 
  there are * so * many other things you have to take into account when deciding on a question as wide as `` is dictatorship good for a problematic region '' . 
  goodness me , even * our * highest peak is higher . 
  give this man a mountain . 
  i feel that 's more because both fn and the new ruling party of poland are perceived as far-righters ( do n't want to straight up call them far-right , have n't done any reading into polish politics ) and far-righters tend to have a bit of a lousy reputation . 
  possibly because of one certain big war . 
  whereas moderate right-wing parties gaining power raise no `` omg apocalypse '' reactions , as far as i can tell . 
   * i have kind have given up * yes , seems legit .

   or maybe , just maybe it has something to do with the whole business on shifting the blame on russians and russians alone ? 
  who else then ? 
  though , if an estonian does n't drink coffee at all ( like me ) , and sometimes drinks tea , then `` his vote '' would go to the tea party ... 
  why so ? 
   and also yeah erdogan is a dictator , so he would ally with russia according to your logic . 
  well , it 's not like all dictators are best friends , they are often worse enemies due to conflicting ideologies . 
  and i really thought turkey and russia have horrible relations because they are natural competitors . 
  it would just strike me as odd if a turkish dictator was able to sway its people to forget past grievances with russia to face europe together for ... whatever reason . 
  well , in history estonia has always been wealthier due to better climate for agriculture , more important trade routes etc. 
  even for quite a long time estonia 's population was ahead of finland 's until the major wars ravaged estonia . 
  however i should n't even mention that of course this bigger wealth did n't much reach estonians , as it was in the hands of the baltic germans . 
   an example of democratic countries allying with undemocratic ones . 
  one thing is cooperation as allies , another is actually having one as a permanent coalition member . 
   who backed south korea back when it was a backwater dictatorship ? 
  you ca n't really bring out this analogy - it was done in order to keep the communists out , which were a far bigger threat during cold war . 
   turkey is not a dictatorship and even if it was a good democracy , which it is n't , democracies do n't owe obligation to other democracies . 
  did n't say that either . 
  however a union of democratic countries should not tolerate it when one of its members becomes a dictatorship . -  as if turkey was the one pushing this deal while it was not . 
  if you are talking about the new migrant-visa free travel deal , then i have to agree with you , eu 's policies are quite chaotic and weak . 
   turkey already does more than it is obliged . 
  agreed , although not controlling your territorial waters on your part is an intentional weakness . 
   by virtue they are free to leave turkey if they want to . 
  no , turkey has agreements with neighboring countries to respect the borders and turkey must on its part protect them also from threats coming form within their country . 
  i agree that integrated foreigners ( including russians ) with citizenship can vote . 
  they were illegals , as they or all of their ancestors came to estonia illegally . 
   so , all eu nationals can vote in municipal elections , so where are these illegals that votes ? 
  are you now saying eu nationals are illegal too ? 
  or pr holders ? 
  please explain how an illegal person can register and vote in these elections ? 
  you seem to have misinterpreted my comments ... slavery as in the standard concept has never during modern history been a thing in estonia . 
  however , almost all ethnic estonians were serfs , which was similar in essence . 
   so here is the question , are all actions carried out by the gov during the ussr occupation of estonian illegal ? 
  basically , yes , exactly like with nazi germany in many countries . 
  it does n't mean all of the actions were reversed ( as if that was possible ) , but they remained in force as long as they were n't reversed . 
  as estonia granted automatic citizenship only to estonian citizens by birth , they remained illegal immigrants . 
  their residence was `` legalized '' when estonia adopted laws to govern the lives of these `` stateless persons '' . 
  very few estonians have been tried , as not many particularly estonian-orchestrated crimes happened after stalin and all the initial collaborators are long dead . 
  some have been tried for participating in the deportations though , but in essence , the soviet occupation is seen as a russian crime , for which estonians are n't in general to be blamed . 
  like , marriage licenses are legal still , because they have little to do with any regime change . 
  however often when people bought property , it is now considered illegal , because the property was initially forcefully taken from its original owners . 
  that 's why after independence many people got their property back and the people , who had moved there in those close to 50 years , had to leave . 
  my grandfather and his sister also got two houses back , which belonged to their father , but remained empty as their entire family was sent to siberia in 1941/1949 and when some of them returned in 1954-1955 , new people were living in these houses and at first , they were n't even allowed back to their birth town . 
  immigration was not legal , especially considering it was a russification colonization policy and a crime according to international law ( sending people to occupied territories ) . 
  however birth certificates have little to do with politics , so they are considered legal of course . 
   remember , if you consider one action of these actions illegal , this sets a case ( in law ) that all actions carried out during that time is illegal . 
  and no , that 's not how law works in continental europe , we do n't work on case law , but on adopted law . 
  if you had any legal background , you 'd know it already . 
  did i claim there was one ? 
  i said he is moving towards a dictatorship . 
   i am not ok with dictatorships . 
  ca n't believe i was bothering arguing here ... 
  you are ok with dictatorships ? 
  wtf ... 
  who said turkey is unwanted in nato ? 
  is that really what you read from me ? 
  what i claimed is that turkey as a dictatorship should n't be in nato . 
  if you think that erdogan turning your country into a dictatorship is normal , then the problem lies within you . 
   europeans are making it clear that they do n't want to negotiate with turkey in the first place , because you are not european , you are a muslim country , with unstable politics and now an apparent dictatorship . 
  what the hell do you expect from the eu ? 
   how is the situation with savisaar ? 
  i guess he represents you since he is estonian like you are . 
  yes , because we have one party in estonia ... 
   it 's not up to you to decide that . 
  thankfully . 
  never claimed it was and i would n't say i would definitely make the same decision . 
  however it is my well reasoned opinion that we should n't be aligned with dictatorships . 
  [ garlic bread made of black bread ] ( http://s3.amazonaws.com/foodspotting-ec2/reviews/5613272/thumb_600.jpg?1445060671 ), 
  `` oh no , how could she ? 
  she was a popular actress !, 
  i thought only politicians and businessmen were bad people ... '' or something like that . 
  ah , no biggie , we 'll get the russians to replace them . 
  russians have a tendency to replace peoples anyway . 
   i have this feeling  because we ** feel **, 
  well , i can get that germans are a larger group of historically ( relatively ) distinct peoples , however it seems that other regional groups are identifying more as germans than regionals , or at least on par . 
  and it 's not just about understanding your dialect . 
  even in small estonia , i can not much understand the southeastern dialects , yet they still consider themselves estonians . 
  since when can conflicting south american countries be called real democracies ? 
  and what about erdogan ? 
  him becoming a dictator more and more every day is exactly what i meant . 
  no i literally do n't want to align my country with a fucking dictatorship . 
  how is that relevant to what i said ? 
  perhaps you 'd want to enforce some censorship on me ? 
  you guys seem to get hurt a lot by words lately . 
  any examples from recent history ? 
   you do n't understand that nato does not care for values , or wheter if the country is a dictatorship or not . 
  well , considering all its members thus far have been democratic ... and you are right that one can be allies with a dictatorship as well , out of necessity - that 's exactly the same that should be done with turkey , however you do n't deserve nato if you are becoming an oppressive dictatorship . 
   betray how so ? 
  if you become a dictatorship , which you almost already are , then you do n't share the same values with us . 
  aligning yourself with an imperialist dictatorship after that would only prove we were right ... 
  democratic countries do n't generally align themselves against other democratic countries ... 
  that 's why it seems you are a sickly nation . 
  i understand that very well , but what came as a surprise for me is them being so eager to ally themselves with russia ... 
  already too long and biased , did n't read ... 
   we would ally with russia faster than you can blink . 
  but why ? 
  and is this the kind of ally we would want in nato , who is so eager to ally itself with russia ? 
  and it really seems you are living in a dictatorship ... 
  i did n't say that . 
  not being in nato does not mean one should be enemies and could n't cooperate in other ways . 
  no i do n't need to call you anything , i know very well how similar those varieties or `` languages '' are .

   stalin 's and hitler 's ideas were ideas of a minority of people . 
  it seems that you are using demagoguery . 
  it was you who used the phrase `` ideas of the people '' . 
  so now are you suggesting that the ideas of the minority are not ideas of the people ? 
   furthermore , stalin 's ideas were not even elected upon and neither were hitler 's later on . 
  neither are juncker 's . 
   as long as we have a democracy , the parties still represent the ideas of large groups of people and are therefore necessary . 
  the parties are only necessary for bargaining of decision power . 
  in all other cases the static parties are not necessary . 
  such a bargaining solution is something that almost surely will go against the will of the majority of the citizenry . 
  all those actas and sopas and pitas and business method patents - those are not the will of the citizenry and not for the greater good . 
  and passing such bills through the fishing committee is a bit fishy . 
   or rather , what do you suggest as an alternative ??? 
  the parties can stay as part of the house of establishment . 
  they are established parties , after all . 
   nope , got to give evidence , otherwise it 's just a silly conspiracy theory . 
  ttip is just one such example . 
   it was a morally right decision even though the majority was against that . 
  so now you are playing god or a representative of god . 
   it is a question of minority rights and equal treatment . 
  minority can only have the rights granted by the majority . 
  the law treats the majority and the minority as the same : both would have to gain majority in order to pass legislation . 
  all the rest is up to the decisions of the majority . 
  i have faith in the majority , you have faith in the establishment . 
   plus , that is a clear direction where the western world is heading and how the younger generation thinks . 
  you mean the rising isis ? 
  you are a fool to believe in linear evolution and everlasting economic growth and everlasting population growth . 
   we should n't wait for the old goons to die to bring in normal legislation , we should be actively progressive in our legislation . 
  the ` we ' at it again !, 
  you mean the establishment . 
  and thus you as part of the establishment , or at least a faithful follower . 
   of what goods and service purchases ? 
  it was a question of about 50,000 immigrants . 
  that is for you to find out . 
  the capability to service those 50000 does not appear overnight . 
  apparently it takes 2-3 years at the very least . 
   yes , as a jurist , i have seen many of my clients , who are from the lowest levels of life . 
  they are actually regular people , but i would be afraid of our future if the future was directly in their hands . 
  you mean you fear that they came for the wrong specialist for consultations ? 
  regardless , meritocracy is not democracy . 
  and plutocracy is not democracy . 
  so do n't cover with false feathers . 
  false feathers means deception . 
   the establishment is relatively static within the 4 years timeframe , while the will of the citizenry is not . 
  the establishment might be static , but the the will of the establishment is not static and it should not be static . 
  but as i understand in your opinion the will of the establishment should be static for 4 years and should not follow the will of the citizenry . 
   furthermore , the citizenry often does n't see the bigger picture , which the establishment needs to take into regard . 
  that is tautology . 
  it is a math concept . 
  in plain english : the establishment makes itself indispensable . 
  too important to fail . 
   if you ask people dozens of specific questions about specific issues every day , you are going to get stupid answers . 
  is that how you want the state to be run ? 
  i already explained that i want two houses . 
  the house of commons would have the option to veto or nullify or to propose ( and in some iterations pass ) its own legislation . 
  i fear you are lacking understanding about what democracy is . 
   it is not a yelling concert ... 
  it is a yelling concert if that is one legal way to express one 's decision . 
  k\u00e4rajad and the novgorod veche were just that . 
  any legal means of expressing one 's decision on a specific issue would be fine . 
   it is meant to be free choice of the best leaders and representation of all opinion groups , not a direct democracy . 
  that is the scheme that the establishment tries to advertise to the citizenry . 
  but those mind games do not work any more , because the establishment has lost its intellectual advantage and because wrong positions are not defensible for long . 
   i am internally divided whether you are part of the people , who should n't be let to make decisions for us in the first place , or whether you are really so naive to think that all people are capable of decent decisionmaking and that the will of the majority is somehow the best in every issue . 
  that becomes an issue only after you have decided whether to continue to falsely label your sistema as democracy or use its proper name ( whatever it is , not democracy ) . 
    o n average , only 50 % of representatives change in one election . 
  and not because of lack of effort from the voters . 
  the parties remain in 90 + % of cases . 
   and what exactly is the problem with that ? 
  if people are fine with the candidate they chose the last time , why should n't they vote for that party ? 
  you are not fooling anyone . 
  the electoral system of estonia was designed to create the establishment . 
  taagepera himself has admitted that . 
   no , some parties are part of the establishment as the coalition government , while others are clearly not part of the establishment . 
  all parties are part of the establishment . 
  it shows as the coalition would rather accept ekre than accept referenda . 
  the coalition hates its own citizens more than it hates ekre . 
    through a referendum  we had that in 1992 . 
  we do n't need to have it every half a year ... we can have an everlasting referendum , while still making decisions . 
   ( you really screwed your intelligence with this claim ) you are not very convincing . 
   absolute bullshit . 
  supporting mass immigration is one such example . 
  see on tavaline loogikaviga . 
  on page 36 : http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/eb/eb83/eb83_first_en.pdf if 56 % of the citizens of the eu member states want to limit immigration from outside of eu , and if 34 % would want no limits to immigration , then the probability ( of representative democracy ) that 23 eu member states out of 28 would vote for limitless immigration is about 230 parts per billion . 
  if the standard deviation of polling results is 1,5 % , then the confidence bounds for 6-sigma would be 9 % from the mean . 
  even at that 6-sigma confidence border , the probability of 23 out of 28 states voting for limitless immigration would be about 1/5000 . 
  so the chances that we are dealing with a democracy are pretty slim .

  demagoogia . 
  it most certainly is one criterion . 
   we already did . 
  that was one year and one season and one electorate . 
  and you are deceiving , we did not have a referendum on that . 
   continuous and everlasting referendums is a logical fallacy . 
  it is n't . 
  internet network communication does that continuously all the time . 
  it works . 
   no , i merely represent the common understanding among the majority of legal and political scientists in the world . 
  you mean part of the establishment . 
   perhaps you should n't argue with your maths degree on that issue ?

  you get 144 euros a month/1728 euros a year of tax free income , but anything above that is indeed 20 % for everyone . 
  oh erepublik , have n't heard of it for a long long time . 
  it was a fun game . 
  considering istanbul is metropolitan city of nearly 10 million inhabitants that is literally split in half and connected only by two bridges , i 'd say losing some trees is a smaller problem than the massive congestion that the limited access causes . 
  you remember the chechen war ? 
  apparently nazi female ski-shooters from the baltics were fighting for the chechens back then ( according to the russian media ) . 
  constantly blaming us for being nazis and oppressing our russian minorities . 
  having neo-nazi parades ( that were actually war memorial for wwii veterans ) etc. 
  that has been literally a constant topic for russia . 
  russia is an abusive ex who ca n't handle that he 's no longer wanted and tries to convince us that we had a much better life with him . 
  i do n't think so . 
  it probably was back in year 1995 or so . 
  but given he 's been spending the last 20 years in estonia and in estonian politics , i think his estonian is very good by now . 
  for its symbolic value . 
  we can kill you here , in the public , 100 meters from kremlin and noone can touch us still . 
  i wish you 'd just said `` ends in ussia '' so it could 've been prussia as well . 
  not only russia . 
  my young , liberal , estonian friends also believe that a ) putin was definitely not behind it b ) someone anti-putin was behind it . 
  yeah , but ownership is not just about the fruits , it 's also about responsibility and risk . 
  what your suggesting is that every worker should also take much more risk , what if he does n't want to ? 
  neither is yours . 
  why should the workers always be collective owners ? 
  do they all want to be entrepreneurs in a socialist society ? 
  every worker takes financial risks running the company ? 
  whom would it possibly help ? 
  if capitalists had machines that could do all work , workers wo n't be needed and all wealth is created by the capitalist . 
  no-one else is taking their fruits . 
  however they could n't have created everything with just their labour , they also need the capital . 
  therefore the provider of the capital also has a right to parts of the `` fruits '' . 
  thanks for being honest . 
  by our definition of human rights choosing to wear a face veil is not an infringement of human rights . 
  forcefully mutilating other people 's genitals is an infringement and we therefore ban such acts . 
  i do , by the way , think that forcing someone to wear a veil is an infrigement that should be banned . 
  banning running around naked absolutely is an infringement of a persons freedom . 
  however there are cases where freedoms can be limited . 
  these infringements must be justified and very well justified . 
  i do n't think the reasons given to justify the banning of full veils is not justified to the extent that is required to limit people 's freedom . 
  i have in fact not heard of a single female suicide bomber in europe although i ca n't say there has n't been any . 
  but this is besides the point . 
  what you must show is that wearing the veil increases the chance they start blowing themselves up not that people who wear veils will blow themselves up . 
  what if after the ban of full veils people with not full veils start blowing themselves up ? 
  or do you really think the veil is the thing making them go full-terrorist ? 
  most countries have laws that say you must be identifiable to law enforcement agents . 
  which means if the agent has a right to demand your identification , you must provide it - i.e show your face and documents . 
  this is perfectly normal . 
  there is however no need for everyone to be able to identify everyone at every time . 
  people are allowed privacy you know , even if they are located in a public place if there 's not a clear need for identification . 
  for the fear to be rational we must show that wearing full veil causally increases crime or terrorism . 
  trying to be a liberator of women by forcing them to abandon their traditions sounds very very soviet by the way . 
  `` we will drag you to the modernity ... by your fucking hair '', 
  should not or must not ? 
  how is that double standards ? 
  we have our standards and they ha e their standards . 
  these standards are different , but they 're not double standards as two different groups individually have coherent standards . 
  or the people should get over their irrational fear that is entirely caused by predjudice and fear-mongering . 
  now , i actually agree that if people demand the ban and they have a reasonable majority , they have a right to ban it , i 'm just saying it 's not the right thing to do . 
  because we 're a free society where people can wear what they want and iran is a theocratic dictatorship where people ca n't wear what they want ... 
   it pose security threat does it though ? 
  is there causal relationship between the number of people wearing full veil and crime ? 
  holy shit that ussr . 
   i do n't believe it . 
  do n't believe what ? 
  holy shit man . 
  that 's why there are representatives of the public to lead the negotiations . 
  that 's why governments exist in the first place , to lead . 
  and you ca n't have an idea how difficult of a process negotiating a trade deal of this magnitude really is , otherwise you would n't be saying so naive things . 
  what you 're advocating for is complete inefficiency and the eventual collapse of civilisation . 
  nothing would ever get done . 
  yeah i must agree , some aid definitely has been beneficial , while some has n't and we should look carefully for what works and go with that . 
  it 's just awfully often do we stumble upon unintended consequences . 
  the most effective aid is probably education , health and infrastructure . 
  giving a `` fish '' may be necessary at times , but must be very very limited . 
  unfortunately it is a problem . 
  it would n't be a problem for an advanced and rich nation that has good access to world markets and is capable of quickly switching what they produce . 
  in a nation where 90 % of the people earn living through agriculture , if you dump their market , they 're not going to go into another well paying industry , there simply is n't any . 
  yes , it might work in a few decades , but not within the time frames , we 're talking about here . 
  and if they do become dependant on food imports , they also become dependant on the world market prices and they need money to import these goods . 
  these poor economies often lack the capability to import food , hence why they have the famine in the first place . 
   but what if farmers were exporting food ? 
  they can still export food -- it 's not as if receiving food prevents export , as long as that export is profitable exporting food is n't easy , food expires and is strictly regulated ( in eu and usa ) . 
  besides eu and usa are massively subsidising their agriculture that imakes their products uncompetitive . 
  but the lack of infrastucture still stands , where are you going to export your crops when you have to travel 500 miles of shady mud-road to get to the nearest airport ? 
  in estonia it is very clear that russians marry before estonians do , and i 'd bet they have children before as well . 
   it 's still dumping food onto the market and decreasing market rate . 
  that is also a problem . 
  and a serious problem when it comes to long term food aid . 
  namely it makes it less profitable for local producers to produce food , meaning you basically dump them out from the market . 
  making the nation even more dependant of foreign aid . 
  this problem is very clear in haiti for example , that basically feeds off of foreign aid and local agriculture is simply unable to retake the market . 
  to be fair , the `` help '' the west sent to africa probably did more harm than good to these countries . 
  that 'd be an interesting statistic to see where are the new weapons , supplies and ammunition bought from . 
  i would n't be so sure that the u.s. is up there . 
  that fazer blue colour is also super nice . 
  we do n't have the copter-line anymore . 
  the financial crisis and the accident bankrupted the company . 
  i seriously do n't know where this is coming from . 
  must be taking different ships or something . 
  azerbaijan is most europe , european games , european gp , europe strong in azerbaijan . 
  soviets had a reasonable amount of success . 
  most of the east was illiterate and agrarian before ww2 .

  there is no war in estonia and life here should be an upgrade from `` certain death in war '' . 
  estonia took 150 . 
  hand picked `` refugee '' families . 
  at least 71 have already escaped estonia . 
  free flats and estonian level welfare is not good enough for them . 
  these people are welfare tourists not refugees . 
  he was certainly talking only about lithuanian clubs . 
  there are different dynamics at play there . 
  lithuanian players are fanatics and american/black players see playing there as a possibility to get noticed and picked up by richer league . 
  has to be something about the latvian government . 
  for example them throwing pensioners to streets to house these canadian rapists . 
  mount olympus, 
  their lives are in danger because they climbed on a boat and then sunk it themselves . 
  their lives would be just as much in danger if they doused themselves in gasoline , held a lighter and threaten to set themselves on fire unless taken to germany . 
  those fascists clearly do n't share european values and must be kicked out of the eu and nato . 
  germany 's `` solution '' might be just to fine you for every one who leaves the country and bring them back when caught otherwere in europe . 
  no human rights broken this way . 
  i guess germany wants to force you to keep them . 
  that 's just nonsense . 
  you might have vaguely heard something about the suwalki gap , but remembered wrong and posted something totally unrelated instead . 
  rand study is based on how things were in 2015 . 
  it has gotten better by now . 
  each baltic state and poland has nato armor battalions deployed there now . 
  another example of how you guys are absolutely incapable of self reflection and taking responsibility . 
  your mentality shows the wisdom of these who knew russia is a threat . 
  they knew that sooner or later russia will come up with some bullshit , invade estonia and says it is america 's fault . 
  that is if estonia is not in nato . 
  west gave russia every benefit of doubt and was ready for good relations . 
  russia just does n't want this . 
  they want more land . 
   russia was n't posing a threat ( from the early 90s to the late 00s ) some people naively believed russia was n't posing a threat . 
  by now it is quite obvious that these people were wrong . 
  overwhelming majority of russians are ultra-nationalists . 
  i think if i were an ukrainian living in lviv i 'd just take a day trip to krakow . 
  it is just 326 km . 
  yeah ... it sucks . 
  it sends a message to would-be-traitors that even when you get caught then russians will just kidnap an estonian officer and exchange you for him . 
   russian are still holding abducted estonian citizen . 
  we got him back trading him against an imprisoned traitor who had been spying for russia . 
  i remember that there used to be one `` unbreakable union '' , that was supposed to be forever . 
  what exactly are you talking about ? 
  when was the last time nato had maneuvers with 100,000 troops at russian border ? 
  i am guessing never . 
  germany , norway , back home . 
  latvia also removed it . 
  that russian thing shows huge lack of self awareness . 
  the most recent thing was russia lashing out at latvia . 
  namely there were some russian advance troops killed by latvians in 1940 - the time when russians were still allied with nazi germany . 
  russia demanded that the monument for those invading latvia in 1940 must be preserved or else ... 
  you made a false claim , admitted your general ignorance and are now frantically scanning wikipedia do find something you can use to justify your pulled-out-of-ass beliefs . 
  your expertise in this matter is literally 5 minutes spent scanning the wikipedia and that `` expertise '' was gained after you made your claims . 
  estonia was sent 150 quota refugees so far . 
  they were given furnished apartments , welfare money and support persons . 
  that is more than estonia does for down on luck people like homeless here . 
  yet at least 71 of these have already left ( `` escaped '' ) estonia . 
  it is not too hard to `` escape '' of course as in the easiest case you 'd just buy a bus ticket to germany . 
  estonia and latvia were among the few most literate countries in the world at that time . 
  estonian literacy rate was 95 % in 1897 . 
  when you compare estonia to france or finland and the effect of ussr you should use the 1992 data as this was when the soviet occupation ended . 
   giving the refugees the chance to live at the country 's standards what do you mean by that ? 
  for example [ latvia had 96 % gdp per capita of france in 1938 ] ( http://i.imgur.com/gylmcjo.png ), 
  how ungrateful . 
  it was nato core who liberated netherlands and got your bicycles back from them nazis . 
  you should worship the ground i walk on . 
  i believe i am nato here and i determine what is debt and what is not . 
  get ready for being hit by a cruise missile . 
  it is written in the article . 
  i know , but i wo n't tell you . 
  you have to click yourself . 
  well , the eu can then fine eastern europe . 
  already when the `` escaped '' refugees are caught in western europe the transportation back is at the cost of the host country . 
  at least 71 of the 150 quota refugees have `` escaped '' estonia already . 
  that sets pretty low bar for `` desperacy '' if getting free apartment , free money and support persons in peaceful estonia is not satisfactory . 
  300 billion for start , but it is much much more . 
  i have decided to roleplaying as nato here . 
  if german is not going to pay their nato debt then i am just going to take it by force . 
  nobody likes a deadbeat . 
  also if somebody says they disagree with me on something they should know that i have the military might of nato behind me . 
  that snarky comment might have just earned you a bullet in the head . 
  it is just budget . 
  greece has received money from many other sources plus had their debts forgiven . 
  shut up and pay the nato debt to trump . 
  does aitvaras mean anything in lithuanian . 
  in estonian the words literally means : ait - storage-house varas - thief, 
  i downvoted him for posting a huge collection of the same old bullshit that i just do n't bother with responding any more . 
  hey !, 
  i am not a kettle !, 
  sorry , but you did n't make points . 
  you are also absolutely ignorant about the issues and facts . 
  you just know that you have a side and that is why you throw out your ignorant fact free drivel . 
  by the time soviet union collapsed latvians and estonians were becoming minorites in their own countries . 
  just a decade more and it would have been the case . 
  no he is actually wrong and you are wrong . 
  simple . 
  just import 10 million of them . 
  then have a referendum and the join russia side will win . 
  after that you are russia forever . 
  even if broken clock is right twice a day you are wrong this time . 
  you 're absolutely ignorant about the issue and yet you still feel the need to write walls of hateful drivel . 
  if life supposedly sucks for someone they should get a citizenship .

  most people i know would say _ p\u00e4rap\u00f5rgu _ instead . 
  less prepositions than english * also the prespositions * ilma * ( without ) and * koos * ( with ) can be dropped from sentences . 
  pr is a hell of a drug, 
  finnish does n't really have a single word for every meaning of `` please '' , but they often use the english word in qolloquial speech . 
  do icelanders do the same ? 
  we also do n't have any articles , prepositions or the verb _ to have _ . 
  we actually do have a word for `` siblings '' which is '' \u00f5ved '' , but it 's only used in technical jargon and never in real life . 
  icelandic has a lot of these . 
   estonian does n't have this hardening as often as finnish , has this letter \u00f5 estonian also uses the letter \u00dc , while finnish uses y. 
  the letter \u0160 and \u017d are a bit more common in estonian while finnish often uses sh and zh . 
   estonian/finnish/saami would be hard do sami languages sound so similar to estonian and finnish ? 
  sami is so distant that i can only understand some words , but i quess it does _ sound _ very similar especially if you 're not familliar with the languages . 
  yeah , it is the actual name of the town , but it was intentionally made up for promotional purposes . 
  english does n't really have many more words than any other language has on an average . 
  what , really ? 
  this sounds like something straight out of / r/tumblrinaction, 
   the feminist party of course there 's a feminist party in sweden . 
   russo-norwegian pidgin language up there . 
  you mean [ russenorsk ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/russenorsk ) ? 
  i 've read a little about it , it 's really interesting . 
   tallinna tv is municipal and very strongly left-leaning , to a degree pro-russian too . 
  tallinna tv is my favourite estonian comedy channel . 
  you should watch `` terviseminutid '' with doctor vassiljev , it 's hilarious !, 
  i 'm from a small village in l\u00e4\u00e4ne-viru county . 
  most people spoke estonian , but there were also some russian speakers and a gypsy family who spoke some kind of a gypsy language , but now because the village next to us ( vao ) started taking refugees in you can often also hear english , arabic , french and some african languages being spoken . 
  not really . 
  there are some halloween parties and once some kids came knocking on my door in costumes , but i did n't have any candy for them because i did n't expect that anyone would show up . 
  the sea triggers your viking instincts . 
  clement `` puppey '' ivanov - professional dota 2 player, 
   on a more serious note , much of the estonian countryside is like this , especially the l\u00e4\u00e4ne-viru county til i 'm a redneck . 
  such things are pretty common . 
  loan words often go under a semantic shift and the word 's definition changes a little . 
  in english `` kielbasa '' does not mean sausage , it means a certain kind of sausage and it 's not incorrect to say `` kielbasa sausage '' . 
  other similar words : naan bread , chai tea , sahara desert , sombrero hat, 
  i lately noticed a funny thing about the word * viht * . 
  in estonian * vihaga l\u00f6\u00f6ma * means `` to hit with a a * viht * '' , but coincedentally it also means `` to hit with anger '' . 
  i 'm actually playing crusader kings ii right now as estonia . 
  trying to invade finland at the moment . 
  the reasoning behind it is that i 'm estonian and i really want invade finland . 
  while i use english pretty much every day , i do n't technically * speak * it very often . 
  the foreign language i use the most for actual real life conversations is finnish , since i often visit my finnish speaking cousins in finland and vice versa . 
   m\u00f8rke ( darkness ) i just realised that it 's very similar to the english word [ * murk * ] ( http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/murk ), 
  oh and we also have two places named `` kullimaa '' . 
  well i 've always considered estonia western . 
  it supposedly has some fans in foreign countries like venezueala , which is very rare for estonian shows . 
  [ article ] ( http://news.err.ee/v/47d29f99-8b8a-4674-9dd4-b330cf6eb588 ), 
  nah , it comes directly from german , i checked the estonian etymological dictionary . 
  well these sorts of things often have many speculated origins and we probably will never know for sure . 
   gardinen til not only did we get the saying from the germans , the estonian word for curtain was also loaned from them . 
  i googled it and apparently it originated in germany during the thirty year 's war when swedes invaded germany . 
   yeah the problem with french is that nobody really outside of france or africa speaks it french is also spoken in belgium and switzerland . 
   finns often have this finnish squint finns confirmed mongol . 
  he means that we are not ethnically or linguistically baltic or slavic , which is true . 
  we are actually finnic people like finns . 
  in estonian `` istu minu k\u00f5rvale '' means `` sit next to me '' , but in finnish `` istu minun kyrv\u00e4lle '' means `` sit on my dick '' '' \u00c4mm '' in estonian means `` mother in law , but `` old hag '' in finnish . 
  in estonia kids do n't play tag , they play `` kulli '' ( dick in finnish ), 
  everything you just said about finnish also applies to estonian , except we can say ` omas kakas ' even when speaking formally . 
   paskat means look in latvian , but apparently shit in finnish shit in finnish is ` paska ' , in estonian it 's ` pask ' . 
  do you learn both at school ? 
  how many books , newspapers , internet sites and such are written in cyrillic ? 
  are there any demographics that tend to use cyrillic more than latin ? 
   now , imagine the text written only with the letters of the english alphabet . 
  would it look ... ugly and strange to you ? 
  yeah , but only because i 'm not used to it . 
   there 's the other thing - that there are not enough letters for all of our sounds . 
  there 's no such equivalent . 
  we have the same sound in estonian and we write it as \u00d5 ( \u00f5 ) , but other languages like polish use y instead . 
  does n't matter if he 's famous . 
  well the askhenazi jews speak yiddish , which is closely related to german . 
  i 'm always slightly annoyed when the british flag is called the flag of england , which happens a lot here . 
  i have mostly read donald duck comics , which are originally from the us , but nowadays many of the stories are written and illustrated by europeans ( there are a lot of italians for example ) and i 'm also interested in asterix comics , which are from france . 
  lately american and japanese comics have also started to appear , but they 're not that common . 
  kunda is also a name of an estonian town . 
  iceland, 
  but does kinda make sense to name them that , does n't it ? 
  lihapallid * but atleast you got the first half of the word right . 
   i think you perhaps made a mistake with ` arst ' for doctor , as it is spelled ` arts ' . 
  in estonian ` arst ' is the correct spelling . 
  what city exactly are you talking about ? 
  estonian has gotten a lot of words from low saxon . 
  if you 're interested then here 's a big pile of estonian words that come from low saxon : kool ` school ' , neer ` kidney ' , ribi ` rib ' ; kruus ` gravel ' , torm ` storm ' ; botany : k\u00f5rvits ` pumpkin ' , peet ` beet ' , salat ` salad ' , petersell ` parsley ' , m\u00fcnt ` coin ' , k\u00f6\u00f6men ` caraway , cumin ' , loorber ` laurel ' , palm ` palm ( tree ) ' , tamm ` dam ' , roos ` rose ' , ploom ` plum ' ; hunt ` wolf ; hound ' culinary : k\u00f6\u00f6k ` kitchen ' , kruubid ` groat ' , kringel ` kringle , type of pastry ' , pannkook ` pancake ' , pekk ` lard ' , prantssai ` type of pastry ' , s\u00fclt ` brawn ' , vorst ` sausage ' , \u00f5li ` oil ' , t\u00e4rklis ` starch ' , pruukost ` breakfast ' , kruus ` mug ' , pann ` pan ' , p\u00fctt ` barrel ' , korv ` basket ' , l\u00e4hker ` bota ' , toober ` tub ' , tiik ` pond ' , lamp ` lamp ' , l\u00fchter ` chandelier ' clothing : k\u00e4\u00e4rid ` scissors ' , teljed ` looms ' , vokk ` spinning wheel ' , l\u00f5uend ` canvas ' , samet ` velvet ' , siid ` silk ' , vilt ` felt ' , kuub ` coat ' , k\u00f6rt ` skirt ' , loor ` veil ' , m\u00fcts ` cap ' , muda ` mud ' , mantel ` coat ' , p\u00fcksid ` pants , trousers ' , vammus ` coat ' , n\u00f6\u00f6p ` button ' architecture : hoov ` courtyard ' , h\u00e4\u00e4rber ` mansion ' , kelder ` cellar ' , kemmerg ` toilet ' , korsten ` chimney ' , ruum ` room ' , saal ` hall ' , tall ` stables ' , trepp ` stairs ' , vall ` wall , ridge ' , v\u00f5lv ` vault ' technology : haamer ` hammer ' , hing ` hinge ' , h\u00f6\u00f6vel ` planer ' , kellu ` trowel ' , kapp ` cupboard ' , pink ` bench ' , tool ` stool ' ; jaht ` hunt ' , j\u00e4\u00e4ger ` hunter , hunt manager , game warden ' , kants ` stronghold ' , k\u00fctt ` hunter ' , laager ` camp ' , lahing ` battle ' , piir ` border ' , p\u00fcss ` gun , rifle ' , t\u00e4\u00e4k ` bayonet ' , vaht ` watch ' religion : altar ` altar ' , ingel ` angel ' , j\u00fcnger ` disciple ' , psalm ` psalm ' , prohvet ` prophet ' , salm ` verse ' , preester ` priest ' , troost ` consolation ' , pihtima ` to confess ' , v\u00f6\u00f6rm\u00fcnder ` church warden , beadle ' , piiskop ` bishop ' , sant ` beggar , cripple ' people : preili ` miss , maiden ' , memm ` old woman ' , mats ` boor , hick ' , h\u00e4rra ` gentleman ' , proua ` lady ' , kelm ` dodger , rascal , cheat ' , narr ` joker , fool ' , naaber ` neighbour ' , kuller ` courrier ' , laat ` fair , market ' , selts ` society , club ' , krahv ` count ' , saks ` german , nobleman ' , arst ` doctor ' , plaaster ` tape , plaster ' ; hangeldama ` smuggle ' , k\u00fc\u00fcrima ` scour ' , tingima ` to bargain ' measures : kortel ` quartern ' , matt ' a measure ' , toll ` inch ' , vaagima ` to weigh ' , viht ` weight ' , \u00fc\u00fcr ` rent ' , paar ` pair ' , piik ` spike , lance ' , tosin ` dozen ' , veerand ` quarter ' ; n\u00e4\u00e4rid ` new year ' , reede ` friday ' , tund ` hour ' , vastlad ` shrovetide ' nautical : ankur ` anchor ' , kiil ` keel ' , t\u00fc\u00fcr ` steer ' , praam ` pram , ferry ' , madrus ` sailor ' , pootsman ` boatswain ' , kotermann ` ship gremlin ' , loots ` pilot ' , kipper ` skipper ' arts : kaart ` map , card ' , kunst ` art ' , maaler ` painter ' , maalima ` to paint ' , paber ` paper ' , tr\u00fckkima ` to print ' , uurima ` to search , study , survey ' , trumm ` drum ' , tantsima ` to dance ' , piip ` pipe ' , vilepill ` whistle ' , pasun ` horn , trumpet ' ; just ` just , namely ' , topelt ` double ' , v\u00e4\u00e4rt ` valuable ' what do you think of these ? 
  i personally speak standard estonian , but my family in l\u00e4\u00e4ne-virumaa have a few dialectal differences like using the words `` too '' ( that ) and `` nood '' ( those ) instead of using `` see '' ( this ) and `` need '' ( these ) for everything like i do . 
  they also say `` tulivad '' ( they came ) like the finns do instead of the standard `` tulid '' . 
  that story is pretty much identical to the legend of the latvian flag . 
   finland is just like home but with an unintelligible language . 
  i would say pretty much the same , except their language is somewhat understandable for us even if we have n't learned it . 
  native : estonian fluent : english conversational : finnish really basic : russian in estonia we learn english and russian in primary school . 
  i actually like how the dutch language sounds . 
  sauna has always been popular in northwestern europe and when the first saunas started to appear estonians and finns were probably still the same people anyway , so if they can say that they invented it , we can too . 
  estonian and finnish are uralic languages . 
  the altaic language tree itself is disputed and the similarities they have with uralic languages are mere coincidences . 
   there are several instances of words being spelled more consistently with pronunciation ( theatre/theater etc. ) . 
  sure , but that 's only some words and the british spellings are usually more familiar to speaker of romance languages like french . 
   also , for most europeans , americans are easier to understand than brits , which is a significant factor during language learning . 
  american english is n't inheritly easier to understand . 
  while i have problems with understanding some british dialects ( scottish for example ) , the standard received pronounciation is very easy to comprehend . 
  how is american english easier than british english ? 
  more of a misconception than a stereotype , but whatever - that we 're slavs or balts we 're actually finnic people like finns . 
  when the estonians , who colonized the congo came back , they realised that it 's bloody cold here , so they decided to replicate the african climate in small wooden houses and thus created the sauna . 
   i got a real one .

  northern europe . 
  so sweden is a baltic state ? 
  what common history besides the soviet occupation do estonia and lithuania have then ? 
  i 'm not arguing against the fact that such a convention exists , i am pointing out how baseless that conventional understanding is in the first place . 
  so an illegal foreign occupation changed our geographical and cultural region ? 
  dude , get smart . 
  because you guys are obsessive in being ignorant and having a bias . 
  how are the baltic states and slavic countries less unique than estonia ? 
  what is that even ? 
  you can be unique among similar entities - england can be unique among germanic countries because it has a lot of romance influences , but england is not more unique if compared to russia , estonia or uganda . 
  our new leftist government will most likely change this a bit . 
   also , i heard a rumor , that you use your alcohol tax ( our money ) to fund culture and youth sports . 
  is that true ? 
  why would n't that be true ? 
  what do you do with alcohol tax then ? 
  yet estonia and denmark had strong contacts before estonia was occupied by the soviets . 
  as your entire nation forgot about that and built up a negative stigma for illegally occupied close friends , you really need to look yourself in the mirror . 
  better read up some history about the relations , your whole nation should . 
   estonia is n't and will probably never ( in the nearest future ) be considered a part of the `` nordics '' why so ? 
  estonia has [ loads in common with the nordic countries ] ( http://www.nordicestonia.com/ ) . 
   seeing as its more than just a geographical group of countries . 
  of course it is . 
   but they 're also one of the eastmost countries in europe so is finland . 
  even more so in fact . 
   which means labeling them as a part of eastern europe is n't really wrong . 
  yet it 's more wrong than calling us northern europe . 
   the whole baltic area is a bit of a middle ground you mean [ this ] ( http://s3platform.jrc.ec.europa.eu/documents/20182/96197/map+bsr+2/c90bdd92-dec0-4aa2-80d3-5314b082f1f0?t=1448382202236 ) ? 
  for me the personally most valuable items are : - an estonian language bible from the 1880s with decorated covers and with my family inscriptions inside it from the 1880s until about 1940 . 
  - a box of silver spoons with my great-grandfather 's initials on it from about 1935 . 
  it was the only item my great-grandfather got out of his house besides his wife and my 1 year old grandmother during the [ bombing of tallinn ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bombing_of_tallinn_in_world_war_ii#red_air_force_raids_in_1944 ) in 1944 , when their neighbor 's house got a direct hit and their house burned down . 
  there was one spoon missing from the box - the spoon my great-grandparents were giving medication to my grandmother with . 
  it was left there on their kitchen table . 
  these are also the only two items i have asked my parents to leave me once . 
  perhaps for some people material value is more important , but not for me . 
  estonian football team is usually dominated by ethnic russians . 
  reason is simple - football was a lot more popular among russian immigrants and estonians sort of found other sports as watching russian-dominated games was rather boring . 
  it has regained some ground among estonians , but it 's still not the most popular sport among us , while it most likely is among local russians . 
  i 'm starting french in january , hopefully will continue with courses for several years . 
  still not a foreign country , 
  ah , to actually go school to another country , every day !, 
  really cool !, 
  so far as a poor student , i 've taken trips to latvia about twice a year and to finland , lithuania and poland about every two years . 
  / this does n't correspond to all the places where i 've been , just the more regular visits . 
  it 's beautiful until it 's all you hear around you . 
  they are northeastern europe with little ties to the `` rest '' of eastern europe and a lot more ties to the rest of northern europe . 
   its a pretty meaningless and outdated term ** outside of that ** . 
  thank you !, 
  but really , why is estonia baltic when sweden is n't ? 
  neither estonians , nor swedes are baltic peoples . 
  even that , what makes estonia baltic ? 
  they are only in the context of cold war and the socio-economic aspects stemming from the soviet occupation . 
  in no other context though . 
   this kid lack of intelligence is just glimmering from your comment . 
  in what sense is estonia more eastern european than northern european ? 
  it 's not a flag union ... anyways , we 'll not change our national flag to satisfy some foreigners . 
  wtf again . 
  what does `` more unique than slavic '' mean ? 
  neither estonians , nor the baltic peoples are slavic . 
  and what does a tax system have to do with it ? 
  it really depends on the concept . 
  we are eastern europe in the context of cold war and the socio-economic aspects stemming from the soviet occupation , but calling us eastern european in any other aspect is just plain unintelligent . 
   no one here in the nordic countries actually considers estonia to be a part of northern europe wtf , did n't consider scandinavians to be that unintelligent . 
  the eu has a unicameral parliament . 
  basically just estonians , but there are some older minorities , who we are really ok with , like coastal swedes and the russian orthodox old believer communities ( i.e. 
  an old minority among the mostly newer russian minority ) . 
  plus some ingrian finns who have migrated to estonia after harsh repressions in russia . 
  in the summer haapsalu and kuressaare are both resort towns with charming old towns and medieval castles . 
  p\u00e4rnu is good for a summer beach holiday . 
  a couple of centuries ago , estonia ( * eesti * ) was for estonia , what georgia is to georgia . 
  in what i assume you think is eastern europe , how many common aspects to the entire region do you think these countries have ? 
  i mean , sure - socio-economic aspects related to the former socialist rule , but anything else ? 
  ca n't really see what estonia would specifically have in common with moldova or serbia . 
   eastern european  baltic states ugh , triggered !, 
  not their secession , but their right for self-determination ( i.e. 
  secession ) . 
  then there 's estonia - offering cultural autonomies for ethnic groups that barely exist in the country , like the ingrian finns and coastal swedes . 
  i still can not fathom how a democratic country could deny an indigenous ethnic group the right to self-determination . 
  this said , i support them having the right to referendum - whatever they decide and whether they become independent , i really do n't care as i could see them both as an independent country and as a part of spain . 
  estonians have a poetic sobriquet for estonia : [ terra mariana ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/terra_mariana ) ( estonian : * maarjamaa * - `` mary 's land '' ) , after mary , mother of jesus , who gave name to the medieval crusader country in the eastern baltic . 
  we could also return to our even older name for ourselves , the * maavald * - `` country parish '' !, 
  i honestly think there is close to zero correlation between how rural and urban people vote in estonia , other than ethnic russians living more [ or basically only ] in urban settlements and the estonian centre party gets more [ if not close to all ] of those votes . 
  i ca n't really show you a map because election maps sort of became irrelevant after the introduction of e-votes , which are only counted on the electoral district level ( of which there are just 12 ) . 
  the fingolian hordes at * vappu * ? 
  the teeth are supposed to resemble the stars on either of our flags . 
  right wing in general ( as opposed to the center and left-wing ) controls 58.4 % of the parliament and currently has 49 % support . 
  one party is in the coalition right now , but in general we have the first left-wing government in like , since the restoration of independence . 
  the radical right wing , the estonian national conservative party ( ekre ) controls 6.9 % of the parliament and currently has 12 % support . 
  anarchists are not people in my book . 
  even if your country was attacked ?? 
  and later they gave out estonian and baltic refugees to the ussr ... 
  [ estonia ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/45/laulupidu_2014_\\ ( 14401287610 \\ ) . jpg ) ( a scene from the estonian song festival ), 
  it is n't about the shock , it 's also the socio-historical buildup of these countries . 
  they have had distinct populations for thousands of years , while most of the us population are rather recent immigrants . 
  it 's an [ interesting subject ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/religion_in_azerbaijan ) in my opinion - they are rather thought to be almost universally muslim though . 
  you are ethno-culturally the same nation , unlike most of europe . 
  i mean , yeah without the wwii aspect , germany and austria are ethno-culturally the same and they could work well together in theory if they did n't have a long history of being separated . 
  this is not to say that these regions do n't have strong cultural divisions among them . 
  that 's relatively little , especially for a small country with several neighbors . 
  if you went to the netherlands or northern italy or switzerland , you 'd probably find a lot more foreigners among their ancestors . 
  it 'll happen soon enough .

  we do , people like to drive all over the country in the summer , but it takes up remarkably less time to reach any destination . 
  crossing borders into latvia is sometimes a thing , but usually going beyond riga or taking a ferry into finland or sweden is already traveling , so it 's not that `` pack your bags and lets go '' kind of trip . 
  the most popular locations are all kinds of summer festivals and i would say northern estonian peninsulas or western estonian islands . 
  people making public statements in a pub ? 
  what kind of social behavior is this ? 
  i almost died in +40 c in madrid ... 
  i do n't know , you have to be very quick to storm through very interesting sights . 
  the old town may take up several days with the better museums , viewing platforms and cafes , then there are the rotermann quarter and downtown , estonian museum of occupations , kadriorg and kadriorg park , pirita , views of the tallinn bay , the song festival grounds , tv tower , lasnam\u00e4e soviet architecture , kalamaja , estonian maritime museum at the seaplane harbour , estonian open air museum etc. 
  and these are all within the city limits . 
  iceland 's distance from russia . 
  this is seriously stupid . 
  why not just hang it on a wall and let the voter write [ a number in a box ] ( http://f9.pmo.ee/ojqphbyljipckh9frjqti1xckr4=/276x148/smart/nginx/o/2015/03/05/3838439t1h2130.jpg ) ? 
  free in tallinn with a rather good coverage . 
  it could offer some night rides , at least on friday and saturday nights though . 
  / incoming classical `` nothing is free '' comments . 
  well pizza deliveries are [ somewhat ] a thing , plus many people order groceries to their home once a week . 
  other than that i 'm sure you * can * order plenty of foods to your home , but not many people do that . 
  tallinn is often disregarded despite having one of the [ best-preserved old towns ] ( https://www.google.ee/search?q=tallinn+old+town&amp;client=opera&amp;hs=s4t&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewia8msdw67tahuhjjokhdryd1aq_auiccgb&amp;biw=1517&amp;bih=732 ) out there . 
  about 5 times . 
  twice for reckless drivers , twice for public violence within youth groups an once a drunk guy broke a door window of my property . 
  i 'm not sure about the first two as i did n't follow these cars . 
  with the youth groups i saw the police arrive quite quickly , but they had dispersed by then and the last time the police came and negotiated between me and the guy 's more sober friends , who promised to pay for the damages , which they did . 
  the second is just * hei * in estonian , a colloquial greeting could also be * heips * . 
  no , why should i eat twice in the evening ? 
  yes , before getting home and eating dinner . 
  the faroese singer [ eiv\u00f8r p\u00e1lsd\u00f3ttir ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsl-khge4kk ) is pretty amazing and so is the sami singer [ sofia jannok ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tu-np8zs4hq ) . 
  understandable , but they 've been in europe for a long time and it is n't even exactly certain that they lived on the other side of the urals . 
  plus `` european languages '' and `` asian languages '' is n't a thing anyway ... 
  there are uralic languages , indo-european languages , turkic languages etc. 
  the very first ones migrated migrated to the swedish colonies and later to the same areas where finns did ( dakotas , minnesota , wisconsin ) and quickly merged with them . 
  up until world war ii the new immigrants were mostly former peasants turned into rather left-wing labourers . 
  there were about 5,000 estonian americans in 1890 . 
  in 1944 , ca . 
  8 % of estonians fled to sweden and germany and from there , most continued to canada , the us ( ca . 
  15,000 ) , and australia . 
  there were about 25,000 estonian americans during the cold war and they were mostly right-wing intellectuals and bourgeoisie , who quickly merged with the american middle and upper middle classes . 
  biggest population centers were and still are in california and new york-new jersey . 
  in college , like every other day for two days . 
  now i mostly eat some cheap restaurant `` daily meals '' and do n't bother to eat much in the evening . 
  even more so ... what do you think the number of khanty and mansi speakers is if compared to hungarians ? 
  i usually go before 1 pm , although the later you go , the less hungry you will be in the evening , 
  i 'd rather emphasize the `` cheap '' part in this . 
  i read most of the estonian and many international classics in high school and i 've sort of stopped reading fiction since then . 
  i still read encyclopedias and other reference books , but nowadays i get most of my information on the internet . 
  lol , [ no ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/uralic_peoples ) . 
  the share of russians living in asia is far higher than the share of uralic people living in asia . 
  lol , no . 
  none of my ancestors ( i.e. 
  for at least 300 years ) have ever been out of europe . 
  i will most likely go to nyc in october though . 
  the russians . 
  mainstream parties ( social democrats , liberals and conservatives ) have replaced their old and strong leadership with the young and incompetent , who fail to offer anything new to the electorate . 
  meanwhile the right-wing populists have arisen and the mainstream conservatives have lost a lot of votes to them . 
  what is left of the conservatives , decided to kick out the long-time in power liberals from coalition and replace them with left-wing powers as the pro-russian leftist party replaced its long-time populist and very pro-russian leader with a young pro-western leadership . 
  it 's `` all fine for now '' as the coalition of pro-russian leftists , social democrats and conservatives will most likely hold , but : - russian voters may not support the pro-western party leadership for long ; - the support for conservatives will continue to fall and they may not fulfill the 5 % threshold in 2019 ; - the right-wing populists will only continue to grow support . 
  it may lead to a situation where two conservative parties wo n't fulfill the threshold and mainstream parties get less than 50 % of the seats . 
  then all the shit will hit the fan . 
  the oldest text i can fathom to have encountered in school was [ * oh , ma vaene tarto liin * ] ( https://et.wikisource.org/wiki/oh,_ma_vaene_tarto_liin ) ( `` oh , my poor tartu town '' ) from 1708 . 
  there 's really no point going beyond that - they would be incomprehensible , plus there are n't many decent estonian language texts from before . 
  oldest texts in curriculum were probably phrases from the national epic [ * kalevipoeg * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kalevipoeg ) . 
  it has ancient origins , but it was compiled and most of it written only in the mid 19th century . 
  and which european nations speak asian languages ? 
   from your experience , what is approximately the proportions of well integrated russians ( willing to learn the language , follow the local political discourse rather than russian language media , maybe other criteria that are important in your opinion ; or just generally tolerable at least ) to those that give bad reputation ? 
  plenty of young people , very few middle aged or old people . 
  many young people are so integrated you may find out years later that they are russians ( mind the name , a good number of estonians have a russian surname due to some russian ancestry ) . 
  but it political differences are very strongly in correlation with accent strength . 
  no accent usually means no political difference from estonians , slight accents can go both ways and strong accents and especially no language knowledge at all make up politically very pro-kremlin people . 
  and estonians are much more keen to speak russian with tourists from russia than they are with local russians . 
  heck , my first question to a person approaching me in russian would be * \u043e\u0442\u043a\u0443\u0434\u0430 \u0432\u044b ? 
  * there 's even a joke about it [ here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hk_g1mesle ) . 
   as for tourist , i believe because estonia was n't considered a tourist location of such scale as lithuania/latvia since soviet times , the ones that go to estonia are generally more open-minded maybe . 
  plus a huge share of our russian tourists are from st petersburg , especially its upper middle classes . 
  plus estonia has been one of the key resort destinations for st petersburg residents for centuries so they usually know where they are , they know the history , they know the history of russian presence here etc. 
  state officials , including mps , often have restrictions on their other activities . 
  for example : constitution of estonia : - \u00a7 63 . 
  a member of the riigikogu [ parliament ] may not hold any other governmental office . 
  members of the government of the republic may not hold any other governmental office , or belong to the management board or supervisory board of a commercial enterprise . 
  i 'm sure this applies to governmental offices in other countries as well as per intention of the paragraph . 
  you mean a tax besides the service fee , right ? 
  i remember that i got my own tv when i was about 8 and it was a huge thing . 
  but from the mid 2000s i rarely watched it and have n't owned a tv after moving out . 
  it feels like the older generations are much more connected to television than younger generations are . 
  edit : plus to avoid the long commercials , gosh how annoying they can be . 
  immigration for a long time for us has meant the russophone population . 
  only the younger generations speak decent estonian and most of the population definitely has not integrated well . 
  in other words , it has more or less been a forced-upon catastrophe for us . 
  mostly for heating up yesterday 's food , but sometimes also for heating up ready-to-eat food from the store . 
  luckily i quit eating defrosted food after graduating . 
  i think here it is very similar . 
  using our version of * sie * is only the case with someone at least 5 years older than yourself , or with someone in an indirect or official contact ( phone , a salesperson in a store etc ) . 
  i 'm sorry , if the visit by the specialists is paid by the municipality where the party is in power , then it sure does look questionable . 
  plenty of other criticism has been bs as well . 
   well , the risk is still betweenqthe chair and the keyboard , how do you know that the right person is voting and not someone knowing the credentials . 
  how do you know that the voter is free and not-under supervision . 
  this adds some risk , same goes with signatures . 
  we should be the only country which recognizes online signatures and you can just as well be forced to give a regular signature ... 
  well , you can also come vote physically after that and it will replace your online vote . 
  i 'm not getting into that lengthy argument , all has been said before in various reddit posts . 
  some of the criticism is valuable , some of it just dumb , some of it really does n't apply for estonia and some of it is just politically biased . 
  generally positive , but the right-wing and left-wing populists are strongly against them .

  the mass import of russians started during the soviet times . 
  finland was also under the russian empire until 1917 you know . 
  also , using your logic , countries like the netherlands or belgium should have turkish or arabic as one of their national languages . 
  yep . 
  during the soviet occupation massive amount of russians were imported into estonia . 
  a large difference compared to immigration into western europe is that all the immigrants were from one cultural group . 
  so integration is harder and in some areas of estonia it 's pretty easy to get by without speaking a word of estonian . 
  those people often get their news from kreml-controlled sources . 
  but the number of those people is decreasing constantly and most estonians get along fine with russians ( and vice versa ) . 
  all the russians i personally know have said that they would n't want estonia to be a part of russia . 
   as i mentioned somewhere else , the only reason janus and niklas chose estonia was because they had used those guys for kazaa earlier . 
  this is just simply wrong . 
  the way you 're wording your comment makes it seem that you think that kazaa was founded by janus and niklas who then used cheap estonian workforce write it . 
  when in reality it was made by those estonian guys who just sold it to them . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kazaa#history  kazaa and fasttrack were originally created and developed by estonian programmers from bluemoon interactive [ 1 ] including jaan tallinn and sold to niklas zennstr\u00f6m and janus friis ( who were later to create skype and later still joost and rdio ) . 
  -  i 'll put it this way , if estonia was the only country in the world skype would never have been made . 
  if estonia never existed , skype would still exist but the backend would just have been made somewhere else . 
  well we would n't know if it still would 've had become as popular as it did . 
  the idea itself was nothing groundbreaking . 
  i still do n't think that estonia was chosen just purely because they already personally knew those estonian guys . 
  there 's a reason why there 's such a large amount of tech start-ups in estonia you know ( especially considering in what terrible shape the country was just 20 years ago ) . 
  it has been an intentional choice of the government to invest into all kinds of it stuff . 
  starting from 1997 with tiigrih\u00fcpe http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tiigrih%c3%bcpe, 
  not really . 
  the estonian guys who wrote the original skype had previously worked together on kazaa with janus friis and niklas zennstr\u00f6m . 
  they personally knew each other . 
  you know . . developing software is n't the same as producing cheap shoes or whatever . 
  the cheaper cost of labor does n't really matter if you 're paying just three guys . 
  there 's countries where they would 've had to pay way less . 
   the skype software was originally developed by estonians ahti heinla , priit kasesalu and jaan tallinn , who together with janus friis and niklas zennstr\u00f6m were also behind the peer-to-peer file sharing software kazaa . 
  i assume in countries such as the netherlands it 's the norm . 
  but germans generally do n't speak english that well , so it 's not suprising . 
  are you completely mad ? 
  are you living in one of these post-soviet countries so that you can make such a statement ? 
  i do , and i ca n't even express in words how wrong you are . 
  the ussr made a lot of propaganda about being efficient , organized and livable -- but it was n't actually true . 
  it was a totalitarian regime . 
  information was heavily controlled . 
  in the case of cargo it 's more about the cost than speed . 
  oil tankers for example are very slow , but very popular for cargo . 
  it 's extremely unlikely that any country will be using the hyperloop in the next 30 years or so . 
  also , rail baltica is largely about cargo transport -- which is n't going to be replaced by the hyperloop anyway . 
   i do n't want to sound pompous , but of course some people from certain countries like denmark , or even poland , would n't mind . 
  they do n't have a cultural `` super '' power status like france or spain . 
  france is a cultural superpower ? 
  maybe in the past . 
  during modern times the cultural influence of denmark and the scandinavia in general is considerably greater than that of france . 
  tv-series , films , design , various companies known all over the world , music , modern cuisine , etc. 
  you brits really like o 's it seems . 
  it 's interesting that swedes buy alcohol from finland . 
  does this only happen in the north where the countries connect ? 
  the distance from stockholm to tallinn and helsinki is the same . 
  why are n't the swedes buying alcohol from estonia ? 
  this map is made by some random guy on wikipedia . 
  no idea what his nationality is . 
  i think they included it under wine . 
  south-west britain belongs to the wine/beer belt here . 
  ( i did n't make this map . 
  it 's not oc . ), 
  this shows what alcohol has traditionally been drunken and produced in various countries . 
  this does n't necessarily show what is currently the most popular alcoholic drink . 
  for example sweden ( which is in the beer-vodka belt ) drinks more wine than beer or vodka . 
  you can see this from here : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_alcohol_consumption, 
  * richer neighbour . 
  one neighbour . 
  finland . 
  these are the traditional alcohol belts of europe and it may not be representative of what is currently the most popular alcoholic drink . 
  for example swedes and norwegians drink more wine and beer than vodka during modern times . 
  this wikipedia link shows alcohol consumption per capita and breaks it down by type of alcohol : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_alcohol_consumption edit : but estonia still totally follows this trend . 
  [ damn . 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/uuvledk.png ) edit2 : but if you also include the unrecorded vodka ( the illegally made alcohol ) , then countries like moldova or russia would probably beat us . 
  i did think of adding them , but the map was getting kind of cluttered and these countries have pretty much the same name in english . 
  andorra , monaco , luksemburg , liechtenstein , vatikan , san marino . 
  i think vene meant boat in older estonian . 
  or at least that 's what my history teacher told me . 
  i believe the rootsi / ruotsi name possibly comes from the rus people . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rus'_people they also gave russia it 's name in most languages . 
  oops . 
  makedoonia . 
  i 've actually heard that the name `` venemaa '' comes from the fact that the russians came to estonia with boats over the lake peipus . 
  well judging this as an estonian , they 're definitely making fun of russians . 
  this is possibly a part of some kind of a viral campaign for the mineral water he 's mentioning in the end . 
  pisa just shows how well different students all over the world have taken a specific test . 
  the test is different every year , but the way the countries rank is n't that different . 
  so i would n't say that it 's complete bullshit . 
  it 's not all a country should care about when designing it 's education system , but it also should n't be ignored . 
  also , the results for the timss test are n't that different from pisa . 
  it 's still generally the same countries that are doing well and not so well . 
  would you still think that it 's garbage if denmark would happen to do well in it ? 
  many languages around the baltic sea may have similar words because of the old german influence . 
  for example in estonian trousers is `` p\u00fcksid '' and in danish it 's `` bukser '' . 
  they sound similar . 
  although they 're not similar languages and are from completely different language groups ( north-germanic and finnic ) . 
  also , `` perkele '' is n't a 100 % finnish word either http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/perkele, 
  i guess so . 
  but religion is still kind of important in this context i think . 
  turkey is one of the most liberal muslim countries there is . 
  their version of islam is more compatible with current european values . 
  i would n't say that religion plays no part . 
  religion is a very important factor in what is your world view .

  i go to amazon.com and the wide selection of produce infuriates me , i want there only the things ** i ** need . 
  that took a while . 
  its zaha hadid , many of her buildings look like some kind of water transportation thingies . 
  i do n't mind them . 
  pretty sure in the future people will be jizzing all over them - she is considered quite `` avangard '' , hence the alienation from general public . 
  first of all , authoritarianism has fundamenatl problem with power cycle . 
  you depend on a wellbeing on very small circle of people , or even worse , on one man . 
  if something happens to one man , whole country can fall into chaos . 
  secondly . 
  country that is afraid of freedoms is weak by definition . 
  only confident and healthy society can allow maximum freedoms and democracy . 
  when you dismantle democracy right after the election , you are authoritarian . 
  i really do n't understand people who think the way you do . 
  the only thing they are showing is that they are weak . 
  authoritarianism is sign of weakness , not strength . 
  heh , yes . 
  i have no problem with that . 
  discussion is healthy !, 
  do n't worry , when more votes/popularity is lost she 'll start using force . 
  it 's very predictable . 
  i 'd say it varies . 
  some are not interested in politics , some are more liberal and western minded ( like my parents ) , and some are very pro-putin ( older generation i know and many friends of the family ) . 
  some heated discussions on holidays and birthdays when people come for a visit , 
  i do n't hide the fact that i 'm quite passionately against putin - i have no idea how any sensible person would actually support him . 
  but look through my comment history , i 'm against any far-right , nationalist and fascist movement . 
  usually when putin is more on the news i take proportionally more shots at his hypocrisy . 
  he 's been repeating the same thing every day since the downing . 
  seems like he really needs it . 
  again with the silly . 
  learning a language is not making lives as difficult as possible - it is a standard that pretty much every country in the world follows . 
  look at the history before making such remarks . 
  in regards to you article . 
  you should have read to the end . 
  this is what putin said in 2012 . 
   we must create the conditions for immigrants to normally integrate into our society , learn russian and , of course , respect our culture and traditions and abide by russian law . 
  in this regard , i believe that the decision to make learning the russian language compulsory and administer exams is well grounded . 
  ethnic russians must feel at home if the other countries follow the same rules as their motherland . 
  edit : grammar, 
  i 'm ethnically russian living in estonia and i do n't think russian language has to be state language . 
  estonian language is extremely small and on the verge of disappearing , the state has not only the right but also obligation to preserve it . 
  everyone learning one language in a country is nothing extraordinary in this world , actually quite the opposite , its what majority of states demand ( including russia , google putins speech on minorities in russia ) . 
  it is so ironic that these racist are totally oblivious to the fact that they themselves are true scum of the earth . 
  it boggles all logic how they feel superior to any living being at all . 
  so you saying it would be fine to be in the office with hitler portrait in israel ? 
  you seem to be right in the same mindset as this old fart who has no sense of decensy . 
  he makes very important points on turkey and on greece . 
  but by the sound of applause , seems like he does n't have much support . 
  if thats so , we are fucked . 
  thats rather relative . 
  i got most of my news from twitter and reddit . 
  support for joining russia was very low before the war in crimea too . 
  things can change if you polarise population drastically . 
  it might not always be about strategically important land , but about ideology , power etc. 
  above all putin is interested in sustaining his regime and as we saw the crimea was major win for him at home not because of strategic position , but because he united `` russian '' people . 
  and since then he has been pushing for the idea of `` russian world '' . 
  in other words , anywhere where there are russians needs to be re-united with russia . 
  the fall of ussr was the biggest catastrophe of 20th century after all , according to putin . 
  it has calmed down drastically , but during the crimean annexation most of the people i knew were genuinely worried . 
  russia is more than hundred times larger than us when it comes to population . 
  so yeah , without alliance we have no chance . 
  still , like some guy there said , who will protect you if you are not willing to protect yourself . 
  comparison would be to have a german guy living in israel giving interview with straight face with little hitler portrait in the background . 
  our english is pretty good . 
  thank you . 
  ( except in narva , 
  it does n't matter if its true or not . 
  putin will just repeat it until it sticks somewhere . 
  they did a great job at propaganda with ukraine , they 'll use the same weapon on turkey , or whoever is the next `` enemy '' . 
  the whole point is that the only way to fight the corruption is to orient towards west . 
  russia being corrupt as fuck and leadership thriving in that environment , cultivating it , seem to want to hold other countries at their level and not let them change . 
  and now , thanks to occupation , large amount of people will have to live in the corruption soup for as long as they are part of russia . 
  does n't mean you ca n't make sarcastic comments towards those who support the landgrab , does it . 
  i think this message was for people who believe the annexation was somewhat justified . 
  it clearly landed in the right place , as you are pretty active . 
  i do n't know why you assumed op meant whole population . 
  army surrendered because kiev was in chaos . 
  instead of helping russia ( the `` brotherly '' state ) came in and beat the victim lying on the ground . 
  you are right , i kind of missed that `` special '' thing . 
  if only real life was like hollywood and martial arts had anything to do with police work . 
  read the article  after traveling to the russian capital on thursday , french president francois hollande said he had agreed with his counterpart vladimir putin that these attacks would only hit islamic state and ** similar jihadi groups ** in syria . 
  i doubt `` massive immigration '' is already reflecting in gdp . 
  i would expect it be a burden as of now actually , maybe later it 'll pay off . 
  say what you will , but immigrants have been always a welcome sight for business . 
  in short term at least , 
  it 's just pretty pathetic that someone from outside has to come and `` save '' us , be it putin or obama , where both have their own agenda at play ( which for us are just lesser evil than isis at the moment , but in a long run could bring bigger problems ) . 
  turkey one of the most unfriendly places for journalists . 
  go look up the definition of autocrat . 
  putin and erdogan , both are autocrats ( difference is putin have reached further ) . 
  there 's not much democracy if you eliminate journalism , critics , opposition and control media - elections in these conditions is a joke . 
  putin getting to taste some of his own medicine . 
  it 's entertaining to see two autocratic egomaniacs go at each other . 
  i have n't seen anything productive happening for years , so i do n't know what counter-productive actions are we afraid of . 
  let 's hope the negotiations will bring some good though , but i 'm pretty skeptical that they will . 
  funny part is , none of the european leaders seem to be frustrated . 
  we have to wait for a lefty us president to open his mouth . 
  per capita we have more than russia . 
  if we look at the past few years in europe , all we 've been doing is searching for the scapegoat as soon as some crisis arises . 
  it 's either greece , or merkel , or eastern europe , belgium , turkey , and of course always us for some people . 
  i mean , there are some truths to those , but many tend to go to the extremes and blame everything on one thing . 
  you are definitely right , we have much in common , as i too would love to see good relationship between us .

  virtually the whole middle east is filled with dictators and a radical religion , but it 's still beneficial to keep close the ones who agree to fight your main enemies alongside you no matter their reasons . 
  wholly possible , but would n't op 's point still apply if you replace `` refugee '' with '' [ muslim ] immigrant '' ? 
  well if you 're really cheap and you need to drive your car ( or bus ) to valka to buy even cheaper alcohol , then there is a reason . 
  can you even cross the gulf sober ? 
   basically northern estonia to be fair , finland 's population surpassed estonia 's only somewhere around the [ livonian war ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/livonian_war ) .

   hernekeitto , hernekeitto * hernesupp * and * klimbisupp * are common here as well .

  some of the others seem very similar to our stew-like dishes as well . 
  chance , next to other remains , strategic possible locations etc. 
  classic case for a dictatorship pretending to be a democracy . 
  good gravel roads , not much to do in the countryside but rally , drink , and go to saunas .

  they speak drunk estonian . 
  so this post intentionally combined female ministers of defense as if it tried to say something . 
  dude , you had to do way too much to get banned from r/russsia . 
  you know there are easier ways to get banned without going so over the line . 
  since when is russia not red ? 
  i recently found out that * ait\u00e4h * ( `` thank you '' ) is a combination of two words . 
  in dialects and some other contexts you can still hear the word * aituma * or * ait\u00fcma * , which itself comes from * aita * ( `` help '' ) and * jumal * ( `` god '' ) . 
  so `` thank you '' in estonian really means `` god help '' . 
  we call them `` onion domes '' ( * sibulakuplid * ) . 
  `` onions '' ( * sibul * ) is also a slang word for russians , which may or may not have a negative meaning since it most likely comes from older immigrants , the russian old believers , who are known to sell onions in a [ tied-together way ] ( http://www.sibulatee.ee/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/6582955331.jpg ) . 
  i think it would be a bit much to go into regional words every time . 
  in southern estonian `` apple '' is * ubin * instead of * \u00f5un * , but i 'm not really expecting them to notice such things every time . 
  you mis-spelled `` concerned people fighting against fascism '' . 
   or it 's just a middle finger to russia . 
  oh come on , of course it is . 
  those ribbons are everywhere in tallinn as well . 
  it 's like these people are still living in the soviet union ... 
  which may not be logical , but at least understandable . 
  but to actually think a name of the country is a 100 % guarantee of a country 's political system ... 
  most countries with the name `` democratic '' in their names definitely are n't democratic . 
  probably just liberalism in general . 
  but i doubt any person can be labeled with one general ideology as we usually follow different ideologies in different aspects of life . 
  [ the horseshoe theory ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/horseshoe_theory ) .

  am i denying that ? 
  what you need to understand is that this state does not have one society , but two . 
  yes . 
  i do n't want to be looked down upon because certain immigrants screw our statistics up so much . 
  jesus , how exactly ? 
  yeah people just do n't seem to get this .

  five decades of soviet-imposed harsh propaganda . 
  person nr 84 , who forgets what the forced-upon socialist era was like . 
  does it really take so little time after the dissolution of the ussr and the socialist bloc that people forget what it was really like ? 
  50 years of soviet-imposed harsh propaganda . 
  it 's not like the people who grew up in it will ever change . 
  quite definitely so . 
   eesti can not into nordic . 
  is this meme really funny to some people then ? 
   does n't matter what is the excuse wow . 
  50 years of harsh occupation and finally independence and this is how the uneducated youth of the west treats us . 
  it 's not just a joke , it seems many people do think exactly this way . 
  rather self-righteous and they do n't understand why we are so much behind in many social and economic aspects . 
  and the main reason the eastern europeans are n't is the effect of a foreign-imposed totalitarian dictatorship . 
   why does support dwindle as you movie east ? 
  50 years of harsh propaganda by soviet-imposed totalitarian dictatorships . 
  we 've never really been very religious . 
  christianity was forced upon us by invaders , so why believe this bullshit . 
  because someone told you so ? 
  yeah , not good enough . 
  you do understand that unlike for bigger countries our culture has actually been strongly suppressed and it barely survived ? 
  being opposed to multiculturalism has so many layers that by the choice of definition you could say that either everyone or nobody is against it . 
   i also know some estonian nationalists who just hate the russian minorities and see them as the invaders , even though they 've lived in estonia for their whole lives jesus christ , people invade your country , repress your people , and glorify the invaders and your supposed to treat them like your fellow countrymen ??? 
  the folks like you , seriously ... 
  your hand-picked definition of nationalism . 
  do n't bullshit us here !, 
  that 's a social issue rather distant from culture . 
  political nationalism is a very different thing though . 
  there are rather few political nationalists here . 
  it 's rather that parties from liberals to conservatives to politically nationalists could be considered nationalists . 
  y u so unintelligent though ? 
  no , you insult a country based on lacking knowledge and think we 'll be ok with the `` criticism '' ? 
  jesus , the folks like you ...  with good reason lol  just the emotionless , faceless country . 
  do you actually claim to be a normal , unbiased person ? 
  holy fuck , do people as unintelligent as you really exist ? 
  again , quite high and mighty to blame us for the effects of five decades of soviet occupation . 
  sorry naive person , estonia 's elderly was raised by a harsh totalitarian dictatorship and propaganda . 
  it will take time for them to change - in fact they wo n't and it will take time for them to die off . 
  it 's rather high and mighty coming from you to say such things if our culture is strongly related to the other nordic countries and we did n't choose the soviet regime ourselves . 
  plus , ethnic russian minority also influences our statistics a lot as their views are usually very different than that of estonians .

  us has no real first timers alive , everyone is simply a citizen . 
  in europe things are a tiny bit complicated and you ca n't simply do away with thousands of years of history . 
  there is a heavy percentage of citizens who also have their origins in that place for hundreds or even thousands of years by some bloodline . 
  old habits and traditions are slow to fade away and you are asking the near impossible . 
  again us had a very different start . 
  integration services are horrible , otherwise integration would be successful . 
  there are no people that can not be integrated even if they do n't want to . 
  integration is a natural process and is not something you can fight if the host country is open to having you . 
  _______________________________________________________________________________________ nope , nope no no no and no . 
  this is the rose tinted glasses way of integration , this is the disney movie integration . 
  this is the children pg13 integration . 
  you are basically saying `` it simply happens '' . 
  estonia has had a culturally different community for ages . 
  we are a good `` testtube '' of a country with a large minority . 
  estonian russians and estonians still live in two different worlds . 
  different tv channels , different languages , you can even tell apart different clothe styles and hairstyles that russian kids have and estonian kids have . 
  yes there are free state ( and thereby tax funded ) russian language schools that also teach estonian heavily and yes there are all kinds of projects done on media landscape or `` cooperative '' type of projects . 
  problem is they do n't work . 
  if they feel comfortable ( as most russians do feel ) they do n't see a need to change anything , they have russian schools , russian friends , russian tv channels , all state sites have russian versions etc etc. 
  they do n't need to integrate at all . 
  the society has already changed enough to accompany them and not the other way around as they forcefully became apart of estonian society . 
  obviously not their fault at all , just as estonians were deported to siberian regions , they were semi-forcefully deported to estonia ( some came as families with the army to keep locals under a solid foot ) . 
  in siberia also estonian villages formed and they created their own culture sphere trying to keep it alive . 
  point being its idiotic to expect a nation to basically handfeed and cart every single individual to force them to integrate . 
  if they do n't really want to integrate they wo n't , simple as that . 
  integration is a two way process . 
  what is `` positive '' at least in estonia is that a very slow process is bringing russian estonians away from the russian federation citizens so at least they are their own culture group besides actual russians and estonians . 
  also a small percentage do get integrated toward estonian averages but it will still take decades to get anywhere . 
  also as a disclaimer i must say i am not xenophobic , russian estonians have every right to have their space , just as americans say `` i might not agree with them but i will defend their rights with them '' but the willy-nilly integration that you picture is not real , its in la-la land . 
  it is not that black and white and simple . 
  living in a country with a forcefully relocated minority of 30 % is not something you want in a country . 
  i mean the reason for having a country is that people share a basic common view so they can co-exist . 
  if you have quite different views about how things should be run then ... its hard to legislate such a country . 
  this is a long known anomaly of colonies . 
  they usually keep some of the culture/traditions alive better than mainland . 
  mostly it has to do with a smaller community and having to keep to what they know from the past ( as they lost a direct contact to the trends and have to slowly restart from where they left off ) . 
  so when england kind of went on to their natural path of development us kept the culture of when most of the colonists went to the new land and as the community was initially smaller it diverged from the `` main '' `` cultural development '' . 
  something that sort , i am sure some professor would explain it a lot better . 
  also language usually is quite true to written from but people get `` lazy '' in pronouncing and shorter words develop so over time some of the spoken language changes and the written form lags behind . 
  a good example is how wednesday was said fully with even the `` silent d '' but people simply blurred out `` wensdi '' and after a while the easier form spread . 
  this also expands to proto languages/lingusitics of very basic words like mother , home , foot , food , hand , walk , water , me , you etc. 
  how these words are down to the bare minimum in most languages in terms of vowels as they have been used so heavily over centuries that we basically sound like cavemen ( perhaps even cavemen used similar sounds for first words ) . 
  like the word `` me '' is very easy to say , simply put your lips together and blow a little air from your throat . 
  also a lot of languages have a very easy word for `` me '' .

  well the only serious disadvantage is that women are weaker as they lacked the testosterone to build up muscle and general mass . 
  in a mixed unit women would not be able to perform all the actions needed , for example evacing probably heavier members , taking over squad positions that require lifting extra equipment for a prolonged time etc etc. 
  they would in general bring the unit down as the weakest member sets the pace of a task force . 
  another big problem at least how estonia built up their defense force is that we are the modern day freaking heavy knights and i do n't mean it in a good way . 
  we carry so much freaking equipment with us that we are like walking tanks in terms of pace and needed endurance . 
  i mean our full set of equipment weighs 31,6 kg , now add to that a battle rifle , ammo , food , water and any extra guns a squad will have like rocket launchers , machine guns ( their ammo that usually gets distributed around ) . 
  in wartime it should help us survive and be flexible in terms of having all the equipment with us but in reality it puts a lot of strain on troops having to mostly carry everything with them . 
  i saw smaller guys heavily challenged by this and on average women are obviously more akin to smaller frame sizes . 
  again i am not saying women could n't do it but on average they would be the weaker links in units . 
  also the way it is built up women who volunteer for service have basically a `` kids happy meal version '' service , they usually serve less time ( unless they want to continue , career reasons for ex ) and they have easier requirements for physical tests etc etc. 
  so they kind of give a facade of equality but in reality a natural gender gap is still there . 
  we can try to force equality a much as we want but the reality is men are just on average stronger and in physical tasks perform better . 
  just how nature built us up , more muscle mass , less body fat , higher mass and height etc. 
  the army so far has built their realistic standards on average males so for true equality standards would have to be lowered ( from a males perspective ) and standardized for everyone . 
  i do n't see that happening any time soon but the current way of willy nillying `` equal service '' idea would not work as simply . 
  a lot more changes would need to take place or the men would turn into extra pack mules and service providers having to somehow give 150 % . 
  edit : just to clarify i am not trying to be sexist , if it somehow worked i would ( of ) loved to have a feminine side in the army unit . 
  an all boys club during service got boring after a while . 
  its the 21 century pandoras box ai n't it ? 
  we want our cultures to stand the test of time but also we would like to get onto the global earth alliance type of deal where everyone is happy living together , no matter if you 're black or white . 
  we want the cake and eat it . 
  i do have a new hobby when i spot a black person . 
  i do n't stare at him or her but i stare at the slightly awestruck estonians who spot that black person . 
  nothing racist about it , its just like when during soviet times people were awestruck about jeans and bananas as society kind of lagged behind , or so i 've heard . 
  i always feel second hand embarrassment as i notice how the black person notices of people noticing him/her . 
  edit : just to clarify i do know refugees should n't be all categorized as `` black '' but if any , they obviously stand out the most in a society where 99,9 % are white . 
  i have felt the same when i lived in a 99,9 % non white country , you kind of stand out in both situations . 
  well i do get this . 
  kind of a stereotype . 
  : ) it is however a `` estonian dream '' principle to work in the city and have a rural house/home on the outskirts of a bigger city for the peace and quiet , also nature . 
  so actually the president is living how many estonians would like to . 
  it is probably a cultural thing that you associate going to the forest somehow as a lower action to lets say playing golf but i find it awesome . 
  ilves in an old man after all and he seemingly goes to pick mushrooms , president or not . 
  i think the stigma is how the news was reported at all , in some states it would of probably just been left at `` president is sick , cause unknown '' or something similar ( if reported at all as it is n't that severe ) while no one really cared and the full reasoning was published here . 
  russia for example holds the presidents health under closed wraps so no one could even think putin is sick at all . 
  in before `` russia kidnaps 100 fence builders because obvious estonian nato spies '', 
  just read an estonian blog post that discussed the etymology of the word `` linn '' . 
  while it is intertwined with the meaning of linnus ( fortress ) the origin seems to be more interesting , perhaps predating fortresses themselves . 
  apparently it used to be `` lidn or litn or lind '' . 
  the first chronic used names like `` somelinde '' or `` agelinde '' to describe fortress names . 
  also a common idea was to say `` city/fortress place '' or `` linna/linnuse ase '' or apparently a merger of these words `` litnanas\u00f5n , lidnanas\u00f5n '' . 
  `` as\u00f5n '' used to be the old way of saying `` ase '' . 
  this is how the battle of lyndanisse got its name . 
  basically `` battle of city/fort place '' he or she also theorizes that it could be an old ritual name litha that gathered people around certain settlements that named their centers as `` lithnas/lidna/lidn '' .

  does that mean wales is actually ooales ?

  why does it take two weeks to order something from amazon in the eu ? 
  where is our newegg equivalent ? 
  where are our equivalents to intel , ms , google etc ? 
  we do n't have them . 
  anything that hurts these companies means that they 're less likely to do anything with smaller countries . 
  it took until ** 2016 ** before you could sell apps on the android appstore . 
  it took until around 2011-2012 to actually get paypal . 
  so please , consider what the online market in europe is like , not just germany . 
  a fine because of yelp . 
   the action came after a seven-year long investigation prompted by scores of complaints from rivals such as u.s. consumer review website yelp ( yelp.n ) considering that it is yelp that was mentioned first in this list i 'm not so sure it 's good at all . 
  i think the issue is language . 
  english is a language that many know and moving there would settle the language issue easily , but that 's not the case when you 're moving elsewhere . 
  this needs to be addressed right now before it becomes an even bigger problem . 
   most legal systems have different ways to deal with dealing with people who are not in a mental state to manage their lives . 
  do they ? 
  because to me it seems like most of them just involuntarily commit them based on one or two psychiatrists ' word and then reevaluate later with little accountability on the psychiatrists . 
  it does n't help that you generally get less rights as a mental health patient that 's committed than a criminal in prison . 
   the two are interlinked in this case is all . 
  it reads to me more like a pro life psychiatrist found what the girl was doing unacceptable and abused their power because psychiatrists in these cases are n't really held accountable . 
  meanwhile the girl likely found it to be a very traumatic experience . 
  and meanwhile a girl was forcefully imprisoned for several days while thinking otherwise . 
  you have less rights in psychiatric hospitals than you have in prison . 
   a consultant psychiatrist , on whose evidence she was detained , said a termination was `` not the solution for all the child 's problems at this stage . ''  the girl 's guardian ad litem -- a person who supports children to have their voices heard in legal proceedings and makes an assessment -- employed a second consultant psychiatrist . 
   a district court judge then discharged the order detaining the young girl on the grounds that the child no longer had a mental health disorder in accordance with section 3 of the mental health act . 
  it 's understood that the child had been detained several days earlier . 
  sounds to me more like a psychiatrist does n't like abortions and was abusing their power . 
  involuntary commitment is no joke , especially when it is done to somebody for several days on a lie . 
   sixty-nine percent of participants perceived at least one hospitalization as traumatic or extremely distressing . 
  perceived trauma was more common among females than males and homemakers compared with full-time workers . 
  trauma perception was not associated with treatment-seeking or time in treatment . 
  [ source ] ( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc4039016/ ) there have been a bunch of other studies like this too . 
  even a few days of involuntary commitment can cause ptsd . 
  hell , you could just google it and you would run into forum posts and reddit threads where you could ask a person directly about it who feels that way . 
  so while you might think that it worked as it was supposed to , to me the entire thing sounds like massive abuse . 
  makes me wonder if that girl will ever trust a mental health worker again . 
  i do n't think this is the case . 
  in estonia i 've heard of quite a bit of infrastructure being built with this type of money . 
  this is somewhat related : back when the word `` owned '' was very popular in online games estonians used it as well . 
  because `` own '' is pronounced very similarly to '' \u00f5un '' ( apple ) in estonian sometimes in online games estonians would say '' \u00f5unad '' ( apples ) instead . 
   so they are n't dependent on the compensation then ? 
  they could choose to leave anytime and choose to be a tax haven if market access does n't matter ? 
  we 're talking about companies here . 
  some companies will be attracted to the low taxes . 
  some of them do n't care about the market access . 
  why do you think small nations outside of the eu are tax havens ? 
  they do n't have access to the single market . 
   which happens in every single country , big or small . 
  yes , but this means that in a country where there is less capital you 're less likely to see businesses like this start up . 
  if a person has capital to start the business then it does n't matter if the bank does or does not give them a loan . 
  so no , `` capital is not the problem '' is not true . 
  it can be a problem . 
   they 're selling it , they do n't have a gun pointed to their head when they sign the contract . 
  yes , but it 's not the country that 's selling it . 
  it 's an individual or a group . 
  their best interests do n't align with the best interests of a country in this kind of a situation . 
   banks are ready to lend to anybody in any country as long as proof of returns can be provided . 
  so capital is not the problem . 
  and if you 're starting a business this does n't always work . 
  not every business is successful , so banks do not give out loans in many cases . 
   the money from the acquisition go to the previous owner , assuming he 's a local , this is good for the economy . 
  yes , they get pennies on the dollar of what it 'll be worth down the line . 
  and this absolutely has something to do with this situation . 
  if the companies that start with new and innovative stuff get bought up when they 're small or only emerging then they ca n't export that product or technology from the country in the same way . 
  yeah , like not having capital and the few businesses that do start here just get bought up . 
  i 'm not 100 % sure that everyone is better off in the long run . 
  with urbanization big cities also drag up rural areas but at the end of the day the rural areas get more and more screwed by it . 
  i think it 's pretty hard to tell that this will not happen between richer and poorer countries in the eu . 
  brain drain is already going on . 
  if all the new companies tend towards the big and richer countries then the rest might have their quality of life standards increase slightly but they 'd be falling behind further compared to the bigger countries . 
  the other thing is that even if a company starts in a smaller or poorer country it usually seems to just get bought up by a bigger and richer country 's business . 
  not necessarily . 
  even if these countries were n't part of the single market they would be doing the same to get investment from companies . 
  they just would n't be as attractive . 
  but it 's not purely on the tax revenue from companies directly . 
  somewhat , yes , but some companies do do their business in countries like that due to the cheaper taxes , but the market access is n't as important for them . 
  people have an issue with the fact that without low taxes there 's little reason for a company to set up shop in a small or poor country . 
  small and poor countries would basically feel something akin to what rural areas felt and feel compared to big cities . 
  the jobs start disappearing and the area becomes poorer . 
   if that corporation produces in the second country ( with all that population ) , that country has to pay for all the infrastructure and is n't getting any of that corporation 's money as compensation how about all the jobs this provides and thus the taxes on the salaries ? 
  having reasonable jobs in a country can be more important than just government revenue . 
  i think this would be the reasonable approach here as well . 
  but that makes it much much worse . 
  it would basically create a similar situation you see of rural areas vs big cities . 
  and as we know the rural areas got and are getting completely screwed . 
   you mean countries that actually provide the infrastructure and educated workforce would get the tax money ? 
  how is this bad ?? 
  if a big company has equal taxation in germany and greece and equal opportunity for employees then the companies should almost always choose germany because there are more people and businesses in germany . 
  this means it 's a bigger more easily accessible market . 
  it also means it 's easier to so business with other companies since there are more in germany . 
  there would be little reason to pick greece there and thus germany will keep powering ahead with their economy while the smaller countries lag behind . 
  just look at the situation in a country between cities and rural areas . 
  that 's basically what would happen under the same taxation rules between countries . 
  this . 
  exactly this . 
  they would basically be completely dependent on the eu at that point . 
  yes , and i explained why it 's not a useful thing to look at for laymen . 
  his work does n't produce more value , it 's just valued more . 
  there 's a distinction when you talk about it in laymen 's terms . 
  a normal person thinks of productivity going up as people being more efficient at making something or doing something rather than being valued higher . 
  the issue with being something being valued higher is that if you compare two different economies ( which you do when you compare countries ) then the wealthier economy is going to be more productive purely because they 're wealthier .

   the scots voted to stay . 
  the circumstances have changed . 
  took him a while , though , he 's ( well , `` his '' twitter feed is ) usually much quicker with these things , especially if they concern western countries . 
  it 's unknown if he did it on his own initiative , or had to clear it with his bosses first . 
  the delay would indicate latter . 
  there 's a hint , though , that it _ might _ have been himself , as the deputy chair of russian senate 's defense and security committee ( a `` former '' gru man himself ) went on record just days later saying `` snowden did share intelligence '' . 
  might 've been a warning to behave in the future . 
   satire in the uk now writes itself and our comedians will never match it . 
  dunno , last two episodes of dead ringers have been point on - `` you 're michael gove ! '', 
   a large walled road or , y' know , a tunnel . 
  it 's not about the republic of ireland ( that matter was settled nearly a century ago ) , it 's about northern ireland . 
   eu extents the deadline with a year or so . 
  i doubt that 's necessary , two years is plenty of time . 
  it 's not only uk 's negotiating position with eu that will hurt , they 'll also need to renegotiate decades ' worth of treaties with third parties . 
  uk will have to do it from a weaker position , w/o eu behind them , and appearing indecisive this early in the process does n't do them any good . 
  the deal is work in progress . 
  hundreds of people have worked on it for years , and will likely continue to do so for years to come . 
  unless you want them to update a wiki daily , there 's not much to make public before the deal has been hammered out . 
  proportionally ( liechtenstein is fucking tiny ) it 'd mean what , 125k eu immigrants to uk per year ? 
  to date ( iirc ) that amount has only been exceeded in 2014 & 2015 . 
  you want to trolley ? 
  here ? 
  last week someone called uk an `` offshore austria '' - rump of a once-great empire . 
  those are _ informal _ informal talks , not _ formal _ informal talks . 
  farage was instrumental in that his demagoguery fed into creating an environment of hysteria in which said mentally ill neonazi thought it both necessary and justified to take the action he took . 
  three cod wars and one euro cup .

  nah , that takes the rebate into account . 
  gove and johnson are columnists . 
  it 's their _ job _ to come up with flashy ideas and simple solutions to complex problems on a weekly basis , with no consideration for practicality or applicability thereof . 
  the scots had a plan . 
  shows how ignorant i am about british democracy , too . 
  i would n't have thought they 'd limit their pool of candidates that way . 
  and -- no chance of a technocratic government ? 
  dunno , the lack of term limits and clear areas of responsibility throws me off in this case . 
  stop that !, 
  it 's silly !, 
  this may come as a surprise to you , but having stood for election is n't a requirement for a position in the cabinet . 
   because prime ministers were elected . 
  prime ministers were voted into parliament by the public . 
  so how many votes did dave get ... about 35k , no ? 
   harriet harman , the former leader of the uk labor party and one of the most respected left wing and pro eu politicians , was on a bbc political show several weeks ago . 
  she did n't even recognize the presidents of the eu - the most powerful men in the eu , the leaders creating around 50 % of uk 's laws and holding offices supreme to uk 's highest court !, 
  then she 's an uninformed numpty , no matter the qualifications . 
  he was appointed by the elected government . 
  representative democracy , how does it work ? 
  not after the divorce . 
  tbh , i doubt many even knew about the new agreement . 
  as the quotes stem from leave materials , i trust you do n't mind if i ask for their sources ? 
   cameron renegotiated and not much changed . 
  the february deal was to come in power after remain vote . 
  as the vote went for leave , the deal is off the table again . 
  he 's also said that us has other priorities right now , so a new trade deal with uk would have to wait at the back of the line . 
   i understand not all our muslim immigrants come from the eu . 
  yes , majority come from commonwealth -- pakistan & bangladesh alone cover more than 50 % of uk 's muslim population . 
   most people actually want free trade with the eu and nothing to change . 
  except freedom of movement . 
  but even now , the eu seems completely unwilling to compromise on this policy . 
  if you guys get a special deal , everyone else will also want one . 
  russia _ has _ signed up to banning air-dropped incendiary weapons , however . 
  the bombs on that su-34 in this video were \u0420\u0411\u041a-250 \u0417\u0410\u0411-2 ,5 \u041c : unguided 250kg cluster bombs with 2,5 kg incendiary submunitions . 
  quite apart from the _ cluster _ and _ indendiary _ bits , was n't it not that long ago that russia denied using _ unguided _ bombs ? 
  nah , this is worse . 
  with an election , at least you get an automatic do-over in a few years . 
  lol that guy is referring to ldpr as opposition . 
  russians became a majority in crimea later than albanians did in kosovo . 
  they were always free to move back to russia . 
  i 'm reasoning that for any process of independence to be legal , it would have to have been arranged between `` the people of crimea '' and ukrainian government . 
  for the transfer of territory to be legal , it would have to be arranged between russia and ukraine . 
  the annexation of crimea was illegal because at no point in the process was ukraine even consulted . 
  instead , russian forces occupied the crimean parliament , set up a puppet government and had them declare a referendum . 
  when i steal your phone , does `` but the phone wanted it this way '' sound like an acceptable argument ? 
  thing is , it 's _ both _ . 
  considering how often you see `` and then some guys in black showed up and started fighting '' in those narratives from euro2016 , i 'm starting to suspect a conspiracy . 
  warsaw 1988 as well . 
  not about `` are you '' but `` were you '' , imho . 
   while evolution is a theory , it is a proven theory and therefore most certainly should be taught as a fact . 
  wrong . 
  evolution is a fact . 
  the theory of evolution , an attempt to explain said fact , is a theory . 
  but ... but ... how are the religions to survive without indoctrination ? 
   religion has to accept scientific progress . 
  religion has to accept facts . 
  it 's easier to be exploited by an ideology if said ideology tells you you 'll be rewarded in the afterlife for doing so . 
   `` religion is the sigh of the oppressed creature , the heart of a heartless world , and the soul of soulless conditions . 
  it is the opium of the people . '', 
  because religions are . 
   i get hungry because the human body needs food to survive . 
  i get thirsty because i need water to survive . 
  i have a sex drive because humans need to reproduce to survive . 
  that 's bullshit , and you know it . 
  first two cases are about survival of an individual , the third one is n't . 
  evolution does n't give a flying fuck whether two specific people going at it results in babies or not . 
  it 's about _ populations _ and survival thereof , by having enough offspring reach sexual maturity to reproduce themselves . 
  having extra people in the older generation who have no children themselves to look after others ' is a true and tried evolutionary tactic to give the offspring of a population a better chance of survival . 
  homosexuality is , i suspect , nature 's way to provide those people w/o having to switch off their sexual drive completely as is the case with many other species . 
  nah , most of those are cultural as well . 
   basic knowledge of sex and human reproduction makes this obvious . 
  oh , please , _ please _ enlighten us , 
  ouch ...

  because you 're a guy who likes cute girls more ? 
  also , sweden and russia are not neighbours , unless you meant they 're neighbours of finland ... 
  hmm , yes , * so many * ukrainian refugees as well more seriously , can you really not believe that some people actually liked those acts ? 
  old people like cute yet decently old gentlemen who magically stand on a space rock on stage and say crimea should be a part of ukraine . 
  i feel like the people who still think eurovision is non-political have either never seen it before or are just too young to understand it, 
  i know right , just look at [ germany ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-z7pkopp9s ), 
  yeah , you 're not wrong , but you 're telling this to a native estonian right now . . ? 
  also , they 're watching russian tv channels because until very lately , there was no good local tv channel in russian and quite a large percentage of the population does n't speak estonian, 
  rt , the main english speaking russian news outlet , was saying it was rigged . 
  . . you delete your comment every time someone downvotes it , or replies to it ? 
  nice . 
  you 're thinking of a steam sauna . 
  that 's a turkish invention from what i know . 
  that 's why you have . . 
  i do n't know what the fuck you call them in english , but basically little foam thingies you can sit on .

  hardcore people lean their whole back against the wall . 
  alternatively , we sit on a towel . 
  it 's way better over here . 
  i actually enjoy it . 
  had some last night because i was sick and shit tired and could n't bear to face the stack of dirty dishes . 
  only in shameful southern saunas . 
  how we heat is we make a big fucking stove and put our fresh chopped wood in it . 
  you shame your ancestors . 
  ( and holy shit , chill the fuck out , we 're all joking ), 
  european russians yes , people in st petersburg and moscow are pretty white . 
  you 're forgetting how big russia is , though . 
   among the smallest you sound like you 're picking a fight, 
  ` facts ' with 0 evidence given behind them ? 
   estonians trying to fight german occupation , you serious ? 
  yes ? 
  lmao i understand that it does n't fit with your ` evil estonians ' world view , but we did n't want to be under any occupation . 
  the germans were ` better ' to us yes but nobody still wanted to be forced to be a part of the war or a part of another country again , and the only reason kl and ok were working with the germans was the growing fear of communism . 
  ever heard of a little thing called the deportation of 1941 ? 
  we were entirely right to fear the return of the soviets , because the same thing happened in 49 . and again - few percent of the men of omakaitse were taking part in deliberate acts against minorities , okay , but obviously they were punished for it if there was evidence . 
  i 'm not going to even comment on your hilariously bad sourcing from wikipedia, 
  well . . we no longer have practically any jews after all the war and occupation , so no cities . 
  the germans and soviets did a pretty good job ` cleaning house ' . 
  you never occupied us , sweden is n't 2 steps from russia , and sweden 's meme weaponry is the most advanced in the entire world - only australia and currently germany with / r/the _ schulz might be able to compete, 
  you fucks stole our flag , we ai n't coming back * runs in the approximate direction of / r/sweden *, 
  fuck , all this work for nothing :p, 
  but where 's the snow ? 
  / r/waifuism would like to have a word, 
  the appendix actually has an use - if you have the stomach flu or anything similar , your good gut flora goes to hide out in the appendix . 
  no idea if this was the original purpose of it , though . 
  i think a better translation ( but one that kinda loses/worsens the wordplay ) would be something along the lines of ` who gives a shit about this ', 
  that would imply that we were legally a part of the soviet union , which numerous people here disagree with/believe to be incorrect ( not trying to imply how i feel about the matter ) . 
  a country literally at war managed , i think you 'll be fine, 
  honestly i started rooting for them because they were a shining example of classic eurovision silliness of the late 00s . 
  over here they were pretty well known artists , and i think one was actually a songwriter . 
  ` you 're from australia ??? ', 
  this from a small kid from a swiss international school , while we were in the middle of germany . 
  yes , kid , we came to this european competition all the way from australia . 
  ( to be fair eurovision had n't invited them over yet either ), 
  i mean , i think you 'd have a bit of bias as well towards a country that has occupied you three times in the last 150 years , and which still has a sizeable ( 20 % or so ) minority of people in your country who do n't speak the local language and do not attempt to integrate with local society whatsoever . 
  i am personally of a very open mindset towards people of all origins , but it does make me a bit bitter to see people who have been born and lived their entire lives here ( and often even have citizenship ) , yet speak less of the language than people who have been here for two-three years . 
  i 'd say we 're all quite anti-russian , but i really do n't think you can fault us for that considering history ... 
  the current one is practically irrelevant - he 's a successful businessman and participates in events only when he has to . 
  with the previous president , the lady our president was first married to took it quite seriously and kinda made `` first ladying '' her main job ( patronage , appearing at public events , that sort of deal ) , but eventually they divorced . 
  she is now doing tv shows and weird shit like that , and the president remarried to a latvian lady , who again is pretty successful in her profession and mostly participated in only the events she was required to be present at . 
  i was 4 years old and i needed to make my first username - apparently r was my favourite letter at the time - i went 1234 , then decided that 's too boring and swapped the places of 3 and 4 it kinda stuck ever since , though i 've recently started to forgo it, 
  i play , you 're not wrong about it being stupid :d, 
  +1 , i have a cube and it 's the best thing i 've gotten from china . 
  small and quiet enough to not really draw any attention , and it keeps me on task relatively well . 
  yeah , really big among the kid crowd here . 
  my mum is a teacher and she complains they sound like bees . 
  something has to be big for my local tiny bookstore to be carrying it . 
  it 's a bit of plastic that houses some ball bearings , and you spin it around . 
  kids seem to have made up different assorted ways to mess with it - try to get it to spin as long as possible from one push , spin several at once , etc. 
  it started off as a ` fidget toy ' , to help people with adhd/other people who have a compulsion to constantly do something with their hands sit still and not mess about . 
  it 's also helpful for autistic people , to ` stim ' - do a repeated motion that tends to calm them . 
  recently they started being mass produced because the patent on them expired , and now middle schoolers found out they exist . 
  i 'm someone with concentration problems as well as a tendency to pick on my skin , and i own a fidget cube ( similar idea , but it has more different things attached to it to mess with - a rolly ball , a joystick to push around and press down , some little clicky buttons and a switch to click back and forth , etc ) . 
  it 's the best shitty chinese purchase i 've made ( officially it 's an illegal replica but i 'm poor ) , it keeps my hands away from myself really well and helps me settle down and focus on what i need to . 
  trust me , you did n't miss out on much . 
  the book , at least the english version , was such trash in my opinion - it was just outright poorly written . 
  the topic is naturally very important , but the author had no idea what he was doing . 
  that was one of the options i had in mind , yeah - the other one would be [ ta lendab mesipuu poole ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ikqno18zvc ) . 
  i do n't have anything against it per se , but we have quite a few better options ( in the sense that we 'd all probably identify more with them ) . 
  if we changed it , we could n't pretend anymore that we did well when finland wins any sports event . 
  no , i said to * her * that ' i did n't connect her name ' . 
  she posted on our national subreddit previously . 
  how are you getting your other things over here ? 
  ( and welcome !, 
  we 'd be happy to help with any other questions over at / r/eesti , if you have n't found us there yet . ), 
  same as most places - for about a month or was very popular , now it 's mostly died down . 
  ... you say chokladbollar as a health trend are ridiculous , but then say that pieces of rye bread fried in oil with garlic added in could be a health trend ? 
  are you okay ? 
  i 'm definitely a post-communist kid , but i have a fucking collection of those fucking plastic chips with pokemon on them . 
  i got a rare one and someone stole it at kindergarten ( or i just lost it , fuck knows tbh ) . 
  still heavily upset by it . 
  op clarified elsewhere that they did mean that, 
  we do , but they 're not supermarkets . 
  there 's several asian specific food stores in tallinn . 
  mid-estonian dialect is still a thing , though you really need to listen to catch it - they have some strange words , ie ` ninuli ' vs ` ninali ' and say some words quite differently . 
  we do also have a word shift between the north and the south , but it 's becoming less prevalent . 
  [ kama ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kama_\\ ( food \\ ) ) , prepared in the traditional manner of dumping it in milk and stirring it up . 
  no thanks . 
  i 've had some delicious kama-based snacks and sweets , though . 
  just not the original form .

  the way i see it , a random tabloid article ( if not even a complete lie ) is enough for germany to block an entire country from visa freedom . 
  while over a million middle-eastern and african migrants are not a problem `` for german public '' . 
  utterly ridiculous . 
  far-right , of course . 
  oh , do n't worry . 
  rest of eu far-rights will find common ground with putin eventually as well , considering their values are very similar . 
  no czechs triggered by ` eastern ' ? 
  i 'm disappointed . 
   the problem and disparity stems from the fact that they 're so isolated . 
  russian information sphere plays an even bigger role here , i 'd say . 
  otherwise , those in tallinn should be already integrated by now , but the situation is not much better than in ida-virumaa , because people still live in a foreign information world , rarely having contact with estonian and even european media , for that matter . 
  did you hit your head somewhere ? 
  how could you possibly read all these things out from my comment ? 
   and therefore , really do n't differ much from russians of russia . 
   and thank god for that . 
  you mean thank putin for that , right ? 
  and soviet union . 
  it 's not better in latvia , though . 
  are n't there like over 100 000 non-citizens unable to vote in riga alone ? 
  statistics seem to confirm that . 
  however , these are still our people we 've lost , who could work in estonia ( we are lacking less-skilled workers ) , who could develop themselves here . 
  that 's why i like the nordic model - sure , having few skills gives you worse job , but it still pays enough to have a decent life . 
  and somebody needs to do the job anyway . 
  one could argue english is an international language that gives access to most of the world , and which primary users , uk and usa are both rather multicultural , international , democratic and free nations . 
  when it comes to russian , well , it 's spoken only in ex-ussr countries , mainly in russia , and the media in that country is largely government-controlled and full of propaganda . 
  unsurprisingly , the people that follow that media are also with very different values from those in the west . 
  and , we of course have all the finno-ugric nations in russia who have lost their identity and are being russified , to compare . 
  so sorry , but i 'm not really willing to switch to russian in hope that we 'll be as fierce as the irish one day , only with a way less useful language . 
  i 'm sorry , but what are you talking about ? 
  there 's no `` region in estonia which does n't have voting right '' . 
  voting rights are given on the basis of citizenship only , and nothing else , not by region , not by nationality etc. 
  sure , that 's right . 
  but the russian citizens of estonia number 100 000 which is very significant . 
  and well , i ca n't really compare estonian election patterns to russian ones . 
  oh , i see there has been a census in 2014 . 
  okay , they have another similar slump in the population , which was a `` total surprise '' for the statistics office , i guess . 
  i forgot about the transnistria , which probably twists the results a bit . 
  do they have a separate census or what ? 
  sure , after stalin 's death , the local moscow-approved commies could decide some things themselves . 
  although whenever they got some ideas moscow did n't like , well , that 's another story . 
  i mean , even in the `` independent '' eastern bloc countries , ussr did n't hesitate to invade ( hungary 1956 , czechoslovakia 1968 , which both were already after stalin 's death ) . 
  just think how much less could they decide inside ussr . 
  lithuania did manage to avoid such a large-scale immigration as estonia and latvia , but how much of it was because of smart local commies , and how much because of other circumstances ( oil shale mining in estonia , latvian industries , baltic ports , kaliningrad next to lithuania , where over a million russians migrated ) , is not clear . 
  eughh , alright , i 'll find some for you . 
  * likelihood to support cohabitation act [ that also legalizes gay partnerships in estonia ] , by [ age and native language ] ( http://www.ut.ee/kristjan.vassil/wp-content/uploads/vanus_keel.jpg ) . 
  red - estonian , blue - russian . 
  from [ this university of tartu research ] ( http://www.ut.ee/kristjan.vassil/?p=735 ) . 
  * [ russian citizens in estonia support putin even more than those in russia ] ( http://maailm.postimees.ee/760680/putin-korjas-eestis-voimsa-haaltesaagi ) - apparently 86 % of russian citizens in estonia supported putin in 2012 elections , while only 64 % of russian citizens in russia did the same . 
  * [ open estonia foundation polling comparing information channels of estonians and russians ] ( http://www.saarpoll.ee/userfiles/file/aef_aruanne__1_.pdf ) most important information channels for estonians : estonian tv , for russians : pbk , rtr ( russian channels ) . 
  note that estonian tv is also available in russian language . 
  most important event in media : ukraine events ( 79 % for ee , 85 % for ru ) , but shooting down malaysia airline was multiple times more important for estonians ( 24 % vs 5 % for russians ) . 
  hmm , i wonder if russian media downplayed it because separatists made a tiny mistake ? 
  you could easily search for yourself in latvia aswell , unfortunately i do n't speak latvian and my russian is not great enought to find trustable polls and researches . 
   i know the situation in estonia is quite different , you have disenfranchised your russian population to the point where large portion of them now live below the poverty line and struggle with problems like alcoholism and drug use . 
  actually , russians are not that much worse off from estonians in living standards . 
  many of the richest businessmen are russians . 
  drug use is certainly a problem that was something that spilled over from russia in 1990s and just spread insanely here due to very heavy concentration of russiains in small geographic area . 
   in latvia the situation is different . 
  not very much , i believe . 
   russians in latvia are part of the society . 
  do you mean the 280 000 non-citizens compared to just 80 000 in estonia ? 
  and afaik , they ca n't even vote in local elections , while those in estonia can . 
   we are not newcomers , most russians in latvia lived in latvia for longer then latvia existed as an independent state or where born in lativa to those people . 
  i know latvia had some significant russian minority before wwii aswell ( way bigger than in estonia ) , but the majority of today 's russians were still soviet-era migrants . 
   what is that `` difference '' that you want to see ? 
  my point is that i believe that there is a latvian russian / estonian russian etc identity when i see from opinion polls and value surveys that baltic russians have more similar values to estonians/latvians than to russians in russia . 
  that is not the case today , not even close . 
  according to their statistics offices , yeah . 
  just look at [ moldova ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/moldova/population ) - choose max an you can see the `` tiny '' miscalculation their census revealed in 1998 . 
  and yet , they 've continued to calculate that only a handful of people leave the country . 
  i mean , i would n't be surprised if the population was actually below 3 million at this point . 
  i have no idea why they 're doing such things when it 's obvious to any sane person that the data is completely wrong . 
  that 's not how it works . 
  belarus is in europe and far away from those underdeveloped african or asian countries that would prefer belarus . 
  if they come this far , they 'd definitely choose a wealthier country than belarus . 
  russia is an immigration destination because of its ties to former ussr in central asia and caucasus . 
  you have widely known russian language which people there can still somewhat speak , you have special agreements with those countries which make labour movement easier etc , and moscow and st. petersburg are more or less wealthy cities even by european standards . 
  and for ukraine , c'mon , that data is just absurd . 
  ukraine is in a military conflict , it is incredibly corrupt and its gdp ( ppp ) per capita is below several african ones . 
  it 's surrounded by countries that are richer . 
  it 's not realistic in any circumstances that it has positive net migration . 
  forced in the sense that locals could n't really get to decide anything about what happened in their own country , that included about who migrated there . 
   it is possible to speak russian and still be proud to be latvian . 
  yes , it 's possible , but it 's incredibly unlikely . 
  identities like these take a lot of time , even centuries to form , but most russians in latvia are newcomers . 
  it does n't help that most of them also grow up in a russian information sphere ( and russian in the sense of russian federation , not only russian language ) and therefore , really do n't differ much from russians of russia . 
   belarus is cleaner and less corrupt , more soviet so to speak . 
  these might invite a few russians , but are definitely not the main arguments for somebody to leave their ( wealtheir ) home country . 
   plus more higher costs and more criminality . 
  just like every other economic center in the world . 
  i mean , latvian forests are very peaceful , clean and quiet , but people still wo n't move there . 
   the economic problems you used as counter-argument are a recent issue , but the data are for 2010-2015 . 
  well , we also have the 2011 crisis with the currency there . 
  my point was that there 's no major growth to attract workers , and the living standards are not high enough to attract people , except for ukrainians i guess . 
  but even then , there are more attractive destinations . 
   during the communist era , things were terrible , but at least fertility held up . 
  that 's why i am saying you 're rambling . 
  the deterioation really started after communism , hence the transition period was a failure . 
  in countries like estonia and latvia , soviet occupation actually made these nations have one of the lowest fertility rates in europe and completely miss the post-wwii child boom of europe . 
  yes , the transition to market economy had a huge blow to post-soviet states , but it was largely unavoidable .

  yes . 
  this is one of the reasons why i 'm against african and middle-eastern immigration . 
  school segregation is wrong but so is being bullied by teenage immigrant thugs , held back in class because minority students are usually slower and having to brace for shitstorm every time pork is served at the school cafeteria or christmas party comes around . 
  i can understand why parents of white children would want segregation . 
  best way to solve a problem is to avoid it . 
  it 's called proxy war/fighting . 
  number 8 can draw hands pretty well , i 'm jealous . 
  also it looks like most serbian citizens ca n't decide which alphabet to use . 
  his kind yet near-deadpan delivery makes it so much better . 
  there is no need for such accessories , a proper roundhouse kick will suffice . 
  last year estonia passed a law recognizing gay partnerships ( but not marriage ) . 
  unfortunately it brought all the homophobes out of the woodwork and generated a very heated debate , if you can call it that . 
  result ? 
  this year , for the first time ever , our only real right-wing party managed to pass the 5 % threshold and get 7 seats in the parliament out of 101 . 
  if it was up to me , i 'd legalise same-sex marriage today but it seems to me that as a nation we are not ready for this yet . 
  as for a referendum , honestly , i have no idea what the results would be if we had one now . 
  oh come on . 
  it 's the friendly kind of slap on the cheek , like the kind you give to a child or if you 're italian . 
  why thank you , good sir . 
  this is exactly what i was looking for . 
  literally what the jihadists are doing . 
  also probably some laws about discharging a firearm within city limits . 
  seriously though , baltic cities seem to be overrun with wildlife all of a sudden . 
  i saw a rabbit in my parking lot just two days ago . 
  how many of those immigrants/emigrants are british citizens ? 
  over here , most of our immigrants are actually estonian citizens moving back and forth . 
  i do n't know about britain but imagine there to be quite a lot of britons living between the uk and usa/canada/eu / rest of the world . 
  likewise non-british citizens , especially the eu ones , often tend to return to their home countries . 
  these statistics would provide a much better overview if they were to omit the british citizens . 
  now where is the hemingway of our time ? 
  so he 's not an ethnic norwegian then ? 
  either way , i must say i question the wisdom of his actions . 
  i was stumped at `` welfare and diversity officer '' . 
  what the hell is that ? 
  [ hungarian economic growth has indeed been slow ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/economy_of_the_european_union#economic_growth ) . 
  between 2005 and 2014 , hungarian economy grew just 9.3 % , whereas the other eastern enlargement member states grew 21.5-38 .7 % and hungary went from being the second richest ( after czech republic ) to one of the poorest . 
  i 'm not quite sure what is the cause of this . 
  i know they tend to elect some rather populist politicians but politicians alone can not hold a country back that much . 
  which is why every pps statistic should be approached with a healthy dose of skepticism . 
  [ meanwhile the non-eu immigrants have cost britain a whopping # 118 billions ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/immigration/11210687/immigration-the-real-cost-to-britain.html ) . 
  something is very off balance here . 
  yay , more work for us wikipedians !, 
  no , it 's spanish-speakers laughing . 
  for the same reasons the said countries never joined earlier . 
  the cons of following eu rules and regulations involving fishing , banking and oil drilling ( all major parts of their economies ) outweigh the pros . 
  it 's because of all the drug addicts , not homosexuals . 
  russia has a ton of addicts , especially among the disenfranchised people living in soviet-era monotowns . 
  same in estonia , unfortunately , where there are a lot of ethnic russians in towns like [ narva ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/narva ) . 
  also russia produces a vast amount of absolutely horrid synthetic drugs . 
  there is not enough homosexuals anywhere in the world to bring up the numbers of hiv infected by this much . 
  levski had ** a lot ** of fans in germany back in the 1930s and 40s . 
  unless you intend on keeping it in piss-poor conditions in which case you risk it getting sick and dying , quite a lot . 
  that 's what i was going to say . 
  you can buy a used car for a few hundred euros , keeping a horse will cost you a lot more . 
  there are hardly any lybians among the refugees . 
  some authors used gypsy travellers as an archetype of true free spirits , unwilling to be confined in the yoke of baltic german nobility and russian monarchy . 
  gypsies were never slaves , owned no land , paid no taxes , did n't serve in anyones army etc. 
  basically the ultimate freedom lovers from a poet 's pov . 
  technically romania is post-socialist , not soviet since they were never actually a part of the soviet union . 
  the difference would be that despite being * de facto * ruled by russia , they still managed to maintain somewhat of an independent economy and did n't get flooded by hordes of russian migrants . 
  anyway , this was just a jokey polandball comic . 
  thought it 'd be fitting because of how crossed romanians get when someone thinks they 're roma . 
  [ romania sets things straight ] ( http://i.imgur.com/hwecarb.png ) . 
   i belive that for 90 % of them it was quite clear what `` going to work '' really meant ... back in the 90s when everyone was poor and naive about the west , this might 've been the case .

  if people here think it might win , i gather the competition sucks . 
  in other words , hungary loses over 7 % of it 's air force . 
  this is bad . 
  not sure who from estonia would fit here . 
  basically we have various ethnic russian centered groups , generally described as far left and label themselves as `` anti-fascist '' or `` human rights '' groups but really they 're just pro-russia ( meaning the so-called human rights ' activists are also diehard homophobes for example ) . 
  they 're not very big because most russians have understood small radical groups will never make much of an impact . 
  as far as political parties go we have a estonian united left party which is based on the remnants of the old soviet communist party . 
  they are a joke and get like 0.1 % votes top . 
  excuse me ? 
  what kind of stuff ? 
  obviously the truth is somewhere inbetween . 
  while the anti-immigration groups love to emphasize on these statistics too much , this article also tries too hard to ` debunk ' them . 
  while it is possible swedish women are somewhat more forthcoming about reporting rape this alone can not explain the huge discrepancy between sweden and other western nations . 
  it 's not like rape is such a major taboo everywhere else but sweden . 
  drawing parallels between rape and murder is also unwarranted since people commiting these crimes are driven by different socio-economic motives . 
  rape is motivated most and foremost by sexual frustration , whereas murders are commited for a wide range of reasons ( gangs and organized crime powerstruggles , personal feuds , cross-ethnic conflicts , poverty , domestic abuse ) . 
  depending on country and culture there can be very little correlation between the two . 
  100 % pro-gay rights ( marriage , adoption ) and know a few people who are gay/bi-sexual . 
  however , a straight male , i ca n't help but to wonder sometimes how someone could look at a female and think `` ugh , do n't want any of that '' . 
  they just look so much better than us guys ... 
  goes to show how different we all are . 
  fyi , poland recently purchased over 100 leopard tanks too .

  not so sound . 
   but , please , reciprocate . 
  forget about us . 
  let us live in any shit we want . 
  as if estonia was doing any aggression towards russia . 
  remember [ 2007 cyberattacks on estonia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_cyberattacks_on_estonia ) ? 
  or [ abduction of eston kohver ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eston_kohver ) ? 
  or , probably that russia still did not ratify the border agreement with estonia , while estonia already signed and ratified this ? 
  how come that hostile estonia did this while peaceful russia still cites some imaginary excuses in order to avoid that ? 
  it is sad , though , that some people are willing to live with corruption and broken laws . 
   you can not stop the invasion you are afraid of with conventional arms , alas . 
  but , repeat , relax . 
  i know that given that estonia is a nato member russia will never invade us , so we are not afraid of it . 
  how conveniently you miss the `` russia is much poorer than estonia , and has much worse income level , gdp per capita , corruption , media freedom , ease of doing business , etc , rankings . '' . 
  you live in shit and want everyone else to live in shit too . 
  nobody will defend estonia to death point . 
  and it could happen to the world with all that nukes . 
  yes , whatever your russian tv tells you . 
  ussr also was supposed to stay forever . 
  your comment does not make any sense . 
  if russia would invade estonia it would trigger nato article 5 and eu article 42.7 and russia would be defeated by combined eu and nato power . 
  and as to `` spend money '' - russia is much poorer than estonia , and has much worse income level , gdp per capita , corruption , media freedom , ease of doing business , etc , rankings . 
  troops are not an economic support ... and these troops also cost estonia money . 
   we will lose . 
  money . 
  we are ready to spend some on russian crimea , not estonia . 
  lol . 
  compare gdp and average income in estonia and in russia . 
  yours are 2-3 times lower . 
  and i am even not talking that russia would be defeated if it was to attack estonia . 
  what kind of milk ? 
  is that milk called instability ? 
  it looks like that you have vision problems . 
  i will repeat it once again for you :  ** until the crimean invasion and the eastern ukraine war ** , there were much less nato troops in estonia . 
  think about it . 
  also , it may be a surprise for you , but estonia is also a nato member . 
  happy 4th of july . 
  god save the queen . 
  if those 6 can be in the eu with their levels of corruption ( some higher ) why could n't serbia be ? 
  i personally think all corrupt countries should not be a part of eu . 
  but this seems to be not regulated by eu . 
  you really think russians would send in their men to die for 0 gain ? 
  i do not think that russia would invade estonia today or this year , but if it suddenly decides to do so we should be ready . 
  yes , russia would gain 0 or very few by that , but they are already involved in the crimean and eastern ukraine conflict and they are also getting 0 from that . 
   because 6 of 28 countries have a problem , my argument is nulled ? 
  do you know there are 23 others ? 
  at the moment , given it 's high corruption , serbia would belong the part of 6 . 
   no , it 's estonia who thinks that it 's worth the hassle of spending lives , money and arms . 
  russia would gain literally 0 things from invading estonia it already does not have . 
  until the crimean invasion and the eastern ukraine war , there were much less nato troops in estonia . 
  think about it . 
   did not mean those two , meant croatia , bulgaria , romania , hungary etc. 
  so , let 's sum up : croatia , bulgaria , romania , hungary , greece , italy all have relative high corruption and they all are members of eu . 
  means your argument that `` eu means no corruption and that 's why estonia has no corruption '' is nulled . 
   what ? 
  o.o that 's exactly the ego trip you 're having that im talking about , since you got into nato you 've been busting your chest at russia is it estonia who flies it 's aircraft near russian border ? 
  also , is it estonia who is doing `` zapad 2017 '' exercises near russian border ? 
  probably it is also [ estonia who abducted russian policeman ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eston_kohver ) ? 
  and , of course , [ 2007 estonian cyber attacks on russia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_cyberattacks_on_estonia ) . 
   the fact that i think mogherini and hahn and major eu finance institutions are who we should listen to regarding what the eu thinks of serbia 's accession yes , all other talking heads also promised that turkey will join eu by 1970 , then 1980 , 1990 , ... now this is again delayed . 
  the same with serbia . 
  nothing is preventing serbia from fixing corruption or media freedom , but yet , this is not happening . 
   all those countries that i have seen have similar score to serbia are the countries that are debated if they joined correctly . 
  i did not know that there are debates that , for example , italy or greece joined `` too early '' . 
  so , still no . 
   no , we are talking about your smug attitude , calling out other nations about their ` ego ' and you live in a nation that has the biggest ego trip i have seen after the united states . 
  really ? 
  estonia is a part of eu , nato , oecd and has good corruption , freedom of speech and ease of doing business rankings . 
  serbia is not a part of neither of them , but from what i hear from the news and other serbs on reddit , i would think that serbia has all issues fixed and it 's just usa that is always blamed for everything , is preventing serbia from joining eu . 
   because you mostly have to clear it to join the eu in the first place . 
  one of the few members that has corruption is romania , and its debatable if they got in too early . 
  i see on this map https://www.transparency.org/news/feature/corruption_perceptions_index_2016 that some ( more than 3 ) eu members have higher corruption that romania does . 
   you still are missing the point , im talking about the ego , not corruption . 
  probably it is you who is missing the point , we are talking about serbia here , not about estonia . 
  so what is about ego ? 
  is serbia in your opinion a crucial part of europe so everyone should let join it immediately ? 
  how does membership in eu help fighting corruption ? 
  there are members of eu with high corruption . 
  compare corruption in serbia and in estonia . 
  oh lol your comment is so ussr style , `` opinion of people does not matter while the great leaders think the right way '' . 
  check these links - https://www.transparency.org/country/srb - https://rsf.org/en/serbia is it still `` my contempt '' or just the reality ? 
  and what ? 
  is seriba something of extreme importance so we should all hurry up and let you join ? 
  no , in reality it is just a corrupt country with huge ego . 
  yeah and things like berlin wall , censorship , stasi ... communist apologists always omit them .

  no we will never agree with that and no we will never stfu so you can do your dirty business . 
  pretty close , yes . 
  except that allies help each-other when in need . 
  history has shown to us who we can trust and who not . 
  it 's not personal , i even disagree with it , but i just tried to open up sentiments in eastern-europe towards western-europe . 
  you pretty much just do n't matter anymore . 
  you really have no teeth . 
  serious ? 
  well , we have some people ( jesuits or something , i 'm not very familiar with different sect names in english ) who deny blood transplant . 
  even to their children . 
  if case is serious enough , doctor can actually just do it . 
  yes , its about being allies and helping your allies during time of need . 
  actually yes . 
  it 's not about iraq . 
  it 's about who helps us when we need help . 
  we know its not french . 
  they just tell us to stfu and do not anger russia , so they can sell more mistrals . 
  i do not agree about iraq attack . 
  i think hussein was very bad person and deserved death , but i also think that world is full of such dictators . 
  i did ( and do ) agree with our government that if americans go in , we must help or else we have no hope for help when we need it . 
  why else would guy from kentucky come and die in this little piece of land on other side of the world ? 
  that 's what being allies mean . 
  i know its foreign concept for many western-europeans who up to today do not understand that security has cost . 
  it 's pretty common sentiment in eastern-europe . 
  i think that this `` they missed a great opportunity to shut up . 
  ( jack chirac ) '' is paying dividends after all those years . 
  no , we do not forget . 
  we know who are our allies and who are `` allies '' . 
  that 's why actually majority of people do not understand why we send our troops to help you in africa . 
  yes , with 21 % tax . 
  salary is taxed with around 50 % tax . 
  you do not pay social tax from dividends . 
  it 's common practice for business owners to pay themself minimal salary ( and social tax from that ) and take out everything else as dividens . 
  so we can easily say that social tax does not affect them . 
   taxing effects both of them . 
  yes , but not always where you would love it to be . 
  why else most countries fight against `` tax-heavens '', 
  i do n't argue about this . 
  i argue about the fact that huge amount of people somehow think that they do not pay social tax . 
  who does then ? 
  employers have no magic fairy somewhere , every tax is taken from value added by workers . 
  nobody pays your taxes but you . 
  no , not government . 
  no , not company owner . 
  you pay your taxes . 
  how its named and where is hidden is irrelevant . 
  every tax cost must be earned by you . 
  i do not understand people who concentrate on our 21 % income tax , when it 's not even half of your total tax . 
  yes , that 's correct . 
  our problem is actually caused by bit different part . 
  big companies often just do n't pay tax . 
  they abuse different loopholes and avoid paying taxes in estonia at all . 
  thats news . 
  i thought we argue all the time about fact that social tax does not affect rich at all . 
  they pay themself minimum and then take everything else as dividends . 
  it does not affect them at all . 
  i 'm sorry to burst your bubble , but he lied to you . 
  it depends who you are . 
  if you are extremely rich , yes you will go along almoust untaxed . 
  you can get away with 21 % . 
  if you work for living , then we speak about tax level around 52 % . 
  it 's just hidden and some simpler minds think that it 's not even tax . 
  yes , we have weird tax system , we tax weakest . 
  do not spill out that shit . 
  there is no point to lie to people . 
   estonia 's overall taxes account for only 32 % of gdp ** statistics can show very weird things . 
  this one for example is worthless . 
  it is low because we have very limited amount of people we tax . 
  basically we only tax workforce . 
  everything else is heavily under-taxed . 
  ok , i understand better now . 
  what ? 
  i do n't understand at all . 
  did you answer to someone else or something ? 
  i told that roads in poland are in very good condition lately . 
  not involved , blamed, 
  revolution here i come , down with suomi opressors , give me freedom or ... potato, 
  you still have to learn countries official language : estonian . 
  good luck, 
  my country of me just followed democratic process and we decided to annex your puny tiny pointless country . 
  thats ok , as long as we get to annex what we want, 
  ok , but we call st.petersburg and ingermanland . 
   the czech republic has even more serviceable airports than it 's neighbor poland , combined with modern infrastructure and highway as a person who quite often drives through poland i can tell you that condition of polish highways ( and other type of roads ) have enormously improved during last 5-7 years . 
  north-eastern part is lagging behind , maybe some more places i have not visited too , but from the middle ( around warsaw ) to east and west and south is very well covered . 
  we have more then 3000 . 
  we have peace-time army and war-time army . 
  we have mandatory military service and during war-time there will be mobilization . 
  in general yes . 
  they dont have to force through belarus , belarus is their very good ally . 
  they can also force through north-eastern poland . 
  also not to forget that in any serious escalation ( hope it will never happen ) baltic states are really easy to cut off from our allies through north-eastern poland . 
  there is basically very short strip to cut and we are in one big pocket . 
  no , we never had any real heavy equipment . 
  we concentrate only on light infantry . 
  sad i think . 
   your argument might have some merit if the russian minorities living in estonia and latvia had n't already been living there for some 200 + years . 
  we have no trouble with old-orthodox refugees , they are very nice people . 
  very small minority .

  and what exactly makes estonia baltic ? 
  except the switch is not centralized for other nations . 
   good regional cooperation is beneficial for both of our countries and it 's sad you want to kill it and another strawman . 
  with russia , you do just flip a switch and they will start believing what they are told to believe , just as always . 
  so russians will just hate , who they are told to hate . 
  wanna-be-nordics ? 
  the fuck ? 
  we have nothing against lithuanians , it 's just that we have almost nothing in common ... 
  i 'm not inventing my own terms . 
  baltic = latvian and lithuanian and not estonian , end of discussion ...  see ? 
  you can understand , if you want to fine , just take out single sentences that you like and disregard the rest ...  yeah , right , except quite clearly not really they are north germanic languages . 
  nordic languages is a rarely used term and often includes finnish as it 's supposed to mean languages of the nordic countries , which is not a linguistic term anymore . 
  and by relationship i meant `` related '' relationship . 
  the strawman is fully on you . 
  invading random countries , supporting totalitarian dictatorships , threatening your smaller neighbors , forcing down any opposition , launching a massive propaganda network , organizing a corrupted state , creating a cult of personality etc etc etc = rational ... 
   lithuanians too !, 
  that for you perhaps , we have almost nothing in common with them . 
   normally accomplishes them fairly well . 
  so does a crazy person when he wants to chop a random lady into pieces and store the meat in his fridge ... 
  is n't it logical to start from the north and go clockwise ? 
  that would work in the opposite direction as well if he started from the north ... 
  a wider ethnic group , whatever ... 
  it does n't matter if both terms derive from the baltic sea - the term baltic still refers to latvians and lithuanians as the baltic peoples . 
  and because the nordics is a political concept . 
  which the baltic states is too if you want to include estonia , but they are composed differently : - nordics include north germanic and finnic nations and the term nordic languages is therefore mis-attributed to either meaning all languages of this group or is a rarely used synonym to north germanic languages - in essence it 's a vague term without an official meaning . 
  and if it already includes finland , then it should include estonia as well . 
  the nordics are way past the language criteria . 
  - baltic languages are however very certain languages and therefore estonia should not be associated with this group . 
  you can not go past the language criteria with this group as both balts and baltic peoples only refer to latvians and lithuanians and not estonians . 
  so you think it 's ok to have your language group associated with an incorrect group ? 
  how do you feel about being associated with slavic or germanic languages for the matter ? 
  actually , it 's even wrong , it 's rather turkic or really swahili , as estonian and finnish have no relation to baltic languages . 
  there is no bad stigma , just non-existing relationship . 
  and why would i think you are like russians ? 
  ** another strawman !!!, 
   from south to north , counter clockwise but why though ? 
  finland : sisu , islands , lakes , rally , finns always have good relations with us in my experience russia : oh boy . 
  russian cinema ? 
  latvia : riga , it 's a wonderful city !, 
  and as with finns , latvians always have good relations with us in my experience sweden : that you accepted estonian refugees in 1944, 
  perhaps we should n't care about the opinions of people , who believe in fairy tales ? 
  do n't worry , latvia will send another one . 
  the germans do n't hate the americans ... and the us forces there very likely held off a possible soviet invasion . 
  if a defense policy is successful enough , we will never know it as the enemy will choose not to invade at all . 
  and right now russia is indeed the enemy . 
  since when ? 
  did they find a cure ? 
  what ? 
  he 's reasonable to you ? 
   if you claim not to be our friends by nature another strawman , how many is that already ? 
  but what if we do n't want to belong to a region named after a larger ethnic group that does n't relate to us ? 
  i do n't particularly remember , but did they ask for more actual assistance than they got during the initial invasion phase ? 
  because after the invasion , most of the members did join in . 
  not only are they gay . 
  they are eurogay . 
  that 's like twice the gay !, 
  we also have [ this ] ( https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/0a/08/54/narva.jpg ) . 
  does n't open . 
  [ oh really ? 
  you are looking for reasonable predictions on how an unreasonable dictator will act . 
  it 's really not in this case . 
  how is this aggressive ? 
  nato is an outdated system ? 
  by what standards ? 
  and do n't even start with the silly `` the soviet union is no more , there are no enemies left '' rhetoric . 
   the us would be way better of focusing east and mending relations with russia . 
  and how do you mend relations with an imperialist dictatorship , which is a threat to your allies and therefore to yourself ? 
   national socialism is the only answer . 
  oh i get it , you 're an idiot ... 
  no one else was particularly sizable either ... 
  and why go to war if you can make deals with the invader . 
  after all , it 's not your country he 's invading ... #appeasement #munichaccords, 
  but now tell me this , if we claim we are not baltic by nature , why do you think we need to leave a cooperation group of friendly neighboring countries ? 
  it is as wrong for us as to call a german a swahili . 
  yeah , the `` we are all humans '' and `` all kind of nationalism is bad '' shit, 
   seriously ? 
  an easilly provable fact is my logical fallacy ? 
  you still fail to see your logical fallacy . 
  can you answer me please , if estonia wants to be nordic , then why is it a precondition in your mind that it leaves the baltic regional cooperation organs ? 
  thank you , i did n't actually know they accepted finland later , now there 's a good argument for accepting estonia as well !, 
   it 's only stigma , because you consider being baltic a bad thing . 
  when have i ever said that ? 
  you keep pulling strawmen arguments on me !, 
  wrong for us = / = bad . 
   but trying to make your country look superior to others again , when has this been the case ? 
  you keep inventing stuff , are you imagining things in your head or what ? 
  you mean the oppressed russian liberators ? 
   integration of them rather no integration with some exceptions . 
  i am from [ this place ] ( http://g3.nh.ee/images/pix/728x352/2gfohzbra0w/file124136_124136.734x408.jpg ) so i know . 
  why would you be sorry ? 
  i am well aware of that . 
  if you want chocolate that is also technically chocolate , then you can pick any other brand , it 's not like we only produce white chocolate . 
  and i picked that because it is really considered to be a good one and for normal people in normal circumstances constitutes a chocolate . 
  more like a step-child , but whatever , 
   if estonia is not baltic , but nordic why is it part of baltic regional cooperation schemes perhaps that 's your logical fallacy . 
   why is it not instead a full member of nordic council , but only an observer just like latvia and lithuania ? 
  because estonia was occupied by the ussr and the nordic council was organized in 1953 and has n't taken in new members ever since . 
  also there is the very same stupid stigma that estonia is baltic , which mostly comes from scandinavians not knowing shit about estonian history and culture . 
  also the argument often heard is that estonia is poor , or even the stupid argument that estonia does n't have nordic cross flag like it was some precondition or something . 
   do acctualy read and think what was said instead of spewing your nationalist ideas non-stop .

  cute , but not realistic . 
  no matter how many russian approve putin at any given time it is 96 % of russians who approve russian imperialism and their right to rule over others at all times . 
  there was 5104 immigrants from russia to latvia in 2014 . 
  the numbers are bigger than you think and i believe they should be smaller . 
  if immigration remains as easy or gets easier then the number will grow from this 5000 and that for every year . 
  why would you want any more russians ? 
  i think there are already far too many and the new ones are going to bring their own problems . 
  why would you want to invite problems to your country when you already have so many of them ? 
  they are not going to integrate or learn the language . 
  they will live in their parallel societies and grow them . 
  while germany is certainly technically ` off shore ' from ukraine , it is not the meaning of the word those who only read the headlines will get from that article . 
  company in germany is not the same as company in panama . 
  bad journalism .

  it reads like uninformed musings of a teenage girl .

  how about you stop your passive aggressive remarks while weaving your silly apologism and face the reality . 
  russian minister of transportation shows in this very article the adulthood one can expect from russia . 
   and surely there would be less outcry how about telling russia to stick their dishonest outcry where the sun do n't shine ? 
  looks more like austin powers villain to me . 
  eu subsidies latvia has received are rather small when compared to russian natural resource income . 
  ppp is just wrong . 
  perhaps not as a concept , but the way it is calculated currently . 
  that cauliflower facebook likes bullshit again . 
   lithuanian food prices have increased significantly since the country adopted the euro in january 2015 , with the cost of some items tripling , ** analysts say ** . 
  what a weasel way to put it . 
  `` analysts say '' . 
  below is a food inflation chart since january 2015 and it shows the food prices have lowered . 
  pre-pension people have much more to fear . 
  they 're getting fired if they do n't toe the line and be without income . 
  people are afraid to speak truth in the phone polls . 
  they do n't want to end up in some list and with all that is going on in russian occupied crimea their fear is justified . 
  old fake story shit . 
  ukrainians actually gave aid to a russian fuck who had traveled to their country to kill them . 
  ukrainians do n't torture . 
  it is a different crowd . 
  russians and ukrainians ending up in this fight are very different . 
  ukrainian fighters are those volunteering to defend their home from invasion and russians are those who believe they were robbed of a chance to fortune by being too young in the 90s , but at least there is a gangster 's paradise in ukraine now , where one could make a great fortune . 
  showing this ` motorola ' , who is an ugly dwarf having been a loser working in car-wash and now turning into a war-chief with big tittied wife and life of luxury is a great recruitment tool . 
  `` if that loser can do it then there is no stopping me '' . 
  russians torture the prisoners . 
  these men are going through something that should not be also . 
  i believe his little group is not much of a party either as they even failed to get enough signatures to participate in the elections . 
  flying with transponders off and ignoring air traffic control is not business as usual . 
  hope so . 
  then again russians are ruled by dumbasses . 
  how did it benefit russia to become a third world level petrostate ? 
  what is putin 's clever plan ? 
  these cos-sacks is just a cos-play for government brownshirts . 
   [ russia ] will seize territory in eastern ukraine , open up a land corridor to crimea and invade the baltic states . 
  well , that sucks !, 
  i wish they 'd stopped doing things like that - going after unimportant cogs in a machine who did n't even do anything and are guilty by association . 
  seeing this makes me all the angrier about actual soviet war criminals and cruel mass murderers getting away scot-free and treated like heroes . 
  dumbest thing i have ever read . 
  [ a brief guide to electoral fraud for the busy despot ] ( http://www.economist.com/node/21548946 ), 
  what a stupid article . 
  `` just watch the door handle video , man !, 
  analysts analyse stuff and disagree , but they probably have n't seen the door handle video . '', 
  it is not even comparable to actual judge passing verdics . 
  the position is administrative and the background of that person is law enforcement . 
  without saying whether the person is right or wrong i 'd argue that since ukrainian prosecution office 's biggest problem is corruption by criminal networks having prosecutors , assistants or even clerks on the take the law enforcement background is more useful in cleaning that up than being the most brilliant legal professor in all the universities . 
  i am not sure . 
  i think ukrainian prosecution offices main problem is not knowing the law enough so the top administration should be the top legal scholar . 
  the problems are due to corruption and criminal ties , so the law enforcement background is relevant . 
  you are well known vatnik poster . 
  please do n't try to pretend that you have observed the situation in ukraine and the facts caused you to have a pessimistic view of ukraine 's future not under russian boot . 
  should have stolen say 30 billion instead of the 70 billion he did and the money to resist russian pressure would have been still there . 
  he 'd also be more popular and afford the reforms . 
  that was half-assing it and ended as failure . 
  same way as if poland , the baltics etc would have ended as failure with that kind of half-assing . 
   it would have been incompatible with european integration true  and yanukovich was working on it the whole time he was a president until the end of 2013 yanukovich did exactly what i said meaning he really was n't working very hard on european integration . 
  this is how he got elected . 
  east voted for him because he is a local boy and west voted for him because he made promises of reducing corruption and advancing european integration . 
  he did not fulfill his election promises of course . 
  they were only for getting elected . 
  i forgot to say all former commie countries now in the eu . 
  i agree that it is not true for russia , ukraine , belarus and central asia . 
  yanukovych stacked the important positions with his cronies and used technicality to abolish the 2005 ukrainian constitution ( that was voted in by 90 % of the mp-s ) . 
  this moved ukraine back to their post-soviet constitution that gave president huge amounts of power . 
  yanukovych then started to implement a set of anti-democracy to shut down the public voice . 
  that was preparation of becoming president for life . 
  now the 2005 constitution has been restored and these anti-democracy laws have been abolished . 
  of course ukraine is still having a lot of problems , but no one expected everything solved by 2016 . 
  there is this model of a post-soviet country with pretend democracy and president for life , whose corrupt system stays largely on russian support . 
  they gather in a club of russia 's eeu . 
  yanukovych was moving ukraine toward becoming such country . 
   but since by now it has become absolutely clear that the corruption is not going anywhere it is not clear to me . 
  all former commie countries had huge problems with corruption and all have improved tremendously during the past 20 + years . 
  it is stupid to say that since corruption is still an important issue in ukraine in 2016 that means everything is a failure and lets now all support russia annexing it . 
  the issue is in another place . 
  laws allow ~ $ 70 per day tax free daily allowance for people traveling abroad in work related matters + there are things like paying large tax free compensation when they go with their own car or when they have to rent . 
  the law was meant for short business trips , but due to the way it is written it allows extended stay with most of the income coming from these tax free allowances . 
   every ** country ** has been caught doping having athletes using doping is common , but here we have things like fsb involved in hiding russia 's doping use . 
  nope . 
  these are not `` regular russians doing just what it means to them '' . 
  riding your motorcycles costume played as tank under soviet flags is something else . 
  something meant to provoke . 
  regular russians ask silly things like `` if i were to take a tourist trip to estonia would i be mistreated because i speak russian '' ( the answer is no ) .

   comparing ukraine to those conflicts suggests massive ignorance of the relevant history . 
  you 've got to admit that firstly , they share many similarities , such as russia 's leadership 's skyrocketing popularity with every conflict ( so we should take it as a convenient tool for a failing leader - just invade a neighbour !, 
  ) , then the already mentioned propaganda war ( georgians/ukrainians/moldovans want to kill the ethnic minorities !, 
  ) , and finally , the questionable results - ruining the relations with each of those countries and creating some non-functioning entities ( at least there 's no killing going on - hinting that other nations ca n't peacefully co-exist ) . 
  uhm , why are you attacking me ? 
  i 'm not some kind of an expert , i 'm just stating my opinion here . 
   according to a study in 2010 , only 16 % of people of age would volunteer to join armed forces if finland would have a career army . 
  but these people would not serve only like , half a year , it would be their profession . 
  so that 16 % is not `` only '' , i would be surprised if it was really that high . 
   a survey in 2014 found that only 11 % of the finnish population wish to abolish conscription . 
  that 's indeed something finns themselves can decide and if they like it that way , so be it . 
   what are the reasons for average age at primiparity in finland being 28,6 years and age of all parturients 30,4 years ? 
  the western trend that people want to have a stable income , job and a house before starting a family , i guess . 
  conscription might indeed prolong it , but then we have the general issue of whether conscription is a better alternative to professional army or not . 
   how exactly would temporary exemption from service correct this ? 
  temporary exemption ? 
  who said anything about temporary exemption ? 
   one option would be full exemption from service if a woman has borne children , but would that be considered to fulfill gender equality ? 
  should n't all fathers then also be exempt from military service completely ? 
  why not . 
  such people often have a family and a career and pausing that is not easy , not to mention the family would lose an important chunk of their income . 
   what would be the consequences of exempting all parents from military service ? 
  would the armed forces have less , or more soldiers in the standing army ? 
  you mentioned the average age when women have children , so that 's quite high . 
  at that age , people are not usually conscripted anymore , so i ca n't see it having any significant changes . 
  maybe it 'd motivate some people to start a family earlier , though . 
  well , if anything , then at least it 's easier to push for tough reforms now than it was before . 
  the economy is bottoming out , ukraine is extremely cheap ( attractive for exports and outsourcing ) and most importantly , the people want , no , they actually require reforms . 
  the police reform has had some effect for example . 
  however , the country needs to have at least territorial integrity and no armed conflict , frozen or not , going on . 
  however cheap , big , supportive and well-resourced ukraine was , i would n't invest there it they could burst into flames any day . 
  yeah , it would n't really go away with a change in government . 
  ukraine 's relations with russia might normalize someday , but they 'll never get back to the point they were before . 
  ukrainians will always remember that russia violently took a piece of land from them and with its intervention , helped to kill over 9 ' 000 people . 
  these are things that wo n't be forgotten and it 's the same story with georgia and moldova . 
  i do n't know why russians think these things will be forgotten . 
  they wo n't . 
  russia has permanently ruined its relations with these countries , unless it gives back the occupied territories ( which is , let 's be honest , extremely unlikely ) . 
   ukraine and russia are not arch enemies , and are highly unlikely to ever become such . 
  this is simply because of the family ties across borders being massively prevalent . 
  i hope you realize i used that term to characterize the level of hostility right now . 
  that 's why i also said ` long-term partner ' . 
  and what do you imagine happens with those pseudo-republics ? 
  those will never become functioning countries , they 'll slowly rot and die , and are generally like a gun aiming at ukraine , ready to fire whenever they feel like it . 
  what is more , they block development of eastern ukraine in particular , as effectively a slice has been cut out there and i 'm sure companies avoid even the surrounding areas , just in case . 
   at this rate estonia will be at the same level with the nordic countries ( or even above ) in a few decades . 
  not very realistic , there should be some structural changes in economy for that . 
  much of our growth has been on nordic investments and we produce few products for the end consumer . 
  we depend on others and yet our profit margins are not big . 
  finland has such powerful companies like kone , stora enso , nokia , neste etc. 
  the only considerable player here is tallink and they would n't fit even in 20 largest finnish companies . 
  you also manage to produce new success stories , such as rovio , that add to finnish economy . 
  we have skype ( which was only developed here , the idea came from scandinavians ) , but even that is hqd in luxembourg and only partial development has stayed here . 
  maybe if eu pressurized the tax heaven enough so they 'd return to their home town ? 
  :d oh well , we can hope . 
  how do you think we like the fact that in every few years , we have more and more of those pseudo-republics as a result of russia 's interventions and then we 'll soon find out about europe forgetting them and building some new gas pipelines to russia , so we 'd be even more dependant on russia and even less capable of resisting such situations in the future ? 
  and i 'm not talking about sending soldiers there , as long as russia is there , it would be insane . 
  but there should be a stronger reaction . 
  imo , sounds better for both ukraine and russia than the first one having a permanent pseudo-state in its borders and the latter being archenemies with its long-term partner and the west . 
   unless they hook those machines up to the internet or something and doing that with a power plant would be all kinds of retarded , no matter the os . 
  `` i 'll just check facebook for a few minutes . '', 
  cute cats ! '', 
  so we 'll admit that russia has annexed a part of ukraine , has invaded another part and the response for this are temporary sanctions ? 
  yeah , not my idea of mainting normal relations . 
  it depends . 
  as long as they cover topics where russia does n't have its own special interests/views , it 's fine . 
  otherwise , you 'll find out some `` interesting '' stuff you never knew , like baltics actually having an apartheid regime where speaking russian language is banned , or that the malaysian airlines was shot down by ukrainian destroyer etc. 
  another topics which they like to cover are problems of eu ( because putin 's russia would like to see that bloc collapsed better sooner than later ) , especially the rise of far-right and anti-americanism etc. 
  then race problems in usa ( and basically anything negative about usa ) , anti-nato , pro-russia stuff etc. 
  ukraine might be in a crisis , but comparing it to syria is a whole new level . 
  ukraine has just one country blocking the solution and that 's why i asked whether russia would satisfy with recognizing crimea in exchange for it helping ukraine ( that is , is it in their interests ) . 
  i do n't understand what he is even talking about . 
  baltics are in eu , so it 's natural they 'll integrate into eu . 
  by the way , if we he really wants european-russian integration , why is he against synchronizing kaliningrad to european grid then ? 
  double standards . 
  by that , i did n't ask why ukraine is incapable of doing that but why would that be seen as something very bad and horrible ( as it would inevitably result in casualties ) as opposed to a permanent frozen conflict . 
  they 'd succeed if it was n't for russia helping separatists . 
  and even more ideal option would be for russia to withdraw any support and let the separatist territories just collapse , but that 's unlikely because a ) russia would hardly agree to that , it would lose an important tool and secondly , would effectively admit its participation ; b ) the separatists would n't probably want to let go of their new power . 
  still , i also do n't see how ukraine could succeed with a frozen conflict . 
  i do n't think it would have any strong impacts , especially in nordic countries such as finland , where there are already very few full-time housewives . 
  what is more , a necessary rule would be that mothers and pregnant women would be fully exempt from service . 
   estonia is truly the post-soviet success story . 
  well , nice to see that somebody thinks like that . 
  i 'm generally disappointed how despite our proximity to nordics , which dominate almost every measurable welfare , happiness and success indicator in the world , we have not taken them as examples in so many fields . 
  iceland also has the highest internet penetration rate in europe , basically almost all the people have access to internet there . 
  you also have not the most enjoyable weather , so you enjoy surfing the internet in your warm homes more than italians , for example . 
   there has to be an end to the fighting and a stabilization of the conflict in the donbas . 
  my view has long been that the least-worst option for kyiv is a stable frozen conflict ( as opposed to an unstable one , or worse a hot conflict ) . 
  but one way or the other , kyiv has to end the violence . 
  i ca n't agree with this . 
  a frozen conflict would permanently cripple ukraine 's development . 
  it would be the always-hot topic that is never solved . 
  it would also be an easy tool for russia to `` heat '' things up whenever it feels necessary . 
  and certainly would n't eu nor nato accept members with such territories . 
  why ca n't the territory be reconquered by ukraine ? 
  they have the right to do that . 
  even better , maybe an international mission ? 
  it may sound horrible , but really , we should n't allow any more of such pseudo-states , there 's far too many of those in post-soviet countries . 
  and relations with russia should indeed recover to at least a civilized level . 
  would crimea 's recognition as part of russia in exchange for russia 's support for ukraine ( full support of dnr and lnr as integral part of ukraine , cheaper resources etc ) be viable ?

  in most countries you do n't vote for president either , or most of the government officials for that matter . 
  you do n't vote for diplomats and being one is the role of a monarch too . 
  i doubt that most of them are even gays . 
  probably just some people who are in the way or who are not liked by powerful people . 
  it is a lot easier to label them gays and get them sent away . 
  do n't like your neighbour ? 
  call the cops and tell them he is gay !, 
  literally anything other than that . 
  nice argument, 
  king is literally a president who is in the office for his entire life and who has some hereditary lands and buildings . 
  but his responsibility is huge , a lot bigger than of a ceremonial president . 
  source of pride , i would say . 
  in switzerland, 
  realistically what do you think would happen to hungary if it would let in immigrants ? 
  and realistically how many immigrants you think would come and stay in hungary ? 
  this is just populism . 
  the fact that those people are in power really shows how much hungarians buy that populism . 
  haha finns your language sucks, 
  if isis has been sneaking into europe in huge numbers , then acts of terrorism would happen a lot more frequently . 
  they are probably trying to hold a low profile and hope that they will be forgotten about . 
  i heard that the working conditions and the environment at his companies are horrible . 
  elon said , if i remember correctly , that people who quit his companies just ca n't cut it and maybe they should work for apple since it 's easier . 
   few nuclear power a few years ago there was a lot of discussions about this , many new innovative plans came up ( such as an underwater nuclear plant or something ) and we have a lot of raw material . 
  but then fukishima happened and people did n't want to talk about it anymore . 
  good thing that this is not my argumet . 
  now read what i wrote and what you wrote . 
  completely different points . 
  and euro is a `` bad idea '' because eu can not change economic policies of countries . 
  experts say that euroscepticism comes from being uninformed about the eu institutions and how the eu works . 
  so you are basically saying that you are proud that the czechs are stupid . 
  oppression of radical islamists . 
   ... because there are a lot of women who forced to wear this garb but unable to speak out because of their family/husband . 
  i think this is a main reason why burqas need to be banned . 
  it is a tool of oppression that should have no place in the free world . 
  the russian minory in togo is being oppressed and needs to be liberated . 
   and not in terms of the ukraine-russia conflict , because most russians in east ukraine identify as russian , whereas in estonia that 's not always the case . 
  in eastern-ukraine there are russian speaking men fighting against other russian speaking men . 
  their ethnicity means nothing , it 's beyond that . 
  a monarch is a symbol of the country . 
  it might seem abstract to you since finland does n't have monarchy . 
  this is some `` polish concentration camps '' level bullshit . 
   he got the harshest sentance available in norway . 
  exactly . 
  norwegian judiciary system regarding punishments/rehabilitations is built for petty criminals . 
  it was never meant for mass murderers . 
  yes he will be in prison for ever , they are going to add another 21 years after his first 21 are over , and then another if he lives that long . 
  but the conditions and treatment he is receiving in prison is not fit for a mass murderer . 
   or do you think he deserved to be tortured and then executed for the mass murder he comitted ? 
  sounds a lot more fair than what he is having now . 
   seems pretty dumb to take down a statue devoted to the millions who sacrificed themselves to make sure you do n't live under nazi rule today . 
  yeah but we ended up under soviet rule . 
   how in the hell is it a eurocentric concept ? 
  what does that even mean ? 
  for example the un human rights do n't work very well outside europe and north-america . 
  im talking about that the result of the `` fair trial '' is quite often unfair . 
  for example the breivik case . 
   every country in europe is a signatory to the un declaration of human rights , as well as the vast majority signed up to the echr which explicitly says that you 're guaranteed a right to a fair trial . 
  every country in even in europe is breaking human rights . 
  and the un has no executive power nor can it punish any country that is breaking those laws . 
  see saudi arabia for example . 
  human rights as such is an eurocentric concept . 
  it is not an universal truth and applying them to people who have denied human rights to millions is simply not fair . 
   ... you 're slipping down to the same level as them i have always considered `` slipping down to their level '' to be a ridiculous argument . 
  did those people who hung mussolini do the same things he did ? 
  on the same scale ? 
  were the nuremberg trials held by nazis to judge other nazis ? 
  because it was a kangaroo court . 
  so what is fair ? 
  that a closed court session decides that they shall be hanged , so they will be taken to a room with a few people and hang them ? 
  as if the crimes they have committed only meaned something to a few individuals ? 
  it was `` fair '' for them to feel the wrath of their own people . 
  perhaps on the last minutes of their lives they truly saw what they have done . 
  sure ... `` divine intervention '' ... that 's a fancy term for stealing our fucking flag . 
  [ we have one too ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/et/a/a1/ratsamonument_p%c3%bcha_j%c3%bcri_v%c3%b5itlus_lohega.jpg ), 
  some days you 'll see news that scots want another independence referendum , another day you hear that they do n't want one . 
  what is up with that ... 
  language and culture do n't matter in this case and they wo n't be affected . 
  it is the will to self-govern and to have some kind of exceptions is a problem . 
  probably at the camera and the infrastructure behind it . 
   when murdering others still brought us glory . 
  it still does . 
  it 's the western and northern-europe that are n't thinking that way . 
  the rest of the world still does , it does n't make them desperate , but it supports national identity and unity . 
  if you compare it to local governments then denmark did their 2007 administrative reform by not giving any exceptions to local governments that wanted to do things their own way and now their public management works fantastically and everyone is happy . 
  if european union or europe in general wants to stay relevant in the world then the eu has to be homogeneous and it 's legislative power has to be centralized . 
  diversity in policies and governing is n't good for anything , for example every country in the eu has their own economic policy whish has lead to the point where southern-european countries are in hardships . 
  why ? 
  generally people who say that there is too much bureacracy and bureacracy is a bad and evil thing can bring no reasons why they think that way . 
  bureacracy is n't there just to fuck with people . 
  it is there so that public management can function with efficiency and professionally . 
  former soviet states have public service with big decentralization and little bueraucracy because soviet union had a lot of them . 
  and look how bad the shape of public management is in those countries . 
  im not saying we should back to soviet model , but completely decentralizing and losing bureacracy just to protest against the past is n't doing any good . 
  why do you think people need to be brainwashed to hate russians ? 
   like trumpie , hrc , xi , dutertie , erdogie and all politic frill fucks on earth , putin is same corrupt as fuck ~ hope all polititian dead alright . . 
  the birth rates are raised by the low-educated group of women who potentially belong to low-income group . 
  so techinally you generate more kids that will grow up in poverty . 
  birth rates are high in underdeveloped and poor countries . 
  it 's common all around the world - see african and asian countries and compare them to european countries . 
  it has many socio-economic reasons .

  the current one has white background and the shape of cyprus on it - does n't have much symbolism and i find it a bit dull . 
  hopefully , they 'll do the same here . 
  i do n't have anything against private russian businesses , but i 'd rather not have a single estonian company 's share owned by russian state enterprises ( which are often used as political tools ) . 
  almost the same in estonia , except that 24th is a full public holiday since 2005 . 
  if only gazprom would sell their stake in eesti gaas because of `` anti-russian '' sentiments , i would be so happy . 
  anyway , it seems that lukoil is completely exiting european retail fuel market , because they 've sold their central european assets aswell . 
  the thing is that most of europe is part of `` the west '' . 
  so naturally they see their own views and values better than foreign ones . 
   stop weaseling and spewing pretentious bullshit . 
  i 'm more just confused by your posts , not `` weaseling '' or bullshitting . 
   you accused me , straight up , of and i quote `` attacking you again '' . 
  you do n't have to constantly quote me . 
  i do n't deny posts , nor do i delete or ( generally ) edit them . 
   you `` commented '' on opinion , utterly ignoring facts presented to you just a few days past . 
  do you mean the corruption case with a finnish company ? 
  because i 've highlighted the importance of corruption in every single comment , so how 's this `` utterly ignoring '' ? 
  it 's the exact opposite . 
   then you commented suggesting that attack on your argument was in fact an attack on you . 
  that 's because i do n't even understand what argument you were attacking . 
  as i 've now stated so many times , i did * not * disagree with you in any of my posts and i 'd surely like a proof of the opposite if you still insist on it . 
  because otherwise , i start to think one of us is crazy . 
   consider not doing that again if you do n't want to look like a pundit pushing a bs agenda . 
  i do n't think i have to fear for that as i 'm not pushing any agendas . 
  uhmm ... okay . 
  in my own opinion , i merely commented on ukraine 's situation because of the op 's doomsday predictions and i did n't even disagree with you , but apparently i 'm now pushing an agenda and denying my own comments . 
  for some reason , i do n't realize that myself , though . 
   that is a direct quote from your post . 
  for some reason , you ommitted the first sentence there . 
   the lack of `` trust '' is not because of outside issues . 
  i have n't even said such thing . 
  i just do n't get what point you 're trying to make here . 
  since i already said i do n't even disagree with your earlier points , i do see your comments as attacking , because you do n't seem to make a point other than just ... arguing ? 
  if you look closely , you 'll notice i mentioned the fact that corruption basically blocks ukraine 's recovery already in my first post , and yet you answered by saying that corruption actually takes most of the costs , so low labour costs would n't help . 
  furthermore , you implied ` cutting wages ' which i did n't say anywhere . 
  talking about false equivalences , huh ? 
  so i really do n't get why are you attacking me here ( again ) . 
  so i do n't get it . 
  because ukraine is corrupt and will probably stay such in the near future , they should just stand idle , not do any reforms , not try to change anything as it 's the reality after all ? 
  if anything , then foreign investments could at least bring some fresh air into the economy where so much money flows illegally . 
  and not once have i mentioned ` cutting wages ' , i only mentioned cheap labour costs which are a result of attractive exchange rate . 
  and this means cheaper costs for basically anything inside the country . 
  that 's why i said that * would * be the case if ukraine was n't a ) so corrupt and b ) in a frozen conflict . 
  both of those should be solved to get economy going . 
  they 're not cutting wages , their currency rate is just so cheap that the country itself is very cheap compared to rest of europe . 
  and that gives a huge boost for tourism , foreign investments and exports , something that ukraine could care a lot about right now . 
  if ukraine was n't so corrupt and did n't have a frozen conflict , they would n't have much to fall anymore . 
  labour force in ukraine is now cheaper than in china or even india ( !!! ) . 
  considering their size , position , natural resources , education etc , they should be the new top spot for relocating cheap industry and services in europe . 
  that 'd require confidence , trust and stability in the country , though . 
  this and that . 
  commieblocks are definitely disliked here and some would like them to be torn down , but that wo n't be happening unless we magically find some hundreds of millions to build replacing living space . 
  so instead , we try to make them tolerable , by insulating them ( energy efficiency was not really a priority back then ) , in better cases improving ventilation and heating etc. 
  new apartments are mostly now built according to their surroundings . 
  a quick search of current developments would give [ this ] ( http://cache.kv.ee/iv2/dev/7_3_7089444.jpg ) in a suburb , [ this ] ( http://cache.kv.ee/iv2/dev/7_3_7053115.jpg ) in a general town area , [ this ] ( http://cache.kv.ee/iv2/dev/7_3_7056573.jpg ) in a wooden house district , [ this ] ( http://cache.kv.ee/iv2/dev/7_3_6714902.jpg ) in a fancy seaside district and [ this ] ( http://cache.kv.ee/iv2/dev/7_3_6717545.jpg ) in a small town . 
  however , in commieblock districts , they do build similar style stuff , like [ this ] ( http://cache.kv.ee/iv2/dev/7_3_5921641.jpg ) , with a bit more humane looks and quality , though . 
  generally , these are fill-in projects and the areas themselves are not expanded . 
  that 's the case for estonia , though , and i assume for latvia and lithuania . 
  ca n't say for others . 
  wait , this district actually looks pretty neat compared to most others . 
  we ca n't answer that . 
  that 's soviet logic for you . 
  germany is in the middle of europe , a wealthy industrialized country whose economy is built upon exports . 
  besides , german wages have actually largely stagnated since , like 2000 or so ( while greek ones , for example , have risen rapidly ) , and their pay is actually one of the lowest among western european countries ( so are the prices , so living standards do not differ so much ) . 
  so in that regard , they do have the low labour cost advantage . 
  anyway , low labour costs are not the only factor and does n't even seem to me that they 'd be the main factor for businesses . 
  i mean , even if i compare estonia and finland , where our monthly wages compare like 1000 $ vs 3200 $ , you 'd expect their businesses moving here . 
  that has not happened in a large scale and we still find more finnish industrial products on our shelves than estonian ones . 
  this despite the fact that we use the same currency , are in same energy market ( same prices ) , are in same trade union . 
  even more , estonia has lower taxation than finland . 
  in long term perspective , we can see that estonian industry is more in an expanding trend and finnish one in declining , so something is happening , but it 's a very slow and hardly noticeable thing . 
  i 'm quite sure most sane people would prefer good relations with everybody . 
  the question is if maybe some other things are more important or is it achievable in an acceptable way . 
  you 're just in a good position because your labour costs are one of the smallest among euro countries , while in finland , they 're one of the highest . 
  you have a long-term advantage in that regard and euro has pretty much locked it to keep it that way . 
  ughh , just because we 're not russians means we should have a negative opinion about them ? 
  i know that . 
  i 've visited finland many times and i generally love the place and people , but i can also be protective about my country . 
  i 'm not saying estonia is better than finland or anything , i understand we 're poorer , less developed etc , but i get annoyed when it 's seen as some poor backwater alcohol store just because some people have n't got further than alko store in tallinn . 
  just why ? 
  it 's even worse in estonia than in central europe , for example , because not only are the houses ugly ( and low quality ) , a lot of these districts have a russian majority as hundreds of thousands of russian immigrants were bought there . 
  so not just brutal and inhumane by their looks , the people living there were foreign too . 
   basically russia . 
  i would n't even care about the first part , but this is just ignorant . 
  not only are they linguistically and culturally very different , but estonia is in the same political , economical and currency union as finland , while at the same time having really bad relations with russia . 
  not to mention that way more finns have boner for russia than estonians . 
  but ... where is greenery ? 
  it 's like they made a huge concrete ground and built houses on it . 
  it seems that central europe has renovated most of the commieblocks , whereas that 's not the case in baltics . 
  i prefer [ simple ] ( http://www.revingrupp.eu/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/rs__4018_s.jpg ) and [ clean ] ( http://www.ekyl.ee/public/2012/urituste_pildid2012/konkursi_voitjad2012/saha_tee2.jpg ) look , or even just having [ same-style balconies ] ( http://media.city24.ee/images/eesti/city_tallinn/mustamae_tee_84/04/9181504/1600x1200/city_tallinn_mustamae_tee_84_img_0909_1446297935040.jpg ) to [ such horror ] ( http://dolny-slask.org.pl/foto/452/452798.jpg ) any day , though . 
  a well-known nazi book that tells how evil jews are conspiracing to take over the world . 
  i do n't think it would have any significant effect in today 's germany . 
  the migrant crisis , however , is a different story . 
  that 's history . 
  should we also be paranoid about sweden , germany or poland invading us as they 've done in the past ? 
  no , because they 've changed . 
  does n't feel like it . 
  that 's in nominal terms , though . 
  we 're just more expensive than czech republic . 
  in ppp terms , they rank better . 
  that 's why i said to compare the countries .

  at least it 's all peaceful for now ... 
  one reason they are so cheap is dutch 2a6 's are really upgraded old 2a4 's so one can probably expect a slightly shorter service life than you 'd get from a new 2a6 . 
  regardless this should be the least someone has ever paid for a 2a6 . 
  oh , get off it . 
  there is absolutely no reason to voice such possibility when there is not a shred of information supporting it . 
  estonia / estonia / estonia would n't rule out a short stint abroad at some point however . 
  lets hope no dane sees this . 
  sounds like a reasonable course of action . 
  so you 're saying it has been long overdue ? 
  you said :  bangladesh , china , vietnam , pakistan , india if you removed them here the shelves would look like it 's the soviet union all over again . 
  perhaps in canada it 's possible to avoid products made in asia but good luck with that here . 
  tbh , greece had political turmoil and riots before ukraine did . 
  just no brotherly neighbour who would use the situation . 
  i figured germany would have something mean but damn haha . 
  or china/vietnam . 
  i think the only pair of shoes i own that were n't made in asia are combat boots . 
  problem is the only reason why companies such as nike are there is because they can underpay and treat the workers shitty . 
  if they no longer can , they 'll just move away . 
  reminds me of the uproar when it came out child labour was being used in ivory coast to pick cocoa beans . 
  many companies stopped and the result was there were more children starving . 
  particularly true about italy . 
  unlike syrians coming via balkans , most african migrants in italy do n't even get a refugee status but would rather stay in europe as illegals than go back home . 
  from personal experience , meeting southern europeans like italians or portuguese who have lived here for a while now is also becoming more and more frequent . 
   we do n't consider descendants of baltic germans to be less estonian do you mean people who are like `` 1/32 german '' or actual ethnic germans ? 
  if you meant the latter , then absolutely not . 
  nor did they consider themselves to be estonian . 
  up until 1940 , many public events like sports competitions would end up in fights between us and the germans . 
  the only good thing about the soviet occupation was that they finally fled . 
  is greece really struggling because of migrants , though ? 
  few end up claiming asylum in greece and most of the supplies distributed in greece come in form of aid . 
  there 's an anschluss joke in there . 
  4 year old thinks lithuania looks like a big penis when the massive dick that is sweden is right next to it . 
  at least it 's not `` shit rectangle '' . 
  germany so powerful , belgium under attack .

  why is kosovo not in the sun ? 
  i would n't be so sure . 
  providing a person lacking marketable skills with everything he needs indefinitely will eventually cost more and that does not account for additional security risks they may pose etc. 
  the difference is some of the money spent on refugees stays in the country .

  the eu could tell us to take a 100,000 refugees and our politicians would still be telling people why this is really a good thing .

   there are currently about 8,000 to 9,000 inmates in lithuania 's prisons . 
  only 300 of them are women . 
  over here , we currently have 2,891 inmates , including 150 women , making it 5,2 % . 
  in lithuania it 's about 3,5 % . 
  i imagine other european countries have similar numbers .

  there are no mysterious forces behind the curtains making fortunes off this conflict .

  relations between ireland and britain today are infinitely better than those between estonia and russia [ yet even a simple state visit from the queen is enough to spark protests and riots ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/picturegalleries/royalty/8518555/the-queen-in-ireland-heavy-security-and-protests.html?image=1 ) .

  [ the situation is nowhere near as bad as crude numbers suggest .

  there is a reason why say a turkish president in greece , an armenian president in azerbaijan , an arab president in israel , an albanian president in serbia or even an english president in ireland would be a no-no for many . 
  every normal russian in estonia with a shred of conscience should understand this much . 
  lets face it , with things being the way they are , there is basically no way such person would n't get conflicted . 
  and even if they somehow did n't , best case scenario it would just be super awkward and cringe-worthy to have such a person give speeches on shall we say more sensitive matters .

  no , not really . 
  older generations use finnish . 
  we could still get finnish tv and radio in soviet occupied estonia , so back then everyone watched and listened to it and learned the language that way . 
  younger generations use english because we all speak it and only a few of us actually bother to learn each others languages . 
  this being said , you can easily learn the language in under a year if you move to the other country . 
  we can also communicate in a broken estonian-finnish-english-hand-gesture language when drunk and magically understand each other perfectly .

   why estonians seeminly rather prefer justifying the pro-nazi collaborationists instead of remembering estonians who fought for the red army , that i really do n't know . 
  that 's because red army in estonia was an occupation army that brought a terror regime here . 
  and i 'm definitely not picking nazi side over soviets in any way . 
  i 'm saying both were horrible regimes . 
  i side with independent estonia only . 
  again , that 's because our nations had a different experience . 
  you 're behaving like the whole country decided to fight with the nazis , while that 's not the case . 
  we 're talking about the fact that more people in baltics fought with nazis , than with soviets . 
  i 'd argue the biggest group of people wanted their independence back . 
  but that opportunity was not given . 
  i can easily condemn those that collaborated with nazis , right here . 
  i 'm saying it was shameful , i am not proud of it , but i 'm merely explaining why it happened . 
  your rhetoric is just something that was used to justify stalinist crimes , when you blame a whole nation for actions some committed under foreign occupation rule . 
  estonia had cultural autonomy for jews . 
  if the nation was all that fascist and nazi or whatever , by what logic did n't any crimes or even discrimination occur during independence , when we held power over own country ? 
  they appeared during nazi ( !!! ), 
  occupation . 
  why 's that simple logic always overlooked ? 
  do you even read what you write ? 
  you behave like every single european country is the same , had exactly the same history and should behave exactly the same way . 
  croatia is not estonia and had absolutey different experiences in wwii and afterwards . 
   well then why did n't poles fight for nazis despite stalin literally declaring war on poland in 1939 ? 
  nazis invaded poland first . 
  by what logic would they side with them ? 
   butthurt detectors are off the chart . 
  you fail to answer my questions and bring one horribly bad example . 
  i think it 's you who are butthurt . 
   anyway , ask the germans themselves what do they think about it and where merkel goes to put flowers on may 9th . 
  germany itself was a murderous nazi regime . 
  the country was basically reinvented after wwii . 
  how can you compare it to baltics in any way ? 
  we have officially declared ourselves to be the same countries as pre-wwii . 
  good for you . 
  our own descendants of dear liberators [ doing what their grandparents did in 1940s ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sg8329uikcw ) . 
  because we merely relocated the monument on the coin . 
  please learn some history before spreading your stalinist bullshit . 
  the reason more people in baltics , for example , fought for nazis was purely because soviets invaded them first , and brought mass repressions . 
  baltic countries themselves were , in no way , somehow pro-german . 
  in fact , baltic germans had been the nobility of estonia and latvia since 13th century , and they lost all their privileges with these countries ' independences . 
  in fact , both estonia and latvia fought against germans in their independence wars . 
  but of course , it 's a great excuse . 
  let 's kill , deport and oppress the people and then blame them for siding with the others . 
  based on that logic , would you also say finland would have deserved to become an impoverished communist shithole ? 
   because of the fact that estonians were evidently more willing to fight as terrorist `` forest '' bands against soviet power even into the 50s , while not doing much against the german occupiers that 's because soviets invaded and occupied independent estonia in 1940 , before nazis even reached here , and installed a terror regime . 
  it 's not a surprise that most people hated them and preferred the other side . 
  blaming this on the nation is incredibly hateful and just wrong . 
   but they stood for 12 years in romania hah , amateurs . 
  soviet troops `` liberated '' estonia in 1944 and last troops left in 1994 . 
  and they say we 're slow . 
  that 's the problem . 
  they were not liberated . 
  vienna , for example , can be said to be liberated , because soviets actually left . 
  warsaw , prague or riga ? 
  nope , just replacing one occupation with another . 
   it 's not like the presidency brings thousands and thousands of people to the country . 
  actually , that 's exactly what it does . 
  estonia has estimated to host over 20 ' 000 guests during presidency . 
  that does n't matter , we still need to host and house a lot of people . 
  because constructions wo n't be ready , we need to find new places for them . 
  the initial budget for presidency was 70 million $ , which is definitely a lot for estonia . 
  you could build something like 10 schoolhouses with that money . 
  i `` like '' how our prime minister needed estonia to act like the teacher 's pet again . 
  he 's completely ignoring that we wo n't manage to finish several important constructions for presidency now , including : * airport track extension * tramway connection to airport * joint ministry building for 4 ministries * knighthood building ( r\u00fc\u00fctelkonna hoone ) on toompea oh well , looks like we 're just gon na rent some new rooms , spending several extra millions for no good reason and having some chaotic times at the airport . 
   perhaps you should take into the account the language you are talking about . 
  finno-ugric languages are some of the hardest to learn for people who speak indo-european , and especially slavic languages . 
  i took a class in finnish , and around 3/4 the people dropped out because it was simply too difficult . 
  then maybe you 'd not pick estonia or finland to become a citizen next time ? 
  i mean , these people can live here all right , but we have no obligation to make them citizens without speaking the language , just because they find it difficult . 
   educating hundreds of thousands of russians in estonian ( for example ) in 25 years is simply not feasible . 
  the only group that is to blame is the government and education system . 
  i know a very efficient way to make them learn estonian . 
  just convert every single russian school and kindergarten into estonain . 
  but we all know that would be furiously protested against by groups in - and outside the country . 
   a very similar situation occurs in ireland . 
  gaelic is taught in an absolutely shitty way . 
  or maybe people find it unnecessary as they already speak one of world 's most spoken languages ? 
   however , the actual demographic statistics of those states indicate that the countries are de-facto ( meaning regardless of right , law , policy , etc. 
  facts on the ground ) multilingual . 
  umm ... like there are many nationalities in the country speaking many languages ? 
  it 's like that in every country in the world . 
  the state itself is not bi - or multilingual if it has one official language . 
  germany has a lot of turkish and arabic migrants . 
  it 's still not a bi - or multilingual country . 
   forcing government representatives to only use a language that a good chunk of the populace ( which they represent ) do not understand is just attempting to ignore a demographic reality . 
  to even be a government representative , you need to be a citizen . 
  to be a citizen , you need to speak the official language . 
  therefore , if there 's information directed at citizens , it 's only logical it 's in the official language . 
  those who do n't understand the official language have themselves to blame . 
  they 've had over 25 years to do that . 
  i answered to your ` ignoring reality ' part of the comment , though . 
  this is called language policy , not ignoring reality .

  it could be a potentially bad situation for the local ecosystem . 
   hunters have seen jackals in latvia . 
  it was expected by zoologists , that due to climate change they would wind up here eventually . 
  same here in estonia !, 
  quite many of them actually . 
  eastern europe . 
  well she would 've done much better if someone had unglued her fingers first . 
  quite simple : luksemburg, 
  around half of our word roots are from a germanic origin . 
  this estimate varies per author , but most of them agree that it 's a lot . 
  saxony ( sachsen ) -  saksa/saksi -  saksamaa ( saxony-land ) also a likely reason why latvians do n't call us estonians , but igaunijas . 
  the old county they used to have the most contacts with was called ugandi in estonian . 
  the name spread and started to mark the entire ethnicity . 
  also , finns call us virolaiset , because they had closest contacts with the county of virumaa . 
  [ ancient estonian counties ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bd/ancient_estonian_counties.png ), 
  i think the issue is more about the fact that many russians here favour the soviet times more and turn a blind eye to the attrocities that were commited then . 
  and it 's not rational , nor is it right to be angry at an entire ethnicity because of it . 
  but this is what you get with `` patriotism '' . 
  you hit the nail on the head there . 
  and it 's weird , because a lot of people may have russian friends and co-workers who they are very fond of , but still be angry against the entire ethnicity , because there are some estrussians who still see russia as a `` saviour '' . 
  in many places it 's extremely difficult to learn estonian . 
  for example , narva , where only 4.1 % of the population is estonian . 
  sure , public schools teach estonian , but not very well . 
  without everyday practice , even the tiny amount they have learned is forgotten . 
  and there 's no motivation , either . 
  they can get a job and live happily with only russian in narva and some parts in tallinn . 
  so why should they go through the extra effort of learning estonian , which is a difficult language for a indo-european anyway ? 
  i get the issue that a lot of russians have . 
  and to a large extent i agree with them . 
  russians born and raised here should get citizenship . 
  it 's not language that 's the problem . 
  not even culture . 
  those who * need * estonian learn it and those who do n't actually need it wo n't learn estonian no matter what . 
  it 's not the language that 's the problem . 
  the problem is with ideology . 
  now if a person born and raised here is against the independence and democracy of this country , then he should not get citizenship , russian or not . 
  it 's not about language , but sadly , a lot of misconceptions about culture , language and ideology make it so . 
  language or cultural background is made a scapegoat far too often . 
  it 's far simpler , i 'm afraid . 
  some people say that a political party pulled some strings , payed some hand-outs and put him up there , because the party was n't eye-to-eye with the paper . 
  ** estonia ** * the culture newspaper sirp got a new editor-in-chief , who nobody likes . 
  this has been going on for a couple of weeks now . 
  this week the next number of the paper came out , which was the first number under the new editor-in-chief . 
  there 's conspiracy theories and shit involved as the newspaper is state-owned . 
  * all the state buildings had estonian flags with black bands hung up to honor the latvians who died in that mall . 
  * snow and mushy snow warnings . 
  to be fair , tea was popular all around the world before colonialists started importing t\u00ea or ch\u00e1 . 
  all you really need for tea is something to give the taste , water and fire . 
  you just boil leaves ( sometimes twigs or berries etc ) in some water and voila !, 
  you have tea . 
  what distinguished between the commonly known tea and the imported tea was that the imported tea was made from tea plant leaves . 
  for some reason the name stuck and started to mark the other types of tea as well . 
  it 's a common thing in language ( onomastics ) , wherein a hyperonym starts marking the entire hyponymy . 
  so it would n't be all so suprising if someone were to actually find some ancient teapots in france . 
  you just got ta know what beer you 're buying . 
  the majority of the brown plastic bottle beers are awful . 
  but some average beers can come in those bottles as well . 
  make sure to pour it into a glass , though . 
  you do n't want to look like a bum . 
  ** estonia ** * the famous christian music group `` s\u00f5najalad '' had a bit of a run-in with the law when one of the sisters refused an alcohol blow-thingy test and later escaped the hospital where they were to take a blood test to see if she was drunk driving . 
  later that day her sister was caught drunk-driving . 
  gossip has it that both sisters are raging alcoholics and some local stores even refuse to sell them booze . 
  in a humiliating interview with one of the sisters , she can be seen shaking and very nervous . 
  obviously she admitted that neither had alcohol problems and that this is all made up , despite her obvious bodily signs indicating recent substance abuse . 
  instead of seeing this as a cautionary tale of the dark side of alcohol , estonians around the country make a mockery of this incident . 
  * the new education reform is confirmed to be fucking retarded as more and more students struggle with financing their studies , because a lot ( who are in need ) have been refused monetary support by the state . 
  before it was being passed , a lot of students protested it .

  i must have also included ( early ) germanic loans as well then . 
  sorry about that . 
  over 40 % of our word roots are from middle and high german . 
  finland , sweden or germany . 
  swedish and german have a culture somewhat similar to ours , which is nice all-in-all . 
  another good thing about sweden is their good , efficient way of doing politics . 
  finnish people are culturally pretty similar to estonians , so it 'd be a nice place to go as well . 
  good economy and governement is stable and not corrupt . 
  i 'm more inclined towards germany because of the climate , though . 
  naming your kids veera is no longer allowed since that name is too popular . 
  i think this rule applies to j\u00fcri and names like that as well ?

  they just wo n't allow it . 
  the russians who are lucky enough to recieve education and support from their families `` estonify '' themselves and move away from russian communities . 
  the not-so-lucky ones remain . 
  what you have is a concentrated amount of angry , poor , unfortunate people whose chances of employement are low . 
  alcoholism is prevalent in the entire country . 
  the ministry of justice attributes the vast majorty of murders and attacks to alcoholism . 
  the ministry of justice also states that the victim of murders is extremely rarely a stranger to the murderer and that it 's usually a personal issue among the murderer and the victim . 
  so the average murder happens between two alcoholics . 
  they drink together , they get into a dispute and one murders the other one . 
  a sad life and alcohol are the culprits . 
  but then a question arises : would they be the same were it not for the eu ?

  it can be translated , but it just does n't sound right in english and it 's definitely used far more often in estonian . 
   also , when we wish good luck to someone , we say `` break a neck . '' ( zlom vaz ) . 
  i 'm sure there are like a thousand variations of this in different languages . 
  '' [ get ] a stone in your bag '' , '' [ get ] a nail in your tire '' , and '' [ get ] a thorn in your throat '' are just some of the variations in estonian . 
  a mother is not always the person , who gave birth to the child ?

  edit : with coordinates !, 
  i have yet to see one in estonia . 
   the amount of nihilism and apathy towards solving problems such as corruption is out of this world for a certain subset of the population . 
  well that is true . 
  i have experienced this a lot as i 've interacted quite a lot with the same social class of latvians as myself . 
  here it is an almost universal criticism of all forms of corruption , while if you talk about this with latvians , the answers are more like `` well , what can you do ... '' you can do plenty if you only have the will to do it . 
  well i more or less loved it as well , but i am a realist , not a romantic .

  it 's not like regular european tourists get this syndrome , only that paris is n't as wonderful as it 's been hyped .

  all it was about was rescuing the tsar . 
  yup , but the tsar extended the contract following them dealing with dimitri . 
  the mercenaries were bolstered by 20000-30000 locals ( moral was rather high after their success ) and sent south against the poles . 
  and we all know how that went   it then dropped down to 1200 men ( de la gardie himself ) after the mercenaries left because they did n't get paid . 
  most of them left literally _ during the battle _ with the numerically vastly inferior polish side ( who 'd surprised them in camp ) . 
  it 's not that they did n't get paid , their monthly wages had arrived with no more delay than usual . 
  it 's that the wages were only partially in actual money , the rest in furs and shit like that , which the mercenaries did n't very much like . 
  they 'd had a bad experience a while earlier when , as they were fighting around moscow , their _ allies _ had looted their camp and taken their shitty so-called-wages . 
  for a mercenary , the only payment worth getting was cash that could be carried around with them . 
  there 's also a theory that de la gardie specifically delayed the payment so he 'd have to pay out less after the battle . 
  when the tide started turning against him he started handing out cash quickly ( effectively a bidding war between him and the poles ) , but he was beaten up by the mercs , lost all of it , and only survived thanks to swedes and finns whom he 'd paid first . 
  whatever else people say about jacob , you 've got to admit he was a fucking _ genius _ when it came to business , 
  that 's a common misunderstanding . 
  the swedes did n't capture moscow , they were invited there by the then-current tsar ( and paid from his pockets ) . 
  first to fight off a pretender to the throne ( one of the false dimitries ) who had moscow surrounded , then to move against the poles who were sieging ... sevastopol ? 
  edit : ... as you might have found out had you checked the wiki page for de la gardie campaign  though the wiki is somewhat incorrect . 
  it states `` 15000-strong swedish military unit '' was involved , though it was actually at most 3000 cavalry and 2000 infantry ( as per the wages requested , probably less in reality ) , and it had only a few units of swedes with the rest being mercenaries from western europe . 
  hmm , protestant work ethic ... it 's just frugal life and ability to work hard being seen as desirable traits . 
  derives from calvinism , afaik . 
  it 's more about the north/south protestant/catholic divide , really . 
  those in the north , used to work land in tougher climes , look down on those in south with their nice weather and easy life -- and enough free time to waste it on a pointlessly flashy version of christianity . 
  roughly : protestant north , catholic south , ordhodox east , with all the associated stereotypes , e.g. 
  `` protestant work ethic '' . 
  there are obvious exceptions , like catholic poland and orthodox greece . 
  any actual religious component is insignificant ; it 's just used in the same way that , say , the beer/wine divide is , or the former iron curtain , or hapsburg/ottoman , or any other simplified method of dividing the continent into easily understandable pieces .

  we 're only ests because that 's what you germanics kept calling us . 
  the demonym we used ourselves , up to quite recently , was _ maarahvas _ -- literally `` land-people '' -- but as _ maa _ has a myriad of meanings in estonian ( including land , ground , countryside , earth , etc ) the closest translation would be `` people who live here '' .

  so enjoy _ idariik _ instead , 
  saxons were pretty big in northern crusades , though , which was the ` official ' introduction of germans to estonians , 
  ... and triple vowels . 
  and quadruple vowels . 
  compound words show no mercy . 
  a third of estonian is second-hand germanic . 
  _ franzos _ was borrowed from old low german . 
  _ - maa _ requires a possessive form in front of it , but that possessive form apparently does n't have to be in estonian . 
  compare our colloquial name for england - _ inglismaa _ , or english-land , 
  close , but _ rootsi _ is thought to have come from roslagen ( same source as rus ' ) , a part of what 's now sweden . 
  compare it to how the finns call us _ viro _ , after one of our northern counties , and the latvians call us _ igaunija _ , after one of our southern counties . 
  that 's an urban tale , though - back when they got the name there were no russians on the other side of lake peipus  it 's from veneti/wends , that is , we call them by the name some of them used before they became russians . 
  have n't met any taanis , but i know some taavis and taalis , 
   the presence of nato forces in poland correction : polish forces _ are _ nato forces . 
  they have eu - _ compatible _ laws . 
  which would be an advantage when it comes to negotiations , and would make fast tracking their application a viable option . 
  what 's inside the signed container is up to you . 
  you can take an used hankie , scan it in and sign the tiff if you wish . 
  then arj the resulting bdoc and sign it again . 
  they do . 
  outside the barricades , over the barricades . 
  first the danes , then you ... 
  german greens are confusing to everyone . 
  they seem to be the firebrand type , people who are incapable of focusing on more than one proposition at a time . 
  and that proposition has , for decades , been `` nuclear bad ! '', 
  japanese might , that 'd explain the weird usage of `` that person '' in translated manga that 's employed to hide the gender of the person indicated . 
  no gendered personal pronouns . 
  no grammatical gender whatsoever . 
  translating from and into other languagues is ... fun . 
  sensible . 
  to channel my inner conservative - if you do n't speak the local languague , you 're cut off from the wider society , and seriously disadvantaged when it comes to seeking employment . 
  if you do n't want to accept government-supported languague learning to alleviate these disadvantages , there 's cause to suspect you 'll be content with sticking to your ghetto and living off welfare . 
  how about we start acting as if ` the ethnic russians ' are some monolithic block , huh ? 
  do you think many of then do n't want to live in a normal country ? 
   you 'll see next to nothing on serious violations of human rights in the country with regards the treatment of homosexuals that 's understandable , in a perverse manner -- they could get sued under the same law . 
  and this time , we wo n't invite either of _ those guys _ . 
   their economy is also structured like a monarchy and not really based on a meritocratic capitalist system . 
  the word you 're looking for is _ feudalism _ . 
   banning olive oil are you perchance referring to the idea that the consumers should be guaranteed the quality of olive oil they receive and not be fobbed off with third-rate product in reused expensive bottles ? 
  voting for party of regions does n't cleanly translate into support for russian option . 
  the latter polled very low even in the east . 
  he did n't do it to punish them , but to be able to better exert control over them . 
  that , and to capitalize on rt brand , 
   i think there are also some reforms and other stuff that eu requires before they would sign with ukraine . 
  not before , _ after _ . 
  the reforms required being mostly of the type that make places nicer to live in in the long run . 
  at least two opposition leaders were asked to report to the prosecutors ' office today to be interviewed . 
  edit : both from the same party whose offices were later raided . 
  edit2 : you can forget about this part now :  a police spokeswoman said neither the regular kiev police nor berkut riot police had conducted any operations at the address . 
  ... as interior ministry has announced that the raid was authorized by the courts due to concerned citizens having reported that stolen computer equipment was used at the premises . 
  not _ the _ opposition , hq of _ an _ opposition party was raided . 
  several media outlets have been getting ddosed badly for past few hours .

  i think it has to do with completely losing trust in our leaders , who fail to fulfull their promises . 
  hence people turn to more radical leaders who promise quick action . 
  why ? 
  i think because we have all forgotten that leaders fulfill promises when there is pressure to fulfill them ... in other words , what will happen to them if they do n't ... and nothing really happens to these leaders these days . 
  after all , they may even get a seat in the eu commission after their tenure is over , far away from their electorate . 
  it 's not like the other side is far ahead in terms of reasonableness . 
  it 's basically `` pro-immigration '' vs `` anti-immigration '' , `` pro-eu '' vs `` anti-eu '' , etc almost all the time . 
  hell , even now with macron and le pen . 
  people wants more change . 
  i already stated the objections below . 
  add brexit to that list , the whole leadership should have gone away the day the results were announced while admitting that their actions and policies influenced this . 
  in a proper functioning world at least . 
  not with the current leadership and course . 
  since we are n't getting a real change in those and will soon get `` more eu '' i ca n't see myself supporting a federation . 
  in a fast-moving world of high technology i do n't see centralization as a boon and i see my ideal europe as an alliance of free nations , that are actually willing to cooperate , not being forced into by `` migrant quotas '' or whatever . 
  but this is an extremely complicated topic , so i think arguing on some sub-topic would probably be more productive . 
  `` this article acts like this putin was a reaction to the oligarchs '' you didnt actually read the article , did you ? 
  it says almost the exact same thing that you wrote : `` the injustice of it all was infuriating for average russians , and they longed for a strongman to restore order . 
  in 1999 , they found one : vladimir putin . 
  rather than restoring order , however , putin replaced the 22 oligarchs with himself alone at the top . 
  from my own research , i estimate that in his 18 years in power he has stolen $ 200 billion from the russian people . '', 
  lepen is definitely not xenophobic or ethnocentric , unless your viewpoint is a pro-mass immigration , pro-globalisation one . 
  you can argue all you want , but that 's just how it is . 
  perhaps , sounds reasonable, 
  nope , my argument is , if the nazi are called far-right and le pen is also called far-right , but lacks the inhumane radicality of the nazis , how can they be called the same ? 
  unless you 're the type of person for whom anyone who wants to cut immigration in any way possible is far-right . 
  that 's the french interior ministry 's figures i think . 
  others are reporting 92 % counted . 
  bullshit , at best they are both hard-right , and when talking about sarkozy that is more of an overstatement . 
  my argument still stands - if she is far-right , then who are the neo-nazis ? 
  the ones that actually support hitler-like policies . 
  you are simplifying politics , nothing more . 
  if spd rules out a coalition with cdu then those greens and linke become pretty important . 
  `` leben '' le pen is most likely making it to the second round , yes . 
  the whole `` le-pen is far right '' is pretty unaccurate . 
  if she is far-right , then what do you call actual neo-nazi movememnts who praise hitler ? 
  they 're the far-right , she is hard-right , as one term goes , at best . 
  i 've seen chiense international news calling her centre-right and fillon - liberal right . 
  `` hillary was never more than a few points ahead . '', 
  while i agree with you in the case for france , this is not what the whole media said before the us election and hence what most people knew and thought . 
  even on election day , and i 've watched most of them just out of interest . 
  and this `` was never more than a few points ahead '' became more common knowledge only after her defeat , when `` some '' people actually started looking at the whole thing more critically . 
  chechnya is also a pretty tribal/clan-focused . 
  other nations have passed this `` phase '' a long time ago i believe . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/teip teip ( also taip and taipa , vaynakh \u0442\u0430\u0439\u043f\u0430 [ \u02c8tajp\u0259 ] : family , kin , clan , tribe [ 1 ] ) is a chechen and ingush tribal organization or clan , self-identified through descent from a common ancestor and geographic location . 
  there are about 130-233 teips ( though some sources state that there may be as many as 300 ) . 
  more than 20 teips originated from newcomers , in particular avars , kumyks , jews , georgians , russians , turks . 
  the taips descending of non-ingush or non-chechen ancestors are called impure teips ( in other language : su ' lijn taipa , \u0441\u043e\u044c\u043b\u0438 \u0442\u0430\u0439\u043f\u0430 ) . 
  a teip 's internal dynamic is based on honor , and blood feuds play a major role . 
  please continue , more great british banter please . 
  `` i do n't think france would go along with that '' france is even more pessimistic about the eu than the british according to different polls . 
  so it might not be that simple . 
  melenchom fading/stagnating ? 
  i guess there is point where he cant sap hamon and probably le pens voters anymore . 
  i am pretty sure i 'm not the only one who does n't give a feck what celebrity supports which politician . 
  i wonder if a whole mass of nutjobs came in support of some politician , would the politician have to reject it for each and every one of them just so he would not be tainted by it ? 
  sounds ridiculous . 
  unless it 's a woman they agree with - then it 's a problem :d oh boy , i remember those arguments in the us election . 
  the same points repeated time and time again , nice try dwb . 
  and of course not a single word about the overall culture of the refugees , not a single word on what their views on women 's rights , gay rights , etc might be . 
  judging by their country of origin and the fact that their women tend to wear religious clothes i say they are all progressive and fit right into europe . 
  also putin and moscow mayor sobjanin style , i reading about those , especially the latter , where one of russia 's more known opposition leaders was participating , and they decided not to attend the debates . 
  i suspect the proposal is of the `` satisfy everyone '' sort . 
  the australian one is n't , because it ' heaivly criticized but it seems to be working with a 90 % descrease in arrivals . 
  once more , there must be political will . 
  australia was heavily criticized for this by organizations and forces who share views with the current governments in major european countries . 
  this is what 's blocking it . 
  it 's because there it is no political will among others . 
  no will = no funds for any project = no project . 
  `` a rescue in the open sea can not be a ticket to europe , because it gives organized crime every argument to persuade people to escape for economic reasons , '' sobotka said . 
  i know that smugglers are a problem , but why ca n't he also add that some people actually want to abuse this `` rescue in open sea '' because it benefits them ? 
  that the demand is there , so supply catches up . 
  it 's a no-brainer for someone who lived in poverty or around people in poverty and understands their mindset . 
  it is quite common that poor people can do anything , abuse any law to get out of poverty . 
  we take as an example and we modify it to our situation . 
  australia is n't exactly small . 
  the main thing about the plan is turning back the boats , strict and unforgiving asylum laws , processing centres where you ca n't just walk out and go roaming all across europe wherever you want . 
  not austria , but you can take this as an example : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/operation_sovereign_borders, 
  and al lthat hasnt been happening in the last 5 years ? 
  i get what you point you are trying to make , but 5 years is not enough . 
  maybe 20-30 years , yes , there i see a bigger problem simply because the muslim population will probable be larger and i dont see anyone who could solve their integration , poverty problem . 
  i think a more convincing argument for melenchon and le pen is that they are both more radical than the others , hence their supporters are probably more angry and enthusiatic about voting . 
  they will come to the polls . 
  will everyone , who says he will vote for macron , actually come and vote for him ? 
  for a banker with a pro-european message ? 
  doubtful . 
  but macrons powerful appeal is that he is neither radical nor the same old establishment candidate ( or has that image ) . 
  serious question - why 5 years will amke a difference ? 
  what exactly will happen in 5 years ? 
  who says that in 5 years there wont be another candidate with a better appeal than le pen ? 
  good observation , i have no idea , maybe he 's a eurocommunist even . 
  literally is n't . 
  `` i am not alexis tsipras , i do n't negotiate for 17 hours with people who offend me , '' told french daily le parisien . '', 
  `` he is n't tsipras , he is worse ! '', 
  - that 's what some are going to say now i bet , cause tsipras 's negotiation basically ended with him accepting the deal . 
  communist france sounds about right :d on a serious note , this small comic reeks of a biased view . 
  its on the same level as `` delusional facts '' , `` racist facts '' . 
  `` criticizing the ysk 's last-minute decision to deem unsealed ballot papers as valid at the start of the vote-counting process '' how exactly is that justifiable ? 
  remember austria , when it was found that if election fraud was technically possible , although not proven , they had a re-run of the election ? 
  i wanted to write that it 's highly unlikely , and i still think it is , but we do n't know whats going to happen in the next 50 days .

  well , is there a thing as `` permit to protest '' in any eu country ? 
  i mean just protest , not riot / ruin others property . 
  i bet these affected by this malware would have rather seen `` ie edge works really good '' ad million times than experience this malware just once . 
   words do n't hurt anyone . 
  stupid people hurt people . 
  not words . 
  could not agree more . 
  things like `` hate speech '' prevent healthy discussions when you get labeled as a `` racist '' immediately . 
  so , is it okay to throw people to prison just because of the n - word ? 
  or because of eating pork in a mosque ? 
  i am not defending russia in no way and in my opinion things are a lot worse there , but it would not make sense to just ignore eu issues . 
  i agree with your points but in russia things are even worse . 
  like i said , nobody is going to jail ( or getting arrested ) in europe for ** just reading constitution ** . 
  do people in europe go to jail for reading out constitution in public ? 
  or they do for things like support of isis , etc ? 
  there seems to be some kind of difference . 
   why 'd anyone want that golden goose go away ? 
  such selfless people . 
  always give away to others . 
  erdogan : wikipedia is fascist , it clearly resembles hitler 's mustache . 
   fucking microsoft and its shit software chances are , that you are using the microsoft 's `` shit software '' at home or even sent this comment using it . 
  i guess that 's why microsoft enforces updates in windows 10 . 
  to prevent mistakes like windows xp * ( nhs uses xp ) * from happening again . 
  no , it has just visa free travel , it allows only up to 90 days per 180 days . 
  georgia is still very far from the schengen agreement . 
  to put it simply , schengen means just no border controls between the schengen countries . 
   put ~ ~ romania , bulgaria , ~ ~ georgia , ukrain , armenia , azerbaijan , serbia , albania , moldavia in schengen just to ~ ~ trigger turkey and russia ~ ~ make sure anti eu parties get more votes . 
  ftfy, 
   sure , also christianity is about pedophiles or slaying orthodox with such a logic . 
  except that besides the westboro baptist church memes and rare occurrences , it does not happen . 
  in islam , it is ** a lot ** more frequent . 
  honestly i do not remember when there was latest christianity-driven terrorist attack , but the latest islam-driven terrorist attack happened very recently . 
  there is also * `` kill them wherever you encounter them , and drive them out from where they drove you out , for persecution '' * . 
   websites spreading some nonsense . 
  sorry , but unfortunately this nonsense is reality . 
  even this op thread is called `` copenhagen imam accused of calling for killing of jews '' . 
   which part can i ask ? 
  there are many of them , for example [ this ] ( http://www.meforum.org/3545/islam-hatred-non-muslim#_ftnref49 ) one . 
  it literally says : * `` o muslim !, 
  o servant of allah , there is a jew hiding behind me , so come and kill him . 
  '' * how it is not anti-semitic ? 
  sorry but how it is related to the `` it skills '' ? 
  which `` it skills '' does 4chan and t_d require ? 
   exploding  blows your mind you are being too obvious . 
   wartorn people  start a war  is ridiculous just makes perfect sense . 
  ** war ** torn people never start a war , that 's why they are ** war ** torn . 
  i guess isis was created by the eu or us , right ? 
  why do you keep omitting / s ? 
  yes , i would even say that their culture is dramatically * exploding * . 
  what can you tell about corruption , equality , consumer rights , etc , in moldova ? 
  moldova would really need to meet all these requirements to be accepted into eu . 
  you could see the requirements ( this link is about turkey but the requirements are the same for everyone ) [ there ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/accession_of_turkey_to_the_european_union#table_of_chapters ) . 
   glorious estonian compared to the russian economy , yes . 
  do you have a newer propaganda script ? 
  this one got too old . 
  yes , it 's like the russian government implements the european hr court rulings . 
  how many times it ruled in favor of the russian opposition ( e.g. 
  navalny ) and the russian government basically ignored it ? 
  usually ad networks like adwords prevent such malicious behavior . 
  could you elaborate what do you mean in  well , we wo n't stop taxing corporations until they only pay out in the country where they generated the profits . 
  more specifically , the * `` stop taxing corporations '' * and * `` they only pay out '' * parts ? 
  how does taxing differ from `` pay out '' ? 
  there is no reason why us would not respond while it is bound by the nato agreement . 
  and there are people like mattis and mccain in us government ( you could also see in news that there is more and more us troops are being deployed in the baltics ) . 
  even if assume that us is not a member of nato ( because it would not respond only in this case ) , i think just eu could handle russia . 
  could you stop your russian propaganda at least for a day ? 
   especially since it 's not going to be a direct attack but a subversive one just like in ukraine it would not matter . 
  us invoked nato aritcle 5 after 9/11 , so what would prevent to invoke article 5 in case of any russian tricks like `` little green men '' ? 
  also , besides nato we have article 42.7 of the lisbon treaty . 
  why ? 
  does not free speech exist ? 
  or it does only if you agree on the subject ? 
   hacker attacks to the baltic power grid allegedely conducted by russian state organizations . 
  and then russians wonder why everyone is `` biased against them '' . 
  sure , there is no reason whatsoever . 
   that 's not an example , that still just a purely subjective feeling arbitrarily linked with a specific number . 
  a specific example would be which particular healthcare expense you consider unnecessary , or could supply more cheaply , and what percentage of tax you could scrap . 
  so , in your opinion , is this situation when government gets 40 % of an employee paycheck , then 20 % of the shareholder revenue , and then it does not forget about 20 % vat , is absolutely okay ? 
  and i am even not talking about electricity tax , land tax , gasoline tax and about other kinds of taxes . 
   no , get it to the corporations : if they stop using tax havens , there 's no need to keep corporate taxes high anymore . 
  they wo n't stop using until taxes are lower . 
  somehow there were no tax havens issue when taxes were lower . 
  what do you suggest to do ? 
  raise tax to 101 % so it will `` teach them '' ( read as unemployment will be 100 % because there will be no companies anymore ) ? 
  balkan states are still very not prepared for the eu standards . 
  i was in serbia recently and corruption is rampant . 
   i 'm completely open to a specific suggestion to cut costs , but just a general vague idea that taxes are too high because your belly says they are does n't carry weight with me . 
  i included a very specific example above about the 40 % effective payroll tax . 
  combined with the corporate income tax , it is just too high in my opinion . 
   so i 'll turn your proposal around : stop using tax havens , and the need for corporate tax will disappear . 
  deal ? 
  yes , that 's what i was trying to say . 
  now need to get it to the politicians , they would need to get it correctly , not as `` close tax havens and make local taxes as high as possible '' . 
   you specifically said easier to start a business , not business in general . 
  yes , it would be easier to start business and more people would motivated to , because nobody wants to start a business and pay a third to the government . 
  existing businesses would also be more eager to grow because government would eat a smaller share of their money . 
   99 % of companies in the eu are sme 's with a turnover of 2m or less though . 
  yes , and it proves my point . 
  this is why tax optimization exists and why its relatively popular . 
   paltry few thousand $ savings .

eurovision 2016 here we come . 
  what have you done for your country ? 
  if you 'll die before the retirement , government will save a lot of money . 
  this message brought to you by ministry of state pensions . 
  not sure if serious ... 
  pretty good map . 
  though it seems there are military zones marked ? 
  why ? 
  imo yes . 
  but i think you would have trouble if you 'd ask if they considered themselves estonians . 
  also we have had russian minority well before the ww2 when old believers came here , though that was in quite small numbers . 
  do you think that \u00c5land inhabitants are ethnic swedes or just swedish speaking minority ? 
  as i said , language with associated culture and self-perception . 
  let 's agree to disagree about this . 
  if i can speak german , that does n't mean i am german . 
  your example is a little extreme and if not entirely hypothetical . 
  i 'll give you a real-life example : during/after ww2 some estonians went to canada and australia . 
  they have their own community there . 
  they can speak estonian even though it 's quite bad as they do n't use it daily . 
  they try to keep their roots by eating estonian cuisines . 
  they teach their children estonian . 
  for me , they are ethnic estonians if they can speak estonian and they have self-perception . 
  they call themselves estonian . 
  some of those people have never been to estonia . 
  i would call them ethnic estonians . 
  in estonian , there is n't really a distinction between ethnic swedes or a swede . 
  this is n't in language nor in culture . 
  and your definition does not make sense for me . 
  they came from sweden , when they were ethnic swedes and they did not develop into distinct culture that was different from ethnic swedes . 
  i would call them ethnic swedes . 
  they were close to sweden , compared your extreme example of india and uk . 
  the were not a colony . 
  for me , weird not to call them ethnic swedes and make a distinction about them , as this sounds like a `` no true scotsman '' fallacy . 
  imo yes . 
  if a moroccan grows up in uk , is he not a brit ? 
  is idris elba not a brit ? 
  is this racial thing ? 
   no , because i speak estonian and have ** cultural identity associated with it **  one part of ethnicity is so called ** self-perception **, 
  no , because i speak estonian and have cultural identity associated with it . 
  which was my point about those people living on that island . 
  they did n't lose their cultural identity nor language . 
  they did n't assimilate and were quite distinct culturally . 
  they had their own dialect but also inhabitants on gotland had that as was the case in other dialects in other places . 
  and if you had asked them if they thought if they were ethnic swedes , they probably would have said yes . 
  one part of ethnicity is so called self-perception . 
  interesting . 
  i have to admit that estonians have a different idea what ethnicity is . 
  from your previous comment :  swedish or swedish speaking ? 
  because there 's quite a difference . 
  what 's the difference ? 
  estonia and ruhnu were under sweden till the great northern war , so after that they went from ethnic swedish status to swedish speaking minority ? 
  if you think that was sad , estonia had [ swedish minority ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/estonian_swedes ) in west estonia . 
   swedish speakers , not swedes . 
  population less than 100 . 
  where did you get that ? 
  from wiki :  according to a census taken in 1934 , ruhnu had a population of 282 : 277 ethnic swedes and 5 ethnic estonians . 
  ruhnu was 99 % swedish before the ww2 . 
  yes . 
  i am from estonia . 
  * finland , ( on a way to sweden , ) * sweden , ( went to ikea ) * germany . 
  ( visited a friend ) i 'm not really a traveling type . 
  i think that was really clever way to show a problem . 
  we need to send you greece to make cutbacks . 
  one cpu cycle . 
  it has been quite awful summer in estonia . 
  quite rainy and temperature is usually between 15 and 21 . 
  there was one week when there was 25-26 . 
  that was nice as it was only time this summer that you could go swimming without getting hypothermia . 
  that was a ploy by cigarette manufactures to propagate the smoking in women . 
  yeah , thats why we didnt have any politicians on our money . 
  i visited germany when my friend was exchange student there . 
  while visiting family 's father asked me if i wanted to visit concentration camp . 
  it was the same camp where anne frank died . 
  no one ever tried to justify nazi 's war crimes and they really expressed sadness and shame for it . 
  i must say they really meant it and i truly think they are only country/people in the world who will admit to their war crimes and i really respect that . 
  that said , i also visited the battleground where battle of the teutoburg forest took place as i am little bit history buff . 
  and people say germans do n't have sense of humour . 
  i got only the german and english . 
  thought norwegian was swedish . 
  though i do n't have much experience in other languages than german . 
  are you trolling ? 
  to me it 's france who used terrorism by blowing up a fucking ship . 
  also the guy who died was photographer not a member of the greenpeace . 
  what 's more they used two bombs , with delay of 10 minutes between them . 
  ira ( now there is a terrorist organization , not a greenpeace which you yourself described as hippies ) used to do that , because onlookers would gather around the bomb site so the second bomb would take out as many people as possible . 
  you do know that person died in that bombing ? 
  but this has a other problem : in the years 2000 to 2013 banks in estonia earned profits of 2,6 billions euros out of 59 millions were taxed . 
  that makes tax rate of 2,3 % . 
  [ estonian source ] ( http://uudised.err.ee/v/majandus/11043944-6a01-46e9-a43d-051e7b08bfdc ) basically banks make money here and funnel it to their homeland , which is the case of the swedbank and other banks . 
  oh , i was n't trying to refute your point , just giving more examples how language can be manipulated . 
  as an estonian i disagree . 
  from wiki  during world war i , due to concerns the american public would reject a product with a german name , american sauerkraut makers relabeled their product as `` liberty cabbage '' for the duration of the war . 
  see also freedom fries . 
  same thing happened in russia during the crimea crisis when [ chicken kiev ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/chicken_kiev ) was renamed . 
  in estonia 's media there was a little debate how we got 44 cv90s for 113 m $ and finns got 100 leopard 2a6s for 200 m $ . 
  only english and estonian . 
  german and russian little bit . 
  this is example of thoughtcrime and fucking stupid to implement . 
  well i did better than i expected . 
  17978 points .

  i assume its all also done under supervision , so there is either someone in the room with you or a camera is looking at you the whole time . 
  also the video they show you is probably culturally foreign . 
  would you get aroused in this situation ? 
  i ca n't imagine anyone , other than some massive masochists get aroused in this kind of a situation . 
  wat r you talking about ? 
  they beat you by 1,6 %, 
  thats some nice trolling , have a upvote xd, 
  look i can understand where you 're coming , but people are going to try to sell you things that are pleasurable to you and what you 'll want to buy again . 
  i 'd also argue that its preferable , since we do n't want to eat food that tastes bland , for example . 
  food is engineered to be pleasurable and for us to desire to consume more of it . 
  texture , fat , salt , sugar , etc is scientifically formulated in a food product to make it `` addictive '' and to the point that its not more harmful than enjoyable , thats fine . 
  we ca n't just go banning things from sale because it might make us dependent on it , otherwise you 're gon na find yourself banning petrol , electricity , water , etc. 
  the measure has to be harm and there is not conclusive evidence that i 've seen that snus should be banned because of that based on our current standard . 
  tbh , i was n't defending the id card proposal that the british government had , rather i 'm expressing amazement that people do n't have that kind of a reaction to online spying . 
  i guess its a case of ` out of sight , out of mind ' , since it is n't as tangible as a physical card with all your info on it . 
  maybe they 're poor because they 're wasting all that money on booze and hookers ? 
  just saying / s, 
  you do know that your online activity will betray everything * except your fingerprints and iris scans * ? 
  i 'd rather have my fingerprints and iris scans taken , thank you very much . 
  you can get addicted to many things ( even things like running long distances , eating , gaming etc. 
  basically anything that creates a affirmative chemical response in the brain ) . 
  its not the addiction thats dangerous , its the effects of addiction . 
  the negative effects of snus are very minor , especially if compared to things like alcohol and traditional smoking . 
  we should n't be legislating based on what is and what is n't addictive . 
  we should only make laws that have a cumulatively positive effect on society and i do n't see banning snus as such . 
  is n't public smoking pretty much illegal eu-wide ? 
  i used to use snus and rarely vape , but i never felt like i wanted to start smoking . 
  i took a puff from a cigarette when i was young and decided it was n't for me and that was that . 
  i also stopped consuming snus entirely and very abruptly , when it came apparent that because of my government 's activities buying snus might start funding criminal organizations . 
  i did n't have any problems stopping using a far more powerful nicotine product than cigarettes and i certainly was n't shaking in a corner fantasizing about getting by next high . 
  fair enough , it is n't the most attractive activity , but that should n't make it a target for laws and law enforcement . 
  especially not criminalization . 
  i would n't put too much stock in these international indexes or polls . 
  they 're rarely anywhere close to accurate . 
  i just gave a map with iceland , i did n't say its a good map :p that said , iirc they [ the indexing ppl ] had an issue with transgender rights in iceland and there was some nitpicky stuff . 
  would n't fret too much about the absolute score though . 
  also , if your 47 % is medieval , where does it leave eastern europe t.t, 
  what i do n't like is that they 're treating alternatives to cigarettes as outright hard drugs . 
  cigarettes ( and cigars for that matter ) are about the most damaging way to consume nicotine and alternatives like e-cigarettes and snus are far less harmful . 
  even if you do n't agree with the consumption of those products , funneling people to the most harmful form of nicotine by making alternatives illegal is plain stupid . 
  alternatives can and would reduce the harm done by smoking as shown by the swedish experience , yet whenever this is raised the anti-smoking lobby close their eyes , cover their ears and scream `` no , no , no ... ! '', 
  to smother any dissent . 
  its outright disgusting to read the articles put out by public relations of the police in my country , making out snus users to be like they 're stereotypical homeless junkies that share needles with each other and rob people to feed their addition , except in this case its snus pads !, 
  all the while ignoring the fact that snus users are typically middle class , socially active and overall normal people . 
  but of course they 'll use their fantasies to criminalize it , waste limited resources trying to arrest ordinary harmless citizens and give a new market to underground criminal groups . 
  for fucks sake !, 
  kurtzgesagt did a video on this : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czgowmtgvgs its amazing how few people are aware how old human civilization actually is . 
  saying its the year 2017 doesnt ' t really help it either . 
  * cough * medvedev * cough * ^ ^ ^ not ^ ^ ^ that ^ ^ ^ theres ^ ^ ^ a ^ ^ ^ big ^ ^ ^ difference, 
  do n't worry , putin-sensei still has elections too . 
  he even does rotations with medvedev-senpai . 
  its the rainbow europe index . 
  it measures social acceptance , discrimination and legal rights in regards to lgbt people , rather than just public opinion . 
  yes . 
  we need this as well . 
  too many young parents have proven to be complete idiots when it comes to rising children , a knock on the door from some men in blue uniforms might just knock some sense into them . 
  just to live up to my flair and to give iceland a place under the sun : http://ilga-europe.org/sites/default/files/attachments/rainbow_europe_map_2017.pdf, 
  tell that to the map :d, 
  you racist scum !, 
  / s ^ ^ black ^ ^ runners, 
  this map makes iceland cry ;(, 
  i remember how our experiment with that ended . 
  `` incorruptible '' they said :\\, 
  yes please . 
  and while you 're at it , also ban regional licensing within the eu . 
  netflix sucks over here :\\, 
  to be honest the infrastructure in southern europe for internet services is lacking already . 
  those investments should 've been made earlier and these regions have had comparatively high prices for some time now . 
  i would n't blame the legislation , but rather the isps who have just milked those countries without making important investments . 
  well ... its actually an old tradition only interrupted by the soviet union . 
  tsars used to meddle in religion a lot and used it for their own ends very often . 
  heck , they were commonly worshiped by common people as well , with shrines and all . 
  stalin also used orthodoxy during wwii for propaganda and his cult of personality took religious forms as well . 
  hmmm ... 
  the more i think about it , the more it seems like its pretty much the status quo for russia throughout the ages . 
  wwii germany definitely was n't `` the most advanced country in the world '' . 
  basically all the major powers that germany fought , even the soviet union , were more advanced on many fronts , especially militarily . 
  quite frankly it was kind of a miracle that germany was so successful during the early period of the war . 
  a miracle made from great incompetence from its enemies , getting many military theories right from the start and a shit-ton of luck . 
  for example the french army was far more motorized and had more tanks than the germans ( even without the british ) , but because the way they used and designed their tanks they were far less effective than the german tanks . 
  the list of significant errors that the french made is very long , while the germans did one specific thing right ( attacking through belgium ) and basically scored a one-hit knockout . 
  plenty , he ordered carpet bombing against western europe , including in parts of occupied france . 
  it was even worse in japan and its often called `` terror bombing '' . 
  killed way more innocent civilians than the atomic bombs did . 
  was n't there a hobo who claimed to be the emperor of california or something ? 
  i ca n't even remember my own age, 
  not cool , dude #notallkeys, 
  estonia/estland/eesti and its derivatives come from germans ( who in turn have been speculated to having been influenced by the romans ) . 
  ancient estonians did not call themselves thus , they saw themselves more as members of their individual tribes ( sakalased , liivlased , ugandi , saarlased , harjulased etc. ) . 
  if they had a broader concept of identity it would most likely have included a far wider group of people , e.g. 
  the northern finnic people : modern-day finns , ingerians , estonians , livonians , vepsians , karelians etc. 
  reason being that their language and culture was more similar and yet uninfluenced by individual invaders . 
  have n't gotten to cut grass once this year . 
  usually we start cutting grass around the beginning of april . 
  got a new lawnmower last year as well :\\, 
  its possible or maybe not exactly as the republican faction from the civil war , but the current flag of spain is the nationalist flag ( or variant of there of ) , which it self is based on a military flag from the imperial period . 
  they might be arguing that the republican flag is more appropriate for present day spain , they might oppose the monarchy or , you know , they might be just doing it for shits and giggles because they 're on the internet . 
  this is nothing compared to the larger issues with e-commerce in the eu . 
  the large players play dirty , but that 's just the tip of the iceberg . 
  its currently nigh-impossible to properly tax all the e-commerce across internal eu borders .

  it means the language environment you grew up in , what your parents talked , how that language built up the way you think , your ancestry , your social norms , your physical appearance etc. 
  yeah , apparently it 's a non-issue and russia is a friendly paradise . 
  serbia , you awake again ? 
  as of 2011 , only 45 % of non-estonians ( i.e. 
  mostly russians ) speak estonian , while 63 % of estonians speak russian . 
  russians , who speak estonian have far better chances on the job market than estonians , who speak russian thanks to that fact . 
  yet , russians are being oppressed ... 
  the citizenship issue will remain . 
  many russians do n't want to take up estonian citizenship because they will not be able to travel to russia visa-free and the men will have to serve 8-11 months in the estonian military . 
  do n't be acting like the serbs did n't start all this . 
  the parents-argument really remains true until the person becomes old enough . 
  believe it or not , there are plenty of such people in europe and the us again , especially among the left-wing millennials . 
  well , should you actually provoke russia , then of course no one should help you , however russia is known for creating illusions of foreign provoking ... 
  why do you also support each other 's crimes ? 
  i 'm not willing to leave one centimeter to russia . 
  narva is a historically estonian town , where estonians were n't allowed to return after world war ii . 
  where does this great love for russia come from ? 
  you meant non-nato aggressor . 
  yeah , especially the `` both parties used this for propaganda purposes '' ... 
  and what town-sized country was that ? 
  the local russians could inhabit the remaining sea part . 
  in the context of `` do you want the 1960s-1980s mass immigration of russians to your country to have happened ? 
  '' , i do n't think the willingness of some russians to integrate in 2016 matters that much . 
  remember that russia protected the russians in crimea from ukrainian reaction to russian-supported separatist violence . 
  in advance . 
  oh , but of course . 
  independent media itself should organize its set of radar stations along nato borders so that we could verify nato 's ludicrous claims ... 
  an age-old russian rhetoric . 
  indeed some of them were lies , either deliberate or not . 
  however such cases did exist . 
  are there any actual reported nato airspace violations of russia ? 
  that 's why russia was called out for being vague ... 
  provide some examples . 
  it 's simple - russian colonists . 
  i did say was :d, 
  understood , but that final emigration would be shown in statistics . 
  if the essence of the party is to impose a foreign dictatorship through violent means , then the party should be repressed . 
   including communists , so it 's more of a similarity than a difference , as the definition goes . 
  what ? 
  democratic socialism is another thing here really . 
  `` by the majority of estonians '' , who imposed a qualitatively better political regime instead of an oppressive communist dictatorship . 
  estonians were n't much allowed to join any other nazi unit ... 
  lol , provoking in self-defense on their own territory ... 
  no , that lame russian rhetoric is a classic . 
  yes , it is important to break the russian dogmas about my country . 
  i 'm not stalking a foreign sub , i sometimes search for estonia-related posts in reddit and they sometimes lead to the russian subreddit . 
  [ yes ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/aug/03/military-aircraft-interventions-have-surged-top-gun-but-for-real ) . 
  ok , that point may stand , but it 's not like those huge numbers of people go abroad to settle rather than work , study or travel . 
  i do n't think i quite get your last point though . 
  i do n't hate russia . 
  i hate russians spreading lies on my country . 
  that 's why i go there . 
  i do n't come there to criticize russia - it 's your own problem . 
  i come there when i see something idiotic about my country . 
   nobody care about your little states in russia . 
   you have to be kidding , that is your explanation for stalking and having more comments on a russian sub lol . 
  no , that is my explanation for not spending time on the estonian sub . 
  now which one 's provoking ? 
  the one invading foreign air space or the one defending their air space ? 
  no , it is not . 
  the most in europe ? 
  probably the balkan countries , especially croatia and romania , as i 've been to most of western europe . 
  also scotland perhaps . 
  the least ? 
  belarus . 
  this place just can not into tourism . 
  drawing an astounding map of europe from the top of his head and yet mixing up estonia and latvia ... 
  i guess i meant that you should n't mock a person for his or her nationality , but can mock a person for his or her religion . 
  yet mocking any nationality or religion itself as well is just plain . . common anyway ... 
  it 's quite a known word among local foreigners . 
  it means `` night '' and is pronounced like [ this ] ( http://forvo.com/word/\u00f6\u00f6/ ) . 
  finns have * y\u00f6 * for that , which is [ pronounced similarly ] ( http://forvo.com/word/y\u00f6/#fi ) . 
  it 's quite uncommon for any europeans to have such a specific name for `` night '' [ it appears ] ( http://ukdataexplorer.com/european-translator/?word=night ) . 
  exactly . 
  so what was your quarrel ? 
  i did n't say changing your nationality is impossible . 
  it 's not attacking anymore when your air space is being violated every so often - it 's defending . 
  if that 30 % would have been equally distributed within the country , things would be different , but right now , this 30 % is living in a very small area : have a look at [ this map ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:share_of_estonians.png ) . 
  lol . 
  it 's been exactly one day since a russian calls me `` butthurt '' and `` victim mentality '' . 
  it rahter seems the butthurtedness comes from your own imperialist dogmas of needing to control other countries , but not being able to anymore . 
  reddit is not that popular in estonia . 
  i can talk to estonians on estonian language web pages , i do n't need an international platform for that . 
  is there some proof to that statement ? 
  if we criticize russia on a certain issue , it is not whataboutism . 
  russians answering to criticism with `` but look at america '' or something else similar , that is whatabaoutism . 
  i suggest you to familiarize with the term before using it . 
  no , i 'm the guy who lets everyone know that the 1st guy is an asshole and should he continue , i 'd whack him in the face . 
  i 'd rather worry about my pension than my culture . 
  the communists were free to run , but not under the name `` communist party of estonia '' . 
  if they were completely banned , they would have gotten 0 % of the votes now , would n't they ? 
  stop getting all nervous now . 
  and it 's not like all members of the party were found guilty of treason or something . 
  some were , on the famous [ trial of the 149 ] ( trial of the 149 ) . 
  the rest could remain active in politics . 
  the communist party of ukraine did n't commit treason only in the last years , it was a long supporter of any pro-russian regime . 
  nothing is up to debate here . 
  communist symbols should be banned . 
  they were symbols of an oppressive foreign regime . 
  i 'd ban them in estonia as well .

   had a walk through the baltics ? 
  is this how we call an illegal occupation this week ? 
   police reports say that about quarter to third of detained were estonian ~ ~ s ~ ~ citizens ftfy . 
  the centre party of course knew how to play with semantics and they claimed that was the share of [ ethnic ] estonians . 
  things have to be pretty fucked up to get a mob of estonians angry . 
  i mean , it did n't even happen when [ russians stormed our parliament during the singing revolution ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-t0nnzi7iec ) . 
  the last time it happened was most likely [ 1919 in saaremaa ] ( https://et.wikipedia.org/wiki/saaremaa_m\u00e4ss ) . 
  well someone did give me gold . 
  thank you , whoever you are !, 
  i sure am glad so many people understand ~ ~ our complicated history with russia and how they manipulate information through their state-controlled mass media ~ ~ the threat that fascism still imposes . 
  you are correct - i thought about it ten minutes before i read your comment :p, 
  that sentiment is still more or less pc in these countries . 
  but of course , nobody considers it as a practical solution . 
   they are descendants of soviet settlers . 
  just out of respect for our [ russian old believer community ] ( https://www.google.ee/search?client=opera&amp;hs=qem&amp;biw=1517&amp;bih=732&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=1&amp;q=vanausulised&amp;oq=vanausulised&amp;gs_l=img.3..35i39k1l2j0i24k1l2.3212.6285.0.6399.14.13.0.0.0.0.216.1257.4j4j2.10.0....0...1c.1.64.img..4.10.1253...0j0i30k1j0i5i30k1.vd4ebrcowiu ) , definitely not all of them . 
   a lot of desinformation like monument was blown up / sawed in half i remember some old lady showing a large s-shaped imaginary sawing line on the monument to a russian tv channel . 
  never mind that the monument was not in pieces at the time and it would have meant that the estonian government must have glued it back together somehow . 
  only local waffen-ss , which were later cleared of criminal connotations and they even guarded nazi criminals during the nuremberg trials . 
  you mean , people , who were forcefully mobilized into the red army , which was a crime against international law as you can not mobilize people from occupied territories . 
   honestly , female hygiene products confuse me . 
  omfg , i made a terrible mistake - ** these are n't tampons , but [ sanitary napkins ] ( https://www.selver.ee/hugieenisidemed-invisible-ultra-libresse-20-tk ) ** : s, 
  from [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/asylum_seeker )  an asylum seeker may be a refugee , a displaced person or a migrant , such as an economic migrant . 
  from a multitude of countries with a smaller share from the total number ? 
  the riots actually took place over several nights in several towns with bigger russian populations ( i.e. 
  j\u00f5hvi , narva , kohtla-j\u00e4rve , and kivi\u00f5li ) , but of course it was mainly in tallinn . 
  there being a small number of ethnic estonias ( or finns or berbers for the matter ) does n't change the fact that the protesters were overwhelmingly russians and other russophone people . 
   this event revealed the strong divisions between estonian-speakers and russian-speakers in estonia . 
  plus i think it sort of divided the russian population as well . 
  just like with the lenin 's statue in tartu . 
  there was a sitting monument to lenin at first , but it was blown up by estonian resistance . 
  then they replaced it with a standing monument . 
  needless to say there arose a saying : `` at first he was ~ ~ standing ~ ~ sitting , now he stood up , and soon he will leave for good . '', 
  which he did . 
  not that bernie sanders is a socialist himself ... 
  because it suits them politically . 
  people in these countries are rather left wing , but the support for far left parties drops sharply , so being `` left-wing '' usually means being social democrats . 
  the party may have also gotten its name due to a historical development . 
   seems pretty dumb to take down a statue devoted to the millions who sacrificed themselves to make sure you do n't live under nazi rule today . 
  what if i told you that the soviets were worse than the nazis in this country and they occupied the country before the nazis ? 
  imho this `` memorial to brave victims '' should have been moved to the museum of occupations and put up next to a nazi monument . 
  at least [ these guys ] ( https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/locationphotodirectlink-g274958-d281978-i75862065-estonian_museum_of_occupations-tallinn_harju_county.html ) now have a role in guarding the toilets in the museum of occupations . 
  edit : plus it stood at a [ rather prominent site ] ( https://www.google.ee/maps/@59.4313274,24.7387196,3a,75y,117.01h,92.49t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1spfbogxwykoxaboba4p1how!2e0!7i13312!8i6656 ) before . 
  one person died and 0.1 % of the national population was arrested . 
   i suppose there is no evidence that all this people were actually russians , and not only passing opportunists ? 
  yes and no . 
  of course all of them were n't universally russians ( or russophone non-russians ) , but they were still overwhelmingly russians . 
  initially the pro-russian party tried to claim that a lot of them were actually estonians , but it was a good semantic trick as they referred to the share of estonian citizens , of whom also most were ethnic russians . 
  i 'm quite sure the sprite was also for the lady . 
  the sprite and tampons may be gone by now , but love - love remains . 
  you may find a better answer at r/sarcasm . 
  because trump having changed his russian policy a bit proves that russia did n't try to get him into office over clinton ? 
  shut up , he was protesting against fascism !, 
   `` everything belongs to us ! '', 
  ah , the famous anti-fascist slogan, 
   on the other hand , good job costa rica and estonia !, 
  12th place is good , but we ( and everyone else at the top ) had a better score a decade ago and were in top 10 in 2006-2012 and 2015 . 
  no , this map connects the corded ware culture exclusively with indo-europeans and the map shows them living in estonia and southern finland . 
  even though corded ware culture definitely spanned here , i have n't really heard it bringing an indo-european population here . 
  i mean , does it claim that there were indo-european peoples here before the finnic people ? 
  they are n't even run by socialist parties per se , even though their name might be `` socialist party '' . 
  every year on 9 may ethnic russians ~ ~ organized a hostile event where they recreated a soviet-era atmosphere , yelled anti-estonian slogans and tore down estonian flags ~ ~ commemorated the end of world war ii in europe , when the estonian government decided to ~ ~ move the pivotal bronze soldier memorial ( which was a symbol of occupation for estonians ) to a military graveyard ~ ~ tear down a memorial to the brave red army victims of the war , so the ethnic russians ~ ~ started to loot , destroying a lot of property in the city ~ ~ rightfully protested against fascism , and russia ~ ~ operated a covert network of cyber-attacks against estonia , bringing down many crucial government sites ~ ~ was worried about the persecution of ethnic russians , the rise of fascism , and the rewriting of history in estonia . 
  it has been 10 years since the [ bronze night ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bronze_night ) riots in estonia . 
  tomorrow marks 10 years since the first [ cyber-attacks directed at an entire state ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_cyberattacks_on_estonia ) . 
  it is so often like this - politicians get blamed for all sorts of bullshit , while their real mistakes are disregarded . 
  something like 80 % of the people do n't understand that scandinavian countries are n't actually socialist countries . 
  you could split the governorate of livonia though , it consisted of two linguistically different areas anyway . 
  that 's a little inconsistent , do n't you think ? 
  these three are the historical provinces of the land and they are bigger than some other provinces on your map . 
  indeed :  153 . belarus  155 . turkey  157 . kazakhstan  162 . azerbaijan, 
  but why not use the historical provinces of estonia and latvia ? 
  the [ governorate of estonia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/governorate_of_estonia ) , the [ governorate of livonia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/governorate_of_livonia ) , the [ governorate of courland ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/courland_governorate ) ( i.e. 
  `` provinces '' ) come to mind . 
  was corded ware entirely indo-european ? 
  because that would sort of rewrite the histories of estonia and finland . 
  is it weird when your city has a wallpaper ? 
  what about with the eyes in the back of your head ? 
   12 . estonia it sure is a long way from 1991 . 
  is it even possible not to learn a foreign language in school ? 
  i do n't think it is here . 
   seriously feel bad for the girls who have to put up with the type of american soldier who think he owns your country when there there is no such stereotype . 
  for reference , [ this ] ( https://et.wikipedia.org/wiki/kaibaldi_liivik#/media/file:kaibaldi_n%c3%b5mm.jpg ) is the biggest sand area in estonia . 
  correlation is the line you see on the graph . 
  it is not about `` seeing '' something . 
  you should look [ here ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/correlation_and_dependence ) . 
  so you think that in order for there to be a general correlation , every single actor needs to have a higher y-value than all actors with a lower x-value ? 
  the correlation is very apparent - i do n't know how you even got to the opposite conclusion . 
  but this graph does use very old data ( many post-socialist countries are way behind greece and portugal ) . 
   according to the ethnicities page there are only 24 % russians . 
  30 % are russophone people , but it also includes mostly russified ukrainians and belarusians . 
   is a minority of 24 % a good reason to call estonia `` eastern european '' . 
  i fail to see a causality . 
  definitely not . 
  however i do n't think this is the reason here , it 's rather just the usage of cold war era definitions for some countries and geographical/cultural regions for others , which makes it rather biased . 
  that could very well be it . 
   and even estonia ( obviously can not into nordics in this graph ) consider the [ 30 % russians ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/religion_in_estonia#/media/file:religious_differences_in_estonia.png ) . 
  why do you people always forget that ? 
   someone used some veeeeeeeeeeeeery broad definitions of european regions :-) because everything post-socialist = eastern europe for these people ... 
  i agree that these countries are eastern european when you divide europe into western and eastern europe based on the socialist history factor , but if you include regions like northern europe and southern europe , then such a broad definition of eastern europe is just biased bullshit . 
  edit : plus cia world factbook is a horrible place to get gdp data . 
  that 's very sweet of you , northern estonia !,

  i thought we were just fearmongering ? 
   eastern europe does whatever is worst for russia . 
  lol  western europe simply does n't care about russia all that much nice not to care if it 's not your country under a direct threat of invasion . . 
  perhaps these countries are not satisfied by how italy and greece are dealing with illegal immigration ? 
  you want to send immigrants to the north , we already have 30 % immigrants from our population ... 
  saudi arabia is not really an existential threat to fellow european countries ... ca n't see those double standards here . 
  actions like these and the strongman image is what keeps internal discontent down . 
  in normal countries such economic harshness would have resulted in a change of government much sooner . 
  you do n't get how imperialism is still ingrained to the russian mentality . 
  also foreign policy victories like that are important for dictators to suppress internal discontent . 
  seriously ? 
  what world do you live in ? 
  it 's nice to play friends with a corrupt dictatorship that has been tormenting half the continent for a century if not more , right ? 
   have you any idea what russia went through in the 20th century ? 
  civil war , purges , gulag , nazi genocide , cold war , arms race , communism , communism collapse , yeltsin , default . 
  you forgot the new dictatorship era . 
  also the extraction of gas and oil has really deprived any chance of development in other parts of the economy . 
  so does eastern europe . 
  question to moldovans - why do you still care about this region ? 
  i mean , when moldova was cut away from romania and annexed into the soviet union , then transnistria was not part of moldova . 
  it 's not your historical territory , so why care ? 
  bloody hell ? 
  reminds me of [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t65swzhabes&amp;t=96s ) . 
  what 's the most retarded about this is the policy of the new estonian government ... 
  why the fuck would they blame themselves ? 
  do you think the french or the polish people will blame themselves for the nazi occupation ? 
   lithuania , just like latvia and estonia are eastern european . 
  deal with it . 
  i have no complexes about calling myself eastern european . 
  could you be less unintelligent ? 
  i 'm sorry to confuse you , but eastern europe is part of the western world ... western world = / = western europe, 
  there are n't visible differences between northern european countries and southern european countries ? 
  calling half the continent eastern europe and not by their actual corresponding regions makes just as much sense than dividing europe between the formerly nazi europe and non-nazi europe ... 
   perhaps cuturally was n't the right word , but please , you were part of the communist sphere of influence , the moment we actually started making the clear political distinction between west and east . 
  yes , but why make such distinction today ? 
  you actually claim our culture is `` eastern european '' ? 
  what the hell is that even ? 
  could you be less unintelligent ? 
   finland is russia . 
  the baltics ? 
  well , who knows . 
  they need to make up their mind . 
  yeah , we have pretty much made up our mind , yet there are ignorant guys from sweden mixing up the concepts scandinavia , nordic countries and northern europe ... 
  in a context they are , just do n't go and spread around this ignorant concept in any context . 
  thank the russians for that . 
  latvia and lithuania do n't claim to be nordic countries . 
  plus , you have to give it time , soviet occupation has had a huge effect on the people and despite how hard we try to get rid of it , it wo n't happen overnight . 
  plus estonia has a lot of russians and 51 % of ethnic estonians recently supported same sex marriage . 
  wow , this guy . 
  i am saying it was only a part of the soviet union in their twisted interpretation of international law . 
  dude , it 's reval or revel , not ravel . 
  hey everybody !, 
  keep away - they 're just [ building factories and kindergartens ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t65swzhabes&amp;t=1s ) . 
  me too , that 's why i made the joke . 
  estonia would be radically different without finnish television though . 
  it 's what kept our mentality western throughout the soviet occupation . 
  not to mention the invasion of afghanistan is generally seen as a legal operation , quite unlike the occupation of the baltic states . 
  just had a taxi driver like this . 
  i was too drunk to get into an argument , but damn i wanted to say that he could always leave if he wanted to ... 
  can you really be a part of something not existing anymore ? 
  and estonia was illegally occupied by the ussr , not a legal part of it . 
  we will accept with our superiour knowledge of the lannguage . 
  estonia as well and probably the entire northern europe . 
  i think i 've never seen that . 
  you ca n't really buy a coffee in the morning if you 're coming from the suburbs or from a residential area . 
  nothing is open in these neighborhoods so early . 
  and people either drink at home or at work , or both . 
  / r/russia has banned you for hinting towards an unsanctioned direction . 
  tallin ** n **, 
   tallinn genuinely is pretty much like riga , only smaller i 'm sorry , but this is an idiotic statement . 
  / said by someone , who goes to riga about twice a year and loves the city . 
  / r/eesti declares neutra ... and gets invaded by / r/russia . 
  the baltics were not really part of the ussr to begin with , they were illegally occupied sovereign states . 
  public saunas are almost always big , private saunas not so much . 
  most start their day by drinking a coffee at work in my experience . 
  most start their day by drinking a coffee at work in my experience . 
  a post about estonia a day keeps the posts about latvia away . 
  at least not from home . 
  we have the same negative reaction based on how southern europeans act . 
  it all seems just loud and rude . 
  that 's mostly a thing in sparser , suburban areas in my experience . 
  and it does happen all around northern europe . 
  haapsalu is a summer fling thing indeed , but it 's not particularly richer because of it - it has basically nothing going on in the winter . 
  hiiumaa has actually always been surprisingly industrial , so that 's most likely why it is richer than most of estonia . 
  lithuania is also the only one of the three to not have huge stocks of russians immigrants ... 
  that indeed . 
  they wo n't after our leftist government implements its high tax on alcohol . . 
  nou , wi spiik better inglish t\u00e4n t\u00e4tt, 
  poor latvia , what happened ? 
  is bauskas really that tasty ? 
  saaremaa is probably barely over the green colour line - hiiumaa however is a bit richer than the estonian average indeed . 
  he is still the mayor ( as in this guy will never step down from anywhere ) , he is just temporarily suspended from the office by a court decision . 
  you really do n't get why holodomyr is considered to be a genocide ... 
  almost half of estonia lives in the light green area , not even in the main green area . 
  were the famines caused by churchill ? 
  luckily such a person would be de facto alienated from the society here . 
  estonia is gray , just like our souls . 
  i 'm actually not against this . 
  our internet is slower than yours if i remember correctly . 
  depends on how much you drink .

  look out for guys with hair . 
  it 's as if these people did n't notice . . 
  exactly , that 's what the hype is all about . 
  it still keeps snowing in tallinn , we currently have about [ 15 cm of snow ] ( http://www.ilmateenistus.ee/ilm/ilmavaatlused/sademed/lumekaart/ ) . 
  oh we have that thing too , it 's called `` summer '' . 
  we did n't have our [ old women 's summer ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/indian_summer#similar_phenomena ) this year ... should i sue ? 
  yeah , we more or less do ... 
  what a nice way to discredit the anti-sunday shopping agenda , by including themselves in the discussion . . 
  indeed , just do n't leave it on the very last minutes , the cashiers wo n't appreciate that !, 
  sure , but there will be a lot of 50 % off goods that are good for another day . 
  why would n't it ? 
  oh boy ... not as if you had the biggest military in the world and the biggest economy of all democratic countries ... 
  jesus f. christ , the naivety is strong with this one . . 
  some completely disillusioned people indeed . 
   we all know at least one our grandparents votes for them . 
  not mine ...  but with the one footed pirate kicked off his throne , it would be kind of interesting to see what would change ( if anything ) with an almost new-look government . 
  it 's as if the centre party has radically changed their ideology in a few days ... 
  i just ca n't get the logic behind this move . 
   estonian shitposts with pretty picture there are pretty pictures from all over europe here . 
   or the stupid `` nordic '' meme . 
  have n't really seen such * posts * here . . 
  well yea , but i as a customer really should n't care about that . 
  i care about which one is open on the particular time i want to go shopping . 
  works the same way with different closing hours as well . 
  today saw dozens of people riding a bike to work in a blizzard . 
  yeah , for ethnic estonians it 's often the `` i do n't know anyone , who knows anyone , who votes for the centre party '' sentiment . 
  they have a pretty good opportunity to not open shop every day of the week if they do n't want to . 
  depends on the time i guess . 
  on work days i often shop after 10 pm to avoid the crowds . 
  well , perhaps then . 
  i ca n't imagine many people in estonia opting for that . 
  oooh yes , but their pro-russian chairman was ousted on saturday . 
  i doubt there are many who would choose getting home at 9 pm and resting in the middle of the day ... 
  do you have a problem with the dots or with the shortened year ? 
  does anybody actually still look at this in the religious way in europe ? 
  nobody works 7 days a week because of sunday shopping ... 
  i love it !, 
  fewer people around me . 
  consider that you have to remain at work for three extra hours because of that long break ... 
  ah , three tracks driven in the snow , two lanes in opposing directions . 
  a very typical country road . 
  so two days after the controversial ** [ edgar savisaar ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/edgar_savisaar ) was ousted ** from the position of chairman of the long time pro-russian political pariah [ estonian centre party ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/estonian_centre_party ) , with whom all mainstream parties refused to form a coalition together , the social democratic party and the conservative pro patria and res publica union ( irl ) decided to ** oust the estonian reform party from government ** , where they have been for ** 17 consecutive years ** . 
  they now plan to enter into a ** coalition with the estonian centre party ** , offering its new leader , j\u00fcri ratas , the position of prime minister . 
  their argument was that estonia needs a fresh government and it is important that the new government stay `` patriotic '' and that the national security issues will remain of paramount importance . 
  it is ironic because the estonian centre party has been anything but patriotic and has an often disagreeing view about national security issues , at least according to basically all mainstream parties . 
  it is as if the new chairman has suddenly changed the nature of the party , totally forgetting that it still includes several soviet-minded top politicians ( like [ yana toom ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/yana_toom ) ) and most of its electorate are ethnic russians . 
  in my opinion the decision will mark the demise of the irl as [ it has been losing support for a long time already ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/63/estonian_opinion_polling%2c_30_day_moving_average%2c_2015-2019.png ) . 
  i honestly ca n't see what kind of conservative estonian voter would vote for a nominally conservative and patriotic party that enters into a coalition with social democrats and with a pro-russian party ... 
  the banks of daugava looked very different the last time i visited riga . 
  estonian , english and german , plus a little russian . 
  an obvious hyperbole . 
  it will be done , my lord !, 
  who said i discriminate anyone ? 
  who said those who do not discriminate do n't hate ? 
  who said those who hate do n't have basic respect for life ? 
  do you want us to sack sigtuna again ? 
  you !, 
  i like you !, 
  great student town , lived there for 7 years , now i long for it so much that i visit it every other weekend from tallinn . 
  i 'm pretty sure that has never been a serious idea . 
  and i do n't know what fairy tale world you live in . 
  lol, 
  i 've been banned for less . 
  more or less , but it 's not pc enough for this sub to think like that . 
  no good story has ever included paldiski . 
  well , portuguese does sound a bit like russian . 
  i personally am very affected by riga , so i go there once or twice a year . 
  i 've been there over 15 times i guess , even more than in helsinki , which is probably the most boring place in finland . 
   you do n't want to show russophobia , no ? 
  yeah estonians are probably the last people on earth to care about that . 
  some [ southern estonian dialects ] ( http://i.imgur.com/dirq9fb.jpg ) are so different from standard estonian that it 's almost impossible to understand anything . 
  v\u00f5ro is very difficult to understand and seto is basically alien for me . 
  most of the other dialects have mostly died out because they are similar enough to standard estonian . 
  [ here ] ( http://hightimetoawake.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/islam-map.png ) 's one . 
  some post-socialist states had religious revival ( poland , lithuania for example ) , some did not ( estonia , czech republic , eastern germany ) . 
  you too , there are luckily so few in estonia , who think like that . 
  you really are among the minority then . 
  not much baltic about estonia , dear finn . 
  pretty much world peace . 
  wo n't happen any time soon though . 
  you mean [ this ] ( http://valisministeerium.ee/sites/default/files/content-editors/old-theme/pilk2009/tln-turg.jpg ) ? 
  well all estonians know what [ this ] ( https://www.google.ee/maps/@59.3524372,24.6288613,3a,47.8y,216.72h,96.79t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1si71tjdmiynwxdlsbmxec-g!2e0!7i13312!8i6656 ) stands for . . :d, 
  tallinn must be one of the least car friendly cities in europe ... 
  [ most of the old town ] ( http://ct.vanalinnaselts.ee.ct01.greendrupal.org/sites/default/files/imagecache/full/tallinna%20parkimise%20korralduse%20arengukavas%20aastateks%202006-2014%20esitatud%20vanalinna%20jalak\u00e4ijate%20ala%20laiendusettepanek.jpg ) ( in green ) actually is a pedestrian only area . 
  trust me , you would n't have enjoyed it as much in the summer , there 's really no room in the old town because of the tourist masses . 
  that 's close to the average estonian sentiment towards russians for you ... 
  sad , but it 's often just like that . 
  yet luckily the old town was more or less salvaged or restored . 
  narva and most of the ida-viru county are sort of the `` internal abroad '' for estonians . 
  not to mention that the former majority ethnic estonians were not allowed back to the town after wwii ... 
  [ this ] ( http://images-cdn.9gag.com/photo/azeokwb_700b_v1.jpg ), 
  oh do n't worry , estonians and finns both really send the worst of their sons to visit each other . . 
  tallinn , riga and vilnius really do n't compete with each other , they are so utterly different in their architecture , history and size that each one offers something different for tourists . 
  riga is the cosmopolitan art nouveau capital with a very beautiful central town , vilnius is the baroque beauty and tallinn is the medieval fairy tale city . 
  they say that it 's not snow that 's dangerous , it 's [ black ice ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efiw2k8gasm ) . 
  estonia complains , russia denies , that 's your average thursday really . 
  lol , it may not stay for long , but it probably wo n't melt in a week or so , because a cold wave is predicted ( -14 for saturday morning ) :d, 
  snowed quite a lot in most of estonia and does n't seem to melt it seems . 
  oh , edgy teenager discovered ... 
  english is my third language after estonian and german .

  none of the portuguese characters on the map ? 
  because \u00d5 is an independent letter of the estonian alphabet . 
  they are usually shown on estonian keyboards on the same keys with s and z so the use of `` sh '' and `` zh '' is rather awkward . 
  ok that esthland sign has been used way too boldly . 
   apparently estonia really ca n't into nordic . 
  * quelle surprise * , the soviet occupation + russophone immigration affected our social values . 
  you just ... 
  multiple letters are life !, 
  they decide whether the vowel is short , long or over-long , 
  oh do n't worry , [ we 've got it covered ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/oil_shale#/media/file:production_of_oil_shale.png ) !, 
   we do it so our writting does n't look estonian . 
  your overuse of - as , - is , - us etc suffixes already handles that , 
  the pronunciation is different though . 
  in estonian it 's the [ mid back unrounded vowel ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mid_back_unrounded_vowel ) ( listen [ here ] ( https://forvo.com/word/\u00f5/#et ) ) , while in portuguese it 's the [ close-mid back rounded vowel ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/close-mid_back_rounded_vowel ) ( listen [ here ] ( https://forvo.com/word/\u00f5/#pt ) ) . 
  plus in portuguese , it 's not considered an independent letter of the alphabet . 
  * \u0161a\u0161l\u00f5kk * - shashlik * \u017eelee * - jellie ( as in `` gelatine dessert '' ) both are loan words of course . 
  both \u0161 and \u017e are considered `` foreign letters '' only used in foreign names and loan words . 
  which is true , i think i even mentioned it in some other comment . 
   which implies that the lines are there purely to show the difference/similiarity in the languages well this much we all get , but that they only chose some language relations to examine is not something you would automatically grasp by the looks of this chart . 
   \u0161 -  german `` sch ''  \u017e -  first sound in french jean exactly the same in estonian . 
  also \u00e4 , \u00f6 and \u00fc are sort of same in german as well . 
  only [ \u00f5 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/\u00d5#estonian ) is our special snowflake . 
  baltic german dialects were indeed a separated subgroup of the lower german dialects . 
  you can see the different germanic origins in the link provided in my original comment . 
   -- people care about which languages are connected , but connections only show which pairs of languages were measured , not which are supposed to be most similar but this is sort of . . not given !, 
  that might be true , however i tend to believe we still have more connecting words with germanic languages than common latvian loans from germanic languages . 
  but this is a guess , i ca n't be sure without some numbers . 
  they are all finno-ugric languages , a subbranch of uralic languages . 
  we 're just small so you ca n't see . 
  it 's still a first-order subject , i.e. 
  the only language within a small language family . 
  if there are different language families here already , with their languages interconnected , then basque should be included . 
   i did n't decide this . 
  linguists did . 
  argue about it with them . 
  quite high and mighty . 
  i do n't argue over its lack of `` evolutionary-linguistic connection '' with any live languages , i 'm just claiming it should be included , with connections to languages of other language families , just like with the different language families already included here . 
  the difference being that there is only one language in the language family . 
  there is no reason to leave out isolates if different language groups are already shown as interconnected . 
  basically my comment under the previous chart still applies :  again rather random as estonian has like [ 40 % germanic word roots ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/21/estonian_vocabulary.png ) and only about 5 % latvian/baltic ( + vice versa influences ) . 
  there is also no special lexical relation between estonian and hungarian , so i do n't see the reason why hungarian is linked with estonian , but not with finnish . 
  sure , but if we considered these words , plus political and philosophical concepts , then english , greek and latin would dominate these lists . 
  but these are not common language words in that sense . 
   in spanish the word for computer is just a borrowed word made spanish by adding '' + ador '' but the finnish word is tietokone ( roughly looks like `` knowledge machine '' ) and in estonian it 's the same as the previous word for `` calculator '' ( * arvuti * ) as the word for `` calculator '' was quickly replaced with the word `` pocket calculator '' ( * taskuarvuti * ) or `` calculator '' ( * kalkulaator * ) . 
  and so ? 
  what other type of connection is there ? 
   uralic languages are equally connected to , german and to greek for example . 
  but what else is that connection related to if not vocabulary ? 
  an isolate is still a language family . 
  or finnish and greek . 
  or russian and greek . 
   and afaik none of those languages are isolates , correct me if i 'm wrong here no , but why is that important here ? 
  there are lines between different language groups already . 
   estonian and latvian are similarly unrelated but their lexical distance is affected by their proximity and shared history . 
  yes , it works in three ways mostly : - estonian-latvian loans from each other ; - latvian loans from livonian , which shared word roots with estonian ; - estonian and latvian common loans from mostly germanic , but also from slavic languages . 
  which in this case should exclude denmark , iceland and the faroe islands , right ? 
  and the smell , and the russian youths throwing the shells everywhere ... 
   scandi languages ( minus finnish for obvious reasons ) that reason being that finnish is not a `` scandi language '' ? 
  again rather random as estonian has like [ 40 % germanic word roots ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/21/estonian_vocabulary.png ) and only about 5 % latvian/baltic ( + vice versa influences ) . 
  there is also no special lexical relation between estonian and hungarian , so i do n't see the reason why hungarian is linked with estonian , but not with finnish . 
  different tag games . 
  for which ones ? 
  [ this ] ( http://usin.ee/wp-content/uploads/praetud-kotlet-kodune.jpg ) is a * kotlet * - they are rather larger than meatballs and not shaped like balls . 
  definitely not as popular . 
  here `` frikadelle '' ( * frikadellid * ) are small meatballs that you put into frikadeller soup . 
  `` meatballs '' ( * lihapallid * ) are rather larger and you eat them on the side of dishes . 
  estonia and lithuania - [ local variety of garlic bread ] ( https://titeblogi.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/img_1045.jpg ) ? 
  gosh , i remember the 1990s and how public transport was filled with sunflower seed shells in the russian majority districts of tallinn ... 
  because it 's technically not ketchup ? 
  general observations can give you a good view of how well a country is doing . 
  but overemphasizing a single better or worse than average result can lead you to erroneous conclusions . 
  ketchup is a no-no , while pineapple is wonderful on pizza !, 
  i do n't care if i survive the coming winter . 
  indeed , then finally the entire sane world would consider the ussr as an evil imperialist power like they consider nazi germany to be today . 
  latvia had a lot of jews . 
  proportions matter , not just total numbers ... 
  which part of that `` eastern europe '' ? 
  not all countries had many jews . 
  instead of colouring some arbitrary regions , perhaps share of total population would have been more informative ? 
  i am aware of the reality of the situation - i am talking about the law . 
  crimea is also controlled by russia , we all understand that , but it belongs to ukraine . 
  and that 's why kids should not be talking about law ... 
  lack of data before perhaps ? 
  i did n't bother reading the whole thing after finding a chapter called `` a father living apart '' . 
  we are not arguing about the necessity for a child to have two parents around and the positive effect on living together with both of the parents . 
  we are talking about the unnecessary marital status . 
  it 's the archaic view . 
  it 's not something that has to exist . 
  just like religion . 
  yet what you described is indirect correlation . 
  remember - i did n't say that there is no correlation , there definitely is !, 
  just that a democratic country is not automatically less corrupt , it depends on many different factoids . 
  well right to self-determination is peremptory norm of international law . 
  banning it on the national level is sort of irrelevant when you are , you know , a subject to international law . 
  well the guy , who was caught [ stealing tampons for his lady ] ( http://g1.nh.ee/images/pix/file15839313_kokk_enja.jpg ) during the bronze night riots in 2007 looked pretty ridiculous . 
  only if you are a religious freak . 
  it 's not a direct correlation . 
  corruption can exist in a non-political way as well and top officials can steal money while the state remains strongly democratic . 
  on the other hand , a dictatorship can be relatively free of stealing from the state if the state has a strict rule and the top leaders do n't particularly steal themselves . 
  i am not saying this is often the case , but it can be so as the correlation between democracy and corruption is indirect .

i have no idea what the future of ukraine will entail and i hope that their economy will improve with eu funds and other western help . 
  maybe not and they will descend into chaos , who knows . 
  war is still unnecessary and will only bring more harm on the region . 
  putin gib back petseri and ivangorod territories pliz . 
  yes , we are pro ukraine . 
  since ukraine wanted to become a western oriented state but russia is not letting this happen and instead is waging war . 
  if you have any evidence at all that ukraine is authoritarian then , i am glad to hear it . 
  idiots , you ca n't limit free speech , it wont be free speech anymore if you could n't talk about religion in a certain way . 
  wow this economist knows what he is talking about , i though the uk leaving would benefit the eu economically . 
  good thing he enlightened this subreddit . 
  fuuuuk we got beat by one potato . 
  well , probably , yeah . 
  i do n't think the migrant community will appreciate it when a bunch of skinheads beat up one of their own . 
  / sss the point is , it does n't help . 
  in fact , it cause even more tensions when these groups roam around . 
  are you dumb mate ? 
  of course by forming even more agressive groups of locals . 
  yep , always thought the latvian name for estonia is funny as hell for some reason . 
  you are right from that perspective but what i 'm saying is , maybe in a few centuries when more people start to consider themselves europeans instead of whatever nationality they are right now a fedralized europe would be a great deal . 
  obviously it would be great for estonians but a single european entity would be far more powerful than one of the big three alone . 
  it would serve to further the interests of europe as a whole instead of a single nation state . 
  though the problem is that euopean nations do n't share the same goals at this very moment . 
  however i 'm no expert on this topic and this will definitely not happen in my lifetime and if it does must be fueled by some kind of cataclysmic event . 
  without the federalization of europe our future is at stake . 
  a future without an united europe is a future dominated by stronger powers such as the usa , india , china , brazil etc. 
  a future with an united europe will be a future with the whole continent dominated by a well developed singular state with a strong military and the power to crush petty states with the economy alone . 
  this is realpolitik , i believe this will happen eventually and to be honest i see no downsides . 
  and to people who do n't want to lose their national identity , i tell you one thing . 
  you are european first x second . 
  nationalism has been the cancer of europe for a long time and i hope it just dies . 
  though i would love to hear others ' opinion on this topic , maybe i am wrong . 
  sadly the state is doing a shit job at delivering , so someone else might also start having a share in that `` industry '' . 
  lets goooo bois rape of paris, 
  estonian papers and news sites are really good imo . 
  paris gunmen wilin ' out in 2016 boi, 
  as an estonian i have to disagree . 
  back in the old russian empire days the methods the empire used to recruit estonian men was insane . 
  you had some officer come to your village and say we need this many men . 
  because nobody wanted to go ( service was fucking 20 years ) the men drew sticks and the guy ( s ) who got the shortest stick had to go . 
  absolutely fucked imo , your whole life depending on what stick you draw . 
  sometimes i dream of a world without conflict where states can just develop peacefully . 
  then i see erdogan and putin and come back to reality . 
  nationalism is the cancer of this world . 
  i do n't have heating right now and it feels like my room is as cold as the outside . 
  conscripts are n't that bad at all , sure professionals and sf are better but people tend to think that they are on the level of farmers in the middle ages . 
  yea this is bs . 
  at least in estonia all men get fucked but to be fair conscription has become a right of passage for men in estonia . 
  many want to go , as do i. 
  so conscription is n't that bad at all . 
  us and australia make such funny caricatures , because every single one is ironic to the core . 
  like the us one where reporters rush to the scene of the split . 
  while the caricature itself is essentially doing the exact same thing . 
  i did n't even know they split before 5 minutes ago hahaha . 
  whooosh, 
  i also am an expert in memeology , many interesting discussions are to be had 4head, 
  the former communist/soviet states will never catch up , i mean the western states are n't just stagnating and waiting for east to recover , they are growing too . 
  kind of hard to believe the same thing happened in lithuania considering you guys are pretty ethnic over there . 
  the russian population is what , less that 4 percent !, 
  there already is a law like that , most people seems to just not give a fuck . 
  unfair dude you live underwater , how do you expect estonians to compete . 
  i challenge you to a game of being obnoxiously loud when drunk . 
  i will propose a few as well . 
  dodging people who ask for smokes and money wife carrying kiiking heavy drinking metal theft and of course the classic casual racism, 
  feelsbadman, 
  estonia has forced conscription and i like it . 
  i see it more as a right of passage for a boy to become a man and of course i think it is a very valuable asset to bolster our defenses . 
  well to be fair all of the possible topics contained the same level of bullshit . 
  i mean russian economy , regular life of russian , domestic society . 
  i can see why people would choose foreign policy , more like a pick your poison type of situation . 
  but come on guys , you 're saying you do n't appreciate the racist shitposts that appear in delfi anonymous section ? 
  tallinn replaced our old trams recently and today was a rainy day , the tram ceiling freaking leaked , so better keeps these prague . 
  they 're old but they can go through hell and come out looking better . 
  let me teach you , in order to squat like a slav you need to be flat footed , this is the easiest step . 
  now obviously having problems with balance you need to put your hands like our president , elbows on knees and they need to be straight out , thus having balance . 
  i used to work in retail and squatting on the toes is a huge pain , the slav squat is simply efficient . 
  am slav confirmed . 
  some cases exist where an estonian has a lot of ancestry from the former cccp due to the immigration/migration that happened in this era all over the cccr . 
  triggered, 
  most estonians who speak english fluently can do the russian accent easily . 
  he might be russian though , who knows . 
  would be hilarious if these coins were made by any other nation but if russia makes them , it \u00b4 s normal . 
  hahaha, 
  estonia should be on this list dude , tallinn is safe , if you stay away from lasnam\u00e4gi , mustam\u00e4gi , \u00d5ism\u00e4gi and p\u00f5hja-tallinn . 
  this list just doesn \u00b4 t work , first if you use this method you get stupid shit like countries having more tourists than population but still inhabiting the list . 
  the other side of things having france below estonia would be stupid as hell as well , if things are done per capita basis . 
  can confirm this . 
  biggest failure by the french system in the history of europe . 
  a radical asks for a second chance and he is given one , what a joke . 
  why though ? 
  you rather some gunman shoot up some school somewhere and kill 10 \u00b4 s rather than be shot down by heavily armed and well trained soldiers ? 
  if this is n't bait you are retarded . 
  hahahahahahaha , eastern turkey higher living standard than estonia . 
  well we saw this in post ww 1 europe . 
  when more than half of the states in europe had authoritarian/totalitarian governments . 
  i do n't think so . 
  these people are digging a grave for their own peoples , i see the rise of another authoritarian europe if this continues . 
  your views are nonsensical . 
  uk less liberal ( aka european ) than ee ? 
  i believe people who fought in ww i would n't give a fuck if they were n't included . 
  czech republic or latvia , so i can make fun of estonians .

  what could possibly lead you to believe that that one specific tag describes nationality and the next one an ethnicity ? 
  especially as the bloody joke does n't even work if interpreted that way ? 
  the joke does n't read `` british and jewish '' , it reads `` english and jewish '' , or `` welsh and jewish '' , or `` welsh and scottish '' for all the difference it makes , as no-one 's questioning the britishness of everyone included . 
  while every single one of those on the image is of czech nationality , they are not of czech ethnicity . 
  bugger . 
  1973 : [ allende dead , pinochet takes power ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/chilean_coup_of_1973 ), 
  it 's the `` russia for russians '' crowd . 
  which does n't seem that bad at first , just your common variety of state nationalism , until you remember the whole `` prison of nations '' thing . 
  14th century afaik . 
  and france is where francia used to be . 
  do germans bitch about it ? 
  swedish banks bankrolled our pre-crash boom handing out shitloads of money , often on terms that would 've been unimaginable back home . 
  it 's no wonder that they used to reap disproportionately high profits from their baltic subsidiaries . 
  as for london -- the `` financial instruments '' that caused the disaster ( not eurozone one , the global one ) and led to the global crisis were largely invented in the city . 
  no , the allenby crossing is the only route that does n't go _ through israel _ . 
  nothing ( neither people nor goods ) moves across it either way w/o israeli permission . 
  i meant that pa has no routes to outside world that are not controlled by israel . 
  trade treaties are n't worth much when your formerly fresh produce is sitting in terminals while papers are being checked . 
   when i know first hand christians and non-religious ( a legal term to describe atheists in the israeli legal system ) that live at settlements , jewish/israeli are often used interchangeably . 
   israel does not have `` recognized borders at all . 
   out of context as the pa has their own legal trade treaties . 
  they ( technically ) do n't have roads , though . 
  the ` catching up ' _ is _ becoming easier thanks to large parts of the west apparently willing to meet us halfway , 
  i foresee poland quietly replacing uk in the ` big three ' in not too distant a future , whether uk stays in or drops off . 
  not tony fucking blair , however , the complete and utter berk , pardon my french . 
  and before that , in the dark times , czechs and poles were seen as the free and wealthy cousins by us poor buggers in ussr proper , 
   however will the clash of cultures prove too much ? 
  i 'd say turkey is a much better fit with eu than russia would be . 
  on the one hand we have a secular parliamentary republic nearing it 's first centennial , on the other we have a byzantine behemoth that has n't clocked a decade 's worth of democracy in all of it 's existence . 
  religion is n't the only factor in ` culture ' , 
   what we should be asking is : why has the eu stuck its nose in spain and portugal but did n't when germany was in a worse situation than those countries ? 
  why are those countries labelled with all sorts of lame puns and demeaning catchphrases yet germany was n't 7 years ago ? 
  why do those countries have to follow germany 's recovery model yet germany was n't pressured to follow any model put forward by other countries back in 2005 ? 
  because germany reformed on it 's own volition ? 
   b ) check out what happened in austria in 1999 . 
  eu 's handling of austria back then was bloody disgraceful . 
  i think the bot handing out flags died a while ago , admins are prepping a new option . 
  no evidence ( yet ) that these accounts are full of stolen money ? 
  it 's literally a [ list of names ] ( http://www.zougla.gr/politiki/article/lista ) , nothing more . 
  suspending judgment on whether to believe still means you do n't believe . 
  there 's this guy , bob . 
  i _ can _ say i will be able to tell whether i 'm his friend or not once i 've met him . 
  but am i his friend or am i not his friend before meeting him ? 
  the question `` do you believe in a deity '' only has yes/no for answers , as does `` do you know for certain whether there is a deity '' . 
  the existence or non-existence of a deity ( or whether bob is a nice guy ) has no bearing on either of those answers , which deal with belief and certainty , respectively . 
  edit : bob . 
   atheism , which is the belief that there is no god _ no belief _ in god , not belief in _ no god _ . 
  you close your eyes and pick an answer at random . 
   so you ended our discussion earlier by basically saying you 'd had enough of me or what i was saying was n't making sense . 
  was n't me . 
   this is where i differ from an atheist . 
  do you understand now ? 
  no offense , but you 're one of us , whether you like it or not  if you 're not a _ theist _ ( someone who believes ) , you 're an _ a-theist _ ( someone who does n't believe ) . 
  atheism and agnosticism are answers to different questions , not mutually exclusive . 
  edit : this is getting frightfully off-topic , shall we continue in pm ? 
   atheism is the belief there are no deities . 
  wrong . 
  atheism is _ no belief _ in deities , not belief in _ no deities _ . 
  to not derail the thread , here 's a link to the [ relevant part of / r/atheism faq ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/faq#whataboutagnosticism ) . 
  no belief was an option , no ? 
  we use our ids as driver 's licences as well , 
  best jettison all us definitions . 
  they 're uniform enough when it comes to europe . 
  all that , and not a word about radio 4 comedy ? 
  actually , no . 
  what i 'm referring to is that there are more options near the center , so people can afford to `` let go '' of their choice after the elections and shop around for a new one . 
  if you 're on the edges , the selection on the offer is relatively limited , so you tend to hold on to it . 
  people on the extreme ends of the political horseshoe are less likely to adjust their preferences -  polling between elections tends to overrepresent both far left and far right . 
  i 'm old enough to be able to drop into russian [ \u043c\u0430\u0442 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mat_%28russian_profanity%29_ ) when i feel the need to ... express myself . 
  wait , what ? 
  exactly . 
  nobody has the right to not feel offended .

  we 've managed to teach christianity how to behave , we 'll manage to do the same with islam , 
  same with russian . 
  the words are there , but the meaning is n't . 
  perceived impartiality due to relative financial independence , i.e. 
  oil . 
  i was driving along a relatively quiet road one day last summer when i suddenly went : `` whoa , that 's the place i stood at ! '' . 
  i did n't remember anything _ about _ where i 'd been at ... but even after more than 2 decades later i instantly recognized the _ place _ , the stretch of road , the line of fields and forest , the village in the distance . 
  powerful memories . 
   but then , what happened to all the regional dialects in france ? 
  not only dialects , but even minority languagues have been pretty much eradicated over past few centuries in the quest for cultural homogeneity . 
  afaik , not too long ago _ le fran\u00e7ais _ as we know it today was spoken by a minority in france itself . 
  finland is officially finnish/swedish bilingual , afaik . 
  let 's just return to latin . 
  ** nepotism ** ( n. ) `` favoritism shown to relatives , especially in appointment to high office , '' 1660s , from fr . 
  _ n\u00e9potisme _ , from it . 
  _ nepotismo _ , from _ nepote _ `` nephew , '' from l. _ nepotem _ ( nom . 
  originally , privileges granted to a pope 's `` nephew '' which was a euphemism for his natural son . 
  [ source ] ( http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=nepotism ) . 
  nepotism is present in the north as well . 
  there 's a difference , though -- in the north , the family & friends get stuck in possibly high-paying but ultimately inconsequential positions where they can do no harm . 
  there 's very little `` he 's my cousin , of course he ca do it ! '', 
  mentality . 
  helge schneider manages both , 
  over here only the presence of a certified public servant is required , the location is up to the couple . 
  also , authorized clergy can do marriages , but they legally represent the state in this case , not ... higher powers , no matter what kind of a show they put up . 
  `` a sharp slowdown in the construction sector '' ... as in , the olympic village was completed on time ? 
  now that 's just silly .

  i understand why it 's a problem , but every country has it 's hyper-active dumb students . 
  i 'm sure ukrainians have nothing against you poles . 
  it would be sad to see polish and ukrainian people get mad at each-other . 
  maybe after the current conflict , ukraine will have new heroes . 
  i agree that caffeine is bad and energy drinks usually have too much of it . 
  no arguments there . 
  the eu membership fee each country has to pay is also calculated based on gdp . 
  do the average russians even go to work in the mornings or have they all accepted it 's pointless , because imperialist americans and eurofascists are about to attack any second ? 
   the sharing and organisation of resources to produce a concerted effort to a common goal needs the same structure no matter if it is infrastructure construction , space exploration , foreign policy or military action . 
  no , it does n't . 
   they all need integration , my choice word since we are already a federation , we have the political makeup of one . 
  you can cooperate without forming a single nation . 
   to picture that a classic military alliance will do us any more good than it has failed to do us in the past 70 years is faulty . 
  nato did help collapse the soviet union , instead of allowing it to advance . 
  also , before that , nazi germany was an empire with a very strict and centralized chain of command , but it was defeated by an alliance . 
   a bunch of shacks do not make a mansion . 
  irrelevant metaphors do not prove anything . 
  are you talking about military alliances again ? 
  both of your points seem to be about military alliances , rather than federalization . 
  artists who have no talent , often just go for cheap tricks , trying to shock people and pretend that 's what art is about . 
   i said they beat persia only when united , the fact that you read `` as a country '' instead `` by alliance '' is on you . 
  then wtf were you even talking about ? 
  my comment was a reply to a previous poster arguing for federalization , not a military alliance . 
  also , the athenian hegemony is a good example of how things go wrong , when power gets too centralized . 
  taurine has a ton of beneficial effects and is completely safe up to 3000 milligrams a day . 
  also , taurine is found naturally in meat , fish and breast milk . 
   the greek city states only beat persia when united you sure ? 
  iirc , the greek city-states only had a military alliance , not a single country . 
  the city-states of ancient greece beat the persian empire several times , eventhough the persian empire was the biggest empire in the world back then . 
  if you think that adding all the countries of europe together into a federalized superstate will magically make another 1 billion europeans appear , then you 're wrong . 
  btw , we 're already less than 1/10 of the world , i believe . 
  next step : people will move out of the cities into smaller towns , which are less ethnically diverse . 
  then they grow more different from each other and want to be more autonomous . 
  eventually , when every ethnic group has their own region , the old nation loses grip and new ones arise . 
  the fall of rome all over again . 
  :p edit : this is a long way from happening , but could eventually happen , if things get worse . 
  most were , yes . 
  hopefully , as we keep recovering from the soviet fuck-ups , the pension also becomes more liveable . 
  if you 're trying to live on pension alone , then you 're doing it wrong imo . 
  like wtf were you doing the previous 40 years if you have no family or investments or savings to support you !, 
  they constantly talk about raising pensions . 
  so they 're kind of like trying to bribe the older generation . 
  they do n't , but if they want to , then `` islamophobia '' should not be the thing stopping them . 
   if you do n't think you have such an obligation then i frankly do n't see the state and military having any obligation to protect you . 
  if it only were like that , but unfortunately the state also requires you to get permits and stuff to obtain the weapons needed to protect yourself . 
  damned if you do , damned if you do n't . 
  do n't worry about it . 
  meh , personally i 'm cool with that . 
  ( sorry for the cliche , but ) no shit , sherlock !, 
  ah , ok , so you guys are not crazy . 
  those few could also be the most violent ones , you know . 
  forcing others to contribute is . 
  if you want your countrymen to help you protect your country , then you have to convince them your country is worth protecting . 
   taxes are n't forced have you tried not paying them ? 
  then fuck equality . 
  making 100 % of the population suffer , because 50 % are suffering , is just increasing suffering . 
  seriously , if the norwegians have 19 months of mandatory service , then i would n't want that for anyone . 
  mandatory military service should be about giving citizens training for when the country gets invaded , not using them as cheap soldiers . 
  imo , 6-8 months is enough to train someone for both war in winter and in summer . 
  they are probably afraid of the muslim students . 
   any integration is going to help eurosceptics i disagree . 
  it depends on how the eu handles it and what kind of integration they try . 
  a common immigration policy is the sort of integration that would drive eurosceptics . 
  and those who do n't like the compromise will turn into eurosceptics . 
  have you not noticed that immigration is one of the primary issues of eurosceptic parties ? 
  between those who are pro- and those who are anti-immigration . 
  quite the opposite imo . 
  it would create a very clear divide . 
  yes , but with poverty , russia 's military would also start to fall behind . 
  not to mention that russia also has foreign assets , which could be counter-confiscated . 
  a light beige or some other mild color could look nice if it fits the bathroom . 
  burn the churches !, 
  rebuild the longboats !, 
  beer and ak-47s for everyone !!, 
  we sail , my brothers !, 
  did they have any data to back that up or did they just invent shit to sell books or whatever ? 
  i agree , if we want to describe russia as one ethnicity , then it 's slavic . 
  otherwise , russia is a huge country , which has conquered many peoples , so it 's probably very mixed . 
  saying russians are finns is like saying russians are chechens . 
  from op 's link :  an interesting fact that in the middle ages , the boundary between the on and muscovy - was precisely the ethnic boundary between the slavs and finns it makes sense that northern-russia has a lot of finno-ugrics , but moscow itself has never been finno-ugric territory afaik . 
  i think you guys are confusing the terms `` finn '' as someone from finland and `` finn '' as a finno-ugric person . 
  wtf ? 
  finnic peoples moved to the baltic coast long before the mongols took over russia . 
  edit : also , mongols were asian . 
  finno-ugrics are blue eyed and often blonde whites . 
  udmurts are also the most red-haired people in the world . 
  why is assad bad again ? 
  turks are already walking on the streets of europe . 
  ever been to germany ? 
  or denmark ? 
  that said , i also do n't think the eu wants turkey . 
  it 's not bullying . 
  without the treaties , the eu has no obligation to provide switzerland access to the eu 's internal market . 
   when rich people from developed countries move to shithole countries en mass they demand a better quality of life from the country , and it follows . 
  actually , it could drive the prices up for locals , because the foreigners have more money to spend than them . 
  because if other people also thought like that , then your cousin or your neighbour or your friend could lose their job . 
  also , it 's beneficial to keep the money in your economy . 
  a foreigner might take that money back home and pay taxes to his government . 
  but someone with the same passport as you , is more likely to spend that money in your country buying services from you or someone you care about , while also paying taxes to your government . 
  your money is of course your property and you can spend it however you like , but imo it is wiser to support your own countrymen .

  i was paraphrasing you . 
  and as a left-wing extremist , you really should n't make jokes like that , rather be ashamed of what your ideological brothers have done to millions of people . 
  wait , did you just call me a fascist ? 
  fascists are just as unintelligent as you extreme left folk - you are both unnormal extremists in the eyes of the normal people . 
  and to even suggest that the idea of anarchism might work really shows how empty a person is in the head . 
  but seriously - your claims about being libertarian left and having anarcho-communist tendencies do n't add up . 
  these two simply do n't go together . 
  and i did n't equate anarchism and communism , you did . 
  you wanted to send me to a gulag camp , yet you claim that that would never happen in your fairy tale fantasy world . 
  yes , i think you are not normal - that 's basically what you are , right ? 
  extremists . 
  extremism is n't normal . 
  that 's like the definition of being an extremist . 
  i know there are differences between your ideologies , of course there are , i just think that all you extreme leftists are extremely uneducated people . 
  the difference between us is that i do n't want to send you to a death camp . 
  yes , everyone , who disagrees with you extreme leftists needs to be sent to a gulag camp . 
  i can not believe people like you exist in the 21st century . 
  no i know about that , but `` more than the next guy '' ? 
  you extreme leftist lot are all the same for us normal people . 
  if you have anarcho-communist tendencies , then why would you hate stalin more as the next guy ? 
  why estonia is an observer in the council and as far as i know has never applied to be a full member . 
  being part of the council is just one thing - nordic countries is also a socio-cultural concept , of which estonia is part of , if you at least knew some basic things about the country . 
  yet this consensus is based on false assumptions as most people advocating for the consensus view know jack shit about estonia . 
  people do that with me as well even though i am 25 . 
  if they do n't have better arguments then it 's their problem . 
  that 's not to say that early teens do n't often make simplistic assumptions , but it 's not to the degree that one should automatically discredit their every argument . 
  not your year of birth ... 
  your year of birth is of course very damaging personal information ... and it 's weird as it could indeed be that - i was quite old when my first grandparent died and all of them have their stories to tell . 
  rather weird  what year were you born ? 
  it may be different if your direct ancestors were deported , imprisoned or murdered . 
  i had my great-grandfather deported in 1944 , died in a labour camp in 1952 , had another great-grandfather imprisoned in 1945 , freed in 1953 and had my 8-year old grandfather , his sister , his mother and his grandmother deported to siberia in 1949 and freed in 1953-1954 . 
  i was born in 1990 and most of my peers feel very negative towards stalin in general . 
  now you really underestimate how people feel about stalin ... 
  why thank you . 
  you sound lonely . 
  seen worse . 
  there is no source for this , just my personal experience . 
  i am definitely not saying it has to be a majority , but as i 've talked about this issue with my peers , relatives and even random people , i have encountered quite many people , who think the same way . 
  if you were indeed referring to stalin , then do n't . 
  i guess more than 50 % of that city has some ancestor , who was either murdered , imprisoned or deported to siberia by this monster . 
  i agree that this is the general understanding of what nordic countries are . 
  by the way , about that specific article . 
  there were long sections about estonia , shetland , orkney and some other territories , that should perhaps be counted as part of the nordic countries . 
  they were removed to a different article , but for some reason that article was closed and now there is nothing left . 
  rather illogical that the article does n't give any information on possible further scope of the nordic countries . 
  however much of the reason people do n't include estonia as part of the nordic countries is the soviet legacy , which unintelligent people think defines europe even today , while in reality estonia has loads in common with the nordic countries and much less with the baltic countries . 
  nope , i do n't even remember which way the european regions were taught at school . 
  but i do know general concepts used by international organizations for example . 
  ok now i understand . 
  your concepts of geography are just way off , i did n't much understand that before . 
  northern europe is almost never just scandinavia . 
  that 's why there 's a special word for scandinavia in the first place . 
  and scandinavia does n't include finland , you know . 
  and no , estonia is not in eastern europe , but northern europe . 
  you can talk of the baltic states in the context of eastern europe only if you are directly talking about an issue that is related to either the direct aftermath of world war i or the soviet occupation period of 1940/1944 -1991 . 
  otherwise , the countries lie in northern europe . 
  and estonia is indeed a nordic state . 
  and i said that we were not talking about the literal meaning , but the general meaning . 
  you claimed that i made a strawman argument because i said nordic does not mean northern [ in the general meaning of the concepts ] . 
  that czech guy answered to the comment `` always wanted to go in northern europe '' with `` eesti can not into nordic '' . 
  as i pointed out that these concepts are not the same , you barged in and countered that yes they are , at least in the literal meaning . 
  as i explained that we were n't talking about the literal meanings , but the general meanings , you continued to argue with me . 
  as i once again said that nordic does not mean northern , you went as far as to accuse me of a strawman argument . 
  no , if i feel that i am wrong , then i have no reason or need to state the otherwise . 
  but just read the beginning of the conversation again and you 'll understand why you caused the confusion . 
  there is literally no way i could have understood what you were meaning by looking at your first comments . 
  i care little of who was right or wrong , just do n't bend the facts . 
  please read that conversation over and you 'll see exactly that you did n't note that you changed the subject and hence i misunderstood what you were talking about . 
  you are part of that argument as much as i am so do n't blame me for this ... 
  thank you for these suggestions but i was not bothered by what was apparently said to you by some apparently estonian fellas - i was bothered by the fact that you thought it was just estonians hating on russians while the facts just do n't support your claim . 
  i mean , do n't get me wrong - we do our fair share of russia-bashing here , but not so randomly ... 
  as i was talking about the meaning of northern europe and you answered about the meaning of nordic countries without mentioning the change , it was 100 % your mistake . 
  yet my experience as an estonian on this issue has slightly more value then your ... like ... opinion , man . 
  nope , personal experience as i am an actual estonian . 
  as we were talking about the meaning of what is northern europe , the confusion here is entirely your mistake . 
  however by the literal meaning we are a nordic country as our culture is nordic , we speak a similar language to finnish and we are definitely not baltic . 
  it 's the common meaning that you mean . 
  why ? 
  are you trying to be funny ? 
  no i meant these two false factoids told by the locals do n't really sound like the average estonian hating on russians . 
  i mean , we do have a rough sentiment about them , but why make up statistics for that ? 
  estonians usually know that ethnic russians have a lower birth rate and i have n't even heard about russians coming to estonia to give birth . 
  do n't wonder why i reached that conclusion : `` always wanted to go in northern europe '' -  `` eesti can not into nordic '' -  me : `` nordic does not mean northern '' -  you : `` that 's exactly what it means '' . 
  but what were you referring to with your sentence then ? 
  so friggin naive ... 
  that graph really should have zero on the scale to calm down folks like you . . 
  well definitely not * hell * ( estonian for `` tender '' ) for us . 
  russians themselves ? 
  please do n't be that guy ... 
  the us is both a democracy and a republic . 
  i do n't understand why you americans get your political concepts so wrong all the time ... 
  yes , ethnic russian citizens of estonia . 
  i guess when things are peaceful enough , people will find new reasons to not consider it peaceful , sort of first world problems . . 
  if there 's one thing that russia knows how to do , it 's propaganda . 
  and it works with so many people . . 
  we 've had mass immigration . 
  even our social democrats are rather conservative about immigration due to that . 
  economic stagnation is also not an alien concept here . 
  so is their idea that it 's the car industry or nothing ? 
  german help = / = having fascism,

  i do n't know what your problem is . 
  it probably just depends on the other language . 
  in english `` the netherlands '' is fairly simple to use . 
  another problem is that the word `` nether '' means `` low '' and is directly translated and * madalmaa * could very well mean any `` low land '' ( * madal maa * ) . 
  yes . 
  although i see this more among latvians than lithuanians . 
   back in the 1990s when they came up with this plan to brand themselves as nordic yes , we have a great conspiracy going on . 
   so now every self respecting estonian nationalist thinks that being baltic is somehow bad how come you are still on this ? 
  since when does different = better/worse ? 
  seriously , what is wrong with you guys and such ridiculous accusations ? 
   speaking frankly : you do very much have `` second class citizens '' though ... we only have citizens and people , who are not citizens . 
  it is really as simple as that . 
   it 's obviously not super-racist , but there really never was any other reason for not offering citizenship to all long term inhabitants other then `` russophobia '' . 
  yeah , `` no other reason '' being that they are illegal immigrants . 
  please educate yourself more on the subject before you open your mouth . 
  if i 'm not mistaken , then it did recognize the illegal and secret chapters of the molotov-ribbentrop pact in the late soviet times . 
  this of course did not change anything as estonia remained under a foreign occupation ( although * de facto * self-governing by that time ) . 
   i know several people who think that citizens of the baltic countries are just ungrateful bastards . 
  this lie is huge . 
  i 've seen tv shows where they talk about this and how russia should issue a formal demand for reparations as they `` invested so much '' into the baltic states . 
  strong supporters of abolishing the flat income tax and replacing it with a progressive tax , support of creating utterly unnecessary municipal jobs ( like the infamous `` bus guards '' ) to fight with joblessness , promising radical pension and social welfare rises which every sane person knows they wo n't be able to fulfill etc , etc , etc. 
  the more they are being lied to , the more they believe those lies . 
  but could the word `` fanatic '' be used if such a huge share of the population shares these views ? 
  sounds more like a systematic problem than a case of fanaticism . 
  i have to agree that the netherlands has a fucked up scenario . 
  * but * it 's sort of their own fault for having their name in plural , which is extremely shitty to use in many languages . 
  but there is also the balkan peninsula . 
  this is a geographic term first . 
  balkan people are all the ethnic groups living on the balkan peninsula . 
  there is no macro ethnic group called the balkan people . 
  the term baltic is of the baltic sea , yet the term balts only refers to two and the baltic states to three countries , while several others border the baltic sea . 
  so in that sense , i do n't really see an analogy here . 
  because it is used as a primary term for all three , even when talking about them separately . 
  look , i get the need to sometimes group these countries together . 
  and that sometimes is a wide case as we have common geopolitical history from 1939 and on , including common stance on russia . 
  this is not little , but this is not enough to be used as the main grouping for the three countries as there are vast ethno-linguistic , religious and historical divisions between the three countries and such a grouping only creates unnecessary generalizations . 
   i am for increased cooperation between our three states who is n't ? 
   i do n't want us to be divided into a million different groups . 
  in what sense ? 
  there are three nations within this grouping - two baltic and one finnic . 
  there 's also the grouping of estonia + latvia v. lithuania in the historical and religious context . 
  you ca n't generalize and pretend like these divisions do n't exist . 
   we stand together as our fathers and mothers did in the 90ies , rather then piss all over each other screaming about who is not baltic , who is finnic and how that makes us completely different peoples for god knows what fucking reason . 
  what would be the reason for being different ? 
  we * are * different , regardless what we want . 
  i still fail to see the logic where being different = wanting bad relations etc. 
   no one is forcing you to become a balt to be in the baltic states , that 's how we 're called !, 
  i think we can compare it with three neighbors living in one house . 
  two of them are brothers and share the same surname , but because three live in the same house , face the same problems and get along really well , the world treats them as the same bunch ( for obvious reasons of course , knowing very little about their differences ) and often calls them by the same name . 
  now if the third guy sometimes points out that he does n't carry that surname as he 's from a different family , does that mean that he does n't want to be friends with the two brothers or that he thinks better of himself ? 
  because if so , then that 's the logic i just do n't get . 
   if you argue against the term - baltic states - by itself , then , yes , i do believe you think you 're deluded or want to be better than us . 
  and this is the shit i just do n't get . 
  for very obvious reasons . 
  the term either comes from baltic people i.e. 
  balts or the baltic sea . 
  both are rather misleading as there are only two major baltic peoples ( latvians and lithuanians ) , while all countries adjacent to the baltic sea could be named baltic in that sense , but you do n't really see that happening . 
  eastern baltic ( after the sea ) may be closer to the truth , but it would still include finland and perhaps bits of russia , but on the other hand eastern baltic is also [ an ethno-linguistic term ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/baltic_languages ) that again excludes estonians . 
  i like bringing out mistakes . 
  i 'm not automatically angry over them , but i think it 's a necessary human behavior as that 's at least one step closer to this mistake not being repeated again . 
  which would all be fine , but every time a mistake like this is brought out , there will be some latvians and lithuanians , who come with arguments like `` he wants to be better than us '' or `` he has delusions '' whatever . 
   does he/she see being baltic as something bad , what a classic . 
  i do n't know where this stems from . 
  considering the amount of close friends i have in latvia , such a conclusion is just preposterous . 
  my only problem is that this term creates a generalization . 
  many people will think that there 's this huge similarity between the three countries . 
  while estonia might share a lot with latvia , as does lithuania with latvia , but estonia and lithuania share rather little . 
  and a collective history under a foreign occupation is sort of unjustified for a regional grouping . 
  imagine calling half of europe one region because they were under nazi occupation . 
  what 's the purpose of that ? 
   i guess he likes to force the pov that they are more like finns than baltic . 
  wtf , seriously . 
  are you really lacking in education or something ? 
  we are not finns . 
  we are finnic people , i.e. 
  baltic finns , just like finns themselves . 
  it 's not such a difficult concept , i do n't understand why you have problems comprehending it . 
   estonia will be a baltic state for the general population for years to come . 
  because the general population especially outside these countries knows jack shit about these countries . 
   but we do consider them to be baltic ( but not balts , yes i know its difficult ) ) which is sort of horribly confusing for people outside this region , do n't you think ? 
   `` baltic states `` is a popular and useful classification . 
  yes . 
  but `` balts '' is not for estonians , it 's just incorrect . 
  they 've got this idea that every time someone from estonia brings out our differences with the baltic states , we must be looking down on them for some reason . 
  as if different = better . 
  except `` balts '' is n't used for estonians in any context , unlike the term `` baltic states '' , which is conventionally used for estonia as well , be it reasonable or not . 
  since `` baltic states '' is not an ethnic grouping , then there really is no other way to name all their people as `` inhabitants of the baltic states '' . 
  the terminology is murky already with the inclusion of estonia into the umbrella term `` baltic states '' . 
  calm your tits , nobody 's triggered . 
  it was just an incorrect usage of an ethnic term . 
  what if some people deserve to be called `` russian puppets '' ? 
  nordics is not an ethnic term . 
  the macro ethnic group would be [ finnic people ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/baltic_finns ) ( and the far larger finno-ugric people or uralic people ) . 
  the term `` baltic finns '' is a synonym , but it sort of creates a confusion as it sounds as if it 's somehow related to baltic people , i.e. 
  balts . 
  understandable . 
  i as a local am rather tired of such articles . 
  they offer nothing new , just repeat the same old story which we have known for decades . 
  apparently the washington post does n't know that the word [ balts ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/balts ) is an ethnic term for only latvians and lithuanians , but not estonians . 
  basically : how is it not ?

  ... or they will just lose a hell of a lot of money if they start blocking tourists 's entry to the country because of that , 
   no one in london cares about anything outside the m25 this is the same thing they say in russia about moscow , only there the m25 is the moscow ring road ( mkad ) . 
  there is a saying `` is there life beyond mkad ? '', 
  sounds fair , would definitely have to look more closely into portugal 's laws , thank you !, 
   we have a `` separation of assets '' option that ca n't be contested , like in the us or the uk . 
  can you elaborate a bit more about this , like in an example ? 
  and the reason that they do n't want to go back tpo turkey is ... ? 
  the second one is hilarious , but the whole green sludge or whatever in the front still looks ridiculous . 
   have integration be done by those you have a mandate to protect and educate what did you mean by this ? 
  `` but you 're out of your mind if you think it can punish people for something as vague as being a bad parent . '', 
  it 's not exactly vague , and the `` punishment '' can be in a form of public opinion and stance . 
  it may be enough . 
  i\u00e4m not tlaking about only legal punishment here . 
  `` part of maturing and becoming an adult is handling your own shit '' you are pathetic , blaming the victim here , it\u00e4s not their `` shit '' to begin with , you are contradicting yourself in the same post ( `` it 's not your fault '' ) . 
  you ca n't equate someone who was born in a fatherless home with most other people born not in broken homes , which are a billion times better , if you like big numbers so much . 
  `` challenge . 
  accepted . '', 
  i am this child who spent his whole childhood in a broken fatherless home , somehow people like you become very quiet with your irresponsible philosophies when this get mentioned . 
  you are cool on the internet , but in real life you voice opinions like that only in communities , where you know you wo n't get retribution for saying that . 
  this is how societies break down , when responsibility is not enforced on those who reject it . 
  this is why the african american society in the usa , for example , is so violent with their high % of broken homes . 
  this is the third time i ask this quesiton and get no definite answer in this thread , but here goes : what consequences are there for the mother , that decided to go with the pregnancy , being capable of knowing that there is a strong chance that the father will leave , if she does n't provide a stable and normal upbringing for the child ( not the broken home sort ) ? 
  since there are no real consequences for that , then it 's open to abuse . 
  it 's sort of a social taboo to speak about this , it 's the man that almost always to blame , and in many cases it 's right , but try speaking about the wrong decisions that the mother made and get ready for insults . 
  because there are no or very few consequences for that decision . 
  what happens when the woman decides to do this and raises a child in a broken home ? 
  does the child get compensated in some way for the damage done to him ? 
  not talking only about financial compensation , but in a more broader sense . 
  as far as i 've seen and heard it 's basically a taboo to speak of the responsibiity of the single mothers for their decisions . 
  i 'm not talking about every single one , but about the ones who decided not to abort . 
  i guess it 's unethical , if she knows that beforehand yes . 
  then again if she does bring the child she takes more blame , that if the she were to be abandoned by the father when the child was already born . 
  ultimately it 's about the child , that is born , if he is born , because he is 100 % innocent in this . 
  he does n't deserve the negative consequences of their decisions , and should be compensated for this in any form and way possible to the expense of the bio . 
  mother and father . 
  people know that condoms can break , they know that there is always the possibility of the mother not terminating the pregnancy ( but it depends on whether the woman is a reasonable person or not , so not exactly unpredictable and hence not 100 % unpreventable ) . 
  this is a bit similar to opening a business , expecting profit , and then losing money anyway , you do n't say `` i did n't want this '' and go away unharmed . 
  it 's also easy to make this decision when the man is not obligated to pay for it as well . 
  it 's because most of the burden falls on the fatherless child , not the parents . 
  let me get this straight , if a woman fails , what are the consequences ? 
  i can see the consequences for the child , but as others mentioned here it 's `` acceptable '' and `` such is life '' . 
  from what i can see , for example , from african american single families in the us , where the % of fatherless homes is horrible , a lot of children take the path of becoming criminals and other similar paths . 
  so not the mother , but others pay for this . 
  so what happens with the woman , when she fails ? 
  because if nothing really happens , then , yeah , it 's going to be abused by somebody , especially if it becomes a norm , a commonplace thing . 
  how is she going to be punished if she does n't compensate that to the child ? 
  you ca n't freedom without responsibility , it 's not freedom anymore . 
  i 'm not tlaking about whether this is legal , i 'm tlaking about the actual tconsequences for a child . 
  legal does n't mean moraly sound or fair . 
  `` well , it does , but this is life . '', 
  no it 's not , it 's the decision of certain human beings to do that . 
  they have moral obligations to support their children , if they do n't they should be punished by the society . 
  no one in sound mind would want to be born this way . 
  i dare you to say this '' well this is life '' in the face of a man or woman who had to go through this , it 's pathetic that they are people like you who can justify this blatant irresponsibility of another . 
  `` she should be sole responsible for it . '', 
  and how is she going to be responsbile for it , may i ask ? 
  the vast majority of single mothers if not all ca n't give the same experience and support to the child that a full family can . 
  so how is the mother going to compensate that to the child ? 
  it 's the same thing as being abandoned by your father , but now he is 100 % legally not paying your mother any money . 
  it 's further shifting the burden of responsibility on the child , who gets no say in this , he only gets the negative effects of these `` decisions '' . 
  easy to make a `` legal abortion '' decision when you are not the one who 's going to pay for it . 
  `` the law is set up with child 's interest in mind . '', 
  how does it defend the child 's interest , if the woman decides to have the child anyway ( nothing prevents her legally ) and this `` legal abortion '' option is used by the father . 
  it 's basically legalizing the option of single motherhood , now with no financial help . 
  the child will pay for this ultimately and much more than the father or the mother . 
  i think the mother party dismissed their ideas on necrofilia and incest a week or so ago . 
  `` sure , but i 'm ok writing this off as `` this is life '' . '', 
  so what should be done about this ? 
  and no , the child does n't just lose some `` luxuries and comforts '' he loses a father figure with all the necessary psychological effect it has and gets the negative effects of its absence . 
  not to mention the financial side . 
  there 's a reason why fatherless children are less successful , more prone to violence , crime in life . 
  and that is reason people ignore the responsiblity they should be facing and a part of the society allows it . 
  your opinion totally ignores the needs of the child that is born , if he is born . 
  because the child is the one who is going to take most of the negative sides of these decisions that are described here . 
  are you going to just write this off as `` this is life '' ? 
  you wo n't determine that with this test , they will answer appropriately that ` poland is ok '' , while thinking to themselves `` who 's going to stop me from getting to sweden ? '', 
  `` you only get to stay if you are independent of governmental aid , at which point you are a ( at least financially ) net positive to that country . '', 
  first time i hear this , do i understand this correctly , that only those who do not contribute , who will be unemployed etc will go back ? 
  because that 's definitely not what i said and i 've never heard it being stated this way either , if they want to stay they should go through all the procedures that other countries 's people would have gone through . 
  they will just flee poland for sweden , how can we guarantee that they stay ? 
  refugees should be stripped of the right to receive any social benefits etc at all , they should be given the very basic things to survive and that 's it , and when syria , or iraq get better - they go back to rebuild their country . 
  if anyone wants to stay they have to do the procedures that everyone does . 
  downvoted by people with no sense of humor , 
  pretty black face , you will be roman your only flag will be the italian one !, 
  we will march together with you and parade in front of the duce and the king !, 
  it 's about ethiopia , but it will do , 
  i have already proposed a solution - build a camp for eu money . 
  they stay there until their homeland becomes safe then they leave . 
  now the only problem is that we need politicians with balls to do this . 
  if refugees with no documents refuse to say where they come from , then they stay in the camp indifenetely with no luxuries , just enough food and shelter to survive . 
  anyone who want to live in the eu must follow all the same procedures as everyone else does . 
  good , then implement the finnish solution of helping them go back to home . 
  i see this in a different way where germany is taking a nap and the other countries are actually thinking and already implementing solutions . 
  there 's more than one solution , like closing the border , eliminating incentives for fake refugees to come etc. 
  i would prefer to deport anyone who is n't a refugee back to where they came from , and if they have no documents , then arrange a camp somewhere on the border with turkey , with no legal to travel across the eu . 
  once syria and iraq are safer , at least a part of the refugees will go back to their countries . 
  `` and that solves anything how ? '', 
  closed borders - now way for economic migrants posing as refugees to come - the refugee problem becomes much less severe at the very least . 
  also , the actual refugees go back to syria/iraq once the war is over . 
  by this point i assume that if i call you a troll i will probably be right than if i say that you are naturally naive and ignorant .

  attack us ? 
   they should face the consequences . 
  so your advice is to just give up ? 
  sorry , not going to happen . . also this part : '' when a small country opens up to world it 's always better for it . 
  for instance countries such as uk , germany and france can endure santcions or no trade far better than ee countries . '', 
  this is just incoherent rambling ... 
   an individual in an ee country can have a better life in general compared to an individual with the same opportunuties inside that ee country 20 years ago . 
  which to me is an improvement . 
  one can study in a better university for less cost and can actually work through and afford his/her studies . 
  so what ? 
  what has that got to do with anything . 
  yes , countries do benefit from free trade , both sides benefit from trade . 
  we have worked for our success it has not been given to us . 
  eu structural funds are a very very small part of that . 
  will be like 5 billion in total . 
  that is not a enough to concede sovereignty . 
  free movement also works both ways . 
  new markets for your entrepreneurs , new jobs for our workers . . all that has nothing to do with this crisis ... we do n't owe you jack . 
  if you want the money back . 
  i 'm sure most people would rather do that , because we did not join eu for the financial aid anyway . 
  we 're not that big on '' free '' lunches . . 
  and why is that ? 
   eastern europe will be the end of the eu . 
  if the eu is going to be another ussr , then let 's hope so . 
  you 're welcome !, 
   i guess better get used to it , as it is going to be passed on for generations . 
  if it keeps going on like this , you will have white extremists in power in one generation and anyone brown will get shot on the street . . 
  the us might not want a hot war . 
  a cold war will go just as it did the last time . 
  russia will loose ( only faster ) . 
  you could even argue that it has already started . . 
   she looks exactly like i thought she 'd look . 
  yup , that 's a bona fide shit hippie right there . 
  if that ever happens here , i will find a way to start a war with russia ... nuke us from orbit . . it 's the only way to be sure . . 
   do you even know what you 're talking about , or even what you 're reading ? 
  when did i say russia would pick a fight with the us ? 
  you are saying the us would pick a fight with russia over a country that practically means nothing to them . 
  does the us seem like country that backs out of a fight ? 
  nato is the cornerstone of us power . 
  one of the reasons us can create money like no tomorrow and get away with it . 
  they have the biggest stick , smart money is always on us until that is true . 
  all that is worth throwing away over an economically insignificant petrostate in your opinion ? 
  how does that apply to europe exactly ? 
  this article is absolute bs . . 
  yeah that recipe works when your currency is the reserve currency . 
  that is a huge advantage the us has . 
  others have to build reserves during the good times . 
  and that 's where governments mostly fail . 
  also it wont always work in the long term if the problems are structural . 
  for some reason the fed is not in a hurry to pull away the honeypot and if a new lehman happens , they have shot their wad already . 
   because , of britain and the eastern europeans ( e.g. 
  poland , czech republic and hunangary ) . 
  for the same reason they are against refugee quotas , for the same reason they were against increasing the rigths of the eu and frontex . 
  they see it as ` not their problem ' and if somebody brings it up , it is evil imperialism . 
  all you hear about here is '' wtf why is no one protecting the borders ? '', 
  they will compromise . . both will give up something . . 
  why not ? 
   for those who 'll ratify ... why should n't we hold you responsible some day - retroactively , and let you pay with life and blood . 
  cool , same goes for the refugee crisis i hope ? 
   although all together free trade with the us would be amazing . 
  eu rules are way too restrictive and idiotic . 
  no way is the us that stupid . . 
  why should these things be mandatory ? 
  especially the 40 hour work week . 
  bullshit laws aimed at pleasing slackers . . 
   trump is so often bankrupt he 's clearly a greek-american . 
  he actually has german roots :d, 
   but seriously , in worker laws , the us is closer to developing countries than to developed countries . 
  how so ? 
   are food , housing , clothes etc. 
  human rights ? 
  yes ? 
  why do you even say they are pro-russian ? 
  i can see that about orban , but the others . 
  they just look pro-themselves imo . 
  '' i do n't understand this reasoning . 
  v4 are democratic states , they elected their pro - russian leaders . '', 
  the same way you can vote to be in the eu , because you think free trade in europe is a good thing and later find out you are forced to bring migrants into your country . 
  in politics you always get a spoonful of sugar and a bigger spoonful of shit right after that . 
  i doubt any of the parties we 're elected on a '' let 's join russia 's sphere of influence '' platform . 
   one could even argue allowing europe to be given a reality check would be beneficial to us long-term interests in getting european nations to invest in their military infrastructures and personnel . 
  what would that reality check look like ? 
  russian soldiers taking everything from estonia to poland ? 
  you do realize that once that happens , that part of the world is russia for good . 
  also the population will now serve as russian soldiers . 
  so more enemies for you . 
  next up germany ? 
  if you give an inch , sooner or later the us will have to get involved and then we 're talking nukes not military bases . 
   we already are accused by many that we sponsored a coup in ukraine . 
  sorry , but we have little to gain from getting more involved . 
  this is a european issue and needs to stay that way . 
  by whom ? 
  that 's the key here . 
  why the fck do you care what western europe thinks when you have real allies just east of germany , serious about defense . 
  the eu is not a single country . 
  you want total isolation for the us ? 
  why does it make sense to start a war in some random desert country and at the same time not care about your allies ? 
  schizophrenic behavior . . 
   a `` real leader '' would have already fallen into one of the putin 's traps . 
  merkel and hollande might very well see putin 's body flow by the river .

  but state-sponsored research is also quite helpful to encourage innovation . 
  all i advocate for is equal opportunity , individual and personal responsibility for one 's actions , and tax equality . 
  i 'm sorry if this makes me evil . 
  frankly , i ca n't see why you would say that , though . 
  you do , proportionally . 
  20 % of 10 000 is more than 20 % of 1 000 . 
  it 's far from fair that those who have a better job should be punished with a higher tax ** rate ** . 
   you should really go live in america , it would be perfect for you . 
  i highly doubt it . 
   we will stay here in europe where we actually help the less well off in society . 
  how has that anything to do with discriminating the rich ? 
   did your ability to try make you rich ? 
  i would n't consider myself rich , yet . 
  but as an entrepreneur , i 'm pretty sure that initiative and the willingness and ability to try is what has brought me to where i am now . 
   in what industry do you work ? 
  in the it industry . 
   you have no idea how many products , including high-tech products , require labor to produce . 
  mass production exclusively by robots is limited to only the highest-volume products . 
  if we had more educated people to develop new systems to automate things , as well as government funding to do so , i do n't see how it would be a problem . 
  yes , a rich person definitely can ** afford ** to pay more in taxes . 
  the question is , why ** should ** he ? 
  a rich person has earned that `` extra '' . 
  it 's his choice to save it , spend it or maybe give it to charities . 
  it 's really not the state 's business how that extra is spent . 
  what , because my world view differs from yours , i am `` unnuanced '' and sheltered ? 
  people do n't have equal opportunities . 
  but they have an opportunity . 
  yes , some people have to work more to achieve what others got with less effort . 
  i think it 's time to accept that the world is unfair , and you are n't entitled to everything just because . 
  you have the choice to put in effort , or not . 
  and your life will depend on that choice . 
  at least i can think of other arguments that personal attacks . 
  i find that free education is a great opportunity to not be poor . 
  they ** do ** give back to it . 
  they pay taxes like every other person and because they earn more , the amount of money they pay is also considerably larger . 
  that does not justify raising the tax rate . 
  running a factory without workers ? 
  easy , we have robots and technology for that . 
  which came from people who invested a lot of time in education . 
  garbage collection ? 
  we can develop technology to replace that too . 
  again , thanks to scientists . 
  yes , there are lots of low-earning jobs . 
  almost all of them can be relatively easily replaced . 
  exceptions always exist . 
  fact is that the trend is the same . 
  people are given the opportunity to earn more , they either take it or leave it , and live with the consequences . 
  the flat tax and very reasonable tax rates in estonia also give us `` free '' medical care , education and government services . 
  free , as in paid by taxpayers . 
  no reason at all to discriminate the rich . 
  i 'm not angry at all . 
  as i 've said , higher education is free in most european countries . 
  all you need to do is seize the opportunity and put in some effort . 
  if you decide not to , whose fault is it ? 
  money is not the only thing that can be invested . 
  you can invest your time in education , which is free in most european countries . 
  you may not have the mental capability to be a business manager , but you can at least put in the effort to not be poor . 
  i agree , not everyone can be rich . 
  but everyone can be not poor . 
  ** your ** decisions and ** your ** investments make ** your ** future . 
  if you resort to * ad hominem * attacks instead of defending your arguments , maybe they are n't valid after all ? 
  the trash could very well be collected by robots . 
  one of the only reasons we ca n't replace a very large majority of the `` sucky jobs '' with technology and robots is the fact that many less educated people will lose their jobs . 
  tell me how it works in `` real life '' then . 
  tell me that those who invested 18 years instead of 9 of their life in education have the same rate of poverty . 
  tell me that taking risks and trying hard will not , in any way , influence your income . 
  tell me that nobody is responsible for their own life , and the whole system is unfair . 
  the point of what i 'm saying is not that the jobs with less income require less working hours or effort . 
  i 'm saying they require considerably less skills and investment . 
  yes , those who drop out after middle school are paying taxes for the next 8 years while i get my higher education . 
  but i will be paying , even with flat taxes , a marginally larger amount in total after graduating , possibly for the next 30 - 40 years . 
  proportionally , i really ca n't see how the poorer worker contributed more . 
  the thing with higher-income households is that they have more income to spend . 
  yes , a poorer family may spend 100 % of his net income , let 's say , 600 euros a month . 
  the richer family , however , even when spending 50 % of their net income , could spend 3000 euros a month . 
  even when spending a smaller percentage , the household with a higher income spends considerably more than one that earns less . 
  every low-income household has the opportunity to try and at least not be poor . 
  if you are not willing to put in the effort to improve your own life and help yourself , why should others do it for you ? 
  if equality is what you want , progressive tax is not the way to go . 
  if you want everyone to have a great life , no matter how much the contribute , then yes , socialist policies are the way to go . 
  communism is the ideology that promises equally comfortable life for everyone . 
  go with that . 
  higher income should be encouraged because it contributes more to the economy and society . 
  it nets higher living standards and results in a wealthier country and population . 
  why should higher income be discouraged by higher taxes is the question . 
  nobody ** has ** to do the `` sucky '' jobs . 
  they have or had the option to invest in education and get a better job . 
  this is not about estonia and i 'm not representing my country here . 
  it 's about the fact that people are given the opportunity to succeed , and if you do n't take advantage of it , it 's really not the fault of those who do . 
  sorry , but it usually is . 
  ignoring facts makes you subjective . 
  subjectivity is not really the way to go when making policies . 
  the problem is that i have earned these benefits with my investment of time and money . 
  those who decide not to educate themselves and not take risks should , in all fairness , not get those benefits . 
  my use of the word equality is quite objective . 
  everyone should be given , and usually are given , an equal opportunity . 
  this is achieved by free education . 
  if the person decides to take advantage of this opportunity , he can live well and comfortably , or at least not be poor . 
  if he decides he does n't want to study , work and take risks , he ends up poor . 
  i consider this equal for everyone , since it depends on the decisions of every individual .

   `` i 'm here almost four months without work . 
  when are they going to let me work ? 
  or increase the money they give me ? '', 
  he said . 
  others complained about the food provided . 
  `` what can be done to make it improve is for them to make a list to buy things we need and we can cook by ourselves . 
  that 's all , '' said alexander ( 29 ) , from nigeria . 
  the centre 's management says that there 's nothing wrong with the quality of the food , it 's just different tastes for different cultures . 
  what 's most bizarre to me , is the entitlement some refugees have . 
  `` give me more money , i do n't like your food '' . 
  i could n't picture an estonian going to another country to get refuge and then complain that the food is n't good enough or the free money they 're getting is too little . 
   every country has done shit in the past , and all of it was brown , here and at the north of the wall europe . 
  ok , tell me what shit estonia has done . 
  it will just make them poorer for a while , still richer than many eurozone members who have been contributing to their bailout funds . 
  yes they wo n't reach their previous gdp per capita any time soon , but maybe they did n't belong there at the first place ? 
  wait , are you saying i ca n't unilaterally decide to stop paying my house mortgage ? 
  this is fucking bullshit , where 's muh democracy ? 
   also i 'm struggling to see how even more debt is supposed to reverse the 25 % shrink in greece 's gdp since the troika 's policies started being implemented in the first place ? 
  it is n't , maybe their gdp should n't have been this high in the first place and they inflated it with all the borrowing ? 
  maybe it 's just now starting to reflect reality ? 
  okay shoot , how many federations can you name where smaller entities gave up sovereignty willingly ? 
  their minimum wage , average wage and pensions are still way above . 
  that 's probably the reason the `` austerity '' is n't working . . 
  well that 's a silly statement , but in this case , we 're small players , whatever bailout they would decide on , we would n't have to pay a lot anyway , so there 's a lot of indifference here as well , so we will probably end up swimming with the tide . 
  you wo n't get anyone to join this federation if you tell them that they 're permanently giving up their sovereignty . 
  not related to europe . 
  it 's more abundant than gold or silver . 
  there are already ways to take uranium out of other sources but the current mines are cheaper to mine , if they would run out we would switch to other sources . 
  in practice uranium wo n't run out . 
   lack of fissile supply . 
  we actually have a pretty much infinite amount of fissile supply . 
  eu would most likely go for it with a few concessions , most likely restricting moldovans from seeking employment in other eu countries for a certain period . 
  the problem with renewables is cost and storage . 
  if they 're used for supplementation they 're great , but they 're nowhere near ready to completely take over . 
  also , overall nuclear is still better and clean , so why not use it ? 
  because we 're talking about russia and you start talking about ukraine ? 
  * but whatabout ukraine ? 
  also usa !!, 
  * i was just kidding around , but you going to every thread that 's remotely about ukraine to spread pro-russian propaganda is just silly . 
  that 's like saying the guy who studied and did well on the exam had it easy and the guy who did n't and did n't do well just has it hard . 
  or the person who goes jogging every morning for 3 miles and is healthy has it easy , while the guy who sits on his ass all day and is diabetic has it hard . 
  no , this blaming everyone else but themselves is what keeps countries like greece down in the first place , and you are perpetuating the same faulty logic . 
  you will never get up if you do n't take responsibility for your own actions . 
  i 'm just making fun of you , could you kindly stick to spreading your propaganda in / r/ukrainianconflict ? 
   it was considerably easier for the warsaw pact countries because they had a clear target to eliminate , as well as a ( mostly ) new political class . 
  there was a clear political discontinuity with the previous system . 
  * because some did it , clearly it must have been easy . 
  * no , it was n't easy and many did n't , some still have n't . 
  romania is just now starting to clean house , hungary and bulgaria are still very corrupt . 
  who are you to tell * us * , who went through extreme poverty , chaos and hardships just two decades ago , that we had it easy ? 
  it took extreme sacrifice to get to where we are now . 
  but , `` boohoo , poor greeks sipping mai tai 's on the beach , ca n't get their shit together '' . 
  you do understand that most russian fighters are just vacationing ? 
  not all former warsaw pact countries did and i find it funny how if someone manages to do something , it must have been easy and you must find excuses why they did . 
  this sort of a defeatist attitude is why there are so many countries and people stuck in this loop of misery and stagnation . 
  well , corruption means complacency from the general public . 
  estonia was corrupt to the core during the soviet occupation , it took us only a decade to clean it up .

  i think it 's more to do with the greek people constantly voting for populists , `` well , he 's promising me a pension of 1 billion euros at 35 years of age , seems like a good deal ! '' . 
  i mean you do n't end up defaulting a bazillion times by mistake . 
   from the greek political class if only there were some way the greek people could decide which politicians they want to see in the government .

  so only accepting young immigrants would make economic sense ? 
  how would social programs make up for an entire life of missing or bad education ? 
  and why do you think they would even want to study ? 
  i think it was norway where 60 % of the immigrants on welfare did n't even bother to show up to free norwegian classes . 
  what would you think the percentages were if it was math , history and the like instead ? 
   they dont get the same education or job chances nationals get on average . 
  which is a social problem . 
  hence why i didnt argue about there being reasonable social reasons to question immigration . 
  just that there are no inherent economic reasons to say no to immigration . 
  some problems might show themselves as economic deficits , but they arent actual economic problems . 
  can you expand on how they do n't get the `` same education or job chances '' ? 
  what do you even mean by `` education chances '' ? 
  if non-eea migrants cost billions of dollars of tax money to a country , how is it not an actual economic problem ? 
   being against immigration ( even non-eea ) without any clarifiers on what exactly you want to have changed is being nationalistic . 
  i think they 're really clear about what they want to have changed - the amount of non-eea immigration . 
  it only shows that they arent treated correctly . 
  what do you mean not being treated correctly ? 
  how are they not treated correctly ? 
  i 'm just trying to get to the bottom of this , of why did you single out white , working class males and the elderly . 
  saying they 're disenfranchised or left behind/unsure about their identity seems really bizarre to me . 
  how is it strange ? 
  the anti-immigration parties are mainly against non-eea immigration . 
  and if non-eea immigrants are an economic burden , then it does make sense to be against that without being a nationalist . 
  so because someone is :  white , working class males and the elderly . 
  he must feel left behind and unsure about their identity ? 
  why do these groups of people tend to be upset ? 
   nearly all of them draw their biggest support from white , working class males and the elderly . 
  and then  and if your party largely consists of a disenfranchised working class youth , the poor and the elderly ? 
   because , as i said the voter demographic is a pretty good way to determine what a party actually stands for . 
  and if your party largely consists of a disenfranchised working class youth , chances are that the party is pursuing nationalist policies . 
  ( which was what you asked me in the first place , why i claimed that they are national socialists ) . 
  wait , when did `` white , working class and elderly '' become `` disenfranchised working class youth '' ? 
  is the study differentiating between eea immigrants and non-eea immigrants , because i seriously doubt non-eea immigrants have a positive contribution in germany either . 
   refugees and immigrants are two separate issues and conflating them only serves the purpose of misinformation . 
  the net effect on the country is rather similar , and it 's hard to deny that many economic migrants travel to europe under the guise of being a refugee . 
   that the established media ca n't be trusted , that our governments are `` run by america '' and that we consequently should seek closer ties to russia ( a lot of `` eurosceptic '' parties receive russian funding [ 1 ] ) , that climate change is n't real ( ukip ) , that their country is being bought up by israel ( jobbik ) and so on . 
  so only one major party ( fn ) is actually receiving russian money ?

  oh , conscription robs another year , of course . 
  just as there ca n't be any violations of rights of sexual minorities because gays do n't exist in russia , they are purely a western phenomenon . 
  and soviet union had it even better , they did n't even have disabled people ( yes , it was an official position , even moscow 1980 did n't host paralympics for that reason ) . 
  what a paradise , i must say . 
  dat horror , cyrillic estonian , delete it , now !!, 
  only poland does n't have uninvited guests acting like occupants like we do :(, 
  well , i meant that it actually should be a goal for eu to reduce the huge wealth gaps . 
  the measures for this ... 
  i 'm not too sure . 
  structural funds are great because they fund mainly infrastructure which is underdeveloped in cee , and the use of these needs to be transparent . 
  in a way , these * could * be increased , because currently , less than 1 % of eu 's gdp is redistributed and even that is not only solely towards poorer countries as countries like france benefit immensely from cap funds . 
  on the other side , the beneficiary countries might get too dependant on the funds . 
  however , i also find it necessary to develop the common market . 
  so that products and services sold on the market enter the eu at once , not each country separately . 
  it 's difficult to do , but not impossible . 
  what is more , the availability of capital could be easier , so it would n't be a vicious cycle where germany as the most trusted country always gets the cheapest credit , while the periphery has the opposite situation . 
  another important factor could be a common energy market , so that natural resources could not be used as a political weapon to divide eu . 
  there is actually a lot to do , but let 's just say not all eu countries are interested in these . 
   what do you mean by that exactly ? 
  this :  i can honestly not see how it is the eu that needs to fund to raise the wealth in living standard in romania , why and how the eu should heal the wounds of 50 years of communism then . 
   also this is not about millions . 
  on another page : what is your better solution to solving the refugee problem other than distributing it fairly across the eu ? 
  physically blocking entrance to europe , refusing to accept anyone else but documented war refugees , mainly syrians ( preferably from camps in syria 's neighbouring countries ) , definitely not the ` come here , you are welcome ' policy ( if germany wants to do it , it may , but it has no rights to start forcing the same ideology to rest of eu ) , cutting benefits to migrants . 
  what else ? 
  sending migrants back , start arresting illegals ( because how the hell is it normal that when a legal russian citizen , for example , wants to make a tourist trip to a neighbouring eu , has to apply for schengen visa , pay for it , give a lot of personal details , including fingerprints , and then they get to temporarily visit the eu , yet thousands of people without any documents whatsoever , with completely random backgrounds , can * illegally * enter eu and they get free housing , food , healthcare etc for it ?! ) . 
  and then , if all the economic migrants are pushed out , the flow stopped , should we share the true refugees between eu countries . 
  otherwise , it 's just a never-ending crisis with no trust for the quotas because we do n't see the end of it . 
  so , you see no reason for eu to actually help its own citizens , but accepting millions of non-europeans should be something mandatory . 
  did you miss the * european * union here ? 
   they also work harder than the slaves if so , why do n't you accept all 5 million of them ? 
  5 million hard-working employees contributing to german economy , such a success story . 
   dont pay anymore money to ukraine apart from small aid packages to ukraine , the eu has contributed next to nothing financially to ukraine ( and even here , germany contributes less than half ) . 
   get good relations with russia oh , look . 
  a human rights violating , neighbour-invading autocratic regime which murders journalists , oppositionists , oppresses minorities , shoots down passenger planes etc is totally ok to have good relations with , because germany gets cheap gas . 
  yet look at those evil poles not accepting forced migrants , such nazis !, 
  statistics are such a nice thing to use to manipulate the facts . 
  first of all , migrants always concentrate in larger cities ( and in eu 's case , that is wealthy western/northern european ones ) and if there 's already a migrant community somewhere , they 'll go there . 
  so that ' 1 % ' will most likely turn into ' 5 % ' or ' 10 % ' on the local level . 
  second of all , out of those ' 5 million people ' , the vast majority are young males ( and muslims ) . 
  that means we 'd have : a ) these people bringing their familiy with them , so 5 million would become more b ) people with no families , meaning millions of single people , potentially also unemployed , uneducated , poor etc. 
  isis would look like a hell of a career to some in such situation , i am afraid . 
  thirdly , 1 % of population is still * a lot * . 
  eu 's population grows by about a million a year , or about 0.2 % . 
  part of this is people born in europe and not migrants . 
  what is more , those 5 million are not the end of refugees/migrants . 
  syria is one conflict , but middle east and africa will stay very violent places and we already have libya etc. 
   your going to have to compare it with an european country with alot of muslims , for example cyprus with about 20 % muslim pop. , but we all know cyprus is a land in chaos and `` constant fighting '' it 's a country where muslims and christians have been divided by splitting the country with a huge demilitarized zone with un peacekeepers , also leaving many towns there completely abandonded . 
  cyprus is one of the worst examples in the world to show `` success '' in integrating muslims . 
   it was signed and agreed to by moldovan government . 
  you dont get to rename it into invasion just because you dont like it . 
  moldova has repeatedly asked russia to withdraw its troops . 
  of course it wo n't . 
  or is it the russian logic again that treaties and agreements are to be respected only as long as it suits kremlin ? 
   eu commission says it was georgia that started that war . 
  i guess you know better . 
  it depends how you view it . 
  if georgia took action on its own territories , it should n't be provocation . 
  unless it has foreign troops there , of course . 
   finally . 
  my question would be what led to that involvement ? 
  or are you implying that putin just woke up one morning and decided to invade ? 
  the point was that ukraine was shifting to the west and propaganda stories were made out how nazis came to power that want to massacre local russians . 
  i see no reasons not to use same rhetorics again in latvia , for example . 
   rebels captured buks from ukraine before the incident . 
  and shot down several military planes in the region just days before the mh17 incident . 
  was n't russia 's position that it was actually ukrainian military jets taking the passenger plane down ? 
  now when it 's proven it was a buk , it suddenly became `` captured from ukraine '' . 
  seriously , how can anyone take that shit even seriously ? 
   im kinda disappointed you didnt try to defend his `` vetoed projects '' ... was genuinely interested if there even is such a thing . 
  i 'd rather not because i 'm not familiar with the topic . 
  looking at statistics regarding integration of migrants , sweden performs poorly - unemployment rate is several times higher among foreigners and there are also big differences in pisa test results , reflecting a gap already among pupils . 
  these are actually one of the worst indicators in europe . 
  what is more , there is increasing violence in immigrant areas , many people from sweden joining isis , surge in religious extremists etc. 
  in that situation , i can not comprehend how not limiting immigration is not on the table . 
  even the nordic neighbours have taken bold steps to deal with the problem . 
  considering i actually do n't like sd at all , this is a bad situation , but it 's not surprising to see sd tipping up each month as the migration crisis in europe ( but also in sweden ) is worsening . 
   how many ? 
  let 's see now , to keep it simple , let 's only include russia after collapse of soviet union . 
  moldova in 1992 . 
  `` peacekeeping '' forces aka protecting the soviet leftover pseudo-state , of course strongly aligned to moscow and russian-speaking . 
  georgia in 2008 . 
  occupied two regions and cut them away from georgia , of course with heavily pro-russian regimes . 
  ukraine in 2014 . 
  occupied and annexed crimea , involved in eastern ukraine . 
  chechnya can be kept out because it 's not a country today . 
  so , 3 at least . 
   you mean the tribunal that would politicize the tragedy even more ? 
  yes , what a sad tragedy . 
  the fact that russia armed terrorists with militay equipment so they 'd be able to do that is no biggie . 
  it was an accident after all . 
  germany has voluntarily accepted turks , while estonia unwillingly experienced mass immigration during occupation . 
  places that never had a significant amount of russians suddenly became fully russian-speaking . 
  there were several towns during occupation where estonians were not allowed to move into , while russian immigrants were brought instead . 
  it was basically ethnic cleansing , only instead of killing the people , they were either deported or just not allowed to return . 
  no reparations , no responsibility from anyone , not even an apology . 
  instead , we 're almost labelled nazis for not accepting these people as natives . 
  meanwhile , finno-ugric nations in russia * do * live in their native lands , and yet are dying out quicker than ever . 
  note that estonia is supposed to be a nation state , while russia multi-ethnic federation . 
  spot the irony ? 
  what i 'm saying is , that there should be at least some level of fairness for estonians .

  is this real ? 
  i thought they made it up for the encino man ... 
  substance abuse is a very big problem in estonia . 
  there is a very high rate of death from overdosing on fentanyl ( if i know the name of the drug correctly ) and hiv from shared needles . 
  this is mostly concentrated in younger population in north-eastern part of the country and areas of tallinn . 
  other illegal substances i have no real clue about , but i know they are used on parties and some say that drugs are very easily available . 
  i do n't know , i have never needed to find some . 
  in addition , we have a big problem with alcohol . 
  this is more common in rural areas and among older generation . 
  as much as i have seen , younger people do n't drink so much , but there is still the common problem of drunk driving ( resulting in crash and deaths ) and drunk swimming ( resulting in drowning ) . 
  i 'm sorry i can not provide any actual numbers or sources ... 
  miilits ( soviet police ) , kotionu ( bagman ) ... not my parents , but my granny did sometimes . 
  * tapa - `` kill '', 
  a toast taught to me by a soldier : to our wives and girlfriends , and may they never meet !, 
   people say that the nazis were worse than the soviets . 
  the nazis burnt books , changed history , wanted to wipe out ethnic groups and cultures , taught propaganda at school , controlled the media and people did n't have freedom of speech . 
  you 're saying this as if soviet system did n't do every one of those things . 
  sometimes this , sometimes the other . 
  my son prefers barefoot , my mom in slippers , my father in socks ... 
  so everything is represented , 
  very common , we call them metsmaasikad - literally forest strawberries . 
  common in estonia as well . 
  estonia , if i can choose my current residence , but czech republic if not . 
  i 've visited there and it 's nice - very european and homely at the same time . 
  the language is strange , but i 'm sure i would be able to learn it with some effort . 
  there are some people saying that we should not sign border treaty with russia without claiming back [ lands we lost with wwii ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/estonia_in_world_war_ii#/media/file:baltic_states_borders.jpg ) , but everyone knows that it is unrealistic to think of trying to retrieve these . 
  also , e-residency is kind of idea of greater estonia , is n't it ? 
  to create stronger ties between people not living here with estonia ... 
  i might be non-typical estonian . 
  i work whenever and wherever i want . 
  in the official time-reporting i insert numbers that project managers want to see , but these numbers have no real connection to reality . 
  the manager just cares that everything is done in reasonable time ; no need for tagumikutunnid ( ass hours or sitting hours ) to be filled . 
  officially , i should work 40/hr a week and do overtime when needed with 1,5 x pay . 
  i usually work less , but with agreement with my manager i have at times done some overtime work when several projects have had hard deadlines . 
  when i am travelling , each day i get 32-50 $ on top of my salary . 
  i get 35 days a year of paid vacation time , which must include at least one vacation that is at least 2 weeks long and this time should be used up by second year ( so for example if i do n't take a vacation this year , i can take 70 days vacation next year , but if i still do n't take vacation next year , i can not take 105 days vacation the year after ) . 
  in addition there are 3 days a year paid for that i can just call in sick without any doctor 's slip . 
  there are a few co-workers i do hang out outside of work as we have kind of befriended , but that 's an exception . 
  a few times a year there are organized team events by the company where i participate . 
  most people bring a cake or something on their birthday and we eat it together in the kitchen area in the office . 
  i was recently visiting croatia for work and i was really surprised by the custom of people working in office taking the time from their day twice a day to go drink coffee in a cafeteria ( and smoke , which is not so nice ) in addition to their lunch . 
  for us , yes we drink lots of coffee throughout the day , but it 's mostly the cup of coffee at our desk or in kitchen area between meetings . 
  coffee shops/cafeterias not so much . 
  i really love our s\u00fclt ( unless it is very fatty ) , although i did n't as a child ... 
  i gag at boiled cabbage , carrots or , worst of all , turnip , so many stews and soups are totally disgusting for me . 
  cabbage soup , \u00fchepajatoit ( `` one-pot-food '' which is whatever vegetables and a little meat as a stew ) , cabbage or carrot pies , to list a few . 
  i just took the upper-right character on my keyboard , then center-leftmost , then next at upper right , next at left center row etc until i had `` paosid '' and then it seemed a good idea to put `` la '' in the end . 
  social liberalism, 
  - good boy/girl/dog !, 
  i trust the public broadcast pretty well , more careful about clickbait in privately owned media . 
  i avoid completely a few that are known to be propaganda of certain party or country . 
  i use reddit to get my international news ( not that interested in all the details there ) . 
  is he lying or does he actually believe that he can do it ? 
  him actually objectively being able to or not is beside the point . 
  i had an american friend who went to university in estonia and he mentioned often that he was the only one in class to ask questions and try to have a discussion with the teacher and he was pretty bummed about it . 
  i like also how this attitude reflects in the culture of entrepreneurship and having an agenda or fighting for a cause . 
  you can curse trump all you want ( i do n't like him either ) , but his attitude of `` i can do it , i can make america great again ! '', 
  is really admirable . 
  i switched schools when i was 13 and at school parties there were bottles passed around that were half ( cheap ) rum in coca cola bottles and half vodka in sprite bottles . 
  in estonia , most known conspiracy theories are about how the [ ferry ms estonia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ms_estonia ) was sunk by some deliberate explosion .

  it might be free ; there might be pretty good coverage ; there are even special bus lanes on bigger streets ... 
  yet most people still prefer having a car . 
  it was a revelation at one point when i realized how much more i can get done just by having a car . 
  it takes me 15 minutes to drive to work ( 20 if i drop off my son to school as well ) , but it would take me 45 minutes to get there by public transit - and that only in case i get to the bus stop at the time the bus comes 2-3 times an hour . 
  sure , it 's possible without a car if you only go back and forth each day , but if you have more need to get around , it 's better to have a car . 
  hey another redditor living in the same area !, 
  you forgot to mention that it is 10-15min drive from the city centre ( if there are n't significant traffic jams ) . 
  i do feel some connection . 
  i 'm glad that we are independent now , but i definitely feel more familiar with swedish , danish , german and even other ex-soviet countries than , say , french or italians who never came that far . 
  that is not to say that we are very similar with , say , romania , but some common experiences make me feel closer to them .

  countries where i would like to go back to experience other parts than i have seen so far . 
  for example , in italy , i have only visited milan ; in france and germany only southern part , in uk only london etc. 
  and , looking at the thread , i think it would be interesting if it would be made into a map - how many mentions any country gets throughout this thread .

  because as also a border country , a massive border upgrade program that started last year and which costs 70 mio $ , clearly is n't what eu really wants . 
  just a few examples what 's being done with estonian-russian border : * [ logging operations ] ( http://g4.nh.ee/images/pix/900x600/qdjhrejoay0/raadamine-eestivene-piiri-lahedal-72871135.jpg ) to make the border guardable and visible * [ new infrastructure ] ( http://f2.pmo.ee/f/2016/05/06/5345075t100h82ca.jpg ) for border guards * [ new border posts ] ( http://g4.nh.ee/images/pix/520x360/dmwv1p1tpsm/eesti-vene-kontrolljoonele-paigaldati-esimene-piiripost-72977969.jpg ) * [ modern border crossing points ] ( http://p.ocdn.ee/40/i/2015/7/20/s3nbmg0d.ydj.jpg ) etc. 
  but hey , obviously protecting the border is not a priority for eu . 
  we should actually allow all illegal immigrants in and then start forcing those illegals onto rest of the eu . 
  i 'm sure portugal and greece have nothing against that / s , and even eastern europe ( or new members ? ), 
  are not a single constant bloc . 
  meanwhile , we have incredibly inefficient cap funding , but obviously cutting that would result in new riots in france or sth like that , so nobody dares to touch that . 
  i do n't know , the russian sanctions have hurt us way more than other eu states and yet we have continued to support them ( unlike several western european countries , where cheap gas apparently comes before international law ) . 
  do n't try to take moral high ground here . 
   i have n't heard anything from the eastern emu members but stonewalling . 
  that 's not entirely true , hungary has definitely offered many plans ( and ironically , their wall-building policy has been adopted by others , despite calling them nazis first ) . 
  i remember v4 also proposing something . 
  baltics , unfortunately , have been very silent on this , but they 're also very tiny countries that are reliable on eu . 
  have n't seen really any portuguese ideas , and spain has n't been that supportive of permanent refugee quotas either ( and i mean with over 20 % unemployment rate , i would n't either ) . 
  it 's easy to form a bloc of countries and call them whatever you want , but the `` brilliant '' ideas i mentioned have more than enough opposition in rest of eu too . 
  i mean , should we even mention uk ? 
   demolished hmm ... 
  i think this tells all about russian media . 
  it 's absolutely fine and in one piece , just relocated into a cemetary . 
  and in a rather prominent location , might i add . 
  go [ check it out ] ( https://www.google.com/maps/@59.4210348,24.7656636,3a,75y,356.45h,64.91t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1s4-qu2bybdvfch9a8vyvlka!2e0!7i13312!8i6656!6m1!1e1 ) on google maps . 
  i only showed you all the other polls done at that time , i know you like to cherrypick the most suitable of those , but not all showed such results . 
  and it still stays clear that estonians always supported relocation . 
  let me add you one more scientific one : [ p\u00e4rnu postimees writing of tns emor polling ] ( http://dea.digar.ee/cgi-bin/dea?a=d&amp;d=parnupostimees20070508.1.8# ) : 82 % of estonians supported government 's actions during relocating the monument , 84 % of russians opposed . 
  do n't even try to portrait here like government acted against people 's will . 
  they did n't . 
  in fact , they had the most support of estonians from any government of re-indpenendent estonia . 
  what happened there was foreigners trying to force their will onto estonians , and when they could n't do that , they became violent . 
   it also mentions one more survey done 1 month before the riots -- with the same results . 
  i mentioned the same survey as you already brought it out . 
  and no , the 1-month earlier did n't have same results , russians ' opposition had increased ( as a result of massive russian propaganda ) over month . 
  so please , do n't try to even act like you know what 's happening in estonia or what estonians think . 
   solidarity seems like a code for `` me , myself and i '' over there . 
  so what kind of `` solidarity '' has been offered lately ? 
  give up your sovereignity over deciding who comes to your country and we 'll apply the `` totally succesful-only-slighly-extremist '' western european immigration to you !, 
  which a country like estonia that already has horrible experience with unwilling mass immigration of foreigners , surely adores , right ? 
  i mean , i think estonia should help with refugees ( estonians were also refugees in wwii ) , but i sure as hell have absolutely no trust in brussels over its immigration policies ( the city itself is ironically one of the worst examples ) and i certainly do n't see how forcing immigrants onto countries would help convincing the public . 
  nor was germany 's `` let 's invite all the people here , oh we ca n't take them all ? 
  europe help , do your part !!! '', 
  very clever . 
  pay for greece 's , banks and troika 's horrible decisions with your tax money !, 
  all of that mess has been a disaster . 
  a disaster so bad i think would rank one of the peace-time most financially destructive for developed countries ever . 
  a sensible person would n't even touch that mess . 
  maybe if there was actually a sensible plan ( let 's directly invest in greece so it actually produces something and money does n't go to the bottomless pit so many billions have been thrown already ) , i 'd support it . 
  so far , the two examples have been so bad that it 's difficult to think one can make so bad decisions in europe in 21st century . 
  and from the same eesti p\u00e4evaleht article where estonians supported and russians did n't : `` estonians ' opinion had not changed in a month while as a result of massive russian propaganda , opposition among russian speakers rose sharply '' . 
  [ saar poll ] ( http://www.saarpoll.ee/userfiles/file/integratsioonipoliitika_valjakutsed.pdf ) : `` was relocating bronze soldier justified ? 
  '' : estonians : yes 79 % russians : yes 11 % so it was clear vast majority of estonians ( ~ 80 % ) were for relocating the monument . 
  it was n't for nothing that the supporting party 's popularity rose after that to highest level one party had ever had in ( post-ussr ) estonia . 
   maybe , just maybe that has something to do with ignoring opinion of significant part of your population ? 
  yes , we totally should succumb to foreigners ( who follow putin 's russia media 24/7 ) and not allow our nation to even decide what happens in our own capital ( ! ) . 
  do you understand that ussr was occupier for majority of this country ? 
  that is responsible for tens of thousands of deaths , refugees , deportees etc ? 
  we have no obligation to respect it on any level . 
  and ussr is n't linked with russians by default . 
  if those soviet immigrants feel so closely linked with it and think of it as liberator and find our decisions uncomfortable , they should consider leaving . 
  if they attack us because of that , they behave like occupants themselves . 
  although i do think it was quite symbolic considering they only behaved like many of their ancestors ( red army ) before . 
   it objectively has a weak social safety net , nowhere close the nordic model . 
  yes , hence the `` heading '' . 
   pensions are wage-based , so you would expect high pensions in places with historically high wages . 
  okay , pensions are high because ` they 're used to it ' , rather than because they 've money for it . 
  like that ? 
   the vast majority of developed nations are service economies driven by domestic demand . 
  germany is really the exception to the rule ( being driven by exports , although it also has a large service sector ) , and the poorer oecd members in e europe are really still catching up . 
  yes , that 's quite a common knowledge , what i meant is that industry still has an important role in ( most ) developed economies and easily makes up 20 % -30 % of gdp ( in greece , just 13 % according to wikipedia ) . 
   you can basically make a list of why any country 's economy is shit and will never succeed etc. 
  i mean have you seen the oecd recommendations for germany ? 
  they 're a mile long . 
  do these countries also rank up in the bottom in so many indicators ? 
   like , look at estonia . 
  probably the lowest productivity in the eurozone that keeps its people trapped in low-paying jobs , slow productivity gains , low prosperity , its pre-crisis growth was driven by cheap loans by scandinavian banks rather than the real economy , most of its industry is labour-intensive with low value-added and virtually no growth potential due to asian competition and automation ... 
  i could go on . 
  a lot of those problems are true , being the middle-man , rarely producing finished goods , low productivity etc , though i 'd argue against `` asian competition and automatization '' because estonia with a tiny ( rather poor ) market , but cheap energy and educated workforce is able to profit from automatization more than most others . 
   it 's a nice narrative but also one that completely obscures the real reasons for the situation greece finds itself in today . 
  so yes , the debt burden has definitely hurt the economy a lot and is keeping investments away , but did n't greece kinda get into such position by overspending in the first place ? 
  and ineffectively collecting taxes , not reforming the economy etc ? 
  indeed , and i have no idea how they are planning to keep going like this . 
  because i can assure that if this runs like they plan ( aka let 's make eurozone taxpayers pay ) , support wo n't last long even in estonia , the most euro-supportive country so far . 
  greek bailout was supposed to be a bailout , not a debt reduction on the expense of rest of the eurozone , though . 
  the haircut should have been done immediately when it came clear greece could n't pay it ( i know something was done , but it clearly was n't enough ) . 
  sorry , but if eurozone is about lying and shifting private creditor 's responsibility onto taxpayers , it is a very shitty one to be in . 
  and the eu budget transfers , which make up less than 1 % of eu gdp , also covers what western european companies gained when eastern ones had to remove all their trade barriers and open their markets . 
   you have a weaker safety net due to low taxation taxation here is not that low and the government is heading towards nordic system anyway . 
  also , greece has that annoying problem of tax evasion , which is way smaller here . 
   plus your gdp was nowhere near the greek gdp ten or twenty or thirty years ago does this even matter here ? 
  i mean , if greece would have collected a huge fund in all that time from where it pays pensions and took money from it later , then sure , but afaik , that 's not the case , it comes directly from budget . 
  correct me if i 'm wrong here . 
   and again , greek productivity is substantially higher compared to estonian productivity ( or at least was in 2012 , i do n't have more recent data ) , which is why both their wages and pensions have historically been higher . 
  does n't productivity mean how much added value is generated per employee ? 
  i really do n't see how that 's relevant here considering it does n't just make all the unemployed people go away . 
  they also need social transfers and do n't contribute themselves , so that means less money for pensioners anyway . 
   comparing greece to slovakia is comparing apples and oranges . 
  comparing them on exports is especially counterproductive since greece is n't export-oriented to begin with while slovakia has basically turned itself ( rather foolishly , might i add ) into a german subcontractor for semi-finished products . 
  it 's not like industrial exports are the be-all and end-all . 
  not always , but in most cases , industry does play a very important role in developed countries ' economies . 
  slovakia 's dependance on car production might be problematic , but at least all that shows that their country 's business climate is good for investments . 
   china is the world 's top exporter whereas uk economy is basically 80 % services and i 'd still rather be british than chinese . 
  london is basically the financial capital of the world , what does greece have ?

  showing the '' % who believe in god '' alone is possible however . 
  that 's all meant by it . 
  yeah , that was n't directed at you specifically . 
  and the good book says it 's good !, 
  except being religious ** is a problem ** , therefore ridiculing people who keep indoctrinating their innocent children ** is necessary ** !, 
  you :  `` is this the right time and place to do so ? '', 
  me : / did he really ask this from a person commenting on an online forum ? 
  / answers with sarcasm . 
  you : / not get sarcasm , get insulted , insult back . 
   but your will to live is irrational , because there 's no point of life . 
  lol . 
   your will is as irrational as a will of a religious person to believe in god . 
  all creatures live . 
  that 's the whole point of life . 
  yet god is an invention . 
   your family feelings do n't matter too , because their lives are as pointless as your life . 
  pointless to whom ? 
  for the universe ? 
  sure . 
  for the man kind ? 
  i 'm sure they 've contributed enough to not be considered pointless . 
  my life ? 
  yeah , my subjective feelings towards my family and friends , whom i will hurt should i end my life . 
  what 's there to get ? 
   arguing with religious people does n't help too , because this argue is pointless too and therefore irrational . 
  next you 'll say religion is pointless and prove my point ...  so , by even not committing suicide , you make yourself irrational . 
  i do n't think you understand what those words mean . 
  that `` problem '' only exists in your religiously indoctrinated mindset . 
  other people see a reason to live by default . 
  the shittiest of all store chains in estonia . 
  except for maxima perhaps . 
  let 's say , the bing bang theory ... damm it , who set the explosives ? 
  maybe there is something or someone beyond that ? 
  sure , it 's not known . 
  but to conclude the existence of some magical being out of it is just too far-fetched . 
  all magic that has ever been revealed has turned out to be ... not magic . 
  just because i do n't know how something works , does n't mean it 's magic . 
  well it 's nothing so unbelievable , 
  both perhaps ? 
   `` is this the right time and place to do so ? '', 
  oh no , i apologize for arguing on an online forum ... 
  because i want to live ? 
  because killing myself would cause pain to my friends and family ? 
  there are plenty of reasons to live , gosh . 
  like for example to argue with religious people   we will know first handed what happens with our minds when we die . 
  how do you know that ? 
  although is n't spaghetti just a metaphor for a snake ? 
  i think they even make the same sounds . 
  of course , but it 's rather a stupid comparison . 
  this excludes all the people , who believe in a god . 
  either compare the number of people , who believe in god , or the number of people , who do n't believe in a god nor in some other life force . 
  but comparing the middle really shows you nothing . 
   what about things that lie beyond , which we ca n't see or measure ? 
  how do you know they exist if you can not see or measure it ? 
   just because we ca n't see it , does n't mean it does not exist . 
  well yeah , but why believe there is a flying spaghetti monster around the corner if there 's most likely not . 
   to see things beyond we need to use inductive reasoning , to speculate on matters to which science ca n't ( yet ? ), 
  reach . 
  there are no matters of fact that science can not reach . 
  there are only opinions of different values . 
  and values do n't create facts . 
   we may for example be living in a computer simulation , much like the matrix . 
  sure , but why take a strange blue or red pill without having any evidence to conclude that we live inside a matrix ? 
   we would n't really have any way of knowing what the ` actual ' world looked like unless the creator ( s ) would somehow communicate with us . 
  but why believe there is a creator before having any evidence to conclude that there is ? 
   in that case would n't the architect , the programmer , of our reality be - in effect - god ? 
  sure . 
   according to you , anyone even considering that possibility is unintelligent . 
  no , i would n't say that . 
  but reaching a conclusion without evidence makes one unintelligent   but to be so narrowminded as to reject even the possibility i do n't think many irreligious people do that , including me . 
   as a result claiming to be superior to those that do believe is in my opinion the true sign on unintelligence . 
  i do n't claim to be superior to those who believe because of my lack of belief . 
  i claim to be superior than them because of their belief . 
  do n't you get it ? 
  ** belief without evidence is unintelligent !, 
  before i started these internet discussions about religion as a teenager , i thought that there is too little evidence for the existence of god or any aspect of faith to be true . 
  i quickly discovered that there really is in fact no evidence whatsoever . 
  i think you missed the point perhaps ? 
  the latvian was referring to the fact that the two parties in the discussion both filled the stereotype of the estonian being irreligious and the pole being religious . 
  i said i would like to see the contra-stereotypical version of this as i 'm sure there are religious people in estonia and irreligious people in poland . 
  ah , another classic . 
  i must have an inferiority complex if i think believing in magical things without any evidence is stupid . 
  yes , because they believe in magical stories without any evidence . 
  how can these people be normal ? 
   but i will always defend the people 's right to belief ; so will i. 
   just how i will always stand against people calling religion `` fairy-tales '' and i will always remain a person , who calls religion `` fairy-tales '' . 
   it 's a very weak way to belittle people 's choice to believe in something you personally do n't . 
  i do n't belittle their right to a choice , i belittle their unintelligent choice . 
  but i have a rational reason for calling a person , who believes in magical things without evidence `` dumb '' . 
  you do n't have a rational reason for that fedora argument . 
  if i claim that i believe in the flying spaghetti monster , you do n't think that i am childish ? 
  well if that 's the criteria ... 
  i would really love to see the same discussion between a devout lutheran estonian and an atheist pole . 
   or perhaps religious people in your country are very backward . 
  i would n't actually say that . 
   religious nowadays is not a dogma u need to follow so hard otherwise u are excomunicated , threatened to burn in hell or stigmatized in the community . 
  and i did n't mean it is . 
  but cherrypicking what fairy tales and ancient dogmas suit you does n't make it that much better - you still choose to believe in magic that has zero evidence to support it . 
  you believe in magical things that have zero evidence to support them and you say it 's ridiculous that i call it unintelligent ? 
  i consider religious people intellectually at least a bit inferior , not myself superior for being a normal person , gosh ...

  plus , no wonder it became extremely popular after the russian invasion . 
   as for the crimean tatars , their situation at least did n't got worse : their language was not officially recognized , not it is . 
  even if you think that this is just a formality , in ukraine they were not allowed to have it . 
  of course it got worse , they were under an illegal foreign dictatorship , which closed their assembly and harasses their political figures . 
  i am not talking about biology , of course they are humans . 
  i am talking about their social status and how the rest of us should treat them . 
  yeah , because the serbs were trying to wipe out almost every non-serb population in former yugoslavia . 
   going to church is like a fancy live show . 
  you ca n't use your phone in the theater , can you ? 
  the theater is dark and you will ruin the experience for others . 
  ca n't see the same being a problem in a church . 
  and as much as i know , lutheran services are n't really `` fancy live shows '' either . 
  lol , blaming it on state capitalism . . 
  should you be wearing a protective helmet and your huge backpack , then there 's virtually no way you can hit anything while lying on the ground . 
  your best chances are on your knee . 
  standing up shooting position is also impossible as you ca n't really raise your arms that high with that packpack . 
   i 'm guessing finnish boys are raised on skis or something from a young age . 
  well that was very much so in estonia and finland for a long time , but city life has its disadvantages and fewer and fewer boys ever ski . 
   in america , skiing is a novelty that usually only wealthy people pursue . 
  because the rich do it only down the hill . 
  cross-country skiing is a bit different thing , 
   turns out skiing is way easier than trying to wade your way through waist deep snow in similar conditions . 
  oh of course , would still use skis when the snow is more than 30-40 cm deep . 
  `` no , your governments did . 
  you did n't have a referendum ! '', 
  i believe as in estonia there 's a problem nowadays that not many young men know how to ski . 
  they may know the basics , but they lack the balance . 
  i had this same problem myself . 
  all is fine on a road with pressed snow , but try skiing with that equipment through thick snow and up or down some hills and through bushes and you 'll find soon enough that an advanced ape is not made for this shit . 
  this thing is not a joke , skiing with that heavy equipment is quite difficult . 
  getting back up even more so , 
  why the heck ? 
  i mean , honestly asking , i have been to one ceremony ( a church wedding ) in my life and nobody cared about phones . 
  some were filming if i recall correctly . 
  you are clearly naive . 
   if you are not achieving what you hoped for and you are even harmed than no shame to give up ( especially in politics where deals are changed all the time ) i have achieved everything i wanted here - which was to argue against your idiotic arguments . 
   so russia is criminal state so what with exception of few really democratic western nations all other countries are either criminal or fuc.ked up in different ways . 
  so you can start sanctioning majority of countries based on some good reason . 
  of course there are many criminal states out there , but not many in the scale that russia is a criminal state . 
  in the course of this young century there have n't been any other illegal land grabs as much as i know , at least not to this scale . 
   i gave you arguments , you just don t like them . 
  finally you are getting it . 
  it 's not like every argument is an adequate argument . 
   no point for discussion on this topic any further . 
  i wonder if you have been calling all week to turkish embassy that you want explanation for their actions or if you were angry for yours on your strongest ally for their actions in middle east . 
  why would i be calling their embassy ? 
   i guess not , because you care only about russia and putins regime and how evil their government is right . 
  now that is just bs . 
  of course i care more about many other world issues , but most other such issues do n't have naive people from democratic countries defending the dictatorships and wanting to resort to an ill-fated appeasement policy . 
   world is not black and white . 
  of course , but how is this relevant ? 
   should we work with them anyway ? 
  yes no , we should not . 
  exclusion from world affairs is the thing russia with its need for a mighty status would not want to see happening . 
   how i said you if you want to do only the right and moral thing than you , can cooperate with only few western countries , maybe up to 7 , 8 , rest of the governments have their hands also dirty with terrible things ( some more , some less ) 7-8 countries are n't imperialist dictatorships that violently breach international law and steal territories from other countries ? 
  wow , i did not know that actually . 
  how did i insult you ? 
  i do n't know , rapists , xenophobes , murderers , gangsters etc are all subhumans to me , i do n't see what 's so wrong ( or even so extraordinary ) in stating that . 
   i gave many reasons , not maybe in 1 post rather multiple posts , because i was reacting on more people . 
  none of them were adequate and i argued against them . 
   but right now in 2nd half of 2016 it is pointless . 
  nothing changed , russian position won t change based on our sanctions ( and it s not like we can get much tougher sanctions , technically we can , but it would be very bad for every side ) . 
  yeah , and us changing the sanctions is giving up , rather pathetically and playing the victory into russian hands . 
   russian policy didnt change ( just like everyone with brain expected ) , yes sanctions did little bit harm ( but it was actually dip in oil price that harmed russian economy ) than followed inflation and , because they weren t prepared for sanctions also that had some influence in short term in long term it was oil price , tensions between russia and west that made russian rating 2nd class , less fdi and so on . 
  sanctions make the lives of the russian elite also uncomfortable . 
   so we did the right and moral thing . 
  now it is time to improove ties with russia in order to create much safer world and because we need them/who says no is idiot . 
  they are hydrocarbon superpower and pretty large export and investmemt market for our companies , not even mentioning they still have some limited political influence in certain countries . 
  there should be no free improvement of ties with russia until it stops being a criminal state . 
   some people will say bad evil russia we need sanctions ( bs ) if those people want to argument with justice and what is right than what about erdogan , , saudi arabia and many of western allies who should be on blacklist for million reasons . 
  not bs though . 
   to sanctions itself , if ukraine is the real reason ( which i doubt is only about ukraine ) cooperation with russia is 20x better than isolating them if we truly want to help ukrainians . 
  russia will continue to use cooperation , you seem to be very naive in this context . 
   look crimea is russian , there is nothing anyone can do about that ( and i personally agree with crimea being russian , just not witj circumstances and the way it was done ) basically western leaders are not even talking about it anymore , because everyone know how it is . 
  we can sanction the hell out of it . 
   so to donbass and rest of ukraine that is mess , inflation , gdp on levels of subsaharan africa and so on . . only with russian help we can make sure ukraine won t collapse and we won t have another millions refugees here and 10 million economic migrants here . 
  and already wanting to fulfill russian dreams ...  i have many more argument yet none of them are adequate ...  i meamt that discussion about possibility of russian invasion to estonia we had yesterday why would i be butthurt from such a discussion ? 
  yet the crimean tatars do n't have another homeland , but the russians do , a rather large one ...  after the referendum parliament of crimea declared independence and requested the russian government to admit it into russia . 
  russia did n't annex it , it just let crimea in . 
  lol, 
  for two years in a row , aggressive nations attacked russia . 
  in 1939 it was poland and finland . 
  in 1940 it was romania , estonia , latvia and lithuania . 
  just to clarify , this is an incorrect map . 
  russians did n't control , nor live in eastern estonia at the time . 
  yuryev was not really founded by yaroslav i the wise , it was already an estonian fort named tarbatu . 
  crimean tatars are the most native population this land knows , definitely more than the russians . 
  plus , they do n't have any other native region . 
  you have half a continent for yourselves , why do you need to come and take land away from others ?? 
  yeah , except in our case they are indeed immigrant occupants and in your case they are indigenous minorities without an independent country out there . 
  i am open to normal discussion , i just do n't tolerate empty arguments . 
  what discussion from yesterday ? 
  they were a majority before russia invaded crimea ? 
  german civilians were expelled indeed , whether right or wrong , but germany caused this by being a warmonger , for which of course the ussr should have been punished as well . 
   crimean tatars were expelled because of their mass collaboration with the nazis during ww2 . 
  supporting nazis over soviets was a logical thing to do for many nations . 
  nobody should have been punished for that , especially by deporting the people from their indigenous homeland . 
  that was a soviet crime against humanity , nothing else !, 
   they still have their language as one of the 3 official . 
  those who were deported get payments from the government , so save your tears oh payments , so that makes it all right then !,

  he 'd applied for a tourist visa , not asylum . 
  ... and the time before that . 
  two countries in top 10 with no red in their flags . 
  3 in top 20 , 7 in top 40 . 
  that last one is weaselly as fuck . 
  24-74 % as one color to force a point . 
   regular russian troops only make up part of the opposition forces , where they are more likely to play more technical roles and are more shielded from the direct fighting it appears russian regular forces get used in tougher situations where the usual mercenaries go ` fuck it , you 're not paying us enough ' - like debal ` tseve , and ilovaisk last year . 
  different channel , different company . 
  they ` poached ' john from daily show . 
  that 's not the daily show . 
  nato chief jens stoltenberg says bears shit in woods . 
  russia is afraid it does n't have a future , that 's why all they ever talk about is the past . 
  also the reason why they 're violently against their former subjects having a _ choice _ between the futures on offer - in free market conditions the paucity of what they have to offer is made abundantly clear . 
  a ) ignore it , outright trolling has been a mainstay in russian foreign policy for ages .

  the right of self determination does not have such a precondition . 
  of course there is . 
  you can read about it [ here ] ( http://www.nordicestonia.com ) , [ here ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/culture_of_estonia ) and [ here ] ( http://www.baltic21.org/culture/estonia.html ) for example . 
  what 's wrong with democratic separatist movements in democratic countries ? 
  i mean , many of them still want to be in the eu , just as a separate member state . 
  but why would spain be a dick and veto that ? 
   let 's not talk those countries with independentist regions , they will vote no right away . 
  plain idiotic , against democracy and against the right of self determination that is . 
  stay automatically is one thing , but join in a short while , why not . 
  but it could very well be done automatically as well , if independence will only happen after a transition period and if it will fulfill the eu criteria . 
  i 'm sure that for a region that is already a member of the eu , filling these criteria wo n't be that difficult . 
  yes , but why would a member state use that right ? 
  it does n't matter . 
  `` allowing '' them to go , yet vetoing them from the eu makes it still a dick move . 
  why so ? 
  it would be a dick move to veto them from the eu . 
  is there anyone , who was n't aware of that ? 
  indeed . 
  but it does n't even have to be a large share of these immigrants , just a strong cultural influence . 
  but this is harder to happen for a bigger population . 
  if you live within a population , you can easily recognize some `` types '' , which usually only include people of one ethnic group . 
  for example russian women are often more pale and russian men are often shorter than estonians . 
  no worries , although i have for several times gotten very angry answers from latvians and lithuanians about us not really caring about the baltic ** grouping ** ( not the two countries themselves ) . 
  not labeling us as such definitely does n't mean we think more highly of ourselves or that we dislike the two . 
  do they want to secede from the eu ? 
  a far more populous ( i.e. 
  harder to influence ) country with a strong influence from the normans - i.e. 
  very little scandinavian influence . 
  i do n't think i got this one . 
  which ones are the delusional people ? 
  not just any colony of course , but ones that have been strongly affected by these countries . 
  i think they should be about similar countries . 
  and it should not be about the very same aspects that makes a country scandinavian , otherwise , why do we have two distinct concepts ? 
  similar is historically lutheran northern european regions with a strong scandinavian influence . 
  it should also include both northern germanic and finnic countries at least . 
  most of latvia is another issue , but they see themselves more baltic anyway . 
  we are currently dealing with an administrative reform and you can see both attitudes here - first some are angry because fewer people would find a job in municipal offices now , then others are happy as they consider almost everyone working for the government leeches or something like that . 
  there are all kinds of people ... 
  it is rather interesting indeed . 
  [ this hill ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e0/tallinn_old_city_and_sea_view_two_crop.jpg ) [ [ 2 ] ( http://europetravelz.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/toompea-hill.jpg ) ] has a very long history behind it . 
  it has been the site of the local capital for most likely more than a thousand years and it is thought to be the final resting place of our mythological hero kalev . 
  it 's [ quite distinguishable ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f8/der_dom_zu_reval.jpg ) and it was a separate municipality from the rest of tallinn until the late 19th century . 
  the flag tower in the middle is a national symbol and the flag represents , who is in power in the town . 
  plus , the orthodox church on the left was built as a symbol of russian imperialism on the highest place in the town , next to the government offices ... 
  even today , our parliament and government offices are located on the hill . 
  ok , if you are speaking of a specific country , then of course your criticism may have been well founded . 
  i was rather thinking in general terms as i do n't see managing municipal affairs as being useless , nor stealing . 
  apparently nordic = swedish now . 
  more or less . 
  well , not like the baltics , which is is a matter of geographical oversimplification , considering the major linguistic , cultural , religious and historical divisions within the three states . 
  i never understood this . 
  why is it that every time we mention that we are finnic/nordic people and are not balts and therefore should n't be called baltic , that you take this as a personal insult , that estonians somehow dislike latvians or lithuanians or that we think better of ourselves because of that . 
  it 's just ridiculous , i do n't think estonians think of themselves better than anybody , it 's just that baltic is n't really how we see ourselves . 
  i personally have loads of friends in latvia , more so than in finland , and i go to riga several times a year for weekends and for entire weeks even . 
  yet still i claim that estonians are rather nordic and the concept of the three baltic states is ridiculous for me . 
  are you a lithuanian ? 
  i do n't know why you are hurt ? 
  i never said estonians dislike lithuanians , we rather respect them and consider them good friends . 
  my comment was about historical facts that the two of us have indeed little shared history together , also little shared culture . 
  the local ancient estonian tribe around the modern stronghold was called r\u00e4vala ( latin : revelia ) , the people * r\u00e4valased * ( revelians ) . 
  the stronghold was first mentioned in 1154 by an arab cartographer as ** qlwn ** , which could derive from ** kalevan ** as kalev was an estonian mythological hero , who was thought to have been buried under the toompea hill in tallinn . 
  after the danish conquest of 1219 it was initially called ** lindanise ** , which could derive from the estonian * linn ( us ) danise * , meaning `` danish town ( castle ) '' . 
  the town thereafter surpassed to the low german language livonian order , which called the town ** reval ** after the surrounding region . 
  russians later used the name ** revel ** . 
  the first appearance of tallinna ( initially ** talyna ** ) was in 1536 and it is thought to derive from the same estonian root as lindanise , this time as * taani linna * ( `` danish town '' ) . 
  it is possible that this estonian name survived throughout the previous centuries under german control , only that they were n't mentioned in german language sources . 
  after estonia regained independence the name ** tallinna ** was changed to ** tallinn ** to distinguish it from all other estonian place names , which in their common form are in genitive case and always end with a vocal . 
  tallinn however is the only exception until today that is in nominative case in its common form . 
  ( indeed , only 1 estonian settlement ends with a consonant , the other  4.660 settlements end with a vocal ) . 
  so basically the history of tallinn 's name is a clusterfuck . 
  not sure this is stealing . 
  not sure they are useless either . . 
  of course they are different , on a large part they are a different society within the country with relatively little interaction with estonians other than work . 
  and you can tell on most part , but increasingly less so . 
  in the 90s it was almost impossible not to tell ... 
  but the local russians are more and more like estonians or just westerners in general , so it 's not that easy to tell by looks anymore . 
  facial appearances are n't always so different , but there are some traits by which you could safely guess which ones they are , but such traits are apparent only for a minority of estonians and russians . 
  well , plus danish from 1219 to 1346 and saaremaa from 1570 to 1645 . 
  you not knowing enough about estonia does n't make estonia not nordic though . 
   and some parts of finland have traditionally been more `` swedish '' than `` finnish '' . 
  same applies to estonia . 
  does europe mean the european union country ? 
  thing is that estonia shares a lot of history with latvia , but almost none with lithuania .

  not to mention its pool of resources is a lot more diverse . 
  it 's not only about oil and gas there . 
  norway has managed to collect nearly a trillion euros to its wealth fund and can keep the economy stable even when oil price crashes . 
  i do n't think something similar would be impossible for russia . 
  it would help , too , if a lot of money would n't go to military in order to invade neighbours . 
  wow , such a shocking and unexpected statement . 
  it 's almost as if russia would do 180 and putin and his oligarchs would risk losing power just because trump 's spokeperson told them to . 
  if you claim crimea should be russian , you 'd also need to push for kosovo to be albanian . 
  more like that . 
   it 's vital for russian interests to have control over so called ` buffer states ' now this no , it 's not . 
  russia has more than enough natural resources to provide decent life to all of its citizens . 
  it needs no wars or conflicts with its neighbours which undermines the economy and mobilizes people against the ` common enemy ' , instead of internal reforms . 
  what about returning russia to mongolia ? 
  like the town hall ? 
  sure , [ tartu ] ( http://g1.nh.ee/images/pix/tartu-plats-raekoda-raekoja-69940705.jpg ) has actually a very similar one , just that its old town has largely preserved . 
  oh , and the town government works there as well . 
  because he compared finland 's neighbours ? 
  there certainly is n't another finno-ugric speaking country right across the gulf of finland , which even has some level of mutual intelligbility with finnish . 
  nope , not at all . 
  misleading , it should be 11.4 % because yoy makes much more sense than mom , which is volatile as it is affected by seasons and bonuses . 
  its facade is a negative of the historical [ stock exchange building ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/08/narva_b%c3%b6rsihoone,_sarap.jpg ) ( it basically stands right next to it , so it 's like a mold pressed to the facade ) . 
  it was a bit controversial move because many still want the old town to be restored , but i like it . 
  i mean , i 'd * want * the old town to be restored too , but who 's going to pay for it , who 's going to relocate the current people etc. 
  narva is one of the poorest performing towns of estonia as well . 
  also , integrating elements from the destroyed town , instead of replicating it , might be a great alternative . 
  well , we had a completely different approach here . 
  soviet names were mostly gone already by late 1980s . 
  it was n't difficult to do that anyway , considering we had all-estonian names from 1930s and we just returned those . 
  and it 's not a secret we were n't exactly fans of soviet union either . 
  if you 're fond of finno-ugric names , i suppose you could rename it to * jaama * as finno-ugric natives of ingria used to call it . 
  would still also be recognizable in estonian , meaning `` station 's '' . 
  a rather common street name here , 
  the uk troops have n't arrived yet . 
  russian soldiers can easily go take a picture in ivangorod with narva in the background , does n't bother me . 
  see my [ other comment ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5tlp6g/the_most_german_of_russian_towns_kaliningrad/ddnjoso/ ) on that . 
  it depends on how you take it . 
  considering kaliningrad has an entirely different population , vast majority of buildings and is part of a different country than k\u00f6ningsberg , it makes sense . 
  estonia 's narva has also entirely different population , vast majority of buildings , but it 's still part of estonia and we call it the same . 
  they are now planning to bring the town government back to the [ historical town hall ] ( http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-9ernzywlfom/uilt-zxxwki/aaaaaaaakqm/zqy6ouzvqmy/s1600/img_2206.jpg ) , one of few buildings that has survived . 
  i think this is the easternmost * rathus * of northern europe and is sometimes considered to be the edge of the west . 
  i like narva 's approach more because lack of roots bother me . 
  but i understand it would be weird for both russians and germans with k\u00f6ningsberg . 
  well , i 'm not you , but i 'd rather have historical names . 
  * kingsepp * is a shoemaker in estonian . 
  i do n't think town of kingisepp has much to do with estonia , shoemakers or viktor kingissepp , the estonian commie , though . 
   it is absolutely not normal for fully-armed ** foreign ** soldiers to go around in public and carrying a large foreign flag with them , can you really say they 're foreign if they 're allies and invited by us ? 
   especially since the us is now a country that would like to break up the eu . 
  i do n't see trump 's administration as particularly friendly either , but let 's just not treat them as enemies before anything important has not been broken ? 
  seriously , this bothers me . 
  including the leningrad oblast , like wtf ? 
  what is wrong with st. petersburg oblast ? 
  and all those sovetsk and kaliningrad that are just named after ideology and have no connections to the places at all . 
  there 's even a town of kingisepp in russia , named after estonian communist that participated in soviet-supported attempt of coup d'etat of republic of estonia and was executed . 
  i mean , just why keep it ? 
  i do n't know about you , but at this point , we can easily take decisions which are only in our own interests , and opinion of russia is irrelevant to us . 
  we 're not russia and russia is not estonia . 
  besides , russian media is infamous for its fake stories and general lack of independent reporting . 
  both [ nato ] ( http://www.cbsnews.com/news/james-mattis-defends-nato-calls-russia-a-threat-at-confirmation-hearing/ ) and [ russia ] ( http://www.aljazeera.com/news/europe/2014/12/russia-nato-biggest-threat-20141227164270399.html ) have publicly stated that the other side is now # 1 threat . 
  furthermore , it 's not a secret that conscription remains in countries like estonia or finland mainly because of russia . 
  there are no other real threats for us . 
  so i do n't see the need to pretend . 
  russia is not a partner for us at this point . 
  even if we 'd like it to be . 
  well , okay . 
  the photo in this particular context might not be everyday thing , but in general , taking a photo in that place is rather common . 
  so if you happen to be there even as military brigade , i do n't see what 's wrong with taking the photo . 
  because these are soldiers ? 
  do you get provoked every time you see a soldier somewhere ? 
   i would like to have an estonian patriot give their point on this topic , are you okay with them with this picture and are you okay with them flying the american flag there ? 
  yes ? 
  i mean , they are our allies , why should we be annoyed by them ? 
  we kinda invited them here after russia invaded ukraine . 
  this was specifically a march where american and estonian soldiers walked through north-eastern estonia to improve cooperation and learn how to act in the winter . 
  they also had talks with locals at schools in several towns and local college in narva . 
  this is still part of nato , even if the easternmost extreme point of it . 
  and taking a picture with your own flag on allied territory does n't sound provocative for me . 
  narva is the 3rd largest town in estonia . 
  people need to accept that it 's also part of nato and can easily be included in activities of the alliance . 
  furthermore , this is n't even that much related to military activity , just taking a picture in the town , which is absolutely normal , especially considering the interesting sight of centuries-old castles separated by border . 
  i think this was because of finnish tv . 
  the signal reached northern estonia ( including tallinn ) , so like half of the population could see the evil capitalist commercials . 
  so they needed to strike back and show just how good the soviet products are . 
  who would n't want some * kanahakkliha * ? 
  i think this would go down well on patients of mental asylum . 
  aryans varied depending on who hitler needed as allies . 
  they were n't even sure whether finno-ugric people were europeans until finland became an ally . 
   and here you dismissed the cost of having to fight nazis as irrelevant , for similar reasons . 
  they invaded estonia first and then bombed the entire town of narva down . 
  i do n't think it 's appropriate to put a monument for them here . 
  or to nazis , for that matter . 
  both were invaders and horrible regimes . 
  it 's not really that relevant how much worse one was . 
  they were both enemies of estonia . 
  it 's not even some our perspective of things . 
  they pretty much banned all national symbols and blew up monuments to estonian war of independence ( and sometimes replaced by soviet ones ) . 
  for example , a town in my region [ before ] ( http://www.lossiantiik.eu/epood/media/catalog/product/cache/6/image/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/v/p/vp434.jpg ) and [ after ] ( http://www.monument.ee/lv/rakvere-linn/rakvere-vennashaud/fotod/rakvere-vennashaud-54.jpg ) . 
   `` but nazis did not do anything bad to us '' . 
  i have not claimed that and i do n't agree with that . 
  but neither would i accept any claims of liberation by soviets here . 
   but they did terrible things to other people in other places .

  we do n't have many immigrants except russians and there have been stories in the media for some 10 years now that soon they will come and destroy our country . 
  so now that some refugees are coming people totally freaked out . 
  oh please . 
  we have n't asked for eu help . 
  we are helping greece . 
  defense wise we do n't count on european countries . 
  cv.ee is the most popular . 
  cvkeskus.ee is another . 
  not sure why so few people from finland come here to work . 
  we have companies with people all over the world working for them but almost no finns . 
  are there some pride issues ? 
  i 'm a developer in tallinn . 
  after taxes and rent i 'm left with about 1500 euros . 
  i rent near the old town . 
   eh , sign me up ? 
  estonia is hiring . 
  in tallinn you can ask for more than 1500 euros a month . 
  economic left/right : -3.63 social libertarian/authoritarian : -4.0, 
  some years ago estonians had to serve in soviet military . 
  they also got some people who said they did n't want pork . 
  in two months they were eating everything that was given to them . 
  i guess these refugees are not suffering yet . 
  i think even estonians are not welcome in v\u00f5ru or other small places in estonia . 
  at least going to a local bar is like asking for a fight . 
  that being said tallinn is very racist as well . 
  i have had problems going out to the old town with couchsurfers . 
  i 'd rather not say what i have been told . 
  irl and estonian center party said in their statement that this could be attempted murder . 
  vabaerakond talked about why this could have happened but did n't say much about this at all . 
  ekre supports the arsonists . 
  others condemned these cowardly actions . 
  i 'm pretty sure this/these people will be caught and trying to burn down a house where people live in would need a quite hard punishment . 
  i have read news about germans burning down refugee centers . 
  lets throw germany out of eu for that . 
  very positively . 
  the only western ally that seems to understand our situation . 
  when i play online with americans they often asked sort of worriedly how they are viewed in my country because they seem to think that all of europe hates them . 
  food costs pretty much the same . 
  western-europe has same products with better ingredients . 
  clothes are cheaper in germany . 
  street food like kebab has the same price but you can find better kebab in germany . 
  so at least in estonia it is not much cheaper . 
  just less money to spend . 
  sweden joining nato would help defend baltics a lot . 
  they own quite a big portion of baltic countries and it would be good for them to keep the money flowing . 
  i do n't really know what we are not agreeing with . 
  estonia has agreed with pretty much everything eu or nato has asked us to do . 
  i wonder what would estonia have to do . 
  bring them to estonia in handcuffs and keep them in guarded prison camps so they ca n't run to germany or sweden ? 
  seems to be easier than coming to estonia . 
   and the baltic states were hit hard by the financial crisis , but recovered pretty thousands of estonians just moved to finland . 
  estonia was unwilling to use loans to soften the blow instead profitable state companies were sold and we kept good finances and got the euro for that . 
  now we are forced to take loans anyway to pay for greece . 
  yes . 
  throw out the baltics because you read one internet comment that did n't match your opinion . 
  we share a lot of things . 
  yet living in tallinn it is very hard to see much everyday connection with lithuania . 
  we have much more business and work relations with finland . 
  i think latvia is close to us but in trouble with corruption . 
  so i do n't see us leaving latvia but with lithuania there is not much visible connection . 
  western capital has made a killing in the ee . 
  still more than ee that must pay your debts . 
  i think people living in poland did not use their refugee rights and are not in debt in that regard . 
  these are the people who stayed . 
  i think it all depends on what school they went to . 
  when they went to an estonian school they are usually well integrated . 
  russian schools on the other hand produce russians that are still quite like their immigrant parents . 
  average salary here is more than 1k . 
  latvia is somewhere around 700 so there is a noticable difference . 
  we are losing some cheap manufacturing to cheaper lithuania . 
  more latvians should move here . 
   universal employment too bad for a lot of estonians this meant forced labor/prison camps in siberia . 
  i agree with the sense of community that i remember from my childhood . 
  but i also remember how we did n't have meat products to eat . 
  90s with foreign products and tv was the most amazing change and it was worth it . 
  all of my class is doing much better than people in the soviet union . 
  i understand that for many russians things did not improve and they lost the security and community they had and gained nothing . 
  you ca n't fix the whole world . 
  not everyone can be rich and not everyone can have food and clean water . 
  i doubt lidl forces people to make jeans at gunpoint or that lidl established minimum salary limits in some countries . 
  germans are like this as well . 
  i sometimes do some stupid jokes that how could you say that or that was a wrong thing to say and they become very worried and sorry . 
  it 's funny to me . 
  we have more land than denmark . 
  fun fact . 
  finland has a deficit similar in size to estonia 's entire budget . 
  and lets never have different currencies as well . 
  they all had russian names . 
  too bad we will never see that day . 
  for some reason you guys feel super threatened by smaller countries . 
   sure it is way easier to bribe a policeman in eastern europe i dare you try that in estonia . 
  only people who still do it are latvian tourist who do n't know they ca n't . 
  the main issue is how slovakia calls their country : slovensk\u00e1 republika . 
  russia ca n't move 100 % of it 's forces to attack poland . 
  poland on the other hand would mobilize everything to defend . 
  you can see tallinn from the last picture . 
  too close for comfort . 
  i have been advised to buy barilla and de cecco . 
  one italian living in estonia said that a lot of pizza and pasta we have he would not dare call pizza and pasta . 
  as a kid my mother made me pasta with ketchup and some ground meat quite often .

  does it mean you think the us intervenes too much , or too little , or in a wrong place ... it makes huge difference , but ca n't be deducted from this data . 
  all that this says is : do you think the us leadership is just right , in just the right place , all perfect . 
  yes , this is a real issue . 
  not one that affects our everyday life , but it 's definitely something estonians really yearn for . 
  to be recognised as wealthy and nice nordics , instead of poor and backwards eastern europe . 
  well , the ratio went off during wwii and never really came back . 
  but yes , it 's due to much lower life expectancy of men ( women live 11 years longer ) and it 's due to alcoholism , smoking , bad eating habits , over-working , stuff like that . 
   according to a survey by the pew research center in 2012 , found that 75 % of europeans considered themselves christians . 
  [ 2 ] from wikipedia . 
  just . . read your own previous post and think about what you just said . 
  some coherence and consistency would be welcome . 
  yeah , no . 
  in this case the majority of europeans are radicals for believing in an absolutist truth . 
  that is ... old news ? 
  i mean they already postponed the ban like what , three years ? 
  oh my , i remember the negative growth speak in the 2008-2009 period . 
  i 'm not 100 % sure , but as my father explained to me , after the unification of germany , berlin was thought to become a new metropolis and extensive residential developments were made . 
  however it turned out people did n't flock to berlin , so there was considerable oversupply of housing , making it very cheap . 
  for some reason foodstuff is n't that expensive there either , do n't know why that is . 
  maybe relative closeness to the cheaper eastern europe ? 
  funny how all the self proclaimed progressives and liberals love the state and its power . 
  you all hate the isds until your own small mom and pap store gets its ass handed to it by government in some random situation . 
  i do n't know . 
  if it does n't hurt anybody then why care ? 
  if i pollute my room by not cleaning it for a while it 's no-ones business as long as it does n't affect others . 
  however if the filth means there 's going to be rats and cockroaches that encroach on other people 's land it becomes their business . 
  how do we solve pollution that does n't affect people , but other animals or that does only have an indirect and hard to detect effects ? 
  we can make laws , contracts , social agreements , promote ethics and morality etc. 
  in capitalism ( where property rights exist at least ) the owner of the land being polluted can sue for compensation . 
  peasant education became a big thing under the swedes . 
  but yes , the good swedish times is more of a newer era thing , than it was back then . 
  germany ( both west and east ) spent a lot of money on military during the cold war and it was n't really that big of a problem , since everyone understood germany was the first in line to be the future battlefield . 
  i do n't think a modern germany has more problems with spending on military than that of the germany right after hitler . 
  poland ? 
  poland existed from about 10th century . 
  they were eventually annexed and later reborn , but there 's little reason to consider them young then the usa . 
   no need for commie blocks in every town on a planet . 
  not arguing for that . 
  commie blocks can and are being turned into modern buildings that look good to the eye and offer more comfort than they used to . 
  in the end , beauty is in the eyes of the beholder , so we can easily accept to disagree . 
  maybe . 
  i do n't have a problem with unoriginal buildings , but i do have a problem with buildings that pretend to be what they are n't . 
  i do n't think you can build a modern building that tries to look identical to that of one from the 19th century . 
  because it 's not . 
  i really like old buildings ... because they are old . 
  you can certaily adopt certain features of old buildings into new ones , but simple copying is like making a plastic version of an old artifact , it is n't and will never be as good as the original, 
  it 's so fake it hurts . 
   the eu should be funded exclusively by a eu-wide 10 % corporation tax no thanks . 
  finally !, 
  the recognition we 've been longing for . 
  our happiness is by a huge amount produced by our decent gdp . 
  however if we were to fall behind other countries too much , happiness will start to suffer . 
  it 's hard to be happy if your living standards start to go down . 
  skyscrapers ( or high-rise buildings ) can definitely make a city a better place . 
  not only due to their efficient use of space , that is highly lacking in many cities , but they can be landmarks to navigate to ( like in the direct vicinity from an important road in a city ) as well as add prestige to the city ( which actually matters in an economic sense ) . 
  they have to be placed right though , best in small clusters and not in the middle of low-rise buildings . 
  oh lol , politico has a stroooong ( american ) liberal bias . 
  but you took our bloody flag !, 
  they were governed by an authoritarian regime for a long time and spent a long time and resources trying to maintain their empire . 
  norway is 692 percent ? 
  would work in estonian , `` loeb '' means both as counting a vote and as a vote that counts ( is important ) . 
  as opposed to the ingenious ideas in this thread like `` why do n't you just shut it down and import everything '' a more realistic solution that does n't involve fucking our economy up , is investing into technologies and capabilities to further improve the products of oil shale industry . 
  everyone in this industry in estonia knows that burning oil shale for electricity is the worst thing you could do with it . 
  it is extremely wasteful , polluting and creates little value . 
  the way forward would be to turn the oil shale into oil , gas and chemicals that can be used for energy , chemical industry and construction , which would leave behind much less waste and create much more value . 
  this however takes investments , technological advancements and high oil prices to happen . 
  the time under swedish rule in estonian national folklore ( ? ), 
  is often called `` the good swedish times '' . 
  mostly because it was that time when our serfs gained a lot more rights ( although not given full freedom as swedish peasants , but many would argue that had the swedish rule lasted longer , then this might have also been a case ) . 
  during that time peasants started receiving primary education ( which had a lot to do with swedish protestantism ) . 
  also our oldest university university of tartu was established by swedes in 1632 , as well as our oldest still functioning gymnasium ( gustav adolph 's gymnasium in tallinn ) . 
  this guy https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bengt_gottfried_forselius is still taught in estonian history . 
  also a joke , that during regaining independence estonian parliament wanted to declare war on sweden and then immediately surrender , to become part of sweden . 
  but you 're now too homosex in sweden , so we ca n't have that anymore . 
  it 's not irrelevant as the only realistic alternative to our dependancy on oil shale is imports . 
  although i 'm personally hoping for a nuclear solution eventually . 
  why only dag\u00f6 though ? 
  would n't you want us all ? 
  oil shale * the extraction methods , recycling and deposition of waste has become a lot better with investments ( a lot from the eu ) , also the overall amount consumed has gone down by about half since the end of ussr , due to not having to supply leningrad . 
  but in the end , burning the fuel is going to create co2 no matter what . 
  speaking of alternatives : nuclear power - there was a willingness to join in with your nuclear power plant , but since your people voted no , it got dropped . 
  there have been talks about possible estonian nuclear power plant , but given the complete lack of competence , know-how and skilled workers in the sector , it would be a hard challenge . 
  wind power is used extensively ( much more so than in lv , lt or fi ) and there are mutliple huge projects in different parts of the pipeline , but in the end , wind can not support our entire energy needs . 
  importing energy like lv and lt is a good solution on paper , but does it actually solve anything ? 
  importing electricity . 
  to be fair lithuania was doing very well when ignalina was still working and in latvia daugava really is a pretty big river . 
  during and after world war 2 , ussr annexed eastern finland , the baltic states , kaliningrad ( old k\u00f6nigsberg ) , moldova ( bessarabia ) and eastern poland into itself . 
  it however also created a sphere of influence of semioccupied and puppeted nations called the warsaw pact which also included poland , czechoslovakkia , hungary , romania and bulgaria , which all had different levels of soverignity or say autonomy . 
  romania under ceau\u0219escu for example displayed occasional disloyalty to ussr . 
  aside from these puppet states there were other friendly and ussr-alligned socialist nations around the world ( like cuba in the americas ) . 
  there were also non-alligned socialist powers like yugoslavia or albania , that had quite cold relations with the ussr . 
  there was also china who i 'd say was a rival socialist power to the ussr . 
  there was a smallish hippy movement and a fairly big punkish movement in estonia , ca n't really talk about others . 
  of the three coalition parties , the centre party ( the one you 're asking about ) and the social democrats have long said they want the tax rate to be more progressive ( i.e not flat ) and the third party ( irl or union of pro patria and res publica ) although nominally a staunch supporter of flat tax , actually proposed a similar if not the exact same plan during the last parliamentary elections . 
  i 'd just say it 's somewhat wrong to say that we are ditching flat tax , we always had two brackets : the tax free bracket and taxed bracket . 
  what changes is that the tax free amount increases and is changed to a linear model up to some level . 
  basically it was a tax reduction for the low earners as opposed to a tax increase for the wealthy . 
  it 's been in the centre 's agenda for a looong time . 
  this is just the first time that the parties supporting this change are actually in charge of the government . 
  traditionally pro-russia ...

  wow . 
  amazing . 
  such discovery . 
  so how are the evil easterners again not allowing you to trade with russia ? 
  if they reach 3 % , it would be fastest since 2001 . 
  and it 's possible they will reach such numbers next quarter . 
   fundamentally we have a common market but not a common legislation , which is a recipe for disaster , even if it might currently benefit your side . 
  we have a rather strong trade deficit with germany , but do n't let facts get in the way of you . 
   sure they do and when german jobs move abroad , to say eastern europe , it will be no skin of their nose either . 
  you have 2nd lowest unemployment rate in eu and you whine about german jobs moving abroad ? 
  what ? 
   better idea we jettisone the dead-weight in the east , re-establish trade barriers with you , trade with russia again and take the free money and decreased economic pressure to improve our own living standards . 
  so am i going too far by estimating you have some russian heritage ? 
  because there 's no way a normal german would have so much hate for cee and love for russia for no clear reason , as well as pushing absolutely contradictory statements on how germany somehow `` loses '' from current eu . 
   then it 's time we address if this pillar is in the interest of a great many citiziens of the eu , namely the ones in the west . 
  or youcan wait until the anti-eu parties are doing it for you . 
  if europeans are annoyed by educated workers of similar culture coming to work in their countries , they 're xenophobic morons and there 's no point for eu with such people anyway . 
  but as it is now , germany is taking even millions of non-eu people of foreign culture and the government is more popular than ever . 
  this `` euro causes prices to rise '' is the most bullshit argument , yet it seems to be rather common . 
  prices did rise fast in 2011 , when estonia adopted the euro , but when one looks at world food and commodity prices , as well as fast economic growth of that time , it would have happened with any currency . 
  meanwhile , we had actually negative inflation from 2014 -- 2016 . 
  then , even if the euro causes inflation to go up by like 0.2 % , it 's irrelevant . 
  to a certain level , inflation is actually necessary for the economy . 
  european central bank has been trying to raise inflation consistently for the past years . 
  i understand the problem of no exchange rate fluctuation compared to your trade partners , which should reflect the economic situation , but the `` euro makes prices high '' is complete bullshit . 
  do you mean those `` wacky eastern europeans '' that work in wealthier western european countries ? 
  it 's their right granted by the freedom of movement , which is one of the pillars of eu . 
  it 's stupid to see how many are comparing it to non-eu ( illegal ) immigrants . 
  if for example , germany does n't see a difference , it 's their own problem . 
  europeans have given free movement only to selected countries , not all people in the world . 
  lol , you 're from germany and whine how bad you have it ? 
  have n't you noticed how your economy has been probably one of the biggest beneficiaries of eu , surrounded by a giant free export market ? 
  in economic output per capita , germany has clearly taken over finland , japan , uk and france . 
  the fact that your government has opted for export cometitiveness before rising wages is purely your own country 's choice . 
  besides , a lot of eu members are actually asking you to rise wages , so germany would have bigger domestic demand . 
   her previously working with the \u00d6ine vahtkond what ? 
  i have n't heard of that . 
   her obsession with the 9th may celebrations i do n't think it 's obsession . 
  i think in her mind , she tries to unite estonians and russians . 
  and she thinks going to the `` russian commemoration '' , she 's taking the first step . 
  she just forgets that it 's not estonians unwilling to accept russian celebrations . 
  the fact that those celebrations are very much connected with occupation of estonia is the problem . 
  we do n't see much room to make compromises here , soviet union is enemy of republic of estonia and end of story . 
  you ca n't fly blue-black-white and red hammer and sickle at the same time . 
  and it 's something russians should respect . 
  well , at least that 's how it works in my mind . 
   the whole party is just still going with the same pro-russian battleplan . 
  i think they 're strongly split actually , but they do n't want to break the party apart . 
  keskerakond has enjoyed stable high support for years . 
  scandals , crimes etc , their support never drops below a certain level . 
  it 's benefiting both sides , by the way , as pro-russians would never be most popular party in estonia . 
  but the cracks are very visible . 
  i , for example , would be willing to vote for them only if they split . 
  i wo n't give a vote for them if i ca n't be sure it does n't go to some putinist . 
   time and time again they 've pushed out the non-kneebenders out of the levers of power together with the same pro-kremlin bunch . 
  i think that was during savisaar reign . 
  with ratas-simson-reps , things have changed . 
  it 's yana toom that has had some warnings this time . 
  she 's quite different from savisaar , though . 
  unlike savisaar , she 's rather straightforward about her views . 
  she does n't even pretend to be likeable to estonians . 
  i mean , she hinted about bronze night that estonians were `` exploiting the event '' and they should accept the violence , looting and stealing as normal part of protests because `` it 's normal in paris , stockholm or london '' . 
  ( which it is n't and even if it was , there 's no way i 'd want to make it normal here ) . 
  to me , she 's a pro-putin bitch full of herself . 
  and if she 's supposed to be representative of russians in estonia , i have to say she sure has managed to leave a disgusting impression . 
  she 's like the leader of anti-integration . 
  you 're talking about the belgrade waterfront project , i assume ? 
  according to [ this ] ( http://www.b92.net/eng/news/business.php?yyyy=2015&amp;mm=10&amp;dd=19&amp;nav_id=95764 ) , the prices of apartments would be around 5 ' 000 $ / sqm . 
  i do n't know about belgrade real estate prices , but new apartments by tallinn seaside , next to old town ( probably the most prestigious area in the city ) are 3 ' 000 $ / sqm , so it really seems strongly overpriced , if correct . 
  who would you name as such ? 
  i do n't think there are others quite like him at this point . 
  maybe i just see free speech as something wider than you do . 
  imo , it definitely includes the impartiality of the public broadcaster . 
  tvp is financed from the budget , so it 's in an unequal position compared to private channels by nature . 
  it 's definitely not in compliance with free speech to exploit that in the benefit of the government party . 
  well , okay , we 're clear here then . 
  it 's just i have a rather different experience of public broadcasters from this region . 
  for example , nordic countries have tv-tax to make their public broadcasters independent . 
  the state ca n't change their funding , so they have no ( direct ) leverage over them . 
  in estonia , the members of council of the public broadcaster are named by each parliament fraction . 
  the funding is still from budget , but that still needs approval of parliament , so again , government ca n't take any unilateral moves . 
  probably , i mean considering what countries some of the people come from , there 's probably not much more to find out . 
  your argument is basically that everything is biased to some extent , so does n't matter if it 's wiadomosci-style or finnish yleisradio style , you will have to follow other news anyway . 
  then , what 's the point of public broadcaster ? 
  why should taxpayers fund government propaganda ? 
  let them only have private media and everything would work the same way as you wrote , with more money saved in the budget . 
   anyhow , the news tend to follow the biases of the owners of a news outlet , and it 's healthy to keep that in mind while consuming them . 
  the people that write the news are not somehow brain-controlled by the owners , though . 
  if there 's a proper free speech and culture of unbiased reporting , i can trust that the reporter tries to be fair and writes stuff correctly . 
  of course , if there are some issues with the company itself , they most likely wo n't cover them or cover them biasedly . 
   there 's no such thing as `` unbiased news '' . 
  not 100 % , of course . 
  there 's always the human factor . 
  but it 's quite a big difference from a political party mouthpiece . 
   but you need to diversify your news sources to get anything resembling an accurate picture . 
  you ca n't rely only on a one source , expecting that they will always spoon-feed you high quality , unbiased and truthful news - doing that is the best recipe to achieving the exact opposite outcome . 
  of course i diversify my news sources , i do n't watch tv news only . 
  but what i meant is who would be going swapping channels and then trying to put something together from propaganda pieces ? 
  if that 's how it works , i just would n't watch them at all . 
  oh , makes sense then .

   genetically , historically and linguistically non-european countries lol . 
  try harder . 
  what ? 
  your caps lock is glitching ? 
  try harder, 
  turkey is europe but finland is not europe ? 
  that 's some turkish logic . 
   almost all independent experts on hacking and encryption say that electronic voting is a bad idea . 
  except [ this reality-show-style '' '' `` research '' '' '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iit5wdlywns ) , are there any real experts that say that ? 
   and it loses anonymity . 
  so that `` not-anonymous '' way it can be really checked that your vote was counted for the candidate you voted for and it was not rigged , which is impossible with a paper ballot . 
  but can you stay in queue online ? 
  electronic vote ca n't be faked because it is digitally signed with strong encryption . 
  can a paper ballot be faked ? 
  very easily , you would just need a printer and a pen for that . 
  i was on vabaduse v\u00e4ljak ( tallinn city centre ) and saw juncker and tusk on the scene . 
  it 's nice that they came . 
  please check this link with the table of requirements https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/accession_of_serbia_to_the_european_union#negotiation_progress . 
  in order to become a member , serbia should fulfil all of them . 
  the world is not spinning around kosovo . 
  you are talking like it is the only issue . 
  no , it is a private company . 
   maybe it comes down to the fact that europe is , in fact , multiple countries ? 
  with different laws and taxes ? 
  uh , no . 
  remember the word called `` single market '' ? 
  that is being promoted from every corner ? 
  i believe it has something to do with `` laws and taxes '' . 
   if people in estonia want to pay the same amount of money for goods as in western europe - by all means , be our guests . 
  just expect to pay twice as much for everything . 
  yes . 
  i run a business and it is frustrating that sometimes i have to use forwarding services for shipping from amazon.de - it makes invoicing harder . 
  i do not get however the `` twice as much '' part - i did not notice it from my verified amazon.de business account . 
   meanwhile amazon.de has that exact same gpu at 482 $ . 
  the specific gpu i wanted is also available for 541 $ . 
  amazon is good but the worst thing there is that some items do not ship to estonia ( * something something single market eu stronk * ) so you have to use a third party forwarding service which may make a vat invoice harder . 
  in the digital market ( i.e. 
  like google ) ? 
  yes , absolutely . 
  eu things like `` cookie law '' is utter nonsense . 
  that 's why we do not have a `` european amazon '' . 
  argument is that google is a private company and they are free to promote their own services using their own services . 
  it does not exist . 
  thanks to the regulations aka the big government . 
  you mean government handouts ? 
  probably we ca n't , but we can at least shitpost about it on reddit . 
  user name checks out . 
   they should even be paying for transport fees . 
  not just transport fees , but also markup and interest rate . 
   bombing the populated area  your desire for massive disproportionate killing where did you get the `` populated area '' part ? 
  where did you get the `` killing '' part ? 
  there is nothing about this in my comment . 
  you just imagined this and built your whole argument on your baseless imagination . 
  lookup lgbt laws in estonia . 
  hint : they are good , better than in half of eu . 
   they were given 15-month suspended jail terms and ordered to pay $ 165,000 ( # 145,000 ; $ 185,000 ) each , with half the sum suspended . 
  should have get a life sentence and a few air strikes into their [ barbaric ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lgbt_rights_in_the_united_arab_emirates ) land called uae . 
  or a feature , depends on how you look at it . 
  if they would be real refugees why would they block the road ? 
  is it worse in calais than in syria ? 
  nah , they just want more welfare benefits . 
   the emperor would return gifts worth at least the same amount or more instant roi . 
  bad that they abandoned this practice . 
  well legally we never were a part of ussr . 
  nothing ( or very little ) prevented ukraine or georgia in 1991 from doing the same . 
  it was their choice to declare themselves as successors of ukrainian / georgian ssr - i do not understand what was the point of such action . 
   this is also why all former ussr countries ( even georgia ! ), 
  have special process for applying for turist visa to japan :( not true . 
  [ estonian citizens may visit japan without a visa for up to 90 days ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/visa_requirements_for_estonian_citizens ) . 
   not so sure on that . 
  we 're dealing with the military here . 
  you can not rely on natural obstacles when dealing with navy divers and spetsnaz . 
  they only need 3-4 of them as agent provocateur . 
  well there is border patrol with `` sensors , cameras , radars and uav-s '' for that . 
   btw . 
  do you happen to know what troop-types the bundeswehr actually sent exactly ? 
  would be nice to know what kind of threat they actually expect . 
   yes , but i think there should be even more of everything . 
  in this case , if the border is protected with a person every 50meter ( figuratively - that 's the number i remember from the cold war border controls ) , 100 % coverage with person-radar , drone surveillance and all the modern stuff , we 'd be doing it right . 
  majority of the border with russia is either [ a river or a lake ] ( https://www.google.ee/maps/@58.5801187,27.3242701,8.07z ) so it makes illegal crossing harder and surveillance easier . 
  1 person every 50 meters would definitely help but i think current threat is not that high to do that . 
  however , here is what [ estonia 's border guard website says ] ( https://www.politsei.ee/en/uudised/uudis.dot?id=471075 ) :  estonia is establishing border surveillance system using modern , beyond the state-of-art technology to enhance border security at the external border of the european union . 
  estonia will completely cover it ` s 136 km of land border with sensors , cameras , radars and uav-s developing thus innovative border protection system . 
  seems to be a pretty solid setup . 
  it does not matter whether they are `` rebels '' , russian troops or anyone else . 
  any threat invokes article 5 and is being eliminated . 
  it does not matter whether russia denies it or not . 
  in order to invoke article 5 or eu article 42.7 we do not need to ask for anyone permission - we can do it literally right now . 
  also , besides that there are right now some other nato troops in the baltic states , which makes russian involvement even more impossible . 
  take a look at [ that photo from narva ] ( https://pbs.twimg.com/media/c4wjirywiaescf7.jpg ) . 
  the castle in background is russia . 
   very , very well guarded borders , including a strong anti-smuggling force to prevent weapons from being sneaked into the country . 
  [ we are already building the wall ] ( http://www.dw.com/en/estonia-vows-to-wall-off-russia/a-18678344 ) . 
   we should be ready to help out quickly with a few police - `` hundertschaften '' and maybe even gsg9 . 
  we also have our own gsg9-like thing called estsof [ ( their ad video ) ] ( https://youtu.be/fenyrgf0ono ) , so we also would be able to do something until the help arrives . 
   supplied with facial recognition software to sort out any non-citizen of eu for intensive search and to collect biometric data it 's likely impossible to implement such software . 
  at the very least it would require high resolution photos of every eu citizen , and besides that there are legit non-eu tourists . 
   just like in ukrainian donbas it ca n't be `` just like in ukrainian donbass '' . 
  russia may deny it as much as it want , but if article 5 is invoked all their troops inside a nato country will be eliminated , whether do they like it or not . 
  really a good idea .

  how about those statistics though ? 
   i could spend a day doing that . 
  here 's my first link , a report from someone who has a first hand experience : anecdotal evidence from a single refugee , i 'd like to see those statistics that prove everything i said was incorrect . 
   the reality is that this is a silly hyperbole of yours . 
  how is this a hyperbole ? 
  there are hundreds of millions of people in africa and middle-east willing to move to europe in a heartbeat . 
   none of what you said is true . 
  every news source and statistic says otherwise . 
  do share then . 
   there is an alternative . 
  it 's to accept them in europe instead of sending them into isis 's hands . 
  this is the solution that guarantees that they will not be hurt or killed or enslaved . 
  we should n't forget that they are human beings just like us , and they need help . 
  the reality is that we ca n't accept the entire african population into europe . 
   majority of them are . 
  majority of them are n't , or you would n't have so many people who have `` lost '' their documents and they would n't all be young well-fed men with nice clothes and the money to pay smugglers several thousand euros . 
  majority of them are economic migrants . 
   the boats did n't stop coming when marenostrum ended . 
  desperate people will continue to take try to cross . 
  yes , because we did n't send the boats back , they just stopped actively helping them for a while . 
   that 's actually a terrible solution considering the place these people are running away from . 
  safety of human beings is a moral priority for europeans and these refugees will be safer here than in libya or syria . 
  there is no alternative . 
  a lot of them are n't refugees . 
  estonian 3 number , 3 letter plates are obviously superior . 
  and it will only increase , once people back home hear of their success crossing the mediterranean , because of our open borders policy . 
  at some point the number of vessels will overwhelm the rescue boats and a bunch of people will drown again , which will make eu send more ships there , which will result in even more people trying to cross and overwhelming the rescue boats again and people drowning again and eu sending more boats * ad infinitum * . 
  there is really only one solution here and it 's turning around all the boats , is it a perfect solution ? 
  but there is n't a better one . 
  you can take a train from tallinn to helsinki ? 
  what a load of bull , obviously nothing would really change for expats , as nothing would change for people who already legally immigrated to the uk . 
  not that i support uk leaving , but this is just scaremongering , but what can you really expect from vice anyway . 
  do i like it ? 
  no do i understand it to a level ? 
  yes my point was that you ca n't really guilt some countries into accepting refugees , like estonia for example . 
  although `` all '' means `` under '' in estonian . 
  if they 're genuine refugees and they know they have zero success taking a boat to europe , they will seek refuge in neighboring countries instead . 
  pretty much everyone is against this except some of the bigger players . 
  it 's all about power . 
  bigger players want more power , smaller players want to keep their sovereignty . 
  this is my impression as an estonian , i could be wrong , just giving my thoughts on it . 
  common sense ? 
  if something has a zero chance of success people will stop trying to do it . 
  they probably already have by a lot and sooner or later it will stop altogether , if there 's no point in trying people will stop . 
  `` madal '' in that word means low \\ ^ \\ ^ , but close enough !, 
  was n't romania in a similar position ? 
  they seem to be doing pretty well now , so there 's hope for you as well . 
  the number of people who reached australia went down and there 's no doubt the people trying the trip will drop close to zero as well eventually . 
  yeah , serbia is in a difficult position . 
  i hope you guys come around . 
  still works though . 
  we 're talking about finland , what i 'm trying to say is that finnish people do n't have a negative impression about black people because they 're black , but rather have a negative impression about somalis because they 're overrepresented in crime . 
   gib euromonies pls well you 're getting ridiculous amounts of euromonies tho . 
  which i support . 
  because it works . 
  you mean the estonians that were returned to russia by sweden and finland , to face execution or gulags ? 
  holland and madalmaad ( which is a direct translation of netherlands - lowlands ), 
   the swedish result on the question about jews certainly does n't fit the recent media narrative . 
  it does though , the problem is n't swedes being anti-semitic , it 's immigrants . 
   and what 's up with finland and black people ? 
  it 's most likely not about black people but somalis in particular , but because almost all black people in finland are somali they become one and the same in the mind of an average person . 
  the negative impression likely stems from somalis being overrepresented in crime statistics . 
  like i said in a similar thread before , i think it would be great if finland and sweden joined , because then we could establish complete control over the baltic sea . 
  no more surprise submarines . 
  if push ever came to shove , we could completely deny russia any avenue for attack in the baltic sea , which i believe is currently one of the bigger threats . 
  the amount of cars in estonia with russian number plates has increased immensely in the past few years . 
  usually expensive cars too . 
  it 's no surprise in these parts that a lot of russians are leaving . 
  loans go on hold while you 're in the military , + you earn a bit of money while you 're there , so in reality , for most people their economic situation will be better after they finish conscription . 
  yeah , poor estonians and finns , how do they manage to pull it off ? 
  oh wait , they do and they 're not crying about it . 
  why would we want our math scores to drop ? 
  kek . 
  the swedish migration board did nothing wrong , the reason that man did n't get asylum is exactly the same reason why ukrainians are n't given asylum , because most of the country is safe . 
  he did n't have to go back to chechnya , he could 've stayed in moscow or anywhere else in russia . 
  we do n't really know what the actual sexual assault rate in sweden is , since they gather their statistics differently , but probably still a lot higher than most oecd members . 
  are n't most of your foreigners germans ? 
  that barely counts ... 
  why do you think they do n't want to live together ? 
  if i were to immigrate into another country , i would like to live close to other estonians . 
   it is n't that hard to manage town/community development to ensure that the most convenient real estate is scattered , rather than concentrated in a few quarters . 
  yes , it is n't `` that hard '' , it 's impossible . 
  and all this has ever achieved when tried is white flight . 
  not to mention trying this is very problematic for a multitude of reasons . 
  the argument sounds akin to saying `` people ca n't levitate because they 're not trying hard enough '' . 
  http://www.civitas.org.uk/crime/crime_stats_oecdjan2012.pdf the country with 10th highest robberies , second highest assaults , 5th highest bulgaries , second highest car thefts out of oecd members is one of the safest countries in the world ? 
  and these are 2012 statistics , i 'm more than sure the stats are higher for 2014-2015 . 
  why does it seem that not a single country can implement immigration non-poorly ? 
  what are you supposed to do when they want to live together in one area ? 
  tell them they ca n't ? 
  you sure the cleaning ladies were estonian ? 
  unemployed man ? , vodka , axe , ca n't undestand the last one . 
  do n't worry though finlan , you can always come work in estonia : ) . 
  so why are they pushing this refugee quota system ? 
  just take them all and problem solved . 
  you do understand that us is n't the only country with a military industry ? 
  you could buy everything you need from other eu members . 
  you 're just advocating a race to the bottom , say poland says that they 're only spending 1 % , then france says `` well if poland only spends 1 % then why should we spend any more '' and that 's how it goes until there 's no real military left . 
  everybody should spend their fair share , if somebody wants to spend more , we ca n't stop them , but nobody should be forced to pick up the tab after anyone else . 
  nobody is cheering for military buildup , but the reality is that we have a neighbor who has made it clear that it has no problem invading other countries even in the 21st century and we need to be able to protect ourselves .

   local clubs and gatherings . 
  clubs are a terrible place to meet nice women imho , you should join some activities clubs that match your interests , where you can get to know other girls and they can get to know you , in a neutral setting . 
   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/interracial_marriage_in_the_united_states#census_bureau_statistics if you look at the statistics of us , which is the most diverse country in the world ? 
  ( correct me if i 'm wrong ) , you 'll see that interracial marriages are rather rare . 
  it 's just that most white girls like white men , middle-eastern girls like middle-eastern men and black girls like black men . 
  which means it 's much harder for you to date a native girl , not impossible , but just harder . 
  so you have to put in much more effort than most or find a middle-eastern girl . 
  i think they like you fine , it 's just that estonians and finns are very closely related , so we are kinda like family . 
  i know there are some people who like to use `` estland '' when speaking in english , i personally like `` estonia '' better . 
  you can share brotherly love with us \\ ^ \\ ^ . 
  if they were actual nazis , do you think 20 % of the swedish population would vote for them ? 
  they 're not even `` right '' , they 're pretty much left , but they want to cut down on immigration to sweden to sustainable levels . 
  i was under the impression that he got removed , do you have sauce ? 
  although i just realized that slyratchet probably could n't remove him as davidreiss666 was an older mod , so you 're probably right . 
  if it 's in every other comment thread , then it should be easy , no ? 
  or you 're just as full of it as op is ? 
   now it 's dae hate the browns in every other comment thread . 
  so give me some examples of this ? 
  it was a while ago , people where complaining about him a lot and slyratcher finally removed him . 
  what is there really to secure ? 
  we do n't get many illegals coming from russia and it 's not like any border defense is going to stop an invasion . 
  we 're going to get more migrants from the eu agreement thing ( ~ 180 ) than we 've had illegally come in for the past 24 years . 
  so it 's very much in our interests to help you secure your border . 
   typically 5-10 % of the population vote for them . 
  in recent years , i 'd say it 's much more than that . 
  sweden democrats are even polling at 20 % currently . 
  you should ask for more money from the rest of eu members , i 'm absolutely positive many would want to help , like estonia for example . 
  could n't agree more , the term `` populist '' has completely lost its meaning as well , basically if your party opposes immigration it 's automatically a populist party . 
  i also think that it has gotten a lot better after they removed davidreiss666 guy . 
   i know i ca n't prove the point about neo-nazis so you 're saying yourself that your initial point is unsubstantiated ? 
   but everyone here should be pretty aware that stormfront has started using this sub for recruitment . 
  what does that mean ? 
  what makes you say that ? 
   secondly , as i already tried to clear up : i am all for discussion and differing beliefs but all the `` remove kebab '' , `` dae sweden literally somalia '' and `` charlie hebdo is literal messiah for exposing da dirty moslam '' is getting really , really old . 
  i very rarely see comments like these , maybe the `` remove kebab '' a few times , but that 's a polandball joke , not actually meant as hate on anyone . 
   but i ca n't just stand by while literal neo-nazis are upvoted to the top could you provide a few examples of this ? 
   does n't fall for the far-right extremest opinions that seem to have taken their place in the daily discussion here ? 
  are they really ? 
  http://www.pewglobal.org/2014/05/12/chapter-3-most-support-limiting-immigration/ you can open pretty much any study on immigration and you 'll find that the majority of the public in europe is simply against it . 
  these are n't some far-right extremist views , but what regular people feel like . 
  finnish reads like estonian where there are random letters thrown in to every word \\ ^ \\ ^ . 
   out of fear of being called politically correct . 
  kek 'd . 
  if we keep being this based , nordic will soon want into eesti !, 
  i have this image of swedes that they fuck a lot , is this true ? 
  `` lauda katma '' = `` to set the table '' , `` kata laud ! '', 
  = `` set the table ! '', 
  i 'm not sure , you can say it in many different ways , i 'm guessing '' \u00c4ra kata '' or '' \u00c4ra kata kinni '' . 
  `` ei saa peitta '' - `` ca n't hide '' in estonian . 
  when will estonia officially become the most based european country ? 
  i think the time has come . 
  finland seems to be getting on track also , hope you guys stay based !, 
  for many politicians , some women like you getting attacked is an acceptable loss , quite literally . 
  when it is n't for the majority of the voters , then they just hide or destroy the statistics . 
  like sweden did , they literally stopped recording ethnicity on crime reports . 
  posts here are hardly indicative of anything , what matters is the crucification she got in the media . 
  i think you 'll be left waiting , its up to our individual countries to put our foot down . 
  with the reaction merkel got for simply stating the truth that europe ca n't handle relocating the entire africa and middle-east here , i 'm unsure any sensible solutions will be coming from western-europe . 
  as long as they are n't climbing into politicians cars , it 's hard to see when action will be taken . 
  screw the people who have to or like to take the train to commute , right ? 
  just was n't excepting the nuts defending circumcision to be on / r/europe . 
  people do circumcision in europe ? 
  we 're working on it . 
  less than third actually . 
   http://www.tradingeconomics.com/latvia/gdp the gdp was * very * inflated , going from 15 billion to 36 billion in 3 years is n't natural growth . 
   because it did n't want to derail its euro entry out of fear of russia what ? 
  how are these two things connected ? 
  also the article seems pretty dumb , the 2007 level of gdp was very inflated , built on credit , it 's not the `` true gdp '' . 
  more so than most other countries , it becomes very clear if you look back a few more years before 2007 . 
  so yes , latvia is an austerity success story , they survived the crash and are experiencing good growth again . 
  the fact that they have n't reached the gdp that was built on air and credit anyway meaning they 've failed is ridiculous . 
  it 's like saying the guy who used to earn 5000 dollars , but borrowed 3000 dollars more from the bank and spent 8000 dollars a month , but had trouble paying it back and had to cut his spending is now doing bad , since he 's only earning 6000 dollars and spending 6000 dollars . 
  that money was n't really there to begin with . 
  what ? 
  i live in tartu and there are definitely more people going to mcdonalds than hesburger . 
  by all means . . 
  we 're 187th country in the world by population density . 
  we have a shit ton of land considering our small population . 
  which is nice . 
  probably doing some research at the port . 
  you count the alcohol on few days of the year and then take the average or something . 
  i 'm not sure though . 
  oh , you mean like how estonian language is from the same language group as finland and has nothing in common with any other eastern-european languages ? 
  when our media talks about this , they always specifically say that they 're not accounting for the finns buying alcohol here . 
  one step at a time , bruv . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/northern_europe have you been living under a rock ? 
   why not remove the official gender status completely ? 
  make everybody a person , problem solved . 
  ask people for their gender if you need it for statistics or something . 
  i never understood why the government needs a record of the type of your genitals . 
  this is your brain on tumblr . 
  okay , how do you think she should have said it ? 
  have you ever thought about becoming an atheist ? 
  if so , what would you say is holding you back ? 
  makes is a strong word here . 
  what was she supposed to do ? 
  lie to her ? 
  aww yiss , estonia northern-europe . 
  [ triggered ] ( https://blueollie.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/triggered.jpg?w=320&amp;h=371 ), 
   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_alcohol_consumption_per_capita ah you think alcohol is your ally ?

  according to the 2011 census , in age group 15-29 , 81 % spoke english , ( urban 80 % and rural 83 % ) . 
  among ethnic estonians the share was 88 % ( urban 90 % , rural 84 % ) , and 61 % among non-estonians ( urban 62 % , rural 60 % ) . 
  the total proficiency is higher in the countryside due to non-estonians living overwhelmingly in urban areas . 
  right wing in total ? 
  that 's everything from far right to liberalism . 
  at the 2015 elections , they got a total of 58.8 % of the votes . 
  if you mean far right , then very small - about 0.2 % and even that is rather `` nationalist '' than anything more extreme . 
  our right wing populists got a total of 8.5 % though . 
  it 's pretty rare . 
  it 's mostly among younger females and even then it 's often not based on some animal-loving principle , but is rather just a personal taste or cuisine preference . 
  what if you enjoy wasting money ? 
  is wasting money then * not * wasting money ? 
  i see contradiction . 
  the nature - all the peninsulas in northern and western estonia , the [ cliff coasts of northern estonia ] ( https://www.google.ee/search?client=opera&amp;hs=1au&amp;biw=745&amp;bih=697&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=1&amp;q=eesti+pankrannik&amp;oq=eesti+pankrannik&amp;gs_l=img.3..0i30k1j0i5i30k1.7397.8010.0.8226.6.6.0.0.0.0.195.643.5j1.6.0.voicev1c%2ccfro%3d1%2cevd%3d1...0...1.1.64.img..2.4.448...0i7i30k1.cnkawofpxvi ) , the small islets and the numerous bogs deeper in the countryside . 
  they were established as such in 1938 . 
  i have no idea what was the reason - perhaps the centralization policies of the era of silence . 
  anyways , i would n't say the fact that they look the same is much respected here . 
  there are both municipal towns and towns that are part of ( or really the central part of ) a larger municipality , a parish . 
  we are treating them differently sort of like we treat regions differently - some regions form independent states , while some equally-sized regions are within a larger state . 
  we do n't merge them on governmental accord for analogous reasons - they have a right to decide that merging themselves . 
  very well put , not much to add even if i wanted to . 
  in the us with one seat electoral districts it may be important , but it 's utterly irrelevant here with multi-seat districts and proportional representation . 
  how the hell should we organize a municipal reform . 
  it 's been going on for decades now and whatever someone decides , most still seem to be against it ... 
  what about having the course in your native language , but allowing foreign lecturers teach in english ? 
  at least that 's how it was for me . 
  plus there were some courses that were in english anyway to include foreign students , who were there for a short period . 
   denmark has free university for eu/eea citizens , sweden too . 
  i 'm pretty sure you ca n't discriminate eu citizens vs. local citizens , so if the country has free university for locals , it will for eu citizens too . 
  not sure if there is such a rule exactly , but many states can effectively bypass it if you only introduce free courses in your country 's official language . 
  france is a [ semi-presidential system ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/semi-presidential_system ) , which is quite a common political term . 
  about 30 states use a similar system , whether democratic or not . 
  only in the case of where to live and raise the potential future children . 
  i do n't really want to live abroad for the most part of my life and if the other person does n't want to live here , then yes , that 's a problem . 
  otherwise , ethnically mixed children will grow up with both cultures usually and they wo n't lose anything unless you forget to properly introduce them to your culture . 
  i 've never dated a foreigner though , not even a person of another ethnicity . 
  he also asked about greetings . 
  leave smalltalk aside , this is not for us . 
  is it this time of the month already on r/askeurope ? 
  probably the three most famous ones : - [ * naksitrallid * ] ( http://www.reky.ee/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/reky_naksitrallid_a21.jpg ) ( `` three jolly fellows '' ) - [ * pokuraamat * ] ( https://www.rahvaraamat.ee/images/products/000/010/710/thumbnails/big/63387951a1cb3c3f246697d23834ef4704912c47/pokuraamat.jpg ) ( `` the book of * pokus * ) - [ * sipsik * ] ( https://www.rahvaraamat.ee/images/products/000/027/130/thumbnails/big/c7723d7403043e367c560983d7ad5245f16d20d0/sipsik.jpg ) ( `` the adventures of sipsik '' ), 
  * - `` how is/how 's it going ? '', 
  * - `` what is/what 's up ? '', 
  * - `` what are you doing ( in general ) ? '', 
  * - `` all 's good ? '', 
  answering my mobile phone : - * halloo !, 
  * ( `` hello ! '' ), 
  * ( `` yes , hello ! '' ), 
  * ( `` yes !? '' ), 
  * ( `` listening ! '' ), 
  * ( `` yes , listening ! '' ), 
  * ( `` yes , hello !, 
  * as in `` yes , good day ! '' ), 
  - only when someone important or sometimes when a stranger is calling . 
  yeah , sure . 
  i mean , at least the populated areas and the countryside . 
  the former soviet era industrial areas and the derelict towns mostly in the northeast are horrible , but for the most part it 's clean as soon as the weather allows them to clean up the streets after snow has melted . 
  i remember the 90s - it was quite horrible , especially in the cleanliness department . 
  i think it started to get better from about 1996 and things were more or less fine by 2000 . 
   well , but what constitutes a `` people '' ? 
  usually considered to be an ethnic group . 
   and why stop at ethnic groups ? 
  because that 's international law for you . 
   plenty of modern states are formed from several different ethnic groups and plenty of these ethnic groups were just subjugated to another one at one point in history . 
   say my neighborhood is 95 % colombian there is no such ethnic group . 
   what if i extend it to the whole city , but now include all latinos and some moroccans , and we make up 51 % of the population ? 
   it really is a complicated issue . 
  only as complicated as you make it be . 
  well-organized referendums have settled borders in that way before . 
  we all fear the moment the snow melts . 
  it 's gon na reveal some nasty things under it . 
  it will take weeks until it 's cleaned up . 
   some would say it is reasonable to allow the freedom to any one region to secede not really - there has to be a distinct ethnic group behind that region . 
  it is the right of peoples , not regions , after all . 
  `` but it 's not legal according to our constitution '' is a shitty argument when talking about a right originating from international law , especially that of jus cogens . 
  to a [ very small extent ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d1/religious_differences_in_estonia.png ) . 
  it is rather rare if a young ethnic estonian is religious . 
  local russians are more religious though . 
  i do n't think well of organized religion , but i have an almost equal impression of all organized religions in estonia , except perhaps the [ orthodox church under moscow patriarchate ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/estonian_orthodox_church_of_moscow_patriarchate ) , which is sort of moscow 's handyman at times . 
  yes , more or less . 
  german law is rather good , if not the best one out there . 
  and we just copied it . 
  try to look from afar whether they really are deaf or are just acting . 
  most likely tartu for estonia since it is a student town and unlike tallinn , does n't have many russians , who are generally far more conservative . 
  otherwise estonians in tallinn are pretty liberal as well . 
  well how to put this . 
  definitely not !, 
  the polish advertising industry is notoriously infamous here as well . 
  we have some polish washing powder commercials here that are dubbed into estonian , but the style remains horrible :d, 
  miners are usually russians in the northeast , so i imagine they vote for the estonian centre party , which is usually considered to be a left-wing populist pro-russian party . 
  plenty of russian-owned corner stores in estonia , but they usually do n't sell food brought in from russia , just general food available in estonia . 
  their organization is a bit russian-like though , you sort of feel that russian atmosphere , but with estonian products . 
  showing churches or interviews with religious people is fine . 
  showing religious ceremonies is fine if it 's for regional minorities like the seto people or the russian old believers . 
  anything further is sort of meh . 
  probably be mobilized , considering i 'm still in the `` hot reserve '' . 
  i 'm sorry , dear poles , but poland is just horribly boring to drive through . 
  it just takes up your entire day and there 's almost nothing to see [ while on the road ] besides tasteless adverts on roadsides . 
  latvia also kind of messes with your nerves with their road quality . 
  kudos for lithuanians though , they have the best roads in the region !, 
  that 's a really nice way to avoid insulting op for why excluded all the other countries !,

  did you even bother to read what it is about ? 
  it gives absolutely no right nor does it even make it easier to reside or even travel to estonia . 
  wow , what the fuck ? 
  if more people knew about this shady shit , a lot less people would support the schengen . 
  we opened our borders to eu citizens , not every idiot who can pay belgium 400 000 euros , what a joke . 
   the possession of legislative power does not implicate affection of an average citizens day to day life either , it 's not an inevitable consequence . 
  legislative power obviously helps , as does presence in media ( and politics ) . 
  and we are not even talking about indirect affection . 
  in real life though , some person appearing on the media does n't really affect your life , you can turn off the tv . 
  what you ca n't ignore is when the facets of your life are changing . 
  like taxes , subsidies , the 200 people arriving in your small village of 1000 people from a third world country , laws that forbid or legalize doing something etc. 
   as to afd and hate : yes , being against mass immigration is n't necessarily hate . 
  it 's a vague opinion that only consists of being against instead of for something , which makes it a rather unproductive and less valuable , but still perfectly legitimate opinion . 
  it 's a opinion build on fears and emotions instead of rationality and empirical facts . 
  it 's a simple barroom clich\u00e9 , which is nothing that is forbidden in politics - but also not very useful in politics either . 
  i do n't see what is vague about it . 
  also it 's the exact opposite , with facts and statistics you can make a far stronger argument against mass immigration than you can for mass immigration . 
  and that 's what has been happening in reality as well , with the leftist campaigns of `` open your heart '' or commercials that manipulate people 's emotions towards being accepting of refugees/immigrants . 
  i mean , you can be as hardcore of a leftie as you can , but it 's still impossible to refute that immigrants are over represented in a lot of bad things and underrepresented in a lot of good things . 
  now , you might argue that the reason why the facts are as such are due to things outside of the control of said immigrants , but the end of the day , they still are over represented in bad things and under represented in good things . 
  that was my point, 
   well , frauke petry might not have legislative power , but she very well affects day to day ( political ) life , especially public life . 
  she 's in news daily . 
  being in news does n't mean you actually affect the day to day life of average people . 
  you need to have legislative/executive power to do that . 
   i really do n't think hate helps at all , but let 's not forget that she is the head of a party that spreads hate and lives of people 's fears and anger . 
  hate against hate is not very productive , but we should n't forget that she kind of started the descending spiral of hate . 
  being against mass immigration is not `` hate '' , it 's a perfectly acceptable political position which some might not agree with , but according to most polls done around europe , most people do agree with . 
  if the child has no mental deficiencies and it 's a medically verifiable fact that he 's in excruciating pain and terminally ill , then i see nothing wrong with it . 
  they ca n't regret it later in life , since they 're terminally ill . . 
   when refugee shelters were being set on fire , commenters here described it as the logical conclusion of their anger . 
  nobody here said that it was acceptable or logical , what some said is that they understand where the frustrations come from and that the government could do better to engage the german public about their frustrations , so maybe these things would n't happen . 
  not even talking about drastic change of policy , but just to engage the public about their concerns . 
  this however is an entirely different thing , this person has no real legislative power , she does n't affect the day to day life of the german public , there 's no honest reason to be that frustrated at this person as to torch their car . 
  it 's just pure hate . 
  the precursor to euthanasia is and always has been in the western countries that have or do practice it that the patient is of sound mind , so most your criticism does n't really apply . 
  before you expect things , might you try reading the article first ? 
  `` environmental groups criticise plan that will allow hunters to shoot up to 47 of an estimated 68 wolves '' this means it will cost absolutely nothing to the norwegian taxpayers , they 're just allowing hunters to shoot them . 
  this is way less prevalent than people think , the mere fact that such doubts are held by large swathes of people means that nl government is aware and cautious about that . 
  average wage does n't reflect what the average person earns , that 's the sum of all wages divided by the number of people , it could be one person making 8329\u00a0000\u00a0000\u00a0000 euros a year and the rest 999\u00a0999\u00a0999 people making 1 euro a year . 
  ( i know china 's population is n't 1 billion exactly ) . 
  what you want to look at is median wage . 
  what does the absolute size of romania 's economy really give romania ? 
  for ridiculously big countries it can be a factor , to twist arms and arrange better trade deals , but romania is very far off that . 
  and this is coming from an estonian guy who made a very well received self-post about appreciating romania in / r/europe for all the huge steps they 've made towards transforming towards a modern free western country in the past 5-10 years especially . 
  the average person in china is way way poorer than the average person in romania . 
  these absolute values are pretty pointless today , what matters are the per capita values . 
  come on , that 's obviously not the poorest neighborhood in 2016 , there are a billion places that look like the 2009 picture all over bucharest today , as there are in most european capitals . 
   banning symbols does not stop the ideology behind it , you need to attack the ideology itself through education and interaction . 
  turkey probably had less people wearing hijab before ban than after it . 
  how about nazism ? 
  seemed to work pretty great there ... 
  [ sure you would .

  where did you read they were harassing anyone ? 
  are you just making things up ? 
   it is not allowed to take pictures of people without their authorization . 
  no , it 's not illegal to take pictures of people without their authorization in public places . 
  at least not in france and i 'm pretty sure nowhere else in europe . 
  i see the ultra-mega-hyper-populist-extreme-far-right meme is still alive and well . 
  `` we 're angry at the government , better destroy some poor guys property '' good luck france , honestly , you 're gon na need it . 
   then the uk should increase the minimum wage . 
  why did nobody think of this before / s , are you actually serious ? 
  to have any effect , you 'd have to set minimum wages by sector and there 's still a ton of ways to abuse it to no end . 
   in construction there is a huge issue of eastern europeans working cash in hand for wages english labourers can compete even less with . 
  it 's very hard to prove and you 'll never catch everyone doing this . 
  they usually legally pay minimum wage and then pay the rest as cash in hand with no taxes . 
  good luck trying to find every such employer and prove that they 're guilty . 
   isnt the minimum wage the same for everyone ? 
  do you want to live on minimum wage ? 
  that 's the point , they drive the wage down from 2-3x the minimum wage to minimum wage , at which money you 're unable to support your family , pay rent and live a decent life ethnic english people are used to . 
  for polish , romanian etc migrants , they live in crammed up in small apartments , send all the money home and then go back . 
  this benefits the migrants and the business owners , but the average englishman who does n't have any special skills is left high and dry . 
   are not the conditions the same for everyone ? 
  let 's make up a totally random example . 
  say i 'm an employee at a paving company , i make stuff like [ this ] ( http://completelandscape.com.au/images/bg-paving.jpg ) for a living . 
  i used to get nice new expensive gloves everyday that do n't fuck up my hands . 
  there used to be a forklift at every location we worked at ( and i could name 100x things more ) , all of this obviously costs money for the employer , but me and my mates would not be willing to work any other way . 
  now polish migrants come in , and they 're content with getting cheap gloves every 5-10 work days , their hands are all blistered to shit and their back is fucked , since the employer sold the forklifts and the polish workers have to lift the pavement stones all the way from where the truck set them down . 
  it 's impossible to regulate every single such thing , so whatever yo do , if poor migrants come , who are willing to work in shittier conditions , shittier conditions will happen . 
  and this is just a part example how the employer can take advantage of the situation and screw over his employees and there 's no recourse , since if you complain they 'll just hire another migrant , and this goes for pretty much every low skilled job , i just made this example , since i used to work as a paver myself a long time ago . 
  now i 'm a software developer and migrants barely threaten my job security at all , but i understand that not everyone can have a high skilled job and not everyone is capable of it , but those people matter as well . 
  it 's not that they 're better , it 's that they 're willing to work for much less money and shittier conditions . 
  the difference being that those are things that i can control , getting shot , blown up or run over by a extremist lunatic are n't . 
  what it showed was there were points in history where some ee countries were richer than some we countries . 
  basically the entire paragraph he wrote is bullshit , since what he wrote also applies to finland , but finland is rich as shit .

  a group that ruled us for decades and tried to russify us . 
  a group that possessed the living space of our ancestors , like literally their property which was confiscated from them . 
  i 'm sure your views about 30-40 % often nazi-minded germans living in france would be similar if you had been under a nazi occupation for five decades . 
   what i mean is that the policy is aimed to make the region more ethnically homogenous and has been successful in doing so . 
  not giving automatic citizenship has no effect on ethnic makeup . 
   when ussr dissolved , the revived latvian state refused citizenship to the russians who came the previous 50 years , thus rendering them stateless . 
  no , the act to leave them stateless came from russia - they were soviet citizens and they now the ussr did n't exist anymore . 
  russia specifically did n't give citizenship to russians living here , unlike to those who lived in other countries like finland . 
  latvia restored its pre-1940 state . 
  automatic citizenship was granted to those , who were citizens in 1940 and to their descendants . 
   how could you possibly warp that into something `` acceptable '' ? 
  how could you criticize an entire nation before checking if they have valid reasons for their almost universal understandings . 
   `` extremist '' is n't unwarranted . 
  ( the way you so very easily dismissed citizenship as a right is the by far the most obvious sign . ), 
  citizenship is a right , but it 's not an automatic right . 
  otherwise all countries having some form of citizenship tests would be breaking it . 
  citizenship is n't something you should be able to change that easily . 
   you do n't even realize that you are a decadent extremist , do you ? 
  and you do n't understand that nearly everyone in our countries think like that . 
  we have our valid reasons for that and it does n't make us extremists . 
   the only way that makes sense is if you are a right wing extremism you only make yourself look like a fool if you make comments like these before educating yourself more on the issue . 
   fact is that at the end of the soviet union there where nearly a million people who had made latvia their home or where born there , without breaking laws - domestic or international . 
  here you are wrong . 
  russian immigration was a crime according to international law . 
  ( people ca n't break international law though , they break national law , which has made international law part of their law . ), 
   yes , ignoring reality , that the people living on latvian land are individuals such a decision in 1991 would have meant there economic development and geopolitical mentality of latvia would be vastly different today . 
  the russians were soviet-installed illegal fifth column . 
  they deserved no such rights automatically . 
   ignoring 50 years of history . 
  nobody is ignoring that there was a soviet occupation . 
   how on earth can it be considered acceptable to make 1 million people stateless in the 1990s russia made them stateless , not latvia/estonia . 
  they were soviet citizens and russia , unlike estonia/latvia , is the legal successor of the soviet union . 
   how can the institution of statelessnes be defended on r/europe ? 
  perhaps educate yourself more on this complicated issue before you start to banter . 
   statelessnes , rather then adjusting to reality , can only be defended in the context of right wing extremism . 
  yeah , apparently most of us , even highly educated people , are right-wing extremists ...  where are the sane latvians ? 
  offering them automatic citizenship is sort of seen as an insane and treacherous thing to propose . 
  why would you give someone citizenship without that person even applying for one ? 
  yeah different countries have different prices for most services due to different economic development . 
  love the word , hate the fact that it is n't either translated or just generalized as `` prime minister '' in english . 
  or just * muumid * . 
  everything of [ lotte ] ( https://et.wikipedia.org/wiki/lotte ) . 
  there have been several films of her and she 's immensely popular among estonian kids . 
  a clip of it [ here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hizoop8uzby&amp;t ) . 
  what were the reasons for that ? 
  yeah they had their own totalitarian dictatorship to replace nazism . 
  and they co-started the war and are equally to blame for the destruction and loss !, 
  wonder how much smaller the soviet loss would have been if every infantry soldier had a weapon . 
  wow . 
  first of all , there are no records from before the great northern war , so who knows what happened before the 1700s . 
  secondly i have some baltic german heritage from only a hundred years ago . 
  thirdly i might have some russian heritage , but it is dubious as the name could be a coincidence . 
  fourthly my family tree besides these exceptions does indeed only include estonians ... 
  there is really nothing weird about it . 
  if you lack argumentation skills , why even enter the conversation ? 
  why did you think that this is what i got from your comment or that i am somehow distressed ? 
  and they are legal citizens by birth only if their parent was a citizen at the time o their biryh . 
  i am not blaming these people personally . 
  it will never be ok . russians came here illegally and it will remain so forever . 
  anyone 's personal status depends on themselves . 
   almost every single nation came to their current lands illegaly during an illegal occupation . 
  `` illegal '' can only be in the modern times . 
  there was no international law back then in the way we know today . 
  there are smaller russian old believer communities in estonia as well , they are much better integrated , much more respected by estonians and they 've never talked of any secessionist ideas . 
   we should split europe between celts and basques , and i 'm not even talking about colonial nations in americas and ocenia . 
  this is just empty bantering . 
  different situations . 
  estonians have never endangered russians living here , plus they came here illegally during an illegal occupation so they have no rights to self-determination . 
  although it sort of lacks in logic , does n't it ? 
  they have the right of self-determination to be independent , but not join another country , even after becoming `` independent '' . 
  i thought we already got into a territorial dispute !, 
  it does n't really help if you reveal your true self in the following comment . 
  shut up and [ live happily with the soviet army !, 
  the aliens came , we did n't create them . 
  the same root , but not the same name , was carried on for estonians . 
  plus , estonians themselves did n't use that root until the late 18th/early 19th century . 
  oh dear , poor latvia . . 
  give them a break , half their energy goes into not adding an - s into the end of each word . 
   i find it fascinating how similar are major historical dates of xx century in eastern europe . 
  german forces invading , russian forces retreating - german forces retreating , russian forces advancing - socialist bloc crumbling etc. 
  do n't you mean sc2red ? 
  how is that silencing ? 
  ah , let 's forget history and sleep better at nights ... 
   crimea does n't have a nation that want to live independent . 
  oh [ i member ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/deportation_of_the_crimean_tatars ) !, 
  is there always autumn ? 
   please tell me what russia would gain , in any way , by invading the baltics ? 
  dictatorships need foreign affairs victories to keep internal discontent away , especially in a weak economy . 
  plus to keep up the general strongman impression and also , since when does russia not have imperialist ambitions ? 
  this is why i reddit . 
  `` blind hate '' . 
  i 'm sure lots of people `` blindly '' hated nazi germany as well . 
  for a lot of years ... by your standard my country should also belong to russia ... 
  i am of course not [ fully ] denying that , but that is beyond the point here . 
  `` west will do '' is not how you organize legitimate referendums either . 
   while ukrainians silenced them in what way ? 
  officially estonia agrees to change the legal border ( as latvia already did ) . 
  the last attempt to sign a border treaty ended with the estonian parliament adding a preamble that mentioned the original border treaty , which included the soviet-era change of the [ previous ] legal border . 
  we still do n't have a ratified border treaty with russia . 
  it 's not like a ratified border treaty with them is necessary anyway , considering how much they respected the last one ...

   basically the same as any country really . 
  which is already the case . 
   those who have been living there before a change of government usually get citizenship . 
  that happened in 1918 . 
  our government lasted until 1940 until the country was illegally annexed . 
  everyone who was a citizen in 1940 and their descendants get automatic citizenship . 
  you are a kremlin shill if you demand more . 
  i do n't see their guilt here . 
   you do n't know what national minority is and you do because `` you made up its definition yourself '' ? 
   you do n't know how citizenship is how citizenship is ?? 
   all you can is calling other kremlin propagandists , you just do n't have enough knowledge on this topis to be worthy interlocutor sounds totally plausible . 
  a sad world view you have . 
  russia did n't give them citizenship in 1991 , that 's the basis of this issue . 
  no , it 's that their world order collapsed and they were n't the privileged minority anymore . 
  they were n't occupied when they joined , gosh ... 
  yes , but a slight temperature rise will probably make us suffer a lot more than that flooding , drought and famine in the rest of the world . 
  russian no . 
  1 : why is nato so strongly against us , we feel threatened , but we only want peace !, 
  russian no . 
  2 : nato wo n't stop russia , it 's too week and we will conquer you !, 
  i 'm gon na prepare two forged letters from both of you to each other . 
  it 's not meant to stop tank-tourists . 
  all children under 15 already have that in estonia , unless their parents objected ... 
   though i think they should really give citizenship to non-citizens we have been doing that since the very beginning . 
  all they need to do is apply and pass the test . 
   life sucks for people who have no citizenship in any country . 
  it certainly does n't suck as much as people here think it sucks . 
  otherwise , more people would have applied ... 
  you just said you came up with the definition of that term yourself !, 
  jesus f. christ , this is hilarious ... 
   members of german national minority do n't emigrated to poland , they were living here before 1939 , and this territories were annexed by poland after 1945 , so they become citzens of poland overnight , ah , ** just like ** russians in estonia , who lived here in 1940 . 
   they do n't come to poland , but poland come to them . 
  ah , unlike the russians in estonia , who came during the soviet occupation . 
   good example are polish people in latvia . 
  there is a group of polish people that live there since 16th century and they are considered national minority . 
  yeah , like * some * russian communities in estonia then . 
  we agree on so much , i do n't understand what we 're even arguing about anymore . 
  integration = / = assimilation and you people claim to know about the issue ... 
  integration = / = assimilation and you people claim to know about the issue ... 
  yes , a person , who actually knows a thing or two about estonian history , international law and the situation of russians in estonia is narrow-minded . 
  not the person , who knows very simplistic facts and is prone to believe kremlin propaganda and who ** very obviously ** knows absolutely nothing of international law . 
  no , not him - me !, 
   you do n't have to pick one between supporting the estonian government 's decision to have non-citizens , and supporting putin . 
  `` no to both '' is a choice too , and it 's the choice that / u/iwanttosaysmth and i pick . 
  you can be influenced by putin 's propaganda even if you are against him . 
   your first sentence - basically `` everybody who does n't agree with me is russian propaganda '' no , but if you repeat kremlin lies , then they still remain lies . 
   they actually hate russians , russian culture , russian language , hate russian minorities in their own country , and blame every russian citizen for the things putin does . 
  i have n't seen this much generalization even among the most anti-russian people in my country ... 
  you repeat this argument everywhere , but it includes just so many factual fallacies ... 
   you are resorting to personal attacks  insignificant fascist countries with no history the pot calling the kettle black, 
   we 're supposed to have some really high standards on this sort of thing . 
  we do . 
  we just do n't have simplistic standards like you propose . 
   i 'd still recommend suspending estonia 's and latvia 's membership over this i do n't wonder now why you are not among any kind of public leadership . 
   little insignificant fascist countries with no history lol , not biased at all !, 
   government entities have a bigger responsibility with regards to providing protection citizenship and statehood and should be expected to conduct themselves more professionally and self-lessly than individuals , but that does n't mean they have to provide for every whim of a stateless people . 
  indeed , it 's not just the local russians , who are to blame , but also russia itself . 
   you are one of the most stubborn people i met . 
  could it be because i have been right all along ? 
   i will write it in caps so maybe you 'll understand : does that mean that i have won ? 
   i just do n't agree with them . 
  can you accept that someone can have different view ? 
  you can disagree , but it only has value in this argumentation if you support them with good explanations , which you utterly fail to do . 
   they only said that lithuania chose different path because they have smaller russian minority . 
  exactly . 
  meaning they only did it so that folks like you could n't bother them with simplistic arguments ... 
  no , but anyone , who repeats its lies is a victim of kremlin propaganda . 
  automatic citizenship is not a human right . 
  please do n't speak of things you know nothing about . 
  and the chances of either of them succeeding are developing in the opposite situation . 
  so many have already opted for citizenship , only a small minority remains . 
  most of them are the elderly . 
  yet estonians are as against russian as an official language as ever . 
  yeah , and solidifying the illegal effects of the soviet occupation is not fair to estonians . 
  they have the right to apply for citizenship - some people make it sound like we are keeping slaves here . 
  you are telling this to a bunch of college freshmen . 
  dude , there were barely 1 million estonians in estonia at maximum . 
  and the number of russians at maximum in 1989 was 475,000 , which was 30 % of the population and ca . 
  35 % with other russophone immigrants . 
  said the immigrant ? 
  they were different people , ranging from useful idiots , hardline communist '' [ yestonians ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/yestonians ) '' ( those with heavy russian accents ) to nationalists in disguise . 
  i 'm sorry , it was very unique and it would lead to my current name in the database , 
  you clearly do n't understand the deterrence value of nato . 
   that the way baltic countries deals with national minorities is against international regulations and you take offense when i call you unintelligent ... how many times have i called you out for making shit up ? 
  you come up with your own definitions like `` national minority '' and what constitutes it and blame us for not agreeing with you ... 
   wow anybody who say something against baltic countries is suddenly putin 's puppet . 
  not a puppet perhaps , but you are definitely influenced by his propaganda . 
   for your information i despise this lunatic , and i 'm against russian imperialism as one can be irrelevant , considering my first sentence . 
   members of national minority have right to citizenship without any language test  a moot point here is : `` are russians in estonia and latvia a national minority or not ? '' . 
  my opionion is `` yes , they are '' . 
  what in your mind is a `` national minority '' ? 
  if one estonian lives in poland , is that not a national minority ? 
  can you find a non-arbitrary distinction somewhere between 1 % and 49 % ? 
  again , you are just making shit up ...  members of national minority have right to citizenship without any language test , because they have right to not know it . 
  but you just told me that i do n't have the right for polish citizenship without knowing polish ... 
   and after fullfiling several requirements ( knowing language is one of them ) you are a polish citizen breakthrough !, 
   you could be an active part of estonian organisations in poland , you can preserve and cultivate your estonian language , heritage and culture as long you want . 
  exactly what russians have in estonia . 
   there is no estonian national minority in poland lol , what ? 
   their nationality is german and they are a polish citizens .

  net neutrality `` debate '' maybe ? 
  the quality of education is rapidly falling in the us . 
  i guess the public policy of the us regards oil subsidies as a better place to pump money into , instead of educating the future of your country . 
  the us public policy is wrong in so many aspects that it is hard to even mention all of them . 
  and showing me a gdp chart wo n't really mean much .

  [ the president of twitter ( buzzfeed ) ] ( http://www.buzzfeed.com/maxseddon/the-president-of-twitter ), 
  we are just masters of staring at screens , being all cold and unsocial . 
  on a more serious note , i think the way our education is handled plays a large part in this . 
  many schools offer it lessons already in primary school . 
  in general , the government has also been very innovative with its policies . 
  we 've had the opportunity to start anew after the occupation and build our country in a way that fits today 's world . 
  we also have very few religious people , so progress is not hindered by backward policies inspired by religion , which is sadly quite often the case in countries like the us . 
  it 's true that the left wing is pretty vocal here . 
  but there are definitely right-wing supporters as well , myself as an individualist included . 
  it 's just a bit complicated to voice your opinion against the leftist crowd . 
  this is a very incomplete chart . 
  there are , in estonia alone , over 20 fighters currently stationed on high alert . 
  the same goes for other baltic states . 
  i do n't know about the other countries , but i suspect they are also missing some deployments . 
  nevertheless , i think it would be extremely cruel to force foreigners to learn this incredibly complicated language with all its rules and even more exceptions . 
  i 've tried explaining estonian declination to people , and it 's quite funny to watch them lose all hope in ever speaking this language after about 5 minutes . 
  that said , i really enjoy helping foreigners learn the language . 
  completely different story with people who come to live in estonia , however . 
  if they want to live here , they better make themselves familiar , at least at a basic level , with the local culture and language . 
  there was a pro-russian ~ ~ protest ~ ~ demonstration in tallinn ( estonia ) some time ago . 
  i think about 30 people showed up and half of them were press . 
  using the russian minorities in the baltics could be a bit difficult for putin , since they are generally not very unhappy with their country . 
  yet , at least . 
  closest to reform party ( right-wing , pro-eu ) , which is also my preference so far . 
  the quiz did a pretty good job . 
  and ... estonia . 
  do n't leave us out !, 
  why would the nato do that ? 
  violating the fundamental basis of their organization would only make them weaker and show the world that nato may as well not exist as a treaty , if it 's not followed . 
  with the difference being that we are now a member of nato , which means that declaring war on estonia would mean declaring war on every single nato member . 
  things are different nowadays , and you should know it . 
  your reasoning and explanation behind this ? 
  we have considerable military forces in estonia alone , with over 150 000 soldiers in reserve with military training , ready to be mobilized very fast should the need arise . 
  estonia has very strong diplomatic relations with western europe and the core members of nato . 
  i 'd really like to hear your arguments why the baltics should n't be members of nato . 
  tell me that western politicians are n't corrupt . 
  it 's a matter of priority it would seem . 
  do you value the progress our country has made in very little time , or do you dismiss all that because we still have problems , like every other country in the world . 
  we are most definitely not more eastern than northern european . 
  we are classified as northern europe by the un . 
  our economy , government , and most of all , our president all point towards the west , rather than east . 
  the teacher in question was an engineering teacher . 
  you would expect him to be somewhat above average in technology . 
  anecdotal indeed . 
  i suppose all public sector employees should be exempt from fines as well . 
  the money is coming from the state anyway . 
  nevermind that paying a fine actually leaves the person paying it with less money than he had before , no matter where that money came from , thus punishing him . 
   lol !, 
  solid argumentation there . 
   anyway , typical small-scale e-commerce is not a viable business strategy . 
  what ? 
  the amount of profitable small e-commerce sites shows exactly the opposite . 
  e-commerce is soaring all over the world . 
   especially since many of these sites actually buy their stuff from bigger e-commerce sites analogy : we should close all small - to medium-size retailers and boutiques because they order their products from a bigger distributor anyway . 
  the oldest , obviously . 
  the mother of all alphabets . 
  what are you even talking about ?

  how the hell is pink closer to teal than light red ? 
  mine once told me that the latin and all other alphabets were derived from the cyrillic alphabet . 
  when i insisted it 's the other way around , she called me disrespectful and ignorant towards the russian culture and history , while refusing to look it up on the internet . 
  if that is true for you , you are offended by ridiculously small things .

  at least that 's how i understood it . 
  in other words , what you 're supporting is segregation based on race . 
  if you 're a racist , at least say it as it is and be upfront about it . 
  they are usually dated indirectly , by the age of the sediment layers they are found in . 
  as a noun , it technically means * reminder . 
  ** estonia ** sahin - crackling , rustle , murmur ; probably because of the noise . 
  staatika - static lumesadu - snowfall ( less often used ), 
   russia has sheltered almost a million refugees from the ukraine and is not perturbed . 
  while i am not against accepting refugees , i think it 's really funny that you use this as an example . 
  russia is the one who annexed a part of ukraine and caused the large-scale conflict , it 's a bit hypocritical to praise them for accepting the refugees . 
  as others have said , it 's basically the detroit of europe . 
  it 's one of the poorest cities in belgium . 
  streets are full of drug addicts , criminals and prostitutes , especially at nighttime . 
  the crime rates are unbelievably high for a city in western europe . 
  the buildings are industrial and ugly . 
  all in all , i think you get the point . 
  absolutely . 
  brugge , mons ( where i lived ) , brussels and ghent were all really nice , among others . 
  [ apparently we got you with .5 % according to wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/importance_of_religion_by_country ) . 
  yes , i find it 's not suitable or particularly appropriate for a country which , by some stats , is the least religious in the world . 
  it 's just a bit weird to have it in the national anthem , that 's all . 
  well , i was living in belgium and wanted to visit as many places as possible . 
  there was an interesting industrial museum there . 
  but i guess i could have lived without seeing that particular piece of belgium , in hindsight . 
  i also came by train , and had to walk through the entire city and back . 
  it was ... interesting . 
  scary , but interesting .

  that 's just pure evil . . 
   i think he means he does n't need to imagine that as he 's already able to do almost everything online . 
  can confirm . 
  was a lame attempt at a joke . . 
  take that with a big grain of salt . 
  these experts we 're invited to estonia by keskerakond ( corrupt as hell , represents local russians ) . 
  the intent was to stir up controversy , like they lost because of e-voting . 
  keskerakond get 's very few e-votes , because their main supporters are senile old people . 
  so there is some shady dealing going on there ... 
   imagine you 'd be able to complete virtually all bureaucratic necessities online , in the comfort of your home . 
  yes ... imagine ... 
   a bit like american exceptionalism , but then with russians instead of americans ? 
  yes , the main difference is that the us actually is exceptional ... 
   saudi arabia that borders on conspiracy theory . 
  saudi arabia has every reason to keep prices down . 
  they are the lowest cost producer on the planet . 
  look at the supply of oil !, 
  they need to put an end to fracking asap . 
  sanctions on russia helps saudi arabia too . 
  russia needs western tech for drilling in the arctic and sanctions make that a lot harder . 
  right now we live in a deflationary environment . 
  commodities are down all across the board and this has nothing to do with russia . 
  not to mention we are looking at tougher climate rules and better green tech in the future . 
  better solar , better nuclear and lockheed martin is even talking about fusion with a straight face . 
  in 10-20 years the world will be different . 
  and petrostates like saudi arabia are shaking in their boots . 
  as they should be . 
  `` my grandfather rode a camel , my father rode a camel , i drive a mercedes , my son drives a land rover , his son will drive a land rover , but his son will ride a camel '', 
  yeah , it 's either u.s. or nothing . 
  germany is not trustworthy when it comes to politics with russia . 
  and it 's not like they have the capability to defend us anyway . 
  sweden demanding . 
  i 'm surprised anyone is even bothering talking to your deranged leaders , much less hearing their demands . 
   and other eu countries should & will send people to ee with forced quotas , the people who let that happen will be replaced next elections . 
  you will have anti-eu right wingers in charge , no more eu . . 
   i 'm just saying that it would not wipe out europe . 
  yes , it will !, 
  because the people will never accept it . 
  there would be war . . 
   you can say that it 's sweden 's problem etc etc , but in reality , we all know there 's only one leader in the eu that matters and that 's merkel . 
  guess which side she will come down on ? 
  then we will be looking for new leadership . 
  no way is merkel getting away with this . 
  she is already hated , soon germany will find that with merkel at the top , they will find it harder and harder to talk to other countries . 
   if anything this crisis tells us that globalization is unavoidable . 
  the refugee crisis has nothing to do with globalization . 
  we have no deals with the countries the refugees come from . 
  not our military allies , nor our trade allies . 
  an example of globalization would be intra-eu migration . 
  the refugee crisis is an example of weak leadership and german historical guilt , nothing else . 
  taking in so many refugees is clearly against the interests of the eu , so do what 's needed . . 
   sweden or germany or italy or greece have a problem , then you help - not talk of leaving . 
  all these countries have problems of leadership . 
  best way to fix that , is to let them stew in their own shit for a while . . 
   but always want to tap out the moment there is a crisis . 
  then stop the crisis . 
  stop letting people in . 
  when the most powerful countries act like weaklings , it 's time to tap out . 
  when the most powerful countries prefer migrants over keeping the eu unified and strong , it 's time to tap out ... 
   when at the brink of war , you 're not throwing stones at the fragile constructions that is the eu . 
  this is exactly what germany is doing now . . 
   in estonia eu was sold with `` no effect on our sovereignty '' , well that was a joke . 
  can confirm . 
  anyone who talked about an european superstate/federal europe was treated like a conspiracy theorist . . 
   oh , and i guess by your comment you support the swedish-sword dude 's his action . 
  because exactly what you are saying leads people to do stuff like that . 
  i do n't care about any swordsman . 
  i 'm talking about and organized and armed political resistance . 
   yeah , no , you ca n't just start killing people . 
  yes you can , just because you ca n't does not mean someone else ca n't . 
  the ability to use violence , is what makes a country a country . 
  works for unions too . 
  it will happen either with the approval of people like you or without it . 
  it will come down to choosing sides eventually ... 
  first you need to say no more and secure the borders . 
  the migrants who disobey and break the law , do so at their own risk . 
  if we really are entering an era of mass migration , we have two options . 
  stop it right now and minimize the damage to the eu . 
  stop it later , with no eu and wars/civil wars all across europe . 
  the second option involves a lot more blood obviously . 
   and there is nothing we can do about that . 
  yes we can . 
  militarily it 's not even a challenge . 
  if we say '' no more !, 
  '' , we have the firepower to back it up . 
  i do n't disagree with your view of the reality at all , but saying we are powerless , is just not accurate . 
  in terms of attracting the worlds most talented , i agree , it should be simpler . 
  but that 's not what the refugee crisis is about . . 
   eu because people like you refuse to accept reality . 
  well there are a lot of people like me . 
  and what would that reality be ? 
   there is no special bond just because of citizenship i 'm not talking about citizenship . 
  i 'm talking about ethnicity , history and cultural identity . 
  these are the things that keep people together . 
  they are absolutely essential for the survival of a country . 
  the only reasons estonia exists at all and why people would lay down their lives protecting it . . 
   only because history made me austrian it does n't mean that i feel connected to all of them . 
  i like my family and friends but apart from that ... well that 's just idealistic nonsense . 
  i bet if i drop you off at a remote estonian town , you 'll start missing home real soon . 
  there are differences and differences should be respected , pretending we are all the same gets us nowhere . .

  what exactly could go wrong ? 
  everything could go wrong . 
  and likely will . 
  i 'm with you on this , protect the borders at all costs . 
  better to do it now and with smaller casualties than later . 
  also the political risk is huge . 
  if this goes south , the people in charge will be replaced . 
  if this goes south really really bad , they will be replaced with the likes we have not seen in power since ww2 . . 
   it 's not as if whole africa will be submerged and all the problems could be solved with africa not popping kids like crazy . 
  the life expectancy is not that long in africa for some reason ... you are thinking in absolutes . 
  most africans can barely afford food . 
  arable land is already becoming scarce and the demand for food is rising globally . 
  extreme weather events and crop failures will come a lot sooner than all the apocalyptic stuff . 
  that 's enough to set africa moving . . 
   i 've tented in the snow , in a regular tent with a regular sleeping bag . 
  it 's not a problem . 
  yeah living in a tent for months in the damp is a bit different to '' i 've tented '' . 
  vw shares look really good right now for the long term . . 
  food calories are a lot harder to come by than calories for heating . 
  if you waste more food on someone than they can produce , it 's a net loss . 
  if they ca n't even leave the house they are useless . 
  food is the main issue here , there was never enough . 
  3 months of summer and barren land the rest of the year . 
  also i 'm not exactly sure about the history , but are n't russians relatively new to the north , compared to say the uralic peoples ? 
  if you can make the argument that our climate has somehow affected our temperament , i would venture to guess it would take thousands of years . 
  it 's easier to survive if you do n't carry around dead weight . 
  people are not equally gifted . 
  if you have a weak link in the group , it makes it harder for everyone else . 
  that would be my logic if you think in terms of survival in the north . . 
   tens of billions into the project try a trillion . 
  a billion is something a start up can raise in today 's world . 
  i 'm talking the kind of money us spends on a war or pumps out as qe . 
  with that kind of money , you can move pretty fast ... 
   hey - it 's not necessarily a bad thing . 
  such a group thinking is more valuable to the society as a whole opposed to the individualism of latvians and estonians . 
  disagree . 
  individualism means better competition , competition brings results . 
  group think tends to bog down the talent . 
  so instead of letting the best and brightest shine and lead the way , you dumb everything down to the lowest common denominator . 
  the result is stagnation and lack of flexibility . . 
   what are the reasons for their intense , violent hate that goes far beyond simple exclusion though ? 
  shitty life in general would be one of the reasons . 
  you have to direct the frustration somewhere . 
  also what i 've noticed , russians are more group oriented as opposed to estonians , who are more individualistic . 
  they also have a tendency to believe in the '' good tzar '' types . 
  very prone to cults of personality . 
  being seen as '' normal '' ( whatever that means ) to the rest of the group is important to them . 
  so it 's easy for someone with authority to voice and spread idiotic ideas because people in general keep each other in check . 
  in the ussr people we 're spying on each other and snitching to the authorities all the time . . 
  i do n't remember if it was this year or the year before . 
  we had 10c in january and it lasted most of the month . 
  i do n't remember that ever happening in the past . 
  i loved it though . 
  1-2 months of winter sounds good to me . . 
  there is no other option . 
  plan b is war ... 
   civil resistance to nuclear power and the slow permit processes alone would mean that building even the first batch of new reactors would be a 15-year-long process . 
  by the time we could have hundreds of reactors the global co2 concentration would already be at 450 ppm and we 'd be well on our way to +3 c warming . 
  it 's more likely than curbing emissions . 
  if this truly is a matter of life or death . 
  those who resist will have to be dealt with . . 
   you do n't need investment . 
  we need a worldwide ban on fossil fuels . 
  we need to be able to go to the small mining towns in west virginia and tell them that no more husbands or sons will be harmed working in those nasty mines . 
  put the crack pipe down ... 
  i work in the center of the city and i 've never seen so many black people here . 
  do n't know what to make of it . 
  spillover from sweden ? 
  carbon pledges ? 
  i ca n't think of anything more naive . 
  the only way to stop this , is to make fossil fuels irrelevant . 
  investments in better nuclear power plants are needed . 
  also investments in fusion research . 
  this needs to be massive , like a marshal plan for climate/energy . 
  cutting back carbon is a pointless activity when you do n't have an alternative . 
  humankind does not cut back , it builds bigger and better ... 
  only problem i have with the death penalty is the fact that innocents get executed . 
  that 's a really really really big problem though . 
  for that reason alone i 'm leaning on the '' no '' side ... 
  personally i do n't care . 
  either one works for me , as long as i see what i 'm doing . 
   what planet are you living on to think people go out of their way to find incandescent bulbs when they can just find cfls at their local supermarket ... 
  ridiculous . 
  in the north ? 
  a lot of people and you can buy them easily . 
  many complain that the white light is too sterile and cold and prefer the warm glow of incandescent bulbs . 
  if you lived here in the cold and dark it would make perfect sense . . 
   i highly doubt the average person breaks the law for this and goes to stores that are not targeted to non-industrial customers , or buys them online illegally ... lol what planet do you live on ? 
  especially in ee people will consume what they want . 
  in the ussr everything was illegal , no one cared . 
  plus it 's dictated by the eu , so not really legitimate in the peoples eyes ... 
  lol those packages are cool . 
  10/10 would buy !, 
  trust them to lead europe in a direction that is beneficial for europe . 
  trust them with investments ... france is unpredictable for anyone who is not french . 
  germany has a history of fucking up and is basically trying to rule over people it tried to exterminate in the past ( instant -1 to trust ) . 
  also germany has a strong ideological bent , ca n't count on germany to act in the rational interests of it 's own and europe 's people . 
   the uk has n't been doing shit for the eu for a long time and it 's already `` dominated '' by france and germany . 
  kicking the uk wo n't change that . 
  if the uk is officially out of the eu , it will be a huge blow to eu-s credibility .

  kazakhstan needs russia to export their fuels , russia is happily doing business with kazakhstan because it makes them dependent on russia . 
  doubt putin has any motives to have greater control over them . 
  think about chechnia and kadyrov . 
  putin has enough power over him and the republic , but still let 's him have his own little country within . 
  besides , russia seems to have little to win with actual military intervention in central asia ( though russia would absolutely dominate and the west could n't care less if russia decided to do something ) . 
  might be true . 
  however , looking at estonia or probably any other ex-soviet country , the industries were n't just shut down , they simply could n't keep going . 
  since the production relied on free or super cheap raw materials coming from all around ussr , when the borders closed and the old distribution network collapsed , it simply became impossible to keep the factories running . 
  some factories managed to gather enough capital to buy materials at market price and found some markets to sell their stuff , but you have to remember that the markets also shrank considerably , since nobody wanted the shit being produced . 
  in ussr , you , as a manager of a company did n't need to worry about selling your product , since everything was deficit . 
  but with the market opening to the west , but closing to the east , the products were simply unable to just compete . 
  you had to sell your stuff . 
  therefore companies and their managers had to change their entire way of working , when the ussr collapsed . 
  many companies failed to do that ( i 'd say that for a reason ) and closed down . 
  i 'm positively surprised about belarus and armenia . 
  i mean , belarus has had the same growth as other baltic states . 
  and armenia . . well they are still relatively poor , but 600 + % is quite remarkable . 
  would n't have thought that armenia has had faster growth than azerbaijan . 
  just saying that everyone in soad is american-armenian , not just serj . 
  half french ? 
  estonia can stand 2 weeks . 
  the question is how quickly nato reacts . 
  not just militarily , but primarily politically . 
  i believe though that in such an immediate case , the democratic processes of declaring war can and will be shortened . 
  i hope, 
  why ca n't the servers be in estonia , while the embassies stay in foreign territory ? 
  ah , the good old soviet/russian technic of calling everyone fascists . 
  the problem is that eesti energia or enefit in latvia had a large marketshare ( 15-20 % ) , but since latvia does have a power market , enefit is forced to buy power from latvian market to resell it to its customers . 
  however , since latvian power market does de facto not work , since around 95 % of all power deals in latvia are done directly between the producer and the customer , the market prices do n't reflect reality and can be many times more expensive than the actual price that companies sell outside of the market . 
  therefore eesti energia lost 10m euros last year and decided to leave latvian market . 
  since latvia is fucking with their market , trade between estonia-latvia has died off . 
  and even if it did work , the transmission capacities along estonia-latvia , latvia-lithuania , lithuania-poland are too small to actually feasibly export power all the way to germany , although some arbitration is possible , though more likely through sweden/denmark . 
  not a solution . 
  and not only for reason / u/dv1312 said , but also the fact that nuclear power plants are very rigid in changing their production and therefore needs other power plants to cover the temporary differences between market demand and supply . 
  the most common power plant for these operations is gas , because it is very easy to regulate the amount of electricity being produced with gas . 
  you could use coal or oil power plants as well , but gas is by far the best ( and cleanest ) of them all . 
  i do n't have any citations . 
  my father told me that if you go bankrupt in europe , you 're a loser . 
  if you go bankrupt in usa and start again , people know that you are willing to take risks , know what to avoid to not go bankrupt and are regarded with much higher credibility . 
  heard similar things while studying economics by some professors . 
  well , serbia acknowledged the referendum so it 's hardly comparable . 
  but the point i was making remains ( that not all people have right for self-determination ) since 45 % of the people in montenegro did n't get their will . 
  in case of a diplomatic breakup , it 's probably rather simple , especially if there was previous political division ( ussr , czechoslovakia ) where the distribution is done diplomatically and usually among the previous lines ( most of companies , ministries etc in estonia belonged to estonian ssr , so they also remained under estonian republic ) and some anomalies are probably exchanged ( there were intra-national companies such as certain military industries , that belonged to ussr 's central government , even though they existed in estonia , they were given/taken by estonia under their own control ) . 
  federal property such as military is primarily divided by physical location ( bases in estonia would go under estonian control ) , with probably the previous federal governments successor ( in ussr case russia ) having an upper hand ( russia retained several military assets in now foreign lands ) , but this would all be diplomatically dealt with ( it takes time , last russian troops left estonia in 1994 and countries such as ukraine or georgia never reached a diplomatic solution to expel russian bases ) . 
  in case of a non-diplomatic break up it 's probably a case of civil war and whoever has de facto control over an asset will most successfully incorporate it . 
  in crimea military assets and troops loyal to ukraine will take what they have ( or is left on them after russians take away what they think is necessary ) and return to ukraine . 
  i would bet that if any companies and otherwise non-military assets in crimea is left for ukrainians after all of this , they will probably voluntarily give up the control or will simply be forced to . 
  yeah , i do n't know why i wrote that . 
  scotland is allowed to leave with a referendum , since scotland is an equal country to england or wales . 
  crimea was allowed to have a referendum in 1992 and they chose ukraine , after that a constitution was instituted that does not allow secession without an across-the-country referendum . 
  i agree that kosovo , south-sudan and other cases have made the lines blurry and in a way , they have to be blurry . 
  this is a paradoxical situation with two opposite practices and it has no final solution ( besides for absolute anarchy perhaps ) . 
  so how fucking far do we go with that ? 
  do i have the right for self determination . 
  i do n't want to pay taxes and declare independence ? 
  well , i 'd like that , but you 'd all be shitting on me if i tried doing that . 
  or let 's have a more realistic example : russia starts provocations , protests in narva . 
  narva city council is overrun by protesters and they decide to declare independence . 
  they do n't have a real predecessor , but they may claim something like commune of estonia or something else . 
  so do they have the right to split off from estonia ? 
  do they have the right to split of even if 25 % of the people living there are against it ? 
  do these 25 % have a right to re-declare dependence to estonia ? 
  where do you draw the line ? 
  you do n't . 
  the lines are already down and they 're down for a reason - to stop shit like this from happening and we all dying . 
  borders are . 
  go cry me a river . 
  why though ? 
  why should they be allowed to depart if they so want ? 
  constitutionally they can only secede if the entirety of ukraine support it . 
  it gives a precedent - so could narva or part of tallinn in estonia decide to secede etc etc. 
  why ? 
  they have never had an army . 
  even if they did , they could n't fight an invasion from anyone . 
  they know they have strategic value and other countries are willing to fight for that . 
  iceland has no point to invest in military , rather than diplomacy and choosing the right allies that find iceland 's important enough to protect . 
  fracking . 
  yeah , sure it 's dirty , but dirtier than financing a corrupt and aggressive russian government ? 
  nuclear and solar/wind are only solutions to electricity production , but only about a third of all energy consumption comes from electricity , other thirds are fuels for transports and also heating , where gas plays a major role . 
  in the short run , alternative to russian gas is not getting rid of gas , but developing our own gas production capabilities . 
  usa has managed to bring down gas prices three-fold thanks to fracking and i believe europe has similar capabilities . 
  an interesting switcharoo - ansip to the european commission and kallas to pm of estonia . 
  there 's been some arguing about how democratic this all is , but there 's really nothing stopping it . 
  i think most are relieved that ansip finally leaves ( he 's become more and more distanced from reality after 9 years of being the pm ) , but getting kallas back is really not something i can cheer for ( he has had multiple corruption cases , the most recent one came out today ) and he has an awful moustache . 
  we would n't be independent from russian gas in the sense that we would n't buy gas from them . 
  we would . 
  russian gas is pretty much a must . 
  but what the gas terminals and pipelines would give , is an alternative to russian gas , that in case russia tries something ( ups the prices by three-fold , decides to cut the gas during winter etc. ), 
  we would have alternatives ( even if conventionally more expensive than the russian gas ) . 
  more importantly , it opens up the possibility for competition . 
  five years ago it would have been impossible for anyone to sell gas to estonia in any reasonable quantity , because all the pipelines only lead to russia and we do n't have reasonable storage facilities for lng . 
  now though , competition will be made possible and it ( hopefully ) means russian gas monopoly will fade over time . 
  -1 for good relations as well , they also have military access which takes their stability to -3, 
  but it 's true . 
  many people in eastern europe joined the nazis not because of their great love for hitler and his policies , but because they were just recently fucked hard by the soviets . 
  this is neither black or white , apologism has nothing to do with it . 
  and kaliningrad is perfect for cutting the baltics off from the rest of nato . 
  some banks will demand extra backings if house values drop . 
  it also makes credit more expensive and will put the house owner in a worse situation if he fails to pay regular payments ( just as you said ) . 
  given that millions of homes were lost for that reason during the last recession , there is no way it can be denied .

  russia is not going to follow any agreements if that suits them better , just like it to this day violates the fifth article of the peace plan for 2008 russian-georgian war ( the withdrawal of russian military forces to the lines they held before hostilities broke out ) . 
  new peace plans , etc , would simply give russia an advantage since others would have to restrain themselves , whereas russia would simply piss on its obligations . 
  before suggesting any new agreements , could the `` pacifists '' please make russia fulfill its existing obligations ? 
  actually , authoritarian regimes care very much about their image both home and abroad since positive image validates their rule . 
  the games are also personally extremely important for authoritarian rulers due to photo op opportunities the vast number of visiting heads of state , sports stars and celebrities offer , not to mention rulers feeding off the praise of organisers , fans and athletes . 
   wrong , upon creation of a file , the date ( although computers , so fake-able ) is stored in its metadata , moreover , it is stored inside the file itself , depending on encoding format . 
  ( in case with mpeg4 , afaik it is in two places , for audio ( and its codec ) and for video , separately ) . 
  to begin with , file creation date shows only when the file was created . 
  it does n't say anything about contents . 
  for example , i have a folder full of 3d models that have identical creation date , but actually got their contents over a period of several months - this is because i copy-pasted a single template file , and then saved models into them . 
  the only way to actually tell when a file was created ( along with its contents ) is to digitally sign it by placing the file in a mathematically secure container , contents of which can not be altered without breaking the container and the timestamp it carries . 
   so let 's disregard everything , just because it 's user created ? 
  in [ `` comrade j '' ] ( http://www.amazon.com/comrade-untold-secrets-russias-america/dp/0425225623 ) , the head of russian intelligence station in new york describes how he would often visit a public library to post conspiracy theories to online message boards . 
  since reading that , i 've become quite suspecting of even the most marginal , geocities-grade sources and of their true origin . 
   1 ) metadata was wrong , file created before plane was shot down . 
  but there was excuse for that found ( bug in mpeg4 encoding ) . 
  unless the file was digitally signed by an external and trustworthy authority , there 's no way to tell when a certain file was created . 
  i did n't mean to be nasty , but i 've watched the un live stream long enough to take `` condemnations '' and `` grave concerns '' with a certain degree of sarcasm . 
  i 'm sorry if i offended you . 
   trust me if russia launch a true offensive on our neighbourhood i 'll be the first to condemn them . 
  what a relief . 
  paid for by the cia , you forgot to add . 
   though i must say that considering the length of our land border , i do n't see how mistrals would be too important if they attacked us directly . 
  military experts [ expect a landing operation ] ( http://www.postimees.ee/26695/leo-kunnas-eestlased-peavad-oma-riiki-ise-kaitsma ) targeting tallinn , carried out with ivan rogov class landing ships and helicopters launched from mistrals . 
  by the time land forces cross the border , all state institutions would 've been taken over , resulting in a total paralysis . 
  this is also a key fear of those - like [ the former head of the defense forces ] ( http://maaleht.delfi.ee/news/uudised/arvamus/ants-laaneots-ega-putin-rahune.d?id=68626365 ) - who opposed recent reforms that reorganized the previous four regional commands into one , located in tallinn . 
  take tallinn , and you 'll have the whole country on the knees - and mistrals are extremely well suited for such task . 
   so obvious a child can see it except that germany had one of the largest defense deals next to mistral 's , and already suspended it . 
   now if you want impossible things , russia attacking eu/nato is one . 
  this is wishful thinking . 
  it actually takes very little to bite large chunks off of the eu . 
  russia needs to construct an [ ethnic conflict ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bronze_night#events_surrounding_relocation ) and make it violent enough for the government to lose legitimacy in the eyes of russian ethnic groups , then instigate more violence ( `` separatists '' ) or right away send in `` russian peacekeepers '' at the request of locals ( crimea ) before anyone has the time to react . 
  such internal conflict bypasses all eu and nato protocols , and is considered the most likely scenario . 
   uk and germany too have sold to russia for example . 
  both countries have halted all defense exports to russia . 
  for instance , germany 's rheinmetall was building a combat training facility in russia , but this project has now been scrapped . 
  [ whataboutism . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/whataboutism ), 
   more about future consequences as i said proceeding with the sale at this point is rewarding aggressive behaviour . 
  this , too , has `` future consequences . '', 
  because france chose to sell arms and transfer technology to an authoritarian regime in the first place . 
  there is absolutely no reason why other countries should be grounding french business risks , especially when many of those countries restrained themselves from selling arms to russia because of the risks involved . 
  it 's like a double punishment - first they are n't profiting from arms sales , and then they have to pay for the losses of those who miscalculated ( or chose to ignore ) associated risks . 
   such a big hit 0,05 % of french exports by value during the four-year deal . 
  oh wow , such a big hit . 
  how will you survive ? 
  in comparison , the recent [ anti tax-fraud campaign ] ( http://www.english.rfi.fr/economy/20140521-france-nets-18-billion-euros-anti-tax-fraud-drive ) brought home more than the total value of the whole mistral deal . 
  this is nothing short of blackmail . 
  france was n't going to share the profits with others , and i ca n't see why others should share the losses .

  this thread also reminded me of a great story about [ getting around in damascus ] ( http://ibnsifr.blogspot.co.uk/2013/06/the-end-of-line-microbus-map-of-damascus.html ) .

  very rarely used . 
  local airport air traffic control ( dealing with landings , takeoffs , and low-flying aircraft that may interfere with the former ) has very little to do with enroute air traffic control . 
  at the altitude mh17 was flying , unit called dnipropetrovsk acc was responsible for relevant services , located 350 km away and untouched from fighting . 
  mh17 was flying at 10 000 m . a mere 600 m higher or lower would not have made any difference . 
  no , i mean leprechauns . 
   pro-nazi makes me chuckle every time i read it . 
  why not accuse leprechauns while you 're at it . 
  there does n't have to be a storm . 
  high-flying jets also take advantage of [ jet streams ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jetstream#aviation ) , which can bring immense time/fuel savings , and there 's a whole [ north atlantic track system ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/north_atlantic_tracks ) that issues twice a day the most efficient routes for crossing the atlantic .

  here 's an [ airway map ] ( http://skyvector.com/?ll=47.91081934320926,39.21377563774842&amp;chart=304&amp;zoom=2 ) if anyone 's interested . 
  mh17 was on route l980 heading for tamak . 
  full flight plan : ** arnem ** * ul620 * ** suvox ** * uz713 * ** osn ** * ul980 * ** mobsa ** ** povel ** ** sui ** * l980 * ** utolu ** * l980 * ** ldz ** * m70 * ** bembi ** * l980 * ** pekit ** * l980 * ** tamak ** * a87 * ** tirom ** * a87 * ** mamed ** * b449 * ** ranah ** * l750 * ** zb ** * g201 * ** bi ** ** murli ** ** tiger ** * l333 * ** kkj ** * l759 * ** put ** * r325 * ** vih ** * a464 * ** dakus ** names in bold are navigation points , in italic are routes connecting them . 
  except that the flight was to continue on route a87 , for which russia was responsible . 
  [ here 's a map . 
  ] ( http://skyvector.com/?ll=47.91634203904656,39.312377932671694&amp;chart=304&amp;zoom=3 ) mh17 was travelling along route l980 from pekit towards tamak . 
  in layman terms , any changes to route segments leading up to russian border were subject to approval by russians since these determined the entry point into russian airspace . 
  it 's not like mh17 somehow snuck close to the conflict zone without anyone knowing it , thus it is irrelevant if the flight plan was changed or not . 
  a major route between europe and asia goes over my house and i often follow airliners through binoculars . 
  while the type of aircraft can be identified even with naked eye based on the number of engines/contrails , the shape and position of wings , etc , it is usually not possible to see what 's painted on their sides . 
  see [ this gallery ] ( http://flickrhivemind.net/tags/rnav,spotting/interesting ) of photos taken through a telescope . 
  what 's painted on the sides does n't even matter much . 
  the number of contrails would 've been a much easier way of telling the difference - putin 's il-96 has four engines ( and thus four contrails ) , boeing 777 has two - a detail that went unnoticed in [ russia today 's article ] ( http://rt.com/news/173672-malaysia-plane-crash-putin/ ) . 
   and has almost the same markings . 
  which would not be visible looking from below , more than 10 km away . 
  an international air route went over the region , and flights above 32 000 ft ( mh17 was flying at 33k ) were deemed safe by both ukrainian and russian authorities . 
  a portable anti-aircraft missile would indeed be unable to reach even half that altitude . 
   i thought it was shut down by separatists ? 
  better blame putin . 
  it 's really the one and the same . 
   my point is that we should have acted earlier in the direction of preventing an escalation of the situation . 
  your suggestion is that we should have escalated the situation earlier . 
  the tragedy of the situation is that the very act of not wanting to escalate the situation ultimately escalated it . 
  had the european powers agreed to stand for ukrainian territorial integrity in an effective manner as soon as the issue arose , there probably would not have been a rogue buk near donetsk yesterday . 
   and what do you mean draw the line ? 
  a proper response to the invasion of crimea would 've been cutting putin-supporting oligarchs off from their luxury villas in france , expelling their children from oxford , seizing their assets - like [ kasparov suggested ] ( http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/sb10001424052702303824204579422971651210180 ) . 
  in other words , making putin useless to oligarchs to the point where they 'd ditch him . 
  what 's the point of being a billionaire if a random schmuck in poland can grab a ryanair ticket to go see the eiffel tower , but you 're stuck in russia due to visa ban ? 
  we do n't use coal . 
  we use oil shale , [ mined in north-east estonia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eesti_energia_kaevandused ) . 
   people are n't just going to have a `` colder winter '' . 
  they 're going to have the coldest winter in their lives and i can assure you this is going to have a severe impact on tens of milions of people . 
  this is nothing but fearmongering . 
  for example , you list estonia and finland as 100 % depending and predict devastating effects , but if we maintain a cool head and look at other figures too , we find that both estonia and finland rely on russian gas for only ~ 9 % of total energy needs .

  i [ ca n't ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/81/39/58/8139585abd5d0358c12eb1116704e396--funny-memes-funny-pics.jpg ) believe you just said that . 
  sorry for hurting your feelings , `` macedonian '' muh heritage , muh succession . 
  my god . . what if it 's one of putins secret agents who spilled the sekrit dokumints ??? 
  the truth is out there, 
  no , real macedonians are greek . 
  you 're obviously butthurt and retarded , i feel sorry for you , every day must be a challenge to get through . 
  sorry to disappoint but i 'm not interested in playing games with you . 
  what do you mean ? 
  i get it , greek history is like a juicy slice of meat . 
  it 's full of history , culture and famous people , but you 'll never be macedonian . 
  you 're as much as related to them as finns are related to italians . 
  except the funny thing is that estonians actually are uralic , i get it , your slavic feelings are hurt because most of the world does n't recognize your deluded idea of being true successors of the macedonian empire . 
  you 're not and never will be macedonian , you 're slavic . 
  you fall under the category of slavs and macedonians were not slavic . 
  well they did raise the monument to alexander the great although he is greek , so i suppose they do consider themselves hellenic , successors or whatever . 
  it 's one of those balkan countries i refer to as ` porno ' - it 's just a mess . 
  except that this time russia has permission to be there by the syrian government . 
  i 'm not turning off adblock to read this , sorry . 
  i personally find it ridiculous how a bunch of slavs decided to call themselves macedonian and basically embrace greek history for themselves . 
  to be honest tallinn 's old town looks better . . 
  and to think that we had him in tallinn with some people actually waking up to take pictures of his motorcade and wave at his car , hoping he would give a shit . 
  what would an an-2 be doing near finnish airspace anyway ? . . 
  personally i 'd be scared to sit in that thing , let alone fly it over water . 
  we have n't got [ much ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/estonian_air_force#aircraft ) to violate anyone 's airspace with . . 
  lithuania ? 
  are you telling me that you personally had a choice whether or not you should ally with us ? 
  ofc not , us does n't have allies but interests , just like any big country . 
  i never said anything about being occupied by the united states , lmao . 
  lol , choose to be allied with usa , really ? 
  yes , the united states and the rest of europe would much rather sanction russia and have diplomatic negotiations with them rather than going to war . 
  no one will ever start world war 3 over an irrelevant country such as estonia or any other tiny turd bordering russia . 
  as long as russia is n't pushed into a corner in the baltic sea , there is nothing to fear . 
  i doubt estonia , latvia and lithuania even pose a threat to them , kaliningrad oblast alone is stronger than these three combined . 
  fucking search it yourself about russia joining nato . 
  `` hurr durr that 's not excuse for invasion '' - a fucking country is getting cornered in a region , of course they 're going to do something about it , welcome to the fucking world you stupid crybaby . 
  nato troops ? 
  the amount of nato troops near petersburg is irrelevant , four abrams tanks and a couple of thousand soldiers is nothing . 
  i 'm sorry to disappoint you but nato presence in baltic 's is just to calm down the hysterical imbeciles . 
  as i said , i 'm aware of all those things , i did n't figure your sashlik loving ass would n't figure it out by itself . 
  i love how you think that i 'm not aware of the fact that estonia is easy to invade due to poor terrain and basically no army and that we 've a lot of russians . 
  i 've nothing to admit since i know these things . 
  and please , go with the classic , assume i 'm russian just because i 'm not as deluded and retarded as you are . 
  just know that this exercise is just that , an exercise , no one gives a shit about your country . 
  my hero putin , i love how personal you 're starting to get , calling people morons and assuming they 're russian just because they 're not on the same boat with your hairy georgian ass . 
  he would n't fucking want to invade estonia because there is nothing to gain from it . 
  i said it 's a weak debate because those are such stupid , weak reasons . 
  `` uuugh he would invade you just because it 's easy . '', 
  i 've a hard time believing anyone would want your bare ass country , but your tie eating president sure did a great job . 
  such a weak debate , putin finds estonia worthy for conquering because it 's much easier and has a large russian minority . 
  i was hoping you 'd list the gains , maybe resources but nah . 
   putin lies and manipulates , just like every politician on earth but i guess the americans are exceptional especially for georgians and estonians . 
  putin clearly stated that he is n't interested in war with nato and that would be a disaster , but schizoprenich morons must have a scary boogie to be afraid of or else uncle sam wo n't have any weapons to sell and land to use for their interests , or should i say `` protect from russians '' . 
  you fail to realize that crimea was annexed just because of it 's black sea connection and naval base . 
  russia has enough power in the baltic sea region , if anything nato made us a target in case a war breaks out , but that 's the destiny of smaller countries , the big choices are made behind closed doors . 
  and yes , putin has suggested joining nato , i suggest you to look it up . 
  if finland is not worth conquering , why estonia is ? 
  there is nothing here , it 's a piss poor country with nothing to gain from . 
  us would n't get into an open conflict with russia , that 's the most idiotic thing i 've read . 
  i doubt us would give two shits about estonia at that time , in fact i believe it would n't care at all , just like it did n't really give much fucks about your country . 
  if russia had plans to build bases , they definitely would find a reason to . 
  political support is insignificant when bullets start to fly , and it 's also a waste of fucking taxpayer money . 
  russia had a less organized army but with it 's size it could 've taken estonia , it 's not even up to debate whether or not they could . 
  even now we do n't have an airforce or navy , sure the names exist but in reality it 's 0 . 
  us inflicting pain on russia , how ? 
  russia in fact wanted to join nato but was rejected , i guess we really needed an evil boogeyman or else there would be no reason to buy weapons from the united states if we 're all friends . 
  do n't be amazed , i 'm not going to shit talk russia , wave an american flag and talk about how evil they are and how good we are . 
  but it 's a classic , let 's get personal instead and talk about my nationality which is definitely russian since i 'm not talking shit , am i right ? 
  we could 've gotten on pretty well with russia , finland has talks with them about energy , tourism and economy , meanwhile we discuss missiles with us . 
  well , to be honest that 's what diplomats are , spies . 
  did n't have the stomach for it ? 
  before even joining the eu and nato we barely had a military . 
  russia would 've overrun us in a day , what the fuck are you talking about ? 
  i doubt anyone would give any fucks about russia occupying some small , irrelevant nation . 
  finland and russia get along just fine , if you have n't heard , then just recently putin had visited finland and had talks about energy , trade and tourism . 
  meanwhile we call our `` friends '' to discuss bringing more weapons and soldiers to up keep . 
  what do you want russians to do about estonia ? 
  we 've constant propaganda made to hate them , not a day goes by without news outlets serving up new steaming shit about how bad their economy is , how rusty their tanks are but for some reason we 're still supposed to be scared shitless of them . 
  russia , just like any major country has it 's own interests , you do n't expect them to give up every strategic location to us just not to be seen as the ` bad guy ' by some three irrelevant balts . 
  if moldova and ukraine + georgia would be in nato , it would be a good bye call for russia in the black sea , and they do n't want that . 
  for some time , russia was n't even a threat , in fact putin proposed to join nato , his proposal was declined and i 'm not surprised why . 
  the world or more specifically europe needs a scary boogeyman to keep the wheels rolling . 
  how else is russia supposed to react to nato 's expansion ? 
  if crimea would n't have been annexed , they would 've lost a huge portion of control over the black sea and their naval base . 
  traditonal estonian history - i guess we 're sticking to our traditions just like our forefathers , being controlled by others . 
  sure , we get to fly our flag and sing , talk in our languages but it 's the big desicions that are made by others . 
  our castrated government does n't reject anything from the eu or us , any order is always carried out without questions . 
  our ideas will never be heard since we 're a small , irrelevant nation , we 're a liability . 
  we rely on others , nato to protect us , russia to supply us with gas and so on . 
  if russia wants baltics so bad , why did n't they invade us before we joined nato and eu ? 
  it 's funny how as long as you claim your military exercises are to `` protect against agression '' you 're all set , innocent . 
  but when russia conducts military exercises and does n't let itself get strangled like a dog by having nato countries surround it 's borders ; they 're the bad guys . 
  i hate to break it to all georgians , but you 'll never join nato as your conflict with south-ossetia and abkhazia are frozen and will stay that way , if nato were to help it would give a legitimate reason for russia to interfere . 
  some people here indeed believe that if war between estonia and russia were to break out , the united states would come to our aid like a shitting dog hurrying outside . 
  big countries like russia and the united states have interests , not friends , so everytime here someone says `` oh my god our murrrrican friends have come to protect us '' i just sigh , because in my mind no one would want to go to war with russia over an innsignificant , irrelevant country .

  and make sweden a potential target for russian missiles in case there are nato bases in there ? . .

   yes . 
  the other way is right at your border . 
  i think it is good with coutries that fit more to russia also work together with them . 
  they dont need to be in the eu yeah , wait a few years . 
  the european left is dying , you will be in the minority soon enough . .

  also , how was your jaanip\u00e4ev ? 
  this will not tackle anything . 
  this will be the end of the eu . 
  and that still leaves germany with the refugees and a lot shittier position in the world . . 
  unless there is a clear limit to the refugees and a clear effort to protect eu borders , there will be no compromise . . 
   `` he 's a brave man fighting for the cause , we must follow his example !! '', 
  if this is the case , then there are deeper problems in society , that will eventually need to be addressed . 
   plus the ` adventure ' has been highly successful so far , so there 's that . 
  way too early to tell . . 
  i 'm not surprised at all , that russians like putin as a leader , but it 's sort of surprising that they support the syrian adventure . 
  most ex-ussr people are wary of the middle-east .

   since other countries can tell themselves that they 're not doing any harm yes we are not harming ourselves . 
  that 's the way we like it . . 
   even if they pitched tents for them , handed every migrant a new down jacket and a portable kerosene heater , it would still be awful .

  the topic was about countries in or wanting to enter nato . 
  nice list of countries though , 10/10 would want to live there . . 
   germany had a pretty constant population of ~ 50,000 ordered to leave , well when was that ? 
  is it relevant to the current situation ? 
  this situation is escalating so fast , you ca n't possibly rely on business as usual . 
  you have to process these people asap , the longer you wait , the bigger the chance of conflict . 
  i think this situation is so overwhelming that you will accept people just to keep the line moving . . 
   oh they buy lots of advanced broomsticks - but do they budget to pay to keep them flying ? 
  they run on humanist values . . 
   well ; that 's a different problem . 
  yeah ... that 's a pretty big f *** ing problem . . 
  the deportation part is the biggest question mark in this whole fiasco imo . 
  it seems like it would be simpler to just accept everyone . 
  is any country actually been successful with deporting those who do n't qualify ? 
  i just ca n't see anyone going through with it , in an effective manner . . 
   royal with mehukatti was worse ugh ... that 's like the heroin of drinks . 
  mehukatti alone was poison . . 
   i think you are a little bit biased on this buddy . 
  yes actually experiencing the russian way of doing things makes you biased . 
  opinions based only on what you read on the internet are more trustworthy . . 
   really , so why do you think all these little countries around russia are so eager to enter nato if not for the bought politicians ? 
  because the local population hates russia , easy choice ... 
   but is not helpful , rational as a thought , these people could easily speak be the most assimilated but the only thing different is the dna . 
  if you seriously think the majority of the population will ever be '' rational '' , you are fooling yourself . 
  whatever rationality means to you . . depends a lot on your views in general .

  do n't think for a second that your country does not profit from us actions . 
  either directly or indirectly . . 
   please kick us out then , the thought of an american version of switzerland makes me rock hard . 
  lol that 's absolute nonsense . . 
   yep , i would prefer we left nato and concentrated on our own needs . 
  you do n't even understand how your own country works . 
  the reason that the us can paper over all it 's problems , is because of your military might and global presence . 
  it actually makes you richer as a country . 
  it ensures that your currency is the global reserve currency , that alone offers enormous benefits . 
  you ensure that your global business interests are secure . 
  you ensure that your allies can have have prosperous countries and for that you get some of their best and brightest as immigrants .

  number of deaths was ~ 3 days worth of traffic fatalities in russia . 
  it is a common propaganda misrepresentation that some russians like to post . 
  i.e soviet paradise under wise rule from moscow and the population skyrockets . 
  independent latvia at the hands of dumb aborigines and the population falls off the cliff . 
  it was a russian aggression , but the point here is that in the initial reporting the western media trusted russian lies . 
  cnn ticker said ' 4500 civilians killed by georgian government ' . 
   after recovery from communism we are aware of propaganda i refuse to believe you are actually serious here . 
  it is a lie that you know ` good russians ' must tell , right ? 
  http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/mh17-russian-missile-investigation_us_561faff3e4b0c5a1ce622a7b  a poll by independent russian firm the levada center that was released on july 30 , 2014 found that only 3 percent of russians believed that separatists in eastern ukraine shot down the jet . 
  this is in contrast to 36 percent saying it was the ukrainian military 's fault , and 46 percent saying a ukrainian anti-aircraft missile hit the plane . 
   while that poll was taken in the days immediately following the tragedy when information and analysis was still being released , another conducted a year after the disaster , in july 2015 , found near identical attitudes among the russians it surveyed . 
   still , only 3 percent of respondents believed that militias bore primary responsibility for shooting down the plane , though in the most recent poll 17 percent of people blamed the united states . 
  where do you get the 4 million and 2.6 million figures from ? 
  of course it was great . 
  soviet rulers targeted estonia with mass immigration to wipe out estonian nation . 
  then the immigrants left . 
  send 30 million ` refugees ' to germany next year and ask if the germans would be sad to see them leave . 
  for example in estonia almost all of it was recent immigrants from russia going back plus russian army leaving . 
  oh please . 
  all the western media was full of russian lies about `` 4500 civilians killed by georgia '' . 
  the western media bought russian early stage lies straight on . 
  that is some invented victim complex . 
  russia invades ukraine and suddenly it is `` b-but the west supposedly said something about chechens 25 years ago '' . 
  are we supposed to believe that in 2014 russians suddenly remembered this alleged tv insult of the 90s and that is why their approval of the eu went down from 63 % in 2013 to 31 % in 2015 ?

  the only use one could get from watching the rt is being very informed and analyzing how they lie . 
  that is beyond what one person can do on their leisure . 
  the sheer volume of work needs a team of specialists . 
  please !, 
  stop with the retardedness !, 
  you are seriously suggesting that in the internet age the conspiracy of the western media cabal would be able to block western people seeing putin 's speech ? 
  publicizing putin 's speech in short order is what is natural for rt as they are putin 's propaganda organ . 
  that speech is hardly something that would be kept secret without them anyway . 
  the second part of my reply was short because the whole of the second part of your long post was you not understanding the difference between ` bias ' and ` outright lying to meet objectives ' . 
   well , one excellent and recent example would be putins speech rt broke the news by being the first to publish putin 's speech !, 
  shocking !, 
   in this respect , i think rt sometimes serve as a good alternate view knowingly lying to further agenda is not `` presenting an alternative view '' and knowingly lying is what rt does . 
  something you can only sell to idiots for zero price is n't worth much . 
  i do believe it would . 
  i think there is often a desire to be ` modern ' and get to the press with these modern things and that desire might overrule common sense . 
  putting 10km/h self-driving minibuses on a road might just be one of these things . 
  useless , but gets reported widely in the world 's press so `` torilla tavataan '' . 
  you 're pretending not to understand ? 
  kremlin creates hundred conspiracy theories ... say about how ukraine shot down mh-17 because he thought putin was on it . 
  then it pushes it through their fake news outlets starting from blogs and reaching places like rt. 
  then the trolls of olgino spread the links everywhere so that the russian zombies believing this is what good russians must do would know what to replicate , claim and link . 
  there is no conspiracy in it . 
  it has been established . 
  what is rather unique is that russia has found their target group - dumb , weak-minded people willing to believe the most obvious of lies . 
  this russian law was about those born after february 1992 . 
  in my other post i took the statistics of those under 20 in 31th dec 2011 who were non-citizens . 
  it is a pretty close approximation and the number was 2475 . 
  the overall population in this age group is 267,530 so this 2475 makes ~ 0.9 % of them . 
  that is the number of persons with non-citizen status who were under 20 in 2011 census . 
  they can all get estonian citizenship by a paper signed by their parents when they are under 18 or signed by themselves after they reach 18 . 
  out of the 46880 non-estonians who were under 16 at 2011 there was 1285 with undetermined citizenship . 
  that is 2.7 % so it is very uncommon . 
  ( i could n't get under 20 year old for this statistics table as the age groups are segmented differently ) . 
  good job sherlock . 
  that was exactly what i was saying . 
  mi5 and gestapo are exactly the same . 
  solberg and hitler are exactly the same . 
  the former are just acceptable because it is * the uk * and * norway * doing it . 
  not everything is the same as every other similar thing . 
  prime minister erna solberg is not norwegian hitler equivalent . 
  mi5 is not the gestapo of the uk . 
  by 2011 census there was 2475 people affected by that . 
  it is pretty much nothing . 
  try to find articles describing what day to day work is like in these russian troll factories . 
  there is nothing like that in europe . 
  here is one estimation to the gdp-s before the soviet occupation . 
  a large reason for these troll factories is to make zombiecied idiots repeat their bullshit and control what bullshit is said at what times . 
  people are often incorrectly called paid trolls when in reality they are just idiots repeating the material given and doing it for free . 
  average speed 10 km/hour !, 
  because europe sucks . 
  stop buying russian bullshit in this . 
  just because russia is whining does n't mean it is hurt . 
  russia whines because he wants to invoke a natural feeling in spectators that ` truth is somewhere in the middle ' . 
  that is often true when dealing with normal everyday people and their everyday little conflicts , but absolutely not true in this case . 
  it has been even worse . 
  us military units participated in a military parade in moscow in 2010 . 
  can you imagine that !, 
  moscow is right in the polish back yard only some 700 miles from warsaw !, 
  you have super bowl flyovers . 
  what is ? 
  click on the link and scroll down to ` view comments ' link .

  if the 1 % you mentioned is basically helpless to stop it . 
  but i na scenario where it is smth like 20-30 % i can see it going to civil war easily . 
  i disagree , this is not how the real world works , think about a situation , where you know you are right , that `` make the calpihate great again . '', 
  propaganda , for example , is disastrous , but no words works and people keep joining . 
  and please also remember that you do not have an infinite amount of time to convince people that might fall for this propaganda to do otherwise . 
  this is not so black and white as `` to speak truth '' or `` to silence those you deem propagandists '' . 
  `` obvious ... propaganda . '', 
  no such thing as obvious , what is obvious to you is not 100 % obvious to anyone else . 
  everything is always up for debate , not matter what the law might say . 
  we could institute ultimate-everything-allowed freedom of speech tomorrow if no one who matters or has the power to stop this was against it . 
  and vice versa , we can ban certain topics tomorrow , if no one is powerful enough to stop this , and still have freedom of speech in every single topic toher than the ones banned . 
  it is not as easy as i see it being described in the comments both here and on r/ukpolitics . 
  i personally think there should be debates like the republican primaries in the us organized , every candidate gets to debate everyone else , if there are too many candidates , then divide the debating groups into two based on aggregated popularity ... 
  the most popular ones should be tested and be able to hold their views against even the least popular of the official candidates . 
  melenchon incoming to third place mr.fillon . 
  not that it matters much though , with a 10 % difference between the 2nd and 3rd places . 
  * bla-bla-bla * moderator : ow , look at that , x agrees with le pen on something !, 
  that always made me laugh :d, 
  he 's just `` being presidential '' i think, 
  what annoys me is that you can see the reaction of the audience . 
  imo there should n't be any audience at all . 
  dunno , i think it 's pretty good , at least i assume it 's a good translation . 
  do n't want to choose whether to go le pen or macron ? 
  respectively if theyare more to the right of fillon or more to the left of fillon . 
  fillon : 56 % ( -4 ) le pen : 44 % ( +4 ) but if fillon ever had a chance of getting to the 2nd round , this 56-44 would be pretty amazing for le pen , that would be getting close to those brexit/trump numbers . 
  plaid cymru warns of independence bid ... probably since like their party 's creation . 
  `` mr macron , who has praised chancellor angela merkel 's open-door refugee policy that `` saved our collective dignity '' , is promising to prioritise dealing with asylum requests within six months . 
  france should welcome refugees in need of `` protection '' , but `` other '' asylum seekers should be returned to their home country immediately , he says . '', 
  and if the asylum seekers refuse to go back home ? 
  and if they refuse to say where they came from ? 
  and if the country that is supposedly their home refuses to take them back ? 
  his plan looks good on paper , but i ca n't see how it is different from the present situation , since he 's not addressing any of the real problems that would stop him from implementing a view like that . 
  i never said merkel was a libertarian open border supporter , that 's your words . 
  i was actually talking about a lot of reddit users who support the idea . 
  he is n't talking about eu citizens , but basically mena countries . 
  `` asylum seekers '' not immigrants . 
  unless they are not asylum seekers , and then they are in fact immigrants . 
  at least he does n't say his son was a saint . 
  although he did n't specify who 's fault the drugs and cannabis was though . 
  in that the right-wing populist is right . 
  but some will stay pusue the libertarian open borders agenda simply because they believe it ` sin their interest and they do n't give a shit about the negative sides . 
  you are just repeating the same words , which mean nothing without context . 
  `` every party addresses questions on immigration , every party has its own nuanced view '' that 's ambigious as hell . 
  views like `` we should bring more refugees/immigrants because compassion/empathy/freedom , but we should check them better for criminals '' have proved to be at least partially fake and not meaning anything in particular . 
  not really , one other reaosn why some politician is called a populist is when he given promises he ca n't fulfill or as the wiki page says better than i can `` populism as demagogy , merely appearing to empathize with the public through rhetoric '' . 
  the latter fits rutte pretty well considering how he capitalized on the whole turkish scandal and how his party has become much more anti-immigrant in the last years . 
  whether he actually delivers on anything is doubtful at the moment . 
  wilders onthe platform addressing questions on immigration that other parties do n't want to even ask . 
  in what fashion it was done is another question , but if you and other just keep spewing the `` they are ignorant and they hate '' bullshit this will not help with anything at all . 
  oversimplification only gives more support to wilders and similar movements . 
  until the issues closely associated with immigration are dealth with this whole `` populism '' thing is n't going way for good . 
  your post was very informative , thank you , i will now never speak about american politics again !, 
  this is textbook hardcore political populism !, 
  all words , gestures and little action , although to be fair the us does n't seem to have the sort of problems that europe has with migrants, 
  that 's the same argument used against brexiteers - `` have a taste of your own medicine '' is basically what may is doing here . 
  especially since all intervetnion methods that would have been possible in the truly barbaric colonial past are off the table ... i really seen no good and efficient way out of this without causing causilities if we are to maintain the idea that people have the freedom to do whatever they like there , meaning if they wat to have 5-6 kids - fine , freedom . 
  but somehow once they ca n't feed them , provide opportunities for them it 's our problem . 
  `` at the moment there 's real discrimination with a sense of there being ` good refugees ' and ` bad migrants ' , and the africans are usually seen less deserving of international protection , '' africa has a birth rate that is too high , unsustainable . 
  hence the `` discrimination '' which is actually just a fact that helping each and every one of them without tackling the issue of high birth rate is very unsustainable . 
  gorbachev proclaimed after almost 70 years of experimenting with socialism that the soviet union needs more socialism for it to be more successful . 
  basically more of the same . 
  what happened with the soviet union shortly after ? 
  same here , europe sees a rise in right-wing populism , discontent over immigration , especially in eastern europe over the fact that the core eu countries have much more influence than they do and pull crap such as `` mandatory refugee quotas '' , over the clear fact that refugees do n't want to live in the more poorer countries like the baltics , while these countries have actually already spent money on preparing to take these refugees . 
  and then there is a politicians who says - let 's take more refugees , let 's have more eu . 
  more of the same . 
  in sports at least , the losing party analyzes why it lost , why the other won and proposes a new strategy , which should tackle the disadvantages it had before , possibly generating a new advantage for itself . 
  the same happens all the time in democracies . 
  yet i see no such thing from those who presumbly did n't vote for trump . 
  not all , but many if not most of them . 
  instead i see `` notmypresident '' , `` sorryaboutthemess '' and also `` democracy ai n't working well if the candidate i do n't like wins '' . 
  would be glad to see an explanation as to how these kind of posts , or actions like marches with a message like that , are going to convince those who voted for trump that they are wrong . 
  `` nobody complains about immigrants being on welfare in spain , because spanish government benefits are pretty scant . 
  unlike in the u.k. , for example , there is no housing benefit , child benefit or long-term unemployment benefit in spain . '', 
  actually a lot of people probably think the opposite , at least from my experience . 
  although spain is so close to africa that it is probably inevitable that migrants will come there just because of proximity and that spain is far more prosperous than any african country . 
  `` there is one tiny far-right party in spain . '', 
  that is false i believe , there are at least a few falanges out there for sure , remnants , reincarantions , remakes of the old movimiento nacional/falange . 
  we could ask turkey about this . 
  they are experts on nazis . 
  ( i know i know - erdogan bashing - very original ), 
  is cda a left-wing party though ? 
  the graphic seems to suggest so through the coloring of `` smaller left-wing parties ''  or am i reading too much into it ? 
  interesting , what party 's victory would he actually welcome though ? 
  also , who are the social democrats he is referring to ? 
  greenleft ? 
  the actual social democrats ie labour party got beaten harshly in this election . 
  just go to r/politics and post this in the comments over there . 
  see what replies you get and how `` obvious '' it is . 
  ( `` no , should have just voted for clinton , that 's it , you bernie bro !, 
  '' - type responses ), 
  you mean , until i agree with everything you say ? 
  i do n't see any arguments from you . 
  i actually wrote a small post with numbers . 
  it 's a quote from jesse klaver . 
  i assume it means being straight/honest about your principles . 
  where the hell did i imply that ? 
  please show me . 
  i suggest you improve your debating skills , 
  that 's at least two things  and each candidate is not one `` single thing '' for voters , just like you said `` there are a thousand different reasons why people voted for trump '' . 
  you basically ignored my point .

  you are too invested in your commie propaganda , too arrogant and too stubborn . 
  not worth my time trying to educate you here as you 're just going to ignore everything anyway and stick to your propaganda . 
  you 've just heard some bullshit soviet propaganda and believed it . 
  literacy rate of estonia was 91.2 % already in 1897 . 
  gdp per capita in 1938 was higher than in finland , austria or italy and 84 % of that of france . 
  quite different from what you incorrectly believed . 
  then we were invaded and occupied by a cruel backward totalitarian regime that started mass murders , mass deportations , [ practical reintroduction of serfdom ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/passport_system_in_the_soviet_union ) and overall backwardness and idiocy in economic matter throwing us into poverty and abysmal human rights situation . 
  i am not going to write more now because you showed how absolutely ignorant ( and a fair bit arrogant in that ) you were , so there are million things you do n't know , but if you want to ask something i 'll answer . 
   the post-staline ussr was honestly a ridiculous improvement over the medieval era in eastern europe medieval period lasted from the 5th to the 15th century . 
  why are you talking about that ? 
  if you think that ussr was an improvement over pre-occupation state in eastern europe then you are very wrong . 
  the arguments you make might be true for asian - stan countries , but that is quite different from europe . 
  because things like gas are never strictly business for moscow . 
  they are always dominated by politics . 
   it isnt that he is a weak person , rather is a nicer person and likes to avoid conflict . 
  that 's weak when it comes to the jobs like the president . 
  what page are the import prices of russian gas of different european countries ? 
  i looked through the whole gas section and did n't find any . 
  i think john r. schindler 's articles have a lot of interesting insights about that . 
  if you have n't still read it i 'd suggest you give it a peek . 
  he already had the money . 
  he already began a task force , but then just shut it down for some reason . 
  that propaganda worked so well because there was a lot of anti-american material and networks and with little twist the anti-american things could be turned to be anti-establishment and worked quite well for promoting trump . 
  a lot of things that could have been done and that even have been done by civilian volunteers like cataloging the facebook and twitter bot networks and the networks of misinformation sites . 
  would n't have worked anyway . 
  that and other articles by john r. schindler go quite into detail , but basically he blames obama for having a very lackluster response to russian propaganda and then even cancelling that . 
  that is of course because obama is a communist and hates freedom so for his whole life russian propaganda has been his ally . 
  he had n't noticed that this had changed and russia had picked a new horse to back in their effort to harm the free world . 
   that said , there 's no shortage of talent available to counter kremlin propaganda today , only a lack of bureaucratic will . 
  nearly a year ago , the state department created a counter-disinformation team , inside its bureau of international information programs , as a small , start-up effort to resist russian disinformation . 
  consisting of only a handful of staffers , it was supposed to expose the most laughable moscow lies about america and the west that are disseminated regularly via rt and other outlets . 
  they created a beta website and prepared to wage the struggle for truth online . 
   alas , their website never went live . 
  recently the state department shut down the tiny counter-disinformation team and any efforts by the obama administration to resist putin 's propaganda can now be considered dead before birth . 
  intelligence community sources tell me that it was closed out of a deep desire inside the white house `` not to upset the russians . '', 
  these are not the prices that russia charges . 
  these are the prices that the consumers in the country pay and they include all taxes and duties . 
  here is a bit old price information from 2013 , but it illustrates the picture rather well - https://www.rferl.org/a/gazprom-russia-gas-leverage-europe/25441983.html germany - $ 379 poland - $ 526 ukraine - $ 485, 
  building and maintaining a land based pipeline is cheaper than sea based no matter the transit fees , so that argument does n't hold . 
  people just put crosses there . 
  you do n't need a permit if the cross is smaller than something like 2 meters . 
  i saw a lot of crosses from visiting tourist groups . 
  something like a german motorcycle club putting a cross made from mufflers etc. . . 
  what do you mean ? 
  shows that obama should n't have been so weak and allow russian propaganda operations run rampart . 
  i am doing nothing wrong . 
  if a russian child got adopted to the usa he had 900 times lesser risk of dying before reaching adulthood than if he was left in russia . 
  horrible destabilizing things like wiping out tuberculosis or reduce child abandonment by giving support to the at-risk families . 
   to top it off the us is keen on `` making '' member states buy american arms that 's a conspiracy theory with no proofs . 
  i remember reading the statistics at the time of the adoption ban came . 
  the rate of russian orphans dying in russia as opposed to russian orphans in america was something crazy like 900 times larger so it obviously did n't have anything to do with child safety . 
  russia banned us persons from adopting orphans from their orphanages as a revenge for magnitsky act . 
  that is all this recently hot `` adoption talks '' is about . 
  putin was furious because as a mafia boss he must be seen able to protect his underlings and in the case of the magnitsky act he was n't able to . 
  that is why he took it out on russian orphans . 
  there are always freaks and idiots . 
  what empowered them was the hundreds of thousands of soviet soldiers standing at their back . 
  how meri justified it was saying that if not scaring the people with deportations they could have rebelled and then it would have been worse . 
  use google translate . 
  not airliners . 
  just a ship from nigeria to germany . 
  near germany the immigrants are put on water in rubber boats and then rescued and taken to a german harbor . 
  they paid good money to travel to germany . 
  preventing them reaching it is betraying their justified expectations . 
  why are n't the carriers bringing them to italy asked to return them ? 
  i mean they could use this brilliant legal trick of dipping them into water on rubber boats for few minutes . 
  why do n't the ngo ships just cut out all the middle-men and just pick up people from nigeria , bangladesh and wherever else they come from and take them directly to germany ? 
  that sounds like a breach  however , the swedish transport agency uploaded ibm 's entire database onto cloud servers , which covered details on every vehicle in the country , including police and military registrations , and individuals on witness protection programs . 
   ** the transport agency then emailed the entire database in messages to marketers that subscribe to it . 
  the westerners you find supporting russia like this are all some sort of idiots . 
  often the common strait is anti-americanism and that 's enough for them . 
  i have read quite a lot about the f-35 and know all the bullshit fud around it . 
  so when would britain be grounded ? 
  in 2070 , when it will need to retire their f-35s ? 
  meanwhile germany just ignored the need to replace their tornado 's . 
  you 're the one making excuses for soviet-nazi alliance , their joint invasion of europe and mass murders . 
  estonians defending their country after being invaded and massacred do n't need excuses . 
  you have gone full vatnik . 
  i seem to remember you were n't always like that . 
  i guess you 're an example of how current russian society breaks and molds people into jingoist totalitarianism apologists . 
  you are angry at `` west '' about some meaningless things and readily accept the russian pseudohistory and lies , that have been prepared for people like you . 
   playing soldiers a bit edgy statement , do n't you think . 
  what you were writing was the typical soviet era propaganda and it has many ways of reaching you . 
  you might have learned these `` facts '' ( that are not actually true ) from a bicycle enthusiast internet group with some far left loofy dudes pushing that view for example . 
  seems you have bought some russian propaganda . 
  in reality a lot of repressions were prevented because the soviets did n't have the resistance problem under control yet . 
  soviet union was a nazi collaborator . 
  they started the ww2 in alliance with the nazis . 
  it invaded estonia , latvia and lithuania in alliance with the nazis . 
  you calling estonians fighting against a foreign invader nazi collaborators shows how far into madness you have allowed yourself to be dragged . 
  butterflies and flowers have never stopped determined violence . 
  only defensive violence can stop the violence attacking you . 
  you being a female has nothing to do with it . 
  you conforming to the ( male chauvinism created ) stereotype of a brainless female who does not need to bother thinking about anything in the world and just talking about flowers and butterflies is the issue here . 
  you just refuse to think and enjoy playing a creature from other realm too alien to this world . 
  take a break from your heavenly nectar , smell an ukrainian flower and perhaps eat some ukrainian food . 
  maybe it will pull you closer to the reality on ukrainian ground ? 
  i am replying to your screenname here . 
  nothing to do with your particular message , but this is a response to all of your messages . 
  stop with your girly `` if only we had enough flowers to throw at their guns then everything would be solved '' bullshit .

  then your neighbour decides without consulting with you , to cut himself out from the grid , but this will cause you considerable losses , since now you have to build yourself a new grid as well . 
  obviously we 're going to pay russia for their connections with kaliningrad and that wo n't be cheap either . 
  it is very expensive and completely unnecessary political posturing . 
  it wo n't give any more independence from russia . 
  self-sufficient ? 
  catalonia would be bigger than a lot of perfectly functioning independent countries . 
  it 's not very popular , but it 's a known game and pretty ok in my opinion . 
  easy to understand , everyone can play ( regardless of physical abilities ) and makes you go outside , but is not exhausting . 
  perfect game for a quiet day . 
  well in a larger way it 's a desperate attempt at being relevant . 
  like the yesterdays `` news '' that the airplane used in the new bond movie was used in estonia by parachuters . 
  like what the fuck . 
  how does that have any meaningful impact on any of us ? 
  now , this attempt at being relevant is totally understandable . 
  estonia needs to have an identity , since without our identity there 's no reason for us to exist . 
  we need to make sure the world does not consider us a part of russia , since this would mean extinction for us . 
  and obviously we want to be good , rich and developed like the nordic countries and it 's good that we have some role-models . 
  but the nordic desire is very real , read some lennart meri 's writings for example . 
  it 's all about us being the real nordic country . 
  we really want into nordic , but ca n't . 
  this is a deep rooted insecurity issue . 
  i do n't necessarily agree with you . 
  what does showing intolerance mean ? 
  if a person does not like gays and he says it out loud ( to perhaps some gay people ) is it not his right ? 
  surely it 's not approporiate . 
  but the problem is more on the active discrimination/violence aspect . 
  being openly against something does n't mean i discriminate against it . 
  welcome all to the not black-and-white world !, 
   abkhazia and south ossetia are n't georgian territory anyway ; unless you support the work of joseph stalin . 
  other way around mate . 
  before staling they were integral part of georgia , not autonomous . 
  damn lazy welfare bums them finns . 
  i do n't see why . 
  a common system does n't mean you get a new migration policy ? 
  let 's say `` lita '' has some odd meanings in some languages as well . 
  best experience : best looking town ( old town ) in the world : worst experience : ate a little too much in \u0160vejk restaurant and felt a little dizzy afterwards . 
  the keys are a good symbol for any town , but riga has used these as symbols before . 
  would support that . 
  i mean it was not just expected , but pretty much certain it would happen . 
  reminds me when estonia was in international media in august 2001 for the same issue . 
  luckily 9/11 happened and everyone forgot that story . . 
  i mean east and west do technically kind of meet everywhere . 
  some towns in ida-virumaa are so empty that apartments are even given away with money . 
  logic behind it : if you own an apartment there , you still have to pay for some of the utilities ( heating mostly ) , so you 're better of paying someone to take your apartment than stick to it . 
  also some of these `` apartments '' are quite inhospitable . 
  when i heard estonia got bronze i assumed it 's a sort of `` everyone who 's not the best gets bronze , yay '' . 
  so i was right i guess ? 
  by trying to be regional powers ? 
  i mean poland is showing good strength , but obviously other ee countries do n't have that potential , do they ? 
  that is exactly what is supposed to not happen . 
  russian diplomats , spies , security officers all get training including getting wasted and not telling out stuff . 
  i 'm not sure about the method here , but estonia is about to go through a labour reform where people previously ( currently ) not counted as a part or workforce will soon become part of the workforce ( partially disabled people mostly ) meaning that the unemployment rate will go up to around 10 % . 
  no working clauses are used a lot , in public and private sector both . 
  it 's common sense you are n't allowed to leave for a competitor in the same field . 
  you think finnish women are smoking hot ? 
  i guess i must feel bad for sweden . 
  they lost , but hungary later retained way more autonomy from moscow than many other warsaw pact nations . 
  hungary had some forms of private entrepreneurship during the communist era that made hungary wealthier than other countries in the east . 
  at least that 's what is told here in estonia . 
  yes we could become energy importers like you guys . 
  but shipping energy production `` overseas '' wo n't be reducing the actual pollution , but only the place of pollution . 
  while i agree that the pollution it creates is a problem , it has gotten a lot better in the past few decades , estonia is sparsely populated allowing the environment to better cope with the pollution and also importantly the energy sector in estonia is actually a ) export capable and b ) only major employer in russian-inhabited north-eastern estonia where the disappearance of these jobs would greatly threaten our national security . 
  what green energy ? 
  as i said , there is no more on-shore wind potential , solar has a very limited potential , no hydropower potential . 
  only realistic renewables i see are off-shore windparks that are being developed , but they have their problems ( like an estimated price of 150 $ / mwh and most importantly not being a base-load plant , you ca n't just add infinite windpower to a network ) , and burning wood , which is being done as much as possible already . 
  both are huge importers of electricity . 
  lithuania is so low because their one huge nuclear power plant in ignalina was closed some years ago due to eu regulations . 
  that single plant basically produced 100-150 % of lithuania 's demand . 
  latvia ... just does n't produce electricity . 
  they have a hydro-electric plant on daugava river that pushes latvia to net exporter in the spring when water levels are high , but is otherwise dependant on imports . 
  realistically , what else is there to do ? 
  we have a lot of oil shale and the oil shale industry here has been since the beginning of 1900s . 
  we do n't have large rivers to harvest hydro power ( narva river hydropower plant is owned by russia ) . 
  our on-shore wind capacity is essentially full . 
  we do n't have the technical expertise or tradition on nuclear energy ( though many say , including me , that this is an area we should focus on ) . 
  we could burn gas , but it 's expensive as shit , besides it means dependancy on russian imports . 
  at least the situation is improving , there are a lot of new filters to catch the pollution , the production levels are much lower ( in 1980s estonia provided electricity for leningrad oblast , since the fall of ussr the electricity production has gone down more than a half ) . 
  several companies have increased oil , gas and chemical production from oil shale , making way less waste , being way more efficient and creating more value than simply burning oil shale . 
  one aspect is also that wood is being burned in these plants mixed with oil shale and coal , making it less carbon-negative . 
  ( we have a lot of trees here and re-forestation is only growing ) . 
  no it 's not . 
  words are just a means to convey ideas . 
  what makes the whole matter worse is how we interpret these words . 
  i can simply decide . . just like that , that asshole from now on means proud and courageous and it stops being an insult . 
  yes , if you say i 'm an asshole , you most likely intend it as an insult , but it makes you offensive , not the words . 
  neutral with reservations . 
  all this discussion about offensive words is ridiculous . 
  words are n't offensive , people can be offensive . 
  you can use nigger as an insult or you can use it in a completely neutral discourse . 
  now , i do think that some people ( not all ) who very insistently declare that neeger is not an offensive word , are the ones using it as an offence . 
  i feel good , that policies are made by fairly well-educated and informed politicians , rather than the masses . 
  ttip for example . 
  moldova is the poorest country in europe , on par with many african countries . 
  they have the unfortunate fate of being ripped apart by transnistria , a russian-speaking , russian-military hosting breakaway republic . 
  much of the industry was there . 
  also , moldova has been mostly governed by communist governments even after the fall of ussr , so reforms have not happened like in the more developed former soviet republics . 
  sometimes lose , always win . 
  ehh . . most of eastern europe has very very high home ownership - like 80-90 % high . 
  they actually kind of do . 
  how sure are you ?

   that 's the most voiced concern about direct democracy , actually - that people ca n't be trusted to govern themselves . 
  why not ? 
  because `` governing ourselves '' is a meaningless turn of phrase . 
  of course i trust people to govern themselves , in that i 'm confident that 99 % of adults are capable of making their own choices in how they lead their lives . 
  the primary job of a government is to allocate tax money into infrastructure and social programs , to enact and enforce laws , and maintain foreign relations . 
  i am not qualified to make most of those decisions , nor can i be expected to . 
  it 's impossible for one person to be well enough informed about these things to make competent decisions . 
  it takes an amazing amount of hubris to think that you 're any different . 
   the pirates are proposing an interesting concept called ` liquid ' or ` delegative democracy ' , in which , to put it shortly , you ` lend ' your vote to a person who you think knows enough of the subject at hand to ultimately decide in your favour . 
  how is that better than voting for a party that most closely matches your values and overall vision of progress ? 
  again , i do n't believe any one person ( even someone who spends all of their time on governance ) is qualified to make decisions in anything but a narrow field . 
  a competent party in a parliamentary system has experts in each field who make policy recommendations , and then parliamentary votes are cast along party and coalition lines . 
  why the everloving hell would i want to give every voter the power to veto these decisions on the fly ? 
  how are they qualified to do so ? 
  we vote every 4 years based on the cumulative outcome of a governments decisions , and that itself is a compromise . 
  4-5 years is too short for some long-term decisions to carry themselves out , but since a coalition is judged on the sum of their accomplishments , it 's generally enough time for us to make a somewhat informed decision on their overall performance . 
  most people agree that populism is bad . 
  why is it suddenly good when you empower it down to individual policy decisions and call it `` direct democracy '' ? 
  is it really that flattering to your ego to think of yourself as qualified to make decisions about monetary politics or infrastructure investments ? 
  there 's nothing wrong with those arguments . 
  democracy is anything but perfect . 
  it 's just that the alternatives are worse . 
  pure democracy is mob rule , or as franklin put it - two wolves and a lamb voting on what 's for supper . 
  that 's why we invented representative democracy and constitutions that guarantee rights which ca n't be violated by a simple majority vote . 
  we probably have a difference in values . 
  i do not think the government carrying out the will of the people is a virtue . 
  in fact i think the will of the people is just about the scariest motivation behind a body that has a monopoly on enforcing its rules with violence ( that 's what laws actually are ) . 
  what 's important is the * consent * of the people , and the ability of the people to vote out governments whose decisions do n't result in good outcomes . 
  the death penalty was abolished in most eu countries well before doing so was a majority opinion among the public in those countries . 
  please explain why that would have been a decision better made via referendum . 
  i will never vote for any party that advocates direct democracy . 
  i think the entire idea is ludicrous . 
  decisions should be made by experts , not laypeople with bees in their bonnets about something . 
  the point of democracy is to give consent to be governed , not to govern by the biggest possible committee of ill-informed knee-jerkers . 
  what i would support is requiring expertise and experience in the area that a government minister is put in charge of . 
  doctors in charge of healthcare , scientists in charge of science , etc. 
  no career politicians . 
  with direct democracy , no unpopular decisions could ever be taken , even if they 're extremely beneficial in the long term . 
  i trust my neighbors to be good at the one thing they 're good at , i do n't trust them ( or myself ) to decide over things they ( or i ) know nothing about . 
  we are not fucking western societies . 
  `` western '' is a codeword for `` post-colonial '' . 
  we are not responsible for your collective guilt . 
  yes , and then let 's tell everyone how dangerous not liking the beatles is , after all this one guy did n't like the beatles and ended up killing one of them . 
  if anything is radicalizing people , it 's your attitude . 
  if immigration was handled through a lens of sane discussion instead of the far left and far right screaming `` racist '' and `` blood polluter '' at one another , these psychos would find other outlets for their violent urges , and would n't result in this escalation of fear and indignation on all sides . 
  anecdotally though , things will be a lot better for them . 
  my grandmother is an ingerian finn who lived in estonia most of her life and went to finland in the 90s . 
  she spoke finnish her entire life because it was n't repressed here . 
  her children and grandchildren all speak fluent finnish . 
  i 've been bilingual as far back as i can remember - i spoke estonian with my maternal grandmother and finnish with my paternal one . 
  her sister lived in russia and her family was completely russian-speaking . 
  some of them did move to finland and learned the language , but when i was a kid i had second cousins who i could n't communicate with . 
  it 's probably easier to keep a minority language alive when it 's closely related to the majority language you 're surrounded by . 
  but i do n't think bringing in a few hundred udmurt speakers is going to result in a viable linguistic enclave . 
  keeping finnish alive in estonia is really easy because tallinn is basically south helsinki and there 's so much cultural content available . 
  most uralic languages seem doomed . 
  they 'd still get linguistically assimilated , just into estonian and finnish , instead of russian . 
  not by force , just by their low numbers . 
  there 's also that whole period where arabs and persians were centuries ahead of western europe on nearly every level . 
  i would n't outright eliminate the possibility that there 's some genetic link to personality/temperament , but if it exists , it 's subtle , and has nothing to do with why some cultures at some stages are failures . 
  personally , i have no desire to keep people of any ethnic background out of my country . 
  i only want to make sure that when we bring in new people , they do n't bring in a failed set of values with them . 
  come here and assimilate into our values , or go somewhere else . 
  i will not put up with veiling women in my country , ever . 
  as to your food and music and stories , they 're welcome . 
  god knows our own food is bland garbage . 
  let 's just be grateful that this idiot is n't even bothering to hide his phrenology-level racism . 
  i just wish there could be a sane middle ground between `` all the refugees are perfect angels , nothing bad will ever happen '' and `` arabs will pollute our pure blood '' . 
  and camp language , amirite ? 
   there is no multi-cultural dogma and cultures can coexist very easily , it 's radicalization that is a problem . 
  you 're literally parroting the dogma while saying it does n't exist . 
  this `` only radical islam is a problem '' meme is a complete falsehood . 
  yes , if the only concern with islam was terrorism , then anti-radicalization would be enough . 
  but it 's not the only concern , just the most dramatic symptom . 
  the problem is that completely mainstream , non-extremist islam is a very rigid value system that 's completely incompatible with modern western values like gender equality and freedom of speech . 
  mainstream islam is virulently misogynistic and xenophobic . 
  [ 60,000 girls ] ( http://www.equalitynow.org/fgm_uk ) have had their genitals ritually mutilated in the uk . 
  it was made illegal in 1985 but only one case has ever been brought to the courts and it did n't even result in a guilty verdict . 
  it was n't jihadi extremism that led to the mass rapes in cologne and elsewhere , but incompatible culture . 
  it may have been extremism that led to death sentence fatwas against salman rushdie , the stabbing of theo van gogh , and the charlie hebdo massacre , but the extremism is only in the severity of the response . 
  it is utterly mainstream and non-extreme for european muslims to believe that blasphemous speech should be severely punished . 
  they do n't quite think shooting up the offices of a satirical newspaper with ak-47s is called for , but they certainly want the authorities to shut the newspaper down and jail the blasphemers . 
  and these are n't just the archaic social mores of people a bit behind the times , these are the edicts of a totalitarian religious worldview that is the primary self-identity of them . 
  they 're not french arabs or berbers , they 're french muslims . 
  their cultural baggage is sacrosanct . 
  when non-muslims with backwards ideas voice their opinions , they 're widely criticized and ostracized from the debate by society . 
  when muslims do so , they 're given deference and respect for fear of seeming racist or exclusionary . 
  that is the multi-cultural dogma . 
  https://i.imgur.com/tzr5i61.png when 1/3 of muslims and 1/2 of muslims believe in death for apostasy and death for infidelity respectively , then it 's specious to claim that the problem is only with extremism . 
  that 's a different argument and it depends on entirely what the cultures in question are . 
  no , islamic theocracy is not compatible with french secularism and pluralism . 
  the annoying thing is that no one wants nuance , so you either have to parrot the multi-cultural dogma that all cultures can coexist , or you have to go full le pen and whine about every possible form of immigration because you 're really just a racist piece of shit . 
   because religious bullshit demonstrated my point . 
  though i understand that its inconvenient for you . 
  it 's not inconvenient , it 's just incomprehensible . 
  as the most irreligious society on the planet , i do n't really understand what religious identity even is . 
  i just know that it 's not a necessary part of ethnic identity , because we have the latter but not the former . 
   oh and the language - ours is effectively a different language since we ca n't understand nor pronounce the languages of classical greece . 
  well no shit your language changed over time , but it was n't displaced by a different one . 
  every greek from plato to you could talk to their grandchildren and be understood .

  then there is spring storm listed every year , that is an annual `` graduation trip '' for estonian conscripts , that should not be important enough to mention etc. . . 
  the circles do n't show where soldiers are stationed . 
  they show the rough area of exercise . 
  you can look up the number of participating troops from the table above . 
  if you click the link you 'll find a table that lists the exercises and numbers . 
  i think it was pretty good for finland to win this war . 
  i play along . 
  that is why there was finnish socialist shitty republic . 
  poor finland . 
  they won the winter war and missed out all this brotherly help of russian occupation unlike estonia . 
  i bet they are kicking themselves for that missed opportunity right now . 
  telescope names https://xkcd.com/1294/, 
  the view that i get is that eastern europeans do appreciate it , but many decades of safety have made western europeans not think about security at all . 
  i think that those who would take time to find out facts and think these things through would see how important america has been and is , but since the topic of safety is n't up they have just never thought about it . 
  that is such a southic thing to say . 
  that was the time when the main airport was temporarily closed for capital renovation and the little shed was used for that time . 
  you 're right . 
  for some reason i thought smaller numbers are further north . 
  i 'll have to change my statement to the northernmost point of denmark is as far north as the southernmost point of estonia . 
  you mean steal another flag , you flagstealers !, 
   no it 's not . 
  yes it is . 
  southernmost point of estonia is 57 \u00b0 30 \u2032 33 \u2033 n and northernmost point of denmark is 57 \u00b0 44 \u2032 n. 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_extreme_points_of_denmark https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/extreme_points_of_estonia also this http://i.imgur.com/urioj3l.png, 
  that is a recent and smaller thing . 
  there were plans for missile defense and bases earlier , but obama canceled them in 2009 as part of his ` reset button ' appeasement campaign . 
  denmark is southic anyway . 
  northernmost point of denmark is further south than southernmost point of estonia . 
  one of the first things obama did in office was cancelling the missile defense shield in poland . 
  poland probably feels obama is not trustworthy . 
  the blame to that is that your media got filled with shit about other countries . 
  in 2007 the top 3 enemy list was .

  greek government hired professionals from a private company and instructed them to come up with a way to cook their books . 
   why are russians hating ukrainians ? 
  intense propaganda in their state controlled tv . 
  only tv russia has . 
  kremlin finally realized they better not fight someone they ca n't win and erased estonia from their propaganda 's hated countries list . 
  i had the same misconception about putin . 
  `` was n't the political officer putin strangled by marko ramius when he stole the red october submarine ? 
  the map in op is about opinion of us leadership . 
  you tried to claim it is a map of pro/against nato . 
  op-s map shows 34 % of estonian people approve us leadership and my linked statistics showed that 72 % of estonian people approve being a nato member ( 19 % against 9 % do n't know ) . 
  you are trying to claim op-s map shows something that it does n't . 
  72 % of estonian people and 91 % of estonians support estonia being nato member . 
  nato has very high approval ratings . 
  obama 's foreign policy is seen as too weak . 
  usa invented debts . 
  7th in the enemy list with 19 % after latvia and lithuania . 
  people remember the nazis without keeping streets and squares decorated with statues honoring them . 
  i think a museum like this is necessary , but there are better things to put into museum as warning for future generations . 
  information about holodomor , mass deportations , forbidden literature , etc. . . of course these thousands and thousands of monuments could be piled up as rubble as some sort of art installation , but it has been done already plenty of times , would be ugly and it really would n't teach people very much . 
   it is n't unusual that serial entrepreneurs fail a few times before seeing any level of success . 
  that is the problem here . 
  after googling there are no results of success . 
  only failures . 
   i have a hard time picturing the belgian government actually giving a shit about what goes on in this part of brussels i do n't have a hard time picturing some grants given to nicely worded proposals that end up not delivering anything functional . 
  that ibrahim ouassari who dropped out of school at the age of 13 seems a bit like a fraud . 
  https://www.crunchbase.com/person/ibrahim-ouassari#/entity his first business - echoesys - does not even have a responding web page any more and the second - crowdfly - also seems non functional . 
  any success i can imagine is getting some government grants and spending it without delivering a functioning business . 
  so it is all right because he was jailed for internet argument where he was against russia invading ukraine . 
  got it . 
  math is weird . 
  having multiple suppliers competing with each other weirdly brings the prices down . 
  6 years is a long time if you are six . 
  it is not a long time in these kinds of things . 
  notice how ukraine possibly joining the eu after 30 years is a current issue now . 
  leave poland alone !, 
  article says 6 months and your post says 6 years . 
  there are also other important inaccuracies in your post . 
  please report yourself to penance for being a lying little shit . 
  whatever you posted does n't change the fact that this prominent ethnic russian latviaboy would be entitled to 10,000 years in prison and 12 hangings and you yourself would be in prison for the rest of your 6 natural lives if the law was applied by the letter . 
  so it was two things . 
  forwarding a picture of toothpaste and forwarding an article `` crimea is ukraine '' . 
  you have offended a group of me with your bullshit . 
  please report to necessary institutions and go directly to jail . 
  by applying the same standards you have already earned about 100 years in latvian prison just by the reddit posts by you that i have seen . 
  i googletranslated these two articles . 
  what they say is that there are two things russian court found him guilty of . 
  first is a picture of toothpaste and second is reposting and article `` crimea is ukraine '' .

  lets see what gorbachev has to say about it : http://www.brookings.edu/blogs/up-front/posts/2014/11/06-nato-no-promise-enlarge-gorbachev-pifer  the interviewer asked why gorbachev did not `` insist that the promises made to you [ gorbachev ] -- particularly u.s. secretary of state james baker 's promise that nato would not expand into the east -- be legally encoded ? '' gorbachev replied : `` the topic of ` nato expansion ' was not discussed at all , and it was n't brought up in those years .

  we would get very few days off if we excluded all the religious holidays that we do n't exactly follow anymore .

  considering i work very near to the center of the capital with lots of government buildings , plus youth groups that need to be checked from time to time , then i would say pretty often , more like once a day . 
   i can only speak for poland indeed , that was definitely not true here . 
  or do you mean social policies that are common to both left and right parties ? 
  because these are hardly leftist policies . 
  offering free plastic bags ( including the thin see-through ones ) will most likely be illegal by 2019 . 
  in estonia the only `` must-see '' sight is the [ tallinn old town ] ( https://www.google.ee/search?q=tallinn+old+town&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewix5sxlwabuahudfcwkhqu1ba8q_auicigb&amp;biw=2133&amp;bih=1082 ) . 
  plenty of other cool destinations , but nothing as unique . 
  thing is , it 's rather the american meanings of the ideologies `` socialist '' and `` liberal '' that are a bit skewed . 
  the rest of the world , especially good ol' europe seems to understand them differently . 
  socialism is a somewhat radical ideology , be it democratic or not - i.e. 
  it is n't part of the mainstream . 
  even the scandinavian mainstream socialist parties can rather be considered social democratic , not socialist per se . 
  as for liberalism , it is far more right-wing than in the us , ranging from center-left to mostly center-right . 
  that really is the case and that `` some countries '' is really just a couple . 
  actually palatalization in uralic languages is more ancient than in russian . 
  finnish has lost it , but its eastern dialects have regained it . 
  in estonian 4 consonants are sometimes palatalized : l -  l\u02b2 , n -  n\u02b2 , s -  s\u02b2 , and t -  t\u02b2 . 
  palatalization is not marked in any way ( i only used the ipa characters here ) and some words can be both palatalized and unpalatalized like * palk * ( `` log '' ) and * palk * ( `` wage '' ) and * sulg * ( `` feather '' ) and * sulg * ( `` bracket '' ) and you only get their nominative case difference through the context . 
  their declination into the other 13 grammatical cases is different though and they may lose the palatalization , as characterized by the three main cases : - * pal\u02b2k * , * pal\u02b2gi * , * pal\u02b2ki * - * palk * , * palga * , * palka * - * sul\u02b2g * , * sule * , * sul\u02b2ge * - * sulg * , * sulu * , * sulgu * easy peasy . 
   should be no issues with integration oh absolutely not , we iz very homogeneous . 
  in the city i do n't think it has happened in years . 
  in the countryside it happens more often , i 'd say once or twice per summer , probably just as often during the rest of the year . 
  it 's rather rare that absolutely no compromise is found , it 's rather that they can block progressive changes , but it 's still enough for the functioning of the state . 
  bernie would be a very left-wing member of our social democrats . 
  he would n't get very far by calling himself a socialist though , which he is n't anyway , but the word has far too many negative historical connotations . 
  it 's becoming more like a weekly question , but the answer is still finland . 
  we would probably manage with talsinki as the capital . 
  i think he was trying to pronounce the name in russian because the estonian pronunciation is [ much more domesticated ] ( https://youtu.be/njwi8abe28s?t=25s ) . 
  understood , but if you say * madalmaa * in estonian for example , then it could be any low land ( * madal maa * ) out there , even the land in your backyard next to the river . 
  and i presume it 's the same in many languages . 
  most racist people are not white supremacists per se i would say . 
  it 's rather that they find some obscure `` logical '' reason to dislike people they have almost no contact with anyway . 
  that was 700 years ago . 
  we have much more recent and much more gruesome occupation remnants to get rid of . 
  well , not * all * non-native speakers , 
  a former danish colony called `` danish town '' that is also the location for the legendary origin of the danish flag , uses same symbols as denmark . 
  no , nobody could have seen this coming , 
  some are particularly well-known , but they are n't nowhere as much used in sporting events etc. 
  some well-known examples include : - the [ flag ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tallinn#/media/file:flag_of_tallinn.svg ) and coat of arms of tallinn ( [ greater ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tallinn#/media/file:tallinn_greater_coatofarms.png ) and [ lesser ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/coat_of_arms_of_tallinn#/media/file:coat_of_arms_of_tallinn_\\ ( small \\ ) . svg ) ) ; - the coat of arms of [ harju county ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/harju_county#/media/file:et-harju_maakond-coa.svg ) ; - the flag of [ tartu ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tartu#/media/file:tartu_flag.svg ) ; - the coat of arms of [ saare county ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/saare_county#/media/file:saaremaa_vapp.svg ) . 
  flags of estonian regional ethnic groups are used in a more patriotic way though : - [ flag ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/v\u00f5ros#/media/file:v%c3%b5ro_lipp.png ) of v\u00f5ros , - [ flag ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/setos#/media/file:flag_of_setomaa.svg ) of setos . 
  i do n't need tricks for that , 
  or as latvians call estonia igaunija after an ancient county in southwestern estonia . 
  or as we call germany saksamaa after saxony . 
  we pronounce stockholm almost exactly the same way . 
  because only [ these two ] ( http://www.archimon.nl/general/holland.gif ) provinces are `` holland '' , the rest is not . 
  * madalmaad * ( `` lowlands '' ) is used in estonian as well , but you might get thrown stones at if you try to push this in common language . 
  perhaps you should n't have your country 's name in plural  but really - complicated names like the united states , united kingdom , netherlands tend to get simplified in whatever way possible , even though the us = / = america , the uk = / = great britain and the netherlands = / = holland . 
  sadly the [ uncle heino stereotype ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmejmx_mgqs ) is in sharp decline . 
  estonians pronounce tallinn as [ / \u02c8t\u0251l\u02b2\u02d1in\u02d1 / ] ( https://forvo.com/word/et/tallinn/#et ) , while the english / \u02c8t\u0251\u02d0l\u026an / and [ / \u02c8t\u00e6l\u026an / ] ( https://forvo.com/word/tallinn/#en ) both without l-palatalization are also fine . 
  yet from time to time someone says it [ in a weird way ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ttpq38lypu&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=48s ) . 
  i guess butchering is ok if it 's to make it sound natural in your language , but there is still a line how much you can butcher it before it sounds weird . 
   its neighbor estonia , however , i am genuinely not sure . 
  i used to think of it has eastern european , but they have gone to great pains to show their nordic heritage , and it does have strong scandinavian influences . 
  regardless of that , your whole presumption is still based on cold war era geopolitics , which is just weird as fuck more than 25 years after its end . 
  first foreign language in 2014 : 95.3 % english , 2.5 % german , 1.3 % french and 0.8 % russian . 
  ethnic russian schools teach estonian as the first foreign language of course , but it is n't counted in statistics as such . 
  in estonian language schools i imagine the share of people , who eventually learn each language is : 100 % english , 60 % russian , 30 % german , 30 % french . 
  it 's ** vikipeedia ** in standard estonian and ** vikipeedi\u00e4 ** in v\u00f5ro ( the most spoken southern estonian dialect ) . 
  if you 're in eastern europe , then so is lithuania , and vice versa . 
  op 's parameters for eastern europe were made contextually pretty clear in the post title . 
  petty political scandals , corruption allegations , and hopeless attempts at improving relations between estonians and russians without any room for compromise . 
  well , [ plenty of countries ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/unicameralism#/media/file:unibicameral_map.svg ) have unicameral parliaments . 
  definitely riga , i go there several times a year and i have plenty of friends in latvia . 
  helsinki is a strong second though , but riga has had a bigger impact as i 've lived in southern estonia for most of my adult life .

  and a quota system where say a country has 0,33 commissioner positions and can therefore nominate one minister every three terms .

  declension and conjugation are there for a relatively important reason - to better explain what you mean ... 
  i think we know a thing or two about alcohol tourism ourselves . 
  and in the same time we do n't really have prepositions and postpositions are n't always necessary . 
  you can say * laual * instead of * laua peal * , while the english `` on the table '' is somewhat longer . 
  declension is definitely not stupid . 
  it 's rather logical , only that it 's difficult to learn for non-natives . 
  and i 'm pretty sure english uses conjugation as well .

  why ? 
  the immigration of russians mostly into certain towns and districts is kind of common knowledge . 
  in 2011 , tallinn was 50.1 % ethnic estonian . 
  ( lots of finnish heritage population ), 
  that 's not really possible .

  these french and uk systems are so strange indeed . 
  how is it acceptable that 32 % votes gets you 75 % of the seats . 
  proportional system is the best because 32 % of votes gets you roughly 32 % of seats as it should be . 
  the important question is if he can lead them to the election victory and the answer to that question is no in my opinion . 
  eventhough labour did better than expected during the elections and media has made it look like conservatives suffered a huge defeat , let 's not forget that they will be ruling the country until the next elections , that are probably going to be held in the year 2022 . 
  to be fair 500 million does n't sound like much and if it makes eu one of the biggest defense reasearch investors in europe then it makes me wonder if anyone at all is investing in defense research at the moment . 
  eastern and central european defense industries could offer something if they got more funding as well . 
  poland for example has a defense industry but i am sure that france and germany would be more prefered . 
  i have a feeling that most of the funds will go to companies in western europe and everyone else has to buy from them in the future . 
  i hope that defense industries in eastern and central europe get funds as well . 
  in europe talk is more important than actions so make your conclusions . 
  i am not sure either but they have very strong conventional capabilites ( unrivaled in the world ) and they might use that . 
  you can spread them across the european union but they will still end up going to germany because there is a community there , not in eastern europe and central europe . 
  there was this article about refugees in estonia : http://time.com/4793913/finding-home-estonia-where-the-heart-is/ also yesterday another family left for germany . 
  i am not sure that france would use nuclear weapons to defend baltics should russia try to attack . 
  developing and buying are not the same thing . 
  they do n't want to buy together with this fund but share the development costs of new tech . 
  does n't seem like a big fund if it is going to reach just 1 billion by 2021 , considering that the same article says that developing of eurofighter did cost 20 billion . 
  my bad . 
  thought you meant planes for commercial airlines . 
  you do n't have to loan for that . 
  also poorer european countries already get eu funds for infrastructure projects . 
  also i am not sure that goverments are allowed to buy planes for companies because state aid is not allowed . 
  i agree . 
  in my country the goverment is attacked right now by media and opposition because they want to have 0.5 % budget deficit next year ( they have to change a law for this because budget deficit is not allowed right now ) . 
  i hope that they listen to criticism and have a even budget without deficit . 
  i do n't get the extreme media focus on handshake either . 
  seems like some kind of inferiority complex . 
  i wonder what the line of thinking must be - we might not be as powerful as usa but look at that god-almighty handshake - it 's so powerful . 
  to be honest everyone could see it coming and i tried to make this point as well . 
  when excisting rules are not properly implemented then it makes no sense to make news ones . 
  state aid is not allowed according to eu laws so you ca n't use it to develop industrial base . 
  this means that there is no use for debt . 
  these are not the best examples because the countries you mentioned rely heavily on finance . 
  for example united kingdom has the 2nd biggest financial industry in the world . 
  but everyone ca n't rely on finance . 
  there has to be a reason why germany , the european country with the strongest industry , has the strongest economy in europe . 
  also strong domestic industry helps to create a strong service sector . 
  we ca n't be service economies if we want to be wealthy - that was my point . 
  there is not a single rich country without strong industry or natural resources like oil and gas . 
  the only exception are financial centers . 
  the usually relax restrictions in sectors where local monopolies have been established and foreign competition ca n't succeed . 
  it is easy to say when prices start to rise we are just going to ramp up production but if steel companies are shutting down and factories are gone then you ca n't ramp up the production immediately . 
  you have to re-build the factories and train new people . 
  it is a good move for consumers ( short term ) but a bad move for european economy because it will destroy european industry - which is already happening . 
  economy based only on services is never going to be enough because not all countries can become financial centers . 
  i do n't even think that the steel is the real problem here . 
  the main problem seems to be the fact that it is very difficult for european countries to do business in china so opening our market for china is not a very good move . 
  kinda reminds me of our current prime minister when asked question . 
  he could probably talk over 1 hour about anything and when you think later , what he talked about , then the answer is absolutely nothing . 
  but they do n't protect free trade though . 
  they want free access to europe not the other way around . 
  differences on trade is the reason why eu and china could n't even make a joint statement about climate change . 
  eventhough i know that european military is in a bad shape , sometimes you still will be surprised by how bad things are . 
  it 's a bitter truth so this article is going to be downvoted a lot . 
  what post-ww2 sanctions ? 
  the same article says that during the peak of cold war germany had a tank force of 2125 leopard 2s - and this was just a western germany . 
  russia is a threat . 
  iraq was n't nato mission though . 
  hopefully latvia will recover soon . 
  i think that these sanctions , should there ever be any , would be catastrophe for european union because china is not going to sanction usa , india is not going to sanction usa , japan is not going to sanction usa , canada is not going to sanction usa or any other major economic power outside of the europe . 
  usa has a huge trade deficit with europe which means that europe would kill it 's export because it is more than sure that usa would respond to any extra tariffs against them . 
  i think that things would 've have to get a lot worse for researches to come to europe from usa because all the money and resources are there . 
  their universities spend so much more money . 
  trump is not going to be a president for ever . 
  even if he gets reelected then 2 terms is a limit . 
  they are our allies . 
  that 's the reason why it is important that all climate change deals include as many countries in the world as possible or at least the most industrialized ones because eventhough renewable energy is the future , the reality is that it is not competitive enough as of yet - otherwise everyone would have adopted it long time ago . 
  might be a troll though . 
  eu gdp is 16 trillion with uk . 
  made simple error . 
  13,8 trillion dollars is the eu gdp without uk and the defense budget would be 69 billion dollars . 
  russia spends around 60-70 billion dollars as well and that 's what i meant . 
  i just accidentally used million . 
  estonian gdp growth was 4.4 in the first quarter compared to last year . 
  check mate . 
  good to see baltic economies doing well . 
  if it would be only french and german co-operation then they obviously do n't have to invite anyone else but if they are laying foundations to common european security force that would in the future have to include all member states then they should invite others . 
  polls suggest that you can rely on usa but not germany . 
  usa is 75 % of nato so good enough . 
  we would only have to spend 0,5 % of gdp to be have the same army as now ??!??!?!?!?!?!, 
  this is extreme naivety and just wishful thinking - not a reality . 
  if eu ( without uk ) would spend 0.5 % gdp then our military budget would be 69 billion dollars ( ca 60 billion euros ) ... 
  so instead of 28 different armies we would only have 1 army that would be weaker than russias army . 
  huge superpower ... 
  i am not sure that 0,5 % of gdp would be enough to pay for soldiers wages . 
  edit : fixed millions to billions, 
  it seems like other countries are not even invited to discuss . 
  germany 's coal usage has remained consistent so not a lot of progress . 
  they decided to close nuclear power plants and substituted nuclear energy with coal - not a good move in my opinion . 
  i still have n't heard what laws are they breaking . 
  this is a legitimate question . 
  what law are they breaking ? 
  forget the european unity that was talked after trump 's visit . 
  europe is going to fight itself . 
  they would n't hire eastern european drivers anymore in that case because there would be no point . 
  earning little bit less vs no job . 
  easy decision . 
  not to mention that some supermarkets are expanding into eastern europe with the help of development funds . 
  seems like unfair advantage against local competition .

  it 's not like they suddenly become hetero and start hetero families with hetero children . 
  of course these people are too ignorant to comprehend that, 
  if latvia would fall under russian influence then the entire baltics would become destabilized . 
  i really really really hope this doesnt happen ... 
  there is no east european country that wants to be like russia ( besides belarus maybe ) . 
  the goverments constantly try to pass gay rights but the people will have none of it ... 
  then how can you explain the homophobic eastern european countries that also happen to be democratic and with open society ? 
  `` no.war is simply not the anwser '' warmonger : oh look , they dont want to spend any money on defense and would focus the money on something more useful . 
  this is an excellent time to invade !, 
  it hard to not hear of it when they brag about it all the time :d, 
  yeah , i suppose , but even with all those thing to take into consideration , id still expect there to be around 500-1000 russians who are pro-european and dont support the current goverment that use this sub reddit, 
  estonia big, 
  it is quite odd or sad that a country with 1.3 million people beats a country with over 100 million people :d ( too lazy to find the correct numbers ), 
  instead , you should either get a vault from vault-tech or escape to the moscow metro :d, 
  yes indeed , good that they are on our side, 
  we burn oil shale , and we get around 85 % of our energy from it plus renewables . 
  this makes us pretty much 100 % independent from russian energy . 
  maybe . . im not sure if we want it tho * glaring over the sea at nordics * ps : dont take that joke too seriously :d, 
  i 'm also lost ... 
  lies !, 
  our old town is beautiful . 
  you are just jealous , what do you you know ? 
  you dont even have potato !  :o, 
  bring us your money !, 
  tallink-silja wo n't be able to stop the eu commision if they push for it :p, 
  dont get too pessimistic . 
  it might actualy happen after rail baltica has been built , if we still are growing economicly and if our eastern friend does n't try something on us, 
  i agree , we might see this actualy happening in 20 or so years when rail baltica has been built, 
  hah , we culturally/historically are n't any more eastern than finland . 
  the main difference is that finland could resist the soviet union and we could n't , which lead to us being economically crippled and labled as `` easteners '' . 
  aww yissss , you 're da man !, 
  i already said , its a reference that no one will get here, 
  well you dont get the reference so you wo n't know and i cant explain to you ( but i do agree with you ), 
  60 - 100 year old grannies, 
  for the sake of not starting this argument again , yes , yes you did ... 
  come to estonia : the canada of europe . . and we made skype !, 
  please visit , we are poor ... 
  absolutely no one will get the reference on this subreddit ... 
  of course not . 
  not when more than 50 % of our population dont support gay rights which is sad . 
  however personally i see the parades as the complete opposite of what we need to achieve . 
  instead going on the streets , half naked , kissing and waving rainbow flags , maybe we should find other ways to promote gay rights . 
  instead of making ourselves look like inappropriate , uncivilized and different we should be making ourselves be accepted as normal people who can function in everyday life . 
  the parades are n't helping with that ... 
  3rd to last , actualy :d since in that case latvia and lithuania would also be considered northern europe ( from a geographic standpoint at least ) . 
  2nd best in eastern europe!best if you consider slovakia central european . 
  aww yeah :d, 
  so we need even more progress ? 
  great !, 
  hopefuly it helps to stop the russian media from sowing dissent in our russian minorities, 
  or maybe the homophobes/idiots/racist are the most vocal and largest group of commentators on these sites, 
  yeah , lately i have been trying to get rid of the habit of viewing the comments after i 've read the articles, 
  seeing the comments on postimees or delfi make me sick as a pro-gay rights person . 
  not to mention there are still racists in our country . . 
  u mad bro ? 
  of course they dont . 
  why would they want to tell the children that they made a pact with the facists ? 
  isnt it romantic ? 
  i 'd love to be a part of the glorious ii swedish empire . 
  estonia can finally into nordic then !!, 
  can we join too ? 
  i personally am not aware that people put mayonnaise on pizza here in estonia . 
  but then again i dont know about poland or other baltic states since we have quite different cultures . 
  went to italy this year and the pizzas and pastas were fucking amazing . 
  i cant belive i ate the crap that they call `` pizza '' here . 
  good idea, 
  exactly, 
  too bad all estonians ( not counting russians ) that are still religious are protestant , 
  speaking from experience , huh ? 
  well we used to have more than you . . 1-2 years ago . 
  we have had quite a big drop this year . 
  hopefully it bounces back next year . 
  ( as it showed on the forecast of next year ), 
  at least estonia has almost no public debt , so we have that going for ourselves , which is nice . 
  now if we could just lend these helicopters that obama is bringing here during his visit ... http://imgur.com/t6jfuqq, 
  ekre also seems to have an interest in digging phosphorus , which is the second big no-no for me besides the racist and homophobic views . 
  yet laaneots said in a recent debate that they have no plans to change anything in the conscriptions . 
  you are correct and i ca n't belive i forgot that part . 
  ( but if i remember correctly , the president said that the winning party 's pm canditate will get to form the goverment ? ) . 
  in my defence they still may still `` win '' by getting most votes out of all the parties but the title is still misleading and i wish i could change it . 
  yup . 
  every other party is pro-western and eu at least to some extent . 
  i ca n't give a source right now , but surveys have shown that +70 % of centre party 's voters are estonian russians . 
  the second biggest party in terms of russian voter base is the social democrats with 13 % . 
  for some reason the link makes it subscribtion only . 
  just put the article 's title `` estonia readies for general election , parties focus on security , economy '' into google and it should give you the entire article . 
  a little bit less competition for us i supposed  ( punk/heavy metal almost never does well in esc ), 
  i 'd say this years song is definently one of the better ones we have sent . 
  but of course it 's all subjective and many people do n't like it . 
  whilst on the subject of eurovision , it seems that we have the most liked entry next to italy . 
  people are hyping it up a lot . 
  let 's just say that we win . 
  where would we even get the money to host such an event ? 
  we barely managed to host it in 2001 and how are we ( and any other small country ) supposed to do it now with far more expensive equipment ? 
  the true winner would have been the netherlands if it were n't for conchita 's gimmick . 
  note how it says in the title that they `` may represent '' . 
  the final will be tonight . 
  i honestly doubt that it will win . 
  why not ? 
  i never thought i 'd see this day .

there are 450k readers on r/europe and they are rarely more than 5000 + upvotes on the top posts , it seems most do n't even participate in this , this is hardly even 1 % of the readers and you use that as statistics . 
  you 're so ambigious , branding opinions as '' / europeans conspiracy theories '' , let 's get some concrete examples of the so called `` conspiracy '' opinion : 1 ) `` immigration/refugee intake has a limit '' 2 ) `` immigrants/refugees must not enforce their cultural values on others - no sharia law , no mandatory special islamic clothing for women , etc '' 3 ) `` immigrants/refugees must not be leeching on welfare of the most successful countries of europe '' 4 ) `` refugess must stay in the first safe country they reach and not go shouting `` we want germany/sweden '' , because that is the sign of an economic migrant '' none of these popular opinions on this sub have anything to do with ultranationalism and/or racism . 
  yet you brand them as `` conspiracy theories '' . 
  that is mighty ignorant . 
  `` i see what comments gets upvotes and downvotes . '', 
  that 's no proof , that 's just you bias . 
  give me statistics , but you probably do n't have any , because there are n't any . 
  you probably ca n't acknowledge that people are concerned about the issues and have shifted towards anti-immigration views or have drifted from pro-immigration arguments so much that the far-right do n't sound insane anymore , but more reasonable . 
  `` sane thoughtful comments '' is a biased term to used . 
  what is sane to you might seem absolutely insane to others . 
  this is so ignorant how you assume `` most '' get their worldview from european or whiterights , where 's your proof for the `` most '' part , i wonder ? 
  `` so do latvians , finns and other nationalities living here , yet they do n't get preferential treatment . '', 
  they are under 1 % or less of finns and latvians , there is no preferential treatment of them because there are so few of them . 
  if there were like  5 % of them , they would be more visible in all aspects , financial/political included . 
  but there is no such thing . 
  excuse me , but as far as i 've seen rt is seen as a less credible source here , judging by the top comments . 
  also the favourite argument here is that rt is `` state-controlled '' , while fox news is privately owned , thus impartial or more impartial . 
  even though it supports the agenda of one political party only , which , at times , is in power in the us . 
  yeah . 
  but technically not `` state-controlled '' !, 
  `` why would we fund that with our own money ? '', 
  because , you know , russians pay taxes too . 
  i 'm talking a bit theoretically here , but in a discussion where some moderator allows only arguments to be exchanged it does n't matter how many people hold any view . 
  also , `` uniformed opinions '' can be countered by arguments , if the people with these opinions can not say anything meaningful in response then they 're `` out of the game '' anyway . 
  this is quite true on internet discussions , where some people either stop posting when they realize they have nothing to counter with or start a verbal abuse challenge instead , effectively acknowledging they have nothing meaningful to say , 
  a proper discussion involves making proper arguments , if the specialists know their area of expertise , they 'll have no problem answering whatever comes their way with proper arguments . 
  exactly this . 
  because you get labeled a nazi as soon as you say that you favor that , because `` socialism '' + `` anti-immigration '' is `` nationa-socialism '' to many . 
  it 's bullshit . 
  i 've read `` tweets '' . 
  [ ] yesland ( iceland ) , [ x ] norway , [ ] denmark not perfect , but here it is :d, 
  yes , they will all take that lightly and will not resist that at all . 
  what does temporary residency mean - what happens when it expires ? 
   we can still resettle them in syria . 
  this is insane , many of the refugees do n't even want to stay in hungary and you want to resettle them in syria . 
  surely every one of them will just say `` ah , okay , if you say so '' and go back or will not resist if it is forced . 
  firs the west intervenes , fucks shit up and then refuses to repair what they fucked up . 
  google what i said , look at who 's talking like that - that 's your former secretary of state . 
  yes it was , as the simplest , most simple example - google `` hillary clinton gaddafi death reaction '' - do n't pretend the us did n't support the arab spring . 
  `` you ca n't have redistribution of wealth without some kind of democracy and free speech . '', 
  no , democracy is often used as a very ambiguous word when it comes to matters of wealth and it 's redistribution . 
  wealth redistribution usually happens either through violent means , either a bloody revolution where part of the `` elite '' is stripped from power and their assets distributed , or from some form of rapid economic development or political revolution , where part of the `` elite '' is weakened or goes bankrupt and again - their assets get distributed among the winners . 
  democracy may only play some part in the second way of doing things , but the prerequisite is that there are groups that can actually out compete the `` elite '' in economics or can win an election while simultaneously not being closely associated with the present `` elite '' . 
  i 've written a bit too much of text , yes , but my general point is that democracy has prerequisites , and as the word hints , if these are not available , then there can be no real change . 
  it 's not primarily about democracy , this is about distribution of wealth and power among the different parts of the society . 
  you ca n't build a western democracy where there is a very small group of people who control everything while nearly everyone else have to think about how to survive the next month . 
  it is so much different in the west for most people , at least today . 
  this is an ongoing crisis in europe and many people are concerned . 
  please give your `` material goods '' to all the robbers of the world then , if you truly think so yourself . 
  make it easier for them . 
  hey sorry man , thought you were coming after me in your post , he he :d, 
  perhaps , i interpreted his `` as for the others '' as meaning `` as for the other points you made '' , 
  i 'll have to read some articles on the presidential election then , thanks !, 
  what the hell ? 
  i have n't been a dick to you , so you can go fuck yourself for blaming me for something i have n't said . 
  and second , if you could n't spot it , then read through my post again , i 've written that chp is not `` oh-so-great '' , i actually criticized it 's failures in the past , specifically to address the problems of the more non-secular groups of the country . 
  yeah , that 's why i 'm not sure , i do n't really know much about mhp , but i know that nationalist parties tend to have more left-leaning economic policies , while being on the right on pretty much every other policy . 
  then again if chp is more secular and mhp is less right now , then it 'd be difficult to mix them . 
  first of all chp was n't the ruling power for the last 80 years , there were different parties , coups , etc. 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/coalition_governments_in_turkey second , parties tend to become more corrupt the longer they are in power , they also tend to make `` mistakes '' in terms of defending interests of different group in the country , i guess chp made those `` mistakes '' as i 've read somewhere . 
  what matters though is the situation now . 
  same question here , how hostile are mhp and akp are to each pther and how cooperative mhp and chp can be ? 
  final thoughts . 
  my approximation is akp gets 39 % , chp gets 30 % , mhp gets 17 % , hdp gets 10 % . 
  so would this mean that by your approximation there could be a big change in government after this election ? 
  ca n't mhp and akp form a coalition ? 
  how hostile are they to each other ? 
  they are not suitable for the local market to be teachers for example , or doctors , you have to know the local language well enough for that . 
  and they just do n't . 
  and there 's probably very few of those who actually have these skills in the first place . 
  that 's not going to happen , they will riot , they will demand `` open the border '' like they already do , they will do all sorts of hunger strikes , will refuse the food and water that they will be given . 
  and what do you do then ? 
  will the government have balls to quell these riots like they should and deport those who started them ? 
  i do n't believe that . 
  `` this is a european problem , not swedish , german or austrian . '', 
  it 's a german and swedish problem mostly , since they were so eager to bring the refugees in ( while criticizing those who behaved differently ) and now one of them is actively pushing for these quotas and fines . 
  `` slovakia used to host refugees from chechnya and yugoslavia in the 90s and nobody was objecting back then . '', 
  did slovakia have a western european-level welfare in the 90s ? 
  how much of the chechen and yugoslav refugees were actually chechen and yugoslav refugees and not , say , african ? 
  or russian , other ? 
  that 's not the mention the cultural norms of these peoples , did they respect the local traditions and norms or did they say that apostates should be killed , no wome n't rights , etc ? 
  what i 'm saying is that they are not comparable at all , these two waves of refugees . 
  `` were n't these laws known before ? '', 
  so it 's ok as long as you are warned about it then ? 
  great . 
  `` if there are official ways or unofficial tricks , people will use them . 
  you would . '', 
  ah yes , the old `` if you could break the law and get away with it - you would have done it '' . 
  1 ) that 's the mindset of criminals . 
  2 ) we have no moral obligations to those who do n't want to play ( sometimes even openly ) by the rules and follow the law . 
  they deserve all the negative attitude and consequences that might get . 
  i agree , we should help them , but no redistribtuion of refugees between countries . 
  the refugees should stay in camps in greece , financed by the eu , or be trasnfeered to some other place , if the safe zone in syria ever gets implemented . 
  what is this `` compromise '' here that you speak of ? 
  did the countries agree on the fines as a compromise , if not then why are they `` suing the eu '' ? 
  does n't sound like a compromise to me . 
  the treaty was n't written for a crisis like we have , it worked only until the number of people and the amount of problems with them was below some point . 
  and we are past that point , the treaty must be changed to reflect the new reality . 
  individual countries and their leaders do n't have the balls to admit the scope of the migrant crisis , are willing to criticize those that do something , then do it themselves ( hungary , austria ) . 
  and you want a more closer union of these very different `` styles '' of leadership .

  it is not a single dude who has gotten his hands on the money , the money comes from many sources . 
  several families ( and families in those countries can get big ) , even a whole village , might pitch in to send a guy to europe . 
  the real refugees do n't have the money to travel to europe , the fact that they have 10k to spend , even on several families is huge in such dirt poor countries . 
  that money is better spent locally anyway than giving to smugglers . 
   easy to trace where that money came from , is it ? 
  i 'm saying that the fact that they even got that amount of money together means that they 're not living in mud huts in the middle of nowhere without electricity . 
  it means they probably come from a rather civilized place , which means there are bound to be records of them . 
  language test , records , etc. 
  if they had enough money to shell out 10k eur for a boat trip here , there 's probably some trace of them you can access , they 're not coming from mud huts from the middle of nowhere . 
  does the pro-immigration circlejerk at the guardian ever stop ? 
  what ethical implications ? 
  it 's very cost efficient , since the number of economic immigrants trying to get to eu will drop greatly . 
  indefinitely detaining people is only a violation of human rights if it 's done without a trial , form courts that deal with refugees , give them trials and it would be perfectly legal . 
   even if legal , detaining somebody indefinitely is quite a deplorable act . 
  they choose to be detained indefinitely , because they refuse to identify themselves . 
  a country should n't be forced to accept a person who could be anyone , a warlord from uganda or w/e else . 
  if they 're unwilling to identify themselves that already means they will likely not qualify for refugee status and they know it . 
  that 's a very rare situation in reality . 
  and how does that violate the rights of illegal immigrants under current human rights laws ? 
  i 've always wondered if you live in your own fantasy world , this settles it . 
  why ? 
  how does it violate human rights ? 
  do tell me why not , then ? 
  nobody is forcing them to live there , they made the choice of hiding their identity . 
  they 're criminals for all intents and purposes , making an illegal border crossing and should be treated as such . 
  eu should direct more funds for spain to make better camps , but the point remains . 
  you wo n't say where you 're from , we will never let you leave the refugee camp , pretty fair in my opinion . 
  the conditions should be made better , but yes , those same camps . 
   we ca n't send them back if we do n't know where they come from . 
  easy , if they wo n't say where they come from and ca n't prove it to a reasonable degree , they 're never leaving the refugee camp . 
  problem solved . 
  why not ? 
  well it makes sense you support it , since all the opposition comes from people feeling like the us will benefit while eu wo n't . 
  i mean what can you really expect , if the charlie hebdo killers shout out `` allah akbar '' while committing mass murder , i doubt french people would get different treatment when bombing mosques in saudi arabia and yelling `` viva la france ! '' . 
  that said , i do n't condone this behavior , but it 's hardly surprising . 
  hawk is n't a penis either . 
  damn finns , `` fish '' is not penis . 
  polan can into kebab ? 
  these are the world 's least religious countries , out of the 65 we surveyed *, 
  that 's not an unpopular opinion , that 's just being an asshole . 
  new and exciting denmark !, 
  too expensive and too prone to fail , breathalyzers need calibrating too often , imagine one day trying to get to work and this thing shows you a false positive ... 
  turkey , kappa . 
  well to be honest , while i see that the stories posted on reddit are in no way representative of the entire us police force , there clearly is a huge problem in us , you do n't have to be a teenager or a redditor to notice that . 
  both sides seem kinda jerks about it , i do n't really have an opinion either way . 
  hungary pls . 
  it 's a start , 10 million is better than nothing . 
  austerity is still way better than no austerity . 
  just look at greece , while finland 's economy might not be growing right now , at least they are n't in serious debt , nor is there huge unemployment . 
  ireland had austerity , they 're doing great , estonia had austerity , doing great , uk had austerity , doing great etc. 
  i ca n't see how you can pin this on austerity . 
  what break-up ? 
  all those pro-immigration articles by guardian are getting tiring , i used to consider them an unbiased newspaper , but this is getting ridiculous . 
  there are plenty of countries in africa they could 've escaped to where there 's no war and that are n't filled with `` infidels '' , they only choose europe because of the economic opportunities . 
  maybe if we double our * gdp per capita one more time . 
  i think the case is that estonia had more room to try doing things differently , since we had a clean slate . 
  some of those things turned out to be very successful , so it 's no surprise nordic governments want to implement some of those things as well . 
  this does n't mean estonia is the best and most developed society in the world . 
   estonia is n't the best and most developed society in the world ( i 've been there ) who says this ? 
  who believes this ? 
  i think the hype for estonia is more in the order of what estonia has become in a short time since gaining independence , being happy that a country which came from nothing has made such leaps forward . 
  which should give hope that other countries might be able to pull this off also , that it 's not that only countries who have been stable independent democracies for a very long time can be successful . 
  that 's not an unpopular opinion in europe , usa maybe , not europe . 
  the article has been updated , when i commented they were still unsure of the details . 
  which you can tell looking at the time of my comment and the `` 50 minutes ago '' on the top of the article . 
  it 's hard to protect every single ship , considering the sheer number . 
  once they have hostages , there 's not a lot these `` pirate hunters '' can do . 
  i think all ships that sail in those dangerous areas should have the capabilities to protect themselves . 
  why are n't these ships allowed to arm themselves ? 
  in estonia . 
  was n't us much lower last year ? 
  do n't worry , estonia will come help when things get bad \\ ^ \\ ^ . 
  where the fuck is bestonia ? 
  i think we would 've aced this . 
  the tunnel , of course !, 
  you picked a poor time to post though , it 's 03:00 -05:00 in europe currently , most everyone is at sleep . 
  canada is a honorary member of europe !, 
  stop buying oil from russia . 
  i 've even heard about that , but i doubt that 's the case here , or it would n't have become such big news in the first place and estonia does n't have much of a problem with corruption . 
  unless they seriously increased their efforts , you could probably extrapolate that data to all illegal immigrants . 
  new and exciting spain !, 
  that 's awesome !, 
  why ? 
  there were big talks like a year or two back in estonia about this very thing . 
  microsoft decided that estonia is rich enough to pay them a ton more money for microsoft licenses ( microsoft sells windows cheaper to poorer countries ) . 
  so there was a big debate on if we should switch to linux instead , a lot of people were pro and against , citing reasons such as that it 's hard to train older government employees to learn linux and all specialized software was done to run on windows machines , but it died down . 
  i guess we decided to pay microsoft after all . 
  i 'm kinda sad , would 've been great if we made the switch . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ oh ^ ^ ^ ^ wait , ^ ^ ^ ^ i 'm ^ ^ ^ ^ not ^ ^ ^ ^ flemish . 
  i highly doubt finland will ever get as bad as greece . 
  yeah , but i meant more in the lines of that you had 50 years to do stuff with sweden , while estonia was pretty much dead in regional politics . 
  still means a lot to us that we were n't dead in your hearts !, 
  oh , so the entire africa is unsafe , i guess we should just bring their entire population here then . 
   we 're sending everyone back who does n't have a valid reason for asylum . 
  it 's not like there 's a ` free for all ' immigration scheme . 
  are we really ? 
  aww \\ ^ \\ ^ , i thought you guys would say sweden . 
  seeing as bestonia was dead for 50 years . 
  an alternative such as migrating to countries nearby , instead of taking the dangerous boat trip to europe ? 
   it 's not even a ` reward ' .

  we already have common fiscal policy but everyone ignores it . 
  we ca n't even commit to 3 % budget deficit and 60 % debt of gdp limits . 
  edit : i know that now 60 % debt of gdp is almost impossible to achieve but the point of is to show that even when we set some limits then they will be still ignored in the future . 
  how can i be sure that if eurozone adops new fiscal policy that everyone wo n't ignore it after 5 years . 
  it means that both of the possible next chancellors of germany are against eurobonds so this means that there will be no eurobonds . 
  i like that . 
  sorry , i forgot that eastern european countries had no right to say anything . 
  i think that merkel can resist anyone and as long as necessary . 
  i have lost all my faith in the so called `` proper fiscal unification of the eurozone '' because there are too many countries that do n't care about 3 % budget deficit and 60 % of gdp debt limits . 
  i would n't force germany so much because it is starting to look like blackmailing in my opinion . 
  forcing germany too much might break the current eu but it might not be bad after all . 
  maybe northern european countries can make some kind of a trade and economic union with germany in that case - because northern european countries tend to have same views as germany when it comes to economic and fiscal policies . 
  if there is common debt for the future then i want out of eurozone . 
  i do n't want my country to suffer because of irresponsible loaning and budget deficits in the future . 
  i hope that referendums will be held on membership of eurozone when such proposals are made because collective debt is huge topic and goverments should ask people if they are okay with this . 
  it 's my opinion and nobody has to agree with it because everyone has right to their own opinion . 
  of course centertism does n't mean utopia but it is a lot better than any ideology that has far attached to it . 
  i think that labour parties are to blame for what has happened in the past few years because instead of representing working class they started to make fun of them and ridicule them ( making fun of people because of their education is something that is popular even in this subreddit ) . 
  because they wo n't represent them anymore then obviously working class has turned to far right parties that usually tend have very socialist economic policies . 
  i do n't think that anybody cries about labour parties losing votes anymore . 
  i also like that both far left and far right were beaten . 
  i was worried that they might elect far left canditate and eventhough some people in this sub tried to convince that far left is n't as bad as far right but i was n't buying it . 
  good result in my opinion and by larger margin than i expected . 
  obviously these precentages will change as votes are counted but it does n't really matter anymore because he is not going to lose it . 
  i was looking at that figure but i was just saying that french does n't have 78 million native speakers in europe . 
  france has 66 million people living there and millions of them do n't even speak french natively . 
  i know that there are native speakers in belgium and switzerland as well but are there really this many ? 
  because according to studies italian and english are ahead of french as well when it comes to number of native speakrs . 
  according to that wikipedia graph french has quite a bit less than 78 million native speakers in europe so that 's the huge part of the difference as well . 
  many people speak german natively outside of germany as well . 
  for example in austria . 
  english is the easiest of the 3 for sure . 
  i think that i could never pronounce french right so i wo n't be even able to speak it . 
  does anyone else besides native french speakes use french ? 
  i think that everyone else is using english . 
  they could learn but as of now german has the most speakers so if we have to switch now then german would be better choice . 
  according to wikipedia table the advantage to german is like 30 million native speakers right now . 
  but to be honest i would support english as the main language of the eu . 
  edit : also germany is the most powerful country in europe so that has to count something as well ? 
  i do n't think that they would . 
  german is popular language in poland for example . 
  for history french is obviously more important but if we talk about modern day europe and how juncker says that english is fading then the next most logical choice should be german . 
  after all , in addition to german having most native speakers in european union , germany is the most powerful country in europe . 
  i 'm more than sure that we would be worse off without austerity right now . 
  only person that did n't belive that austerity worked in estonia was krugman so there was even one sided twitter war between estonian president and krugman . 
  austerity might have even made crisis worse in the very short term ( because it would 've been more convenient to loan money instead of cutting spending ) but in the long term it was the right decision . 
  i do n't think that this is coincidence that estonia was if not the quickest then one of the qucikest countries to recover from crisis . 
  estonia has had budget surplus ever since so deficit spending was n't important for us . 
  but the goverment that we have had since the end of 2016 wants to change the law to allow deficits up to 0.5 % ( budget deficit is not allowed by law ) but i hope that this does n't happen because it will go only on populistic spending and benefits eventhough they claim it goes for investments ( noone belives them ) . 
  they want popularity for elections . 
  anyone knows why french is regarded as second most important language in europe not german ? 
  german is the most spoken first language ( native speakers ) in europe . 
  works for me . 
  it might be possible that i am biased as well because for example in estonia and latvia goverments imposed harsh austerity as soon as the crisis started which cut wages and goverment spending a lot . 
  also there were tax increases on people too . 
  but it worked out well for us and now our countries have recovered and are doing well . 
  i think that with austerity there is no middle ground - you do it or not - and in my opinion many countries that are struggling right now were initally too hesitant and wanted to make it gradually or spend their way out of it unsuccessfully . 
  public sectors jobs are usually jobs that do n't generate economic growth but just cost money because public sector offers mostly services instead of things that create nice profit . 
  meanwhile private sector is the opposite because they have to create additional value to make money so i would bank only on private sector to get the economy going . 
  i think that nordic and baltic countries will do exactly as germany says so i think that even 2/3 majority is impossible to achieve . 
  my personal opinion is that eu should change it 's economic models as well but in the different direction : i think that less deficit should be allowed . 
  the fighting part ( who gets factories ) is something that i would be afraid of as well because it could lead to many projects being cancelled . 
  only countries that have problems and had to take austerity measures for extended periods were ones that had problem with high debt in the first place . 
  had n't they had high debt then there would n't have been nearly as big problems as there were . 
  i mean deficits and goverment debt just ca n't keep rising for ever because it will make economy crash at one point . 
  edit : i am also sceptical about deficits getting the economy going part because france has currently 3.4 % budget deficit and 0.3 % economic growth so the money just disappears while debts will remain . 
  even 2/3 wo n't be enough because germany is not alone but usually most of the eastern and northern eu members think alike . 
  creating businesses and jobs that improve economy is something that private sector has to do not public sector/goverment . 
  to be honest blaming the eu is the politicians nr 1 go-to move in almost all countries when something goes wrong . 
  the main reason that european defense industry is behind us industry is money . 
  i belive that scientist in europe are not inferior to those that work in usa eventhough usa attracts lots of talent from around the world but the main difference is that in usa there is money and resources . 
  i am more than sure that europe could 've made it 's own 5th generation fighter plane project but probably it would 've been killed by parliaments for being too expensive . 
  i mean look how much backlash f-35 got in usa for it 's costs and usa is a country that has traditionally spent big money on military . 
  f-35  eurofighter . 
  i mean f-35b is much better plane for aircraft carriers because eurofighter ca n't even land on one . 
  completely remove american dependency ? 
  good luck with that because it is not going to happen any time soon . 
  if europe starts to spend collectively nearly as much as usa does then perhaps it is even possible to somewhat close the gap between us and european arms industries but meanwhile not a chance . 
  also what i do n't like is that the main talking point of these european military projects is saving costs which means that we will have a cheap military that has saving costs written all over it . 
  what european militaries need is money and all these military projects is just a distraction to fool voters who belive in these things . 
  i mean if european countries without uk spend at most like 150 billion compared to over 600 billion that usa spends then you have a problem . 
  before anyone says that saving costs means that we can buy more then ( that is little bit true ) it wo n't help much when it comes to r&d which is extremely expensive when it comes to modern military technologies . 
  also as some poeple have mentioned here uk leaving takes away a lot of know-how that other european countries do n't have right now so at first it sets european projects even further back . 
  look how expensive it is to develop f-35 . 
  i do n't think that italy has the capabilities and resources to develop such plane . 
  they can build planes so they are going to do exactly that - build . 
  it 's hard to tell but i think that euro has been generally good for estonia . 
  it has boosted trade with other countries and from my own point of view it just has made life more convenient when traveling to finland for example because i do n't have to convert currencies anymore . 
  i do n't know how euro could 've had impact on unemployment or factories closing because it 's just a currency . 
  maybe these factories were going to be closed anyways . 
  latvia adopted euro in 2014 and since then nothing bad has happened and latvian economy is doing very well right now ( almost 4 % growth ) . 
  i also remember some news that euro had big impact on consumer behavior and people started to look prices more than they did previously so maybe this is something that has had an effect on how people view euro . 
  i live in a rural area myself but not far from a bigger town . 
  but people moving to towns is something that has been happening since the 19th century here ( continued during the soviet times ) so nothing out of ordinary to be honest . 
  economic situation is a lot lot better than it was during the soviet union . 
  there is even no point of debating it because it 's a fact . 
  obviously facts ca n't fight with emotions and nostalgia . 
  in my country about 67 % of people support eu and it 's basically the same as it was when we joined the eu . 
  single market , schengen area , euro are things that people generally like because they make lives better and more convenient . 
  my parents and grandparents do n't even want to hear anything about soviet times and they definitely do n't want these times back .

  good news for us for sure . 
  she will kill herself in much more unpleasant fashion for everyone , including her close ones , how is that a better situation ? 
  yes , you are very busy . 
  and i should say that hate is very vague notion , especially when speaking about a politician . 
  people say they hate bush or putin or le pen , that does n't mean they go through the emotion , i 'd say it usually means they are critical towards their applied policies or worldview . 
  in estonia for instance we do n't have good beef ( maybe very small producers who are rather expensive ) so the steaks are pretty hard to make . 
  and the main reason for shitty beef , i believe , is the climate . 
  i lived in australia for a while and they have great beef thanks to the fact that cows can live out all year . 
  here we have to keep them inside half of the time and that fucks up the meet . 
  pork on the other hand is great here . 
  better than in . 
  i guess we learned how to raise them inside after centuries of long winters . 
  putin hate is the only sensible thing in my view . 
  he is running the country after all ( people hated bush even more , although he was less responsible for wars than putin ) . 
  plus , if you 'd live next to russia like me and get pretty outlandish news every week ( this weeks it 's `` russia reconsidering baltics independence legitimacy '' ) you would n't have that philosophical attitude . 
  incidentally i 'm planning to move soon to further to the west or us too . 
  i will join your `` chill guys , media works '' camp after that . 
  i usually do n't downvote , but you seem like and asshole . 
  putin mentioned that there 's no such state as ukraine . 
  on official level there are no legal issues too , alas . 
  well , thats true . 
  well said . 
  no , its because they 've seen few hollywood romantic comedies and mr.bean where the guards are some stoic statues and protagonist does funny things to them . 
  blame tv . 
  i think you are 5 years late with your `` witty '' comment . 
  i just do n't get it how some random people all over europe get so emotional and attack greece like its one person who stole something from them personally . 
  all that 0 sympathy and shit . 
  what is this ? 
  some kind of medieval public execution instinct ? 
  and yeah , europe is really poor , really struggling , lets not help one of our ** members ** , lets just randomly hate everyone in greece . 
  i just do n't get it whats going on lately , so much shit going on and all at once . 
  everyone kind of hates everyone and news and articles are full of weird sensationalist bs . 
  everyone writes total crap about immigration , muslims , greece , ukraine vs. russia bla bla . 
  europe is divided like an orange into 10 pieces . 
  every little shitty nation in europe is thinking small , only about themselves , unable to see us one union . 
  maybe we should go back settle things in good old wars , what a great time that was . 
  0 sympathy , really ? 
  cmon guys , this blame game is so useless . 
  i do n't get the animosity towards whole nation . 
  there are some useless politicians and bunch of asshole bankers on both sides . 
  the whole situation is such a complex clusterfuck , greeks have two very bad choices and ez has only bad choices . 
  greetings from estonia guys !, 
  criminal got away unpunished . 
  how is that related to islam ? 
  problems in sweden justice system seem to me self-inflicted . 
  being pc to an extreme and being afraid of labeled racist is local problem , nobody forced that on swedes . 
  rich people logic . 
  i think i was in 3rd grade when i found out that appearances matter and good looking people are treated better , and i think in about 4th grade when i got over it and moved on . 
  edit : and the irony is that this guy is most probably better off than the bus drivers , the fact that he wastes precious time to create this rather obvious video . 
  yeah , lets bash the bus drivers , the elite of our society . 
  the fact that christianity right now is peaceful says to me that violence arises from something other than religion . 
  religion is perhaps exploited or used as a vehicle , but we can replace it with almost any ideology and get the same result . 
  communism for instance is almost a reborn christianity with their internationalism and empathy bullshit - yet eliminating a class of people was n't an issue . 
  and again , i 'm being a almost devils advocate here , as i personally view any mass ideology , be it nationalism or some religion somewhat ludicrous . 
  well , lets say for now i 'm just one of the guys who are on the right side when it comes to immigration ( i 'm pro immigration in general , but i think europe should start thinking how to lessen the numbers ) . 
  and my reason is right in the topic we are speaking about . 
  the hate will just grow and i 'm worried that one day europe ca n't handle the issue in civilized manner . 
  the further in time we push the solution the worse methods will be used . 
  far-right is rising and will keep rising if present power is unable to deal with the issue . 
  and even if in many ways i 'm politically on the right side of the spectrum , there 's nothing more i despise than ultra-nationalists and far-righters - the shit color of the spectrum . 
  so would most of the polish youth support shooting gays ? 
  point is that this title is bit over the board . 
  i would add that its not even the religion , its the merging of `` modernity '' with `` less modern '' . 
  different cultures squeezed together in smaller and smaller world will create tension . 
  look at big migrations in history . 
  you do n't have to have very different religion to invoke terrorism and violence . 
  there are plenty of examples where christians fought each other , not even so long ago . 
  and i 'm saying all this being actually for stricter migration laws in europe . 
  i 'm just against irrational hate that is rising against muslims . 
  yes , there are criminals and nutheads ( and we should go after them ) , but lets keep ourselves from generalizing every terrorist act on a billion people . 
  many have said who experienced the war that it brings out the worst in humans but also that you see most unselfish acts during these times . 
  i guess this is a great example of amazing human beings putting their lives ahead of others . 
  and i hope media focuses more on this side of news too . 
  this muslim bashing has gone to some idiotic extent in here and in europe in general . 
  usually this means the `` unwanted '' state is inevitable . 
  turkey can try suppress kurdish state but it can have opposite effect in a long term ( similar to russias endeavors in ukraine ) . 
   the point is that it really does n't seem that your country wants to accept the number proportionally with the rest . 
  actually we do . 
  i do n't know where you get your info , but most politicians are for the solidarity with eu and accepting fair amount of refugees . 
  the only problem was with very much nonproportional number . 
  by the way . 
  ironically i think hungary is the one who is against any refugees . 
  but hungary is also ally of putin in europe . 
  fun fact about eastern europe . 
  proposed quota for estonia was around 1000 refugees . 
  but our actual proportion for population in europe is supposed to be 150 refugees ( not counting our lower gdp ) . 
  we are willing to accept the number proportionally with the rest , but punishing us with more refugees than for instance germany is ridiculous . 
  and my opinion is that its deliberate political move by eu commission to fail the quotas from the start , leave and impression something is done but pesky east is blocking it , so eu does not have to deal with the issue , just postpone it . 
  so , you are saying its nice wheather ? 
  modern evolution , less bright people voluntarily decide to stop passing on their genes . 
  there are plenty of authoritarian regimes where leader has been popular . 
  castro for instance . 
  control over media , killing critics , jounralists and oppressing opposition makes russia authoritarian . 
  if you look at dictatorships , pretty much all of them have high ratings of their leader . 
  you think kim has 89 ? 
  do n't be a naive , pretty certainly he has 100 % . 
  replaced oligarchs with authoritarian regime . 
  defending russians in ukraine ? 
  thats rich . 
  that was not an argument , i 'm pointing out hypocrisy .

  just because something is n't apparent on how it hurts someone that does n't mean it is n't affecting them . 
  a knee injury can mean a person does n't get work and that often leads to fun things like depression and similar . 
  it 's particularly interesting here , because things like obesity are often linked to issues with self-control that can easily stem from a mental illness.i feel that there 's this idea going around that everybody is the same , but some people just try harder and that 's why they can control themselves fine . 
  essentially `` why ca n't you do that ? 
  i can so it fine ! '', 
  seems a bit odd since we seem to be a lot more understanding of this when we 're dealing with physical aspects of a person or even about that person thinking . 
  a smart person would be very rude if they went to a dumb person and then just exclaimed `` why ca n't you do this ? 
  this is so easy for me ! '', 
  smoking is also self-inflicted . 
  as is anything stemming from alcohol or any kind of trauma that happened during recreational activities like snowboarding . 
  it might be more efficient for an average consumer but the consumers in that specific location need work to actually live . 
  we see urbanization in a country - young people moving into bigger cities . 
  on an international scale like in the eu we see brain drain and similar situations . 
  free trade agreements facilitate these kinds of things . 
  does that happen though ? 
  i understand that it can increase competition in areas there was little competition in originally , but does n't it also cause quite a few problems like certain local industries being unable to function ? 
  the leverage here is probably a point of morality . 
  something along the lines of `` oh but you were here and you really wanted this , but now you 're leaving and having us pay for it '' . 
  imagine you 're sharing a flat with 3 other people . 
  you are lacking a washing machine and you guys decide to put your money together and get one . 
  you ca n't afford it though so you go with paying monthly installments . 
  you sordidly argue that the group ships get the washing master 3000 that 's more expensive . 
  then you get into an argument with the other guys and decide to leave the flat . 
  you also stop paying your share of the installments for the washing machine and the other 3 have to pay for it . 
  if this scenario is framed in the right way it could be considered as some leverage of public opinion . 
  of course somebody would have to find projects the uk pushed for that were expensive etc. 
  well , you could consider it in some way good for `` competition '' between countries . 
  big countries with a good economy tend to appeal more for companies , so they get disproportionately many companies . 
  this leaves other countries in a worse off position . 
  however , going down the road of < 1 % effective tax rate is insane . 
  there 's no way that 's good for anybody in the long run . 
  like what ? 
  honest question , i 'd love an answer . 
  and who bears the cost of all of this ? 
  the states , right ? 
  maybe not . 
  i think facebook might be useful since i do youtubes and having facebook would help slightly spread the word , but i just ca n't keep track of all the things i already use well enough . 
  kind of difficult to come through the north of finland by sea : http://i.imgur.com/4yb5cjy.png, 
  just to be pedantic : finland does n't have a northern coast . 
  let 's build a wall and have the refugees pay for it . 
  nope . 
  of course you have a loss of data and businesses suffering . 
  i bet this would be the case if almost any email provide also went out of business and suddenly stopped . 
  in google 's case they just do more than that . 
  the internet will get * disrupted * of course because we do n't get to use the services we 've relied upon , but it does n't necessarily break some critical piece of infrastructure that ca n't be replaced ( except maybe youtube , i believe that if youtube goes away with google we will never get a service as good ever again . 
  either it will have more ads or more restrictions or something similar to that . ), 
  the op of this chain * was * talking about it as though they did n't deserve it . 
  i do n't use facebook at all . 
  yes , i know . 
  of course things would break if google 's services disappeared over night . 
  but the topic at hand was google as in the search engine and its news section . 
  the fonts , ad services and tracking are n't necessarily linked tightly with links to the news organizations . 
  what i just mean is that google is n't * that * critical as this guy made it out to be . 
  linux server distributions and similar are a much more critical part of the infrastructure yet there 's little talk about how critical those parts are . 
  also , i do n't use facebook at all . 
  i use plenty of google services but that 's because i make youtube videos nowadays . 
  i think that for an average person it would n't be very difficult to avoid google services if they wanted . 
  the problem is that you probably do n't want to since what they offer just tends to be good compared to the competition . 
  what will happen to the internet then that it wo n't be fine ? 
  people wo n't get to their gmail ? 
  no youtube ? 
  a bunch of other services do n't work . 
  however , the internet is fine . 
  things not related to google ( the majority of the internet ) would work just fine . 
  also , what ? 
  nobody * handed out * shit to google . 
  they built the services and people came . 
  if your transparent democratic service can make a better one then i 'm sure that people would use it - it would be just as good but also transparent . 
  problem is , what you 're going to make , likely is not going to be as good or better . 
  that internet infrastructure is something * everybody * gets to use . 
  it is n't in some way special in the case of google . 
  so if you want to claim that their success is not their own but built on that then why not go a step further and talk about how somebody inventing pcs is also relevant to google 's success , as is electricity etc. 
  they 're not the gatekeepers of the internet though . 
  you can go choose to use whatever other services you please . 
  bing works fine as an alternative if you 're not interested in as relevant search results . 
  if google disappears the internet will still keep working fine . 
  right now it 's just your one stop shop . 
  and if your argument is that google ca n't stay the way it is because that 's the one everybody uses , then my question is : what about wikipedia ? 
  are we going to force wikipedia to also change because of the same reason ? 
  charge money from wikipedia on the information they reference , right ? 
  because wikipedia is so damn well off they have all this money to throw around . 
  what about facebook then ? 
  are we going to claim facebook is also a monopoly etc etc. 
  maybe even do a double slam on google since they also have youtube ( you know , the place that for many many years literally lost google money ) . 
  well , there 's always hope for the council . 
  except in google 's case they 're the ones that built the road with their own effort . 
  and there are other `` roads '' too , people just do n't want to use them since they 're inferior . 
  i feel like this makes sense . 
   one man 's trash is another man 's treasure . 
  the important thing that we have to keep an eye on , though , is to try to not keep them in this circle of poverty . 
  edit : oh , i understand now . 
  i am sorry . 
  you 're right !, 
  same . 
  seeing that helicopter take off was my first time seeing a helicopter closer than in the sky . 
  http://www.eurotunnelgroup.com/uk/eurotunnel-group/operations/traffic-figures/ it 's more like 10 million passengers and 20 million tons of cargo ( about 10 million passenger equivalent ) . 
  are you saying that your city is n't a castle ? 
  considering how close estonians and finnish are , it might not be as good of an experiment though . 
  i ca n't speak a lick of finnish but if you speak finnish to me you can probably get your meaning across to me because the two languages are just that similar . 
  i do n't think finland even has a * northern * coast .

  most countries do n't even recognize their actual crimes under international law ... 
  very few european nations do that anyway . 
  plus europe is a peninsula of eurasia . 
  there is a hate for the british here ? 
  the worst of all is that they do n't get it themselves . 
  kosovo deserves independence from serbia . 
  most sovereign states recognize it too . 
  what do you mean by already ? 
  they claim to have annexed it in 2014 ? 
  why suck up to a hostile imperialist dictator ? 
  it 's not that bad , the tourists mostly buy the tanks and artillery weapons from local ukrainian supermarkets . 
  it 's [ fennoscandia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fennoscandia ) , not scandinavia !, 
  there is snow outside tallinn ?? 
  weed is illegal in my country . 
  are you inciting me to commit a crime ? 
  who let 9 year olds to reddit ? 
  perhaps it was a shitty joke in my opinion ? 
  jokes are supposed to be relevant to the subject in hand , that 's when they get funny . 
  most of our time is spent on arguing whether latvians have six toes or five with three in the front and two in the back . 
  please start to train every fraction of the population to hype . 
  he said hot , not burning . 
  you do n't have to drive that far for that , so you can do it in most of northern europe , 
  trucks do n't kill people , people with trucks kill people !, 
  no , there are many negative aspects about estonia , plus i can take/make jokes about estonia as well . 
  this was just random blabbering . 
  oh come on , this subreddit can not be filled with so many edgy teens , can it ? 
  boo-hoo energy independence  green energy  you wo n't become nordic with that how is that related ? 
  you 've got to fight trucks with trucks . 
  plus adding together geographically detached regions is not the point of this hype train . 
  1984 was about totalitarian dictatorships like the soviet union . 
  the us and the uk are democratic countries ... 
   the turkish federation of belgium hmm , i do n't know of this country . 
   i personally feel europe would be better off under russian rule . 
  wtf ... 
  a great quote from doctor zhivago about russians applies here : `` even comrade lenin underestimated [ ... ] our cursed capacity for suffering . '', 
  there are plenty of reasons to call it the `` russian empire vol . 
  that 's a common theme in russian propaganda . 
  and basically wherever russian soldiers have stepped is forever rightfully theirs as well . 
  depends on where you live - you would be * de facto * alienated by the society if you actually missed the soviet union here . 
  please do n't start another hype train with every fraction of population . 
  in that case nobody in europe is against russian culture , we just despise their hostile imperialist dictatorship and historical lies . 
  there was a reason for that . 
  whooh , i 'm not eastern european then . 
  or is this about estonians being slow ? 
  because i doubt this is a known joke throughout the entire eastern europe . 
  because it works . 
  going radical with it is what we should be worried about . 
  lol , nice brainwash, 
  these were justified though . 
  why sarcasm ? 
  it was a quick way to get rid of a dictatorship . 
  i wish there were more invasions like grenada . 
  i 've done vodka shots with a minister at a very casual pub . 
  what is n't being cracked down upon in china ? 
  i am an anti-theist , what is so toxic about me ? 
  i know more about religions [ in general ] than most religious people for sure . 
   and often feel superior to others because of their views . 
  i do feel superiority over people i consider less intelligent than me , what 's so wrong with that ? 
  these people are less intelligent for believing in an imaginary creature that has never had any shred of evidence for any sane person to believe it for . 
  the most important thing is that there are quite many western youths believing it simply because they think their own media is biased and everything coming from anti-western news ( especially russia ) is correct . 
   in 20 years time the progressive nations of western europe will be islamic regimes . 
  and we have an oracle . 
   belief in god fell in favor of faith in the state was replaced by the official ideology of communism , which was close to being [ as stupid as ] religion . 
  it 's not like many people actually had this faith in communism , it was a forced-upon ideology ... 
  arabic christians use the word `` allah '' as well , they even say `` allahu akbar '' . 
  how can you `` actively '' not believe in god ? 
  how is life going in the socialist czechoslovakia ? 
  the shittiest way though . 
  latvia is sending in their tank as well , so be prepared !, 
  i do n't see the difference . 
  but crimea is an illegally occupied ukrainian territory , not part of russia . 
   russians in the baltics are more likely to support our independence than do biding of putin that 's a very bold exaggeration . 
   a lot of manufacturing jobs are moving east . 
  and they will be moving out of here in no time - at least we had them here for a while instead of leaving europe sooner . 
   combined with corruption and bureaucracy . 
  ** a lot ** smaller issue in central europe and the baltics than it used to be . 
   can we give back the parts of finland & the baltics lost to the ussr oh god , not this shit again ... 
  \\ #unrelated, 
  imagine a time when our own descendants start to think naively positively about the soviet union . 
  i mean , could you even fathom the idea of that ? 
  that would be one exceptionally distanced capital from the rest of the country . 
  most likely west from ingria , but whatever ... 
  reddit could be among the last of our favourites , but there are still more estonians here per capita , 
  sure , of course such competition rules only exist when they have too big of a control of the market . 
  yeah , but that argument does n't really convince me . 
  quick !, 
  lets ban any polish space initiatives and then invite them back !, 
  if they are two different companies , is n't it illegal to divide the market like this ? 
   talin is pronounced exactly the same as tallinn . 
  in what context ? 
  in estonian it would be : - tallinn [ \u02c8t\u0251l\u02b2\u02d1in\u02d1 ] - tallin [ \u02c8t\u0251l\u02b2\u02d1in ] - talinn [ \u02c8t\u0251\u02c8lin\u02d1 ] - talin [ \u02c8t\u0251lin ] they all sound quite different with the latter sounding too short/quick for a common name . 
  because history is filled with `` crimes '' and it 's rather pointless to argue about them ? 
  the key word here is international law , which got its modern meaning only in the very end of the 19th century . 
   that 's not s oh touch\u00e9 . 
   tallin which is just an incorrect soviet era transliteration from russian ... 
   talin which is just an incorrect soviet era transliteration from russian ... 
  in estonian it 's tallinn and the one l and n forms were used in russian , which occupied estonia for half a century . 
  it 's rather a compliment usually when a serbian or a russian does n't agree with me . 
  technically you are irreligious . 
  to generalize , this can mean that you are either an atheist or agnostic .

  russia made a wrong turn to be attractive . 
  they have a great working example how to be attractive literally next to them - europe . 
  but they went back to failed method - soviet regime . 
  even if they get the support from western europe there is n't going to be any trust from eastern part for couple of decades . 
   there is nothing good or bad but thinking makes it so . 
  is that how pro-russians think about nazi germany ? 
   i have been to homogenous countries like poland and slovakia , and they are so much better than the uk . 
  i lived in australia for several years , and i enjoyed the mix of races and cultures a lot . 
  and being back in homogenous eastern europe feels rather boring . 
  i guess its a matter of taste . 
  i understand if someone does n't like that . 
  i mean , its a big deal . 
  but on the other hand , its not such a big deal . 
  thats how life and politics work . 
  swings from one side to other . 
  i ( in my stupid mind ) predicted it long time ago , the borders are going to close at some point . 
  the signs have been up for a while now , starting with merkel few years ago stating of the failure of integration and multiculturalism . 
  i think its great that we have mix of different cultures and races and all ( i as a eastern european wish we had it here more actually ) . 
  but i think in the west this `` new blood '' has to have some time to integrate now , become local people , blend in , otherwise people would n't be seeing them as `` others '' . 
  i think there is class problem with immigrants , and that has to change . 
  i know its borderline politically incorrect stuff to say , but we have to face the truth , certain trends are there and we have to talk about them , not ignore them . 
  ignorance is bliss . 
   i thought putin was elected democratically ? 
  if you control the media , kill journalists , jail opposition you are a dictator . 
  putin is still popular , no doubt about it . 
  but is it honest popularity , with controlled media and critics , doubt it . 
   political correctness destroys everything . 
  agree . 
  but it does kind of add a creepy twist to it , if its done by actual dictator . 
  edit : on the other hand . 
  it adds a extra humor twist to it too , bit darkish , but who does n't like dark , 
   to be fair whenever a country does go against the west out of its own accord usually it ends up with sanctions or war . 
  norway is threatened every day for not joining eu . 
  well , its easier to lie yourself into greatness than to be actually great . 
  to produce honey you need to do a lot of work . 
  even if russia suddenly turns around it will take probably several generations before they come close to europe . 
  `` aint nobody got time for that ! '', 
  putin . 
   putin has almost completed cleansed all opposition parties , and today ** standing against putin is viewed as standing against russia ** . 
  this is not the way it should be . 
  yes , this is very important point . 
  this is a very ill political situation . 
  stability is great . 
  but living under this type of soviet mentality , again , is just wrong . 
  i agree . 
  this is such a shame . 
  i think in the beginning of his term putin actually wanted to go more `` modern '' route . 
  but quite quickly he realized that holding power in russia is harder than getting into the power , and the only way to stay alive or out of jail is to go authoritarian . 
  and the longer he is a president the more he has to escalate the methods of suppressing his `` opposition '' . 
  he pretty much has driven himself into a corner where he has no options , he either is in power or he is fucked . 
  and it seems now he went full retardo with his methods , full on nationalism and further into totalitarian . 
  and we have no light in the end of the tunnel . 
  now , personally , i know this shit is for the long haul , living next to russia is guaranteed problems and fears for next 20 years . 
  just have to get used to the threat of `` green men '' or provocations for large portion of my life , as you never know when putin is going to start losing the grip again . 
  fuck this situation ... oh , but good for ukraine , georgia and moldova . 
  definitely step towards better life for them . 
  as estonian , the transformation we had for last 20 years is unbelievable . 
  especially the amount of corruption we got rid of is amazing . 
  thanks europe and especially scandinavia ( finland ) for being our moral compass . 
  hope similar changes in ukraine , georgia and moldova will take place !, 
  ... 2 . the russian federation , the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland and the united states of america reaffirm their obligation to refrain from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of ukraine , and that none of their weapons will ever be used against ukraine except in self-defence or otherwise in accordance with the charter of the united nations ; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nuclear_weapons_and_ukraine, 
  conviniently they discarded agreement with ukraine . 
  why would anyone take any treatis with russia seriously after that ? 
  germany is actually the only one in eu who could have some real weight protecting baltics and poland . 
  the lack of interest in us ( eastern block ) is depressing . 
  the fact that we ( small guys ) can not rely on our close ( and big ) neighbors ** within our union ** , instead have to look for protection across the ocean !!!?? 
  this is truly bizarre and depressing . 
  this well put . 
  agree with every sentence . 
   you people also have to accept that other people might have different moral values and think it 's a moral obligation to help those in need , even if it comes at a cost and let 's some freeloaders through . 
  yes , but you realize that sweden is one of the most equal countries ( for instance in gender issue ) . 
  and you are bringing in a lot of people who are coming from the opposite spectrum ( in gender issue ) . 
  it will not only mean you will have a lot more abuse of women in your country . 
  it means also inevitable backtracking of the gender progress , as they get their citizenship and are able to vote , and guess who gets their vote , i bet some chauvinist nutjob will suddenly appear who will exploit the situation . 
  pretty simple , france is in no direct risk from russia , baltics are . 
  suffering temporary economic falling is better than losing parts of your land or in worse case scenario going into `` civil war '' . 
  if russia is unpunished very simple truth from human behavior is that russia most probably continues with this `` lifestyle '' . 
  i think it really depends . 
  my parents are different ethnicity so they are well balanced with their media consumption . 
  i believe main problem with majority of russians ( in russia and abroad ) is that 80 % of them get their news from tv and pretty much all of the news regardig ukraine in a nutshell is like that op video . 
  so yes , local russians ( including in media , politics and just people i know ) seem to generally believe that ukrainians are turning into nazis etc. 
  and just for the people who are further away from russia . 
  i went at my parents the other day ( who have russian tv stations ) and at the news channel this was 24/7 . 
  it was mindblowing to what degree they are pushing this absolutely idiotic narrative about russia being threatened by nazis and us . 
  my superficial diagnose of post-soviet russian mentality is that they actually fabricate this grand-narrative to substitute the emptiness left by collapse of the `` empire '' . 
  average russian politician needs this story of `` nr .1 country in the world is their arch enemy '' , same story they grew up with to feel relevant again . 
  you can even notice how he emphasizes the fact that cold war is world war 3 and soon theres world war 4 ( actually 2nd cold war ) . 
  this overwrite of definitions makes them even more relevant in retrospective , puts them on the world map fighting for nr .1 spot against us . 
  the biggest trigger of this late aggression was not nato coming closer to russias borders as many claim . 
  it was the opposite , the fact that us was pulling out from europe and focusing on pacific , that was the real offense to post-soviet mind . 
  in short , my diagnose is that russia is suffering classical case of self-aggrandizement that is pretty common for ex-empires . 
  i just hope they are able to grow out of it without going too crazy ( germany is bad example of this ) . 
  i 'm actually very curious how will us react to the death of their empire ( which is arguably happening right now , in slower pace ) . 
  this is going to be real interesting . 
  but its another story and still to be seen . 
   lol , so does everyone . 
  everyone uses lying `` strategically '' except in the west there 's still some freedom of press left and lying actually might harm the lier . 
  nothing like that in russia . 
  first of all , separatists are the first ones to use assault rifles and rpgs to take over strategic objects . 
  and lets be frank here , current gov.

  i doubt that many people know the difference . 
  i think i 've seen one or two sikh turbans ever in estonia . 
  not really . 
  finland , obviously . 
   we really do n't have many streets named after foreign people , though , only the ones you listed that are ` collaterals ' based on the churches . 
  strange . 
  very-very few indeed . 
  there are plenty of non-estonians though , either famous baltic germans or russians , but almost all of them lived in estonia for some time . 
  a weird city-state that is n't really sovereign itself , but the holy see is a sovereign subject and it administers the vatican city state . 
  but as an atheist i do n't really care - it 's not like they force administration onto some people - they have no inhabitants by birth . 
  i never have to boil water . 
  and i only get burnt like once or twice a day . 
  [ johan laidoner ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/johan_laidoner ) was never a politician per se , but a military commander , known for his leadership in the victorious estonian war of independence . 
  estonian : - the continent : * euroopa * - the moon : * europa * because grammatical cases can be used differently for different words giving away different contexts , then confusion is n't common . 
  to talk about a specific location , then the interior locative cases ( i.e. 
  `` into '' , `` in '' , `` from within '' ) are used for the continent while exterior locative cases ( i.e. 
  `` onto '' , `` on '' and `` from on-top '' ) are used for the moon . 
  in tallinn : - bremen passage ( * bremeni k\u00e4ik * ) - iceland square ( * islandi v\u00e4ljak * ) - in front of our ministry of foreign affairs ( and its address is iceland square 1 ) - russian street ( * vene t\u00e4nav * ) - great america street ( * suur-ameerika t\u00e4nav * ) - all three are named after a former pub-guesthouse called `` america '' . 
  - middle america street ( * kesk-ameerika t\u00e4nav * ) - small america street ( * v\u00e4ike-ameerika t\u00e4nav * ) - danish king 's garden ( * taani kuninga aed * ) in tartu : - kaunas avenue ( * kaunase puiestee * ) - l\u00fcbeck street ( * l\u00fc\u00fcbeki t\u00e4nav * ) plus several streets/roads throughout the country are named after their destinations like st petersburg highway and riga street . 
  plus many streets named after churches , who have gotten their names from historical saints or monarchs like : - charles avenue ( * kaarli puiestee * ) - after charles xi of sweden - olaf 's hill ( * olevim\u00e4gi * ) - after olaf ii of norway, 
  left - hot , right - cold . 
  / or as in my apartment : left - boiling , middle - hot , right - cold . 
  no and i have yet to meet an estonian , who thinks like that . 
  are these two questions even related ? 
  our long-time head of government and first president [ ko\u0144stantin p\u00e4ts ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/konstantin_p\u00e4ts ) is still very controversial and the nation is sort of divided regardless of age groups . 
  pro : - founded one of the first estonian-language newspapers ; - one of the first estonians to become active in politics ; - took over tallinn town government from pro-german parties ; - had to flee the country after the 1905 revolution ; - headed the country during the estonian war of independence ; - was an active politician and occasional head of government throughout the democratic era . 
  contra : - organized a self-coup in 1934 , however it was after the relatively popular right-wing populist vaps movement had threatened to take power in any way possible , plus the parliament approved the coup after it happened ; - however he banned political parties and disbanded the parliament after that , set up censorship etc. 
  - he also took way too much time to fulfill his promise to return to a democracy ; - he set up political positions for many of his relatives . 
  - his eventual return to democracy was barely that , although it was definitely more democratic than his previous years in power . 
  he himself won the presidential elections in the parliament . 
  - he was in power when estonia was forced to accept soviet bases in our territory and when the soviet union invaded , so a lot of people blame him for his inactivity , some even see conspiracies of him having cooperated both politically and economically with the soviets and/or later being overplayed by them . 
  however the soviet occupation was sort of inevitable for us and it 's really not like he could have done something , plus he was eventually deported to russia and he died in imprisonment and received forced-upon psychological treatment . 
  well our only real city does have both historical suburbs like [ n\u00f5mme ] ( https://www.google.ee/maps/place/n\u00f5mme,+tallinn/@59.3735814,24.6560173,7118m/data=!3m2!1e3!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x469295155ee9b969:0x500b36d18fc7100!8m2!3d59.3765!4d24.6900999 ) and relatively new spread out suburbs like everything north of [ here ] ( https://www.google.ee/maps/dir/59.4431378,24.7952572/59.4936104,24.9314836/@59.4988642,24.6869932,25197m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m9!4m8!1m5!3m4!1m2!1d24.8274733!2d59.4524163!3s0x4692eccc59e88e5b:0x4ba98e35fdbc3306!1m0!3e0 ) on viimsi peninsula , everything north of [ here ] ( https://www.google.ee/maps/dir/59.4457287,24.496185/59.4271891,24.6632377/@59.4338177,24.5362189,12231m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m9!4m8!1m5!3m4!1m2!1d24.558224!2d59.4046368!3s0x4692966c3e9d19c3:0x48cd3ed1e29fa4f7!1m0!3e0 ) in the greater kakum\u00e4e peninsula area . 
  on the other hand due to the soviet occupation there are a few of very randomly put urban areas like [ maardu ] ( https://www.google.ee/maps/place/maardu,+harju+maakond/@59.4644798,24.9375587,7099m/data=!3m2!1e3!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x4692edea95997bbb:0x400b36d18fc61e0!8m2!3d59.4687696!4d24.9801867 ) . 
  administratively not much has been changed since the end of the soviet occupation - some suburban areas are within the town 's territory , while some function as villages in rural municipalities . 
  there are a few problems with russia . 
  finns have an awful number of badly-behaving tourists and latvia is a lot more corrupt than estonia . 
  from left to right : - centre party ( 28 % support , 27 % in parliament ) - nominally social liberalism but usually seen as the most left-wing of main parties . 
  strongly russian-dominated electorate , sort of a no-go party for younger and middle-aged estonians . 
  strongly corrupted , populist approach , inactive cooperation treaty with putin 's united russia party . 
  long time populist leader edgar savisaar finally suspended from office of tallinn mayor due to ongoing corruption investigations . 
  a more liberal leadership took power recently , but it will be seen how their electorate will react to that . 
  due to leadership change , two of the secondary coalition parties recently invited them to lead the coalition government . 
  biggest support in tallinn and northeastern estonia and among pensioners . 
  - social democrats ( 13 % support , 15 % in parliament ) - third way social democracy , so not that left wing , but more left wing than a few years ago . 
  some support among russians , but most of the votes come from estonians . 
  main candidate for a coalition partner as it lies ideologically between the centre party and the reform party . 
  biggest support in southeastern and central estonia and hiiumaa island . 
  - reform party ( 24 % support , 30 % in parliament ) - right-wing liberalism , was in power for 17 years in a row and headed the government for 11 years in a row . 
  recently has lost important senior politicians to important eu institutions . 
  junior politicians lack good leaders . 
  bad leadership , occasional major corruption scandals of its single members and general lack of new ideas recently saw them pushed out of the coalition . 
  biggest support in tallinn suburbs and surroundings and the second biggest town tartu . 
  - pro patria and res publica union ( 7 % support , 14 % in parliament ) - conservatism . 
  as hinted by the name and the existence of two following parties , conservatism is very divided and often collapsed in estonia . 
  this was the older pan-conservative political agreement in the country , but it has recently lost a lot of support . 
  them kicking reform out of the coalition and replacing them with the pro-russian party definitely did n't help . 
  biggest support in the estonian countryside . 
  - free party ( 9 % support , 8 % in parliament ) - conservative-liberal . 
  a new protest party with `` good ideas '' . 
  failed to compromise and join the coalition government . 
  literally does nothing . 
  biggest support among whoever feels intelligent enough to claim that everything is wrong , but does n't have any ideas on how to change things . 
  - conservative people 's party ( 11,5 % support , 7 % in parliament ) - right-wing populism , national conservatism . 
  * de facto * a new party that came with the general wave of populism . 
  uses way too much energy to fight against same-sex rights . 
  biggest support in western estonian countryside . 
  military is necessary , it may also be interesting and respectable , but not much to worship in the sense of glorification . 
  * riigivanem * ( `` state elder '' ) which was used for both hog ( + hos ) in 1920-1934 and hos in 1934-1938 . 
  croatia and norway for their beautiful coasts , but also bosnia and montenegro for their beautiful nature and architecture .

  it was like driving on `` moon surface '' ( * kuumaastik * ) . 
  asphalt usually goes from highways to the rural areas , but not within the rural areas . 
   each parish ( vald ) tends to have 1-2 churches and manors at most . 
  so not too common church parishes ( * kihelkond * ) , not municipal parishes ( * vald * ) . 
  plus many parish churches also had secondary churches and chapels . 
  we do n't have that word so much but * hui * , * pohui * and * nahui * are very common . 
  i agree .

  immigrants do n't really have any such expressions , russians usually turn to you with `` excuse me '' ( * vabandage * ) .

  my friend still has a bet with us that he will buy a bottle of cognac for the bum , who calls him a `` hegemon '' .

  in the opinion of finnish computer security expert mikko hypp\u00f6nen , the 2007 incident was indeed a watershed moment in history , but rather than calling it a war , it should be likened to `` cyber street riots . '',

  but it 's just weird that even when confronted with so many facts some scandinavians still are reluctant to call estonia nordic due to some cold war era bias . 
  because why would one finnic nation be nordic and the other one not . 
  and even more stupidly , why would the other finnic nation be baltic , which is another ethno-linguistic term , unlike nordic . 
   why are you nordic ? 
  what makes you nordic ? 
  you ca n't use the argument that finland is nordic . 
  read these and the link i provided . 
  - estonian is a finnic language , not a baltic language ; - estonian vikings ( oesellians in latin/english ) had close friendly and unfriendly contacts with the scandinavian vikings ; - several or entire estonian territories belonged to sweden or denmark in 1219-1346 and 1559-1710 , the swedish period is still referred to as `` the good old swedish times '' ; - the danish national flag allegedly fell from the sky during the battle with estonians in modern tallinn in 1219 . 
  even today , the coat of arms of tallinn and the surrounding harju county depict the danish dannebrog flag . 
  the coat of arms of estonia is basically the danish coat of arms without the crowns of the danish monarchy ; - the name of the capital tallinn is thought to derive from `` taani linn '' or `` danish town/burg/castle '' , as the danes built the first stone castle in tallinn and a town started to grow during the danish times ; - estonians are traditionally lutheran ; - estonians fought in the finnish winter war and especially the continuation war and there were finnish , swedish and danish volunteer units in the estonian war of independence ; - estonians share their national anthem melody with finland ; - there was a swedish minority in western estonia until 1944 and even today many local place names in vormsi and noarootsi parishes and naissaar island are actually swedish names . 
  there was even a swedish political party in the parliament in the interwar period ; - approximately 80,000 estonians fled to the west in 1944 , many to sweden and germany . 
  although many left for further west , tens of thousands remained in sweden . 
  there was an active expatriate estonian life in sweden and still is , with many estonian organizations . 
  there are approximately 26,000 estonians left in sweden . 
  the estonian government in exile had its headquarters in oslo , norway ; - a lot of cultural similarity with finland and also quite a lot with sweden . 
  for example we celebrate yule ( j\u00f5ulud ) instead of christmas . 
  the sauna originates just as much from estonia as it does from finland . 
  also , estonians share much of the cuisine with sweden and finland , although we have also much of the cuisine similar to germany and russia , due to different occupations ; - estonians self designate themselves as nordic people , rather than baltic people . 
  the estonian word for nordic countries `` p\u00f5hjamaad '' is basically the same as the finnish word `` pohjoismaat '' ; - lack of self determination as a baltic state , because we differ with latvians linguistically and with many latvians and basically all catholic lithuanians religiously , at least in the historical , pre irreligion era . 
  we may consider us a `` baltic state '' in certain context , for example geography , history during the soviet occupation , history related to baltic german upper class in the middle ages and modern relations with russia . 
  our historical ties with lithuania are limited to 100 years of a different type of russian rule and the common soviet occupation ; - estonian economy is dominated by swedes and finns and a lot of estonians work or travel in sweden and finland . 
  this is somewhat different from latvians and lithuanians , who have mostly gone to the uk , ireland and germany . 
  the estonians in sweden and finland have retained far more contacts or even a second home in estonia , unlike the expatriate latvians and lithuanians , who are mostly gone for good ; - although estonians have good interaction with latvians and a little with lithuanians , there are far fewer grassroots ties with them than with swedes and finns . 
  almost all estonians above 35 understand finnish , as northern estonians were able to watch finnish television during the soviet occupation . 
  also , there are surprisingly many estonians , who speak swedish . 
  in the same time , the amount of estonians , who speak latvian is close to zero . 
   answer yes to at least two out of three : what an abstract demand ...  you have to have more common history with the nordic nations , than any non-nordic nation . 
  depends on what you mean by common history and depends on whether you mean number of years only . 
  estonia and latvia have had similar history for about 800 years , but that 's because we have both almost always been ruled by the same foreign states and our independence periods have been during the same time . 
  is that common history ? 
  in a way , definitely . 
  but estonians and latvians remained relatively distant for most of this era as people could n't move around during serfdom and the land was ruled by baltic germans . 
  by the number of years , the livonian order period was the longest , but also quite distant . 
  estonian nationalism started in the end of the 19th century and defined estonians as a northern/nordic people . 
   you have to have a large portion of your population speaking one of the scandinavian languages . 
   you have to be culturally almost interchangeable with a nordic nation . 
  is finland ? 
  we have common culture , history and symbolism with finland , sweden and denmark . 
   are those not fair demands ? 
  abstract . 
   i 'm leaning torwards 2/3 middle eastern , 1/3 european . 
  more or less this , perhaps even 3/4 middle eastern and 1/4 european . 
   it is n't . 
  what i should have written is that swedish is a much more integrated part of finnish culture , than swedish is integrated in estonian culture . 
  did n't argue with this . 
  but where does the arbitrary line go ? 
   for an even shorter period of time , and not even covering all of estonia . 
  most of it . 
   you have a website dedicated to this ? 
  this is a blog by one interested person . 
   for us nordics it is mostly a joke ? 
  cool , it 's not like it 's so important for us either , it just bothers me how easily people put labels onto countries without thinking it through . 
   so bad ? 
  that 's your first mistake . 
   how come you estonians want to be nordics because ... we are ? 
   what would make it different ? 
  nothing ? 
   is it the nordic council , or what ? 
  eu = / = europe nordic council = / = nordic countries, 
   300 people are n't enough . 
  most of them fled before soviet reoccupation . 
  was estonia then nordic before that date ? 
   swedish is n't even an official language . 
  did n't know it was a requirement . 
  so are finns not nordic then and the swedish speakers there are ? 
  would finland not be nordic if they lost swedish as the official language ? 
  so many loopholes ...  ca . 
  160 years . 
  where there was close to non swedish settlers , if there were any at all . 
  it just is n't enough compared to the 600 years where finland was ruled by sweden . 
  yes , but estonia was also under danish rule . 
   you are not nordic . 
  no way you can twist or turn it will ever make you nordic . 
  eesti can not into nordic . 
  deep arguments , go and [ educate yourself ] ( http://www.nordicestonia.com ) . 
  deep . 
  we also have common history and a historical swedish speaking population . 
  so is finland then ? 
  could you pass him on to austria somehow ? 
  this is about latvia 2 . 
  nordic = / = northern europe 3 . 
  ( estonia is nordic ), 
  where ever you have roamed basically . 
  you already said baltic/balts . 
  if you said `` one group is central european '' , then the other is clearly northern european . . 
  plenty of hipsters among the youth here . 
  yeah sure , the nation that has been under serfdom for basically 650 years and occupied by foreign powers by 750 years has a lot of guilt ... 
  judging by the vast amount of comments , do we even have european muslims here ? 
  i do n't know , i just do n't think we care enough about these label differences . 
  if you have no non-black ancestors ( as seen by your skin tone ) , then surely you are black . 
  if you are mixed , then you are mixed . 
  people might say dark , but probably not black . 
  however if you consider who we would see as an ethnic estonian , then usually it is close to the `` one drop rule '' . 
  the media is the `` fourth estate '' , but because the heritage society has such a strong power , it can be seen as the `` fifth estate '' , especially among those who have real estate in these neighborhoods . 
  they are culturally very estonian , actually called the '' [ tallinn house ] ( https://et.wikipedia.org/wiki/tallinna_maja ) '' . 
  they started building them in 1912 and were mostly built during the interwar era . 
  they are sort of the later stage of the '' [ lender house ] ( https://et.wikipedia.org/wiki/lenderi_maja ) '' , popular in the late 19th and early 20th century in tallinn . 
  there are currently about 500 `` tallinn houses '' left , mostly [ within this area ] ( https://www.google.ee/maps/dir/59.4439435,24.7498562/59.4511555,24.721991/59.4448319,24.7024572/59.4164096,24.6921855/59.4111687,24.7151881/59.4230031,24.730466/59.417938,24.7478038/59.4301629,24.7780162/59.4358809,24.788745/59.4430816,24.7492629/@59.4299616,24.7162351,5968m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m57!4m56!1m5!3m4!1m2!1d24.7432608!2d59.4485155!3s0x4692937a9d2f2115:0xe69a7733640e1f38!1m0!1m5!3m4!1m2!1d24.7147622!2d59.4335362!3s0x46929487032b1def:0x7d626c0e26066afd!1m0!1m5!3m4!1m2!1d24.7326325!2d59.4144897!3s0x469294954ea5f5bb:0x46acb6b120dbb711!1m0!1m5!3m4!1m2!1d24.7554969!2d59.4214826!3s0x469294a4acec2c4b:0x68c21b017223149f!1m0!1m25!3m4!1m2!1d24.7822169!2d59.4391484!3s0x4692935a9612a1d1:0x511947e25af0ce45!3m4!1m2!1d24.7446191!2d59.427502!3s0x46929498ee6a1551:0x501538285dc17502!3m4!1m2!1d24.7266914!2d59.4281997!3s0x4692949ab25313eb:0x80bcaa9b70d1822b!3m4!1m2!1d24.7239768!2d59.4342956!3s0x46929483f508c27f:0x35a83b45fc45175d!3m4!1m2!1d24.7335555!2d59.4348774!3s0x4692949cd4f0170d:0x2e4e29a08736ce48!1m0!3e2 ) . 
  what ? 
  well that was clearly sarcasm .

  very proud of my country right now . 
  but i agree . 
  worried abuot the consequences . 
  was rather surprised we have such a big mass of bigots . 
  --  censor all critical with word islam in it . 
  because islamophobia < --, 
  i just watched lucy . 
  and reading these news i realised you really need 100 % of brain capacity to comprehend the amount of irony is in the russias accusation of ukraine being run by fascists . 
  dont bother correcting me :p i know premise of the movie is 20 year old myth of how brain works . 
   more people die every day from malaria than have ever died from ebola well , because ebola can turn africa on its head . 
  malaria does n't do it . 
  i think its about helping a whole continent when they are in trouble . 
  we as humans are supposed to do it . 
  even with the risk of getting the infection spreading across to other places . 
  okay , let 's see what we have here . 
  art rule nr .1 : be courageous - fail !, 
  this sounds very plausible . 
  this is actually interesting version i 've never considered  `` putin has worked the west out , '' says one gloomy polish official . 
  `` he knows we wo n't use force . '', 
  the darkest polish scenario is also that mr putin might be tempted to go up to the nuclear brink by using ** conventionally armed missiles that could carry nuclear warheads . 
  ** the dangers of such a policy hardly need spelling out . 
  ** but destroying the credibility of nato 's security guarantee to the balts -- and therefore of nato itself -- would be a tremendous prize for russia . 
   there is n't anything stopping him/them from going full nuclear . 
  even tho putin has huge support right now i think if he would drop a nuke he would n't last a day . 
  i ca n't imagine russian population be that crazy to allow him go full retard . 
   sigh , i wish people would stop going . 
  listen to last bbc hard talk with an expert . 
  he says the only way to contain it is to get much bigger centers where they can isolate the sick . 
  its the only way to lessen the impact . 
  otherwise it can reach pretty crazy levels . 
  and the worst part is that this outbreak destabilizes otherwise stable african nations . 
  and that can have much wider consequences . 
  from articles comment section :  america 's little tricks wo n't work in russia , , , america destabilized ukraine with speeches hacklers snipers and a puppet president ... 
  it wo n't work in russia they are much too smart ... 
  the media war tool america has worked so far be american and europeans are hearing one thing and seeing another , , , all the lies are not working so well ... 
  if russia loses we all lose ... russia now is all that is left between us and new world order ... america and the eu is new world order ... we will all be slaves once there finished, 
  am i ? 
  i was more saying they have different way understanding what news are . 
  or you could argue they have different definition of news . 
  too many people consume their news only from tv . 
  and i think main problem is the long history under authoritarian regimes . 
  they pretty much lack any experience of journalism and free press . 
  so its not about stupidity , but just that they do n't even know what they are missing . 
  talk to any pro-russian here . 
  they equate all journalism in the world in the same `` propaganda '' category . 
  russians read their news in a certain way ( a skill obtained in ussr where you read more between the lines and get some fuzzy picture ) and they are certain whole world works the same way . 
  i agree with you that people should bear the responsibility too . 
  at least great nations do - germans for instance . 
   they chose putin . 
  did they ? 
  because putin controlling pretty much all the media and political landscape . 
  i 'd say they chose an illusion , the picture putin is painting oh himself . 
  and even then if you try choosing something else you get f-d up . 
   you want to ( like russia ) erase history in what way did i suggest that ? 
   am talking about baltic states as a whole . 
  yes , me too pretty much . 
  how is that counter to my arguments . 
   hat 's great your russian family are doing well , but there are dissatisfied , and im a democrat who believes in equal right for minorities . 
  well . 
  there are dissatisfied estonians here too , what do you expect ? 
  about equal rights . 
  all rights are protected . 
  we are not russia . 
  language test is not an abuse nor does it take away anything from them or their culture . 
  i think baltic states earned their right to have a small request ( that is nothing special , as rest of the world does the same ) . 
  one day i watched russian news channels ( that i have at my parents ) . 
  and man ... you have no idea the poison they spew 24/7 . 
  it was beyond any expectations ( and i 've seen ussr propaganda first hand ) . 
  so yeah , i 'm not surprised . 
   ethnic russians in the baltic states want their culture recognized , even if they were put there ( that is not their fault ) what do you mean by recognized ? 
  because it is in my view . 
   russian is not even considered an official language in latvia . 
  i answered that one . 
  even though again , what are you asking for in practice ? 
  because you can do everything in russian language . 
  ( at least in estonia )  put yourself in an ethnic russian shoes in latvia . 
  i 'm half russian . 
  i live in estonia . 
  its great . 
  family side who is russian are doing great . 
  some of them barely speak estonian , yet they can navigate in their own language in every aspect of life . 
  i just think you actually do n't know what you are talking about . 
  and i 'm trying to draw you a picture what the realities are . 
  of course , russian propaganda paints pretty dark picture , but according to them norway is a hellhole in human rights aspect . 
   russian citizens are not allowed full passports because they consider themselves russian . 
  they must pass a culture and history exam in order to obtain this passport . 
  first of all . 
  your wording is bs . 
  `` russian citizens ** are not allowed ** full passports because they consider themselves russian . '', 
  what is this ? 
  everyone is allowed . 
  yes . 
  you do have to pass the test . 
  everyone does . 
  there are heaps of other ethnicities too , ukrainians belarus etc. 
  everyone has the same standards . 
  second . 
  you have to look at it in the wider context . 
  you cant just ignore the history of their arrival . 
  i 'm not saying they are to blame .

  however it 's very un-advertised , almost hidden . 
  no big logos etc. 
  1 ) all 3 languages are very different 2 ) there is a pan-baltic song festival of student choirs - gaudeamus, 
  no , it 's not connected to nfc in any way . 
  our digital id consists of 2 certificates : one for identity and second for signature . 
  these certificates can be either on your id-cards chip or on your sim-card 's chip inside your mobile phone . 
  use cases ? 
  did you read the original article ? 
  it says : '' in all , the estonian state offers 600 e-services to its citizens and 2,400 to businesses . '', 
  all these are use cases of our id infrastructure . 
  the main point of id-infrastructure is to provide government backed authentication and signing service to all service providers . 
  so they can build any service on top of that knowledge that : 1 ) they can identify a person with near 100 % certainty ( there are always some idiots who give their pin codes to someone else ) 2 ) they can exchange digitally signed documents with you or with all other service providers or with the government . 
  the signature - as said before - is backed by the government and has 100 % legal power . 
  the point here is that nothing 's integrated `` into a phone '' or `` into an id-card '' here estonia but only 2 certificates : one for your identity and the other for your digital signature . 
  id-card is a smartcard with a chip , so the certs sit safely there . 
  and for the phone the certs sit safely on the sim-card . 
  sim-cards are issued by the operators while their `` id-functionality '' must be activated in a special governmental website ( where you obviously authenticate yourself with your id-card ) . 
  after you 've got your mobile-id working you basically do n't need the id-card any more for authenticating yourself or for signing the docs or anything . 
  i personally have n't signed anything with my id-card at least for a few years ( have n't not signed almost anything manually for ... do n't remember how many years ) . 
  i use mobile-id all the time . 
  it 's really really good service . 
  everything else , all services are glued together by the national soa ( service oriented architecture ) - based system called x-road that uses our national pki ( public-key-infrastructure ) for authentication and signing . 
  that 's it . 
  the key is in services , integration and unified authentication over all systems that have been connected to x-road . 
  as an estonian i can confirm we even do n't need to carry driver 's license , car 's registry papers , insurance papers or whatsoever papers while driving . 
  just our id card would do so that cop can identify you and everything else is magic in their on-board computers . 
  i 've heard that sometimes you even do n't need your id-card since they can load your id-card from the net onto their computers in their car and identify you . 
  it 's a good digital life over here , 
  it 's shift - alt - 9 and shift - alt - 8 ( on mac osx ) \u2265 and \u2264, 
  bunch of tools . 
  they are tools that are used by some for specific purpose . 
  both are comparable in a way that pieces of body are cut from children without their consent . 
  clear enough ? 
  what if a culture would have `` a norm '' that every children 's right ear must be cut off or left eye or tongue for `` religious reasons '' or whatever ?!, 
  is that normal ?!, 
  wtf ... 
  the same way no religion should be forced on to children below 18 or whatever is the age in every country when children are considered to be adults . 
  as adults they can make their own choices . 
  source : i 'm from estonia , the least religious ( = with least public religion bullshit ) country in the europe . 
  any idea why it 's still called a `` song contest '' ? 
  is russia the only country , where clearly mad ( sick ) people are in the parliament ? 
  his condition and actions also speak a lot about these people who have voted for him . 
  you 're right . 
  instead it 's got a lot to do with nazism and fachism . 
  the russian ones . 
  it 's strange how beliefs of the parents are more or less automatically transferred ( read : forced ) to their children . 
  what about freedom of religion of children ? 
  what about children 's rights ? 
  children should be kept free of religion before they grow up and can make their own , concious choice . 
  in estonian it 's called '' \u00e4tt '' . 
  this means `` a really old man '' or `` an old man '', 
  estonia bans online casinos that have not registered by a government agency and do n't pay taxes . 
  this ban can also be easily circumvented by using alt dns .

  sure . 
  he can wait a month or two ... 
  it is true . 
  we even have it mentioned in a kid 's song '' ... lendas vene nii kui kuul ... siis me l\u00e4hme mallega ... '', 
  island could be called j\u00e4\u00e4maa . 
  would be cool , 
  these moments are those when i feel really proud as an estonian . 
  good job , our guys !, 
   once you 've tried it ( id-card or mobile-id ) you never want to go back to `` manual signing '' or papers . 
  paper and manual signature is so 20th century . 
  for those who are interested - i 've created a blog post about using our mobile-id for participating in elections : http://measure9.varkel.net/2013/10/voting-with-mobile-id-in-estonia-how-it-looks/, 
  i think estonian startup signwise is trying to achieve exactly that - pan-european standard for digital signing . 
  take a look : https://www.signwise.me/gb/en/global/, 
  are you sure that you have analyzed all the attack vectors that estonian architects and analysts have n't ? 
  let them know of your findings , 
  please read the specs and source code that is referred below . 
  of course there are some theoretical and even some practical problems . 
  for example people give the pin-codes of their personal certificate to someone else . 
  but even in this case it 's absolutely necessary to possess the physical id-card or person 's mobile phone ( sim-card with certs ) and the pin-codes and then vote for someone . 
  however this risk is mitigated by possibility to go and vote physically , too . 
  in this case the last one ( physical vote ) would count . 
  also - i can e-vote as many times as i want and only the last one counts . 
  i 've also written a blog post about how the e-voting with mobile phone looks . 
  take a look , too : http://measure9.varkel.net/2013/10/voting-with-mobile-id-in-estonia-how-it-looks/ , 
  give it a try . 
  the specs and the source code : * http://www.id.ee/public/the_estonian_id_card_and_digital_signature_concept.pdf * http://www.id.ee/?lang=en * http://sk.ee/en * https://github.com/vvk-ehk/evalimine, 
  horses have worked for centuries , too . 
   there is no way an electronic vote can be trusted and secret . 
  if you are willing to give up secrecy , ok .

  have you read the specs of the solution ?

  it was much worse in estonia this time . 
  a few buildings had their roofs torn off completely + a lot smaller damages to vehicles and buildings . 
  no human casualties so far afaik . 
  the article is in estonian , so use `` excellent '' google translate to translate it . 
  tl ; dr - neelie kroes is visiting tallinn and she was given her personalised id-card that holds her digital identity . 
  she gave a first digital signature with it and she seems to be happy about it . 
  look at that guy standing in the corner in the background ...  the devil ? 
  good !, 
  just to clarify - he used to be in kgb before estonia became independent . 
  he was hired by kapo ( estonian `` fbi '' ) because he could handle the old gear that kapo got from kgb when kgb left . 
  it makes sense when i drive around in estonia and look at all those big road building projects ( at tartu road , at narva road near rakvere , at \u00dclemiste ristmik ) and so on . 
  so basically estonia is very good in pouring eu money into concrete ... , 
  if greece made it then latvia can make ot , too , 
  i agree !,

  `` to effect [ woman 's ] emancipation and make her the equal of man , '' he wrote in 1919 , two years after the revolution , following the marxist theories that underlaid soviet communism , `` it is necessary to be socialized and for women to participate in common productive labor . 
  then woman will be the equal of man . 
  kingdom of hungary controlled croatia .

  that 's an extremely simplistic way of looking at things . 
  someone 's national belonging and/or ethnicity is a part of someone 's identity , just like gender , religion , ideology etc. 
  the only way you can end conflicts forever is by making everyone have the same universal identity . 
  no one must deviate from anyone , be it sexually , ethnically , religiously , ideologically or in any other form . 
  you are going to need 1984 . 
   they might not have done it what are the chances ? 
  0.01 % are innocent at most . 
  the taxpayer still has to provide for all the pedophiles , serial killers and rapists who actually committed crimes . 
  it 's not even 50/50 guilty and innocent , we 're talking microscopic percentages of innocent prisoners while the overwhelming majority outnumber those few innocents . 
  how can you justify making law abiding citizens provide for the most grotesque psychopaths ? 
   slippery slope why has n't that happened in the united states ? 
  why did n't it happen in all the european countries before it was outlawed ? 
  why should it specifically result in a slippery slope this time ? 
  i just do n't believe that 's going to happen . 
   cheap labour a good idea indeed , however with automation right around the corner what work could they really do ? 
  clean toilets ? 
  they will make robots for that . 
  work at a retirement home ? 
  i would n't trust a killer of 13 people to watch after my grandmother . 
  / r/europe would be the loudest one accusing turkey of undemocratic authoritarianism if turkey banned german and dutch citizens residing in turkey from voting in european referendums . 
  do n't you people see the hipocrisy ? 
  saying `` i support the death penalty in territory not governed by germany '' is unconstitutional ? 
  the german constitution does not apply to turkey . 
  unless you 're talking about the genuine chromosomal outliers , what 's `` retarded '' is subjective . 
  so what 's your counter argument , besides `` every human is precious and valuable , he just made a mistake '' ?

  poem about southern europe -- gim me gim me chicken tendies , be they crispy or from wendys . 
  spend my hard-earned good-boy points , on kid 's meal ball pit burger joints . 
  mummy lifts me to the car , to find me tendies near and far . 
  enjoy my tasty tendie treats , in comfy big boy booster seats . 
  mcdonald 's , hardee 's , popeye 's , cane 's , but of my tendies none remains . 
  she tries to make me take a nappy , but sleeping does n't make me happy . 
  tendies are the only food , that puts me in the napping mood . 
  i 'll scream and shout and make a fuss , i 'll scratch , i 'll bite , i 'll even cuss !, 
  tendies are my heart 's desire , fueled by raging , hungry fire . 
  mummy sobs and wails and cries , but tears are n't tendies , nugs or fries . 
  my good-boy points were fairly earned , to buy the tendies that i 've yearned . 
  but there 's no tendies on my plate !, 
  did mummy think that i 'd just ate ? 
  `` tendies tendies get them now , you fat , ungrateful , sluggish sow ! '', 
  i screech while hurling into her eyes , my foul-smell bowel-dwelling diaper surprise . 
  for she who is un-pooped on is she who remembers : never forget my chicken tenders . 
  soviet buildings would be plain , cheap looking cement blocks with rough edges .

  `` generation identity '' , by markus willinger . 
  a relatively short read . 
  check the edit on my original post too fam, 
  that looks like a few hundred people at least . 
  i would n't say that 's barely any ... 
  barely any would be 20 larpers surrounded by 400 protesters . 
  if i had n't looked at your english translation , i would have translated it into estonian like this : ta katsus katust , kui k\u00e4rbes tapeti tapeedil - he touched the roof when a fly on the wallpaper was killed . 
  when i said this two months ago i got downvoted to -70 and was promptly banned for a month . 
  look how the tables have turned . 
  99.9 % of all human history before the french revolution = xenophobia . 
   the average redditor thinks that more books = more intelligence you ca n't make this shit up . 
  harry potter and other such fiction books are entertainment just like movies and games . 
  just because you read youth literature does n't mean you 're somehow smart . 
  just because sharia is traditionalist does n't mean it 's european traditionalism , which we desire . 
  it 's like arguing that organisms which need oxygen are actually projecting their need for helium - they can not survive in neither a vacuum nor in an atmosphere filled with helium , they need an oxygen rich atmosphere . 
  same applies for european people , we can not survive in an egalitarian or a sharia society , we need traditionalism which is suited for europeans . 
  we need to undo the values of the french revolution if we want europeans to survive . 
  he is denying his masculinity if he 's not providing for his wife and children or working towards it . 
  you sure the old and educated will have a higher turnout rate than the populists ? 
  the populist voter base is generally more enthusiastic and loyal than the centrist voter base , simply because the populist base cares about politics more . 
  he 's absolutely correct you know . 
  if an european has any sense of what 's going on , they know that scandinavians and germans absolutely love to deconstruct every accepted social norm , because that 's progressive for them . 
  if one painter paints beautiful greenfields and villages , and another painter flings period blood at the canvas because that is `` unique and avant-garde '' , then poland is the former , while scandinavia , germany , the uk , netherlands and france are the latter . 
  estonia is the impressionable young child who sees all the praise the `` avant garde '' artist gets , so he becomes interested in this art revolving around shock and `` deconstructing archaic norms '' as well . 
  yes , this should n't even be a question . 
  the german and swedish subreddits will love to discuss this though , believe me . 
  russia is n't third world , have some respect for yourself . 
  according to that list , finland had one in 2004 , and two in the 1930s , yet finland is not coloured . 
  map is still bad . 
  estonia does n't have tornadoes , yet we are orange on that map . 
  6000 people in one high school alone ? 
  my peanut brain can hardly comprehend that . 
  my school that had grades 1-12 had around 600-800 people total , in tallinn . 
  at most i 'd expect a school with grades 1-12 to have 1500 people . 
  8000 people sounds like hell . 
  unleash the military police , be ruthless and do n't show mercy . 
  these people can not be reasoned with , the only reason why they 're rioting is because they want to break shit and cause chaos , they want to `` feel alive '' since life is too boring for them . 
  such brutes can only be controlled with violence and harsh punishments . 
  more does not mean better . 
  i never said i want free shit . 
  i want to buy things i need with my own money . 
  i want to form a contract with an insurance company specialising in policing , i want to crowdfund roads with my neighbourhood , and the currency used is decided by the parties signing the contract . 
  bitcoin is n't controlled by any government , yet you can buy products and services with it right now . 
   because if we had them without taxes , then only those that paid for them could use them , like the largest of business .

  in estonia there has been - on the contrary - some controversy , as the families who are poor tend to have more children because they want to get the child support . 
  the map itself says 2010 ? 
   whatever the positive effects of immigration from ee - of which i am certain there were many ... 
  i have only two words for that - zlatan ibrahimovi\u0107 . 
  for starters , we could discuss the german influence in finland and in estonia ( hanseatic league ) . 
  then you should not forget that estonia was also [ 160 years ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/duchy_of_estonia_ ( 1561 % e2 % 80 % 931721 \\ ) ) part of swedish empire . 
  and that finland was also ca 100 years part of russian empire . 
  and finland got its independence in the beginning of 20th c. around the same time as estonia . 
  yeah , so do we . 
  albeit finland is ` soome ' not some county name . 
  i pay 5 $ for 5gb ( lte ) . 
  estonia ? 
  as per the picture above ? 
  i just ca n't understand when she is so peace loving , why to talk ( repeatedly ) about that putin has right to send in tanks to estonia . 
  http://i.imgur.com/1xaxd.jpg i think this is a pretty good analysis of communism , because it is true . 
  yeah , i actually _ should _ know it 's more complicated than that . 
  now i myself have fallen into the trap of hasty generalization . 
  thanks for correcting me . 
  i think someone brought a very good parallel with the irish . 
  ireland is part of british isles , but it would be wrong and problematic to call the irish brits . 
  see my comment here : https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/63qxcc/if_you_want_to_see_russian_information_warfare_at/dfwgaev/, 
  i think that 's the whole problem actually . 
  the scandinavian countries have their language similarity and also balkans , but we have here three quite separate languages and this in reality hinders the cooperation . 
  for ( uneducated ) estonians it is much easier to go to finland , where they learn the language quickly etc. 
  this is also one of the reasons that estonia feels closer to finland . 
  that 's not some kind of snobbery , but just language affinity . 
  balts applies to ethnicity , baltics to the region . 
  it 's confusing , indeed . 
  yes baltics would be correct term here . 
  but you have to understand the frustration , when you are abroad and then people just assume that 1 ) we all ( baltics ) speak nearly the same language 2 ) this language is basically russian language with some minor differences . 
  yeah , but the question was about _ balts _ not baltic countries . 
  they have many bad _ hombres _ over there . 
  i think it was very well and cleverly done by not mentioning any members and when did different countries join . 
  this way the only focus was on the eu itself , as it should be . 
  right , but at the same time latvians and lithuanians are happier than us . 
  not by a huge margin , but still . 
  btw estonians feel _ less _ happy than people in russia , that is telling . 
  there were both estonia ( commonly called esthia in latin texts ) and livonia . 
  livonia comprised of southern estonia and northern latvia . 
  see here : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/livonia#/media/file:sw_balticprov_en.png, 
  yes , riga polythechnicum was established then . 
  there was no university in riga at that time , it was established only in 1919 . 
  i think the map consciously avoids university towns . 
  uppsala , turku , tartu , lund are all absent ( also greifswald , for that matter , which for a while was also swedish ) . 
  good , thanks for the clarification . 
  i wonder how accurate the methodology is . 
  i looked at the estonians and was surprised not to see arvo p\u00e4rt there , though according to wikipedia `` p\u00e4rt has been the most performed living composer in the world for five consecutive years . '', 
  but maybe `` fame '' means not what i think it means . 
  yeah , but i would say they found good resonance with soviet ideology ( no personality , just effectiveness , no need for comfortable life etc ) . 
  that 's why soviets had a deep fascination for such buildings and that 's why people who lived under their rule detest those . 
  i can very well imagine someone who never has had to live in such a building could be interested and maybe even a bit intrigued by their sheer monstrosity . 
  could it be that many associate the horrible commieblocks with ... er communism ? 
  the period we were occupied and repressed etc. 
  north korea style . 
  disliking that does not make me a nazi , i hope . 
  i 've been there , albeit quite many years ago . 
  i was visiting the buddhist monasteries there , definitely worth the trip . 
  the map of course only has data on countries that _ matter _ . 
  they were there already _ before _ the roman empire . 
  there were greek colonies in crimea ( also these parts belonged to roman empire ) , but the maps do not show it . 
  estonia was nearly on par with finland , so there you have it . 
  yeah , i had a friend who hanged himself . 
  a really sad story . 
  but seems that contrary to all the speculation here , there are effective ways to do it . 
  anyway , it 's a joke only . 
  as it is now , there does not actually exist any real possibility for us to be accepted as nordic . 
  it truly feels like a playground with all the rich cool kids and poor nerds . 
  here are some statistics , i 'm not sure from where you take yours . 
   only vodafone is publicly saying that it will let customers use every bit of data abroad that they 're entitled to at home . 
  change your operator then ? 
  vote with your wallet etc. 
   yeah , but he was german . 
  undeniable fact . 
  he spoke german as his native tongue , but was still polish , i would say . 
  edit : i think this quote sums the debate quite nicely :  taking everything into consideration , there is good reason to regard him both as a german and as a pole : and yet , in the sense that modern nationalists understand it , he was neither . 
  sorry \u0442\u0438\u043c\u0443\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0446 , i have no warm feelings for gaidar propaganda stories . 
  what 's the problem , i ca n't understand . 
  do you consider her not awarded enough or what 's the reason of this snark ? 
    campaigning journalist  that 's called an activist . 
  if you 're pushing an agenda , you 're not a journalist , as you 're no longer reporting facts . 
    her work has been recognized by both amnesty international  the same organization that says that trump is literally hitler ? 
    and the russian union of journalists  but russia does n't have free journalism !, 
  or does it ?!, 
  because if it does n't then this organization ca n't exist and commend an activist . 
   more so from the article :   open russia , an opposition platform funded by millionaire mikhail khodorkovsky with whom svetova has worked , has said that there are currently two fsb officers and 10 investigators in her home . 
   also worked with the person who literally scammed russians in 90s and engaged in illegal tax evasion later but playing a victim now , campaigning for a violent coup in russia while living abroad . 
  how wonderful . 
  sorry , i cited the whole post , it 's just incredible . 
  i only provided some info about a journalist . 
  you , however , found a possibility to slander the journalist and act outraged as if the said journalist is rotten to core only because she has received international recognition for her work . 
  let me help you :  zoya svetova is a campaigning journalist living and working in moscow . 
  her work has been recognized by both amnesty international and the russian union of journalists , and she is twice-laureate of the sakharov prize `` for journalism as an act of conscience '' . 
  zoya also serves as a member of the moscow public oversight commission for prisons . 
  source : https://www.opendemocracy.net/author/zoya-svetova, 
  haa , i like your selection of translations . 
  yksinkertainen equivalent would be ainukordne , which has a bit different meaning in estonian . 
  but it 's pronounced differently . 
   in the portuguese language , the symbol \u00d5 stands for a nasal close-mid back rounded vowel , also written [ \u00f5 ] in ipa . 
  it is not considered an independent letter of the alphabet . 
   in estonian , \u00d5 is the 27th letter of the alphabet ( between w and \u00c4 ) , used to represent a vowel characteristic of estonian , the unrounded back vowel / \u0264 / , which may be mid back , close back , or mid central .

for me it seems that they play the european public . 
  if we get too mad , the politicians have to stop buying the cheap gas and lose their popularity . 
  the slow play lets the west save their face and postpone the backslash in economy/political popularity . 
  the west basically sells the countries out like it was done to eastern europe post ww2 . 
  this will be repeated : russia has been working their propaganda for years . 
  rest of georgia , full ukraine , then baltics , finland , if you look at the propaganda front . 
  for estonia you basically need only the eastern part as the power-plants are situated almost next to russian border . 
  slow motion in the sense that you wont go bananas out of rage as it escalates over months . 
  not 1000 tanks but 5 . 
  then 20 . 
  we think that gas is still worth the lives and ukrainian occupation . 
  since france will still sell its copter assault ship to russia we have already decided that russia will have crimea and anything else it can pry off ukraine as far as the slow motion war remains off from the public eyes . 
  as far as the west can keep its face , that is . 
  parallels to pre war germany are worrying . 
  apalling stuff . 
  yes . 
  probably . 
  russian slow motion war is difficult to recognize in western media . 
  i kind of discovered already , but also kind of forgot to return here out of shame of not knowing . 
  we should unsync the festivals by shifting one 2 years ... 
  how many years between your festivals ? 
  there is a live [ youtube broadcast of the event ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ox72iffxf4 ) which probably does not do the thing justice . 
  imagine a singing hundred-meter-wall of people in 2000 + point surround of doom or something ... 
  for me the incredible part is that he actually handles the twitter instead of handling it off to some pr-person . 
  could it be some rule about red turn signal lights being permitted and people flocking to register their cars there ? 
  i know that some people register their cars abroad due to this : it should not , however , add up to such a great difference . 
  i see two issues . 
  both good i the long run . 
  firstly the security will most likely fail when netsec guys get their hands on the drivers and cards . 
  it will be fixed . 
  secondly our current systems are not scalable as they are built for 1.5 million users max . 
  this will create a hurdle , but we can solve it hopefully . 
  yes ; this exact subreddit is sadly also a theatre of war . 
  the thing is that the fishermen pull barrels up more regularly than one would expect . 
  they throw them back asap and wont report it as paperwork and decontamination procedures cost them time and money and they lose their haul . 
  civil unrest does happen if you need to invade . 
  all in all it might not be worth it . 
  who fights a world war over 1 million people and some oil-shale , peck of forest and some nice beach ? 
  one of the sides must be willing to answe ` yes ' . 
  i mean maidan . 
  do n't call a country shitty . 
  for me the question is : would i fight for ukraine in a trench ? 
  for lithuania ? 
  for estonia , finland , sweden ... for ukraine the empire has calculated that nobody will care more than barely necessary . 
  france will sell its invasion ships , germany needs its gas . 
  we are selling ukraine out . 
  yet they were the first to die under european union flag . 
  the language spoken by the people of twitter , of course ... 
  twitter has responded by terminating diplomatic relations with turkey ; there are mixed reports about twitter citizens being subjected to violence . 
  the streets of ankara and istanbul are filled with people walking and singing in twittish . 
  most of the signs refer to the turkish pm not being very intelligent . 
  on sunday we had some ; was n't as bad ice-wise , but it was -7 and it 's yet to reach above 0 ; my car still has a nice shiny shell , 
  there was a red-black-white candidate at some point ... 
  estonians are absolutely fine with those rules too . 
  you may ask a question , though ( the polish rule from lared930 ) . 
  oh ; forgot to look a the context ; they are all compound words made out of of 2 or 3 letter vocals-only words . 
  it 's polite to do so , yes . 
  both of those are not in common use , but imply a somewhat punny context . 
  i mean i can say `` mu t\u00f6\u00f6-\u00f6\u00f6 oli pikk ja raske '' ( my night shift was tedious ) , but it 's not how i 'd speak without wordplay . 
  j\u00e4\u00e4 \u00e4\u00e4r is mostly also written with a space . 
  triple wowels do exist , but it 's polite to add a dash to signify the word borders . 
  did n't know the holland part ; i wonder why . 
  for technically valid things we also have : j\u00e4\u00e4\u00e4\u00e4r meaning ice-edge and t\u00f6\u00f6-\u00f6\u00f6 meaning a work-night , 
  they should have a military term , `` doijitsu '' , probably involving something that you can do with tanks . 
  you could use idamaa , but this one is reserved for oriental or middle-eastern areas . 
  also , we speak as we write so the strange dotted things sound like this : a - car e - meadow i - history o - morning u - music \u00f5 - moment \u00e4 - ashes \u00f6 - emergency \u00fc - [ does not map well ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/close_front_rounded_vowel ), 
  georgia sounds stupid in estonia , but as i have understood , gruusia is a bit derogatory and the people do n't like to be called like this . 
  so i 'm adapting , albeit slowly . 
  `` rembember estonians ! '', 
  this was the last thing that a danish grandfather told to his relatives upon his deathbed . 
  estonia and denmark used to be agriculturally similar ; danes had learnt some of our methods and there was amount of commerce . 
  he had taken the soviet occupation of estonia into his heart . 
  for him , the countries were similar ; he probably had had many contacts with estonians over his years . 
  he considered it a grave betrayal ; the fact how the scandinavia stood silent about it . 
  so , he said `` remember estonians '' to remind you all that you have to have your own military and never trust anyone else with securing you as your neighbours will become strangely silent and mind their own when you get occupied . 
  a story i heard from a friend , told by a danish woman once . 
  \u00f5e\u00e4ia-oaaia-oa\u00f5ieau if you strecth the mecry ( the honour of bean-flower of sisters ' father-in-law 's bean garden ) . 
  we have also russian : venelane , meaning `` boater '' . 
  my guess is that they are stalling to get past the winter . 
  you do n't want to lose russian gas in the middle of the winter . 
  you get a revolution . 
  why the mummy ? 
  for estonia the ability to recover was an exeption . 
  we had austerity , yes , but the country tried hard to use up all the european aid it could absorb during the crisis . 
  estonia has also some roaming permissions . 
  you can go wherever the land is not marked as `` eramaa '' ( private ) and also you can travel along the shores of lakes , streams and rivers ( 10m from it ) as you please . 
  someone needs to link this russian mudstrip which eats zigulies for lunch . 
  yea , we hide them in those bogs, 
  to give more reasons for russia to invade , of course . 
  georgia is really eager to be invaded , you know . 
  rember the reason to us invading iraq  russian populace is made to feel endangered by the really small countries . 
  chechnya , georgia and also estonia . 
  we do n't even have a tank . 
  how did the snooping become a public knowledge and how was it justified ? 
  if dutch do it , the equipment has been sold to everyone by now ... 
  ** estonia ** * the flagship of our navy will be returned to denmark since it has been sitting idle since 2008 due to lack of money . 
  * the populist party started proceedings to declare e-voting uncostitutional ( their voters do n't vote using computers ( or brains ) ) . 
  * more girls using tobacco, 
  yes , this is exactly the thin i have seen happening around tallinn too . 
  the filter was really weak some years ago , but after the university adapted somewhat , the foreigners are all nice .

  and what 's wrong with these names ? 
  they are usually named after historical regions !, 
  threat in general is of course bigger than threat of a military invasion , that goes without saying . 
  however you put the threat of an invasion to a ridiculously low percentage . 
  i am talking of hundreds of people , perhaps over a thousand in total , who get along in common events . 
  that is a subculture , i do n't understand why you are fighting this so much . 
   literaraly in my whole life i 've never met person in `` fraternity '' and i have to say this is your loss . 
  i have personally interacted with dozens of polish fraternity members and i 've visited them several times . 
   saying that they exist is borderline dishonest . 
  seriously , [ wtf dude ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--gaqqqfjzg ) . 
  oh do n't worry , they offer [ free counter-holidays ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwlkilxbghg ) in return . 
  no matter how much i try to give facts stating the opposite , people still seem to think that it 's nonexistent in europe . 
  it 's just not the same as in the us , it does n't follow the same traditions and heritage . 
  from my personal experience the burschenschaften are generally crazy radical . 
  ( though one of the friendliest of these organizations i once interacted with was also a very moderate burschenschaft , but i think it was rather an exception as they themselves confirmed it too ), 
  i ca n't believe people sometimes . 
  i only answered facts that they do exist and i was immediately downvoted ... 
  do n't you know what a subculture is ? 
  i mean , i have personally experienced that very same subculture in poland . 
  considering you 're not part of that very small subculture and i am in a nearby country , it 's not surprising that i know more about it than you . 
   i used them as mine opinion , you can say your numbers based on your opinion but such numbers are ridiculous . 
   2 . i strongly disagree , world right now is very different , in both cases very dangerous times of course it 's different , but there are very strong parallels to be drawn here . 
   usa is threat to other countries , while being democratic , because democratic , dictatorship doesnt matter if you follow your national interests and geopolitical goals do n't be undemocratic then . 
  i personally support toppling harsh dictatorships . 
   possibly yes i 'm having a hard time understanding what sentence are you answering to from here on . 
   i said i don t see possibility of russian invasion and you asked that ... 
  i understand the naive westerners , who never see russian crimes happening before they already happened , but you ...  good for business meant as sentence used for this matter . 
  it means playing with such card is great for domestic audience and achieving certain goals , similar to putin playing western or nato card or americans playing soviet now putin card . 
  all main parties play that card , and for a reason - because it 's real !, 
   last point - i meant that huge majority of public can be influenced by media or politicians playing games and lying so the aforementioned russian actions are lies now ? 
   my only issue here is that i believe in different possibility of russian invasion to baltic trio or poland than you do ( which is understandable as you are estonian and i am slovak ) you see it at 0.00 x1 % , we see it a little higher than that . 
  where , it does n't really matter . 
  we are not hysterical about it , we just do n't stand the naivety of someone , who claims that there is no threat in russia for us . 
  i 've heard horror stories about russian tourists , but it probably depends on the visited nation and the purpose of the visit , i.e. 
  estonia is worth a visit for seeing old towns or walking in the nature , which does n't really invite the worst of the worst from russia as i can imagine the beach resorts in spain might do . 
  i still have to say that in estonia it is rather the finnish booze tourists or the british stag parties . 
  what do you mean ? 
  it is definitely a subculture in germany , poland , estonia and latvia . 
  just a very different subculture . 
   i never said my numbers are from intelligence services . 
  then why use them ? 
   you can t compare world in 40s with 2016 ... 
  they are not the same , yet they are not totally different either . 
   whole world changed like 4x in that time . 
  tell me , if you get a different result when you do the following calculation :  y x 2 / 4 x 4 / 2  usa is also democratic so what ? 
  and the us is not a threat to us , in fact it 's our strongest ally . 
   argumenting with democracy is useless . 
  no it is not . 
  cooperating democratic countries are very unlikely to attack each other , while undemocratic alienating country may be very hostile , at least very unpredictable . 
   have concept of national interests and their foreign and security policies are based on such concept and how to achieve those goals . 
  do the interests of democratic countries also mean that their democratic allies lose territory ? 
   based on my deep knowledge of russian ( also american , , chinese and french concepts ) i really at this point don t see possibility of russian army invading estonia . 
  so we should disband our military , right ? 
   i do understand people in baltics or poland have different view on this topic based on multiple factors . 
  yeah , first being history , second being that we are not blind nor deaf . 
   i would give you an example , playing with russian card is good for business , just like here was for ages playing with hungarian card . 
  how is it good for business again ? 
   people listen to their politicians and media and their views are skewed . 
  if our politicians would say to trust russia in the current geopolitical atmosphere , after invading georgia and ukraine , constantly violating our air space and territorial waters , kidnapping our security official from within our territory and organizing massive war games with attack purposes , then nobody would take our politicians seriously ... 
  germany is a peaceful democratic country , and both a military and political ally of slovakia , just like austria is a political ally of slovakia . 
  russia and belarus are neither democratic , russia is hostile and are de facto enemies of nato . 
  how can you even compare the two ?? 
   no there is no benefit in taking estonia . 
  neither was there in 1940 ...  that % i gave was in current situation , if you would hypothitecally leave nato than % would go up signifficantly . 
  of course it would , but your numbers are just pulled from the hat ... 
  not really underground , but they all have like a hundred members in total , with alumni , so they are indeed small if compared to the total polish student population . 
  it sure should be about averages . 
  hopefully your school was an exception in this , yet i 'm quite sure there were cheater schools in every country . 
  and of course tests are not everything , but they are something , 
  fraternities and sororities are social organizations rather than special purpose interest groups . 
  not that they do n't sometimes take part of student policy making . 
  what do n't we get in your mind ? 
  of course it could be better , it always could and should . 
  but compared to the rest of the world and especially europe , the finnish and estonian systems are the best . 
  americans follow the greek system , we here follow the german system . 
  they differ like day and night . 
  it 's not like you ca n't go out anymore after joining a student organization ... 
  i would n't say the life within the organizations is ever boring . 
  i understand that , it 's a subculture anyway in every country . 
  there are very few left nowadays , but the ones i mentioned are quite active . 
  and quite honestly , your loss !, 
  what if i told you that student organizations offer many valuable experiences at organization , leadership and public speaking , plus a good way to have your party life in a cheap , controlled and safe environment withe people , who you are most likely going to stay friends with for your whole lifetime . 
  i 've had both very good and very bad experiences with german student organization members . 
  some are indeed quite right-wing and rather arrogant people . 
  others drink so much that it 's even disgusting to just watch . 
  but then there are other , more moderate organizations where people drink and act normally . 
  we are usually quiet with strangers when sober , but a couple of drinks in our bodies and we become more talkative . 
  plus saunas , do n't get me started on how chatty we become in saunas !, 
   and your media are probably showing russian tanks on your borders every day not really . 
   but seriously you think threat is real ? 
  quite definitely . 
   possibility of russian invasion to estonia or latvia is about 0.01 % and you 've become an oracle !, 
   nato membership flaky . 
  there are plenty of those , who would argue against going to a war with russia because of us . 
   you are actually richer country so ? 
   no historical region what ? 
   those russians are how you like to call it immigrants , not region that was for centuries russian ida-viru county is majority russian . 
  it does n't much matter to them that it 's recent . 
   so there would be no justification you underestimate the russian media and the russian logic . 
   no strategic value or economic benefit .

  i agree , the term eastern europe is not very helpful any more , as it lumps together countries that have now very little in common . 
  but i think the overall assessment of low participation in political processes is spot on , also kind of disillusionment about the government is also a trait i can see a lot around here . 
  [ the report ] ( http://pages.eiu.com/rs/783-xmc-194/images/democracy_index_2016.pdf ) describes the problems as follows :  the eastern europe region is characterised by low levels of popular support for democracy . 
  much of this stems from widespread disappointment with the political and economic transition from communism . 
  indeed , political culture is the region 's second-worst category , and recent surveys have affirmed this characteristic . 
  the adult population in most countries shows only moderate or low interest in following politics , and there is widespread cynicism towards state institutions and political parties . 
  this is exacerbated by political parties ' weak roots among voters and the poor functioning of many governments . 
  not a single country in the region evinces a high level of popular support for democracy . 
  just no . 
  but really , this is just one possibility , the other one being it related to aestii . 
  yeah , none of the commentators are from baltics , mind you . 
  but even so , only one ( the french one ) can be interpreted as threat of aggression and others are quite vague . 
  whereas we have something like this :  what will remain of the baltics ? 
  nothing will remain of them . 
  nato airplanes are stationed there . 
  there 's an anti-missile defense system . 
  in poland -- the baltics -- they are on the whole doomed . 
  they 'll be wiped out . 
  there will be nothing left . 
  let them re-think this , these leaders of these little dwarf states . 
  how they are leaving themselves vulnerable . 
  source : http://www.interpretermag.com/russia-this-week-roots-of-pro-russian-separatists-in-russian-ultranationalist-groups/ i know it is _ only _ zhirinovsky , but stuff like this is aired on russian state tv constantly ... 
  we quite specifically talked about baltics . 
  i of course know the attitudes of estonians best , but i presume latvians and lithuanians are not very much different regarding this matter . 
  still , would be interesting to see , because , really , it 's hard to believe that these people would exist . 
  really , i have not . 
  definitely i have not combed through all of the posts here , but i usually have a look what my fellow estonians say , and no , i have not seen any call to war against russia . 
  closest what you can find is ( somehow , most of the time not `` lethal aid '' ) helping ukrainians , but this is a completely different can of worms . 
   i 've seen plenty of posts on this sub even , made by baltic people , calling for war with russia , so perhaps that person had a reason to wonder . 
  really ? 
  please point me to one ? 
  i do not know anyone - including from tv and estonian speaking internet - who would wish to have an armed conflict with russia ( or with anyone else , for that matter ) . 
  yeah , but everyone in russia knows that the puny baltics are the worst ( and most laughable ) warmongers !, 
  just recently someone from russia said that why do we want war with russia , do n't we understand that this will be a catastrophe . 
  i do n't even ... 
  i know the etymology ( its _ radix _ ) , but had the more colloquial meaning in mind . 
  by radical i mean here actually extremists ( in the sense that these people are on the fringes ) , by fundamentalist i have in mind the ones who aim to go back to the roots . 
  i would say that in christianity they are quite distinct groups and the fundamentalists are oftentimes quiet and not very visible ( i.e. 
  the amish groups are definitely christian fundamentalists in the sense of `` traditionalist '' ) . 
  yep , though christian radicalism ( i hesitate to call it fundamentalism , as majority of those radicals are not fundamentalists , but simply radical tools ) which for a long time was not very visible , is somehow creeping into the picture again , along with all other kinds of marginal groups ( nazis , racists etc ) . 
  seems that this day and age is somehow fostering radicalism , no heed of the ideology behind it .

  did a search but this sort of escaped me ... 
  i do n't know , there are indeed lots of feeds from romania , but most of them ( i checked just now ) were of people eating and hairdressing etc.

  you think you know , but it is weird that an atheist prescribes beliefs for others . 
  there are lots of good theological arguments for permitting gay marriage .

  good job , i really wish estonian lutheran church would follow the lead .

  church of sweden and church of norway both belong .

  so , do you really think that native english speakers have no advantage in academia ? 
  or why we are here talking in english ? 
  have you wondered why there are mostly english speaking universities at the top ? 
  the whole academic ranking game is heavily skewed towards english speakers . 
  these universities are all of course good and especially in us and switzerland pay handsome salaries ( which helps to lure better people ) , but it does not inherently mean that something is done systematically better there . 
   also tbh , 0.05 % of our contribution is not even pocket change for the entire nato budghet . 
  this does not matter at all . 
  it 's the principle that counts and willingness to do your share . 
  ultimately this is what collective defense is about . 
  ok , you are correct , estonia has just been before 2015 a tiny bit short of 2 % , i wonder why there are different figures around . 
  link ? 
  this is incorrect . 
  estonia has met the 2 % target since 2012 . 
  edit :  [ source ] by 2012 , the us-europe ratio had altered to a further 72-28 , and while the uk , france and greece remained on the list , a new and unexpected actor -- estonia -- rose to that level for the first time in its history  http://estonianworld.com/security/estonias-defence-spending-upholding-nato-commitment/, 
  it is also arguable that the referendum was not organized according to any accepted standards ( `` unknown '' gunmen keeping watch ! ), 
  and widely not recognized as democratic . 
  at the same time there are many straightforward [ legal problems ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/crimean_status_referendum,_2014#legal_aspects ) with the joining of russia itself , even if it were in every other respect all right . 
  there was no official agreement about the expansion of nato , however there was an official agreement about the [ territorial integrity of ukraine ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/budapest_memorandum_on_security_assurances ) . 
  there is absolutely no sense of arguing about that , russia violated written agreement , nato did not . 
  to be honest , this would make a lot of sense . 
  i would cautiously ask whether estonia would be able to join , albeit being at the same time quite sure that `` eesti kan not into nordic . '', 
  [ strange times in berry club , strange times indeed . 
  please note that i wrote  switzerland is at the top ( among other reasons ) i am very much aware of the quality of swiss universities . 
  but still , money ( regardless of other things ) plays an important role in creating good academic environment , as you have noted yourself . 
  especially when you need expensive lab equipment etc. 
  definitely , i 'm not denying that , it 's a cumulative effect . 
  but when you look at the table you 'll also see that at the top are countries with a ) good salaries b ) relatively small population . 
  probably this is counted not by nationality , but by university affiliation - i.e. 
  when i 'm by nationality estonian but affiliated to university of z\u00fcrich , then the papers i write are counted as swiss . 
  the reason switzerland is at the top is ( among other reasons ) that the salaries of academics in switzerland ( and in the nordics ) are considerably higher than elsewhere . 
  so when i get some eu funding it makes sense for me to go to a place where they pay me more than go to some place ( ee countries ) where my salary is much less . 
  the salaries of academics are dependent on local pay-grade . 
  this is sometimes really weird , as you can have one collaborative project where there are researchers in estonia and in finland and the finnish colleagues get paid four times as much as estonian researches , doing the same job . 
  so usually the solution is that the estonian researchers are for the time being affiliated also to the other university to get equal pay . 
  meaning of course that also their articles are counted as `` finnish '' . 
  yeah , the difference is only 4mm , probably just small enough that you can use the same wheelsets .

  shitty russian/zoviet cars . 
  older models without water cooling , i think their first model was a ripoff ( or licensed ? ),

  my point is - applying `` white man 's '' , `` thinking man 's '' or `` homo sapiens ' '' logic to the actions and reasoning of `` homo kbg '' or `` homo sovieticus '' is just wrong , misleading and dangerous .

  you know - there is a sequel of russian movies called smth like `` peculiarities of the national fishing '' , hunting , politics etc.

  i 'm sure these will be funny . 
  however now turn off your humor - this is the truth . 
  russians are exactly that crazy ans even crazier . 
  now imagine that crazy officers with access to red buttons . 
  seems fair only if a country 's legitimate government has invited them . 
  it 's occupation otherwise . 
  it 's bullshit . 
  these are not soviets , these are local separatists who bought their tanks from the flea market . 
  the sane flea market on one of pictures . 
  russians never do such bad things as invasion and occupation . 
  it 's not funny because you have n't been occupied by soviets . 
  you do n't have loads and loads of citizens or non-citizens in your country who are most likely loyal to publicly unfriendly neighbour country rather than the country of their citizenship . 
  these people will be used as an excuse to invade if needed . 
  russia needs to `` protect their lives '' or whatever from `` the bad fascist '' ( us , natives ) or nato even though the quality of life on our side of the border is much better than on the other side of the border . 
  any excuse is good for russia . 
  however - nowadays they are even that cynical and careless that they do n't need many excuses any more as we can see in ukraine . 
  just lie openly , publicly , lie big and that 's it . 
  normal people just can not argue with liars on that scale . 
  that 's sad . 
  and so on and on . 
  you do n't understand the situation because you have n't felt it on your own skin . 
  we have . 
  that 's the biggest underestimation that the westeners do - they underestimate russians ' craziness and ability to act crazy . 
  western people care about at least their own lives while russians do not . 
  for me ( i 'm from estonia and i kind of know russians ) it 's completely logical and possible that russians may fire nukes just because they can . 
  you need to understand - human life is not of highest value for them the same way it is valued in the west .

  i really want to know how i - as a taxpayer - cause any problems to mr putin and russian nation while i 'm trying hard to live in peace here in my fathers ' land . 
  just to make it clear - estonia has not threatened russia in any way . 
  estonia has not occupied russia . 
  estonia has not deported russian citizens to very far places with very harsh climate . 
  estonia has not killed nearly all of its elite . 
  russia/ussr has . 
  done . 
  all . 
  and i would n't like to give a single fuck about putin 's intentions , interests or whatever but i 'm forced to do because of this amok-running czar . 
  i just want to live in peace here in the territory that belongs to estonian republic and its citizens . 
  we have exactly the same proverb in estonian : `` sobib nagu rusikas silmaauku ''  another good one is `` sobib nagu sea selga sadul '' .

  maarahvas is used in a bit different context to call these people who live in the countryside ( outside towns and cities ) . 
  maausk is widely popular i guess but it 's very informal . 
  i mean i do n't believe in any bullshit from eastern countries ( any * ism ) but i do believe that every living thing ( a bee , a tree , a whatever in the forest so to say ) must be handled with respect .

  there are a few people who take maausk more seriously , as a religion . 
  it 's not totally banned .

  ussr life expectancy was nowhere near the us in the 60s and early 70s . 
  i have seen this claimed before and the wikipedia sources eventually lead to some opinion article in a magazine that does n't offer further sources . 
  here is russian life expectancy chart - http://i.imgur.com/4krfewj.png, 
  that is certainly one of the things . 
  i am not even focusing on romania alone nor am i saying that romania was fully free market in 1990 ( it lagged behind others like poland , who are also in the list ) , but it had taken steps toward becoming a measurable economy with currency being freely convertible since 1989 for example . 
  economy with limited price controls is still somewhat measurable instead of one with full price controls and non-convertible currency . 
  czech republic and poland etc. . . were ahead in reforms and i dare say their economies could already be measured in 1990 . 
  there is a difference between measurable economy and recovered economy . 
  it was a slow process to move toward either , but as the first steps of reforms the economy started to get more and more measurable even though it was still in bad shape . 
  one of the worst features of centrally controlled planned economy was that no one knew what was going on . 
  of course all these countries had scars from the commie ruined economy , but i am talking specifically about being able to perform basic measurements . 
  look at the soviet union in 1990 - the official currency exchange rate was ~ 0.6 rubles for a dollar , but that was on paper only as no one was able to acquire foreign currency at that rate . 
  in june 1990 estonian bank carried a currency auction and dollars were bought at the rate of 27 rubles for 1 . 
  that is 43.5 times the difference between the official rate and what enterprises were willing to pay . 
  very hard to get realistic economic measurements in so distorted system , but that sort of thing was gone in countries like poland by 1990 already . 
  finland is `` special '' . 
  sorry if this comes across as harsh , but as long as your ignorance is at the level as you readily admit and your other comments show then perhaps you should n't try to explain things based on just guesswork and rumors from very dubious sources . 
  i get that you are not looking to be a commie apologist , but the false arguments you wrote here are the ones invented by commie apologists and these apply to their invented dream world past and not to an actual history . 
  usually commie country measurements would be all wrong because of price controls and non-convertible currency with huge differences between official and real exchange rate , but this is not the case in op-s picture as all the former commie countries listed there had gotten rid of these distortions by 1990 . 
   i may be just parroting what i was taught that you do . 
  you are repeating absolutely made up `` history '' for the purpose of apologism . 
  edit : i phrased it badly . 
  i did n't want to say the purpose of your post is apologism . 
  i want to say that these made up ` facts ' you rely were made up for the purpose of commie apologism . 
  these countries were not communist yet in 1938 and not any more in 1990 . 
  they had free market , no price controls and convertible currency so the gdp measurement in 1990 can be rather accurate . 
  how can you throw him out if you do n't know he is playing pokemon ? 
  that is why he was n't thrown out . 
  he just had his phone out , so who could tell . 
  he was arrested only after uploading his video , where people saw that he was in fact pokemonging . 
  this is establishing a practice where people at seemingly random are given harsh punishments for minor things . 
  once it is a common practice it is easier to intimidate others as they know that ridiculous sentences is the norm in russia . 
  say that a civic movement not liked by kremlin rises . 
  members of that movement may fall under scrutiny and unless they turn their life into strictly walking the line some are hit with one of these ridiculous sentences . 
  that does enough to discourage people from participating in these movements . 
  i am agreeing you that it was more . 
  it was much more considering that at that time and technology level the long range missiles were slow to set ready and clumsy and short range missiles were the only available surprise attack weapon . 
  there is much more to this . 
  in 1962 short range missiles could be readied quickly and stay ready to launch . 
  long range missiles took days to be made ready to launch and could stay ready only for a short time . 
  currently all missiles are ready all the time . 
  the man was convicted for this text  `` the communists and germany jointly invaded poland , sparking off the second world war . 
  that is , communism and nazism closely collaborated , yet for some reason they blame bandera who was in a german concentration camp for declaring ukrainian independence '' . 
  of course the real reason was that he wrote an article that kremlin did n't like , but that was the crime-part in the court proceedings . 
  of course they all know it is not true . 
  that is not the point there . 
  the point is to show that anybody can be sent to prison for ridiculous reasons . 
  quite strong warning to those discontent and looking to do something about it through civic processes . 
  are you in fact aware of wikileaks recent doings ? 
  like them attacking panama papers leak as `` western plot to harm putin '' and their actions during the current us election season when they are misrepresenting , sensationalizing , teasing and plainly lying in order to influence people to vote for trump . 
   surely not for us . 
  for germany ? 
  i think it worked out quite well . 
  first of all west germany were n't allowed to be invaded by the ussr and by the end of the cold war east germany was freed . 
  and during his current presidency the gdp is falling off the cliff after all . 
  a bit heavier sanctions would give the fall some boost and make putin or any other russian leader realize that invading neigbours has downsides too . 
  name 3 most important exposes . 
  if you ca n't name 3 then just one . 
  can you name any from the past 5 years ? 
  their mentality makes them make a lot of noise about how they are not afraid of the hardship before the hardship actually arrives , but they 'll fold very easily . 
  putin 's legitimacy and the reason why russians tolerate all this crap from their elite is that 90s were economically hard and ( although through luck ) putin 's reign has not been . 
  when things were to get hard again that legitimacy would be gone . 
  he does more than exposing . 
  he is actively trying to influence things by sensationalized promises of leaks to come , selective releasing at crucial times and even by outright lying . 
  this is how he has spent the trust credit he once had with people . 
  i am not saying that assange should be restricted from tweeting and neither is the article . 
  i am saying that i 'd felt better if more and more people were to find out what a crook that man is to properly assess how much to trust him and i believe the article helps with that . 
  timing also matters because voting matters in western countries . 
  sometimes voting matters tremendously as was recently the case with the brexit referendum . 
  russia tailors their propaganda to work on dumb people and dumb people are likely to choose a radical ideology . 
  all far - movements are also somewhat political outsiders so arguments prefixed with `` unlike what the mainstream view '' are strong arguments for them . 
  media mainstream in europe and usa has also f * cked up too many times so many people are rightfully skeptical of them , so a swedish press covering up something about immigrant mass sexual harassment in festivals might push some people to accept russian lies and conspiracy theories without even critically examining them . 
  they are not really that cornered and sanctions are disappointingly mild . 
  there are a lot of things russia can do to get the sanctions eased , but russia is just not interested in doing that . 
  perhaps if the sanctions were a bit harsher . 
  bob beckel is not `` hillary clinton strategist '' . 
  he also made this comment in 2010 . 
  wikileaks digging it up right now in election time and adding a non-existing hillary connection to it is them manufacturing scandals from nothing . 
  the video was presented as us helicopter murdering journalists in cold blood . 
  all the commentary given together with the video was selling this angle . 
  what the video showed in reality was helicopter acting as it should in conflict zone , but that is not readily apparent to 99.999 % of us who are n't military pilots . 
  winston churchill said , `` a lie gets halfway around the world before the truth has a chance to get its pants on . 
  '' , and the production of these lies is what we see wikileaks engaging in . 
  who are these few and why are they in isolation cells ? 
  i am still waiting for the release of that bombshell on russia wikileaks announced at 26 oct 2010 . 
  looks like something came out of russia at least once and reached wikileaks . 
  they still have n't published anything yet though . 
   wikileaks has published more than 650,000 documents about russian & president putin , most of which is critical . 
  can you name 3 important things that wikileak revealed about russia ? 
  can you name even one ? 
  can you name one important thing they have revealed about russia during the past 5 years ? 
  that is really not the case with many of these sensationalized leaks . 
  for example the famous ` collateral murder ' video , that was first shown in edited version and even when watching the unedited version it is not easy to see what is going on . 
  yet the news cycle is so fast that the accompanying unfair commentary has the chance to influence the public and even when the corrections come out later they do n't usually influence the low information voter base that the prepared sensations are designed to influence . 
  trying to cultivate eton 5 ? 
  europe is fine . 
  russian economy is in serious trouble . 
  that is behind the intense russian lobby to remove the sanctions . 
  just need to give a bit of time for the hangover to set in and russians will be much mellower . 
  then for the starters putin will stop his war in east ukraine and some of the sanctions will be relieved .

   you already hate russians for fictious reasons . 
  fictitious ? 
  my grandmother was in gulag and her whole family was shot for having a farm . 
  and please , remind me again what you were whining about ? 
  oh right , a test . 
  you are 1000 times worse than what you are blaming others to be . 
  yes . 
  this is a type of communication is preferable . 
  thank you . 
  the fact that there are countries with larger emigration does n't make my argument less true . 
  and quantity of education does n't mean quality of education . 
  just googled top-unis in the world . 
  russia has none in top-200 . 
  making light of latvians suffering . 
  yet very upset over the language test . 
  chauvinism much ? 
  do n't expect to be liked anywhere in eastern europe . 
  i 'm sure there are plenty of intelligent putin supporters ( which is scary ) . 
  but i think we are talking in general here ( which is kind of obvious ) . 
  the brain drain will have an effect on russia , and like i said , i believe it will be beneficial for putin . 
  it is only an opinion and is clearly based on generalization ( how else would it possible to talk about social matters ), 
  many were forcefully deported and murdered and whole country oppressed for 50 years . 
  by the way . 
  countries that are not occupied by russia do build houses you know . 
  this is perhaps something that is not covered in your education . 
  west has some journalism left in it . 
  you got ta know where to look . 
  are you working in rt ? 
   it was a union . 
  lol . 
  with buch of occupied countries with oppressive machine run from kremlin . 
  sweet union . 
   people born in normal countries do not have to pass exams to get citizenship . 
  unrestricted birthright citizenship mostly in south-america . 
  quite the opposite . 
  if people here would n't be satirizing rt i would be worried . 
  what you mean they did not come from russia ? 
  where did they come from then ? 
  ussr was russia . 
  occupying baltics . 
  why else would todays russia sue lithuanian citizens for avoiding ussr army . 
  by the way . 
  you are a good chauvinistic example of lack of respect for sovereign countries citizenship exams . 
  but i guess it does n't come as a surprise . 
  you realise that russian propaganda has become a parody of itself and people are ridiculing it here ? 
  http://rt.com edit : on a more serious note . 
  just made a quick google and first article on rt had 13 matches for `` fascist '' . 
  come on man . 
  do n't play stupid . 
  i 'm not going to even bother to go through rt-s history to link probably hundreds of articles like that about ukraine . 
  just observe rt for couple of days , you 'll get your answers . 
  thats probably actually beneficial to putin . 
  all he needs is his oil and stupid people ( the stupider the better ) who believe and support his bs and he is set for life . 
  yeah , like in every other country on this planet . 
  how awful . 
  if i would like to get an us citizenship or russias , i would not have a chance . 
  i would need some very special skills and papers . 
  but every russian who 's living here can apply for citizenship without any of that . 
  the entitlement for russians you seem to have everything handed on silver platter is beyond my understanding . 
  well , since they are russians by ethnicity and originally by homeland we kind of give them that option . 
  and like i said . 
  many of them just choose so called `` gray passport '' which gives them options that they would n't have with citizenship . 
  but i see . 
  this is the type of freedom they need to be protected from . 
  freedom of choice is a fascists invention , need eradicate !, 
  so they have a choice , if they want it or not . 
  edit : and a lot of them choose not to because it benefits them . 
  they have open borders to the west and to the east . 
  no its not lacking democracy . 
  some of them did apply for citizenship and some of them did n't . 
  we are not going to impose the citizenship by force . 
  this video is horrible . 
  what are you talking about ? 
   the baltic nations could just introduce official bilingualism like finland has with swedish ( despite sweden 's colonial history ) . 
   nothing good comes with denying a large chunk of your population to use the language they grew up with for filing taxes and doing other types of business . 
  pretty much everything you can imagine can be done in russian language here in estonia . 
  everywhere i look i see two or three languages represented ( estonian , russian , english ) . 
   tl ; dr russians are not too well integrated and tend to be pro-putin , but they do not support an invasion because life 's better here . 
  russians did not support russian invasion in ukraine either . 
  you create a warzone you polarize people beyond usual mentality . 
  thats great . 
  nice to wake up every morning for last few months and think maybe i have to go to fucking war soon . 
  because putin wants to `` protect '' half of my relatives living here in baltics . 
  i could run . 
  but what about my parents . 
  they are old and they have everything here , are they capable of running anymore ? 
  do i have to stay and fight - meaning freaking die !, 
  because who can win more than hundred time larger country . 
  what happened russia really ? 
  how is it possible to become such an idiotic state so fast ? 
  your protection rather shitty . 
  thanks to your ongoing landgrab attempt in ukraine thousands of russians killed . 
  so you are saying vkontakte should be banned everywhere except russia ? 
  it kind of beats the purpose of these social sites , doesnt it ? 
   but if tomorrow 's news said that russia was pulling your data you would be whining as well . 
  it is a governments duty to protect its citizens from any unlawful breach of their privacy . 
  nope . 
  i am not whining even tho i know russia ** is ** pulling data . 
  i am just choosing not to use vkontakte nor yandex . 
   how the fuck are we this worst country ever ??

man , i 'm glad a lot of the art and jewellery stolen by the soviets is still sitting safely in the vaults under kremlin , not at a decrepit mine . / s, 
  i think you 're mixing up estonian war of independence with finnish civil war . 
  interestingly it 's called pickle season in estonia . 
  indeed , they are . 
  if only i could be so grossly incandescent !, 
  did n't know ezio auditore was actually serbian . 
  in other news , to commemorate 11 ' 000 years of finno-estonian ties , estonia has erected 10-meter high giant moose filled with vana tallinn . 
  it 'll be easy as long as the karlings are not united . 
  you still need to gain ruthenia to form your empire again !, 
  i would put more weight on [ treaty of tartu , feb 2 , 1920 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/treaty_of_tartu_%28russian%e2%80%93estonian%29 ) - it 's one thing to declare independence , but another to win it , huzzah !, 
  finnish and estonian languages do n't have any genders and it makes life so much easier . 
  funny , from what i 've heard from my mother and grandmother , the reason for shortages was always `` they 're shipping everything to moscow '' . 
  that was amazing !, 
  minimum wage is guaranteed , plus any other benefits a usual employee is entitled to . 
  many of the locations , such as special care centers will provide you with food and lodgings . 
  that 's f ` ed up . 
  as i said , if things like these would 've happened in the company i was in ( apart from maybe sleep and food deprivation during survival camp ) there would 've been serious complaints made by the conscripts to the chief inspector 's office ( it 's a pretty effective way to get the idiot in charge transferred away from training units ) . 
  are you sure you 're not talking about the '90s era , because this shit is n't in no way prevalent today . 
  about the alternative for pacifists and veggies , say it with me : `` substitute service '' . 
  it 's a completely viable way to avoid the armed forces and everything that comes with it . 
  i am absolutely with you on the fact , that being in an army , even for only 8 months is n't for everyone . 
  i have a friend , who has gone through the substitute service , exactly because of the fact he was a vegetarian . 
  girls , who talk about the army making men out of boys and all that make my shit boil . 
  what 's even worse is when it comes out of the mouths of politicians , who like hell have gone through the conscription . 
  but , yeah , the kra needs to straighten its shit out to filter out people , who are unfit for the armed service . 
  and they need to make the substitute service more visible option to people , who have moral qualms with the army . 
  by macho men , do you mean estonians ? 
  * `` fulfilling nato requirement of 2 % of gdp defense spending while flexing microscopic guns at russia . 
  you can always apply for substitute service though : / , dunno , why people do n't use that option . 
  btw , do you have any specifics on the `` inhumane punishment '' ? 
  i went through my service a couple of years ago and everyone in the cadre was very aware of lines that they must n't cross , otherwise there would 've been a shitstorm of complaints started by the conscripts . 
  i agree , that the training can be some times psychologically pretty intensive , but people , who would not be able to deal with it should have been already filtered out by the initial medical examination ( kapsas kra kapsaaeda ) . 
  in my mind , conscription is a `` necessary evil '' . 
  but right now , in estonia , it 's way too long . 
  they could remove all of the lollygaggin ( lol ) and condense the training into max 6 months . 
  also , there has to be some kind of gender equality . 
  let all of the girls go through a civil service type thing , with an option of substitute armed service , for the same amount of time as guys have to spend . 
  * a word, 
  first of april ... crap . 
  am i the only one , who remembers h. clinton and her big red reset button , that she gifted to lavrov , during obama 's first term ? 
  but the difference is that it 's an official nato channel , not a quasi news service . 
  i 've got the exact same opinion . 
  americans could pull out of europe tomorrow , if they wanted , but they 're here just because nato obligates them ( maybe excluding air bases in italy , that they need for their `` force projection '' to sandlands ) . 
  european defense should be a european matter . 
  the fastest rocket , in the world . 
  damnit , i failed to get a rise out of you :d . i 'd actually really love to see more cooperation between baltic armed forces - joint arms procurements and so on . 
  sounds like when shit hits the fan [ estonians need to come save latvia 's ass again ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/estonian_war_of_independence#war_against_the_landeswehr ) , har har . 
  i always get a profound sadness when thinking about those unmarked graves . 
  i bet every european country has their own `` bonefields '' that still produce unidentified bodies and war material . 
  a lot of affection indeed , someone needs to gift you a puppy so you 'd stop torturing people . 
  my brother would knock my lights out if i 'd try to kiss him . 
  so would my mother , come to think of it : \\, 
   they only gon na send there weapons to save human rights . 
  can you provide sources to back that up , pretty please ? 
  inb4 vague russian nuclear threats ... 
  yeah , it 's a good , short read , but the conclusion is pretty scary for us balts . 
  i think this document counts military manpower in battalions because russian army is still draft-based and as such every brigade can realistically deploy only one or two battalions while the rest are in reserve . 
  sure , i pulled the numbers from http://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/research_reports/rr1200/rr1253/rand_rr1253.pdf, 
  russia already has vast superiority in the region . 
  there 's approximately 27 motorized/mechanized/armored battalions in full readiness in russian western and kaliningrad defense districts . 
  baltic nations have about 11 battalions worth of infantry , supported by ~ 2 us airborne , 1 british air-assault and 1 us stryker ( the only armored unit here ) battalion that are in sufficient readiness levels to respond . 
  they also have superiority or at least parity in the sky . 
  i 'm not even gon na mention their short range cruise/ballistic missile capabilities in the region . 
  those 40 000 troops will hopefully level the playing field a little . 
  russia also has been ramping up their defense expenditure for the last ten years now ( including modernizing their nuclear armament ) . 
  what i 'm trying to say is that the cold war 2.0 started a long time ago and nato is dragging way behind . 
  you have been in contact with delfi.ee commenters - seek medical assistance immediately !, 
  a deterrent against our eastern neighbor does n't need to be ready for ww3 - the aforementioned seven brigades is a tiny fraction of forces that were arrayed in west germany during the cold war . 
  but even that would require costly force projection capability from european armies , that they lack - unlike the americans . 
  forget about overseas deployment - i would like to know how would european powers deal with the defense of our eastern border . 
  it would take about seven brigades with all the corresponding support assets supplementing the baltic forces to pose any meaningful defensive deterrent here . 
  that 200bn worth of troops and equipment wo n't do jack shit in the hypothetical defense of the baltics either . 
  your comment is a little odd . 
  you do realize it 's the estonian govt that 's financing these russian-language schools ? 
  anyway , i do n't see the us funding spanish-language schools for their mexican immigrants or the germans funding turkish-language schools for theirs . 
  both of these immigrant groups are expected to learn the local state language and so are the russians expected to learn estonian language . 
  is that unreasonable ? 
  estonian defense forces is equipped with mistral manpads . 
  no medium or long-range anti-air defenses though . 
  i might be wrong , but was n't most of the us spying action in complete cooperation with our own intelligence services ? 
  besides , russian old school spies are still as active as ever . 
  i 'd say stick to the devil you know . 
  russia is just too unpredictable and unreliable . 
  whatever he was doing there ( the most popular unconfirmed theory is investigation of smuggling , which could be linked with fsb activity ) he was doing on our side of the border . 
  there was evidence of smoke grenades being used and the local border guards had their radio frequencies jammed during the incident . 
  besides , what kind of spy would carry his passport while doing something covert ? 
  what could possibly legitimize snatching someone from within another sovereign country ? 
  * edit : concerning the main topic - eastern and western europe will never have the same perception of russia simply because of our geographical locations . 
  while the western europeans form their perception based on world news headlines we here have to deal with russian bullshit on a daily basis . 
  dude , you 're talking about a country that [ kidnapped a police officer from inside eu/nato borders ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eston_kohver#detained_by_russian_authorities ) ... 
  yeltsin has much better reputation here in the baltics thanks to promptly recognizing our independence once he had taken power - all the while the west was much more hesitant on the whole baltics issue . 
  cheese ? 
  friend , clearly you do not know what is a proper zakuska . 
  please bring some pickles and herring with fresh onion rings . 
  or if you want to party like a true slav prince bring some caviar !, 
  only 11 % of estonians , who work in finland have some sort of higher education . 
  ^ so , ^ to ^ paraphrase ^ a ^ modern ^ classic ^ we 're ^ not ^ sending ^ our ^ best . 
  ^ ^ they ^ ^ bring ^ ^ drugs , ^ ^ crime . 
  ^ ^ they 're ^ ^ rapists . 
  ^ ^ ^ and ^ ^ ^ some ^ ^ ^ i ^ ^ ^ assume ^ ^ ^ are ^ ^ ^ good ^ ^ ^ people .

  but ... why would you watch news if they are known to be some one-sided propaganda ? 
  i mean , i 'd want to get the most unbiased news and i 'm definitely not going to watch some 2-3 differently biased propgrams and then hope that i 'll go for the golden midway and get the truth . 
  could you explain how would it work out ? 
  where would people be housed when the khruschevkas are demolished and how are they assigned new apartmens ? 
  ouch . 
  thanks for explaining . 
  i asked as we have a similar character here . 
  mayor of tallinn , edgar savisaar , currently his position is halted due to corruption charges . 
  very popular among pensioners and russians ( tallinn is 40 % russian-speaking ) . 
  fortunately , his political career seems to be over as of now , as criminal charges , health issues and massive drop in oral capablity have taken him down . 
  considering public broadcaster is funded from the taxes , i ca n't find it acceptable that it 's somehow government propaganda mouthpiece . 
  i assume wiadomosci is the most watched news program in poland . 
   the government-owned media in poland have worked that way since i can remember , and i 'm completely unsurprised that this tradition was retained with the most recent government change . 
  it 's not government-owned media , it 's the public broadcaster . 
  there should be a change in thinking there in poland . 
  it 's for the people , not the government . 
  absolutely does n't work like that in estonia . 
  the public broadcaster might be leaning towards government , but i do n't even notice it . 
  we had a government change and i have n't noticed any differences in reporting . 
  meanwhile , wiadomosci does n't even refrain from outright lying about what 's discussed in a summit . 
  obama 's speech and re-electing tusk ? 
  evil german spy and what else . 
  that should be unacceptable from the national broadcaster . 
  edit : public broadcaster , not government broadcaster, 
  they are all eu citizens who have been granted such rights after the societies have reformed-democratized and which all share some common values with wide supervision mechanisms etc. 
  what 's the point with such `` edgy comments '' ? 
  one of the most important points of eu is the fact that we 've accepted each other as trustworthy partners with similar culture and common values . 
  we 've * not * done that with syria or nigeria . 
  if you think there 's no difference , go vote for such parties that stand for it . 
  as it is now , majority of europeans see non-eu immigrants in a rather negative light , especially those from middle east and africa . 
  is it a mass of pensioners with such religious support for him ? 
  considering what government propaganda mouthpiece is tvp 's wiadomosci , it 's not great . 
  the national broadcaster should at least try to be impartial . 
  yes . 
  and these are people who have allegedly had background checks . 
  under the refugee distribution plan , estonia has taken just 142 refugees that are supposedly hand-picked and have had background checks . 
  out of those , around 30 are `` travelling around europe '' ( it 's likely that most of them have left to germany ) , 2 are under arrest ( one threatened to kill his wife , another is suspected to have infllamed his wife ) . 
  one thing is sure . 
  we are having an unprecedented number of welfare shopper migrants whose # 1 priority is not safety , but the `` promised land '' . 
  the refugee quotas just do n't work and germany will end up taking most of the refugees in one way or another . 
  second thing is the cultural clash . 
  estonia 's president said even in a speech that estonia is not obliged to change its customs , even such as offering some special cuisines . 
  does that mean that refugees have additonal motivation to go to the already existing isolated enclaves of their countrymen in western europe ? 
  if it 's about democracy , free speech and rule of law , i see no reason to back current polish government . 
  the refugee quota issue might be another thing . 
  however , macron 's statements about `` social dumping '' are absurd . 
  how the hell should cee ever catch up to west if it is not allowed to have * any * competitive advantages ? 
   not so much erm finnish . 
  i know right . 
  they should sing in a proper language like estonian . 
  i see now that as portugal has won euro 2016 and eurovision 2017 , it 's time to start shitting on them again . 
  i heard the scandal was even discussed in spanish parliament ? 
  there sure is a shift away from the typical europop . 
  not necessarily a bad thing . 
  you ca n't be a proper european country unless you have at least this one neighbour you need to beat at everything . 
  i wonder how big is portuguese ego right now as they won and spain was last ... 
  televotes would n't have saved them anyway . 
  belgium was estonians ' favourite in televote , though . 
  the national broadcaster must have its programs translated into estonian by law . 
  estonians are traditionally fans of sweden , though . 
  i think we 've given them the most points in total ( maybe russia tops it , but that 's because of the diaspora votes ) . 
  so what do you like about t\u0113rbata ? 
  i know . 
  why is everybody so against us ? 
  we 're just as musical and beautiful ... 
  i feel it 's going to be southern european circlejerk this time . 
  not that i 'd be against bulgaria or portugal hosting it for the first time , or italy in a very long time . 
   our enemies love those weaken us like gorbachev and yeltsin and hate those that make us stronger and better like putin . 
  yes , it certainly did n't have anything to do with ... you know , estonians getting away from ussr without a single casualty after having been occupied for half a century and having our ethnic composition forcefully changed . 
  just take a loot at yugoslavia to understand what could have happened . 
  but sure , we do n't care about such petty stuff as long as we see a weak russia . 
  that 's what we live for ... / s, 
  okay , so assuming you 're more knowledgeable on this , do you think nearly a billion euros is worth it ? 
  and not only for us , russia also needs to invest as much and kaliningrad will probably become an isolated region . 
  well , what a flop for all the baltics and finland . 
  probably did n't help that we did n't even have a single neighbour in this semi . 
  might we leave russia out for once from this stuff ? 
  yes !, 
   but simply commemorate the dead , not all 20 millions of which were the bad guys ? 
  would be very fine for me , i would go lay flowers myself . 
  too bad the event is exploited for pro-putinist/pro-ussr sentiments . 
  i 'd still expect more of a discussion full of arguments , rather than the current chidlish whacking . 
  why are n't such comments removed ? 
  honestly , how is it okay to belittle entire group of countries like that ? 
  i thought that belonged to / r/russia ? 
  honestly , we are aware that there 's sometimes lack of seeing things from others ' perspective , and that includes some people in baltics portraying ussr as some evil monster , even though it did contribute a lot ( the most ) to wwii victory . 
  especially considering they did fight for their very existence . 
  it 's necessary to at least try to respect that . 
  at the same time , it 's also necessary to distinguish that from ussr itself and not start glorifying the stalinist regime . 
  but comments like from / u/abidasiii are something i 'm used to in russian political talk shows ( note : they literally scream such simplistic propagandistic statements to others ' faces ) . 
  edit : well , thank you for that . 
  everybody can criticize different aspects of different subjects if they want , but that should be in a civilized manner . 
  i would like to get some sources for these claims , preferably not from russian ones . 
  especially considering i 've also heard something similar to `` even germans considered it barbaric how estonians/latvians/lithuanians / ukrainians etc murdered their jews '' . 
  it 's the typical talk about how `` coincidentally '' the political enemies of kremlin are all some nazi-fascist scum by nature that everyone should hate . 
  also , ussr did a favour by oppressing them . 
  wow , i 'm so jealous of the southern weather . 
  [ here 's ] ( http://f12.pmo.ee/auzg0f4vho8svpnal1ati9zwvs0=/fit-in/1980x1980/filters:no_upscale\\ ( \\ ) / nginx/o/2017 / 05/09/6639663t1hf36a . jpg ) how it looked like in kuressaare , saaremaa island , estonia today . 
  ( yes , that 's real ), 
   this make me so fucking mad .

  public opinion does n't take baltics back from russia , it might save the next countries or not , if public opinion changes in couple of years again . 
  without usa nato does n't even have any capabilities to retake lost countries but usa is a country that is quite far away from europe and that 's why is it improtant that european countries would spend more on military , so that they would not depend on usa so much and could do something themselves too . 
  fighting with russia is not a mali mission or bombing libya ( when missiles ran out for european countries : / ) . 
  some of the eu leaders are protectionist as well , but on the scale of eu . 
  actually eu is very protectionist . 
  europe is and has been screwing with these companies for ages now . 
  it is a matter of time until usa responds to that . 
  i watched the trumps speech and i did n't get what was there to laugh about it . 
  seems immature as well . 
  they declared war and nothing happened . 
  that 's the reason why they call it phoney war . 
  politicans talk different things to estonians and russians in estonia because we do n't read and watch same media . 
  considering how russia talks constantly about how they are encircled by the world and that someone will try to attack them at any moment then i am not sure about who is really paranoid . 
  west is not going to start a nuclear war over baltics with russia , i am more than sure about it . 
  we need to have conventional forces in baltic states to make sure that russia does n't even think about attack baltic states because only conventional forces work as a deterrence . 
  they wo n't stop at netflix , that 's for sure . 
  i do n't want to kill european media . 
  i watch estonian tv shows , listen to estonian radio shows ( i do n't even listen to foreign radio ) and estonian movies all the time and all that without quotas . 
  it 's up to consumers what they want to listen and watch . 
  i ca n't stand goverments together with lobbyists forcing things on people . 
  i already know what 's the next step . 
  seeing how some countries in the european union want social media to delete everything that it seems as hate speech globally then soon europe is going to ask companies like netflix to so show european content globally which obviously would n't work considering that there are like 200 countries in the world and if everyone started to make demands then ... 
  i imagine that you can find these `` new '' movies under the category eurotrash . 
  next thing we have is that european productions have to move to usa to show movies there . 
  horrible . 
  i wonder why there has been no public discussion about it ? 
  i have n't heard sh * t about it estonia . 
  i am totally against these quotas and i only learned about them afterwards . 
  if you are forcing netflix to project your culture with quotas then you do n't have culture projection . 
  ca n't escape tv lobbyists . 
  not so good for me because i actually like action movies with things happening ( explosions , nice action scenes , good effects - entertainment ) not some dramatic monologues or love stories that european companies are producing . 
  but russia belives that they can capture territories without mad because they know that west does n't want to destroy the world either . 
  in the current state of things the one who makes the move first has an advantage . 
  fixed it . 
  yes but what happens next ? 
  this is not enough force to stop an attack and europe is not strong enough to counter-attack and recapture lost territory . 
  ca n't dream of a permament working contract ? 
  the reality is that under the current laws many people ca n't even get a job . 
  that 's what they want us to belive but unless the next step of efficiency is cutting wages then there is simply not enough money . 
  also i do n't know how creating more bureaucracy is going to increase efficiency to be honest because even with these central hq 's and commands the national ones will remain . 
  spending efficiently is just a buzzword because it is not a new termin and everytime countries cut their military spending they say something about `` it 's not how much you spend but how you spend '' `` more efficiency is the key '' but in reality military capabilites have deteriorated . 
  there is no substitute to money . 
  i am more than sure enough that joint eu defense policy will be used as an excuse to cut spending even more . 
  edit : sorry about multiple posts everybody . 
  my phone did n't respond so i smashed the submit button .

  there are but they are token deployments . 
  here are like 1000 british soldiers in estonia together with some french soldiers who will leave when danes arrive + couple of hundred us soldiers . 
  they all are here through nato not eu . 
  i think that was the point that he tried to make . 
  indeed but hq is a good deterrent as well . 
  unfortunately i do n't think europe is going to ever send anything more than a token deployment of troops to countries here because feelings of russia  security of european memberstates bordening russia . 
  til that estonia and poland are not in the eu . 
  estonia spends 2.17 % and poland 2 % . 
  better abilities cost money so not going to happen i am afraid . 
  but is n't france too far away from russia ? 
  europe needs to set up good defense in countries near russia because it is the only way to defend these countries . 
  europe would n't be capable of retaking lost territories from enemy like russia so the best solution is to make sure that russia ca n't capture them in the first place . 
  russia is like one of the biggest threats to eu memberstates ( many of them ) so the hq ca n't be in a random european union state . 
  maybe germany because it is in a central position of the eu . 
  but unless eu `` military '' does nothing about russia threat then it is a pointless thing that serves interests of only half of the europe . 
  edit : also who cares what russia thinks about it . 
  i mean are we more concerned about building a united military that can defend all memberstates or caring about russias feelings . 
  russia does n't give a sh * t about what their enemies think about them and neither does usa but we in europe are concerned about feelings and sensitivities of our potential enemies ( i do n't mean usa as a potential enemy ) . 
  we have to increase budget nevertheless because management costs have been cut a lot during the crisises as well so this is all slimmed down already . 
  even if we put all memberstates budgets together it would not be enough to cover the costs of current equipment that all memberstates have and it wo n't be enough for future purchases either . 
  there has been lots of discussion in this subreddit about european union laws regarding internet and social media . 
  for example : https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/69y8u9/dear_europe_please_dont_kill_free_speech_in_the/ i can keep posting them if you want . 
  i just do n't like the approach european union is taking because it is obivous where it leads . 
  i am actually worried about free speech and the point of my post was that unfortunately we are moving in the same direction . 
  uk is a bit ahead of the rest of the europe in controlling internet and i do n't want similar things to happen in the eu . 
  i am not anti-european but the opposite . 
  just because i want eu to take a different approach to free speech does n't mean i am against the eu . 
  i 'm just strongly pro-free speech . 
  you replacing words hateful with illegal does n't change anything because anything can be deemed as illegal by goverments . 
  saying bad things about communist party might be illegal in china but it does n't mean that it should be illegal . 
  austria wants it 's hate speech laws to be implemented globally and that 's a problem . 
  but european countries are moving in the same direction because they ( other countries besides austria as well in this case ) want social media sites and search engines to delete things that they do n't like or find hateful . 
  is n't this problematic ? 
  i fear that we are moving in the direction when soon opposing political views and opinions are viewed as hateful . 
  european countries are coming up with new laws all the time . 
  for example just last week there was a post in this sub about new austrian laws according to which facebook must delete globally everything that is hate speech in austria . 
  the main problem is that we are having similar developments in the european union as well . 
  one of the examples are very vague hate speech rules that goverments can use to make social media sites delete every post that they do n't like . 
  we are not at the chinese level but each year , step by step , we are getting closer there . 
  military spending works with inertia so even if you start to spend more now it may take more than a decade to even start to feel the effects of spending more . 
  effects of the european underfunding will reveal themselves in the future because we will now lag behind and this gap is not so easy to make up . 
  i am not sure if it is america overspending or europe underspending . 
  european defense expenditures are at historical lowpoint at the moment . 
  i hope that something like that does n't happen as well but before 2013 i did n't even belive that annexation of crimea was a possibility . 
  i just hope that europe would spend more money on developing conventional capabilites and place more soldiers in baltic countries so that such scenario can never happen . 
  if you look their military exercises like zapad next one is in this september ) and kavkaz then they think that such scenario will work in eastern europe . 
  they have different plans for different regions and enemies . 
  so what would your response be should scenario that i described above happen ?

  legalize weed ( the whole chain ) , prostitution , euthanasia , decriminalize other drugs . 
  legalize gay marriage . 
  foreign : i think we are fine . 
  hard to tell really . 
  from estonian pool , former president lennart meri perhaps , and composer arvo p\u00e4rt . 
  estonians in general are not into worshiping people at all . 
  thank you for the link . 
  i got my info about the early retirement issue from the blog and interviews of varoufakis , where he stated it was a big problem that he was about to tackle . 
  the data you showed indicates that it is also an issue in some other european countries like france and italy . 
  as their financial situation is not as dire at the moment when compared to greece , they probably could afford it as of now , but they also have to reform the system in the near future if they have n't done it already ( i am not 100 % up to date with the pension systems around europe ) . 
  there is also another massive problem with the third chart - it divides the total money spent on pensions with the number of 65 + people while there in fact is a massive problem with early retirements . 
  they even admit to it to it in the note in the end , dunno why they still posted this bogus chart to mislead people . 
  also , the average old age pension is well over 800 $ per month in greece by official statistics , in estonia it is roughly 350 $ while our gdp per capita is higher . 
  now , i am not saying that ours is the optimal level and greeks should also pay as little as that , but their current levels are clearly unsustainable . 
  [ that 's how un sees it ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_nations_statistical_divisions_for_europe ) . 
  pretty accurate i would say . 
  leader of the centre-right , liberal reform party , which is similar to fdp of germany , libdems of uk or vvd of the netherlands . 
  35 years old , studied economics , unmarried , cohabiting with an estonian pop singer . 
  became pm last year , forming a coalition with social democrats , won elections in march this year and formed a new coalition with social democrats and conservatives ( named union of pro patria and res publica ) . 
  his first government passed civil unions law , which among other thing allows same sex couples to register their partnership , which was opposed by a majority of people living in estonia , mostly the russian minority and the elderly . 
  his second government has also raised taxes on gasoline , alcohol , tobacco , also vat on hotels , and decreased payroll taxes + increased child benefits , which have also been politically controversial . 
  other topics on the government agenda are decreasing the number of municipalities as well as civil servants . 
  in general , his new government has had quite rocky start , with his party trailing in the polls , but i personally prefer him over ansip , the previous pm from the reform party , even though i am not a supporter of the party . 
  wonderful . 
  per scientific consensus , gmo foods are just as safe as conventional ones and usually cheaper too . 
  the whole common agricultural policy should be dismantled and borders should be open for all agricultural products from outside eu . 
  do n't understand the rationale for agricultural protectionism , it does not make much economic sense to me . 
  also , the money currently allocated for cap could be better used for r&d , infrastructure projects , erasmus + programme etc. 
  and just now deputy prime minister of greece yannis dragasakis hinted that the referendum might not take place at all , and that greek government is willing to compromise further on labour and pension issues to get the third bailout . 
  i think this is a positive development in terms of getting somewhere and putting the issue to bed , but the tactics of the greek government are quite puzzling to me . 
  i 'd say it is a good thing . 
  it is an internal matter for each country how many refugees or other kind of immigrants they think it is right to take in , and that should not be decided on european level . 
  but eu financial-material assistance should also be given for border control of italy and greece as they get most of the burden . 
  and ecthr should not bully them if they do n't let in those refugees / economic migrants who are taking the boat from countries that are relatively safe , while financially supporting organized crime that makes that way of travelling possible . 
  also , more should be done by eu to resolve the crises in libya and syria etc , so that there would less people in real danger for life and thus having legitimate grounds for refugee status, 
  | from that kind of perspective one could argue that saint petersburg is n't a historically russian city please elaborate . 
  are you really claiming that narva and saint petersburg have the same degree of `` russianity '' ? 
  nah , true that russia temporarily got control over it during the livonian war ( in 1558 ) , but they did lost it in 1581 , well before the time of troubles begun . 
  i do n't see how this 23 year rule would gives any legitimacy to call it a russian city . 
  what ? 
  narva has always been a part of estonia or terra mariana / old livonia etc , it was also one of the hansaetic cities during the middle ages and so on . 
  the idea that it was given to estonia by bolsheviks as a gift / out of `` good will '' while being a russian city is ludicrous . 
  from aug to jun this year i studied in germany as per erasmus + programme . 
  my total budget was like 11000 $ ( ~ 4500 from erasmus , 2200 $ for my master thesis ( it was commissioned ) , 600 $ for good grades in last estonians semester , ~ 1800 $ as extra scholarship , i also took a ~ 1900 $ student loan just in case ) . 
  i still have over 2000 $ from that bank account left , so i spent roughly 900 $ per month . 
  out of that 326 $ per month was for rent , 100-200 $ for food and alcohol , i also took two trips , one to portugal and the other to croatia / bosnia & herzegovina , both were little over 500 $ i think , plus smaller ones to oktoberfest , z\u00fcrich , berlin for new year 's , black forest , football games etc , i also had to fly back to estonia for a conference one time , many student parties also had entry fees . 
  considering all that i think i was quite responsible financially and still have a buffer of money left to have options before i make up my mind in terms of what to do next . 
  narva is not a historically russian city , it became one with the population transfers of the soviet union in order to `` integrate '' estonia better to the ussr and thus weaken the support for independence . 
  needless to say , it did not work . 
  still , i 'd say estonian government should do more to integrate the people of narva ( and ida-virumaa , maardu etc ) in general so they would feel more identification with and loyalty to estonia , not russia . 
  i 'd say it would be good in terms of security , economics , and ethics . 
  the article also mentioned the textile factory ( kreenholm ) closing . 
  well , that is due to the effects of globalization , estonia can not compete with the salaries in bangladesh for the textile sector , and i do n't think we should . 
  but ida-virumaa , the county where narva is , is not as economically depressed as the article would indicate , it is around the middle of estonian counties by gdp per capita . 
  it has much industry and energy production etc. 
  http://www.thelocal.dk/20150618/live-denmark-goes-to-the-polls - and another poll puts red up one seat when the northatlantic vote comes in . 
  i guess you danes are up for a long night !, 
  so the first exit polls indicate narrow blue win - http://politiken.dk/indland/politik/folketingsvalg2015/ece2718937/live-foelg-valgaftenen-minut-for-minut/ how reliable are they generally considered to be in denmark ? 
  89-86 to blue is super close though , especially considering that red is likely to get 3 from northatlantic while blue gets only one , making 90-89 seats ratio right ? 
  as a centrist social liberal i think i would vote for social democrats in the elections . 
  it appears to me as an outsider that helle has done a pretty good job as pm , getting many important reforms through with bipartisan support , and it seems like she is a stronger leader than lars . 
  another problem with the blue bloc is the fact that danish people 's party is a major player in it , i mean i could live with mainstream centre-right , but i have a low tolerance for those right-populist parties in europe . 
  even though most polls indicate blue has 1-2 point lead , the fact that christian democrats wo n't make the parliament and that 3 out of 4 north atlantic seats would support red bloc make them a slight frontrunner , right ? 
  i did read the article . 
  yes , it is about local elections in dresden . 
  but you can not claim that pegida is just a dresden thing , and that it has no significance for the rest of germany . 
  i mean , the rise of the movement has been one of the most discussed political developments in the last six months in germany , and i guess there is at least 5-10 % of population who would vote for a right-populist party like that nationwide if they would have an organization for that , as currently this hole in the political spectrum is not filled even though there seems to be a demand for that . 
  for myself , who has centre-left , social-liberal views , it is of course bad news . 
  it was only matter of time until germany had themselves an right-wing populist , anti-immigration/islam party of political significance . 
  france has fn , dutch have pvv , uk has ukip , denmark has dpp , hungary has jobbik , sweden has sd , greeks have golden dawn etc. 
  i expect them to make the next bundestag , but i hope other parties will agree not to cooperate with them . 
  i guess it is due to us being quite vocal about the threat of russia in the european institutions , which also might make other eu member states to be more skeptical of what russia is doing . 
  on the other hand , i think lithuania is even more vocal about those matters , so it is a little strange that we are considered more harmful on that front . 
  very much would welcome finland ( and sweden ) in nato . 
  hope they make it happen !, 
  i think estonia should be cut into two regions , the capital region and the rest , as there are big differences between the two in terms of economic development/performance . 
  and for the budget framework 2021 + it should be taken into account when distributing regional funds from the eu . 
  by current growth rates and current regional structure we would be ineligible for any regional money from that point on , but the `` rest of estonia '' would clearly be eligible by the logic of traditions of the eu . 
  undoubtedly the best composer of all times . 
  i mean , how could you compete with [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jm1os4vztga ) for example ? 
  [ tabula rasa ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hon4aswpvk ) is my favorite , and probably also the most acclaimed of his works . 
  one of the most important works of classical music from the second half of xx century for sure . 
  in europe as a whole the outlook is quite positive though as a result of some fundamental reasons : ( 1 ) euro is weak , ( 2 ) ecbs qe program , ( 3 ) oil is cheap , ( 4 ) interest rates are close to 0 % . 
  i hope our current substandard economic performance is a temporary issue . 
  those policies tend to raise the salaries of employees and bring the unemployment down , at least in the long run . 
  how 's that not in the interest of workers ? 
  also , in what world exactly is there no correlation between overspending and austerity ? 
  no need to cut the deficit if that is small or perfectly manageable . 
  structural reforms = / = austerity , even though there is some overlap between those concepts . 
  my ideal package of structural reforms would include increasing labor market flexibility , cutting government waste , raising retirement age , battling tax avoidance & corruption , and increasing spending on infrastructure as well as research & development , among other things . 
  i 'm not a big fan of austerity , but when government has been living outside its means for decades , it might be the only thing to do , though it might deepen recession in the short term . 
  https://pbs.twimg.com/media/ce39lmoweaaww5s.jpg nice to see that growth is picking up in europe , the data from france and italy being especially encouraging . 
  sad to see greece still in recession , and while the high student performance indicates that the future is bright for estonia , when compared to 2014 q4 , we are in recession . 
  annual figures still on the positive side though , but the trend is negative . 
  more structural reforms needed , quite obvious that they are working in countries like italy , france , spain and uk . 
  so both valls and renzi , but also cameron and rajoy deserve credit . 
  in germany , riding the growth wave due to agenda 2010 seems to be finally over . 
  very cool . 
  as said in the beginning of the video , success of school system today determines the economic outlook for the future . 
  makes it seem that we might as well be heading towards a more affluent , productive society .

  do n't you see a discrepancy between the two ? 
  well , of course , gdp per capita shows it rather indirectly . 
  sending out former illegal occupiers to their indigenous land is not a human rights violation . 
   for example kadriorg park was build by the peter the great , using that logic still belong to russia . 
  please , do n't embarrass yourself . 
   racist who want to deport estonians citizens ( including women and children ) when did i say that ? 
   ( as they are estonians and not russian citizens ) quite many are indeed russian citizens . 
   no one will agree with you . 
  most people in estonia will agree with me . 
  we have been bullied way too much in history for us to be played around by russians again . 
   their votes will count even more that 's disgusting . 
  they have no right to change estonia 's future in a pro-russian way !, 
   there will be mayor of tallinn who is of ethnic russian background we already have a pro-russian mayor ... 
  in our independent country ... you think this is right ? 
  would you support warsaw or paris having a german nazi mayor had the germans remained in poland or france ? 
   one day the pm will be a russian speaker , and there is nothing you can do to change it . . and you think this is right ? 
  that 's disgusting that you think so . 
  you seem to possess no knowledge how much the russians have hurt us and what many of them think about independent estonia . 
  how can you support them ? 
   `` a slave paints a painting , and dies and so does the owner of the slave . 
  the child of that slave , in later years , becomes a free man . 
  who owns that painting ? 
  the descendant of the slave owner or the descendant of the slave '' nations have collective consciousness . 
  ethnic groups have a right to self determination . 
  do not forget that , you pro-russian imperialist !, 
   ethnic groups do n't think at all , because it is known that humans do not possess a hivemind . 
  same reason why you ca n't blame all germans for the holocaust , or all muslims for some gang rapes or whatever . 
  for christ 's sake , you got what i mean !, 
  if 95 % of an ethnic group a thinks in a direction b and 95 % of an ethnic group c thinks in direction d , then they do n't suit together well !, 
   russia ca n't import anyone or anything into your country anymore , and that 's a good thing . 
  ca n't right now does n't mean ca n't in the future . 
  if they were to occupy the country again , would you be supporting the flooding of estonia with russian colonists and later claiming they have rights to get citizenship in re-independent estonia ? 
  thing is , those `` accepted russians '' were not accepted at all , they came during a time , when estonians were not able to give the acceptance . 
   ethnic groups do n't possess a consciousness . 
  collective consciousness - ** of course they do !, 
  ** i ca n't believe you are defending forceful assimilation of ethnic groups , that 's disgusting for me that you 'd think so . 
  did i mention estonia wants to send its citizens out ? 
  but not all of them are citizens ... 
  are they growing 10 % per year now ? 
  how dare they put up a missile defense system that can stop our nukes !, 
  what about us ? 
  that 's actually not a simple issue . 
  i do n't think europeans are so radical , but as long as european mainstream political parties wo n't take a more anti-immigrant stance , the far right parties will grow in popularity . 
  it 's amazing if people make decisions based on how loud a couple of people can yell . 
  oh indeed , though it does n't mean it will crash the economy , though it will crash the growth . 
  `` the sole '' was not meant in absolute terms , but still , all the other reasons for joining nato are relatively irrelevant if compared to the main reason ... closer integration with the west is for more assurances to keep away from russia :d, 
  indeed , but this did n't start in 2011 ... 
  i did n't know we were talking in absolute terms ... ca n't think of any other sound reason for estonia 's participation in nato than to seek its protection against russia . 
  it quite is for the baltic states , poland and finland ... 
   reason any of russia 's neighboring states, 
  the sole reason any of russia 's neighboring states have joined or are considering joining nato , is ... russia itself . 
   you want a proof of south korea and taiwan backed by us ? 
  its their history . 
  korean war , masrhall plan , whole united nations operations in taiwan . 
  you either misunderstood or you are doing this on intention . 
  i wanted you to prove that the reason taiwan and south korea grew was because of us money , while in reality it was because they organized a good capitalist system . 
  and the arab states grow because of oil . 
  just the point is , that democracy is not something endemic to rich countries and there are plenty of rich countries that are not democracies . 
  ok , population growth - we were arguing about the effects of population on economic development , not the effects of population growth of economic development . 
   flowing money from usa really helps . 
  proof ? 
   there are so much you can do with you population . 
  there may be not a hard cap but there is definetly a soft cap exists . 
  again , zero evidence . 
  it 's like claiming 4 people have an easier time cooking for 4 than 8 people have cooking for 8 . 
  bigger growth before the recession usually means bigger decline during the recession . 
  it 's about long term stable growth - if you grow too quickly , it 's often a sign of an economic bubble . 
  understood , but as i said ( and which you should have answered to ) , there is no such ethnic group called the `` balkan people '' , but there are people called `` baltic people '' , which do n't include estonians . 
   this is wrong . 
  most of the dictotarships suffers economicly . 
  really ? 
  formerly both south korea and taiwan were not democracies , but were doing really well . 
  so are the arab gulf states . 
  then again you can find poor democracies as well . 
  there is no correlation between being a democracy and being rich , not a negative correlation , not a positive one . 
   per capita is relevent with the population . 
  but your claim was that it 's harder to grow in per capita with a population of over 1 billion . 
  i do n't see how it 's any easier for a nation of 1 million , as there are that much fewer people contributing to the growth . 
  that 's why it 's called per capita , it eliminates the difference of population . 
  ugh , and they claim estonians are slow :d and this was not about any recession as there was no recession in 2007 . 
  they are both important - one for international leverage , the other for your own wealth . 
  the discussion here was about china 's capability to grow , which if far more difficult for already richer nations , which china may eventually become . 
   fundamentalist protestants ok , that 's a particularly irish thing :d, 
   with the population of over 1 billion it is really hard isnt it ? 
  size is absolutely irrelevant in gdp growth . 
   but they are doing overhelmingly good considering the one party system and with that many citizens . 
  being a democracy or a dictatorship is absolutely irrelevant in gdp growth . 
  nope , but mosques and imams quite often are , and they still have influence over any religious muslim , whether a fundamentalist or not . 
  i only know some tatars , as they form the biggest muslim community in estonia . 
  tatars are however relatively moderate muslims . 
  they are economically very relevant now already . . 
   their 1 % growth will be more than estonia 200 % . 
  it 's been years since i 've encountered an argument as dumb as this . 
  besides , with china , you are comparing gdp growths , but with germany , you seem to be comparing gdp per capita growths . 
  gdp does n't show wealth , it shows the size of the economy . 
  gdp per capita shows wealth . 
  thing is , modern catholics are n't so tied to churches as muslims are to mosques and their fundamentalist views . 
  but not as long to actually surpass developed nations in gdp per capita . . 
  how quaint . 
  often people overestimate china 's capacity to grow forever and claim they 'll overgrow europe or the us in per capita terms because you know . . they grow 10 % a year .

  - [ * laul p\u00f5hjamaast * ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhd4u8imwq0 ) ( `` song of the northern/nordic country/land '' ) late soviet or singing revolution era , which produced most of our patriotic songs : - [ * eesti muld ja eesti s\u00fcda * ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hdhit9d8_4 ) ( `` the estonian soil and the estonian heart '' ) - [ * eestlane olen ja eestlaseks j\u00e4\u00e4n * ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fe-dxvmomb8 ) ( `` i am an estonian and i will always be an estonian '' ) - [ * ei ole \u00fcksi \u00fckski maa * ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r75wmx1wfgk ) ( `` no country is alone '' ) - [ * ilus maa * / * maa tuleb t\u00e4ita lastega * ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm4ec01u0-4 ) ( `` beautiful land '' / `` the land needs to be filled with children '' ) - [ * isamaa ilu hoieldes * ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-fstanmniy ) ( `` withholding the beauty of the fatherland '' ) - [ * koit * ] ( https://youtu.be/bts4jvkxvmi?t=0m45s ) ( `` dawn '' ) - [ * palve * ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjimfydpuqo ) ( `` prayer '' ) - [ * sind surmani * ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=padzosjdps4 ) ( `` you until death '' ) - [ * \u00c4rkamise aeg * ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckzsxhpvqtm ) ( `` time of awakening '' ) recent : - [ * mis maa see on * ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmmuoplqnls ) ( `` what land is it '' ), 
   i should look more into estonian humor , it seems . 
  well , i doubt you have all the time it takes . 
  yes , a lot of stupid things were done just because they wanted to differ from the soviet era . 
   the usage of random english words , especially if they 're american slang . 
  i think in slang it 's pretty much normal and that 's how language evolves . 
  words like * fain * ( `` fine '' ) , * chill * , * f\u00e4\u00e4nsi * ( `` fancy '' ) may sound good or bad , but at least some of them will remain in the language and therefore make it richer . 
  i have a lot more problems in business and official language , where at meetings people have difficulties translating every internationally known word into your own language quickly and then use the english term instead . 
   do n't think that is actually american it is n't . 
  but it was implemented here in the 1990s as a lame try to make our military look more like the american military . 
   midsummer coming up and it 's raining . 
  \\ #traditionalmidsummer, 
  absolutely agreed , but that 's why i do n't see how op could be pleased right now . 
  winters are warmer and with less snow and more rain . 
  the rest of the year sees too much rain as well . 
  military chaplains . 
  when i was in the army , they wore stupid semi-religious garments and held semi-religious `` inspirational '' speeches . 
  they are supposed to talk in the name of all religions , so they try to look neutral , but they are almost unilaterally lutherans . 
  it all sounded ridiculous to the mostly irreligious estonians , who were forced to listen to it . 
  say what you want and people will treat you for it as they see fit . 
  only in the context of some us or british movies or tv shows . 
  i know that feet are shorter than meters and pounds smaller than kilograms , but that 's about it . 
  i 've no idea what weird unconventional system of degrees the fahrenheit scale uses . 
  / edit : yes , we do use inches for monitor diameters for some reason , but i still do n't know how much an inch really is . 
  for fringe social science research purposes ? 
   clean-shaven i see i have no business here . 
  mainstream beer companies are regional , saku is popular in northern estonia , while a. le coq is popular in southern estonia , especially in the southeast around tartu . 
  nobody really knows . 
  one possible source is the national abbreviation lv ( often seen on latvian cars ) , where it 's supposed to mean '' ** l ** isa ** v ** arvas '' ( extra toe ) . 
  also because there is a stereotype about latvians wearing socks with sandals to hide out their extra toe . 
  june 14 is the day of mourning and commemoration , which commemorates the victims of the [ 1941 and 1949 soviet deportations to siberia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/soviet_deportations_from_estonia ) . 
  august 23 is the european day of remembrance for victims of stalinism and nazism . 
  which commemorates the victims of both regimes after the 23 august 1939 molotov -- ribbentrop pact . 
  ugh , such shitty political views ... 
  it 's a ** very common ** estonian joke about latvians . 
  it 's still the other side of the gulf . 
  i get mistaken for an historian a lot , although i studied law . 
  this seems to be the fringe consensus among right-wing populists here as well . 
  indigenous central american cultures have always been an interest of mine . 
  i have some baltic german ancestry . 
  well , it 's not like anyone does n't here . 
  oh indeed , later age of first child is a rather recent development everywhere . 
  no , it was a soviet-imposed social thing to have children so early and not having children by what would be considered normal now , was somewhat stigmatized . 
  mother 20 , father 23 . 
  it was common to have children that young until the late soviet era . 
  sommer solstice is huge in the entire northern europe . 
   so if the objective standard for being scandinavian is speaking a scandinavian language then that means iceland is a scandinavian country . 
  by many means it is . 
  it 's just that in the modern context `` scandinavian '' has gotten a rather exclusive meaning as iceland is rather distanced from the others . 
  that 's why scandinavian and north germanic are considered separate terms . 
  but [ insular scandinavian ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/north_germanic_languages ) is still often distinguished . 
   yes , finland does have strong historic ties to what you would accept as scandinavia . 
  so do many other places . 
   finland used to be a part of sweden . 
  so was tobago . 
  is it scandinavia ? 
   i acknowledged that even in what you consider to be scandinavia , it does technically include greenland and the faroe islands because they are denmark . 
  belonging to a country does not make them part of the same [ exact ] cultural region . 
  well at least the stereotype is , 
   nordic bronze age doubt this has anything to do with what is considered nordic in the modern context . 
  the meteorite impact that created the [ kaali crater ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kaali_crater ) may just have been the only major meteorite impact ever that has ever happened in a populated area . 
  it survived in estonian and finnish mythology and may have given the basis for several ancient greek legends ( although the latter may be a bit of a stretch ) . 
  plus people know very few uralic languages so they usually think they must be alike . 
  it was the runescape account of my friend . 
  it got hacked , i saw it somewhere online in about 2003 and traded it back . 
  my friend let me keep it and i 've used the username ever since . 
  since the a in happy pronounces like \u00c4 in estonian , and \u00c4 is or at least was often replaced by 2 in internet speak when umlauts were n't available , then he wrote it as h2ppyme . 
   okay , what is the objective standard that says denmark is scandinavian ? 
  it speaks a scandinavian language . 
   because , from what i gather , the argument is that because it has strong historic ties to sweden & norway it 's a part of the region . 
  yes . 
   however , so does finland no . 
   iceland having been a part of denmark . 
  danish west indies would n't be considered to be part of scandinavia just because it 's under danish rule . 
  plus , lots of other places have been under danish rule and you do n't seem to count them as part of scandinavia . 
   surely that 's a very subjective call , is it not ? 
   those who include other countries lack knowledge yes , yes it does . 
  because they lack an argument . 
   that standard is subjective no , it is not . 
  linguistics is science and scandinavia is a cultural region very clearly tied with linguistic similarity . 
  unless they are some orthodox jews ( which is almost never the case here ) , you definitely can not tell the difference . 
  only some have very recent middle eastern ancestry to make their appearance stick out , but this is rather a stereotype than an actual occurrence . 
  plus they are very integrated so you definitely ca n't distinguish them by their accent . 
  with german i 'd say i understand at least basic written dutch , which is quite cool . 
  my experience from learning at least some russian is that it does n't help understanding ukrainian at all , let alone any western or southern slavic languages . 
  if you take the [ wikitongues example ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxrcnf8utse ) of finnish , then i understand more than 50 % . 
  but i 'm of a certain age group , who has watched at least some finnish television in his childhood , and who is from tallinn , which sees lots of finnish tourists . 
  hungarian is a whole different story though , i would n't say i understand anything at all - it 's like comparing english and albanian . 
   this is not accurate . 
  the encyclopedia britannica acknowledges some authorities consider finland ( as well as iceland ) to be a part of scandinavia . 
  some `` authorities '' may consider that , but purely out of total lack of knowledge . 
   there is n't an objective standard yes there is , you are just mixing up scandinavia and the scandinavian peninsula . 
   there are valid reasons to include finland & iceland in that category . 
  iceland , perhaps , but there 's `` northern germanic '' for that .

  roughly , but this is still not a direct correlation . 
  both democratic and undemocratic countries can be corrupted , it 's just that the trend is favoring democratic countries in this aspect . 
  why would an unmarried couple get more benefits than a married couple ? 
  is every unmarried parent really considered a `` single parent '' ? 
  most of the hiv is in starkly russian areas in northeastern estonia . 
  latvia is more mixed anyway , there are n't such strong russian majority regions in latvia . 
  nice victim of russian propaganda . 
  russians came here illegally - they deserve no special rights . 
  how the hell did i comment here ... 
  good pisa results will be the end of us !, 
  marriage is of christian conspiracy !, 
  are n't they outside schengen and eurozone areas like the uk ? 
  i understood that `` yesterday '' was a moving holiday . 
  i 'm pretty sure 60 % of rape is not done by 6 % of the population , i.e. 
   6 % of sweden 's population ca n't be rapists . 
  if he meant that a small ethnic group or collection of ethnic groups contains 60 % of rape perpetrators , then that 's another thing . 
  i blame the left-wing media for hiding the truth and the right-wing media for inventing facts . 
  i wish both biased sides would use these wings to fly the fuck away ... 
  first pisa , now this ? 
  i feel like they 're utterly unrelated , but who cares , we 're first !, 
  forgetting the soviet occupation ? 
  if you want to join now , denmark , then you need to change that flag . 
  it was a schr\u00f6dinger 's terrorist attack . 
  at the same time it happened and it did n't happen . 
  there is just no plausible way to know for sure . 
  two things to consider : - state succession - states usually remain member states of international organizations ; - new state 's political system has to be in compliance with eu rules . 
  so in case cz and sk form a new country with a new political system , it has to be approved by the eu before they can join the union . 
  in case one country absorbs the other ( and it is recognized by eu members ) and the political system of the former remains the same , then nothing really changes except there is now one state fewer in the union ( plus reapportionment of meps etc ) . 
  / this is just a guess based on my understanding of state succession , which sounds logical in theory . 
  the ossuary was spectacular - one of the most interesting places i have visited . 
  it 's not a problem as many of the students will also be estonians . 
  wait . . 
  do you think it 's smart to base your analysis on rumors ? 
  which is sort of an important factoid that some people conveniently forget to excuse stalin 's actions . 
  i think we should rather have courses on sarcasm . 
  oh of course not . 
  even his iq , which is often brought up as a comparison for anyone really smart today , was nothing exceptional . 
  erm , what ? 
  we definitely chose the right one in ... 1918 . 
  oh yeah , we do the k -  g in many grammatical cases , plus helsinki is * helsingi * in estonian due to the common pronunciation . 
  the [ ural-altaic language family ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ural\u2013altaic_languages ) is mostly thought to be a bogus theory . 
  [ of course ] ( http://2static3.fjcdn.com/comments/fingolians+descendants+of+benis+khan+d+_a5f734153dfefec780e5ffcf751ef7f5.jpg ) !, 
  you mean to tell me that there are more superior education tests to focus the curriculum on ? 
  i messed up the word , i meant grammatical cases . 
   by the way , if you are a fan of graffiti tagging , that 's fine !, 
  no judgement here !, 
  i do n't agree , but it 's reasonable to view tagging as a kind of art form , or just to like the aesthetic of it . 
  illegal graffiti is illegal and it 's not fine , whether it 's art or not . 
  i knew what i meant , considering i made that map , but indeed i used the wrong word . 
  as much as i understood from [ this comment ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/mapporn/comments/4ostb0/number_of_grammatical_cases_currently_in_use_in/d4fmu6t/ ) , they fell out of use in written dutch very recently . 
   estonia seems like a country that really has its shit together . 
  that 's really not the case . 
  we are rather a country that has a lot of its shit together , but there was an exceptional amount of shit produced for decades , so we still have a lot of it , but luckily we are fast at getting our shit together . 
   damn , what makes estonia so much better than the other baltic states ? 
  counting our many [ grammatical ~ ~ genders ~ ~ cases ] ( http://i.imgur.com/2msxnqu.png ) takes good math skills . 
  i was referring to just `` one in a billion '' geniuses . 
   what is weird is your brand of ethno-nationalism . 
  in that thread about old believers you called them immigrants despite them being there since 17th century . 
  yes , every community is an immigrant community if it 's not in its native territory . 
   typical . 
  what the hell is typical ? 
  if you do n't know anything about my country , why banter ? 
  [ these territories ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/territorial_changes_of_the_baltic_states ) and the [ treaty of tartu ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/treaty_of_tartu_\\ ( russian -- estonian \\ ) ) . 
   when the ottomans occupied kosovo , it was almost 100 % serb . 
  today it is 10 % serb . 
  who endangered who , again ? 
  do you not know that international law as such did n't really exist in the 19th century ? 
  geniuses or such famous geniuses like einstein ? 
  finnic brother to the rescue !, 
  will the higher average result really have a profound effect on finding a `` one in a billion '' genius in a nation that barely manages a million ? 
  you do understand that eastern europe is still part of `` the west '' , right ? 
  you are failing to realize it is . 
  i think you can quite legitimately hate on black people if their ancestors did something similar to your country and still glorify these actions . 
  sort of arbitrary , do n't you think ? 
   my point is that we can not act like russians in latvia have no right to call themselves russians and i do n't think anyone objects to that here - after all , we sort of exclude them from the term [ ethnic ] `` estonian '' or `` latvian '' even if they are very well integrated . 
  label themselves ethnically how they want , we really do n't mind , it 's the state affiliation to russia that bothers us . 
   the british solution to the issue of russians in latvia is for russia to annex the parts of latvia that have majority russian ethnic people . 
  well , the ussr did exactly that ... 
   when someone in northern ireland wants to claim to be irish because the irish are native to ireland ? 
  russians came here illegally during an illegal foreign occupation . 
  imagine being a frenchman in france and having to live in a region of german immigrant majority that mostly still supports hitler . 
  he may have not meant the general population per se , rather that in a war situation many of them would turn out to be a dangerous or outright criminal element and would therefore be subject to imprisonment at least . 
  that would be nothing different from any other conflict . 
  except there were no indigenous ethnic groups left there to claim them . 
  it was just soviet imperialism . 
  it 's not ... 
  better educate yourself more on the issue before making such bold accusations . 
  it 's pretty clear the situation is more complicated than just evil fascist states taking away the rights of ethnic russians ... rt has really worked on people ... 
   huh , that means that due to state succession they are stateless and second-class citizen . 
  also would n't it be against european convention on nationality ? 
  latvia have signed it latvia and estonia are successors of their 1940 states and not the respective ssrs as it was an illegal foreign occupation . 
  it was russia 's duty as the legal successor of the ussr to grant them russian citizenship . 
   they took away the citizenship/political rights of their minority upon gaining independence and require them to go through a ` naturalization ' test to become citizens . 
  it 's horrific that such a practice is still permitted within the eu . 
  horrible propaganda ... 
  they were never citizens of latvia and estonia - how could they then take it away ??? 
  it 's like nazi germany complaining that ethnic german immigrants to france `` lost their french citizenship '' after the nazis were ousted ... 
  they are a group that came here as a crime against international law . 
  a group that was supposed to create the fifth column for the ussr/russia to forever hold us tied with russia . 
  a group that murdered many of our ancestors .

  fuck the soviet union !, 
  the ussr also convinced several countries and peoples to join the axis side , who would have otherwise preferred to be neutral . 
  like estonia for example . 
   why are you choosing to blame the other side when the economic war was started by ourselves ( under pressure from overseas though ) ? 
  because the `` economic war '' was a response to russia annexing a part of ukraine . 
  what do you propose as the solution ? 
  italians , if you just build a bridge from africa to lampedusa , then all the migrants could walk over and not drown !, 
  hungary is also losing credibility in the business world . 
  recently they implemented a new tax on rtl hungary after rtl had invested a lot of money into their hungarian subdivision . 
  this tax puts a 40 % levy on rtl 's advertising revenue , which means that rtl hungary is no longer profitable . 
  no other company has to pay that much . 
  this could scare off other foreign companies from stepping foot in hungary , as it may seem like hungary has no problem looting the assets of foreign companies . 
  that 's no excuse to hate other catholics !, 
  the real question is , why do you hate catholics so much ? 
  less competition for european producers . 
  dude , like i said , you 're the one who started spouting nazi rhetoric in here . 
  get back on topic or gtfo !, 
   the bolsheviks in russia also had the `` approval '' of the jews in germany . 
  did you read that from stormfront ? 
  you 're the only one with nazi rhetoric here . 
   tell me , what is it that `` moderate '' muslims must do to satisfy you enough to counter your entirely baseless statement that they 're working in league with extremist muslims ? 
  cast out the violent ones from their society . 
  always call them out on their bullshit . 
  stage counter-protests , when they demand some caricaturist be beheaded or similar stupid thing . 
  in general , they should have a 0 tolerance policy towards the violent extremists in their own community . 
  instead those extremists have silent approval . 
  an example pls . 
   ** this idea ** that moderate muslims are responsible for what extremists do ** is exactly ** , word for word , ** what the nazis did to the jews . 
  ** nazis did an idea to the jews ? 
  makes no sense . 
  try again !, 
   did n't know muslims all shared the same hive mind and could predict what everyone is doing at every moment of the day . 
  are you saying the jewish defense league has such a hive mind , because they did manage to predict what was happening ? 
   this sounds a lot like theories nazis would say about the jews . 
  - . - http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2cl80g/muslim_mob_attack_paris_synagogue_and_got_blocked/ here 's another interesting thread about how a radical muslim mob was stopped by jewish defense league from attacking a synagogue . 
  ** tell me , why do you think they were stopped by jews , not other ( peaceful ) muslims ? 
  ** here 's how i see it : they have the silent approval of most muslims . 
   i 've read a lot of stupid things in my life ok , i wo n't judge you then - it 's not your fault you are the way you are . 
  i never said anything about `` conspiration '' . 
   the extremist minority and the non-violent ones are just pals who share roles ? 
  do n't try to put words in my mouth !, 
  edit : although i do find it hard to believe that the violent ones and the peaceful ones do n't often live under the same roof . 
  multicultural russia is attacking slavic ukraine . 
  so are you for or against slavs ? 
   and the imperialists trying to rebuild the ussr . 
  fixed . 
   `` the extremist minority ruins it for the majority of good muslims . '', 
  they 're playing the * good cop - bad cop * game . 
  one part threatens , the other claims they 're peaceful - the result is that they are feared and unchallenged . 
  i think it 's based on the russian naval jack . 
   mind you , showing up with a group of people could very well be a threat to the actual security of the person who lives there just because you feel threatened and insecure , that does n't mean it 's ok to start beating up people . 
   also , slaves do n't have the option to leave the country and denounce their citizenship , you goddamn cretin . 
  - . - i 'd be more interested in getting all the statist dogs kicked out instead . 
  no , i said forcing others to work for you , because `` you 're the majority '' is mob rule and slavery . 
  btw , for your own sake , stop putting `` lol '' everywhere , when you 're obviously mad . 
   lol . 
  til democracy = slavery . 
  quit trying to put words in my mouth !, 
  forcing others to work for you , because `` you 're the majority '' is mob rule . 
  edit : and slavery . 
   overwhelming majority fuck your mob rule !, 
   there 's a difference between forcing people ... and forcing people ... no , there is n't . 
  just because you feel threatened and insecure , that does n't mean you can force others to die for you . 
   something that someone with ` serious health issues ' does not have . 
  to be fair , serious health issues could still be temporary . 
  and if simulated , then that person could still be fit to have a security job or similar . 
  also , i do n't think not having gone through military service restricts you from getting a gun permit . 
  those tests are done separately . 
  sure , never said it is n't, 
  that 's some communist shit there . 
  forcing people to work is slavery . 
   ... learn to except multi-culturalism ... learning to get a long ... you 're not originally from britain are you ? 
  i do n't know what you guys are talking about . 
  my history channel only has boring shows about warehouses and pawn shops . 
  you 're welcome !, 
  japan , korea , ghana ... the us trains a lot of militaries worldwide . 
  ukraine is n't muslim , it 's orthodox christian . 
  what 's your point ? 
  yes , this piece of literature should not be approached literally . 
  everyone interprets it how they want . 
   two dogs in the same litter have more genetic diversity than virtually any two humans . 
  source ? 
  otherwise , i 'm going to call bullshit . 
  edit : although even if true , it 's irrelevant . 
  yeah , that 's why i made the comparison with dog breeds - it works the same way . 
  where do you draw the line between different breeds ? 
  what exactly makes a dog a `` german shepherd '' or whatever ? 
  people might say the dog 's ears are pointing up and he 's brown or something , but plenty of other dogs match that description . 
  some might even say that `` german shepherds '' are smarter than other dogs , but there are smart and dumb dogs among all breeds . 
  it 's an entirely arbitrary decision . 
   do you actually think race has some scientific basis ? 
  because it really does n't . 
  lol yeah , it 's as dumb as thinking there are different dog breeds with different traits and looks . 
  edit : and just look at all the racists downvoting me !, 
  last year russia issued an interpol warrant against an estonian politician too - no one cared . 
  20 % here, 
  well i guess i 'd like to see more than just cost for employer . 
   also i 'm curious if the countries with smaller taxes on this chart have other taxes which are higher . 
  i feel like this would tell us more with vat shown somewhere . 
  but interesting table anyway .

  the photograph serves as a sign of a society that 's ... not exactly stagnating , but not moving forward either . 
  the ` young bucks ' are more likely to exhibit violent behaviour in search of cachet if the other ways of acquiring status in a society are either severely restricted or closed off altogether . 
  best example of same is libya , where young men destined to spend their lives on the lower rungs of society took up arms en masse , partially in order to - to put it bluntly - increase their marriage outlooks ( especially in an islamic society ) . 
  which girl wants to get hitched to a nobody , which father wants one as a son-in-law ? 
  it 's another thing to be courted by an heroic revolutionary . 
  people sometimes ask `` why do they fight '' ? 
  [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/kokdepb.jpg ) seems to be as good a reason as any . 
  simply ramming the barricades with apcs , huh . 
   those left are merely people who wish the violence to continue yanuk wishes nothing more than a return to status quo , for the violence to stop and everything to return to business as usual . 
  does that make the cunt a good guy ? 
   those protesting against yan 's policies are long gone . 
  assumptions again . 
  those left are largely people who wish for a resolution of the current fuckup . 
  maybe violent , maybe nonviolent , but _ not _ business as usual . 
   they identify as center-left . 
  center-left they are then . 
  what someone self-identifies as matters about as little as the values they claim to espouse . 
  past few years ? 
  you must be lying , because the only violent civilians on the streets are the protesters . 
  bookmark the first one , gents and ladies . 
  you can use it the next time someone goes `` titushki ? 
  what titushki ? 
  not entirely , no . 
  your assumption that yanuk is somehow representative of `` the left '' is derived from your belief that his opponents are from `` the right '' . 
  do you seriously think there are no leftists on the maidan ? 
  no centrists ? 
  no liberals ? 
  always check your assumptions . 
  when you wake up , check your assumptions . 
  when you open your mouth , check your assumptions . 
  when you open a text entry box , check your assumptions . 
  because if one thing is true , it 's that someone somewhere is hard at work creating pre-packaged assumptions for you , to control you , to turn you into a tool to be used . 
   switching left wing for right wing wo n't be such a happy ending . 
  left wing ? 
  yanuk is _ left wing _ ? 
  the fuck are you smoking , dude , 
   death to fascism . . that 's the key part . 
  somewhat simplified : the state religion of ussr and later russia was and is `` the great patriotic war '' , or ww2 as the rest of the world knows it . 
  nazis were _ the _ great evil , and the soviet ( implicitly russian ) people , by soloing _ the _ great evil , proved themselves to be _ the _ good side . 
  evil people - `` fascists '' , good people - `` us '' . 
  that 's the ideology that was drilled into us back then , and is being pushed by russian state media today . 
  now , that kind of mental programming leaves one open to external influences when they co-opt the message . 
  it 's enough for those in power to point their finger at someone and go `` there 's a fascist !, 
  attack ! '', 
  and the brains of a significant subset of the population go `` run program ww2 '' . 
  there 's no subtlety , there 's no doubt , you just go and smash the fascists whoever they may be . 
  it 's like pointing at someone and calling `` there 's a terrorist !, 
  attack !, 
  '' , only more subtle and much , much more pervasive due to literally generations ' worth of brainwashing . 
  the young idiots on the web are fighting fascists . 
  the police on the ground are fighting fascists . 
  were the military to get involved , they 'd be fighting fascists . 
  once you tag someone as fascist , they stop being people . 
  those guys in helmets and camo ? 
  fascists . 
  the girls with red crosses on them ? 
  fascists . 
  the little old lady digging up paving stones ? 
  fascist . 
  random passers-by in the wrong place at the wrong time ? 
  fascists . 
  what do you do with fascists ? 
  you kill them , simple as that . 
   but they 're not little old ladies . 
  not entirely correct . 
  ( my mum was born in 1944 , when that war was still going on . 
  she survived stalin , khrushchev , brezhnev . 
  today she went to maidan with empty bottles . 
  my comment from another thread :  anyone who goes around calling people fascists willy-nilly in this day and age is either a former hardcore far leftist who 's lived in denial for the past quarter of a century , or someone whose view on the world has been formed under the guidance of russian state media during the past decade or so . 
   furthermore : it 's a sad fact , but in most of the eastern europe ( and often enough in the west ) anyone calling themselves antifascists can be with relative certainty assumed to be a part of pro-russian pressure group . 
   basically , the terms have lost all meaning apart from signifying the position those using them hold themselves . 
   a large community can have a diverse set of opinions and the democracy assumes that majority is always right . 
  that 's why modern democracies are n't outright `` dictatorships of the majority '' but have checks and balances built in . 
  disarm , then see if you 're still being attacked ? 
  what a wonderful idea . 
  it _ did not start out like this _ in syria . 
  russia and china blocked any action on syria for two fucking years after the massacres , so the victims had the time to morph into a resistance , and the resistance had time to radicalize . 
  because the only ones offering any help from outside the country during that time were the islamist nutjobs , and they slowly took over . 
   we have a civil war brewing here if they 're not careful so , send in the army ? 
  the army whose loyalties are as confused as anyone 's in the country ? 
   st petesburg/petrograd/leningrad or tallinn/reval bad examples , as the first had those names sequentially , not concurrently , and the second 's ` old ' name is n't used by anyone but the oldest people in a few countries . 
  props for two n 's in tallinn , though , 
  born in crimea , afaik . 
  his rhetoric gives him away .

  there 's a similarity in that , given the chance , russia may once again ` contain ' the situation long enough to give both sides time to radicalize , thus making supporting either of the warring sides more and more unpalatable for the westerners . 
  i wonder if same applies to the police . 
  out of 5 dead policemen who have been identified , 3 had been bussed in from donbass and crimea . 
   a journalist has also died . 
  more [ here ] ( http://vesti.ua/kiev/38221-pogib-korrespondent-vestej-vjacheslav-veremij ) ( rus ) and [ here ] ( http://www.kyivpost.com/content/kyiv/euromaidan-rallies-in-ukraine-feb-19-live-updates-337098.html ) :  vesti writes its journalist vyacheslav veremei died today early morning after he was shot by unknown men in masks on velyka zhytomyrska street last night . 
  veremei and his colleague it specialist oleksiy lymarenko were attacked when they were coming back from work on taxi . 
  the assailants pulled them and the taxi driver out of the car and brutally beat them . 
  lymarenko and the taxi driver received serious injuries . 
  -- _ anastasia forina _ vesti is more prominent in eastern part of the country , but their coverage has been relatively neutral , verging on sympathetic . 
  moomin world . 
  nope . 
  to german ear you 're still pronouncing two different vowels instead of ` a ' in ` mason ' . 
  i go by dominant usage for long periods of time , not the amount of native speakers .

  thanks for the explanation . 
  yeah , well , economically speaking , with central-eastern europe in general . 
  dubbing is unoriginal , it 's always the same voices and will not give away the needed expressions . 
  it does n't bother me at all to read the subtitles . 
  perhaps that 's why estonians are [ relatively good at english ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6c/ef_english_proficiency_index.svg/2000px-ef_english_proficiency_index.svg.png ) , compared to most other eastern europeans . 
  bratislava though , is one of the closest [ bigger ] cities to western europe in eastern europe  latvia 's problem is a far larger russian community and a relatively big influence of regional shady and possibly corrupted politicians , plus a lack of understanding about the country 's geopolitical role , as estonia has itself aligned with the nordics , and lithuania with poland , yet latvia stands in the middle with no clear view in sight . 
  communicating with latvians quite often , it always surprises me how estonians and latvians view corruption so differently . 
  while estonians are not really afraid to take down even the highest politicians on corruption ( mayor of tallinn , several coalition and opposition ministers , influential businessmen ) , latvians are more like `` what can you do ... '', 
   roscomnadzor 's newest regulations what are those ? 
  and it could also be that as wikipedia is an international webpage , it is relatively difficult for the kremlin to fight against it , as the anonymous editors will fire back quite quickly . 
   no idea about estonia though . 
  most developed ( `` exemplary '' ) republic of the soviet union ... 
  not only because of faith , but their social background , which is of course influenced by faith . 
  as someone pointed out in a previous topic , the uk has n't had many problems with pakistani muslim immigrants for example , yet more problems may arise with north and sub-saharan african and middle eastern muslim refugees . 
  in some countries , the same religion plays a larger role and their communities will not fully adapt to western societies , where they organize themselves into relatively closed sub-communities and the religious leaders continue to force their fundamentalist and often anti-european dogmas on the adherents . 
  fictional converting is irrelevant , it 's not about `` looking good on a paper '' , but being really able to change and integrate . 
  and no , i do think we should accept opposition ( democratic minded ) activists from such countries , but not people , who we know little to nothing about and not people in masses . 
  regular people fleeing war should be accepted into neighboring countries ( of which of course some are flooded with them already ) and countries with similar cultures , especially the arab states and northern africa . 
  indeed , though you can say the same about slovakia ( which is quite on top too though ) and latvia , if i 'm not mistaken . 
  of [ lynching negroes in america ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/and_you_are_lynching_negroes ) ? 
  gosh , why do you people use dubbing ? 
  `` but the west broke an [ ambiguous verbal ] agreement first by nato expanding into eastern europe ! '', 
  oh , slovenia , czech republic and estonia strong . 
  i do wonder , whether these three topping almost every list in ee , derives from the fact that they are geographically the closest to western european countries - they all share long [ land or maritime ] borders with we countries and are `` half-surrounded '' by them . 
  fully cooperate with the eu for 12 years . 
  be collectively against one policy that is relatively unpopular in western europe as well . 
  western europeans claim we are just in the union to get money and `` when it 's time for us to give something , we guys are n't home . '', 
  the east being richer raised the importance of the whole region , it created a stable democratic buffer between western europe and russia , it made the eu economy stronger in total , it turned formerly poor nations into aid givers . 
  how can you underestimate that ? 
  peace at heart . 
   our country rises out of the sea by itself . 
  oh , we can relate , 
  luckily they are mostly social democratic , not socialist . 
  i referred to his lack of understanding on why eastern europe is considering less , which derives from the decades of destructive economics under the soviet regime . 
   when it 's time for you to give something , you guys are n't home . 
  you act like the eu for the past 12 years has been nothing more than giving money to eastern europe . 
  you act all pretentious when eastern europe has a strong opinion on some policy that is not particularly popular in western europe either . 
   you can definitively expect an east-west break-up of the eu oh now i get it . 
  you are actually living in 1989 . 
   post-homo-sovieticus people homo sovieticus is not any person living under the soviet rule . 
  it was and is used for people , who actually believed in this crap . 
  do n't come insulting an estonian as he or his nation actually wanted to be under the soviet regime !, 
   you definitely do not pull your load , or you would n't need so many grants . 
  is this your actual understanding of post-socialist economics ? 
  people , who love to get things handed to them have not been much complaining these past 12 years , until this very same `` absolutely nuts '' immigration/refugee policy . 
  if those refugees are part of the same wider group , which poses a threat , then it 's the right thing to do to ban them . 
  i personally do n't think rules should be so absolute and some should be allowed , but it 's the general mentality - single muslim men should not be allowed in for example . 
   that they were also part of the ussr really ? 
  so was tajikistan ... we call estonia nordic because of the relation with the nordic countries . 
  is china anywhere near south korean development level ? 
  you provided irrelevant proof . 
  you know , not all kind of proof is adequate . 
  claiming germany had a right to invade poland in 1939 can not be proven by events that happened in 1920 and 1930 . 
  it really is as simple as that . 
  i already say almost the same things about ** religious ** jews that i say about muslims . 
  for me , all religions are equally moronic , yet some religions , especially islam , is more violent and dominating than others , though orthodox jews are quite close in that matter . 
   and lithuania how so ? 
   wannabe nordic spirit our history is related to lithuania , but when we point out our relation with nordic countries , we are nordic wannabes ? 
  in estonian law , because ussr law is not applicable in estonia . 
  as estonia is the same state that it was in 1940 , all people , who came here without the permission of the government of the republic of estonia are considered illegal immigrants . 
  you can deport illegal immigrants . 
  your `` case law '' was ridiculous , because you deny collective consciousness and the right of self determination to ethnic groups . 
  women are n't some kind of special legal subjects by the way ... 
  so what if they were born after estonian independence ? 
  estonia , like most europe , has a jus sanguinis citizenship law , meaning one of your parents must be a citizen for you to get automatic citizenship . 
  their crime was them being there . 
  children of illegal immigrants are still illegal immigrants . 
  mixed background people have one parent , who was an estonian citizen , there is no question here . 
  you think i want to deport estonians , who are able to speak russian ?? 
  why am i even arguing with you ? 
  the people of tallinn are almost half illegal russians , that 's why . 
  i do n't dislike democracy . 
  but why do you include illegal immigrants into the electorate ? 
  especially in a small country that can be overrun by immigrant , especially if your 100 times bigger neighbor really wants it . 
  i 'll make it simple then : political support = / = economy growing thanks to foreign financial support, 
  look people , a guy claims i whined on nationalsocialism sub when i claimed the holocaust actually happened . 
  go back to your cave !, 
  yet people often use it in that context ... that 's why estonia as a baltic country should be scrapped . 
  in russia , the mafia is the government . 
  apparently war is an adequate alternative to how they are living now ... 
  how would you rate the quality of russian wikipedia ? 
  could it be considered neutral or does it share the general russian mass media views ? 
  yeah , let 's forgive them all their past and current crimes !, 
  of course they do , they 're just trying to intimidate their neighbors and save what they can . 
  never seen a bidet in estonia . 
  in fact , never seen one in finland either . 
  textbook 1938-1939 . 
  it is not just about something being there worth having , it 's just textbook russian imperialism . 
  never said that religious jews are a normal bunch of people ... 
  but in israel there are many secular or barely religious jews , who i have nothing against . 
  i see no people as `` chosen people '' . 
  that 's a dumb concept . 
  because you give `` proof '' that is not proof at all . 
  i wanted proof that the south korean and taiwanese economies grew thanks to us money , he gave proof of south korea and taiwan being supported by the us politically ...  you yourself never provide evidence for your claims such as the mythical six million . 
  what six million ? 
  china outgrew estonia ? 
  wow , what a shock . 
  do you even economy ? 
  effectively they will be the same , though their reasons for coming here may be different . 
  understandable , but that 's why it 's easier to understand why a nondemocratic country may prosper in economy and the two are not so strongly related .

  at least spanish and portuguese languages are closely related , you guys are actually like sister nations in many ways . 
  estonian is finnic and not even indo-european . 
  russian is more related to portuguese ( and punjabi for that matter ) than to estonian . 
  evangelical protestant it seems ... he was asked if he 's a baptist by the media but he has said no . 
  he has passed the `` alpha course '' of the baptist ... movement ? 
  sorry i do n't know the proper terminology for these things . 
  if you 've been to tallinn , [ the tallest church , st olaf 's church ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/st._olaf's_church,_tallinn ) is the place where the baptist congregation meets .

  translation :  pm j\u00fcri ratas said he is a religious person , but this question is a personal matter to each person . 
  going to the church or not going , it does n't make anybody worse or better . 
  `` religiousness expresses in first having a question do i believe in a god . 
  yes , i believe it . 
  i dare to say it that yes i do believe in god , '' said ratas in an video interview given to postimees . 
   `` in my case it does n't mean i go to church every sunday or that i read god 's word , but if there are moments i of course direct to god in my prayers . 
  this in whatever life occasion - be it politics , be them difficult decisions , be them family events , '' said ratas . 
   `` i 've got many acquaintances who are church people or go to church or are pastors in churches . 
  but it is not a topic for me that i say before or after eating [ this is an estonian expression ] . 
  i 've always said it is a very personal matter and who believes or does not believe - it is every person 's choice , '' he said . 
   according to ratas not everybody has to go to church , but those who do are not in any way different or worse people . 
  to me it sound like spoken from a defensive position , which is interesting , as i would not expect it needing defending in most places of the world ? 
  that 's the point of this post , people * do * give a shit . 
  there 's plenty of people who see this side of him as an oddity . 
  an oddity that 's usually not an oddity elsewhere in the world . 
  in usa it would be odd for obama to admit he * does n't * believe in a god - if he did , it would be front page news . 
  yea , i think the general attitude is that being gay is not a choice but believing in a god means you lack realistic critical thinking . 
  :d among the youth only of course as you said . 
  source is in estonian . 
  i 've posted it to / r/europe because it felt funny enough how in estonia one has to be brave to admit believing in a god . 
  i can imagine this is not the case in every european country , so maybe it is interesting to some , a small example of how things go on in a place where religion does n't play a big role and in fact people might look at you weird if you 're religious . 
  the wording sounds like what people say when they come out as gay . 
  hmmmm , seem so .

  in other words you 're letting us take the heat and `` can not into '' jokes for pushing it , but if it ends up working it 'll be easier for you guys to do the same . 
  fault ? 
  the conservative 49 % of the population probably think it 's a good thing and not a fault at all . 
  it is what it is . 
  live in western sphere of influence = develop similar opinions to the west ; live in russian sphere of influence = develop similar opinions to russians . 
  if you look at the map , russia is at 11 % . 
  finland is at 66 % , we 're in the middle , as is to be expected really . 
  just to add , reason why local russians are less supportive of same sex marriage is because many of them consume russia 's media and live in its sphere of information , therefore producing similar results to russia . 
   saxo grammaticus describes the estonians and curonians as participating in the ** battle of br\u00e5valla ** on the side of the swedes against the danes , who were aided by the livonians and the wends of pomerania . 
  other baltic tribes -- i.e. , the letts and lithuanians -- are not mentioned by saxo as participating in the fight . 
  [ 9 ] snorri sturluson relates in his ynglinga saga how the swedish king ingvar ( 7th century ) , the son of \u00d6sten and a great warrior , who was forced to patrol the shores of his kingdom fighting estonian vikings . 
  the saga speaks of his invasion of estonia where he fell in a battle against the men of estland who had come down with a great army . 
  after the battle , ** king ingvar ** was buried close to the seashore in estonia and the swedes returned home .

  not sure i could come up with a more generic looking church from estonia even if i tried ...  although i guess that spire is just a bit too fancy . 
  that show-off architect . 
  maybe he was a hot-blooded southerner . 
  :d there 's probably some with less decorated spires ... [ ah yes , here is is , the most generic church around these lands . 
  how about these , do you notice anything [ interesting in these old estonian-swedish names ?

  you mixed up the left and right there . 
  keskerakond is centrist left , reform is centrist right . 
  that 's why reform is whining about leftist turn , because social democrats are also left leaning . 
  reform party has gone as far as talk in international news ( j\u00fcrgen ligi on france24 recently ) how keskerakond has ties to russia and might be a threat . 
  personally i see it as them setting their own party needs above the needs of the country , by not saying it clearly that the security situation has not changed in estonia and tip-toeing around the issue when asked directly . 
  they allow estonia to be painted as having a russian-friendly government in international news , which is clearly not the full truth , it 's a much more complicated situation , but they allow it to happen because it plays into their agenda in local politics and it makes me sick . 
  they 've been labeling keskerakond as the boogeyman for all their existence . 
  estonian politics has largely been molded by the duality of reform and keskerakond playing their voter base against each-other , reform saying how savisaar brings putin to estonia and keskerakond saying ansip and reform are the root of all evil , this is a dangerous game because it divides our local russians further away from estonians and fuels hatred . 
  the truth is the new government is formed as a coalition between social democrats ( centre-left ) , keskerakond ( center-left , most popular party , has a large voted base in local russians and elderly ) and irl ( centre-right , semi-conservative & national ) . 
  every party got 5 seats in the government and it represents a more varied segment of the country 's population . 
  in many ways this government is way more balanced and finally gives some much-awaited voice to local russians and elderly . 
  reform is just acting like a spoiled little brat because they have n't not been in the government for 17 years . 
  it 's attitude like this that makes it a lot harder for those few estonian-russians to integrate better who actually want to .

  toompea is under attack ! '' . 
  estonian civilians immediately arrive to the scene and block the russians in the courtyard . 
  estonians start singing banned national songs in unison . 
  they wave the banned flags of blue black and white . 
  the crowd parts into two , forming a corridor from which the russians leave , ashamed with their heads bowed down and dragging their red flags behind them . 
  nobody was injured . 
  there were no other protests following that . 
  years later . 
  governement is relocating a soviet war memorial from the city center to the military graveyard . 
  russians protest this . 
  the protests turn violent . 
  despite the protesting and looting which lasted days and was the worst that has been seen here since wwii , the statue was relocated . 
  russians , angry that the statue was relocated , try to claim human rights violation multiple times from european courts . 
  the police or the governement are found not guilty of any of the charges . 
  some time later , estonian embassy is attacked in moscow . 
  estonians do n't retaliate . 
  the statue still stays in the military graveyard and there have been no protests since . 
  liberty and independence are best achieved and kept with peaceful means . 
  national heroes should not be soldiers , but people of culture and science .

  when we write foreign words in their original orthography or in a foreign transcribtion , we write them in cursive and pronounce them as close as possible to the original language . 
  we call these quote-words . 
  words like * reality-show * and * cum laude * . 
  yeah , i think it used to be * \u0161ahmatt * or something , but they changed it to * male * in the 30s , during the language preservation programme . 
  it 's derived from * malev * , meaning `` battleforce '' or `` battlegroup '' . 
  i 've seen so many people writing * finish * instead of * fini\u0161 * and * rezhiss\u00f6\u00f6r * instead of * re\u017eiss\u00f6\u00f6r * . 
  this is not allowed by the estonian language institute and regarded an orthographic flaw , but a lot of people use it . 
  it 's a part of the `` anglo-mania '' going on - but language and orthography change in time and we have to adapt to the influences from english . 
  and these two weird letters : \u0161 , \u017e . 
  these do n't exist in estonian , but are used to write down foreign words ( usually loanwords ) phonetically . 
  for example : genre = \u017eanr , finish = fini\u0161 .

  the percentage of college students varies greatly between the genders , women are the majority . 
  the percentage of high school graduates are much higher among women as well . 
  men die much earlier than women and suffer more violent deaths , illnesses and alcoholism is more prevalent among men . 
  men are forced to do mandatory military service 8-11 months and then periodical re-training until they 're too old to serve , while women are not forced to do anything for the country . 
  all the while some women are protesting the wage gap between genders , which has been proven to be false .

  the vast majority of our borrowed word roots come from middle or high german ( well over 90 % by some estimates ) . 
  these are not very well visible to the ordinary person , but they are there ( words like kelder , r\u00fc\u00fctel , laskma , tuba , kaunis , tuvi etc ) . 
  borrowed roots make up around 45 % to 55 % of our word roots , so that means a lot of our words are german by origin . 
  there is a lot of mistrust and fear against russia . 
  we are scared and trepid too often . 
  the minstry of justice website states that there 's an average of 100 murders per year in estonia . 
  they also add that the vast majority of these are commited between people who know each other and almost exclusively under the influence of alcohol . 
  watching crime reports on tv , it 's almost always about how ivan and vladimir are sitting in a russian ghetto and drinking . 
  ivan takes the last sip of vodka and vladimir kills ivan in a fit of rage over the last sip . 
  this is my subjective experience . 
  the prisons are mostly populated with russian nationals as well . 
  i do n't want to encourage hate or anything , but this is sadly how it is here due to a variety of social-economic reasons . 
  it * is * embarrassing for some :(, 
  something about some muslim thing/black thing/some other ethnicity or race is depicted in the western world - instant racism . 
  western world depicts only white people 's things - instant racism . 
  conclusion : white people are naturally racists , therefore it is racist to discriminate against their racism . 
  and they saw that it was good . 
  and on the seventh day they rested . 
  i do n't understand the mentality with these guys . 
  why are they doing this ? 
  not all vegetarians are the same . 
  some value animals as much as humans , some slightly less and some are just hipster hypocrites ( which you think is the majority ) . 
  while those kind of people might not value animals quite as much as humans , they still value them more than the rest of humanity . 
  imagine humans in all three scenarios you provided . 
  for people who value animals as much as humans , this is why they do n't eat meat . 
  there 's nothing wrong with hunting in my opinion . 
  except when it 's done for fun and the meat and furs are n't used . 
  hunter-gatherers rely heavily on hunting and that is totally okay . 
  i think that 's in northern latvia . 
  at first i thought it was in estonia as well and i thought they were the setus , but their flag is completely different . 
  the mayor of tallinn is a well known corrupt politician who takes hand-outs from the russian governement . 
  he constantly does publicity things like this . 
  he wastes money on things like this , when at the same time , the kindergartens in tallinn are in grave disrepair . 
  he always tries to win the votes of russians and old folks . 
  old folks usually use public transport . 
  that 's why this is happening , not because he 's a great mayor or something . 
  he has been so shamed by the media for his corrupt ways that he has almost ceased to appear in interviews . 
  oh , but he has his own television channel ( tallinn 's television ) , which is kept up on tax payer 's money . 
  it 's a propaganda channel full of bullshit . 
  he has no problems appearing on there often . 
  the reason why he 's still relevant in politics is because the russians and old people vote for him , because they are basically the only ones who still believe in his demagogy . 
  a discussion about passing a law that legally requires politicians to have an ethic code . 
  weather . 
  christmasy stuff : taking care of homeless people , charities , etc.

  so if you loose or gain some territory , are you not the same state anymore ? 
  if you reform your constitution , why are you suddenly a new state ? 
   really . 
  some people subscribe to astonishingly weird bullshit . 
  yeah , it 's you . . 
  that 's extremely not pov at all . 
   talin tallinn  can compete in size beauty and magnitude of say of old pre ww1/ww2 berlin , paris , london , or vienna ? 
  i mean , you choose to compare a small provincial capital with large imperial capitals ... frankfurt is also a large city compared to tallinn . 
  if you compare the old town of tallinn with western european cities of the same size , tallinn rather sticks out , it truly is one of the most spectacular old towns in europe . 
  * or colloquially also * aia !, 
  why do you declare a new republic every time you change the constitution ? 
  we 've had 4 constitutions and three foreign occupations for five decades and we are still living in the 1st republic . 
  wow, 
  i see both kinds of people here . 
  but computers are mostly for personal gaming , consoles are if you want to invite your friends over !, 
  you are free to add ... 
   does russia really want to invade though ? 
  it 's not like we know that . 
  we do know that russia is a hostile imperialist dictatorship that has indeed invaded several neighbors in the last decade and is constantly breaching borders and massing armament at the borders . 
   most of your comments are about how you dislike americans so you can understand my confusion . 
  which of my comments are about my dislike of americans again ? 
  never seen it , but if you read the [ wikipedia article ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/black_friday_\\ ( shopping \\ ) #other _ countries ) , then there is a list of countries included , where they also have these sales . 
   no , what is it ? 
  `` tactical enemy red ''  as someone who hates the us do n't you feel morally conflicted ? 
  no , because i do n't hate the us . 
  estonian * rootsi * ( `` sweden '' ) and english `` russia '' do derive from the [ same root ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/roslagen ) , 
  yes , because you know what the other option is ... 
   tend to have smaller less beautiful old cities than the rest of europe but that 's just not true ...  we have the most ugly concrete slabs in our cities believe it or not , but so do most western european cities and although they may be nicer than ours , they still are far from what a tourist would want to see . 
  reside in them , sure , but much else touristworthy survives in many countries . 
  exactly , so i quite frankly do n't get your point . 
  it 's not like we only have the ugly apartment block districts ... 
  in estonia it has to be one of the lesser-known towns in the country 's northeast like [ p\u00fcssi ] ( https://www.google.ee/search?client=opera&amp;hs=tf9&amp;biw=1517&amp;bih=731&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=1&amp;q=p\u00fcssi+&amp;oq=p\u00fcssi+&amp;gs_l=img.3..0j0i24k1l9.2680.2680.0.2838.1.1.0.0.0.0.82.82.1.1.0....0...1c.1.64.img..0.1.81.9jpmr39ifdk ) or [ kivi\u00f5li ] ( https://www.google.ee/search?client=opera&amp;hs=llu&amp;biw=1517&amp;bih=731&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=1&amp;q=kivi\u00f5li&amp;oq=kivi\u00f5&amp;gs_l=img.3.0.0l4j0i30k1l2j0i24k1l4.70944.72137.0.73715.5.5.0.0.0.0.175.426.4j1.5.0....0...1c.1.64.img..0.5.425.j5dgvvloobg ) ( which has cool ash-mounds though ) . 
  there could be , most likely some really run-down post-socialist country like moldova or belarus . 
  quite objectively , they are the least tourist-friendly and there are barely any sights made worth for visiting . 
  flat is life !, 
  it has got to be molvania !, 
  slovakia and andorra have been my favourites . 
  a what ? 
  or you 're stoned ? 
  as i understood , this is n't a north v. south thing , rather a dense v. sparse population thing . 
  i doubt our conservative people 's party ( ekre ) would rise over 20 % . 
  even now their support is around 15 % and it 's unnaturally high . 
  russian has that strong vibe just like german . 
  i mean both languages can be really cool and perhaps the best in other contexts , but `` pleasant '' ? 
  that 's not a quality i would characterize these languages with . 
  i just do n't get you people ... 
  he meant pleasant , not otherwise impressive !, 
   something like what many middle eastern monarchies have , where there is a balance between democratic and institutional/hereditary voices loooooooooooooooooooool, 
  of course , but this strongly depends on the neighborhood . 
  yeah , estonians usually do n't care for marriage anyway . 
  you can get married if you want to , but you can also live together until death and raise a family without ever marrying - ai n't nobody going to care ... 
  26 and no . 
  should i be in a relationship for like 5 years or so , i 'm not eventually against it , just do n't see the hype about it . 
  it is if you count in weekends . 
  plus not all family members have their vacations on the same time . 
  so it is . 
  lots of people got their property back that was illegally taken from them during the soviet occupation . 
  and population density seems to be they key word in lots of people having summer cottages . 
  because it 's in a far worse neighborhood . 
  it happens , but rather rarely . 
  pepsi is never in 1 l pepsi is rare here , but 1.5 l costs about $ 1.10 + $ 0.10 for the recyclable bottle . 
  i agree . 
  at least 3/4 of latvia without latgale . 
  the difference is that their own identity does n't really consider them nordic . 
  why do some people answer , but not include where they are from ? 
  a flair would do too ... 
  i found somewhere that by 1988 24 % of finnish families had a second home and by 1994 it was 19 % in estonia ( 28 % with cottages shared by several families ) . 
  considering it was the early post-soviet era , i figure the rates are more or less the same by now . 
  i would n't say these are * that * similar :d, 
  that sort of goes against eu principles ... 
  which city if you do n't mind sharing ? 
  and these are one of the nicer soviet-era apartment blocks . 
  so overall there seems to be a very stark dense-sparse europe divide here , which incidentally means that western europe in the narrow sense ( benelux , france , uk ) do n't usually have cottages and all the others do . 
  i wish other eu members took a similar approach against danish citizens buying property . 
  there are plenty of dacha-type cottages in estonia too , mostly around the russian speaking neighborhoods . 
  a house , cottage , cabin - all of them fit the criteria if they are mainly used as family getaways . 
  the apartment block districts only though . 
  plus you can find similar buildings outside the former eastern bloc as well . 
   as foreigners as a rule can not buy cottages in denmark wait , why is that ? 
  the divide itself is n't so big politically as there are far more important ethnic and economic divisions in estonia . 
  that said , the rural people tend to be among the poorest in the country . 
  still they vote for either the liberals , conservatives , social democrats or leftists , depending on the region . 
  historically we 've also had agricultural parties that have been popular in some rural areas . 
  by values they are definitely less tolerating and more conservative , though probably not particularly more religious as very few are in estonia . 
  most of the more intelligent youth of the country flocks to the towns , some of the less fortunate kids try to work abroad and not really the brightest kids stay behind . 
  our rural life is strongly deteriorating and its distinct lifestyle is vanishing quickly . 
  [ here ] ( https://statistikaamet.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/rahvastikumuutus_1989_2011_tsoonid.png ) is a map of the urbanization and rural population decline in estonia . 
  green areas have a growing population , red areas a declining population , the darker the colour , the quicker the change is . 
  ( the red areas within green regions are the tows themselves , which are n't growing themselves due to suburbanization . ), 
  oh it definitely is one of the nicer ones in one of the nicer apartment block neighborhoods . 
  i grew up in [ this ] ( https://www.google.ee/maps/@59.4430361,24.8853349,3a,75y,64.4h,103.03t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1s5xda4sulr8-vtdek0k29pa!2e0!7i13312!8i6656!6m1!1e1 ) building in one of the worst neighborhoods of my city in the post-soviet 1990s , so i know what you 're talking about :d, 
  i personally have both summer cottages of my grandparents , which will most likely stay in the family . 
  both are about 40 minutes drive from the city limits , one is only for summer use , but the other has my grandparents living there for the last few years . 
  the conditions are quite good in both , with electricity and running water , though one has an `` outhouse '' reachable from inside the house for `` that kind of stuff '' .

  the period of nato led mission in afghanistan was actually the safest period of time the country had seen in decades .

  it 's difficult to imagine how africa would have turned out had it not been affected by colonialism . 
  i reckon most of it would be like the ingenious peoples of papua new guinea , where people today live pretty much the same way they did a 100 , 200 or a 1000 years ago . 
  funnily enough the bulk of migrants come from countries the west did n't bomb - eritrea , syria , nigeria , senegal , gambia etc. 
  i think it 's more of a case of us vs. them than extremist ideology . 
  the muslim communities in britain ( or anywhere else for that matter ) identify with their fellow muslims back in the middle east , rather than the british , regardless of current ideology . 
  they do n't necessarily condone extremist islamic ideology because they approve of it but because siding with the official british government position would be seen as a betrayal of their fellow muslims back home .

  mainstream news sites will always attract a much wider and overall lower quality audience compared to specific educational and discussion sites .

  on one hand , it 's pretty much the epitome of free speech , it 's quite informative journalism , you can comment on anything and they publish readers ' articles , on the other hand , anonymous commenting policy means there will be a lot of stupid and offensive posts ( they 're somewhat moderated but obviously the mods ca n't keep up with everything all the time ) .

  wonder why , and it was not because the nazis were cool guys ... 
  they were better than the soviets , that 's why . 
   why fucking believe what you are saying ? 
  because it 's the position of the international community . 
   crimea is russia , majority of population is russian , speaks russian , feels russian and almost everything in city resembles russian culture . 
  majority population = / = ownership !, 
   it takes much more than a few decades to erase every sign of local culture and repopulate it with people who would feel , speak and support russia , russians never managed to do it in baltics . 
  neither did they in crimea . 
  the crimean tatars strongly opposed the russian invasion . 
   yes it would be ` rightful russian clay ' , why the fuck not ? 
  this is a sick world view . 
   and now it was taken from them . 
  giving a gift is legal , taking it is illegal . 
  why do i have to explain this to you ? 
   well why did n't estonia get what it deserved ? 
  to be dismantled for helping nazis in ww2 . 
  dude , you just do n't know history . 
  the soviets invaded us first and committed atrocities here . 
  then nazis came , obviously did n't care about estonia 's independence , but some estonians wanted to fight against the bigger evil - the soviets and joined nazi ranks . 
  eventually estonians were told either to join the estonian ss-division or be shot . 
  of course they joined . 
  after the war the us congress declared that the estonian and latvian ss-divisions were not movements hostile to the us because they were `` separate and distinct in purpose , ideology , activities , and qualifications for membership from the german ss '' . 
  they were even chosen as guards at the nuremberg trials . 
  now tell me more about estonians `` deserving it '' ... 
  you do n't know much . 
   unilaterally declaring independence breaches the international law on territorial integrity  this is illogical . 
  if your interpretation would apply , then we could erase the right to self determination from legal textbooks ... 
  the yalta agreement had no legal effect on us ... 
   how long was poland nazi for 5 minutes ?

   how long was estonia a soviet baltic state ?

  why are you arguing when you lack basic knowledge ? 
   technically illegal occupation according to international law that occurred between 1945 and 1990 . 
  how does that sound familiar ... how was that an illegal occupation ? 
  that 's not how international law works . 
   not from a reich perspective  indeed irrelevant as international law is above domestic law in this issue . 
  for example the allied occupation of germany was legal . 
  and it 's not about perspective - the international community and academic literature define it usually . 
  an imperialist dictatorship is a helluva menace . 
  they did n't cease to exist legally .

  i think we want to be ourselves culturally , just like any dane , swede or finn . 
  we might rather claim that we have strong scandinavian influences in our culture . 
   why you skandi people have no humor ... 
  i 'm not sure who you meant by that . 
  also , could it also be that jokes work differently with people of different backgrounds ? 
  and even if it was a joke and i chuckled , why not point out how ridiculous the claim was ? 
  did i ? 
  in our consciousness i think that 's exactly how it is - some names are `` russian names '' and some are `` swedish names '' and some are `` estonian names '' and some are just generally `` foreign names '' . 
  who says i get offended when i point out hypocrisies , inconsistencies or flat out mistakes ? 
  so let me get this straight . 
  the original map portrayed us as russians , although we are not russians , not even indo-europeans . 
  yet when i made an analogy that was supposed to be just as stupid and compare you with another unrelated group , you think it 's `` hard to find any resemblance '' ??? 
  dude , that 's the point !, 
  the analogy is supposed to be just as stupid !, 
  and why do you think that ? 
  because i made an analogy that is supposed to be just as stupid as the original comparison ? 
  it is a macro ethnic group though . 
  the term `` indo-europeans '' does exist , you know . . 
  rather arbitrary way of defining geographical regions , do n't you think ? 
  :d did you consider ireland eastern european when it was still poor ? 
  and what is the arbitrary degree of wealth we should have for us to be northern european in your book ? 
  i mean , the economies of post-socialist countries have grown a lot in recent decades and many are ahead of some of the southern european countries , 
  it 's weird , i may not be triggered , i just like arguing and this is a good topic . 
  i rather really ask questions and wait for why the person would think so . 
  the reason is very often a general lack of knowledge about these parts of europe and a mild cold war era bias . 
  yeah , i get that , but there are people ready to defend that position , even though they really have never been to these parts of europe . 
  perhaps because it happens more often . 
  really ? 
  why do you think so ? 
  except the portuguese and spaniards are actually alike , unlike estonians and russians ... 
  i may be aware , i was just offering an analogy that would sum up how off that initial comparison was . 
  well then you look moroccan ... 
  nordic countries = / = northern europe , baby . 
   the nordics do n't acknowledge you as such yet if you look at the facts then estonia is pretty much a nordic country . 
  there are very few reasons to consider finland a nordic country and estonia not . 
   nor do the europeans . 
  the same europeans , who ca n't point to estonia on a map , ca n't distinguish between east and north and who ca n't distinguish between the terms northern europe and nordic countries ? 
  yeah , big deal ... 
   must be the russian dna ( now i 'm in real trouble ) rather random , although a good way to unnecessarily insult an estonian . 
   how am i biased ? 
  because you put the word `` occupation '' into brackets , making it look like you are questioning that there was an occupation .

  not this : http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=mottie but this : http://www.winterwar.com/tactics/mottis.htm#birth, 
  actually this is pretty much what presidents of several eu member states have communicated to their citizens - that they are shit if they are against globalization ( mass immigration ) . 
  what do you think the nato hedgehog event in estonia was ? 
  a giant clusterfook . 
  that is what forest brothers did while being idle and bored . 
  that 's nothing . 
  sometimes they steal railroads with train echelons on it . 
  economy is the first order partial derivative of wealth . 
  economic growth is the second order partial derivative . 
  change of economic growth is the third order partial derivative . 
  if you do n't take into account all first order partial derivatives , then trying to account second or third order derivatives does not make much sense . 
  brussels and national establishments have embarrassed themselves already enough , thus further power grab will not be tolerated . 
  eu can only survive as a loose confederation + strong nato . 
  nato will secure the outer borders . 
  international conventions on refugees will likely be changed to limit mass migrations . 
  the after-effect of switching from uralic to indo-european . 
  baltoscandia is a thing . 
  by 1919 , finland was already independent and the czar family had all been killed already and the russian empire had ceased to exist . 
  and germany had surrendered . 
  they ( and we ) keep up their minimal mental shields all the time . 
  the ugrians of finno-ugrians in western siberia had ( and still have ) a population density of about 50-100 km2 per one individual - about the same as the density of big predators ( wolves , bears , lynx ) in estonia . 
  wolverines need even more space than that - about 10-20x more . 
  that 's what i wrote about . 
  in soviet russia , you belong to estonia . 
  the bolshevik rule was not a legal successor of the russian empire . 
  the only regions that have retained legal regional continuity with the russian empire are finland and estonia . 
  incidentally , estonia was the first to recognize soviet russia . 
  thus , estonia had rights over soviet russia , not the other way around . 
  based on the downvoting it seems that i have struck a nerve ( or two ) . 
  economic growth is the wrong way to solve the conondrum . 
  the solution is to implement sustainable economic models . 
  none of the growing economic models are sustainable . 
  sustainable economic models imply an equilibrium population size . 
  third world needs to implement one-child policy - all of them . 
  poles are allergic to ereliukas . 
  the real problem with the phrase is that mass immigration and carbon neutral life in europe are incompatible with each other , even without considering religious conflicts . 
  burning wood in stoves against the eu passivhaus directive should be enough . 
  do n't underestimate your opponents . 
  the polls show that the vast majority of real women are against mass immigration . 
  the feminist movement has either been infiltrated and overrun or an astroturf from the very start . 
  a false flag operation . 
  or an inside infiltration and takeover . 
  the feminists are not led by ` women ' , but by the other side of the komintern . 
  yes , there is no need to equal them . 
  but 60 000 us troops in the baltics would be sweet . 
  it would mean that russia would have to keep 200 000 at that border , meaning that very few would be spared to the ukraine campaign . 
  the 3 were full penetrations , the rest of the 100 + were just a casual cop feel . 
  actually you are mistaken . 
  the poll dynamics shows that men have been constantly more pro-immigration than women ( disregard the ` just right amount ' crowd ; look at the ` could welcome more ' crowd ) . 
  i smell a big profit somewhere . 
   0 points ( 45 % upvoted ) so , what , 5 up from the 1 default and then also 6 downvotes ? 
  that 5-year plan of 1 million a year is exactly what the un migration office has been touting since last spring . 
  1/1000 if you consider official stats . 
  1/2000 if you take into account false self-identifications and recent arrivals . 
  generalised over eu , multiply those 2 by 2 000-10 000 and you have got 4000 up to 20 000 santa 's little helpers . 
  the last one . 
  and the bigotry of assuming that they ( the establishment ) are the righteous . 
  you do have a point , in that the moscow patriarch of the orthodox church is part of the fsb , which is under the command of putin . 
  has been so since the times of stalin . 
  the best of the rest ;-), 
  so if finland is considered the best , what does it say about all the others ? 
  30 year old refugee men have an average oecd education level of a 2nd grade . 
  15 year old finnish girls have an average oecd education level of a 10th grade . 
  checks out . 
  flash mobs need to be countered with flash standoffs by the locals . 
  like was done in tallinn , may 15 , 1990 . 
  youtube watch?v = wwq1tjev5r8 offending refugees need to be scared shitless . 
  or , the police should raise ( edit . 
  rise ) to the challenge . 
   because we 're afraid that it plays into the hands of the swedish democrats ( populist right-wing ) . 
  is n't that xenophobia ? 
  international socialists , also known as internazis . 
  behold the other side of the komintern . 
   it 's a sensitive topic , sometimes we do n't dare to say things as they are because we 're afraid that it plays into the hands of the swedish democrats ( populist right-wing ) . 
  we have to take responsibility within the police-force . 
  let 's hope that they will really really take responsibility . 
  and resign . 
  in estonia any immigration critical statement is tied to the ekre party . 
  a pattern emerges ... 
  ex or no ex , what matters is connection to active politicians . 
  you mean no other media owners / editors have direct connection to active politicians ? 
  the difference from a cultural centre and a separate mosque building is the constant screams over the neighbouring area from the minarette . 
  other than that there is not much difference . 
  both have produced jihadi soldiers . 
   otherwise , i do n't know how many thousand churches we could count here . 
  you would be surprised how many churches in estonia are being counted without a church tower . 
   you 'll get an insurance on stuff that are likely to need it . 
  that 's why you insure your car or your house , but not your left arm , for example . 
  how likely is islamization in estonia ? 
  it has produced at least one jihadi soldier already , so estonia is well on its way . 
  especially when computing the per muslim capita . 
  pianists and violin players and athletes and such often insure their hands . 
  an economic ponzi scheme needs to have growing amount of people to give loans to . 
  the natives refuse to take additional excessive loans . 
  if you refuse to militarily help your allies against the invasion of russia , then that counts as being pro-russia . 
  you are shifting goalposts . 
  the point was the opinions of germans at a relative scale .

  posssible this summer already ? 
  why ? 
  ca n't europe just kick the can down the road again ? 
  `` their leader , christian lindner ( fdp ) , said last week that the best way forward is for greece to leave the eurozone , and for greek debt to be forgiven afterwards . '', 
  the fdp in germany is a bit eurosceptic ? 
  interesting , did n't know that . 
  opposing nato in a time when the us is strengthening the baltics against someone in the east does n't seem reasonable ... even though de gaulle did withdraw the military from nato command during the cold war . 
  and i have n't heard if any other candidate from the major parties supported this , that 's why it 's kind of marginal . 
  unless macron , fillon , hamon support it . 
  not very sure about the last one especially . 
  melenchon feels like a very marginal politician to me at least , someone who could never win the elections unless due to some really extreme circumstances . 
  like le pen , both oppose nato membership , or so i 've read . 
  so italy , greece could have just turned around the refugees at the border then , if their authorities wanted to do so ? 
  with no legal or other consequences ? 
  i stated an example and i want to see proof from you then , not abstract words . 
  the compulsory quota system which proposed actual fines for countries that refused to act and still obliged them to act in some time was what then ? 
  illegal to begin with ? 
  unless the eu grows a spine for dealing with the refugee crisis , for instance , we 're going to see more brexit-like events in the future . 
  that means taking tough decisions like turning away refugees , deporting those that are found to be illegible for asylum status , etc. 
  not to mention shit like sopa acts , etc. 
  + i see the news on the riots in france , whether the riots are actually that damaging and big or not . 
  the more they have these news the more it is likely le pen will get points for it . 
  imo this is a bit tricky , since lots of people tend not to think about the big picture at all , but rather think about their well-being first , it 's not a new phenomenon or anything , but the question might be whether there were and are people who lost because of the euro transition , whether they deserved it , were they compensated , should they be compensated , etc. 
  `` has the euro really caused more economic growth , more jobs and more economic stability ? 
  i do n't think it has . '', 
  i think it has , i could speak for one-two companies in estonia , but it would not be a very detailed analysis and would be more based on investor and company owner 's increased trust and lack of currency exchange fees . 
  we have calculations though , if economists are any good , after all , we are talking about the past , not the future , like it was with the eu referendum in the uk , for example . 
  i can imagine greece not joining the euro , because not every eu has joined it , unless there was some huge negative side of the pre-euro greece that was successfully cured by the euro and could not be realistically amended by something else . 
  but i see this as a very complicated debate , unless someone has studied this extensively ... 
  how do you define failure ? 
  and also , how trucidator defines failure , that would be an interesting question . 
  we could define it in the number of jobs lost , economic growth lost , economic crisis length shortened/prolonged and what consequences it all brings . 
  i feel this is huge debate , but different people in greece or other parts that may believe , truthfully or not , that the euro damaged their wellbeing will think differently . 
  is there any indication or argument that podemos would have lost much more votes if they had n't joined with iu ? 
  i doubt that 's true . 
  i was n't saying that they lost vote solely because they joined together , but it 's not obvious to me that they gained the 5 % or whatever iu had before . 
  in spain unidos podemos actually lost a bit of the popular vote overall , gaining no new seats . 
  i do n't believe in this , with hamon and melenchon , it did n't work in spain with podemos and the radical left , even though hamon is from the socialists . 
  in spain they did n't get additional votes in the general election by combining their forces . 
  right now i ca n't see how the polls are n't predicting a macron/fillon victory , whoever comes second in the first round . 
  it was pretty clear that brexit and trump were n't impossible based on the numbers , which were very close , but here - i just do n't see it . 
  unless we get another refugee crisis or some kind of migrant uprising that is so bad , and macron/fillon totally fail to react , or something . 
  i personally do n't think idealism is bad , as long as the idealist is more invested in pragmatic solutions than empty slogans . 
  maybe , but then they are those , who do n't care about politics much , and might go as mercenaries . 
  they are probably not counted here . 
  provided they do n't change their minds , of course . 
  whether in favor or against this . 
  no , no they do n't , they can be , but they do n't have to be . 
  maybe in swiss referendums they can be more frequently precise , but in big referendums like joining/leaving the eu they just ca n't be , because the wording and implications list would be enormous . 
  we have debates for that . 
  * polish death camps, 
  not how the world actually works , espeically politics . 
  that was a serious question , not a caricature . 
  real example , where someone refuses to do so : in switzerland , muslim schoolchildren who refuse to shake their teacher 's hand may be fined $ 5,000 https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2016/05/25/in-switzerland-muslim-schoolchildren-who-refuse-to-shake-their-teachers-hand-may-be-fined-5000/?utm_term=.31142ce9fd9a as per your caricature : 1 ) the softest , first response to this must be condemnation , debate , exchange of argument , if that does n't work ... 2 ) then exclusion from the social group until the subject learn the societal norms of this particular social group , , if that does n't work ... 3 ) more harsh measures , like said fine , because it 's basically against the law , which states that people ca n't be treated differently based on sex . 
  but it 's usually simpler in real life , since those who refuse to shake hands never have a good explanation for it , other than `` my faith '' , and people are worried about this only because it 's highly likely , that someone who holds such views will hold much more dangerous ones as well . 
  because of `` his faith '' , or in particular , how it is often interpreted in his societal group . 
  that 's just one example , sure . 
  but what do you propose then ? 
  you write `` with little interaction with the rest of france , then nothing will change '' , so what exactly do oyu propose the french do according to the `` integraiton goes both ways '' ? 
  let 's take women 's rights . 
  do the french stop shaking hands with women too ? 
  integration can go both ways , but only if the french want it . 
  if you 're a devout muslim , or someone who holds denigrating views towards women because of your faith , you come in some group and you do n't behave like the group - then , yeah , you will be disliked . 
  something like that . 
  without actually contacting with the french muslims i ca n't tell how exactly do they behave . 
  would that be an even more refugee-friendly coalition ? 
  while this may smell of corruption , i remember in estonia we had a small uproar when they raised taxes which harmed the hotel business . 
  good . 
  i keep asking myself , are people just going to flood the streets every time they do this ? 
  people are writing here that this is n't the first time they have attempted to pass a similar law . 
  yet anti-immigration parties are called far-right or extreme right ? 
  partido popular seems pretty right-wing to me with their restrictions to abortion , not even close to sanders ? 
  skeptic here , ca n't they just approve the law in 3 , 6 months or something ? 
  they should have resigned , all of them . 
  until it 's done it 's just talk talk talk . 
  hussein does n't , but saddam , if you take out one `` d '' means port . 
  totally irrelevant to your question , but still  had a surprised american friend ask me what does the `` sadam '' ( with no translation ) sign near the port mean . 
  i really do n't think it is , especially it 's pronounced in an american way - `` yeah '', 
  macron rallying voters from the right ? 
  the `` freedom to wear '' that you and some here are supporting is an `` extremist '' one , a pure laissez-faire approach , but to freedom of wear . 
  i 'd wager it\u00e4s never been practised anywhere at all , because sometimes a ban saves lives and people 's health . 
  waiting for the communities to sort it out themselves or through some `` community outreach '' is very naive , out of touch with reality , where said communities usually have authoritarian figures as heads who do n't give a shit what the rest of the world thinks and whose motto is `` if you do n't like it , come and change it by force '' . 
  and who will scream `` repression ! '', 
  when someone actually does come to help those women . 
  the only alternative then , is when women or men rebel in those communities themselves , but guess what 's going to be the first thing they will say if they succeed - `` why did you suspect this was happening for a long time and did n't do anything about it ? '' . 
  if they ever succeed . 
  i have addressed in another comment by saying that i believe this to be a band-aid solution , but until all serious talks of `` forcibly integrating '' the whatever small communities or simply individuals are a taboo - this banning business is going to be a thing . 
  maybe it 's more about sending a message . 
  on the other hand that will not work on the truly conservative/radical religious types of people . 
  i 'm fine if the woman wants that voluntarily , to wear the veil , as long as it is only about her and no one else . 
  but that 's not how it works sometimes . 
  i disagree , said conservative types understand either force or very dedicated effort against them , they might even see freedom of choice as a means , not something to be actually practised , the main problem remains is how to effectively determine who is wearing the face veil voluntarily . 
  i 'm not sure you can make the bully change his ways by doing nothing . 
  yes , those who might get beaten at home for not wearing this will surely tell me that openly . 
  if they could speak freely about it then it would probably be easier to solve this problem in a different way , but they ca n't without endangering themselves . 
  no i do n't feel the irony , those who wear not out of choice but because they will get beaten at home or in their community somehow concern me much more than those who wear it by choice . 
  even though i acknowledge that this is a band-aid type of a solution , but no solution seems worse to me , and as long as all talk about `` forcibly integrating '' those communities who spit on women 's and other people 's right is taboo this whole face veil banning is going to be a thing . 
  `` what people want to wear '' i kind of doubt that is the case for many of the people who wear the veil . 
  no , protesting , forming groups with goals and putting pressure does . 
  to be fair , the tories had allies in the likes of `` liberal unionists '' and other parties , who ultimately joined the tories or just dispersed .

  i doubt they 'll be confirming this , iran and russia are working together in syria . 
  lack of grammatical gender is great ... then you find out we _ still _ have 69 noun declensions . 
   well , we make up for the small number of cases with five grammatical genders . 
  :p grammatical genders are devil 's work . 
   the case system nearly broke me when learning german . 
  then i arrive to poland to find they 've added three extra . 
  that 's what ... seven total ? 
  you ai n't seen nothing yet , 
  reflexive denial , it 's common . 
   a _ nordic _ neighbour fixed that for ya . 
   i blame russia when russia is to blame i think it 's fair , do n't you ? 
   you 're not even trying to engage in earnest dicussion which part of  where do you get such a warped view on this issue ? 
  i bet your also the type of person that blames russia for all of your little problems . 
  ... was an invitation for discussion ? 
  what us invasion ? 
  a no-fly zone would 've been a good start , and proper libyan-style air support would have gone a long way . 
  nah , i quite like latvia . 
   i would n't call supplying the rebels with thousands of missiles , training and gear `` inaction '' . 
  the fact that we created equally strong sides allowed this war to stagnate and last this long to begin with . 
  yes , that 's what i 've been saying . 
  we did n't do _ enough _ . 
   you 're literally trying to justify the pointless deaths of thousands of people , by saying that was n't even a whole lot . 
  no , i 'm saying that _ our inaction _ led to a massive increase in the number of deaths . 
   where do you draw the limit of `` okay , that thousand of people is not okay anymore '' ? 
  i draw the line at when an autocrat sends his army against unarmed civilians . 
  especially when those civilians have goals i agree with , but that 's just me being subjective . 
   lol people do n't learn ? 
  well , what have we learned from leaving assad in power for those past 4 years ? 
  ~ 330k + dead , 5 _ million _ refugees . 
  compare to libya : 15-25k dead during the war , 5-15k in post-war strife , 80-200k refugees . 
  fyi , pre-conflict populations were ~ 6m for libya , ~ 18m for syria . 
  should 've let gaddafi in power , ofc , things would be _ so much better _ in libya now . 
  which countries do n't differentiate between refugees and immigrants ? 
  no , but i _ do _ blame russia for problems russia is a cause of , and i assign them the appropriate share of blame for problems they contribute to . 
  edgy , i know . 
  fsa only came about _ after _ assad sent tanks against pro-democracy demonstrators , at their core were those in the military who resisted the orders who joined up with the former demonstrators . 
  right now it 's a three-way fight between assad , isis and syrian opposition ( including the kurds ) . 
  russia 's goal in bombing non-is groups is to make it into a _ two-way _ fight , forcing the west to support the least worse option , i.e. 
  assad . 
  we should 've taken out assad directly , back when we had the chance . 
  the country would be in disarray , but not the hellhole it is right now . 
  i mean , people speak about how bad the situation in libya is , but since the war started in syria , both the losses and refugee numbers there have exceeded those in libya by orders of magnitude . 
  but of course , russia protected assad from international action even back then . 
  edit : sorry , i missed that part at first :  why would assad fuck over his regime on purpose ? 
  assad saw what happens when you let arab spring get out of hand in egypt . 
  he then saw what happens when you counter it with violence w/o backing in un security council in libya . 
  he 's been _ protecting _ his regime , not fucking it over . 
   quickly after that withdraw the big guns from ukraine right , they definitely did that . 
  who 's talking about handing out citizenships ? 
  ... but , according to russia , not assad . 
  that is , the cunt who started this war in the first place . 
  you 're assuming i support a quick solution and therefore a , shall we say , _ final _ solution . 
  i believe this assumption says more about you than about me . 
  a sustainable deconversion process would take generations . 
  raise living standards , provide viable alternatives , stuff like that . 
  but no , i must be _ obviously _ advocating genocide because some people do n't grok long-term thinking . 
  am i , really now ? 
  because _ kinder , k\u00fcche , kirche _ better demonstrates the time commitment required past the initial shag ? 
  history , yay !, 
   well then how about we just breed more ? 
  force women to have more children ? 
   or have a government program that encourages it ? 
  we have those , they are n't effective enough . 
   or reduce government spending so that we do n't need so many people to tax . 
  sudden drop in retirees ' living standards ? 
  they vote , y' know . 
   there are all sorts of options you can look at before selecting the one of replacing the native population . 
  _ replacing . _ all or nothing , huh ? 
  how about _ augmenting _ or _ supplementing _ or _ reinforcing _ ? 
  because it 's the `` white countries '' that have demographic problems ? 
   the question , then . 
  is what happens if you suddenly take a large body of water and dump it in the river . 
  all rivers need a continuous supply of fresh water , or they 'll dry up . 
  the main concern should not be keeping fresh water out , it should be keeping the riverbed solid enough that the new water does n't force sudden , drastic changes but gets carried by the already present flow . 
  it has to be , shall we say , assimilated ? 
  water is important , but it 's not important past having enough of it to constitute a river ; water alone is not _ the river _ , and it 's the river that must survive . 
  if you focus on the qualities of water over those of the river you 'll end up with ... a wadi ? 
  mmkay , this analogy has officially gone too far . 
  nice point with the generations , it 's positively darwinian  the changes from one to another are small , but the differences between generations further apart are more pronounced . 
  not one of us would be welcomed as kin or kith by our ancestors just 10 or 15 generations ago -- we speak too strange a languague , have too strange habits , too strange ideas . 
  and the change has been , indeed , accelerating . 
  it follows that we ourselves ca n't know with _ any _ certainty what our descendants will speak , what they 'll do and what they 'll think in 300 years . 
  the best we can do is to identify the core values and work on strengthening those , not focus on insignificant minutiae . 
  in the survival of a culture the ancestors are of little import as long as the descendants come out alright . 
  it 's reasonable alright , it 's just not practical . 
  from what i 've observed , there are two main problems with preserving your way of life . 
  firstly , you might be trying to preserve something that was fictional in the first place , an ideal that was never real . 
  trying to recreate an imaginary utopia leads , at best , to frustration . 
  secondly , you might be trying to recreate an ideal that _ was _ real at some point , but has become inaccessible due to natural processes . 
  times change , people change , _ peoples _ change , and holding on to a moment of time only brings you further away from the now . 
  trying to preserve a way of life wholesale is a fruitless undertaking . 
   i can look past immediate unpleasant compromises for the sake of net benefits to europe and the wider world . 
  well , i see it as putting off an inconvenience today whilst betting on it not turning into an even larger problem tomorrow . 
  which it 's likely to because a ) you just taught your opponent that belligerence gives results and b ) you just significantly increased their economic and population base . 
  edit : what you 're proposing is , in effect , a pre-emptive tactical retreat . 
  likely the first of several . 
  handing over territory and people to your opponent whenever he demands some is not a sustainable strategy . 
  check my flag , eejit . 
  i grew up next to a russian military base , and i definitely do n't want them to return - something you 'd be seemingly ok with . 
  _ apparently _ , lol .

  that would lead to voter coercion / vote buying . 
  you simply click a button and hope that the ballot will be cast as it is shown on screen , even though a piece of malware was demonstrated in 2011 that showed a ballot being cast while no ballot was actually sent out when a ` wrong ' candidate was chosen . 
  see [ the application of i-voting for estonian parliamentary elections of 2011 ] ( http://research.cyber.ee/~jan/publ/evote2011.pdf ) . 
  there are very good reasons why the scientific community is not even willing to discuss so poor voting systems . 
   really awesome only to those with very limited understanding of electronic voting and trustworthy computing . 
  see [ * broken ballots * ] ( http://www.amazon.com/dp/1575866366/ ) for background . 
  in short , there are fundamental issues that can not be overcome on today 's pcs as they are so trivially easy to compromise . 
  once a pc has been compromised , there is absolutely no guarantee that it casts a ballot as intended , or that it casts a ballot at all . 
  in estonia 's case , blind eye has been turned to these issues in the name of pr . 
  there 's no substance behind all the hype . 
   my point was that no one is forced to go to the army . 
  civil service is not the same thing . 
  forced labor , one way or another . 
   the contradiction was in you demanding fair due process for nazi criminals , as it 's `` everyone 's right '' . 
  you then claimed that it was basically good for people to get rounded up and shot in the head -- which contradicts your first statement about due process . 
  the best information available indicates that those in tartu camp ( with few exceptions ) were guilty of crimes punishable by death , and that karl linnas did not commit extrajudicial killings . 
  i am for due process in the sense that the right people get punished . 
  i do n't care how it 's formally done . 
  is it really that difficult to process that among many forced labor and death camps there were camps that actually did justice by executing marauders and murderers ? 
   i 'd like to see you claim that the la times were influenced by soviets . 
  if you honestly believe that a western journalist could have talked to anyone in the soviet union in 1987 without the kgb vetting the person beforehand , then i am dumbfounded by your naivety . 
  there 's a joke that the viru hotel in tallinn , which was used to accomodate westerners , was made of microconcrete - concrete mixed with microphones . 
  a whole floor , which as a joke still officially does n't exist , was packed with equipment to record everything that was being said and done ( the floor was recently turned into [ a museum ] ( http://www.tallinn2011.ee/%27hotel_viru_and_the_kgb__museum_opens_on_13_january ) ) . 
  everyone from prostitutes on the streetcorner to cleaning ladies were working for the kgb , and the visitors were traced wherever they went , and whatever meetings with locals they had were plays - carefully prepared for them . 
  they were living in a false reality , and being constantly manipulated by everyone around them . 
  `` western journalist freely roaming around in 1987 '' sounds like a joke in itself . 
  : ) date of the article says it all , really . 
   do you not sense how , in a profound feat of irony , you are contradicting yourself ? 
  i 'm not contradicting . 
  you seem to posess a very hollywood-esque view on a prisoner camp . 
  random people were n't rounded up and shot . 
  i am merely pointing out , that : * there is evidence that the vast majority of prisoners took part in the coup in june 1940 , or were guilty of large-scale destruction at the time of a war , and to a varying degree , of murders of civilian population . 
  their execution was the right thing to do from both legal and moral point of view . 
  * there is no evidence that karl linnas participated in extrajudicial killings or any other crimes of that sort . 
  for certain crimes , the normal mode of operation of a prisoner camp is to carry out executions . 
  being in charge of such camp is not a crime in itself , like you seem to suggest . 
   no , i do not . 
  neither does the author of the book that i linked to , by his own admission . 
  it is preposterous to request this kind of information , and you know it , of course . 
  preposterous ? 
  it is n't . 
  that information is actually publicly available in english , in one of the major publications on this topic . 
  crimes were commited by about 1000 persons , 1200 tops , who working for the civil administration . 
  civil and military branches did n't mix much , and like i pointed out - even if we assumed that everyone of them served in the 20th division , they would n't constitute more than 7 % of the total manpower at any given time . 
  so what are the remaining 93 % guilty of ? 
   i believe , however , that it was highly likely that nazi sympathisers would end up in nazi regiments . 
  crimes commited had nothing to do with nazism , it simply had no supporters and the local sd archives are littered with [ martin sandberger ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/martin_sandberger ) 's whining on the subject , especially with regard to the inability to instigate pogroms . 
  previously mentioned roland lepik , for example , did n't discriminate based on nationality or racial theories , but on the grounds of personal gain . 
  why would a profiteer want to be sent to the front ? 
   you are also defending karl linnas . 
  i 'm not . 
  i am illustrating that both the author and us courts relied on unfair trials and fabricated evidence . 
  everyone deserves a fair trial , especially those who are guilty of the most serious crimes - so that their guilt could n't be lessened by appealing on unfair trial . 
   being in charge of a concentration camp it was n't a `` concentration camp '' in hollywood sense of the word , but a temporary prisoner camp . 
  according to research , the vast majority of its occupants had been participants of so-called destruction commandos ( * h\u00e4vituspataljon * ) and deserved to be shot , about 230 were killed in total . 
  the camp became famous after a soviet investigator multiplied the width of a anti-tank trench used for executions by the length of it , and assumed that 12 000 had been murdered there . 
  soviet propaganda spinned that figure of 12 000 around until the very collapse of the country . 
  linnas ' role in the camp remains relatively unknown , since until the collapse of the soviet union , unbiased research was not possible . 
  after the collapse , research has been seriously hindered by the lack of trustworthy evidence . 
  so i hope that you do n't mind me being surprised by foreigners who know so well who-did-what . 
  merely `` guilt by position '' is not good enough for me . 
   the omakaitse members were also involved in very questionable acts . 
  those people then went on to become a part of the ss division . 
  since you seem to know this so well - how many omakaitse members were guilty of any crimes , and how many of them were drafted into 20th division ? 
  out of 15 000-20 000 men in the 20th , how many had innocent blood on their hands ? 
  even if everyone who had anything to do with crimes were conscripted , they would 've still not constituted more than 7 % of 20th division 's manpower . 
  the correct figure is likely smaller by an order of a magnitude . 
  you 're clearly stretching this too far . 
   as far as i know , there were n't any particularly kindly and pleasant concentration camp commanders . 
  then your knowledge is limited . 
  there were sadists like roland lepik ( of tartu camp ) , who was executed by his own people , and then there were commanders , who allowed soviet pows to work on farms , and thus escape camp conditions - one of such pows was the current chairman of russian veterans ' organization in tallinn , and in a recent documentary he expressed his gratitude . 
  the world is n't black and white , good and evil . 
  there are lots of shades , and the actual history is extremely delicate and complicated . 
  you ca n't blatantly stamp `` good '' or `` evil '' on large groups of people . 
   actions by countries like estonia to then attempt to go against that trend impact negatively on the overall european image , and in fact give russia the much-needed ideological ammo to accuse europe of a double standard . 
  if needed , they 'll produce their own ammo , no matter what we do . 
  and if they do n't need tension , they 'll even [ make a deal with hitler ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/molotov%e2%80%93ribbentrop_pact ) . 
  that 's politics . 
  do n't be naive . 
   the fact is , anything associated with nazism is very much frowned upon in all major european countries . 
  it is n't , really . 
  to give the clearest example - tehnically , finland was an ally of germany in [ continuation war ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/continuation_war ) , but it would be an utter nonsense to claim that there was anything wrong with what the finns did , or that they fought for hitler 's cause . 
  there was an immense number of participants in the conflict , and everyone had their own goals . 
  after the red terror in estonia in 1940-1941 , the most important goal for estonia was to keep the soviet union out of its borders , in the hope that the german retreat from the eastern front would cause a power vacuum [ just like had happened in 1918 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/estonian_war_of_independence#course_of_the_war ) in the aftermath of wwi , allowing to restore the republic of estonia . 
  it is ** vital ** to know the history of eastern europe between 1917 and 1920 to understand what goals different participants had in ww2 . 
  from this point of view , those who fought on the eastern front ( especially in [ the battle of narva ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_narva_%281944%29 ) , on of the bloodiest of the whole ww2 ) are no doubt heroes , much like they are heroes from the finnish viewpoint - the battles in north-eastern estonia gave finland [ enough leverage to find a way to peace ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/continuation_war#soviet_strategic_offensive ) . 
  oh my god what garbage that is . 
  let ' start with `` the german army entered estonia and latvia in july 1942 , a few weeks after it invaded the soviet union . '', 
  the soviet union was invaded in 1941 . 
  or : `` based on the testimony of eyewitnesses during the war crimes trials conducted in estonia in the 1960s , the nazy collaborators were brutal . '', 
  laughed at this one . 
  at the time , estonia was an occupied country with extremely powerful secret police . 
  there was no freedom of speech , strong censorship and a ban on everything that did not belong to the `` soviet way of life '' , and yes , that includes jazz . 
  to give an example of how those trials in 1960s looked like : karl linnas ' trial took place in january 1962 , and his verdict was accidentally published in the january edition of the journal of office of public procurator of the ussr - before the trial began . 
  the `` mistake '' was soon noticed . 
  old copies were rounded up and destroyed , and `` correct '' issue of the journal was printed . 
  still , you can see a copy of the `` incorrect '' journal in the [ museum of occupations ] ( http://okupatsioon.ee/en ) in tallinn . 
  : ) that verdict , however , was good enough for the us to deport linnas to the soviet union . 
  this also illustrates why the supreme court decision can not be used as a moral platform - in their naivety , north american courts relied on soviet evidence that was often nothing less than forgery . 
  see [ soviet evidence in north american courts : an analysis of problems and concerns with reliance on communist source evidence in alleged war criminal trials ] ( http://www.amazon.com/books/dp/b000by4zc4 ) for many more examples .

   they are not poor either , as i 've seen they had bmws and one is posing with loads of euro bills ( big bancnotes ) . 
  gypsies and money are a funny combination . 
  they rarely do any legal work , mostly just some schemes . 
  and when they have money they buy cars , jewellery , and fancy clothes . 
  but their houses look like they are about to collapse . 
  they never spend a cent on renovating or anything . 
  so when you have an ugly old house in your neighbourhood that has a brand new bmw in front of it , then the house probably belongs to a gypsy . 
  no , it 's for keeping the mexicans out . 
   of course there are multiple reasons , but you failed to mention the obvious one . 
  the reason numbers changed so drastically after 1933 is because of the holocaust and any other reason is negligible in comparison . 
  i did n't * fail to mention the obvious one * because it is fucking obvious . 
  stop being so fucking pedantic . 
  i think you are the one who needs a little push . 
  obviously the number of jews are down because of holocaust , but not identifying as a jew might also be a cause for the decrease of jews because there are only around 6 million jews in the world . 
  i hope i made it simple enough for you . 
  captain fucking obvious to the rescue . 
  get your priorities right, 
  i believe the norwegians are full of dope . 
  they have just managed to hide it very well . 
  it might be because many people do n't recognize themselves as jews anymore . 
  there has been a few generations since 1933 . 
  every ex-soviet state should have their own dog breed because the soviet ministry said so . 
  [ so we have an estonian hound . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/estonian_hound ), 
  probably . 
  does n't mean that people should n't have those feelings or that they are wrong in any way . 
  so what ? 
  desire for superiority is part of the human nature . 
  of course the concept of this is backwards and wrongs by todays standards and every country that still has that mentality is shunned upon . 
  but looking back when people had different morals and mentality , i see no reason why you should n't be proud of the accomplishments of your ancestors . 
  after all their actions have brought us here today . 
  no , but i understand russians who are proud . 
   there is nothing to be proud of . 
  owning half of the world * is * a thing to be proud of . 
  are n't you proud if you beat everyone else in a game of sports event ? 
  what kind of problems ? 
  so what is the point in differentiating the ` unionists ' and ` nationalists ' if what the nationalists want ca n't be achieved in legal way anyway ? 
  stop supporting the authoritarian regime then, 
  so is it possible for the parliament to pass an independence referendum and join ireland ? 
  or break off from the uk without an referendum ? 
   also , i like how you completely ignored the wrong timeline of yours no kidding ? 
  the 1946 event is just a proof that the soviet union was systematically oppressing the ukrainians , holodomor was not a random event . 
  1946-1947\u00a0800 .000 ukrainians died of hunger , the soviet union did n't give a fuck . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/soviet_famine_of_1932%e2%80%9333  the soviet famine of 1932 -- 33 affected the major grain-producing areas of the soviet union . 
  the subset of the famine within ** the ukrainian soviet socialist republic and the kuban , all of which were heavily populated by ukrainians , is referred to as holodomor . 
  ** you are right . 
  im an ignorant because im trying to reason with you . 
  holodomor happened in ukraine , thus by saying kulaks i meant ukrainian independent farmers . 
  i do n't need history lesson from a russian , i can read fairy tales from elsewhere . 
  in the old english ` wer ' meant ` man ' . 
  * wer * ewolf basically means man-wolf . 
  the word ` man ' meant human . 
  because rooting out `` nationalist '' elements in soviet union was a good excuse for killing people they did n't like . 
  holodomor was ideologically aimed towards rooting out ukrainians as such . 
   that being said , kulaks are a class . 
  yes , they were targeted . 
  it 's literally the whole reason behind communism . 
  they are the `` bourgeois . '', 
  does n't mean what the soviet union did was n't genocide . 
  '' . . acts committed with intent to destroy , in whole or in part , a national , ethnical , racial or religious group '' the targets of holodomor were kulaks , who were ukrainian independent farmers , and `` nationalist '' people . 
  the hardest year was 1946 , yet the soviet union gave france , bulgaria , czechoslovakia , romania , and poland 105000 tons of grain . 
  it falls under un definition of a genocide . 
  hopefully an average swedish man has more pride than you do . 
  you would think that finland would go on the offensive if russia were to attack sweden from the sea ? 
  this would be exactly what russia wants . 
  it 's far from being a symbolic gesture . 
  it 's a foreign policy decision , the stance portugal took will have an effect on their foreign relations . 
   bad agricultural policies enforced forcibly taking away peoples food and seeds during a famine is not a policy . 
  it 's murder . 
  actually we have a permission by the netherlands to call them holland . 
  babies and disabled people are usually not included in such statistics . 
  bosnia and herzegovina is basically a two-state system . 
  make your guess .

   ad hominems that 's what im here for .

  * people * do n't care . 
  the hivemind of reddit does . 
  does n't happen with estonian youth , wont happen with swedish . 
  what ... ? 
   actually , such aid is the best way to stabilize countries and prevent wars and terrorism . 
  yeah . . no . 
  humanitarian aid is material and logistic assistance that is a short term solution until the government can offer the same . 
  development aid is meant to solve socioeconomic issues . 
  none of them offer political stability . 
  syria was fine , their gdp per capita was the same as albania . 
  did they end up in civil war and constant terrorism because they did n't receive development and humanitarian aid ? 
  why is n't albania in chaos ? 
  the eu * needs * to pay its fair share . 
  development and humanitarian aid is not protecting us . 
  of course it was a traumatic experience , but he did n't lost his child .

  scandinavian justice system is built for petty criminals , not mass murderers . 
  i seriously doubt that any of the victims family is happy with the treatment breivik is getting . 
   estonia ca n't sort out it 's issues with statelessness for decades now ... 
  there is nothing to sort out . 
  a country should n't force citizenship onto people .

  yeah , the `` average '' sucks and really does n't tell us anything . 
  for example te median net worth of an australian is ten time the median net worth of someone in the us . 
  but `` average '' shows us that an `` average '' american is ~ 10 000 dollars wealthier than an `` average '' australian . 
  russia has highest level of wealth inequality and it 's boosting the gdp up . 
  an average russian is a lot poorer than an average latvian . 
  russias `` doorstep '' . 
  ca n't titles get any more provocative ? 
  besides poland is nobodys doorstep . 
  it 's an independent country that should n't be treated as a doorstep or a border to another country .

  we had that with our previous president too . 
  i do n't understand this . 
  i think it 's great that the head of the state is also a human being . 
  its power is still weak , the commission has a near monopoly over the legislative initiative . 
  why do you think why countries send politicans who they want to get rid of to the ep ? 
  like farage . 
  european parliament has power only in theory . 
  practically they are there just to give an illusion of some sort of democracy .

  miss france was dark , because french guiana is also france . 
  a black girl winning the title of miss helsinki is the same as a man winning this title . 
  no it is not . 
  welfare state is a general term . 
  i 'll remind you that we are living in the 21st century . 
  what defined nationalism during the french revolution is no longer relevant today . 
  even during the ww2 and interwar period the defenitions were different than today . 
   patriotism is similar insofar as it emphasizes strong feelings for one 's country , but it does not necessarily imply an attitude of superiority . 
  nationalism is so far apart from patriotism . 
  first of all nationalism is more of an ideology . 
  an ideology that insists on the greatness of the country and the superiority of its people . 
  patriotism is simply love of ones country and its * good * deeds and accomplishments . 
  you wouldnt sing the anthem if you despise your country . 
  i am proud to call myself a patriot of my country and hometown , but i definitely am not a nationalist . 
  what does this have to do with anything ? 
  there is no clear definition of a welfare state . 
  but its fundamental aspect is that the state is taking responsibility of the social-economic security of their citizens through policies and social systems . 
  i ca n't really think of a single european country that completely neglects its citizens . 
  nationalism is an ideology , patriotism is a positive attitude towards their country or region . 
  patriotism is pride towards the culture and accomplishments of the country . 
  no they are not . 
  people sing the national anthem before the football match because of patriotism . 
  people celebrate independence day because of patriotism . 
  you have the flag of your country as your flair because of patriotism . 
   install welfare state what does that even mean ? 
  almost every country in europe is a welfare state . 
  nationalism is being blindly proud about everything your country does or has ever done . 
  patriotism is being proud of the good things your country has done . 
  i think if your country used to be the seat of the roman empire is then it is something to be proud of . 
  you dare say all of this is nationalism ? 
  92 % of them are albanian anyway . 
  damn people age fast in romania,

  the average quality of life and income has risen in every country that has joined the eu . 
  getting closer with the eu rather than russia is more beneficial to ukraine in every possible aspect . 
  russia is a poor and corrupt oligarchy and so is ukraine , but the association agreement is a step to the right direction . 
  getting closer to the eu is within the interests with the ukraine . 
  getting closer with russia is within the interests of oligarchs and poor old fucks who just do n't know any better . 
  so no , absolutely no sympathy for them .

  this man had a villa with golden furniture . 
  this is not the consenquence of maidan .

  the murderers do n't feel sorry , they feel superior . 
  and do n't pretend this was a random event . 
  it was sparked by a murder,

  and the expenses saved on alcohol , eating in restaurants , haircuts in tallinn etc would help balance it out . 
  on the other hand by 2030 the prices will probably have equalized more . 
  that 's what i 've heard the experience was for the people i know who went from tallinn to study in a finnish university . 
  i myself lack this experience . 
  however , i can test myself by going to [ yle.fi ] ( http://yle.fi ) and opening a random article , odds are good that i 'll instantly understand about half the words that are written , and the word endings of words i do n't know , enough to draw conclutions about the context of a sentance , the rest is giberish . 
  i think it 's a fairly fair estimate about written language , but to give more leeway , let 's say maybe 30-50 % compared to something like chinese ? 
  spoken language is a different beast though . 
  what would you say is a good comparison match , italian and spanish ? 
  probably not quite the same level as danish and swedish ? 
  both estonians and finns are finnic people and speak finnic languages , which are very closely related and do n't belong to the indo-european language family . 
  for example an estonian who moves to finland can probably understand about half the words , and then learns to speak the language in a month or so . 
  culture-wise were very closely related until ww2 , now we 're also very related , but finns will definitely also notice the influence of ussr when visiting our country . 
  an example about the closeness can be drawn from the fact that both use the same melody for anthem . 
  between world wars finland was also considered a baltic state ( so two finnic : estonia & finland and two balts : latvia & lithuania ) . 
  after ww2 finland remained independent and started shifting towards the scandinavian , and thus nordic council was born . 
   tallinn and helsinki seem to be closer to the coast than london & paris are . 
  on the coast . 
   how long does it take to get from riga to tallinn ? 
  do they run express trains ? 
  [ rail baltica ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rail_baltica ) should make trains happen . 
  turns out they estimate the passenger traffic volumes to be similar too . 
   11 million workers would be travelling back and forth between helsinki and tallinn each year , or about 25,000 people a day [ channel tunnel had 10 million travellers in 2014 . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/channel_tunnel#passenger_traffic_volumes ) interesting stuff , similar estimates even though one is between a country of 60 million and a continent , and the other pretty much combines two ^ small cities into one ( living in one , working in the other becomes feasible ) . 
  makes sense . 
  estonians are not technically [ baltic people ( balts ) ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/balts ) . 
  but our country is , geographically baltic . 
  sure you did n't mix up import/export/total ? 
  seems very similar to the import stats ... anyway , interesting . 
  i copied the info from wikipedia economy of [ estonia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/economy_of_estonia ) / [ latvia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/economy_of_latvia ) . 
  no idea . 
  latvia 's export partners : ** russia 18.3 % ** lithuania 15.0 % estonia 12.0 % germany 7.2 % poland 5.6 % sweden 4.8 % estonia 's main export partners : sweden 18.5 % finland 15.8 % latvia 11.1 % ** russia 10.0 % ** lithuania 5.5 % germany 5.0 %, 
  absolutely , 
  as an estonian who lived in china for a year -- spot on . 
  germany and france they have stereotypes about ( `` good cars !, 
  '' , `` very beautiful '' respectively ) , the rest is usually a blur . 
  i even met one factory worker who seemingly drew a blank when he was explained what or where europe was , although i guess it may have been a translation issue . 
  just to counter the anecdote : we did also become friends with young people who downloaded american tv shows and movies , could effortlessly participate in making jokes that included typical western culture references , spoke perfect english , one guy even knew estonian flag colors from his interest in football etc. 
  talking of us , in europe museums mostly have an entrance fee , i was very impressed to realize [ the largest museums in washington dc ] ( http://smithsonianassociates.org/ticketing/help/locations/maps/mallmapweb.jpg ) were completely free .

  the 1938 numbers get posted a lot , and it has always annoyed me because baltics are lumped together into a weird number , so here 's some extra info about the estonian number . 
  :d  [ here 's a research about the state of economy and gdp in the inter-war period in estonia ( source is pdf in estonian ) ] ( http://www.arhiiv.ee/public/tuna/artiklid_biblio/klesmentmartin_eesti_majandusarengu_tuna2008_1_1.pdf ) with graphs and everything . 
   between 1924 and 1926 we were ** above finland in gdp per capita ** , but onwards after 1927 we were ** always lurking behind finland by about 15 % ** . 
  our gdp per capita was twice lower than denmark . 
  sweden and norway stayed between denmark and finland . 
  we were constantly ahead of poland and ** after 1935 ** our gdp per capita ** passed that of czechoslovakia ** . 
  gdp per capita was n't used before ww2 so it 's obviously notoriously difficult to make any accurate assessments , but according to the same study [ the difference between estonia and finland would 've been 2700 vs 3500 ] ( http://www.arhiiv.ee/public/tuna/artiklid_biblio/klesmentmartin_eesti_majandusarengu_tuna2008_1_1.pdf ) [ `` geary-khamis '' dollars ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/geary%e2%80%93khamis_dollar ) . 
  or in other words , ca 78 % of that of finland , which means roughly ** at about 776 on op 's map ** . 
  and they 're all lumped together . 
  those ridiculous 1938 estimation stats have emerged multiple times previously in this subreddit and each time they 've been criticised a lot .

  which is still nice .

  / r/nordicunion, 
  and here i am , thinking '' ... why lithuania ? '', 
  wtf , how so ? 
  you 're joking but the truth is estonia has been very active in all sorts of nato and eu missions in the past , and there 's already rumours about it : [ estonia eyes engagement against isis ] ( http://news.postimees.ee/3375405/estonia-eyes-engagement-against-isis ) . 
   i have no fucking clue what the bigger spot between us is supposed to be . 
  v\u00f5ru / v\u00f5ro  a completely absurd notion to list them as separatists of course . 
  personally i feel them and the islanders are pretty much the most estonian of the estonians around . 
  it does indeed say that even on their homepage , so let 's see : the tv tower viewing platform is at 170m ( of the ~ 300m tower ) and the highest points of helsinki are at 90m , with average of the city at 26m . 
  this gives us a maximum visible distance for the highest points of helsinki exactly at 80km and 65km for the average helsinki elevation . 
  helsinki 's distance from tallinn is ~ 82km . 
  but there 's also [ atmospheric refraction ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/atmospheric_refraction ) that needs to be counted in , making it very plausible . 
  blast , our real reasons for it advancements have been discovered !, 
  taking off from tallinn airport on a clear day one can easily see helsinki on the other side , it 's especially noticeable with city lights still on . 
  first time it was very surprising to see how close the cities really are . 
  [ legally it 's way more complicated ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/state_continuity_of_the_baltic_states ) . 
  in case of estonia and latvia the independence was never been suspended * de jure * and thus the re-independence after ussr brought on a continuation of the state . 
  lithuania on the other hand proclaimed re-establishment of the state . 
  edit : just realised you probably meant finnish autonomy before independent state ? 
  if so nvm , 
  iceland , too , has migrated quite a lot . 
  hmm , [ maybe so , yep ] ( http://img01.militaryblog.jp/usr/c/a/m/camouniform/estonian_estdcu_shirt.jpg ) . 
  estdcu , digital camo uniform , nothing too special about it , it 's quite similar to what canadians use , but it replaced the old soviet looking amoeba patterns giving it a small symbolic value . 
  besides [ the new ones look way cooler in comparison ] ( http://f6.pmo.ee/f/2014/02/23/2848464t151ha4f3.jpg ) , lush dark green . 
  :d it 's 25 % . 
  [ also , around 3500 came from estonia ( at one point 10 % of finnish navy was estonian ) , it was said `` for finland 's freedom and estonian honour '' .

   should our media simply call them africans , since they apparently have little to do with the usa i 'm sorry , but even if you are going berserk with this and actually claim that they have less to do with the us than the white population , the situation is incomparable with estonia , where the russian minority is very new and their being here is considered to have happened as a crime against international law as an assimilation policy during an illegal foreign occupation . 
   and they are not really descendants of the mayflower pilgrims ? 
  and what percentage of the us population is ? 
  most of the butthurt before ww2 was against germans you know . 
  but then the fire nation attacked ... 
  oh indeed , silly me . 
  wow ... 
  just a historical coincidence that the butthurt belt is the one that has experience with russian forces ... 
  they do n't . 
  it was a massive contribution , yet an equally evil one to nazi germany . 
  plus , the soviets wasted their men like cannon fodder . 
  plus one should not forget the massive us technical aid to the ussr . 
  the mentality of [ that moment ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwmbvnsmsww ) was not that far off . 
  in defense , you can select similar pictures from most post-socialist countries ... 
  and used the word * seltsimehed * for other estonians ... 
   but the military did leave afterwards . 
  in 1993 from lithuania and 1994 from estonia and latvia ... 
  ah , the mythical '' [ white ship ] ( http://www.estonica.org/en/waiting_for_the_white_ship/ ) '', 
   i am sure the czechs appreciated the difference . 
  of course it did n't matter for the locals , but still - even from my anti-soviet view , the ussr can not be blamed for some german crime the ussr did n't previously agree to . 
  yet imagine a world where nazi germany and the ussr would have remained allies , together with fascist italy and japan . 
  i think the horrors of world war ii were even an easy way out ... 
  ethnicity and nationality are two different things . 
  if you lived in estonia , you would understand that it 's very much like two different societies here with relatively little interaction between them . 
  so even if we see `` an estonian '' committing a crime somewhere , it 's very much the `` not us , but them '' feeling . 
   unless you are suggesting that there are absolutely no thieves among ethnic estonians i am definitely not suggesting that and i assume the rate is higher than most of europe , but if non-estonians [ i.e. 
  mostly russians ] make up 1/3 of your country 's population , but make up about 60 % of your country 's prison population , then you get sort of a well-founded bias about the situation . 
  basically a small city state in a tourist riviera like monaco is `` even more forgotten by tourists '' , while in reality the country is like majority tourists at any time . 
  that 's a rather idiotic use of words , do n't you think ? 
  i do not disagree that estonia is considered to be a baltic state by many as it 's a convenient oversimplification when one looks at a map and when one only knows the fact that all three were occupied by the ussr . 
  i do think it 's an oversimplification and simply factually incorrect when somebody calls estonians balts , but i do n't want to lose my sanity arguing with everyone calling estonia a baltic sate . 
  at times and in a certain context ( defense , singing revolution ) i use it myself . 
  i do n't justify any collaborators , who collaborated willingly . 
  i do think that most of both pro-soviet and pro-nazi soldiers/auxiliaries did not do it willingly as they were mostly conscripts , who were ordered to commit crimes in the name of an occupying foreign power . 
  the only difference here is that for estonians and in the context of estonia in world war ii , after the horrible year of soviet occupation , which happened before any nazi occupation - the soviets were worse than the nazis . 
  this does n't say anything good about the nazis , yet it portrays how badly estonians really thought of the soviets . 
  if the annexation was illegal , then the occupation status would simply never end . 
  note that this would n't have been the case hundreds of years ago as conquest was a legal way of politics , but as war as a political tool had been banned for long before the ussr invaded estonia , then it would have forever been considered an illegal occupation . 
  and by what subjective standards of yours am i misusing the word ? 
  i am using it in the context of international law , which i have studied and gotten a degree in law , so i do know what i 'm talking about . 
  even i have one roll at home . 
  have n't used it yet though , i am too afraid of an unexpected invasion . 
  international political narrative and the narrative of the academia . 
  yeah , nothing to do with the real definition of the word . 
  it 's still weird and incorrect . 
  not that anyone in estonia would see a negative connotation with the word , it just does n't apply to estonians and it 's weird to see people label us like that . 
  they considered the soviets to be necessary allies as [ looking from the west ] , the nazis were a more imminent threat . 
  literal revisionism . 
  you use that word too easily . 
  illegal annexation counts for occupation . 
  narrative indeed , but not factual truth . 
  i have been there several times , why would n't i , i am a tallinner . 
  but i ca n't see why the same logic would n't apply to different occupations . 
   and yet it saved civilization from an even bigger evil . 
  perhaps , perhaps not . 
  we do n't know that and we never will . 
  but we do know that the soviet union occupied half of europe for close to 50 years , murdered , imprisoned and deported its peoples to siberia , destroyed their economies and almost led the world to a nuclear war . 
   next you 're gon na say churchill and roosevelt were soviet apologists as well . 
  why in seven hells would i say that ? 
  if a country is higher in the tourist ranking than its population ranking , then how is that country `` largely forgotten by tourists '' ? 
  true , except conscripting men from an occupied territory is a crime against international law . 
   unaccepptable by modern civilizational standards . 
  factual comparison is now unacceptable in the modern civilization ? 
   but yes , i suppose it 's nazi apologism if these countries do n't see their liberation to have been that . 
  that must have been sarcasm . 
   sacrifice and the biggest favour that country even did to humanity and europe . 
  of co-starting the war , invading innocent countries , collaborating with the nazis , murdering , imprisoning and deporting millions of innocent people to siberia , throwing their soldiers against german forces with horrible tactics and letting their own men die like cannon fodder , and then occupying half of europe for close to 50 years and almost leading the world into a nuclear war ?? 
  a great sacrifice indeed ... 
   instead of remembering estonians who fought for the red army most of them were conscripts , who did n't choose the red army and many died in labor battalions as estonian units were not trusted by the soviets - plus many defected to either finland or over the german line . 
  there really is no pro-soviet stance among estonians whatsoever . 
  estonians are not balts , mind that !, 
  there 's a bit of a difference in causing the soviet havoc yourself and getting in the middle of a fight between two totalitarian dictatorships . 
  first of all , you are forgetting that most estonian soldiers in the ss were conscripts , who did n't have the choice of fighting or not . 
  and you really sound like a stalinist apologist here ... 
  german coins about them liberating tallinn , riga and vilnius would technically be just as correct ... 
  how is replacing one hostile occupation with another a liberation ? 
  did the nazis liberate estonia in 1941 then ? 
   fascism killed people on racial grounds , it was institutionalized racism . 
  communism did not . 
  is it that hard to understand ? 
  why is killing people on racist grounds worse than killing people on social and ethnic grounds ??? 
   thats why the swastika is banned , while the hammer and sickle is not in most countries swastika is banned because it was banned right after the war . 
  the hammer and sickle were symbols of a technical ally and an existing sovereign state for a long time . 
  plus , in many countries there is a widespread lack of knowledge about communist crimes , that 's why these symbols are not banned . 
   playing genocide olympics is pointless fair enough and for me it does n't matter if a regime murdered 20 or 50 million people , at some point from hundreds of thousands we can classify any such regime as an enemy of humanity , but if there are still people arguing that fascism was the sole worst thing in the world , then for me , my ancestors and my countrymen , who died among millions under the soviet regime , such an understanding is purely insulting and i will fight against this widespread misconception at any cost !, 
  wow ... 
  so anyone stating facts whereby another regime was even worse than the nazi regime , is suddenly `` nazi apologism '' and `` historical revisionism '' ?? 
  i said nothing good of the nazi regime , nor denied the amount of people the regime murdered . 
  it seems that it 's you , who lacks knowledge about communism and the soviet union ... and in this case ** historical revisionism is needed ** as communist crimes were hidden and whitewashed away for decades . 
   and i suspect that this behaviour comes from older beefs in the region and/or willingness to fight alongside germans germans were seen as the `` historical enemy '' of estonians for close to 700 years . 
  it even lasted during the estonian war of independence , where most of the war was fought against russian bolsheviks , but a side campaign was fought against local and real german forces in latvia and the victory over the germans later became the estonian victory day . 
  that more or less all changed in 1940-1941 thanks to the soviet occupation . 
  in one horrible year people started to hate the russian regime more than the regime that held estonians as serfs , who could n't even leave their villages for close to 600 years . 
   even if the soviets killed more people in estonia not just in estonia , but in the world and in europe as well . 
  now if they killed more people , then how come fascism is still the worst enemy of humanity ? 
   estonians were evidently more willing to fight as terrorist `` forest '' bands against soviet power even into the 50s , while not doing much against the german occupiers it was because although the german occupation was a totalitarian regime , estonians were not that much repressed per se and the memory of the horrible year of soviet occupation was still fresh in memory . 
  for many , the german occupation really did seem like a liberation , or at least a change to a more liberal regime ... 
  the question you should be asking is not `` why did estonians think nazism was a more liberal regime '' , but `` what did the soviets do for estonians to think like that ? '', 
   luckily the mainstream sentiment in western europe is far from that . 
  that is slowly beginning to change and more and more people agree that communism was just as bad as fascism , if not worse .

  immigrants then . 
  situation on the ground is the balance of powers on the estonian-russian border , not how many people live in new york city ... 
  the holocaust was also good for nazi germany at the time ? 
  russia caused the tension , we need protection , end of story . 
   all ganging up on they are ? 
  the reality is situation on the ground , not a hypothetical sum of populations . 
   when you look at reality , russia doesnt stand much of a chance does it , quickly conquering estonia and then threatening with a nuclear war - yeah , they can get away with it if they want to and if they 're lucky . 
  because russia is a hostile nation and has far more troops at nato borders . . 
  i am aware of that , though it does seem weird that some territories were just left out of nato . 
  no , you did n't answer my question . 
  if there is no obligation to defend these spanish territories , then there is no obligation , period . 
  the question is rather , why were these territories excluded and do the spaniards actually wait nato to respond nevertheless without an obligation to defend these territories ? 
  what were the initial reasons why the spanish communities in africa were left out of the defense obligation ? 
   i think it is fair , but we can agree to disagree . 
  i do n't think it 's particularly sane , but it 's not unfair either . 
  oh yes , indeed . 
  then how is that really supposed to be like ? 
  does spain still wait for nato members to come for aid to protect these cities ? 
   none of them committed to send troops if the conflict escalated . 
  so there 's a fair amount of skepticism . 
  there is no requirement to explicitly `` commit sending troops in a possible scenario '' . 
  if you invoke article 5 , then other members will come to aid in whatever amount spain asks . 
  do n't worry , there are no more african countries at eurovision . 
  they ca n't hurt you no more , 
  depends on the need . 
  nato does n't really work that in any situation all members should offer direct assistance , but if actual need arises , then yes , they most likely would . 
  it is a running joke for several decades in estonia that finns are either called * poro * ( finnish for `` reindeer '' ) or * p\u00f5drad * ( estonian for `` moose '' ) . 
  i just used it [ a couple of days ago ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/58omcx/offensive_humor_thread/d922tga/ ) for example . 
  create ? 
  i thought import was the new create . 
  very small share of the population actually living in the european part . 
  do n't worry , finland is still the only country ever to have lost to an african country at eurovision . 
  and ? 
  it 's not just about putin , it 's about the imperialist mindset of the russian public . 
  why would they visit a failed , betraying and secessionist pro-nazi country that rightfully belongs to russia and who basically tries to exterminate local russians ? 
  such a sentiment wo n't change much with putin out of power . . 
  drunk people are rather pathetic with knives . 
  they will most likely just hurt themselves . 
  no , it 's the [ tactical enemy `` red '' ] ( http://rapla.kaitseliit.ee/files/rapla/img/files/soduri_kasiraamat_2013.pdf ) ( p. 148 ) . 
   ~ ~ countries no one jokes about ( or cares for ) ~ ~ countries that are nobody 's first choice of jokes : ftfy, 
  you 're living the dream , man !, 
  estonians speak slowly and have long vocals and consonants , hence the double letters . 
  but the estonian driver was either so stoic that he answered the hitchhiker 's question as plainly as possible , or he did n't like the hitchhiker and intentionally drove him in the wrong direction away from tallinn . 
  why would you joke about the swedes , when you have [ the finns ] ( http://f.pmo.ee/f/2015/09/09/4468543t81h740e.jpg ) just across the gulf ? 
  do n't joke with such things , the comments will usually close in just six months !, 
  your flag was meant for us and you stole it !, 
  at least write tallin ** n ** correctly , dear six-toed neighbor !, 
  :d but the joke works best with a hitchhiking tourist from [ insert unliked country x ] . 
  tourist : yis tallyinn far yet ? 
  * half an hour passes * hitchhiker : yis tallyinn far yet ? 
  * another half an hour passes * hitchhiker : yi 'm sorry , yis tallyinn far yet ?? 
  estonian : yess . 
  as we discussed in the mapporn post , estonians may very well mostly joke about ourselves as well , although we have tons of well-defined jokes about finns and latvians too . 
  it is consistent with the graph data of estonia . 
  i made a joke ? 
  indeed , there is a separate 140 days paid leave for mothers exclusively , and 10 work days for fathers exclusively . 
  would be * kuum koer * in estonian , but everyone says the english name . 
  [ this one ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mf5bhz87czs ) is more impressive i think . 
  no soviet/russian leader has ever set foot in independent estonia as much as i know . 
  and probably wo n't in any foreseeable future either . . 
   also eesti you 're eastern european not nordic . 
  nice bias ... 
  the sauna originates from estonia and finland and perhaps close neighboring areas . 
  well , we have sauna , where there is no limit to freedom of expression . 
  i think it 's general post-socialist thing , i presume the results would be the same either in estonia or in the czech republic etc. 
   we call them mountains in our language . 
  yeah , same here :d, 
  it snowed in tallinn , estonia as well . 
  most of it has melted by now though . 
  yeah i 'm pretty sure the clergy would go to jail for that too . 
  sad to say i have done it too when i was younger . 
  in fact , i can still see people doing it every time i go out on town . 
  on friday evenings all pubs are so full in the old town that there are few toilets to use , so if you 're desperate , anything goes i guess . . 
  yeah the clergy would definitely go to jail for that . . 
  what are you on about ? 
  i presume many western europeans did n't know about this cartoon . 
   even more evil ? 
  than nazi germany ? 
  yes !, 
   sure , the soviet union killed more people than germany exactly . 
   but just do n't ...  but nazi germany was only a nation for a decade and the ussr did most of the killing also in one decade and lived off the results of these killings ever after that . 
  there is no reason to think that germany would have continued with such mass killings had they `` succeeded '' in their endeavors . 
   nazi germany tried to take over a continent and the ussr did n't ? 
   wipe a people off the face of the earth with industrial slaughter the ussr basically destroyed many smaller ethnic groups ...  the roman empire may have killed more people in its history than nazi germany , but does that make it more evil ? 
  while that is true , i 'd like to remember you that the stalinist period did n't exactly last 70 years either . 
  same in estonian ( * t\u0161ehhi * ) . 
  holy heck , i had totally forgotten about those . 
  i think they 're a little too old to be from my childhood , but i think i 've played with them once or twice . 
  [ this ] ( https://oldmikepunch.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/brick_game.jpg ) is the earliest handheld electronic game i really remember from my childhood . 
  for western europeans , who perhaps do n't get the reference , it is the main antagonist from [ * nu , pogodi * ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5srtdctviw ) ( `` well , just you wait !, 
  '' ) , the famous soviet cartoon once popular throughout the eastern bloc . 
  it 's basically the soviet version of [ wile e. coyote and the road runner ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wile_e._coyote_and_the_road_runner ) with the same kind of structure in every episode . 
  not that this matters after such grave crimes anyway , but i was just commenting on the number of persecuted people . 
  lol . 
  the purpose is that they were as evil or even a more evil regime while not committing an act that can be described as a genocide in the legal sense . 
  according to russian standards , a threat to russian neighbors could only be confirmed retroactively after the threat has materialized itself . 
   the holocaust , as a crime , is in a league of its own . 
  it really is not . 
  it was ** a ** genocide . 
  the soviets committed waves of crimes against humanity themselves , but they were n't necessarily genocides in the legal sense of the word .

  you should learn [ some history ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/state_continuity_of_the_baltic_states ) . 
  sovereign state = / = country . 
  one could say that estonia was unified into a country-like structure in 1917 and it declared independence in 1918 . 
  but i still do n't see where you 're going with this . 
   nobody would be able to tell that i 'm half-russian mixed people are rarely unintegrated though . 
  i do n't think anyone here would consider a half-russian as a non-estonian . 
   lambaste the russian minority yes , for a good reason . 
  if you find any instance of a bad reason , do let me know and i will correct myself and apologize !, 
   meanwhile , the other russian minorities who do n't talk about that , nobody notices they are ethnically russian . 
  and i wholeheartedly agree with this statement . 
  it 's a conundrum , is n't it ? 
  on one hand , the russian minority would like to be considered `` estonians '' , but we would not do that unless the person is integrated . 
  and if the person is integrated , then we do n't see this person as a non-estonian anymore . 
  yet there remains a huge number of ethnic russians , who are unintegrated and who we do n't consider estonians . 
  99 % if not 100 % of our problems with russians are with those russians , who are unintegrated and it is quite obvious that we stigmatize and generalize this group as `` the russians '' , despite them not encompassing the entire ethnic minority . 
  but i do n't mean that anyone should hide their heritage either - just be a proud `` different kind '' of russian until more russians become like this and the unintegrated bunch becomes the `` different kind '' . 
  lol the russian downvoting brigade seems to have a busy friday evening , 
  what do you think is a country ? 
  or what exactly are you saying here ? 
   russian minorities are sick of being viewed as the enemy despite the fact that they 've lived in estonia ( or any other country ) for their whole lives . 
  then they should stop acting like an enemy . 
   i 'm half russian , but you 'd never be able to tell , and nobody i know really knows that because i do n't talk about it , because to me , it does n't matter what ethnicity you are . 
  and i hate being told that i 'm the enemy . 
  if you 're not , then nobody will say it . 
  if you act like one , then of course we will say it . 
  plus , we are sort of sick of ethnic russians damaging the image of our country and for creating so many social problems . 
  now of course i am not saying this is the fault of every single russian , but still the fault of a majority of them . 
  a 20 minute bus ride to the city center . 
  leaves every 6 minutes in the morning and i only have to walk like three minutes from both stops . 
  yes , it arose from the sea in 1917 . 
  i only do it in topics where the russian minority has a remarkably worse `` score '' and therefore influence the `` score '' of the entire country . 
  if you do n't know about estonia , its history and society , perhaps your empty criticism is n't appreciated ? 
  i 'm pretty sure estonia existed before 1918 . 
  because they are a reason for so many of our social problems . 
  this is no imagination , this is simple statistics . 
  in this particular case the question was which towns are poorest and trashiest . 
  the only real answer here is that it 's the towns where russians are in the majority . 
  these are new towns with very few older buildings [ left ] . 
  you being self-righteous here makes you look rather pathetic . 
  still finland . 
   14 days and that is it ? 
  all they get ? 
  that 's as much as in slovenia with 20 days . 
  but the minimum they get is 14 +7 +7 , not 14 +14 . 
   like if your spouse dies or you get married ? 
  erm , no . 
  obviously you take a day off , but you need to clear it with your employer . 
  everyone is obliged to take 14 days in a row , so that must include at least one weekend , but usually means two . 
  for the rest , the employer is not obliged to agree with holidays shorter than 7 days , so that must include at least one weekend as well .

  wow , andorra . 
  why would someone get sick from that ? 
  in estonia it does include weekends and that 's why it 's 28 days . 
  the unused part of vacation is transferred to the next year . 
  the soviet occupation definitely played a role , but religion was n't particularly important before either . 
  estonians themselves became more devoutly christian only with the appearance of the [ moravian church ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/moravian_church ) in the 18th century . 
  before that christianity was seen as something forced-upon and its following was strongly interlinked with old pagan beliefs .

  tallinn is perfect for a visit and plenty of people would like it here , but for many estonians it 's too big already , plus the other mentioned problems , 
  i have n't yet , but i will most likely visit nyc in autumn . 
  all school holidays are national . 
  lol, 
  i have sort of a love and hate relationship with tallinn . 
  on one hand i know the city very well as i 've grown up here and it has plenty of beautiful areas and it 's nice to see constant development . 
  on the other hand i long for living in tartu . 
  tallinn is too big for me , everyone is always in a rush and your friends are often too busy to meet up , plus hearing russian everywhere around you occasionally makes you feel like you 're not living in an estonian city anymore . 
  it 's a combination of a [ concert hall ] ( http://g3.nh.ee/images/pix/file64215073_59f99b94.jpg ) and an [ ice rink ] ( http://g4.nh.ee/images/pix/file26654_5.900x.jpg ) . 
  [ here ] ( https://register.muinas.ee/content/monument/regular/35590.jpg ) is the plan of the building . 
  it is also being used for the only heliport in estonia . 
  it has been closed for a while as it 's deteriorating . 
  the society is sort of divided on what to do with it . 
  plenty of people including me would want to see it demolished , while mostly ethnic russians and the estonian youth , who do n't automatically connect it with the brutality of the soviet era , would like to preserve it . 
  sadly , the pro-russian party is in power both in tallinn and in the national government , so they decided to toss a whopping 100 million euros into its reconstruction . 
  i also found a [ cool clip ] ( https://youtu.be/mmupdiixazs?t=3m15s ) about wandering the building .

  [ ancient history ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ancient_history ) is usually the time before middle ages and [ prehistory ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/prehistory ) is the time before recorded history .

  so the confusion is easy to arise . 
  ah , i presume the sagas were mostly after the scandinavian viking era , that which was called the viking era here ( c. 1050-1200 ) . 
  is the viking age really considered ancient history in norway ?

  there are . . the philippines ... 
  i 'm sure that christians from more conservative countries would integrate a lot more easily into the local european society and would not remain that conservative among the more liberal christians . 
  ok , we 're not . 
  and religious people in estonia are rarely that conservative . 
   * mainstream * christianity !, 
  if mainstream christianity was as conservative as islam , we would be christianophobic ...

  names in estonia are a mess because almost no estonians use russian names and no russians use estonian names , but russian names vary very little if compared to estonian names , so the top names list is always a mess : male : rasmus , artjom , robin , martin , oliver , romet , sebastian , robert , artur and maksim , of which artjom and maksim are solely russian names . 
  female : sofia , eliise , maria , mia , lisandra , mirtel , sandra , emma , laura and darja , of which sofia and darja are solely russian names . 
  martin used to dominate the male names for like 20 years , but nowadays far too many have that name , so it 's not that popular anymore . 
  there are no endemic animals in estonia , there 's only [ one plant species ] ( https://et.wikipedia.org/wiki/saaremaa_robirohi ) that exists only on saaremaa island . 
  for some reason very few know the geographical difference of the words `` elk '' and `` moose '' and always say `` moose '' as it is a far more distinct word . 
  usually it 's just * poiss/t \u00fcdruk * ( `` boy/girl '' ) , but girls have other names for boyfriends like * peika * ( short from * peigmees * - `` groom '' ) or * kutt * ( `` bloke '' ) . 
  girlfriends are sometimes called * neiu * ( `` young lady '' ) . 
  to differentiate from other boys , girls , grooms , blokes and young ladies , people usually say * minu * ( `` mine '' ) for your own and * oma * ( one 's `` own '' ) for someone else 's boyfriend or girlfriend before the word itself . 
  edit : weird that i forgot * poisss\u00f5ber * ( `` boyfriend '' ) and * t\u00fcdruks\u00f5ber * ( `` girlfriend '' ) , which are used like in cheaply translated tv subtitles , but not that much in colloquial language because it 's considered an unnatural direct translation from english . 
  very few actually use it . 
  there are no such countries . 
  juhan , ( kalev ) , ilmar , anneli , kaarin/karin , annika , hanna are all common in estonia . 
  sexuality is irrelevant , almost nobody cares . 
  same goes for sex . 
  legislation about them however - conservative people get extremely touchy about that for some reason . 
  i mean , if you legalize same sex marriages , then all of us do need to marry people of the same sex . .

   but not swedish slavs ?

  and shakira law . 
   as if you did n't have any slavs   i 'm just trying to poke and find out whether you actually consider estonians slavs ...  not really , ** you 're one of the three baltic countries ** ( baltl\u00e4nder ) to us . 
  you were the one to deviate from linguistic/ethnic terms . 
  i ca n't believe you continue with this . 
  we were using linguistic/concepts and you came in saying estonia is baltic . 
  there is no question here how it came off . 
   by political/geographical terms . 
  sweden is also baltic ...  you are the only one speaking about linguistics . 
  it more or less is , at least it gives a wrong impression . 
  you were answering to a linguistic/ethnic comment , hinting that estonians are baltic . 
  well , sure that some were fighting solely for the purpose of keeping one 's country under their own rule and perhaps , just perhaps there is a reason to call some of the iraqis heroes because of that ( but not afghans because it was a legal war ) . 
  but if you are fighting for a totalitarian dictator , if you cooperate with religious radicals or if you target your own people in terrorist attacks , then you are really far from being a hero in my book . . 
  of course non-swimmers are common , i am one of them . 
  plenty of people like to swim outdoors in the summer ( basically two months max ) , but not that many go to public pools the rest of the year . 
  [ winter swimming ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/winter_swimming ) is quite popular though . 
  oh yes ... 
  estonians do share some cultural similarities with latvians , but it 's mostly with finns as we are a finnic people . 
  with lithuania we have relatively little in common culturally , far less than with scandinavians . 
  latvians however are baltic people like lithuanians , so they are culturally strongly related . 
   i 'm just trying to poke and find out whether you actually consider estonians slavs ...  not really , you 're one of the three baltic countries ( baltl\u00e4nder ) to us . 
  seriously ? 
  ah , a figure of speech perhaps then .

  that 's one thing of course . 
  but he seems to think estonians are baltic instead of finnic . . 
  nice lack of knowledge then . 
  as if you did n't have any slavs  i 'm just trying to poke and find out whether you actually consider estonians slavs ... 
   honestly if your city was voted ` best city to live in ' but it 's not on the sea , you can keep it all to yourself well that much is true , 
  but not swedish slavs ?

  i 'm not sure if there ever has been any serious interest in joining the nordic council , but there is a general agenda of `` differentiating from the other baltic states '' . 
  the euro and everything that was done to achieve it was a big part in this , for example . 
  as it stands , `` the baltics '' is a bit of a poor umbrella term . 
  estonia and lithuania share almost no common history in the longer term , even the religions are completely different , latvia is sort of inbetween . 
  but `` baltic '' does n't mean anything to us , we 're not balts nor even indo-europeans . 
  there are many countries around the baltic , nothing special really warrants lumping those three together nowadays , except lazy geography . 
  6/6 estonian meps voted against acta . 
  good . 
  if i got a gram for $ 16.40 i 'd be really happy ... : /, 
   the crisis is pretty much over , their debt increased a ton but they still borrow at dirt-cheap rates in their own currency . 
  yeah , but this is bullshit . 
  their debt is n't supposed to increase a ton and they 're not supposed to run a massive deficit for a decade straight . 
  the only reason they get off with this is thanks to the massive influence of the dollar . 
  the us is the worst posterboy for sustainability i could think of . 
  also , latvia * did * borrow extra money . 
  from the imf and from many of its neighbours . 
  nobody 's blaming the germans for orchestrating the bailouts or trying to consolidate fiscal responsibility , but people are upset over the troubled countries and their careless spending . 
  we followed the rules very closely to get the euro and generally believe that everyone else in europe should do the same ( someone even proposed not allowing a deficit to be written in the constitution ) . 
  some people have always been against the euro but the kroon was never anything more than a lydia koidula-clad cheaper version of the german mark or , later , the euro . 
  we had a currency peg and it was simply wasteful for businesses to convert it when trading or for people paying higher interest rates due to potential devaluation risks ( which is why most loans were taken in euros and not in kroons ) . 
  going back just does n't make sense . 
  we do complain because we have to bail out countries that all have a higher standard of living then us . 
  but that 's people writing comments online . 
  nobody is actually going to bother going outside for this . 
  and the political elite generally favours helping . 
  oh well , solidarity and whatnot . 
  if the eurozone wants to mutualise some of its debt , our 7 % public debt wo n't stand a chance . 
  so much for being a good financial citizen . 
  greece should start by dropping its minimum wage . 
  if its economy is n't any more productive than most of eastern europe , how is it sensible to have a minimum wage 2-3x higher than poland , czech republic , hungary or slovakia ? 
  it 's absurd and just makes it harder to employ people if they do n't actually produce this kind of wealth . 
  this title was very hard for me to say out loud quickly . 
  this post is so out of touch with reality that i 'm surprised anyone could upvote it at all . 
  the only sentence that could possibly be factually accurate is `` i 'm an estonian . '', 
  you can tell by the pessimistic doomsday whining . 
  i get my yearly allowance in these notes . 
  it 's rather unnerving to take them to the bank without feeling like my father is a mediterranean mobster . 
  when the sum exceeds $ 5000 , the bank starts asking questions , you have to fill out a form and get security clearance . 
  it still would have . 
  finland is very isolated genetically . 
  i 'm guessing 90 % of estonians ask themselves the same question whenever their country is shown in a positive light ( which happens quite often ) . 
  and i 'm quite sure every other country that used to be on this side of the iron curtain does the same . 
  you hear it all the time , `` what use are stable finances when everybody is leaving and the finns get paid ten times as much as we do ? '', 
  `` how can we be the least corrupt post-soviet nation if there 's so much corruption absolutely everywhere ? '', 
  `` why do we need the euro when the elderly are starving to death ? '', 
  this relentless and hyperbolic pessimism is very annoying . 
  most cee countries have developed insanely considering where they came from , they have integrated politically and economically . 
  hell , they have the chance to avoid many of the western mistakes along the way and could easily outperform some of the more tired economies after a catching up a bit more . 
  sex-ed in estonian schools , at least for the past 10 years , has been solid . 
  nothing is hidden from children and no topic is really taboo . 
  i guess it 's moreso caused by the partying-drinking culture and considerable sexual freedom . 
  if you check out [ this map ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d7/hiv_epidem.png ) , you can see some correlation in the extremities in europe . 
  besides contraception failing ( which happens rarely ) , in what case would n't it be the guy 's fault ? 
  his girlfriend convincing him it 's okay because she * wants to get an abortion ? 
  * edit : i would add that i never implied it was * only * the guy 's fault . 
  my initial post was a joke ( with a bit of bitter truth to it ) and mr_dickenballs put a little absolutist spin to it . 
  in any ( non-rape ) case , the man can always be blamed for not wearing a condom . 
  the woman as well , but the man is always at fault . 
  i can already picture how thousands of young estonian men have convinced their partners that having sex with a condom on is like taking a shower in a raincoat . 
  because there are no real alternatives . 
  but how would you feel if you were told your standard of living for the past decade has been undeservedly high and your nation should probably be not much wealthier than poland ? 
  shoddy build quality and whatnot , yes , but rwd and a cheap as peas price tag make ladas great home rally machines . 
  there are two simple explanations to the `` issues '' in this ridiculous article . 
  1 ) comparatively , in terms of how horrible they were , the german occupation paled in comparison to the russian one , mainly in estonia and latvia . 
  lithuania had considerable jewish populations , they might feel a bit different about them . 
  2 ) in estonia , any volunteers who joined the war joined it on the german side . 
  that 's because of the massive atrocities committed by the russians before the germans arrived in 1941 . 
  there were almost no volunteers for the red army , they had to be drafted forcefully . 
  these `` fascist '' celebrations only celebrate war veterans . 
  and because they could n't fight under the republic of estonia , they did it under the waffen ss . 
  they still had estonian flags on their coats and fought with the hope of being able to get their country back one day . 
  it 's perfectly normal to consider them heroes and celebrate them . 
  russian media loves to spin this to the highest order of bullshit though . 
  and some bleeding heart liberals in the west seem to eat it up , too . 
  this is all basically true . 
  but our strong it sector does n't really carry over that well into actual money making . 
  the biggest use is in public services . 
  there 's a massive citizen portal where you can use either your id card or your mobile phone ( if you have a special mobile id sim ) to access tons of public services . 
  this really is a massive convenience . 
  i 've submitted applications for prolonging the time before i get drafted , registering a permanent residence in a new home and transferring a car 's ownership rights to another person . 
  i did n't need to see my family doctor when i had an infection , she remotely prescribed antibiotics for me and i could pick them up at a pharmacy 500 meters from where i lived . 
  i can vote on all three major elections , do all my banking and taxes , apply for almost any university etc without ever leaving my home . 
  this is fantastic , but private sector it is n't all that special in estonia . 
  skype is the thing everyone 's heard about , but that 's pretty much it . 
  yes , there 's webmedia and playtech and many other quite large it firms , but it 's really not that different from your average computer-savvy european nation . 
  if we had a strong hardware sector to boost our capable software sector , things might be different . 
  but the software sector is getting better on its own , too . 
  computer science is probably the second most publicly funded field after medicine in estonian universities and it 'll soon be introduced to the standard high school curriculum as a voluntary subject . 
  they do have support on the country level , but i do n't think i exaggerate much when i say most of it is thanks to russian-speaking citizens . 
  out of 12 electoral districts in 2011 , ke won three and they all have large populations of ethnic russians . 
  they scored 40 % in lasnam\u00e4e / kesklinn/pirita and a whopping 54.4 % in east-viru . 
  it 's safe to say that if a solid alternative for russian voters should come along ( which it probably wo n't , considering the polarising shit-stirring that ke has been doing for the past 5 years ) , ke could face being the smallest fraction in the parliament . 
  and as semi-reasonable `` inter-opposition '' people are kicked out or leave to other parties , the crucial pensioner base is also falling apart - older voters will keep voting for the people they know and love , not for the next stooge ke puts on the ballot . 
  it 's interesting how news about tallinn in foreign media really fail to adequately reflect what 's actually going on . 
  the city of tallinn is run by a single party , keskerakond ( centre party ) . 
  this party used to be huge , but over the years it 's lost much of its popularity because of massive corruption , shady co-operation with united russia and completely insane political rhetoric . 
  they are in the parliament opposition and every party has ruled out co-operating them as long as their current leader ( edgar savisaar ) is still in charge . 
  so why does this party hold the all-important capital ? 
  it 's because their # 1 support group is russians , tallinn has lots of them and unlike parliament elections , local elections allow non-citizens to vote . 
  the fuhrer of the party , the mayor of tallinn , has lost all credibility among estonian voters and is trying to : a ) use as many idiotic money-wasting populist tricks as possible to keep his last seat until he finally dies of another heart attack or b ) make it really hard for anyone who might take his chair from him , because they would have to balance the budget , repeal this and many other stupid money wasters and somehow still remain popular .

  i will not lift a finger for people who suffer by their own hands . 
  islam is their problem . 
  it goes against everything that 's needed for modern society to function . 
  in fact i think islam is in direct opposition to western values and interests . 
  so if my enemies shoot themselves in the foot . 
  more power to them . . edit : that goes for finland too btw . 
  if the bear starts getting frisky . 
  do n't think you 'll remain untouched . . 
   in 10-20 years from now the eu will be operating on a wholly different level of what it should always have been . 
  you are delusional if you think the rest of europe will just lie down an take it like you . 
  if this goes on , in 10-20 years there will be no eu to speak of ... 
  that 's because you do n't know russians as well as we do . 
  they do n't care about estonia . 
  they care about sticking it to nato and for that , we are ideal . 
  so are you a 100 % sure ? 
  i need to be a 100 % sure , because when they come next time , estonia and estonians will be gone forever . . edit : and why would you buy from someone that constantly threatens , belittles , lies and generally talks shit about you ? 
  would you go to a shop that did that ? 
   i 've never said anything about the saudis financing terrorism . 
  but their little cozy plans of dominating the entire middle east and building thousands of mosques all around europe is not okay with me . 
  you let them build mosques ... 
   i see saudi arabia as a bigger threat than russia . 
  i know you have your historic reasons not to . 
  but i do n't think russia has any wish whatsoever to occupy eastern europe . 
  and as long as we have nukes , it will never be an option for russia . 
  look at the euro crisis , look at the refugee crisis ? 
  see any unity ? 
  people are not willing to protect their own borders and that 's with zero threat to their lives basically . 
  so you are saying these same people will suddenly grow a spine at the prospect of ww3 ? 
  unlikely . . only '' we '' here is the us ... they are war weary and sick and tired of europes bullshit . 
   isnt that no threat enemy sending refugees your way ? 
  a threat ? 
  are they in tanks ? 
  no that 's on we mostly . . so you know they do n't get their feels hurt . 
  apparently that 's more important than logic ... 
  let the man drink !, 
  it 's like watching a train wreck in slow motion ... 
  lol who makes these people ? 
  he literally goes around and calls everyone a nazi . 
  then praises his country for being social democratic and gloats for his country being '' number 1 '' apparently . 
  it 's easy to gloat when your exports look like this ... http://atlas.media.mit.edu/en/profile/country/nor/#exports or do you think your success is purely thanks to the virtues of social democracy ? 
   i am talking about other side of this problem . 
  attitude of public opinion . 
  there many westerners who welcome these people , help them and so . 
  east and central europeans do not show same will at all we were occupied by a foreign culture that tried to snuff our culture out . 
  that was just a few decades ago . 
  you think we forgot the lessons we learned so soon ? 
  and we were occupied by fairly civilized people , compared to whats coming in to europe now . 
  there will be no integration and these people will not pay for your pensions . 
  western-europeans are acting like sissies and no way are the migrants going to respect a culture like that . 
  hell ... even we do n't ... 
   i 'd rather import oil from russia than those lunatics from saudi arabia . 
  i would rather buy from the potential enemy that is far away and poses no threat , than the potential enemy nearby , that could be the mother of all threats . . 
  '' the danish railroad ca n't drive if there is ice on the trains or if it 's too sunny because that heats up the tracks so they expand . '', 
  if not , why is that ? 
  are your railroads built differently somehow ? 
  here trains run in every kind of imaginable weather . 
  accidents almost always include a drunk guy how ran into the train with his car . 
   i had a problem with my bmw recently well you can generalize a bit . 
  compare the build quality of a bmw ( or vw ) and a peugeot . 
  i think in general you can say that you are more likely to find shoddy work on a peugeot . 
  these stereotypes have to come from somewhere . . edit : if you said that in general a spaniard is more emotional than an estonian . 
  i would have to say that 's correct . 
  i was at a party full of spaniards in estonia once , and i must say , you do n't encounter that level of extroverted energy in estonia very often . . if ever . . 
  just my experience . 
  do n't read into it too much . 
  what bothered me most with that specific company was the attitude . 
  impossible to reach anyone . 
  it seemed like every time i called , someone was on vacation or had already left . 
  if i fuck up at work , i do n't care if my wife is having a baby , i 'm coming back to work ... 
  it was a nightmare dealing with these people . 
  so every time i did a design i just accounted for the 3mm . 
  we had a lot of work at the time , so sending it back to france for repairs was not really an option ( might have taken up to 6 months ) . 
  we did make our money back and then some , but needless to say it left a bad taste in my mouth . . 
  after years of experience , i can see if something is off by half a millimeter using nothing but my eyes . . so imagine my surprise . 
  here 's the kicker though , the machine lasted for about 5 years ( warranty was over ) . 
  want to repair it ? 
  20k $ :d ... 
   english is not the official language of the eu though , so it should not be a requirement . 
  helpful ? 
  yes . 
  but not a requirement . 
  english is the international language of business . 
  if you do n't speak it , you will look unprofessional . 
  eu law is not going to save your image . . 
   i do n't like when people are mocked because of their language skills or the lack thereof . 
  plus , as it was mentioned by another redditor , the interviewer herself speaks broken english . 
  if you want to do public work in a country like estonia , language skills are a must have . 
  small countries have to have good relations with their bigger neighbors . 
  that 's not really going to happen if you lack language skills . 
  ca n't speak foreign languages , step down and let someone more competent take your place . . 
  uhhh ... french work culture . 
  do n't get me started . 
  bought a 50k $ laser for marking on very small details from a french company . 
  had a 3mm inaccuracy right out of the box ( that 's a lot when you are marking 10mm details ) . 
  when i finally did reach them . 
  they said it was normal . 
  ca n't imagine that happening with germans . . 
  when it comes to food . 
  few measure up against the french , but precision is not your strong suit ... 
   right , so we 're going to import hundreds of millions of africans here because they already overpopulate .

  really ? 
   the only difference is that qatar or ksa are western allies . 
  the difference is that these two have always been cunts towards homosexuals , so no changes there . 
  in russia , however , the legal situation is worsening . 
  places where discrimination is high but stable vs a place where discrimination is discernibly rising . 
  russia does n't get to go whataboutist over this issue . 
  the likelihood is growing . 
  russia 's vague threats of ` consequences ' every time the topic comes up in finland do have a tendency of provoking finnish _ sisu _ . 
  you do know that that _ independent nation and ally _ had been randomly shelling georgian villages on both sides of border for weeks , right ? 
  the same villages they 've now ethnically cleansed ? 
  scotland is a nation . 
  southern ossetia is a fictional entity run by gru . 
   the us is the only partner actually meeting the obligations of the treaty ahem . 
   i 'd sacrifice these countries if it meant protecting the others . 
  which others ? 
  the next set of `` border countries '' russia will drool over ? 
  is handing over some countries every few decades to calm the beast a sensible strategy in the long run ? 
  here , you forgot those : '' '' '' '' '' '' . 
  that 's what you do living next to russia . 
  learn to kill tanks . 
  hell , even our ied training focuses on killing tanks . 
  wait , someone 's got _ tanks _ ? 
   including people who were born in estonia and had lived there all their lives born to illegal immigrants . 
  the republic 's ability to process new arrivals was , well , restricted . 
   had to go through an application process to get estonian citizenship it 's called [ naturalization ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/naturalization ) . 
  it 's a common enough procedure . 
   whereas ethnic estonians were granted citizenship of the new state automatically bullshit . 
  my grandmother is ethnic estonian and had to go through naturalization , as neither her parents nor her grandparents had been citizens pre-occupation . 
  _ it 's about citizenship , not fucking ethnicity _ . 
   the application process for citizenship involved a series of tests , including estonian language tests , which iirc were , at least at the outset , fairly rigorous . 
  there 's still a languague test when applying for citizenship . 
  if you 've lived here since you were born and have n't picked up the elementary-school level of proficiency required , whose fault is that ? 
  ah , right :  people have to remember that in soviet times , you could get by easily speaking just russian , especially in majority-russian areas , and speaking estonian was never required . 
  it 's been nearly a quarter of a century since ussr went \u043a\u0430\u043f\u0443\u0442 . 
  learn the lingo or fuck the fuck off . 
   it took 30,000 deaths of lithuanian forest brothers to scare russian population for decades not to come to lithuania , if such choice was available to them . 
  or , y' know , it was because the leaders of lithuanian ssr were able to convince moscow that the country was better utilized for agriculture . 
  the mining and heavy industry -- which were the main conduits for bringing in colonists -- were less dominant in lithuania than they were in latvia and estonia . 
  it 's not about them being russians - there are plenty of estonian nationals who are ethnic russians , and there are more russian citizens in that foreigner slice than there are those with no nationality whatsoever . 
  those belonging to that last group are free to apply for estonian citizenship , and their children are generally eligible from birth . 
  according to census data , the share of those w/o a nationality has dropped from 12.4 % in 2000 to 6.5 % in 2011 . 
  also , eko_one is bullshitting you . 
  all legal residents are eligible to vote in municipal elections , as is the case everywhere in eu afaik . 
   in the case of latvia and estonia , the proportion of non-eu foreign citizens is particularly large due to the high number of ` recognised non-citizens ' , mainly former soviet union citizens , who are permanently resident in these countries bu have not acquired latvian/estonian citizenship or any other citizenship . 
  slightly wrong there . 
  people with russian passports should make up a larger share of those numbers than those with no citizenship whatsoever . 
  estonian census in 2011 , for example , showed 89k russian citizens versus 84k undefined . 
  that 84k is 6.5 % of population , down from 12.4 % in 2000 . 
  ach , _ that 's _ integer division . 
  simple recursion . 
  my bad  progetiiger is a nice attempt to introduce the languague of programming ( as in , not _ a _ programming languague , but the fundamental grammar involved ) at an age that has shown to be very good at absorbing foreign languague-systems . 
  the sooner they start to apply those maths and languague skills on solving problems the better . 
  it 's simple , really . 
  when you have a pointless manufacturing sector , inefficient agriculture and antediluvian infrastructure you _ have _ to find a cost-effective way to get ahead . 
  it was a future we could afford . 
   what ?? 
  most five year olds ca n't even read and write , and have trouble understanding integer division . 
  you do n't need to understand integer division to learn the _ logic _ of programming -- how algorithms work , etc. 
  we need to get the next generation to be able to _ think _ like coders , even if they do n't become coders themselves . 
  or -- if they do n't write them symphonies , they have to understand how they work and how they 're made  besides , 5-year-olds are pretty much expected to be able to read nowadays . 
  @ilvestoomas your move . 
  capitalists and socialists neck and neck with 529 and 506 respectively .

  / r/europe giving life-long monogamous relationships the middle finger , again . 
   for they have a way of teaching languages in germany that is not our way , and the consequence is that when the german youth or maiden leaves the gymnasium or high school at fifteen , `` it '' ( as in germany one conveniently may say ) can understand and speak the tongue it has been learning . 
  in england we have a method that for obtaining the least possible result at the greatest possible expenditure of time and money is perhaps unequalled . 
  an english boy who has been through a good middle-class school in england can talk to a frenchman , slowly and with difficulty , about female gardeners and aunts ; conversation which , to a man possessed perhaps of neither , is liable to pall . 
  possibly , if he be a bright exception , he may be able to tell the time , or make a few guarded observations concerning the weather . 
  no doubt he could repeat a goodly number of irregular verbs by heart ; only , as a matter of fact , few foreigners care to listen to their own irregular verbs , recited by young englishmen . 
  [ . . ]  in the german school the method is somewhat different . 
  one hour every day is devoted to the same language . 
  the idea is not to give the lad time between each lesson to forget what he learned at the last ; the idea is for him to get on . 
  there is no comic foreigner provided for his amusement . 
  the desired language is taught by a german school-master who knows it inside and out as thoroughly as he knows his own . 
  maybe this system does not provide the german youth with that perfection of foreign accent for which the british tourist is in every land remarkable , but it has other advantages . 
  the boy does not call his master `` froggy , '' or `` sausage , '' nor prepare for the french or english hour any exhibition of homely wit whatever . 
  he just sits there , and for his own sake tries to learn that foreign tongue with as little trouble to everybody concerned as possible . 
  when he has left school he can talk , not about penknives and gardeners and aunts merely , but about european politics , history , shakespeare , or the musical glasses , according to the turn the conversation may take .

  nah , not necessarily a bad thing , but the ease with which projecting power into former colonies is undertaken is demonstrating a certain paternalistic thread still present in the state 's dna . 
   i was n't raised in a country that has a bad history with russia . 
  or , y' know , _ was occupied _ by russia at the time , 
  i 'd say french forces tend to show up in former colonies a tad too often , 
   soviet steamroller of yesteryear . 
  those days are long gone . 
  it 's not that they 're powerful , but that they 're unpredictable . 
  i 'd _ love _ to have a stable , modern russia on our eastern border , but what we have right now is n't as much a powder keg as it is a massive creaky container filled to brim with toxic porcine feces . 
  once it breaks , we 're in shit . 
   eu encroachment on its natural sphere fuck them and their natural sphere . 
  that 's the sick part of state nationalism as practiced in former empires -- they tend to see every bit of territory their cunt of a motherland had hold of in all of it 's history as their rightful possession . 
  brits have gone off it , germans and spaniards have gone off it , even the french are largely off it . 
  but the barbarians in russia -- egged on by the fucking state itself -- still consider themselves the rightful masters of large chunks of the world the populations of which want fuck all to do with them . 
  i apologize for the ` barbarians ' generalization in the paragraph above , as there are plenty of people in russia for whom civilization goes more than skin deep . 
  but they 're not in power , and have very little influence . 
  we 're already doing that . 
  it 's just tough to sort out those with actual educations from those who just bought a degree . 
  licence ? 
  it 's open source . 
  plus forex charges where applicable . 
  not when you subscribe to a screwed-up form of morality , no .

  the obvious answer is no , since not everyone votes for the people who form the government , who then goes to war , etc. 
  not to mention , that politicians lie . 
  this really is n't a question of who 's to blame , but of national and also personal interests . 
  i did n't support the iraq war , the libyan intervention , and i 'm not going to take the responsibility for them in the form of accepting the `` foreigners '' who are incompatible and do n't want to be compatible with my values . 
  `` they want putin-like leadership : just give me an authoritarian dictatorship and keep the foreigners out . '' i suspect he is more pissed about the `` foreigners '' than the whole `` authoritarian dictatorship '' bit . 
  because i can name a few authoritarian countries that mr. clinton is more or less fine about . 
  because the netherlands and scandinavia have a lot of migrants from countries with a much higher birth rate . 
  to be fair we have to compare the birth rates of ethnic swedes and dutch with the polish and italians . 
  and i would argue that poland and italy are not entirely religious countries , maybe in countryside , but today they are highly urbanized , so there is no substantial effect . 
  the whole level of religiousness is en masse not comparable to the 19th or first half of the 20th century levels . 
  that 's just plain denial . 
  i agree , even though i 'm not religious myself . 
  i think it 's possible , but tough to maintain healthy moral values without religion , when speaking of individuals , but it 's probably next to impossible on the scale of a whole society . 
  freedom is great , but abusable , since it 's sometimes easy to be irresponsible . 
  especially a type of freedom like in europe , where you still have a powerful welfare , good pensions etc. 
  this wo n't last long though , already crumbling and shrinking . 
  ... which represents about 1.3 % of the population . 
  and a lot of people agree with that , and this is exactly what is wrong with eurovision . 
  even though it 's not the show itself , it 's the people who vote based on their political preferences , not the actual song they like . 
  i feel that they tip the balance more than enough to make the show as shitty as it is . 
  `` you ca n't say the song was awful just because you think it is '' yes he can  that 's called having an opinion, 
  `` we would have a refugee relocation scheme which is fair to all member states '' even the small numbers of refugees who are destined to come to eastern europe , for example , are causing a rift . 
  we do n't need a relocation scheme , europe needs balls to sort out the refugees and the economic migrants , sending the latter back or to camps , until they go back to turkey or whatever themselves . 
  this is exactly why europe is divided , and what you are dreaming about in your post is basically a lack of opposition to brussels . 
  why should i answer any of your points when you ignore mine and just throw in some more ? 
  i will repeat one of my main points for you , which you and many others here simply ignore : `` we do n't want them , they 've proven themselves to be uncivilized just by the way they want to get here . 
  if you want them - fine . '', 
   we did n't bring them here . 
  you let them in . 
  people hate germany here because germany 1 . brings in those refugees 2 . then starts talking about distribution of refugees among other countries as well . 
  we do n't want them , they 've proven themselves to be uncivilized just by the way they want to get here . 
  if you want them - fine . 
  it 's some of the germans here on their high horses that are upset , how other countries do n't want to follow their example . 
  this is to typical of a response - some are rapists , some are murderes , and some are not rapists and murderers , but are from a culture that rejects most european values like equal rights , etc and will not give them up , and will teach their children to not give them up even when on european soil . 
  you are painting this liem they are in all aspects equal to us , and no they are not , the values of most of these people are certainly not the same as ours , hell , even europeans are different in this , but this is not even comparable to the differences between the european culture and some form of the islamic culture that refugees bring and that most are not going to give up . 
  we do n't have to bring them in at all , we are not obliged to give them access to our lifestyle , to our social systems , that our grandparents fought hard to build , we should build camps outside our countries , just like australia does with their detention centres , place them there , where they can survive and go back once this is over to rebuild their country . 
  this is both good and bad , it 's good because blocking the balkan route seems to be working at least in some way and bad because they might die on their way back to turkey . 
  but if this is what takes to halt the mass of refugees from turkey , by removing the incentives , sending a clear message that they will not be let in , then that is both in europe 's interests and at the same time will save the lives of those who would have wanted to attempt this journey , if the situation was the same as a year ago . 
  i had some respect for podemos , before i learned they want to bring more refugees into spain . 
  the same goes for varoufakis . 
  i have a feeling it will be syriza all over again , no real promised change in the economy , just more insane stuff like bringing more refugees . 
  `` lawmakers from the spanish left wing party podemos led by pablo iglesias , are staging a week-long hunger strike to rally public support for refugees '' https://www.yahoo.com/news/podemos-lawmakers-hunger-strike-spain-favour-refugees-150947955.html, 
  then any opposing campaign should be permitted , no matter how offensive , period . 
  + radicals , who wish this was implemented in their country , like syrian islamists . 
  this does n't have a lot to do with islam the religion , this is about a group of people , who identify with islam , using it as a unifying doctrine . 
  this is a classic `` us vs they '' attitude . 
  this is why these people should not be allowed to come to europe . 
  `` it 's not like there 's normal debate with logical reasoning here . '', 
  there 's been lots of that here , you just to chose to ignore it apparently , because you have no logical arguments on your own , only arguments in this style : `` i ca n't believe you 're so inhumane ! '', 
  `` if you were a refugee you 'd do the same '' etc. 
  i do n't know 100 % about these terrorists , but as practice shows the schools where most of the children are of immigrant non-eu background are ineffective at teaching western european values . 
  these values certainly clash with whatever they are being said at home , and guess who 's words are more powerful and influential , some teacher 's or their family , their relatives , their friends ? 
  they were born in europe , yes , but they lived in self-formed ghettos almost their entire life , which is a whole lot different than just living in europe , because the whole migrant community there is different as well . 
  this can be abused by smugglers and people willing to use smugglers , thus vessels can be saved , but people must be brought back to wherever they came from . 
  if they do n't say where they came from , or no country accepts them - take them to a camp with minimum things needed for survival . 
  at least that will heavily reduce the incentive to come here via smugglers or any other way in the first place . 
  i do n't see any good solution here , and just letting them in is no solution at all . 
  i thought the idea was to stop people from coming , not leaving . 
  quoting the express : `` in his manifesto , he proposed to reform the bloc then holding a referendum to give french voters the choice to accept the reformed terms of the eu membership of to leave the union . '', 
  thats where i got the referendum part , i don\u00e4t speak french , sadly to use other sources fully . 
  i guess you might know more about thsi , but melenchon if he even wins would not have a lot of time for all of this . 
  i only know he wants a referendum that seems pretty similar to what the uk had . 
  and cameron never said `` we want out '' . 
  and if melenchon want a referendum he basically wants that `` we want out '' option for his own people then . 
   it 'll probably have to rethink some of its current principles , which would probably be for the best . 
  i chuckled very hard on this one , i 'm sorry , but even brexit had no positive effect , and it seems to have pushed for an eu army even more and more integration as well . 
  unless you consider that positive , then melenchon is supposedly against all that . 
  still not enough for a proper melenchon surge , unless that one article on the net was right and he has , like le pen , the most devoted supporters , who will go and vote , while macron 's will stay home . 
  then realistically france could have a melenchon-le pen showoff , wow . 
  i 'm starting to think that for the eu this might be a more decisive moment that brexit . 
  germany is the richest and only has approx 1 % spending , so it will cost them a lot and give the nato more arms to no cost for the us , but if i assume the usa is consistent in that they will demand the same from spain and italy , good luck with that . 
  yeah , i read that in one article , which stated that le pen 's voters are of the most devoted ones ... 
  but i guess the question here is whether melenchon can actually make it to 2nd place in the first round and how is he going to get those missing votes ? 
  i assume there will be no more debates till april 23 , not sure whether he can get the needed votes through his rallies . 
  that 's why you should elect him for another 5 years after that , lol !, 
  actually , it seems france is definitely in the turbulence zone now , after being ruled by only two president mitterand and chirac for 26 years . 
  neither sarkozy nor hollande has been able to get a second term ... 
  are we ? 
  macron is more or less strong in the polls , maybe sliding down to 23 % a bit lately . 
  why are you confused ? 
  who do you think they should support then ? 
  the corrupt centre-right that usually fulfull only those promises that benefit them the super-rich directly ? 
  same for the centre-left , who more often than not embrace neoliberal policies of the centre-right . 
  it 's pretty clear that france and many other countries need to `` refresh '' their political elite , which must then help with social mobility with appropriate laws , whether they be left or right is another question . 
  the populists are a problem , but only because the non-populists are stagnant careerists . 
  `` we have seen , though , with the brexit referendum and the election of donald trump , that people vote for those who recognize their problems , whether or not the solutions they propose will work . '', 
  which makes you think if the ones that should have recognized the problems - the so called centre-rights and centre-lefts - are actually against the trumps and brexits . 
  if they are , why are they pursuing the same old strategy ? 
  if they are not , are they politically stupid and ready to hand over their seats and positions to others ? 
  or it reminds me of one article which stated hillary clinton and her elite is not actually afraid or that much against of trump , because she and the super rich will be just fine under him ( which is true , trump calmly dropped the whole `` lock her in '' thing ) , but who she is afraid are politicians like sanders , who might just shift the situation at least in some way , but you know who 's going to pay for it !, 
  and 9-13 % just said denmark ( dk ) !, 
  :d for no reason . 
  i like to believe that . 
  the text is very small , hard to read , more context please ? 
  official syria is not a state with a legitimate government , by the us definition . 
  in reality it 's not really a state anymore , just a territory with different factions . 
  but that does n't mean everything is permitted now , at least in terms of ethics . 
  somehow lacks detail this , are there no exact reasons state why she does n't have enough connection to denmark to stay ? 
  it feels like both parties have become complacent , the fact that hamon was chosen as a candidate felt like a shift , but too little too late and because it 's crystal clear they ca n't win the ordinary way . 
  provided that macron and le pen get to the second round that is .

  but you can not claim they want new-russia . 
   the only resolution can be discussions with the rebels about their greivances . 
  do they want more autonomy ? 
  disagree . 
  rebels should put the weapons down or die . 
  and only after that should be referendum or whatnot . 
  because you assume that rebels represent people right now . 
   it 's obviously difficult to tell in a proxy war how greatly one side is supported is it really ? 
  only few months ago crimea was annexed , already we see west as equally involved ? 
  does it make sense ? 
  if i see western tanks grabbing chunks of ukraine i will start agreeing with you maybe . 
   but i know the ukrainian response has n't been exactly popular in the areas concerned . 
  ukraine 's non-response was even less popular . 
  ukraine was holding back any violent action for very long time . 
   if there are people who have a problem with being a part of the ukraine , then there should be discussions over the future of the relevant areas . 
  yes , the problem ( for russia ) is that they are in minority right now . 
  how do you change that ? 
  prolong the conflict . 
  make kiev fuck up more and more , which is inevitable in war . 
  actually there was a study ( sorry too lazy to look for it ) that happiest people are somewhere in the middle or upper middle class , not the rich . 
  so yeah , be careful , 
   if russia was arming the rebels they wouldnt send in 3 broken down tanks from the 60 's . 
  they would send in an entire division of modern tanks . 
  i 'd say quite the opposite . 
  this is exactly what they 'd do . 
  this is the style they are involved in ukraine from the beginning ( crimea ) . 
  polls in ukraine and in russia ( if not mistaken ) suggest russian invasion is unwanted . 
  russia needs to prolong and destabilize the situation further , its the only way they are able to sway the opinions . 
  yes . 
  lets equal the both sides even tho russia annexed part of ukraine few months ago . 
  now that russia wants another chunk of ukraine and west tries to prevent that from happening , west is still somehow equally bad . 
   but even if your economy was shit , it was your shitty economy , not the soviet union 's . 
  here , let me break it down for you . 
  finland has/had capitalism , soviet union had communism . 
  estonia was part of soviet union . 
  estonia did not have a choice whether to have capitalism or communism . 
  communism was imposed . 
   not really , soviet economy grew strong and was healthy until the late 70s decline . 
  yeah , it failed , thats what everyone is saying here . 
   soviet sphere of influence also had positives first of all ? 
  estonia was part of su ( occupied ) , not `` sphere of influence '' . 
  you think russians just came in and started building schools ? 
  first they eliminated the `` unwanted '' , pretty similar to what nazis did . 
  people were sent to deathcamps to siberia in cattle cars . 
  after this ideological cleansing they built the schools ( and lets be clear here , pretty shitty schools . 
  estonia was western country on par with finland . 
  soviet union never achieved standards west had ) . 
  anyway , the whole point being it can be pretty offensive to say soviets had positive things too . 
  would you say to a jewish person nazis had positive things too , stop shaming germany ? 
  this, 
  i agree with both of you actually . 
  i think nato should focus with more troops and training on eastern eu and invite finland if they are interested , and just ignore russias rhetorics and trainings . 
  as i believe we should buckle up for cold war 2 . 
  we should get used to lots of trainings and empty gestures on the borders for next couple of decades ... my bet its going to be just like last time where west is not interested in fighting russia and russia has no resources to fight nato . 
  actually did n't go so bad for the west . 
   who is testing boundaries here ? 
  i love how people already forgot crimea . 
  same way as eu ( nor us ) had no power regarding crimea and ukraine , situation is similar regarding nato from russia point of view . 
  i think finland could easily join , russia would just threaten * n * times and thats about it . 
  wow , it seems there is some `` stupid comparison '' virus going on . 
  how is 1990s end of soviet union similar to annexation of crimea ? 
  close , estonian . 
  i 'm criticizing his stupid comparison . 
  hate ? 
  over few lines ? 
  i have no such emotional capabilities . 
  i 'm so dead inside that i have room maybe for only one person to hate . 
   this is why everyone wants to be in the nato nad have good relations with the west instead of being closer to russia . 
  on top of that someone invented notion of `` russophobe '' so it can be applied to russias neighbors who take the western path and rather stay away from their `` sphere of influence '' . 
  and this ...  anti-semitism started world war ii . 
  russofobien can start a third . 
  this guy has diarrhea between his brain wrinkles . . comparing modern finland with nazi germany , and in that context russians with jews . 
  the struggle to somehow turn everyone into a fascist reveals some serious mental health issues russias society is going through right now . 
  rotating nato troops would make most sense . 
  these examples not so good actually , napolean and columbus are pretty far history . 
  i think calling some russian town based on peter the great would n't have controversy . 
  better example would be if some eastern european country would name one of their towns a hitlergrad for instance . 
  i 'm curious how philosophical russians would be about it . 
  edit : i should add that i agree with azog , that it is up to them to decide what to name their city . 
  but we can criticize them as freely . 
  plus there was speculations that black sea has loots of oil under . 
  maybe they knew something that we dont . 
  so it might come out veeery profitable . 
  uuh , cool thanks , i have a good visual memory i suppose , i saw that video once like a month ago or something ( when it was released ) . 
  i think eastern europe is realizing that it has more support from us than eu at this point ( which is idiotic in itself ) . 
  so if western eu is quite critical of us lately , eastern eu sees us more of an ally and is much more forgiving ( nsa ) . 
   c ) death to all russians !, 
  man you are suffering severe self-aggrandisement . 
  nobody cares about your nationality or ethnicity , there are few imperialists who should go to hell though . 
  the nose is very similar . 
  the ear definitely different . 
  but i remember the video without the mustache being on the other side - so it might be flipped image ( other ear ) ? 
   actually , if they want to live in jail it becomes a shelter . 
  wait . 
  this is how you see it or you are trolling ? 
  if you go to jail , you can call it a shelter as much as you want , other people will still say you went to jail . 
  you can change your personal use of words as much as you want , this - * a place for the confinement of people accused or convicted of a crime . 
  penal institution , place of detention , lock-up , place of confinement , guardhouse , correctional facility , detention centre * - is still a jail . 
  first of all . 
  what does he think he can achieve with this ?

   on the other hand , putin with his propaganda is capable of convincing a lot of russians that standing their ground is worth it even at the cost of an economic downturn . 
  we 'll see how long that party lasts , there might be pretty bad hangover after a year or two . 
   but i think main the issue here is that turkey is muslim , georgia - christian . 
  agree , this is a crucial difference ( at least in the heads of eu `` bosses '' ), 
   i think your government has a clear influence by fascist parties ok , but is n't every government in that sense . 
  look at tea party in us . 
  or that popular white haired dude in holland . 
  or dugin in russia ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/aleksandr_dugin talking about the flags , check out the flag of national bolshevism ) . 
  i mean . 
  i totally agree that far-right is deplorable . 
  but my claim is that its everywhere to a degree . 
  and i have n't seen any evidence its somehow more prevalent in ukraine . 
  would you consider svoboda a fascist ? 
  ( you say they have seats in gov. ), 
   if you want to say that the government in kiev is n't ruled by fascists , fine . 
  no , i do n't want to say that . 
  i actually and quite honestly want to understand , what 's behind the accusation of kiev being run by fascists . 
  for instance , how many of the right sector guys are in the government and what places are they in . 
  just want to get some perspective on this . 
   most countries have some right elements , very few have actual right-wing thugs . 
  i mean , look at them . 
  hmm . 
  are these guys in the gov. ? 
  or are they just some random guys ? 
  because i 've seen louis theroux on similar thug type `` activists '' in america . 
  i 've seen documentary about exactly similar guys in moscow ( where they beat up immigrants and train themselves in some dodgy construction sites ) . 
  there was just some neo-nazi rally in sweden and i think in germany . 
  i will add a specification in my initial question about the kiev . 
  because i have an impression that russia blames ukraine of being run by ultra-nationalists . 
  i actually wanted to make a thread here in / europe about one thing that is pointed out in this article . 
  maybe some pro-russians in ukraine can explain it here . 
   nobody i 've met at pro-russia rallies has described any real threats or instances of repression . 
  asked what 's motivating them , they invariably turn to stock phrases that have been widely propagated on russian state television : `` kiev junta , '' `` fascists , '' `` illegitimate government , '' `` referendum , '' `` federalization . '' follow-up questions rarely yield any enlightening answers . 
  so the question is . 
  is kiev run by fascists , like so many pro-russians in reddit and in russian media claim ? 
  in what way fascism is manifesting itself in ukraine ( is it on paper or the actions ) ? 
  * my own understanding so far : because i have n't yet seen any fascist political decisions coming from kiev ( perhaps western media has been omitting the issue ) . 
  here in reddit i heard few times about making russian language illegal , but it sounds ridiculous and unrealistic . 
  i know there are few right sector guys on top places . 
  but is n't it universal ? 
  is n't `` ultra-nationalists '' represented pretty much in every country 's government ( including russia - dugin , zhirinovsky ) ? 
  * edit : specified my question, 
   russians have n't been interested in that since the complete rape of their country in the 90s . 
  yeah , thats called fall of an empire that was held together with tanks and oppression . 
  what did russia expect , a handout on silver platter and a soft cushion ? 
  the problem with russia is that its sh ` tting in its own bath and its comfortable in it . 
  instead of changing the water it keeps living in the same old sh ` t. 
  world is changing and moving forward while russia keeps looking back at fairy tales of the past . 
   they 've been perpetually dicked around by the us since the 90s , just an example would be the fact that they were promised no nato bases east of germany in exchange for allowing it 's unification and entry into nato and now their entire border is filled with them . 
  that 's because eastern europe was very eager to join nato ( tanks to soviet union ) . 
  they are a sovereign countries after all . 
  and by the way . 
  promises that are not on the paper are not very good for argument my friend . 
   this whole situation came about because the of the eu ultimatum which forced ukraine , the south-eastern part of which is vital to russia 's security ukraine is ukraine , not russia . 
  and eu has been very friendly towards russia since the 90 's . 
  even now you can see how they want to please russia . 
  it 's just eu has very different understanding of 21st century . 
  it is not thinking of terms of `` whoa , we need a buffer , because we are potentially going to war with russia '' . 
  eu has no issues with countries like switzerland and norway etc ( including russia ) being next to them . 
  because eu is bunch of pacifist who wants business relations with its neighbors . 
  but russia seems to live in the past , play the good old iron curtain game . 
  looking back , i can tell that both misinterpreted each other . 
  russia did not understand eu , that it just wanted to be business partners , and eu did not understand russia , that its still in cold war mode . 
  edit : looking for a way to hide bad words , 
  on the other hand what you expect ? 
  the need to get rid of russia 's gas dependency has never been greater . 
  in the sense this government is f * cked anyway , if they make pro-ukrainian decisions they are going to be hated by pro-russians and vice versa . 
  and if they do nothing they are going to be hated by both sides . 
  it 's just bit too convenient to call every pro-ukrainian a right sector . 
  edit : are all pro-russians communists ? 
  link to russian site , nice work . 
  definitely true then . 
  especially story about `` right sector '' . 
  they seem to be everywhere . 
   no western country requires those born within to pass a citizenship test . 
  what are you talking about ? 
  probably no-one will leave and no-one will show up . 
  kiev has no authority , but i 'm pretty sure this dude does n't have any either . 
  ukraine needs elections real fast . 
  maybe even too late for that . 
  yes , thank you !, 
  read between the lines - probably the opposite . 
  but on the other hand . 
  i would n't be surprised if they lose control at some point quite entirely , if actual civil war erupts . 
  edit : lose , not loose . 
   when is estonia - an eu country - going to address rampant racism and apartheid practices that actively discriminate against `` ethnic russians '' who have been living in estonia longer than it has been a recognised independent state ? 
  the parents ** chose ** not to get the citizenship . 
  and they also ** chose ** not to get it to their children . 
  who are you to dictate what they should do for themselves and for their kids ? 
  right , i forgot , putin makes all the decisions in the land of perfect . 
   i can link to stuff showing russias gdp skyrocketing like crazy but your insane mind will just ignore it and scream again louder that their economy is crumbling . 
  russias economy has been slowing down since 2008 . 
  and was predicted to go down even further . 
  but ok , if you say russia is doing amazing good for them . 
  / s  or you will scream putin is a dictator when he got currently 80 % + approval rating . 
  hitler had high approval ratings too . 
  this is not how definition of dictator works . 
  putin controls the media , suppresses the opposition and silences the critics . 
   another insane brain rattle , you dont seem to even know what nazi mean russia invading sovereign countries based on nationalistic arguments , smells like nazi to me . 
   i am sure you were deepest fan of russia before crimea happened i was n't worried .

  if you pretend to care about life quality , then at least be consistent in that . 
  well , we 're not doing much better actually . 
  our foreign trade has stagnated for 4-5 years and investment is lagging aswell . 
  we 're quite dependant on finland in many aspects . 
  anyway , finland is still a huge idol for estonia , if one can say that . 
  not only because of linguistic relations and proximity , but how a relatively young country with no huge resources has managed to become one of world 's most developed and stable one . 
  meh , your economy might be struggling right now but the society is still level-headed and extremely stable . 
  growth will return soon . 
  telia eesti ( part of teliasonera ) made a new mobile internet offer which removes roaming fees for nordic & baltic countries ( basically the countries where they operate ) and when journalists asked from elisa eesti about doing the same for finland & estonia ( that 's where they operate ) , they said `` our customers do n't want it '' . 
  sure , i mean those tens of thousands of estonians working in finland sure want to pay roaming fees or pay bills for both estonian and finnish services at once . 
  their attitude does n't seem too favourable towards customers and i surely do n't feel for them when eu forces price caps for them . 
  and i fekkin ' use that provider . 
  might think about changing . 
  definitely not . 
  i mean , it seems that czech republic is trying to keep koruna cheap , so czech export is competitive , while we can do that only as the whole eurozone bloc together . 
  but estonian kroon , since its readoption in 1992 , was always pegged to deutschmark and the euro and not once was it devalued by even 1 % , so adopting the euro changed nothing regarding that . 
  the only thing that did affect prices was just rounding , but that was completely marginal . 
  one could argue that some things even got cheaper as it was harder to rip off customers with exchange rate ( prices could be compared directly now ) . 
  especially for cz . 
  prague is now cheaper than tallinn . 
  so energy union is basically dead and instead let 's make us even more dependant on russia . 
  how great that one country 's short-term business interests are put above those of the union . 
  i 've noticed that . 
  meanwhile , i do n't remember such surnames being used in estonia . 
  i do n't have the impression that russian tourists here would be more annoying than others . 
  i mean , most come probably from st. petersburg and they seem to be okay . 
  i guess those that see us as nazi-glorifying russophobic fascists wo n't even come . 
  also , it 's difficult to always know whether russians are tourists or locals . 
  it 's one of the very few times i have to agree with / u/rizzzeh . 
  big part of the post-soviet world is still , in many ways , attached to the collapsed union . 
  lots of people from poorer regions work in moscow , for example , and send money home . 
  many countries have not recovered from collapse of the union and have failed to build up successful societies . 
  ties with russia are strong . 
  baltics are quite exceptional in completely ` changing ' ( recovering ) their alignment to the west and breaking nearly all ties with ussr . 
  do n't worry , it 's balkans , they can handle anything . 
  they should become part of bosnia and herzegovina as another constituent entity , and to make the clusterfuck even worse , macedonian albanians should get their own autonomous part like republika srpska in bosnia . 
  fyi , openness and tolerance do not equal favouring mass immigration . 
  possibly , but it 's not as inconvenient for baltics as it is for ukraine and belarus , because for geographic reasons , russia is pretty much the only direction for the railways here , except for a small pl-lt connection . 
  the currently planned rail baltic , high-speed railway connecting tallinn to warsaw , would be european gauge , though . 
  how ironic that russian railways is dealing with serbia where the rails are european gauge , while baltics with their russian gauge are now completely dominated by western companies . 
  but i 'd say [ eu ] ( http://f.pmo.ee/o/2015/05/20/4088961t1h203e.jpg ) ( estonia ) offers better than [ russia ] ( http://i2.wp.com/inserbia.info/today/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/serbian_railways_class_7111-650x484.jpg?resize=650%2c484 ) ( serbia ) . 
  red . 
  these are all names for colours in estonian - finnish : red , blue , yellow and green . 
   so drunk that they forget a bunch of letters from the ends of words . 
  it 's actually you who put pointless additional letters to each word , making them uselessly long . 
  i mean , by the time you finish saying * ensimm\u00e4inen * , estonians have already become * esimene * twice . 
  forgot the word for green and made up a new random one ? 
  estonia-russia border in narva is basically a clash point of different cultures with a river dividing them , that formed in centuries , while estonia-latvia border only appeared in about 1920 and was drawn rather artificially as estonia and latvia had been one country for a long time and the newly born countries could n't really agree on a just border ( estonia and latvia nearly went to a war because of that , a brit was called to solve the issue ) . 
  that 's why the first one looks fancy and symbolic while the latter is just some random border infrastructure that 's mostly not in use anymore . 
  even above it by [ now ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/ireland/gdp-constant-prices ) and growing further . 
  0.35 $ a litre in estonia right now . 
  i feel bad for paying so little . 
  there are many non-white people in tallinn and tartu , working or studying , almost none outside of those . 
  there are no major issues with them , but the refugee crisis sure seems to have increased racism among some locals , which is incredibly shameful . 
  but then again , you would n't want to communicate with such people anyway . 
  our shitty performance is mostly due to lagging foreign trade and well , for finland , that 's actually one of their best growth numbers in years , so maybe they are climbing out of the crisis and our trade also improves . 
  one can hope ... 
  with greece 's unemployment of ~ 25 % , it 's absolutely clear they do not need any more people there to live on tax money , especially not random people of foreign background . 
  if anything , greece might want to send some of their people to work abroad until economy recovers to a point they can actually offer them a job again . 
  how much longer until sweden bans collecting any kind of information based on ethnic/linguistic/national grounds , including statistics on employment , education , incomes etc , so we will never have any bad statistics about integration and as a result , there will obviously be no problems with immigration or integration whatsoever in fairy tale land of sverige ? 
  because it sure seems to be going that way . 
  wars and plagues , to put is shortly . 
  estonia 's population in the beginning of 18th century is estimated to have been roughly same as in 13th century , about 160 ' 000 , so 5 centuries of wars , famines and plagues nullified any growth . 
  then it grew rapidly to around 1 ' 000 ' 000 until wwi , when russia turned red and estonia broke off . 
  a rather slow increase since then and then as we all know wwii , occupations , mass escape to the west , deportations . 
  the number of estonians peaked in 1930s and has since never fully recovered to those levels , but population still grew due to soviet migration and when that thing collapsed , a lot of these migrants returned , pushing population into decrease again . 
  and then we have today 's society where europeans do n't make enough babies and we 're also not wealthy enough to be a popular immigration destination , so ... yeah . 
  hopefully all czechs are away drinking beer or something , so they wo n't open this map . 
  meh , the 3 lions were always on estonian kroon coins and danish krone has different design ( + they 're not using the euro ) . 
  would n't have been a problem . 
  how come you ca n't recognize our glorious map ? 
  ah , let 's be honest , it 's one of the most meaningless and boring designs . 
  but at least you can see where our only hilly regions are . 
  if you lived here , you would n't think it 's paranoia . 
  i mean , the reasons stretch from not only history to russia 's recent invasions , but also from the extremely hostile attitude of moscow ( an example would be russia imposing a partial trade block on estonia just for relocating a soviet monument in 2007 , another one that russia refuses to return estonian president 's [ medal ] ( http://g1.nh.ee/images/pix/file18261855_teenetemark1_375.jpg ) it stole during the occupation in 1940 , of course it refuses to even call that occupation ) to the russian minority here , a lot of whom are mentally similar to those in eastern ukraine ( just take a walk in estonia 's easternmost town narva and you 'll find the same symbols of russian chauvinism - st. george 's ribbons , flags of russia on people 's cars etc ) . 
  on 9th may , you could actually think these areas are 100 % in russian federation etc. 
  the 2 main reasons why there 's no donbass going on here are better life quality than russia and nato . 
   unfortunately my country is run by spinless worms who 'd gladly delegate all their foreign and defensive political duties to eu/nato . 
  then why have n't they done so ? 
  why do we still have conscription ? 
  why are we one of the very few ones to spend the nato-required 2 % of gdp on defence ? 
   my high school morning show shown only to a few thousand students had a better intro than estonia yeah , they 've staid with this one for a long time already , since at least 2009 or even earlier . 
  when they 'll ever get time to make a new one , hopefully they 'll take finland as an example . 
  would n't want some epic action graphics flashing there 3 times a day . 
  not a singe `` journalists '' name has been published in the site . 
  they 're probably afraid that none of them would ever get a job in baltics media enterprises after working for putin 's propaganda factory . 
  obviously you have n't been to / r/russia . 
  indeed . 
  estonia 's business paper \u00c4rip\u00e4ev is the one that lists richest people every year and last year , kristo k\u00e4\u00e4rmann , founder of transferwise , a successful start-up company , took the first place . 
  which i personally think is fantastic , because we finally have people there that actually earned their money , not some weird guys in some shady 90s russian transit business or similar . 
   would you be imprisoned ? 
  certainly not . 
  i just do n't have the motive , nor is there evidence from my past pointing i would actually support it . 
   would you be put on a some kind of secret watch list ? 
  we never know that . 
   would you be racially profiled ? 
  it 's quite difficult to do that here considering one can hardly visually decide whether one 's estonian or russian and even the surnames might be misleading ( estonians might have russian names and russians might have estonian names ) . 
  however , considering that statistically russians are over-represented in crime , there might be some ( unnoticed ) discrimination but that 's certainly not considered acceptable . 
   europe is so different from the usa ... 
  true that , but europe consists of many different countries .

  do n't hate nazism , hate germany !, 
  [ coincidentally ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tal_der_ahnungslosen ) ? 
  it 's far simpler than that . 
  they have to apply to get citizenship . 
  if they do n't apply , they wo n't get citizenship ( which has many upsides ) . 
  if they apply , but do n't know the language , they also do n't get citizenship . 
  russia is the sole legal successor of the ussr . 
  ussr imported them here , it should be russia to grant them automatic citizenship . . 
  because russians were sent to these countries illegally under an illegal foreign occupation to russify the countries and create an eternal fifth column . 
  we went the road as to nullify the illegal occupation and therefore russian has no place in our countries as an official language . 
  not in latvia . . 
  well that 's unexpected ... 
  ever driven on latvian roads ? 
  if we 'd built a nuclear plant , we would probably rise on the list as it 's still better than oil shale . 
  why does this one bother you , but the other official names do n't ? 
  looking at the current weather , we 'll also have no snow in a week ... 
  i would n't say `` not in a million years '' , but realistically , not in 20 years at least . 
  did it ? 
  did it really ? 
  hitler was part of a right-wing government , where he had quite a big role . 
  it 's a bit different than a wide government including a populist party . 
  classical political theory for you . 
  if you want to marginalize radicals : include them in a mainstream ideology government !, 
  yet as history has shown , any try for such `` solution '' has caused in a million more problems . 
   so what truly can we do to solve this situation ? 
  there is only one answer . 
  punch him in the face every time he reaches for your wallet !, 
  if you look at the amount of people , who 'd favor appeasement with putin , then it becomes quite worrying . 
  it 's as if they remember nothing from the prelude of world war ii . 
   is it likely for russia to really want to invade estonia ? 
  there are a key aspects that most westerners disregard when talking about a possible russian invasion of these countries . 
  russia is inherently an imperialistic dictatorship . 
  many still have views that these territories rightfully belong to russia . 
  plus a swift victory in foreign affairs is usually what dictators like these do to get internal attention away from internal affairs like the failing economy . 
  so the typical argument `` why would russia attack , there is nothing to gain '' stems from a stance that lacks this knowledge about russia . 
   i could only imagine having my tiny appartment in tallinn , then see my neighbours deported to a gulag and replaced by occupiers ( plus using nightgowns for ... interesting purposes ) . 
  well let 's take my grandfather 's family as an example . 
  - in 1944 his father was deported because he was in the auxiliary police during the nazi occupation , despite his unit having no role in the holocaust whatsoever . 
  he died in kolyma near magadan in 1952 , 2 years before release . 
  cause of death : lung cancer , just like for anyone , who worked a few months in a gold mine in kolyma . 
  - in 1949 when he was 8 years old , he and his 11 year old sister were arrested and taken to the railway station . 
  their mother quickly found them and was also arrested in the train station . 
  her mother was arrested as well . 
  they were all sent to siberia to live in former army barracks . 
  they returned in 1954-1956 when released , but the mother had to work 6 months to earn enough money to buy a train ticket back to estonia . 
  when they returned , their two houses had been confiscated and my grandfather and his sister only got them back after the restoration of independence . 
  - in the same 1949 my great-grandfather arrived to that train station later from another town and asked to be deported together with his wife , daughter and two grandchildren , but was denied as `` the quotas '' had already been filled . 
  or my grandmother 's family : - in 1944 the soviets bombed tallinn , which according to their logic was their own town . 
  they hit the neighboring building of my grandmother and her family only got out with all its members before their house burned down . 
  - in 1945 her father was arrested and sent to a russian prison for 8 years as he was in the institution giving out apartments left over in estonia . 
  reason of deportation : too many apartments given to ethnic estonians . 
  or my other grandfather 's family : - in 1941 they were to be deported , but his father offered vodka for the soviet officials and they went on and deported another family . 
  - in 1944 my grandfather lied himself to be one year younger to avoid soviet mobilization . 
  - in 1945 a new border was drawn and their land was left on the russian sfsr side . 
  their farm was confiscated and they all had to live in separate places all over estonia as they had no other choice . 
  or my other grandmother 's family : - in 1944 they tried to escape to the west , but missed the last ships . 
  - in 1949 they heard about the deportation happening soon and hid in forests for three weeks until `` the quotas had been filled '' . 
  so if you consider all this and that almost every estonian has stories like these in their family , you should not be surprised about our negative sentiment towards russians , especially considering that some if not many deny that these events happened or deny the illegality and the criminality of these events , let alone that many of them glorify these criminals . 
   in your view , do you think russian populations still influence estonia a lot ? 
  quite a lot , they vote for the centre party mostly , but it had a pro-western leadership change and until the next elections they will be a strong center-left pro-western party , but only time will tell if russians will keep voting for them . 
  - you deport 1 % of the estonian population to siberia . 
  8 % of the country escapes abroad out of fear , if the others resist , you deport another 2 % to siberia . 
  - you send russians to work in occupied estonia and install them into the former homes of estonian families - you build new towns and ugly apartment bloc districts and bring in more russians to work - eventually you will have one russian for every two estonians . 
  if they would have given it one more decade , there would have been more russians than estonians , like it already barely happened in latvia with latvians . 
  it was n't the first russification period in estonia , the first one was already in about [ 1885-1905 ] ( http://www.estonica.org/en/history/1850-1914_national_awakening/russification_period/ ) . 
  if you are interested in that subject , then there is [ a very good documentary ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dg0c3skovw&amp;t=1s ) about the singing revolution , which covers the soviet occupation quite extensively . 
  ( i could really only find it with chinese subtitles , but it is generally in english and when necessary , then the english subtitles are seen as well ), 
  i would n't say there are many neo-communists in estonia . 
  they are just pro-soviet and not in the neo-sense as many have parents or grandparents , who praise them as well . 
  especially if they were sent here by the soviet union and especially so when they were sent here within the framework of the soviet military installations . 
  i 'd imagine our capitalist nightgowns were of far better quality than the regular soviet nightgowns of the 1930s and 1940s . 
  i am not really surprised this kind of propaganda works on russians themselves , but the fact that it works on so many westerners is both appalling and frightening at the same time . 
  yeah , we do n't really distinguish between neo-nazis and pro-soviet people except perhaps that in the rest of the world being neo-nazi is seen negatively anyway and pro-soviet still not that much . 
  that 's why it 's easier to laugh off the neo-nazi bunches , but our main energy goes against everything pro-soviet . 
  stalin had plans to invade germany as well . 
  i am dubious however if you could put regular military deaths in these categories , it is n't usually done in international law . 
  why would you compare the total number of prisoners instead of the share of the deaths from all prisoners ? 
  there is no way you could label stalin as a better guy than hitler . 
  they also could have been homogay nazis : s, 
  or just everything not approved by kremlin . 
  it would n't really be an axis of putin and trump , it would be an axis of putin , which has the power to manipulate trump . 
   hitler killed more people wait , what ?? 
   in fact hitler wanted to empty most of ee and russia of slavs . 
  stalin wanted to keep most of the slavs . 
  did you really just make that comparison ? 
   your counter-argument ? 
  that would presume an argument on your part . 
  how not ? 
   cooperating with your ally the fact that they were allies was the problem in the first place . 
   let 's do the counterfactual : no conferences on spheres of influence . 
  does that change the fighting on the ground between soviets and nazis ? 
   do the soviets stop in bielorussia and say ok , that 's far enough , we do n't want poland ? 
   do you seriously picture the usa invading russia in 1945-6-7 ... ? 
  seriously ? 
   there is nothing the west could have done to stop the ussr from sphering eastern europe well , more or less indeed . 
   conferences were an attempt to limit that . 
  it failed . 
  not only did they fail , they also provided legitimacy for the soviet rhetoric . 
   the betrayal was the appeasement of hitler sure , ca n't argue with that . 
  but as i said , the concept of western betrayal has many different forms and it 's not like this is understood as a betrayal on a general level .

  i showed you ** actual statistics ** , you dimwit ... 
  citizenship of people living in estonia . 
   `` you just do n't know what you 're talking about . 
  i am talking about their actual current citizenship '' , without specifying what that citizenship is . 
  i mean i pretty much started from this . 
  i said they are actual russian citizens . 
   and if citizenship `` depends on the person '' , as you assert , then there is no single `` actual current citizenship '' anyway . 
  actual current citizenship of every single individual . 
  i even showed statistics , but you did n't listen . 
   for someone who decries `` unintelligent '' contributions , you 're not setting a very good example . 
  stop it now , i brought actual statistics and you started blabbering !, 
   but more commonly to the ex soviet countries probably ex-socialist is what you mean . 
   ukraine was n't part of the eastern roman empire either but it 's considered eastern europe . 
  but it was still orthodox . 
   personally i think that greece is generally a better fit in `` southern europe '' along with italy , spain and portugal of course it is . 
  and if we divide the continent by east and west for the cold war era context , then you are definitely western . 
  but people overemphasize the cold war era distinction as it sort of ate up the previous deeper divisions in europe for some reason . 
  might does not make right . 
  i 'm sure you will find far more `` sources '' claiming the us invasion of afghanistan was illegal , while actual sources would claim the opposite . 
  so the illegal occupation should change our centuries old cultural , linguistic and historical groups ? 
  nah , i do n't think the economic differences are that grave between us . 
  so are finland and greece . 
   no , that 's not the only reason . 
  economically and socio politically finland is more like scandinavia , while estonia is more like the baltic states ( with nordic elements ) . 
  do you even listen to yourself ? 
  this is 100 % related to the soviet occupation ...  most maps with regards to economy or politics or opinions will show finland closer to scandinavia and estonia closer to their baltic neighbors . 
  yes , because these are social affairs , where we are still affected by the horrible occupation era . 
  what of it ? 
  there are far deeper affairs at play here ...  why are you so insulted to be group with lithuania and latvia , what did they do to you ? 
  you could learn some insight [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askeurope/comments/6ld126/people_from_baltic_countries_do_you_identify_as/ ) . 
  some people are like you and opt for calling out inferiority and superiority complexes , but luckily saner people understand the major differences between the three countries . 
  it probably would n't if germany were still two states . 
   oh stop crying . 
  for all aluve previous generations the east was the eastern bloc . 
  who 's crying ? 
   it is a geographic rather than a political term nowadays , nothing more . 
  but it is wrong in its geography , it groups northern , central and southern european nations based on a cold war era division . 
  i do n't understand why someone would defend ignorance so strongly . 
  summer ? 
  you take it for something deeper than what it really is . 
  i mean , they are de facto pretty independent in their legislation anyway , are n't they ? 
  this is a random blog , take it for what it is . 
  but the collection of examples are true - if you think any of these facts are incorrect , please do bring them out and i will give you a source . 
   nordic countries have always been iceland , finland , norway , sweden , denmark that standardized concept did n't even exist before the cold war so i do n't know what you 're talking about . 
   estonia wasnt adopted in the list of them . 
  estonia was illegally occupied by the soviet union at that time . 
  what ? 
   i think you need to go brush up on what a oligarchy is considering . 
  i think you need a lesson in political theory . 
   if you consider voting until they get the result they want as a democracy , sure . 
  what ? 
   do you elect the ec members ? 
  does any democracy elect government ministers ? 
   for example i do n't get your example . 
   said that one who thinks russia 's a dictatorship . 
  lol this is such a conventional understanding that it 's hilarious that you argue against that . 
   but if you 're too young to remember putin stepped down between 2008 and 2012 this does n't mean it 's a democracy . 
  things remained very much in his hands . 
   feel free to argue bringing facts to the table but as i said if russia 's a dictatorship the eu 's in the same category idiotic . 
   sometimes the north-south divide is more prominent , sometimes the west-east divide . 
  yes , this is correct . 
  but in the general context , none alone should matter . 
  and the east-west divide did n't originally run along the iron curtain line ... 
   i 'm sorry that my perceptions differ from yours but being insulting is n't likely to change the situation . 
  i 'm sorry to have called out your ignorance . 
  i should have allowed you to remain ignorant . ^ ? 
  only in the sense that the commemoration events in latvia are somewhat bigger . 
  yes , but was n't it still run by baltic germans ? 
  kettler and co. ? 
   the link is to counter your claim that the us does not invade its neighbors . 
  the us has two neighbors with whom it gets along . 
   the us is ** still ** doing it right now in bolivia , venezuela , cuba , and ecuador . 
  the cia had admitted this . 
  now i need proof . 
   there is no excuse for overthrowing a democratically elected or supported regime . 
  gtfo with that fascist trash . 
  there is every excuse if those bastards cooperated with the soviets !, 
   and estonia is both to the north and to the east so it 's not silly to put the baltic states in both categories so is finland , but you did n't put it in two categories . 
  nor did you put v4 into both . 
   also since finland is n't part of scandinavia i would also consider it both northern and eastern yes indeed , but that 's northeastern europe . 
  you made it look like only the baltic states are in both . 
  yeah . . 
  the us is doing no such thing . 
  we are sovereign nations and we alone decide , who to invite here . 
  it is no business of russia . 
  and the us forces are needed as a deterrence from russians invading as they 've done in ukraine . 
  yes , but the entire europe follows that western civilization anyway . 
  the deeper east-west divide arose with the [ east-west schism ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/east%e2%80%93west_schism#/media/file:great_schism_1054_with_former_borders.png ) of 1054 and greece remained in the eastern side . 
  this is a far deeper division in europe than the cold war era east-west divide . 
  never !, 
  i agree that it exists and it is a necessary grouping in * some contexts * ( soviet occupation , relations with russia , common infrastructure projects etc ) , but i would n't really say in the general context again . 
  ghent is the capital of belgium . 
  are you offended or am i just wrong ? 
  nobody is really arguing against the existence of that grouping , it 's just that the grouping is a simplistic generalization itself . 
  it 's a finnic northern european country , just like finland . 
  and the only reason it 's not considered nordic is another cold war era bias ... 
  yes we do that , but why should the east-west divide take precedence over the other ? 
  do n't get me wrong , in many contexts it will forever be ok to call us all eastern european in the cold war era context , but * not * in the general context . 
  and not knowing enough is n't really a reason to lump them together or at least confront people , who correct you . 
   it 's not completely correct , but the further away from home you go , the larger you group peoples together and less important the subdivision become in one 's mind .

  makes sense . 
  ( depends on how to define historic ... before wwii only 3 % of the population spoke russian , so compared to german the russian language is a relatively new entity around these lands . 
  also , according to this newspaper article [ at the end of 16th century estonian swedes made up for 20 % of the population ] ( http://www.postimees.ee/print/1933353/rannarootslaste-kirikuhobe-jai-tolli-kinni ) , so if we look at the wider perspective swedish too has had historic presence for a very long time . 
  anyway , just a random thought . ), 
  edited to include only german . 
   in my case it was french as first foreign language , then english , and russian as third . 
  german was the language of the elite for 700 years in estonia and latvia , right up until 1919 and even under russian empire where they had autonomy . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/baltic_germans about 15 % of our vocabulary comes from low-german . 
  german is very often the second or third language here in schools . 
  why continue keeping him as a mod then ? 
  it 's all hindsight of course , who knows where to draw the line of ` what would 've been the appropriate amount of resistance compared to the deportation and half a century of repression that followed . ', 
  but at the height of stalinism there would not have been many who would 've argued that resisting less had been a good idea . 
  today finlands gdp per capita is 3 times that of estonia 's , i think they 're doing pretty good regardless of the few lost houses .

   prime minister economic affairs minister *, 
   estonian pm andrus ansip said after a meeting of baltic leaders on monday that the question of whether to stretch the rail baltic track to vilnius is for the european commission to decide , not estonia , reports news.err.ee . 
  ... from the article . 
  ^ in estonian sources it was worded more as the way / u/gagatron put it . 
  it 's a discussion that 's been going on for a long time and stir up a bit of drama ( [ recently an estonian mp publicly called lithuania 's colleagues fools ] ( http://news.err.ee/v/politics/74d7598c-210a-4a00-8dba-20a67798235b ) ) , lithuania 's been ` dragging its feet ' to get vilnius included in the new trans-baltic railway route from berlin to tallinn ( and helsinki via ferries ) funded by the eu . 
  adding vilnius is a complication that was not part of the initial plan and increases the budget , work and time considerably , however vilnius amounts to 40 % of lithuanias gdp and is an important link in the nations infrastructure . 
  the indecisiveness between the 3 countries has lead many to see the project already as doomed without ever having even started and the time to create a common company that could present a budget for the eu is quickly running out . 
  a bit more info along with a map for the route : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rail_baltica, 
  i may be a cynic but this seems more like promotion of your blog by stirring up drama about not seeing how american culture is a separate and unique entity in the world . 
  americans have influenced the whole world for more than half a century , it is said usa 's culture is its most successful export . 
  rock and jazz , fast food and hollywood , nike and apple , freedom & democracy ( do n't laugh , in 90s us post-communist countries looked up to usa for its ideology ) etc. 
  even the very pizza you mention was popularized around the world by american citizens . 
  it 's always the outside perspective that determines labels , for an irish-ancestry immigrant from down the street in ny you 're italian , for a southerner you 're probably newyorker , for us europeans you 're american and for a chinese we 're both westerners .

  maybe the bogs ( although bog = * soo * , these areas we call * raba * . 
  a bit different , less muddy , more naturey ) . 
  nothing spectacular , but there 's a nice quietness and a calming feeling to it . 
  afaik logo is only visible on public retail versions , not on the actual olympic clothes ... 
  i 'm fully aware , hence even more reason to end this unfortunate label . 
  it 's misleading , confusing and originates from a mere fact that we were once occupied together and labeled such by some repressive regime from whose point of perspective we were simply `` their states by the side of baltic sea '' , without any further consideration to ingenious people 's self-determination . 
  it makes sense to me that either `` baltic countries '' means `` all countries by the baltic sea '' , or it means just `` latvia and lithuania '' because they are the only ones truly balts . 
  and the expression `` baltic states '' should be slowly phased out as we 're not states of that regime anymore . 
   ( also i 'm fully aware none of this will happen , but one can hope and ignite a discussion ... ) ', 
   baltic languages [ baltic languages ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/baltic_languages ) is a very specific term and only includes latvian and lithuanian which belong to the indo-european language family , where as estonian does not and instead is finno-ugric . 
  sorry if bringing out this fact has become repetitive on this subreddit , but i really feel it 's time to dismantle the `` baltic states '' expression because it 's very misleading . 
  latvians and lithuanians are [ balts ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/balts ) ( aka literally baltic peoples ) and only their countries should be called baltic , unless every country on the baltic sea is called as such . 
  including estonia makes little sense and it 's time to bury this misconception .

  just like soviets ? 
  do n't get me wrong , i understand russians celebrate soviet victory , they paid a high price for that . 
  but the story is very soggy here , they invaded us through a pact with nazis and carried out heavy repressions and then `` forgot '' to leave for nearly half a century . 
  it 's not possible for us to see them us liberators . 
  i have nothing against celebrating allied victory , which we kinda do on 8th may . 
  but why would we do that with soviet union in particular ? 
   wanting to blow up soviet monuments is understandable because they became symbols of subsequent occupation . 
  however , more civilized approach is just to remove them from public places . 
  actually , we have n't even been * that * active in removing them , not to mention not having talks about blowing anything up . 
  lenins are gone , sure , street names are back to pre-wwii , but most of monuments to red army have stayed .

  `` i just want them to leave , '' abramov said . 
  well , too bad , but a majority of estonians support nato troops and people like you make us support them even more . 
   his voice grew impassioned as he spoke of the scale of soviet losses in world war ii . 
  `` i do n't know how to explain it , but for me , the war is not over yet , '' he said . 
  i imagine for you , soviet union is still alive and kicking aswell . 
   for maksimov , a 38-year-old ethnic russian who is between jobs , the decline of the tank was a symbol . 
  he felt the russian side of history , his history , was being written over . 
  and this is the problem with them . 
  this is russian history , not estonian history . 
  you are bringing values and views of a foreign country here and react fiercely when we resist them . 
  this is why the bronze nights and such happen . 
  why are you even living in estonia if you clearly associate with russia ? 
  just to be clear , soviet union invaded and occupied republic of estonia . 
  it 's an enemy of estonia . 
  not to mention it was a bloody brutal dictatorship . 
  we have never had , nor ever will have respect for such regime . 
  if you support it and even worse , its invasion of estonia , you clearly oppose republic of estonia . 
   `` for us , it 's an undividable part of our history . 
  people have to remember what happened and why it happened . 
  people looking at the tank have to remember how big the sacrifice was , '' he said . 
  what sacrifice ? 
  bombing the whole town of narva down ? 
  why would one put a monument to them ? 
  sometimes i feel a temptation to just blow it up , but i 'd rather not fall to soviet level . 
  it was n't even just a disease , two men having sex was a criminal offence in estonian soviet socialist republic , right next to pedophilia in the criminal code . 
  you can imagine why so many of the older generation do n't even make difference between the two . 
  meanwhile , the youth have mostly grown up in a liberal democracy with english and the internet , adopting western values on this question . 
  so / u/sanderrr makes a good point . 
  there 's a massive generational gap here in estonia at least on this particular question , and because we do n't make too many babies , the older generation 's values remain dominant for a long time . 
   because there is no difference in attitude towards lgbt people in both our countries . 
  not all [ polls ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2iwdfa/support_for_gay_marriage_across_europe/ ) give such impression . 
   the younger you are - the more likely you are not to give a fuck . 
  i do n't think apathy towards rights of minorities is the only trend , though . 
  a developed society would care about its own people , not just take a `` meh '' approach . 
  that 's not always the case , though . 
  estonian population was slightly sceptical about joining eu in 2002-2003 ( the government was always strongly pro-eu ) and the 2003 referendum had second lowest result after malta ( 67 % ) . 
  after joining eu , the public support rose fast and has never fallen back to pre-accession levels , despite greek debt crisis , refugee crisis etc. 
   my own views aside , from the perspective of international relations , of course the uk is not going to totally separate its views on nato from its views on trade with baltics . 
  international relations just can not be segmented in that way . 
  i just can not see how making trade between uk and eu difficult is good for nato . 
  nobody here is aiming to make trade between uk and eu difficult , but we 're surely not going to join any support groups for uk . 
  sorry , the united kingdom has been a great partner for estonia in nato , and even supported us in war of independence in 1918-1920 , but some people seem to not understand we 're part of eu . 
  it 's not some kind of a bureaucratic monster governing us . 
  we benefit from it , we depend on it . 
  we 're going to have a negotiation battle and too bad , but uk is going to be on the other side of the table . 
  you chose this . 
   so estonia will work to punish uk , even if uk right now are deploying troops in estonia ? 
  first of all , eu and nato are different organizations and we 're doing what we promised in nato . 
  secondly , no , we do n't want to punish uk and absolutely not are we going to aim for that , but we 're also not going to join some clubs for their support . 
  we are part of eu , so it should be clear which side we 're on in brexit negotiations . 
   big part of investments in estonia exists only because us took your ass in the nato , which also worked as a stepping stone into the eu . 
  nato is more than the usa and how is this even relevant here ? 
  we 're talking about uk in eu and we do n't have any problems with them in nato . 
  we have several countries that are not in eu , but are in nato and vice versa . 
  going back to brexit , do n't forget that latvian and lithuanian emigrants had a noticeable share in the immigrant-hostile sentiment that influenced them to step out of eu . 
  a bit ironic to go supporting the same people now , do n't you think ? 
  nope , i do n't see why we would mix nato with eu . 
  it 's fully in our interests to have a strong united eu . 
  uk is on the other side of the negotiation table , which means we 're going to find a deal that suits * our * interests and if there 's luck , it also suits their . 
  but not necessarily , if uk loses from this , it 's their problem , not ours . 
  also , estonian diaspora in uk is not very big . 
  only if they invaded serbia ( outside kosovo , that is ) . 
  about half of them left in wwi and when estonia became an independent country . 
  that 's because of firstly the war , and secondly , the newly founded state nationalized most of the lands ( germans owned majority of those ) and redistributed them to peasants and war veterans ( that fought for independence ) . 
  some 14 ' 000 germans were resettled to germany in 1939 , as a result of molotov-ribbentrop pact that gave baltics to soviet union , but germans were to be transferred to germany . 
  another 7 ' 000 went to germany when nazis occupied estonia in 1941 . 
  some few who had remained went along with estonians at the mass escape of 1944 when nearly 80 ' 000 people fled estonia . 
  and that 's when basically their centuries long history pretty much came to an end . 
   so then why did you say let it go to me , if you would fight ? 
  because they are not fully comparable . 
  i mean , look at ethnic map of [ estonia ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4a/share_of_estonians.png/1024px-share_of_estonians.png ) . 
  russians are mostly only in soviet-era towns or some in the easternmost enclaces or so , but they make up very small share . 
  they do n't even have a clear territory to take . 
  kosovo was already an autonomous region . 
  they knew what they were fighting over . 
  also , when kosovars strived for independence , then estonia would have a case of invasion . 
  i would absolutely fight against an enemy trying to take my territories . 
  oh , and last but not least . 
  kosovo is already separated and you have a bloody fight which everybody remembers . 
  you wo n't just return to life as usual . 
  we would fight , yes . 
  we 're part of nato , not a clear cut losing fight . 
  besides , russians are mostly concentrated in north-eastern estonia , where river separates estonia from russia . 
  it 's not very easy for russia to send help . 
   you still did n't answer my quesiton . if you let eastern estonia go , would you just ` leave it behind ' ? 
  i think i 've said it many times .

im not so sure about the ramzan 's status as a ` puppet ' . 
  he is more putin 's untamed dog , who would bite it 's master if necessary . 
  and the eu has not said ` no ' to turkey yet . 
  i believe many of them think that lying about being gay makes it easier to get into europe .

  last year 's russian entry was something one might consider as a trolling, 
  he is still a billionaire though . 
  clearly you 've got some personal issues with trump and there is no point to further discuss it . 
  this ' * disaster * ' happened because of bad communication and they could n't hear whose turn was to enter . 
  it 's hardly a good reason to call somebody an idiot . 
  he might be a weirdo , yes , but i have no doubt that he is smarter than you . 
  the man is a billionaire for fucks sake . 
  it takes some brains to get and/or hold onto that status . 
  he is just saying what people think , it 's called populism . 
  he is a smart man , im sure he knows whats really going on . 
  crazy buffoon would n't be a serious candidate for us presidency . 
  im sure he knows what he is doing and he is well aware of what he is saying . 
  he is a very good manipulator . 
  why ? 
  is it because england = britain for you ? 
  i understand that ` reality ' . 
  these people are not leaving it behind , they 're bringing it into eu . 
  were you in coma during 2015 or you just do n't read the news ? 
  jesus , i wonder why ... 
  do you still think that this is about skin color ? 
   xenophobic good one, 
  slovenia has mountains n shit, 
  this shit is getting ridiculous here and our conservative party is to blame for ` making a problem ' of refugees and same-sex marriages . 
  refugees are a pseudo problem over here . 
  we have none of them here yet some people act like k\u00f6ln events are happening here daily . 
  if i were to create a maoist dandelion - and fern loving club and it suddenly gets media attention , then i could expect a huge growth in popularity and membership ? 
  there is a reason why soldiers of odin is popular right now , and it 's not only because of media . 
  even nazis before rising to power were considered a joke , but people joined them . 
  then why did they start doing whatever they 're doing until recently ? 
  i think that means the people are angry at the government, 
  worst enemy is definitely russia . 
  closest rivals are our baltic bastards latvia and lithuania . 
  you realise that nato is an independent and separate organization ? 
  nato countries were , but they were not representing nato . 
  it was us-led coalition that consisted of several nato members . 
  nato was in iraq and libya ? 
  come on russia , you 're poor and miserable as fuck . 
  you ca n't handle another cold war . 
  honestly that makes it even worse . 
  what a terrible loss for finland . 
  i think it 's because of bureaucracy and stupid laws . 
  they do n't have any documents to prove their age , so they are as old as they claim to be . 
  and do n't you dare to do any age-related tests on them or you 'll be racist . 
  we had 3 and we were declared judenfrei on january 20 , 1942 . 
  on the other hand one can say that we 're efficient . 
  best anthem - estonia worst anthem - finland,

  these manors are not in one of the most important places in the country . 
  very small amount of estonians are orthodox , a couple thousand at best . 
  and the numbers are declining every year and there is no chance that orthodox estonians are going to outnumber the lutherans . 
  it 's a * russian orthodox * church , not just a church . 
  embassy of russia has nothing to do with estonia , it 's a much needed political establishment . 
  this has nothing to do with estonian culture . 
  these are beliefs , opinions and lifestyles which change over time . 
  it 's very un-estonian and oddly enough it is symbol of estonia for foreigners and i think it is wrong . 
  nevsky cathedral is crown jewel for the russians of estonia and it 's right in the middle of our capital city . 
  one of the reasons it was built was to remind us that `` russians are our overlords '' forever . 
  and it 's beauty is very subjective , i for example do n't find russian architecture and style beautiful . 
  [ estonian hero ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyyw8s7uyru ), 
  well , swedes are experts on shitholes though . 
  i hope one day nevsky cathedral will be blown up or sold to russia . 
  and corsica belongs either to estonia , germany , croatia or macedonia . 
   not exactly a role model whose words should be regarded as wisdom . 
  why ? 
  the thing he said about democracy is right though . 
  and he did not break any laws by moving to switzerland . 
  pretty smart in my opinion . 
  how are opinions and business connected ? 
   you are a bit over stereotyping here imo . 
  i get your point , but not all roma grups are the same . 
  maybe , but im speaking from my experience . 
  there are a few gypsies living in the outskirts of my town , sometimes hanging around the bus station . 
  they look extremely stereotypical - fur coats , jewellery , gilded phones . 
  one of them is an older lady who is receiving a social service , so my mother is sometimes visting her . 
  she lives in this run down house that has a huge fucking chandelier in the living room . 
  her house always smells of incense and her lifestyle ( food , clothes , etc ) could n't possibly covered by her welfare alone . 
  so she is getting money from somewhere . 
  and also the capital of gypsies in the baltics is valga/valka . 
  one of my relatives lives there and the gypsies are stealing her firewood , and basically everything that is left unattended . 
   that could be said for any rural area . 
  including estonians living in soviet block houses in the middle of nowhere , but driving bmws . 
  not really . 
  the soviet block houses are mostly in capitals where there is work . 
  those apartments have low maintenance costs and most of those young lads can afford to rent a decent bmw . 
  and our rural areas are not like that , those are pretty depressing .

  i 'm pretty sure all nato countries would help as much as they can , or they 'd get booted and left to fend for themselves and i doubt it would stop at military help , it would have serious economical consequences aswell , not to mention the international shame ( which is actually a much bigger thing than it sounds ) . 
  i agree about asia completley , it would show china that nato is a joke and they have their eyes on a lot of island etc they 'd happily invade . 
  i 'm sorry , but this absolutely makes no sense : 1 . 
  what education opportunities does a 16 year old boy with undefined education , who does n't speak german have in germany ? 
  why would you afford anything more in western europe , than you would in lebanon on turkey ? 
  just an economic migrant . 
  people are getting killed in turkey ? 
  is football banned in turkey ? 
  so just seeking better welfare in europe ? 
  turkey already took you in , why do you need to come to europe ? 
  so they 've been in a safe country for 2 years and 355 days , but now come to greece ? 
  another person who almost died to better his economic position ? 
  maybe it 's something we should n't encourage ? 
  no war in turkey and a dozen other countries that are much closer than germany . 
  i probably come off as cold , but literally every single one of those people are no longer fleeing for their life , but just searching for better welfare/economic opportunities . 
  europe ca n't host all the world 's poor , and what 's worse they 're dying and putting their life in danger because we 're incentivizing this . 
  this is a great response , thank you !, 
  do you think companies who work on synchronous translations could put you out of business any time soon , or do you think that time is still a long while away ? 
  we only care about our guy , the bigger organizations can play their games , we 're happy as long as we got our guy back . 
  if the informant is russian , where else would he meet him ? 
  at a border crossing where there are russian officers ? 
  we are a tiny country , we do n't care about teaching russia a lesson , we just want to do our thing . 
  do you really believe , estonia a tiny country of 1,3 million people could give two shits about spying on russia ? 
  we have reasonable access to us , uk and nato intelligence , why would we send a publicly known intelligence officer to russia ? 
  it would make absolutely no sense . 
  yes , tiny estonia is trying to destabilize russia by sending our spies there , you 've caught us red handed . 
  really , try to think for a moment . 
  [ already on it . 
  ] ( http://balticbusinessnews.com/article/2015/8/25/estonia-may-build-a-high-tech-fence-on-border-with-russia ), 
  we got our guy back , at the end of the day , it 's all that matters . 
  russia has such a spotless record of being honest after all , and estonia has been constantly getting caught lying , oh wait , or was it vice versa ? 
  can you give me some examples of this `` hate-speech '' ? 
  edit : \\* crickets \\* , an hour has passed , you 've posted comments since , but unsurprisingly , you ca n't back up your claim . 
  so what is that supposed to prove ? 
  that an internal security officer was carrying a weapon , money and a recorder ? 
  he was meeting with an informant at the border , of course he 's gon na have that stuff . 
  no , not everyone , just you , because you constantly spam pro-russian propaganda and that 's all you ever do . 
  paywall, 
  do n't bother , he 's a long established putinbot . 
  what did we confirm ? 
  he has always been an internal security service agent and very publicly so . 
  this is fucking awesome news , i 'm so happy . 
  a lot of estonians are gon na have a party tonight . 
  i do n't think i 've heard them for a while , but like ~ 10-15 years ago yes , i guess it was because there were a lot of elderly finnish tourists here who were often obese . 
  well there go the fat finn jokes ... 
  it 's a great video , but it has been posted a billion times here already . 
  lithuania has more sun than us and also they 're an entirely different country with entirely different people . 
  suicide rates have dropped heavily , i 'd say we 're doing pretty okay . 
  i like the dark . 
  estonians are n't indigenous to our country ? 
  i really liked this one - https://youtu.be/32vlogn_3qq, 
  1939-1991 for estonia . 
  this is very true , i saw some article once that showed how most of the pro-immigration party leaders in sweden live in all swedish neighborhoods . 
  they do n't practice what they preach . 
   i foresee a more pro-migrant/quota stance , because this scandal will be on everyone 's mind quite some time . 
  not a chance , this does n't gauge the interest of the public nearly as much as the refugee crisis . 
  people are only becoming more and more anti-refugee according to polls . 
  i do n't see this changing . 
  this does n't come as much of a surprise for most estonians , there have been scandals before , but he has managed to wiggle out of them . 
  his party is hugely popular among our russians , some say that it 's a good thing that he 's collecting all their votes , instead of it going to some actual batshit crazy pro-kremlin party . 
  if he turns out to be guilty , i 'm very happy that our agencies work and such behavior is dealt with . 
  the recent news quote figures in hundreds of thousands of euros , so not exactly breaking the bank here , not to excuse him if he is guilty , but it 's still important to understand that the scale was rather small . 
  because we want to participate in the common market ? 
  our pm has said multiple times that we wo n't support mandatory quotas , that distribution of refugees must be in a purely voluntary basis . 
   / u/ragnar _ ok actual srs mods were busy , so you had to do with a guy who moderates / r/circlebroke as a compromise ? 
  i think it 's pretty much equivalent of adding some / r/european mods on / r/europe . 
  nothing good will come of it . 
  i do n't know how appropriate it is to post it here , though . 
  `` what the migrants are going through is almost as terrible as working for us . '', 
  should be their slogan . 
  estonia actually has quite low emigration rates per capita , twice smaller than latvia and lithuania . 
  our unemployment is very low and i think our growth will only increase as well . 
  there was even a meme about it on the front page of / r/sweden , can you try searching for it in swedish ? 
  because i 'm having trouble searching for it in english because i do n't remember the exact details . 
  i think the thing with portugal is that they 're in a very good geographical location to do this , if estonia were to do the same , we 'd get a lot of narco tourists . 
  what do you define as western-europe ? 
  estonia has already surpassed portugal , i doubt we 'll stop there . 
  in many non-economic indicators like education , corruption , e-services and much else we already either beat or are at similar levels as western-europe . 
  i 'm sure we 'll catch up , i think it 's very likely we 'll even surpass many , it 's just a matter of time . 
  you mean like the incident in sweden , where some home appliance caught fire in a refugee center and then the pm and everyone else came out to condemn the racists for setting fire to refugee centers ? 
  is . . is . . that allowed ? 
  estonia is n't . 
  how are you this bad at math ? 
  except because family reunification laws , you can expect about 3 people in addition to every migrant taken , also the 530 is probably only a start . 
  also you 're terrible at math , 530 of 1,3 million is 0.04 % not 0.0004 % . 
  apparently it was ordered from china , but i think barbed wire is a thing the military also has heaps of . 
   edit : i have nothing against estonians , but i 'm just pointing your nonsense , i do n't think you 're a good representant of estonia , if you ca n't even admit your country 's crimes . 
  my country has done no crimes , saying a small number of idiots collaborating with nazi war crimes has anything to do with estonia , which was officially neutral and one of the most jew friendly countries in the world according to jews themselves , is like saying what breivik did was norway 's crime as a country . 
  it 's beyond retarded . 
   i do n't think my job is to educate you about ww2 . 
  if you want to `` educate someone about ww2 '' , you should first have at least some grasp of it . 
   please delete your post ( my post are being deleted too ) i will not , because everything i 've said is verifiably true , there 's no reason why i should shield your ignorance from others / u/ama _ deo . 
   the ww2 and ability to legally cleaning `` the nordic race '' ( which is rather funny considering estonians have nothing to do with nordic race ) verified the estonian antisemitism where are you getting this ? 
  are you making it up on the spot ? 
  what 's `` nordic race '' anyway ? 
   only one there who ca n't read is you , because all i mentioned was ww2 , i do n't care about interwar period . 
  people who did holocaust in estonia were estonians , not germans . 
  that 's all . 
  `` the final acts of liquidating the camps , such as klooga , which involved the mass-shooting of roughly 2,000 prisoners , were carried out by german units belonging to the schutzmannschaftsbataillon of the kds . 
  survivors report that , during these last days before liberation , when jewish slave labourers were visible , the estonian population in part attempted to help the jews by providing food and other types of assistance . '' '',

  estonian russians score above oecd average in pisa and timss tests ( while using russian language in the test ) , but 90 % of estonian russians still vote for putin 's party . 
  they were the 5th column from the start , for many generations . 
   compared to two working parents with a kid or two who has zero time to do that , i know who i think would make the more informed vote . 
  that is not what you know , that is what you want to believe in ( or rather , what you want others to believe in ) . 
   but how do you know all of this ? 
  all the reasoning you just gave is just your personal negative opinions . 
  how ? 
  by logic . 
  and the facts support the logic . 
  t.h.ilves . 
   i would be far more concerned about a politician 's business interests than their city of birth . 
  is that not a much more severe conflict of interest ? 
  that goes hand-in-hand . 
  those without a homeland live for profit . 
   and why do you think local problems are somehow unique and special ? 
  because the local environment is special . 
  and the native culture has adapted to the local environment . 
  that is enviro 101 . 
   it sounds like you 're totally overexagerating how individual your culture is . 
  you could homogenize it if you make all people live in the `` corridors of brussels '' . 
   being a politician is not a cultural job , it 's a project management job . 
  you are still servicing the citizens . 
  native citizens , not internationalists . 
   everything you worry about was safeguarded long , long ago . 
  you are so persuasive , but your mind control techniques do not work in this case . 
  bestonia - most lynx per km2 . 
  wifi everywhere and the nearest large predator ( lynx , bear , wolf ) only 3km away ( edit : if you are lucky , that is ) . 
  they will cross the frozen water bodies in winter , up to 10km across i think . 
  with statements . 
  and acts to promote mass immigration . 
   why do n't we just use referendums to vote for every single decision a country needs to take ? 
  indeed !, 
  we should and we could !, 
  e-stonia is technically ready for it , but our establishment does not want to relinquish control . 
   we do n't because most people will never fully understand what they are voting and will often do what the newspaper they read tells them is best . 
  your mistake is to assume that parliament members are above average intelligent . 
  they are n't . 
  they might have above average social intelligence , but funnily their general intelligence is not above average ( or is hampered by distorted motivations ) . 
  and even if the parliament members were more intelligent , democracy would still demand to follow the will of the citizens , not the will of the parliamentarians . 
   but we both know its not . 
  you are persuasive , but your mind control techniques failed in this case . 
  regardless of what i think , such propaganda `` programs '' are counterproductive . 
  erasmus in the form of 10-20 % of total students is ok . eu army should at first be built up as national armies and regional task forces within nato . 
  basically there should not be any eu army , it should be the european part of nato . 
  cross border cultural events ??? 
  those have been going on for ages . 
  let it be natural . 
  keep your propaganda away from it . 
  i fear for the confederation of switzerland . 
  the end is nigh . 
   there are globalists all over the world who do n't favour authoritarianism or forced homogenisation or state controlled capitalism . 
  globalists who do n't favor forced homogenisation ? 
  but they do favor global homogenisation , just not openly `` forced '' ? 
  covert brainwashing would be ok i guess . 
   well , i completely agree with you , globalism kind of favors capital the most as it currently stands . 
  but those are merely the many facets of the komintern . 
  soviet union was just one of those facets . 
  those supporting mass immigration into the eu are another facet . 
  there are surely more than just the two facets . 
  but the uniting theme of all those facets is the `` soviet people '' or `` international people '' . 
  so i was not assuming you to be a stalinist . 
  i am not ruling it out either . 
   how is this impossible to achieve by having parliamentary democracies ? 
  it is not impossible , but it ( representation of the will of citizens on every issue ) requires constant checking . 
   if it is possible for parliamentary ones , and the eu has been steadily moving towards one since the europarls inception , then your criticism towards the eu can only be that is has not yet arrived at its final destination . 
  eu is moving backwards . 
  any further obfuscation layer does not eliminate the need for constant checking . 
   that , however , was not your criticism . 
  yours was that there was no ability to `` touch eurocrats '' , even tough it is precisely the europarl which , at the beginning of each legislative period , both elects the candidate that forms the government and must accept , by vote , each member of that candidate 's formed government . 
  in short , if the peoples ' representatives do not want a person to be part of the government , then that person will not be part of the government . 
  your mistake is to assume that you can disaggregate an aggregated vote . 
  you ca n't possibly do that , not without polls and/or referendums on each and every issue . 
   how is that untouchable , or less touchable than in other parliamentary democracies ? 
  that is the standard way in which parliamentary democracies legitimise , form and challenge governments . 
  by the mere fact that juncker has made many quite outlandish statements on `` how to keep the stupid people away from decisionmaking '' . 
   edit . 
  which means that representative democracy has to have constant checks whether the representatives are following the will of the citizens or not . 
   is precisely fulfilled by the above mechanism conditional on people actually caring for and electing their parliament en masse . 
  which has not happend , but which is a social , not an institutional problem most likely due to the fact that most people are unaware of the europarls expanded powers under lisbon . 
  nope . 
  read above about the impossibility of disagregation of aggregated votes . 
   dude , just because they are corrupt , does n't mean brussels is buying . 
  in this case , companies and criminals are not a substitute for brussels crats . 
  an addition , perhaps . 
  actually juncker and merkel have been working to the benefit of kremlin , more than any euro-sceptic party . 
   there are almost no popular movements to move away from the eu and frankly if there was than they should leave , i happen to agree with juncker 's comments . 
      if countries are n't invested into it than they should leave ( that 's what the efta is for ) , i 'd be fine with every eu country deciding that , although it should be in the form of voting for a party , referendums are in general a pretty horrible idea . 
  i was just gon na suggest that you should demand annual referendums on the exit issue , but it seems that you are indeed fully in agreement with mr. juncker who believes that democracy means no referendums , especially on exits . 
   but why ? 
  they have a job to do , they are the best applicant for said job , why does it matter where they were born ? 
  because their job is to follow and represent the will of the citizens , of which the majority are natives . 
  thus those who are born ( and/or lived for a long time ) elsewhere , are not fit for the job . 
  sooner or later such individuals will misread their citizens because they lack the necessary background experience from having lived among them . 
   now , i think that the perception of common history is much the same as the perception of the nation state and is only seen as such because it is tradition . 
  it is so because it is an evolutionary trait . 
  just like sub-species and sub-populations . 
  it is a natural part of social evolution and it will remain so . 
  even if you try to eradicate those `` parishes '' , they will regenerate themselves eventually . 
  a social contract rarely works in a multikulti society . 
  you do not have much experience from the ussr , do you ?

  international news , russians on reddit , social media etc. 
  is n't it in french ? 
  because the debt greece owes is mostly owned by other eu members , so there was a hope that if we give some more help they 'd get on their feet and pay most of it back , which is a lot better than not getting anything back . 
  this did n't work , so now we lose even more money and the value of the euro will become worse . 
  so basically , in hindsight , it was a mistake . 
  i do n't know if this has been said before , but big props to / r/europe moderators for stepping up and doing these megathreads in a nice and informative manner . 
  it must take some effort to put all of this together . 
  what does that mean ? 
  are neo-nazis completely ostracized from normal society in germany ? 
  are they all unemployed ? 
  do they have no friends ? 
  our politicians are most likely influenced by finland too somewhat , since finland tries to act very friendly towards russia . 
  well , we 're trying . 
  we just single-handedly blocked lifting travel bans from russian officials who wanted to attend the osce assembly . 
  seems we 're doing something wrong , i wonder what it is . 
  our media does n't really discuss russia a lot , it 's just what i 've heard here and there . 
  i would n't say people here are russophobic , just keeping our guard up , because history and recent events . 
  it 's not as bad as it seems really . 
  yes , because it 's illegal and you got to prison for selling or wearing one . 
  so what would they do ? 
  destroy the shop ? 
  why would the shopkeeper care about the reactions , when he 's still making money ? 
  there are plenty of neo-nazis in germany ( and pretty much every other country in the world ) who would buy that crap . 
  are you hinting at ukraine ? 
  ukraine is in chaos , there are other factors at play . 
   the biggest problem here are stray dogs though . 
  : s we still do n't have proper services who take care of that ... kek , seems like such a bizarre problem , never had such issues here , but one step at a time i guess . 
  at least things are moving in the right direction . 
  i hope you guys will join eu eventually . 
  the only reason you ca n't is because it 's banned . 
  that 's pretty great , i doubt we have something like that in estonia , although our gdp ppp is over two times higher than serbia , they just sometimes go around and clean some stuff up , but the amount of graffiti people are doing has gone down as well . 
   if it was a complete taboo these graffiti would 've been gone by long already , yet they stayed for some months . 
  i do n't think many balkan countries spend much money on removing graffiti . 
  it 's expensive and it is a billion times easier to graffiti than to clean it off , so it 's a losing battle anyway unless you direct a lot of effort . 
  some 15 years ago , when estonia was still very poor , we had issues with graffiti as well , drawings of dicks and w/e stayed up for months or years . 
  i mean there still are some issues , but to a much smaller degree now . 
  so no , graffiti does n't mean the entire country likes the pictures of penises , it just means the country lacks the resources to clean it up . 
  that 's like saying `` i saw a swastika graffiti in germany , i guess they 're all still assholes . . '' it seems rather peculiar to me that when there are muslim terror attacks in europe , the sentiment here is \\ #notallmuslims , but you see some graffiti and t-shirts in serbia , `` welp , fuck the entire country '' . 
   i think all phobias are irrational honestly . 
  it does n't really matter what you think , phobia is an irrational fear by * definition * . 
  if it is n't irrational it stops being a phobia . 
  i 'm a bit disappointed it was n't estonia , are n't we the ones russia likes to cry about the most ? 
  what is filling out income tax ? 
  because hitler was a nationalist , so a lot of people go `` well hitler was a bad guy , he was a nationalist , ergo nationalism is bad '' . 
  which is a logical fallacy . 
  there 's nothing wrong with `` identifying with , or becoming attached to , one 's nation . '', 
  as wikipedia defines it . 
  there are of course nationalists who distort this to mean that other nations and people are inferior , as hitler did , which is of course dumb . 
  if you do n't consider those people , nationalism can be a good thing , since it promotes social cohesion , gives people the feeling of belonging ( which is very important for the human psyche ) and makes people want to contribute to the betterment of their nation . 
  which means less crime and corruption and more hard working individuals . 
  i believe a lot of the problems in third-world countries stem from lacking a national identity , they do n't give a shit about their country so they emigrate , take bribes , vandalize etc. 
  ( not everyone of course ) all european countries and people are nationalist to some degree , even when they do n't realize this themselves , or we 'd be all living in sweden , finland or uk . 
  we would n't have borders , we would grant anyone citizenship , start using the english language instead etc. 
  saying nationalism is inherently hateful is like saying because someone likes chocolate chip ice cream , he must think strawberry ice cream is shit . 
  really germany ? 
  this is the direction you want to be heading in this day and age ? 
   `` i heard good news about england . 
  they give you a house and some money to spend and live . 
  and then they give them the opportunity to study , to have a good life . '', 
  it seems like a lot of these migrants are severely misinformed , but lies like those are how smugglers increase their business . 
  maybe eu should advertise in those countries that it 's a life threatening trip , most get deported and there are n't many benefits and maybe the people trying to come to eu would decrease . 
  that 's why you see all these migrants complaining about their treatment , that they 're living in overcrowded housing with little money etc , they were completely misinformed what it would be like here . 
  it 's a joke , it 's like saying we used to drive bmw 's from germany but now we drive lada 's from russia . 
  there 's nothing really wrong with your beef , it 's just romania still has the image of a poor country with lower standards in the mind of a lot of people , so people joke over it . 
  but there are countries with much higher unemployment and lower crime than belgium same with alcoholism and drugs , and i doubt belgium for some reason has worse parents than other countries . 
  so it 's not because people are poor , it 's because other people are richer that makes them break the law ? 
  if crime is heavily correlated with socio-economic status , then why do countries where the `` middle class '' is worse off than the poor in belgium have much lower crime ? 
  i know plenty of estonians working in norway , never had any problems . 
   military is not meant to be used for these kinds of things . 
  yes , guarding and defending an area is completely out of the scope of what military is about . 
  the title leaves the wrong impression , he accused the ep of being like nazis on the issue of forcing unification . 
  he was n't glorifying nazism . 
  is this the case in sweden and norway ? 
  well , guess they can go back then , if it 's so bad here . 
  aww shit , son , it 's official now . 
  i mean if finland can into scandinavia , why not estonia too \\ ^ \\ ^ . 
  i do n't this is universal , estonia for example has n't had any populist parties in power since we regained independence in 1991 , even the party who made really though decisions about austerity during the economic crisis got elected back . 
  although the last elections populist parties had a stronger presence in the votes , but did not get into the coalition . 
  i think the solution is education , the more smarter and well informed the populance , the better parties get into government . 
  if anything i 'd blame a lot of the media for having strong biases and skewing the public perceptions . 
   the updated legislation will also allow hungary reject asylum claims from people travelling from syria , iraq or afghanistan through other so-called safe countries without asking for asylum there . 
  why is this not the norm everywhere ? 
  good riddance , is a strong sentiment here . 
  they do n't pay taxes and they 're not responsible with their finances , so we do n't see how poorer countries like estonia who have been ridiculously responsible should pick up the tab after them . 
  the only way they 'll learn to be more responsible in the future and pay their taxes is * if it all comes crashing down , maybe they 'll stop electing these populist politicians and start being responsible . 
  used more oil shale and other resources we have ourselves or can import from better countries . 
  the amount of gas we import is small , we are n't dependent on it , we could function fine without it . 
  if we get some cheap gas , we 'll use it , but we are n't dependent on it . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/russo-georgian_war we saw russia is back at its old ways again and that we ca n't rely on anything from them . 
  this is great , but we do n't even really use gas , it makes up a small fraction of our total energy use and we 'd be pretty much okay without it , so statements like these can be very misleading :  in terms of gas supple , estonia is the least independent nation of the entire 28 nations of the european union . 
  i always wondered that how can they afford all the ads , who would pay for these live chats , i guess very very many people would ... 
  planning to do so , but 2 people can only achieve so much . . : <, 
  if there were 5,1 million estonians living in estonia , we 'd be doing really good tbh . 
  at the moment it 's 900 000 . 
  for fuck sake , we 're already an endangered species , ca n't we catch a break . 
  the guardian has been going down hill for a while now , imo . 
  japan really dislikes russia , right ? 
  somebody stealing the purse would make sense , sad that there are such bastards who would do that . . 
  that 's rather peculiar , who walks around without a wallet , unless you live somewhere close by . 
   the woman was 25 to 45 years old also , what ?

how is thinking that putin is a strong leader and shooting down russian planes if they do n't stop their idiocy contradicting each other ? 
  you want to call nordic countries socialist because they are successful and actual socialist countries are state capitalist because they are poor . 
  this way you end up with the cold war being a conflict between socialist usa and state capitalist ussr and socialism prevailed . 
  nordic countries are not socialist . 
  they are free market capitalist . 
  we did receive 7 refugees , but that was in 2016 , so could n't have been counted . 
  it is mostly russians and ukrainians . 
  statistics website does n't have 2015 data queriable yet , but in 2014 the largest number of immigrants ( 747 ) came from russia followed by 428 from ukraine . 
  mostly russians and ukrainians . 
  7 % was within the old borders . 
  according to this https://et.wikipedia.org/wiki/venestamine#venestamine_20._sajandil it was 97.1 % estonian in 1945 within the new borders . 
  what your chart shows is the mass immigration from russia during the russian occupation and then some of the recent arrivals leaving after the collapse of the soviet union . 
  it does not show the number of estonians . 
   genetics has no part in this . 
  it 's the culture that 's rotten . 
  agree . 
  did n't claim otherwise in any of my posts . 
  rotten russian revanchist chauvinist imperium yearning culture . 
   there 's really not a lot of difference between the estonian and russian cultures . 
  somebody said it and i thought it was you , paravin . 
  `` russians emigrate to riga and instead of embracing the country they escaped to they proclaim that they are creating a new russia , but without putin , there '' . 
  it was one of the latvian posters . 
  if russians gain power in estonia then the democracy and human rights are done with . 
  it is not about some genes for most of these who are worried about the russian immigration . 
  it is about losing our freedom and our way of life . 
  and this way of life is being quite free not only compared to russia , but compared to pretty much every country in the world . 
  soviet union had millions of people dying at the time when they were exporting food . 
  they claim it just happened by accident because ledgers were read wrong or something . 
  that shows how little it took . 
  how well would they have done if it were n't for american lend-lease aid of food , trucks and whatever the fuck else . 
  read your own post . 
  maybe you meant something different , but what you wrote was : ethnic cleansing did not harm you . 
   because why would we want to preserve such a shitty culture ? 
  are you perhaps a well meaning russian in estonia , who ca n't for the world figure out why these fucking subhuman natives are not lining behind your ideas ? 
  do you really maintain that mass immigration that almost made estonians a minority in our own country did n't harm us and is n't still causing harm ? 
  i suspect you probably just do n't know . 
  so what you are basically saying is that you do n't approve americans saving russian asses in ww2 and you 'd rather have had your kind be exterminated ? 
  i saw that next generation with gastrollers mixed in in 2007 . 
  2014 is also the latest that i can figure out how to query . 
  immigration saldo : russia +559 ukraine +402 america +130, 
  brussels had 90 % of the molenbeek kids calling the bombers heroes . 
  you understood it wrong . 
  the reassessment of population made immigrants from eu larger , because the earlier counting methods were less accurate . 
  immigration is still mostly from russia . 
  it is not given . 
  we are now living in a world of global communication through tv and internet . 
  the pressure to integrate is not there any more . 
  getting more and more of effectively monolingual russian speakers is not good for estonia . 
  even countries with far less immigrant population and far less threatened by a propaganda from a hostile neighbor are in trouble . 
  use this - https://translate.google.com/#ru/en/ - write in phonetic latin and then correct any mistakes with the on screen keyboard coming from pressing the keyboard button . 
  estonia is one example of that kind of country . 
  being enslaved by soviet russia and filled with massive amount of unwanted immigrants seriously harmed us . 
  during the soviet occupation estonia was targeted by mass immigration of russians . 
  the legacy of that is that there is a large group of people who think that estonia would be a wonderful country with it 's relatively high living standards and pleasant society if it were n't for these fucking estonians here and wait for russian tanks to invade and restore their status as the master race . 
  most of the immigrants to estonia nowadays are russians , out of whom many will join these people . 
  it is not a blessing . 
  it really is n't . 
  that statement is about the change of assessment due to updated methodology . 
  the actual immigrants coming in are mostly russians and ukrainians . 
  the largest single group of immigrants has been russians from russia for a while with ukrainian citizens hitting a spike in 2015 . 
  nope . 
  i was just wondering what the first results will show when you type in `` why does estonia hate russia '' and thought that maybe you know enough russian to type in that google query . 
  can you write in russian language ? 
  what do the links coming up with that search tell them ? 
  http://diplomafraud.com/2013/02/21/fake-doctorates-russia-to-crack-down-on-academic-fraud/  twenty-four out of 25 ph. 
  d. theses checked by a special government commission at the university turned out to have extensive plagiarisms and numerous violations of doctoral requirements . 
  unscrupulous `` researchers '' had copied up to 90 per cent of their dissertations from other sources . 
  [ ... ]  prime minister dmitry medvedev admitted the exposed cases were the tip of an iceberg . 
  `` the number of phony doctorates surpasses all possible limits , '' mr. medvedev said . 
  [ ... ]  the market of fake university diplomas and postgraduate degrees has flourished in russia after the fall of the soviet union . 
  according to some estimates , 30 to 50 per cent of academic degrees have been purchased . 
  might have something to do with estonia 's very generous parent welfare - 435 days of previous average salary . 
  economic crises was driving the unemployment up and a lot of people might have thought that now is a good time to have a baby before they lose their job anyway . 
  maybe otherwise they were planning to have a baby after couple of years so this brought 2010 higher and made the next couple of years lower . 
  tell that to native americans . 
  we had climate in estonia too some 25 years ago . 
  it truly is a horrible thing . 
  weird ruling , but 6 months jail for trying to steal one sausage seems also excessive . 
  edit : is italy 's legal system precedent based at all ? 
  would make sense if it is n't and the judge just thought 6 months for one sausage is too much and that is why he let the guy go . 
  why is vilnius called portugal ? 
  so they are russian imperialists looking to restore the situation where all nations live together under the guidance of great russians and everybody is happy as long as these lesser nations remember their place . 
  according to russia they have never sent tanks there and yet there are several hundreds . 
  russia has lied so much that no one takes them seriously any more . 
  net receipts were $ 473.8, 
  / r/imperiumrojava is not an optimist . 
  he just has an agenda . 
  in his world these 4000 troops are both a real threat and provocation against russia that russia must respond to and nothing because russia is invincible , but he still argues against having the baltics protected every chance he gets . 
  i have no doubt that people like him would be the loudest voices among those saying the baltics are at fault and nato should do nothing should the baltics be invaded by russia . 
  180 degree turn from his current advocacy that nato should leave the baltics unprotected because they have nothing to fear . 
  i am glad that in estonia the russian gangsters were just killed . 
  that was certainly not in line with traditional rule of law and due process , but we adopted these things after the gangsters were all dead . 
   equality - remember that in the ussr ppl were equal . 
  the demographic situation was great back then . 
  that is nonsense . 
  during the soviet occupation the demographic situation was that of mass immigration of russians , who were of course more equal than the other `` equals '' . 
  you might as well praise german demographic situation should they get some 50 million refugees and lament it when by some miracle these refugees would go back some time in the future . 
  russia would always manage to give an excuse to the pathetic russiaboos . 
  finland would be guilty of being invaded by russia in case of russian invasion in the eyes of people like you . 
  you see how weak eu is .

  can these parts of the eu be considered european though ?

  this is getting ridiculous . 
   not to get in the way of an eastern european europe `` are n't we amazing '' party , because this sub hates acknowledging reality that is n't ` nice ' , but you 're nowhere close to the west yet . 
  you can blame russia if it makes you feel better , but you 're a wasteland economically . 
  wow , people like you ... 
  estonia/latvia v finland , czech republic v austria etc. 
   in relation you 're doing well . 
  we really did n't claim we were n't . 
  the point is that we were remarkably poorer thanks to soviet-imposed socialism and it will affect us for a long time to come , although at a naturally declining rate . 
  i 'm sorry , but the term `` soviet bloc '' is seldom used as the word `` soviet '' could be used for the soviet union only and not for other socialist states . 
  so , if you are from a supposedly richer country , does it mean that you personally know more about economics ? 
  yep , that 's exactly how economics work . 
  ah , so besides being unintelligent and arrogant , you are also ridiculous . 
  but definitely not an exception on how socialism can ruin your economy for a long time . 
  as long as soviet-imposed policies have an effect on us . 
  and that 's gon na be a long , long time . 
  ah , so you 're not only unintelligent , but also arrogant . 
  that is so often the case however . 
   you 've had almost 30 years . 
  what have you achieved ? 
  reached first world levels in two or three decades ? 
  if that 's not a lot , then i do n't know what is . 
   stop whining finally and get your shit together . 
  quite high and mighty for an ignorant person . 
   look at ireland , look at south korea , look at hong kong i do n't remember them being socialist countries once . 
   look at china ... what exactly is there to look at ? 
   now it 's no one 's fault , just yours . 
  face it . 
  all we can face is your lack of intelligence . 
   from 1945-1990 . 
  why is it still like this now ? 
  how naive can a person be ? 
  you mean the political ideology was n't the same as the theoretical philosophy ? 
  well , of course . 
  which is interesting because they are n't among the former soviet bloc . 
  so yes , that explains the difference between two germanys . 
  but other countries were n't that much poorer before socialism than they were in the end of socialism . 
   estonians say germans were good to them ... lol . 
  they were not good , but almost everyone looks good next to the soviets . 
  it was [ nowhere near as dramatic ] ( http://i.imgur.com/eargijs.jpg ) as it was when the wall fell . 
   my dear commie friend ugh, 
  i calculated the gdp and gdp per capita growths from your table for decades : gdp : - east : 97 % , 55 % , 45 % , 27 % - west : 119 % , 56 % , 31 % , 19 % gdp per capita : - east : 110 % , 57 % , 48 % , 28 % - west : 98 % , 44 % , 29 % , 18 % higher for some decades ? 
  sure . 
  but if you are already so much behind by 1950 and the west kept growing faster initially and reached developed nation 's levels quickly , then it does n't really matter whether east grew faster or not . 
  it was still remarkably poorer . 
   because people ~ ~ have decided they will be better off without it . ~ ~ saw it was shit .

  shut up and bewbs or bum ?? 
  some of the best from estonia : - `` he , who digs a hole to trap another , will fall in it himself . '', 
  - `` measure seven times , cut once . '', 
  - `` make fun of the man , not of his hat . '', 
  - `` he , who brings up an old matter , will have his eye plucked out . '', 
  - `` a lie has short legs . '', 
  - `` where there 's smoke , there 's fire . '', 
  - `` the cone does not fall far from the tree . '', 
  - `` do n't rejoice before the evening . '', 
  - `` one does not look into the mouth of a horse given as a present . '', 
  i think in estonia * limonaad * is generally any `` non-black '' sparkling beverage . 
  any black sparkling beverage is called * koola * . 
  some famous brands like coca-cola , pepsi , fanta , sprite and [ kelluke ] ( http://www.ahoi.ee/components/com_shop/img_pictures/4740098016342.jpg ) are often named separately and calling them `` lemonade '' in some contexts can be rather weird . 
  plus in a sentence `` buy lemonade '' , the lemonade would most likely just stand for [ tartu lemonade ] ( http://www.viinarannasta.ee/images-shop/1333524405-tartulimonaad150_2012.jpg ) . 
  oh and kvas ( * [ kali ] ( http://g4.nh.ee/images/pix/520x520/ccfn6evjtdk/kaljatest-jook-kali-pudel-seltskond-66500812.jpg ) * ) is never lemonade . 
  different countries have many extra letters on the keyboard . 
  here 's the [ estonian keyboard ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9e/kb_estonian.svg/2000px-kb_estonian.svg.png ) for example . 
  middle easterners are a noticeable minority on the streets , while russians are mostly not . 
  and the reason one might think the russians are 100x worse is that their numbers in some countries are far higher , i.e. 
  they are a very big minority compared to middle easterners in most countries . 
  plus in latvia and estonia the russians are a relatively poor minority , who mostly live in poorer ghetto-like districts and towns in the sense that they live in a dense and poor urban area and rarely in the countryside . 
  different levels of municipalities and regions usually elect them amongst themselves . 
  from estonia 's six members , three are chosen by the association of estonian cities and three by the association of rural municipalities . 
  the decision to leave is very easy , but in practice to breach all legal ties , it 's very difficult . 
  yes , brits , better make the memories last !, 
  recently post-uni and i moved back to my home town and temporarily live with my parents again . 
  but during university , i mostly lived in 2-room apartments , which i shared with different friends . 
  i managed to live quite cheaply and lived on the local town hall square of my 100k student town for a ridiculous 165 $ per month per person + utilities .

  they are mostly from germanic languages and were adopted from the 2nd millennium bc to early 20th century ad . 
  we pronounce them the way estonians always pronounce loan words - by raping them as long as they are comfortable for our tongues . 
  some examples of germanic word roots can be found [ here ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/estonian_vocabulary ) . 
  different social groups , different name . 
  in university almost everyone started to call me by a nickname that is derived from my surname and i 'm rather used to it . 
  my family and my classmates still call me by my first name . 
  when i meet a person , i usually introduce myself by my first name , but ask them soon to switch over to my nickname . 
  no , it was not a joke , but an exaggeration . 
   we often do n't know if politicians are believers or not because no one care . 
  well it 's the same for us , although chances are they are not . 
   but , a big part of the muslim minority has turned from culturally muslim deists to devout religious . 
  same has happened with our russian minority . 
   now i see headscarf everywhere ( even at the university now ! ), 
  and we ( alledgelly sometimes , sometimes less ) hear and talk about islam and practices a lot . 
  yeah , seeing a frenchman in paris or strasbourg or nice turned out to be quite a challenge . . 
  where ? 
  what happened ? 
   ta ** l ** linn ftfy   is this something considered acceptable in estonia ?

    then i tried german ... she answered in german but she was n't too pleased either .

  sorry :( i did not mean bad . 
  i do n't think anyone really minds speaking german here . 
  the islands of estonia . 
  there are a few thousand of them and many are worth a visit . 
  they are n't all easily accessible , but 12 have regular connections with the mainland or other islands and the rest can be spectacular as well . 
  lack of religion , internet friendliness and the local culture in general . 
  that 's insane :o denmark , sweden , finland and estonia have the most card payments per person and estonia has the lowest average card payment sum , only 17 euros . 
  in the eu that is . 
  well separating ours into / r/eesti and / r/estonia would be ridiculous :d, 
  yeah , but saaremaa is n't a town , kuressaare is . 
  i ca n't see many people of the agriculture sector moving to kuressaare either . 
  around ? 
  perhaps , but people moving to a town like p\u00e4rnu are n't really looking for jobs in the agriculture sector . 
  i still do n't see what this has to do with agriculture . 
  women are indeed beautiful and the people in general tend to be rational . 
  probably not that common , most married people wear plain gold rings and some people do n't wear wedding rings at all out of comfort . 
  there are some jobs to be found in tartu as well , but not to this degree . 
  i just moved to tallinn from tartu because of that . 
  less farming ? 
  would and could are different things . 
  if it 's could and liked , then there is no such thing in estonia .

  you can get by with a card almost everywhere . 
  there are no respectable stores , restaurants or pubs , where you ca n't pay with a card . 
  why you do this ? 
  yeah , [ it 's not a requirement ] ( http://9gag.com/gag/adjyezj/estonia-s-weather-girl-is-hotter-than-mexico-s-weather-girl ), 
  relatively empty .

  basically there are : * `` slaves by choice '' , illegal working immigrats from very poor countries who would rather endure mistreatment than go back . 
  * women forced into prostitution and kept in line with drugs/violence . 
  * elderly/disabled people who are formally taken care of by someone who in reality collects their pension/disability benefits and treats them like shit . 
  dude , it 's the most produced jet fighter in the world and will remain in service for decades to come . 
  in reality , very few nations have more modern fighters , let alone in any significant numbers .

  not an insignificant number even by wwi standards . 
  the tank in the first pic is a british mark iv for sure . 
  the huge picture of the tower of gediminas might be pushing it .

  f16 * nobody is talking about the f22 , those are n't even for sale . 
   in an actual war they would be destroyed on the ground in the opening moments you could say the same about any target , though . 
  besides , we could do what the nordics do and operate them from mixed use airports , hoping * tactical enemy `` red '' * wo n't risk killing hundreds of foreign nationals . 
  what truly worries me , is the fact for the past 10 years , we 've been following the infamous 2 % guideline yet our bang for buck spending has been absolutely appalling . 
  everything done thus far has been predicated on the belief we can fully rely on our allies for everything and transforming our own military into a cushy auxiliary force . 
  i find such approach incredibly undignified and dangerous , because the simple truth is you can never truly rely on anyone and what is n't ours , is n't ours . 
  looks cool but i feel sorry for people whose houses are under it . 
  depends really on the state of the used f16 . 
  good to hear . 
  meanwhile here , we still get the `` we 're to poor to buy jets , so lets keep paying allies to patrol our skies and build bases etc '' , even though combined , the baltics have like twice the gdp of bulgaria .

  another very important reason for superior german aim was visibilty . 
  the brits had to spot the german ships in a fog against a gloomy sky , whereas the germans saw silhouettes of british ships against a clear horizon .

  most countries have more males among the young . 
  in here , the gap has grown to over 109 men for every 100 women among 25-29-year-olds ( the age when one often starts a family ) and it 's not doomsday yet , unless you happen to live in the rural regions . 
  sweden will probably cope but they might want to review their policy of taking in tens of thousands of `` teenage boys '' every year before it really gets out of hand . 
  it 's not tallinn without a rude russian security guard .

   although it is of course debatable whether the italians really ignored that the ship had changed owners , or instead rather purposely intended to weaken the new yugoslav navy as italy launched its adriatic land grab in the last days of wwi seeing how the rest of the former austro-hungarian navy was to be divided after the war , i find that unlikely . 
  besides , sinking one ship would n't have made that much of a difference . 
  if anything , it could 've angered the would-be yugoslavian allies .

   basic income makes it that alot of people will go from full time jobs to part time are you sure about that ? 
  today , most people who already have full time jobs welcome the chance to work overtime . 
  basic income or not , people always want more money and a chance to earn it . 
  this is not going to change , not unless such change will be forced upon and the normal working hours will cut shorter . 
  i could see basic income being implemented in a future society where more jobs have indeed been made redundant by machines but as of now , such society is still an utopia .

  second , most of them are uneducated because contrary to what mainstream media claims , syria is not a very educated country .

  the west had the luxury of not having russians fuck all their shit up for 50 years , nothing more . 
  occupational surnames are fairly common everywhere . 
  in todays america , an average miller or smith is very likely to be both british and german by decent as they 've all become rather mixed . 
  mind you , anglicization of one 's surname was n't something only the germans did . 
  non-anglophone immigrants would often do it just to fit in better or because the english-speakers would find their surnames difficult to pronounce and spell . 
  it 's just during the world wars , many germans did simply out of shame or fear of being associated with germany . 
  politically and militarily it 's still very much britain . 
  economically it 's indeed becoming more about germany as germany produces and exports a lot more goods than britain . 
   though german americans are the largest ethnic group in the us . 
  and perhaps even larger than estimated because germans `` arent cool '' like claiming irish or italian ancestry . 
  that 's because : * many of them arrived prior to german unification and lacked true common identity . 
  * world wars happened and it truly became unpopular to be german . 
  to a point many germans anglicized their names and thus m\u00fcllers became millers and schmidts became smiths . 
  given how much bad publicity this has brought denmark already , it is n't worth it .

  you are . lv that means `` lisa varvas '' in estonian . 
  it is translated as `` extra toe '' . 
  of course it 's not real . 
  most estonians knew that you have six toes even 40 years ago when internet was not yet so popular . 
  there was small ( but loud ) minority , who argued that latvians do have five toes , three in front and two in back . 
   * now as for the reason why military spending was so high , this was directly resultant of the reagan administration realising that socialism was catching up , and would win the cold war with enough time . 
  could you give some proof to that claim ? 
  did they really think that ? 
  they really had no idea what life was inside soviet union ? 
   the soviet economy was growing faster and more reliably than the us economy this is not true at all . 
  most of the growth was on paper . 
  and even on paper it was not that good . 
  there was enormous lack of even basic products and most of the products that existed were low quality . 
   in 1981 a plan was devised to use the much larger us economy to force the ussr into an arms race . 
  yes , star wars was one factor . 
  but not major factor . 
  corruption and falsification of production numbers was enormous problem . 
  also stealing . 
  seriously , i lived there . 
  i still remember . 
   faced with an arms race the ussr had to drive more and more of its economy towards the military , meaning that growth began to slow down , eventually the economy of the ussr began to implode . 
  collapse would have taken longer without arms race but the root problem with soviet union was much deeper then what can be blamed on four seasons and capitalistic imperialism ( yes , i remember ) . 
  it was totally rotten from inside and it was miracle that it did not crash earlier . 
  i think that 70s oil price peak had more to do with it . 
  that was what kept soviet union still going during 80s . 
  even top communists finally understood that it 's not sustainable . 
   but the amount of nazi propaganda that people are still regurgitating to this day makes me sick . 
  what ? 
  i hate nazis as much as i hate communists . 
  i just wish they all would have left us alone . 
  you really believe that ? 
  seriously ? 
  you are not comparing oranges with apples , what you do is more like comparing mother-ship to maple syrup . 
   let us consider your statement in the context of recently liberated afghanistan . 
  maybe a few years of occupation , with the occupying power building schools and hospitals , imposing our cultural values of secularism would have lead to a country which was better off . 
  instead as our troops withdrew , isis formed . 
  maybe . 
  but maybe ( more likely maybe ) it would have still formed . 
  maybe in afghanistan , maybe in syria , maybe in some other place . 
  there is root cause behind formation of isis and removing afghanistan from equation would not remove the root cause . 
   sometimes people forget that a war needs to be followed up by rebuilding . 
  yes there is always need for rebuilding . 
  how does it even connect with liberation ? 
  you are another one who thinks that we are literally incapable of doing anything without someone else help ? 
  do n't you think it 's bit racists ? 
  no , i do n't mean bit . 
  i mean its flat out idiotic racist statement so you would never make it about some other people , but as we speak about east-european barbarians here , then everything is ok , even blatant racism . 
   in the case of eastern europe , over 1700 towns and cities were completely levelled by the fighting , ok , i understand that part , even when it 's wrong  would it have been better for the poles to abandon them with nothing ? 
  but ... 
  i 'm sorry but i need translator here . 
  my english is not good enough . 
  what does this sentence mean ? 
  you may translate it directly to russian or just try to expand it in english . 
  currently it has no meaning for me . 
  you are actually racist enough to think that poles are incapable of restoring their own cities ? 
   the collapse of the eastern bloc happened under gorbachev when he stopped providing foreign aid nop . 
  it happened because bureaucracy combined with over 50 % of the gdp spent on military and party luxurious lifestyle was unsustainable .

  i 'm actually old enough and i actually lived there .

  if you bribe me with food and wine , i will join you . 
  i really hate war anyway . 
  ireland and malta . 
  yes i messed up . 
  i meant leave voters of course . 
  somehow i missed links from your last post . 
  i think it may be my new mobile . 
  i 'm still getting used to using reddit on phone and i missed your links . 
  yes it seems that racist acts are on rise in uk and yes pm confirmation is official enough . 
  that 's sad . 
  i still think that brits are not that bad . 
  there just ca n't be millions of racists no matter if they chose leave or remain . 
  racists are usually loud and obnoxious minority . 
  brits are not that different . 
  something that comes from official channel . 
  like police for example . 
  not random tweets . 
  its gone so crazy that some people label most remain voters as racists . 
  i have hard time believing that uk has millions of racists .

  well , if you consider cold war ussr and america , the inequality in us was obviously worse , but people in us were way better off . 
  slovenia has an insane minimum wage considering their gdp , ( probably one of the highest in the developed world in relation to their gdp per capita ? ) . 
  so my question is , how has it affected slovenia ? 
  cmon guys , stop playing around . 
  time to join romania ? 
   br\u00c5 has done multiple studies about ethnicity and sexual violence sauce pls ? 
  you seem to not understand how polls work . 
  they can usually only speak their native language and english , so this is probably the most important factor for wanting to get to britain . 
  uk also has higher salaries and is richer than most of main-land europe . 
  it just so happens , that most of what you 're saying portrays lithuania in a bad light ? 
  this is akin to saying that `` we have a problem , reindeer are going extinct , i know !, 
  we 'll import moose to replace them ! '', 
  reindeer will still go extinct , you 'll just have moose instead . 
  the problem we 're having is that people are forced to choose between having a decent standard of living or having children . 
  this should n't be the case , the state should take a more active role to support people having children , so they would n't have to choose between those two . 
   poland then stopped thinking of commonwealth since russians raised lithuanian fake nationalism on denying and destroying everything what is polish . 
  we stopped being freind only because of lithuania and they need to apologize . 
   lithuania and latvia were the most prosperous soviet republics before 1990 , their gdp per capita was almost double as russian ssr , many of russians were settled there and working , living . 
  after 1990 when those countries received independence there was huge economical decline and many of russians moved from there due to lack of job and prosperity . 
  economy started to grow from mid 90 's but it did n't stop the emigration . 
  in 2004 when those countries joined eu thousands emigrated to west europe . 
  also very low natural growth and quite old population does n't help . 
  population of those countries will futher decline . 
   wilno/lithuania is a cool topic to discuss . 
  because it seems that even lithuanians do n't know much about their country . 
  well years of soviet rule . 
  it 's a young nation anyway . 
  they must see their ups and downs , not always ups as they want to present now . 
  young nation needs to grow up a bit . 
  etc , sure thing buddy . 
  well , sorry if i take your anecdote with a grain of salt , since you seem to have some sort of a personal gripe against baltic countries . 
  yeah , i addressed this . 
  crime does n't only consist of murder and murders in estonia mostly are n't crime related . 
   extreme right wing party are they an `` extreme right wing party '' because of their stance on immigration ? 
  or why ? 
  there are many parties in eu that have similar stance toward immigration , but are n't called `` extreme right wing '' . 
  http://www.civitas.org.uk/crime/crime_stats_oecdjan2012.pdf lowest burglary rates in oecd , 3x lower as second last . 
  second lowest assaults in oecd . 
  fifth lowest car theft . 
  these are 2012 statistics , since then our murder rate has dropped 50 % and everything else as well . 
  the murders are almost exclusively old a-social drunks stabbing each other at apartment parties , a relic from the soviet era that will phase out as the older generation dies off . 
  nothing that really affects the general public . 
  most of the rest of the crime is concentrated in `` ida-virumaa '' which is a majority russian area . 
  overall , i 'd say most of estonia is one of the safest places in the world crime wise . 
  so yes , i would say estonia has low crime . 
  this is really bizarre , i had no idea there was much support for death penalty here . 
  especially considering how low crime is here . 
  i 'm hoping it 's a fluke . 
  just curious , are they considered `` center right '' or `` center left '' just because of their stance on immigration ? 
  overall norway feels like a very left-wing country . 
  or are there more things that differentiate the two ? 
   in more racist subs like r/sweden kek, 
   anyhow , it made me research stuff like the ecthr 's sanction system or the dublin regulations in detail , so i might have actually learned something . 
  how about a tl ; dr ? 
  there are two things in play here . 
  first of all , the chances of someone robbing a store with a gun in finland are minuscule , while in america they 're pretty high . 
  secondly , the thieves would 've gotten off pretty much scot-free in finland , because petty theft carries very small punishment in finland , but in us , they 'd land in jail if they did it repeatedly . 
  so taken that into consideration , i think she acted appropriately . 
  can someone explain why norway and sweden are going in such different directions in these matters ? 
  what ? 
  i mean i do n't really even care , but if a thing is made entirely in one country , entirely by the nationals of that country , entirely based on their ideas , then i consider it made in that country . 
  even though the money guys are from another country . 
  sure , but there are tons of countries with a lot of money . 
  there are n't tons of countries where people come up with ideas this good and are capable of realizing them . 
  programming was all done by estonians . 
  so in the end , it would be easier to replace uk in that equation , than to replace estonia . 
  it 's not exactly that bleak either , transferwise is still run by estonians who probably own a lot of the stock . 
  both created a lot of jobs in estonia , and the estonian coders got a lot of money off selling skype . 
  yes , uk is the only country in the world that has money . 
  you are right ... 
  it 's not only the idea , but also all the work to make it happen , capital came from elsewhere , but that 's hardly what really matters . 
  transferwise founders are both estonians , offices in tallinn , new york and london . 
  skype authors are both estonians . 
  these ideas were realized by estonians , who spent their life in estonia and had an estonian education . 
  so i think we deserve the most credit here . 
  they might have gotten the capital from other people and headquartered somewhere more convenient , but all the key work was done by estonians who live in estonia . 
  transferwise uk and skype sweden , both are more estonian than those . 
   which europe bombed europe did n't bomb anything , some european countries did . 
  the individual country pages have tons of information and tons of sources . 
  i think we should reject all asylum claims where the refugees either passed through safe areas or where they had a safe area closer and easier to get to than europe . 
  if we could remove all the economic migrants the refugee numbers would shrink to manageable numbers and i would n't be against accepting them . 
  also we could then direct more money to help out the large number of internally displaced refugees and refugees in countries next to the conflict zones , where the real refugees are . 
  the ones who ca n't spend thousands of euros to give to smugglers and do n't comprise of only young men . 
  prostitution is legal ( or to better put it , it is n't illegal , but it 's not a recognized occupation ) , but organized prostitution is illegal . 
  it is n't really publicly talked about , so i 'm guessing it 's not a huge issue here . 
  i think government ca n't do much differently , maybe crack down on underage prostitution more . 
  we definitely ca n't legalize it fully , since we do n't want sex tourism , maybe if scandinavia and the baltics all did it at once . 
  what stormfronters ? 
   you 're only in a position to be a net contributor because of how much eu has invested in the country in the past . 
  that 's not exactly true , estonia showed incredible growth even before joining eu , but of course it has helped , but that 's the point anyway , is n't it ? 
  you invest some development funds for a short while and you 'll be receiving back for a long while afterwards . 
  it 's an investment , and estonia has clearly paid off . 
   eu and nato are separate entities . 
  nato or no nato , we are still obligated to defend you , because an attack on estonia qualifies as a violation of eu territory . 
  you might expect that us will keep you safe , but the eu has to operate on the assumption that it will have to defend its own territory . 
  most eu countries are members of nato , so they 'd have to defend us with or without eu . 
   do n't you realize that you 're only a member because of people like me , who believed in a european project and supported constant eu expansion ? 
  it 's funny how you forget that now that you 've progressed economically and socially . 
  there were a lot of people opposed to the eastern expansion back in the day , and they had very , very good arguments -- the same kind of utilitarian arguments you 're using today . 
  i do n't .

  thank you , very interesting !, 
  it [ does n't mean that ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/welsh_independence ) , there are also one fifth of indifferent opinions . 
   a majority of wales voted to leave do you know some approximate estimations of eu referendum voting preferences and independence support for welsh-speaking people ? 
  so are we however this is just a name for a broader battle group i presume, 
  this is the nordic council , not the nordic countries in general . 
  no one in estonia claims we are a member of the nordic council . 
   although we have n't tried it , not even when russia was part of the ussr . 
  well , obviously it 's usually bigger v. smaller nation issue :d and you do `` try '' it as it is the form of your country right now and in the same time you force your will onto other nations both within and out of your country ...  it was not well-organized , but even if it had been , the outcome would 've been the same . 
  it was an imperialistic scam , quite similar to what one could see in the baltic states in 1940 . 
   independence movements and revolutions are practically always illegal , but their results and causes are facts on the ground . 
  well that indeed , however i 'm sure had there been no october revolution , then estonians would have opted for the democratic way out . 
   that 's what ukraine insists it should 've been , to `` let go '' . 
  because these people are not indigenous and do n't have that right . 
  especially if they claim they were doing something democratically ... you goes for russia of course , not you personally :d  the indigenous status of the crimean tatars can be disputed , but it is irrelevant . 
  but can it though , when did they come to crimea then ? 
  do you know what the word `` international '' means ? 
  most probably , yes . 
  just that i 'm from huge russian majority districts for all my life , so i 've never gotten used to them and have quite strong opinions on the subject . 
   no major outlets reported becasue it was a cover up well , to say quite like that is a bit of an overstatement as unreliable sources have been claiming events like that for a long time now and they quite often turn out to be complete lies . 
  exactly . 
  oh never mind , but i could sure have a til about nascar !, 
  no , i mean for the events in cologne . 
  i was not very active in this sub back then . 
  should have put / s as well , 
  of course not . 
  and it 's only perceived as a racial issue because people of a certain race mostly live in a certain geographical area and have the same culture ... 
  that 's what is happening throughout europe . 
  mainstream parties fail to see the problem and change their immigration policies , but these are often existential issues so people choose to vote for far-right or right-wing populist parties , whom most of them would n't otherwise agree with . 
  did they ? 
  yes . 
  because criminal status is the only thing that makes people do drugs . 
  if you criminalize tobacco or alcohol then you will have the opposite effect so that must prove it 's true . 
   workforce will be cheaper in this case , i assume . 
  lol , at least for half way :p, 
  wonder what 's tallink 's take on this . 
  i mean , should they already decide that it will be built , i can imagine tallink would want to invest in it in order not to lose its market share . 
  if you claim tallinn is madness , just spell it correctly the next time to have more credit . 
  especially after seeing the effects legalizing has had in the us . 
   its mostly the young people who either have mortgages and who have it though . 
  it 's also the young people , who are more willing to revolt against the dictator if things turn sour and his promises finally turn out to be empty . 
  lol , so if russia organizes a famine to kill the locals and deports the rest and replaces them with their own people , then they have the right to claim the right to self determination ? 
  yeah , sorry kid , that 's not a plausible solution . 
  and do n't start to lie about the crimean referendum being democratic . 
  russian empire was not democratic either ... and estonians on a large scale supported democratic-minded political parties , so you argument here is bogus . 
  and your argument is even insulting - the vote should n't be to `` let go '' , but to `` go '' . 
  the rightful indigenous people - the crimean tatars opposed independence and annexation to russia . 
  you helped crimea because you are an imperialistic dictatorship , just recognize it and we can finish this charade . 
  no because : - russians are not indigenous to the region ; - it was done undemocratically ; - it was done with russia 's orchestration . 
   at this point . 
  you finally got it . 
  perhaps you should call them with your ulterior knowledge and tell them that they can quit their ** cost analysis ** as it 's unnecessary . 
   unfortunately ... 
  it 's unfortunate we do n't have other tunnels to compare the construction , financing and maintenance to and have to do it all on our own . 
  ^ and ^ make ^ the ^ same ^ mistakes ^ others ^ did ... 
  channel tunnel was built already two decades ago . 
  construction is a lot cheaper by now and especially in near future thanks to new technologies . 
  and it would n't only be for investors , it would also be beneficial for the two governments to boost trade and connect tallinn and helsinki . 
  are you relatively sure about those savings ? 
  what 's the use for them after the ruble has dropped . 
  a mix of course , but with a high number of illegally mobilized estonian men . 
  i would n't speak in such absolute terms . 
  it may as well . 
  i mean , at least it 's not `` impossible in our lifetime '' because estonian and finnish leaders are actively considering it . 
  they are currently analyzing the costs , though of course they have n't decided whether they 'll do it or not . 
  difficult because these were soviet losses , which were held a secret and which the west barely cared about . 
  by the way , a lot of them were estonian illegally mobilized men . 
  yeah , it 's called the `` russian/soviet dunkirk '' and is considered to be one of the most deadly naval battles in history . 
  i found some passages to read [ here ] ( http://gallimafry.blogspot.com.ee/2013/02/12000-of-them-to-memory-of-drowned-1941.html ) . 
  lol , good one . 
  only about things that are shit , like the dictatorship , corruption , crime , history and imperialist stigmas . 
  yeah , there are very few estonians ( especially in northern estonia ) , who have n't been to finland . 
   kys deep stuff . 
  also in the baltic sea . 
  the ones i remember off the top of my head are : - [ soviet evacuation of tallinn ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/soviet_evacuation_of_tallinn ) with more than 12,000 military and mobilized dead - [ * moero * ] ( https://et.wikipedia.org/wiki/moero ) , sunk by soviets with 2,700 civilians dead - [ mv * wilhelm gustloff * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mv_wilhelm_gustloff ) , sunk by soviets with 9,300 civilians dead . 
  sort of weird to think that such a large battle had `` only '' 8,645 casualties , while several times during world war ii , thousands of people died on ships , which you barely hear about today . 
  [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynjstqufegk ), 
  oh , thank you , that danube river area example is a good way to refute such sentiments . 
  and by the way , only latvians and lithuanians are baltic people , estonians are finnic , 
  that will indeed save up a lot of time . 
  ca n't wait for the [ gulf of finland tunnel ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/helsinki_to_tallinn_tunnel ) though , 
  yeah , the `` baltic states '' in the modern sense in other countries includes only estonia , latvia and lithuania and for quite many estonians we find little connection to the term as estonians are not a baltic nation , but a finnic one , but i guess we do look similar on a map  i sort of get what you mean , but then again you do n't use such geographic terms for countries outside the former soviet sphere ... 
   family reunification is n't ( well , that i 'm aware of ) part of the refugee process , but rather part of normal immigration . 
  refugees are indeed not part of normal immigration . 
  i do n't have much problems when a legal resident in my country brings in his immediate family ( i.e. 
  not parents , but wife/husband and children ) . 
  but this should not be the case for refugees as it 's not a permanent status and normal family life is not the main goal of the status . 
  and i have nothing against people applying for citizenship when they are integrated well enough and that should also be the case for refugees . 
  however the line they draw between people , who are integrated , and the people , who are clearly not , is problematic . 
  some countries have huge districts for muslim foreigners , where they have sort of eaten out all the locals and even the police is afraid to enter there at most times . 
  these are not people , who have integrated well enough . 
  temporary of course could mean that that temporal time reaches past your own life . 
  sadly this is the state of things in many countries . 
  but as long as they do n't have citizenship - even after a regime change in their home country after 50 years - they should be sent back . 
  if you are able to purchase a house , then you can sell it of course should you get deported back . 
   how many years , how many decades , how many generations will you go before you say `` it just does n't make sense to deport '' ? 
  i do n't think it 's about years , but about level of integration . 
  we just had an albanian family in estonia , who had almost no reason to be here as albania is considered a democratic and safe country , but the daughters of the family spoke estonian without any accent , so they were all allowed to stay . 
  i really do n't get you . 
  if somebody invaded the netherlands today , do you think they would happily keep the 30 % colonists in that country after the occupation ended ? 
  i think you are naive as fuck in that context .

  you might forget that but this is * our * country . 
  i do n't care what migrants and conquerers that have come and gone over centuries think , want or like . 
  germans , poles , swedes , russians etc have come and gone , we 've stayed . 
  maybe russians see this as just some administrative regime of many over an arbitrary region , but for me , this is my free country . 
  my nation 's historical lands . 
  i 'm not going to debate about whether it 's the right or wrong one with foreigners . 
  in rome , do as the romans do . 
  in estonia , you do as estonians do . 
  both . 
  the first one is more important and is simply known as `` day of independence '' . 
  the second one ( from soviets ) was made a public holiday in 1998 , it 's called `` restoration of independence day '' . 
   is utter garbage . 
  `` they '' was not russian government , but 2 mps , they did n't `` argue '' that it was illegal , but said that they want to investigate if it was illegal . 
  and this investigation was shut down as '' lacking common sense '' almost immediately . 
  i 'm not arguing about russia not recognizing the independence of baltic states at all . 
  i 'm arguing about russia unilaterally interpreting baltic states as countries created in 1991 , not in 1918 . 
  basically saying that they are post-soviet creations . 
  i understand their logic behind it , as they are afraid of what could come out of recognizing occupation . 
  but we 're not willing here to change borders at this point , nor to ask any reparations . 
  we would ask some of those stolen artifacts back , though ( which hold no important value to russia ) . 
   almost the whole population of estonia and latvia are former soviet citizens . 
  there are not that many people left who were born before 1938 . 
  well , * de jure * , most of them were still estonian and latvian citizens , just under occupation . 
   your definition of migrant is rather strange . 
  people who were born and lived their whole live there could hardly be called migrants . 
  2nd , 3rd generation migrants ? 
  i mean , it makes no sense just arbitrarily stop calling or treating them such , if the only thing they achieved was geographically being on baltic territory . 
  integration is about language , culture , values etc. 
  furthermore , we do n't have * ius soli * here , so geographically being born somewhere means little to us . 
  besides , 2nd generation migrants often tend to radicalize more , an example being muslims in western europe . 
   what are you talking about ? 
  russia recognised baltic states and annexation of baltic states by ussr long time ago , stop imagining shit and then get offended by figments of your own imagination . 
   from [ here ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/state_continuity_of_the_baltic_states ) : the official position of russia is a continuation of the soviet position that estonia , latvia , and lithuania were not annexed by the soviet union but joined of their own accord in 1940 . 
  [ 8 ] russia insists that incorporation of the baltic states gained international de jure recognition by the agreements made in the yalta and potsdam conferences and by the helsinki accords . 
  [ 9 ] [ 10 ] they have also argued that in accordance to the internal soviet laws and constitution , restoration of independence was illegal and the baltic republics could only become newly created sovereign entities via the secession laws of the ussr . 
  [ 3 ] according to this position , all previous treaties , such as the treaty of tartu , [ 11 ] are invalidated , and all possible claims by baltic states for monetary compensation [ which ? ], 
  have no legal basis . 
  [ 9 ] [ 10 ] [ 12 ] this alternate thesis on continuity of the baltic states and its related consequences has fueled a fundamental confrontation between russia and the baltic states . 
  [ 13 ] [ 14 ]  lol what ? 
  it 's not russia who demands it . 
  russia just demands enforcement of un rules . 
  according to `` un convention relating to the status of stateless persons '' everyone has the right to a nationality . 
  it 's as simple as that . 
  it 's not ? 
  oh then there 's no problem i guess . 
  i do n't think estonia and latvia should be responsible for former soviet citizens . 
  in fact , russia should be the one , as it has declared itself successor state of ussr . 
   again , all un members have obligation to treat minorities fairly . 
  russia again just tries to convince latvia and estonia to follow international norms . 
  i 'm pretty sure it 's absolutely normal to demand official language from migrants in order for them to get citizenship . 
  even in `` multiethnic '' russia , you ca n't get one without knowing russian . 
  ancient egyptian artifacts ? 
  are you kidding me ? 
  that medal of president with estonian coat of arms is [ still in use ] ( http://assets.nst.com.my/images/articles/kersti_kaljulaid_1476112179.jpg ) . 
  that same medal is supposed to be worn by the president ( a copy was made because russia did n't return it ) . 
  russia itself , in addition , holds on to a bunch of objects it promised to return in the 1920 tartu peace treaty . 
  also common behaviour in the world ? 
  maybe in russian world ...  oh poor little estonian ... how unlucky for you to have a fellow countrymen who speak a different language ... / u/latvianlion summed it up . 
  if only it was the language and nothing else ...  respect like what ? 
  what russia is supposed to do so you would feel respected ? 
  for starters , recognize baltic states as they are , not some kind of post-soviet creations . 
  and no , i 'm not looking for occupation reparations or anything that in return . 
  and no , i 'm not wishing to argue about the lands russia annexed from estonia in 1945 . 
  stop demanding citizenship to soviet migrants ( russia is completely free to take them instead ) and whine about russian language ( again , a foreign language is not our problem ) . 
  just stop treating its neighbours like some kind of a former property . 
  this is yours and many other russian-speakers ' main problem in argumentation . 
  you attack others by saying they are the ones being insane , dumb , hysteric , russophobic etc and all that are friendlier to russia are sane , level-headed etc. 
  it does not make your argument stronger . 
  there are various reasons why finland is the way it is and baltics the way they are . 
  starting with finland not having to deal with soviet colonization aftermaths , russia not denying their birth in 1917 ( like it does with baltics , claiming they appeared only in 1990-1991 ) , russia not exploiting russian minority there ( which is , luckily for them , tiny ) etc. 
  it takes two to tango . 
  we do n't have any problem having good relations with russia . 
  but i 'd really like to see russia at least try to have some respect for its smaller neighbours ( invading them is definitely not that ) . 
  oh , and maybe return some stolen artifacts ? 
  i mean , soviets did ~ ~ kill ~ ~ liberate most of estonia 's political elite , but at the very least they could return the [ president 's medal ] ( http://p.ocdn.ee/40/i/000088/x-9deff9ad-76ab-4d08-867a-2b66884b20fc.jpg ) . 
  why the hell are such things kept in moscow ? 
  token of friendship russia-style ? 
  it 's not like putin would come anyway . 
  as far as i know , not a single high official from russia has visited baltics since collapse of ussr . 
  a tiny possibility , maybe lavrov doing a quick visit , would be if estonia and russia finally ratified the border treaty , but with ukraine crisis , this has stalled as well . 
  meanwhile , i do n't really love finland for its passive acceptance of russia 's actions . 
  i think it actually undermines eu unity that way . 
  wait till you see a finn coming with the constant `` but we have the longest border with russia '' to justify that . 
  i understand , i do n't blame them , but i do n't approve either . 
  meanwhile , estonia 's newly-elected [ president ] ( https://i0.wp.com/www.laanlane.ee/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/kaljulaid.png?fit=600%2c391 ) said in her interview she would not invite putin to estonia 's 100th anniversary in 2018 , if nothing would change about russia 's attitude . 
  kinda sums up the most contrasting aspect of our foreign policies . 
  too bad it 's wrong nowadays , at least when it comes to cable . 
  it 's slower and more expensive here . 
  fruits of not enough competition among telecom companies . 
  might that have to do with the fact that bologna 's metropolitan area has more than a million people , while tallinn 's stretches up to an `` amazing '' 0.5 million ? 
  i do n't think you can compare wealthy and very densely populated northern italy to estonia . 
  if you are looking for big city life , of course . 
  0.4 million ca n't compete with 5 million . 
  something about an american claiming a specific country to be basically a suburb of a specific city ? 
  there are like dozens of cities in europe that are larger population-wise than estonia . 
  that 's because they are citizens of estonia . 
  we are used to speak about ethnicity in estonia when we talk about nationality ( * rahvus * in estonian ) but many refer to citizenship in such case . 
   to simplify , if you have a passport issued by an eu country you have nothing to worry about . 
  i have n't even had a valid passport for nearly two years because i have n't travelled outside schengen and my id-card is enough for identification . 
  i imagine there are many others like me .
