  good guy spain . 
  i hope spain is not soon the only relatively sane large power left down there in the south . 
  preceded by `` muhammad ali is dead ! '', 
  whenever he * passed away * . 
  that is how he rolls . 
  fillon is not `` pro-russia '' like le pen is , right ? 
  as far as i can tell he 'd like to `` talk '' with russia and says the west is * partly * to blame for the crisis in ukraine , but surely this is not the same as being a kremlin puppet . 
  our president talks with putin and medvedev , does n't mean we are about to block the sanctions . 
  merkel `` talks '' with russia . 
  i get the feeling he 'll be in office for two weeks , go `` aww shucks guess we ca n't normalize relations after all '' and that 'll be that . 
  to put the cold war behind you ... and that would happen by letting russia achieve all of its geopolitical objectives . 
  then you would be in the situation in which the actual cold war existed to begin with and russia would have regained most of its lost strength . 
  tremendous !, 
  `` if we just let this expansionist neo-imperialist power have this one little country ... '' russia is not run by the kind of men that wish prosperity and friendship for all the peoples of the world out of the goodness of their hearts . 
  the usa is n't either , particularly starting on january 20th 2017 , but i do n't think the interests of the usa and russia are all that compatible . 
  now america could just completely retreat and go home , sure , but russia would use that to forge a global situation that would not favor america in the end . 
  yeah . 
  euronews was mentioned earlier , but it is as the eu itself , dull , boring , grey as dishwater , trying to do the right thing , nobody tunes into it . 
  it 's simply drowned out by louder voices . 
  now compare that to some of that russian stuff that is occasionally linked here . 
  the `` occupant '' video , all the `` infomercials '' about american crimes around the world . 
  they are basically entertainment mixed with political rhetoric mostly made of falsehoods . 
  the eu is sort of ( and admirably ) trying to fight a. ... 1950 's fight against a propaganda machine that mixes the best and worst of western entertainment and rather crude soviet-style crap . 
  the eu tries to appeal to reason and facts and fuck it we saw what happened with that this year , twice . 
  i hate to say it , but the eu needs to start appealing to emotions as much as logic . 
  mix the two . 
  you do n't even need to start printing lies , there is plenty to be passionate about in what the eu represents , especially after this year . 
  but color it up a little . 
  if the usa had no term limits i suspect bill clinton would be inaugurated for the seventh time in january . 
  what now , you piece of filth ? 
  while i remain rather worried about the putin/trump relationship too , it should be noted that trump has now been nominating some rather `` traditional republican '' figures to his administration . 
  general flynn , who attended the rt gala and sat next to putin , did become national security advisor , but if you look at for example mike pompeo , who trump nominated the director of the cia and everyone he is considering for secretary of state ( john bolton , rudy giuliani etc. 
  ) , he is certainly not just nominating people with straight up pro-russian figures . 
  as i understand bolton is the most likely choice right now and he just called putin a `` dictator '' last month ( outside of this conversation , bolton is otherwise kind of completely nuts though , too bad about that ) . 
  reince priebus became the white house chief of staff , he has very `` traditional '' gop views on russia . 
  paul ryan has no sympathy for the kremlin , mike pence called putin a `` menace '' last fall . 
  even the breitbart guy who got a top job blamed obama for being soft against russia a few years ago . 
  mitch mcconnell is very much pro-nato and remains the senate majority leader for the future . 
  we 'll see where this goes . 
  but seriously , google these people with `` russia '' after their name . 
  mutti invicta, 
  oh , only something like 1/6th . 
  but you only said `` border '' , nothing about how long . 
  russia and norway share a 200 km land border . 
  you are probably right about your first point , but nonetheless that is how many perceive it . 
  joining `` western europe '' ( which , indeed , is often presented as a thing that can be joined ) is often equated to joining the eu and/or nato in official contexts . 
  and we have a winner . 
  who does n't want to be a glorious northern viking , raiding fishing villages with swedes and norwegians ? 
  i mean , if you think `` eastern '' and think warsaw pact-style cold war country , then no , finland is not that . 
  geographically though , compared to most of europe , it absolutely is ( although technically belarus is in the middle of europe so i do n't know what to say here really ) . 
  then if by `` western '' you actually try to say eu + nato then again finland would be a western country but it gets a bit convoluted . 
  this is why i always say and think northern europe is the best category for finland , and the only one that truly works . 
  i am a little astonished and disturbed at how many places and people on the internet , very leftist and very passionate about politicians like sanders and corbyn ( whom i have no problem with ) , seem to use and refer to quite a bit of soviet imagery and music in their discussions . 
  like , yes , you want strong leftist politics right now , but are you entirely aware what this state was like ? 
  typically these are english-speaking sources , of course , from the uk and so on , so i can understand not being that well-versed . 
  still , sheesh . 
  https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b0/suomen-kansantasavalta.png/800px-suomen-kansantasavalta.png moscow proposed this exchange of territory ( i 'm sure i do n't need to explain the colors ) to finland along with other demands and when helsinki refused , after some time war broke out . 
  the green area is ... well , i 'm sure it 's nice nature , but there was no reason to agree to this . 
  what are the reasons given for the attack ? 
  i hear quite a bit of `` well the ussr attacked but only because finland did n't agree to nicely move the border further away from leningrad and accept russian karelia in return '' these days . 
  it is almost 100 % the same playbook . 
  western imperialists are behind everything and a secessionist `` democratic people 's republic '' with close ties to moscow pops up out of nowhere . 
  no , it was a russian `` scientist '' . 
  only a month to go baby !, 
  i 'm not sure i would . 
  it may just be a legend or exaggeration , but i 've heard florida is so warm you basically have bedbugs or other insects crawling around your house no matter how clean you keep it . 
  that is not something i would want to deal with . 
  the article is from may 4th 2016 . 
  scaparotti has been in his job for a year now . 
  well , the absolute vast majority of them do n't want that ... 
  i 've heard some weird second hand stories though . 
  i was making fun of thinking le pen has much of a chance . 
  27 percent is an insanely large gap to overcome in two weeks . 
  well , le pen was expected to win the first round quite comfortably not that long ago , and macron came out of nowhere , so it is surprising in that sense . 
  yeah , i remember when remain and hillary were leading by 27 percent nationally in aggregate polls . 
  damn , i already got hyped about macron vs. m\u00e9lenchon in the 2nd round and now this . 
  i have this thing where i expect people to know finland is not technically a scandinavian country , and whenever scandinavian countries are mentioned in a positive way i 'm mad if they 're not talking about finland . 
  but man , it 's so arbitrary . 
  i would n't mind classifying finland as scandinavian if the other og states are not opposed to it . 
  if the majority language was a germanic language i do n't know what the difference would be at all . 
  i loved the story about president xi telling trump that korea used to be part of china , at which point the president of the united states realized that ( east asian relations ) `` it 's really not so simple '' . 
  well , not only was korea not directly a part of china but also just the idea and the way he tells it makes my head spin . 
  not so simple . 
  that wording tells so much about this simple man . 
  i 'm not sure many think about it as `` omg ebil takeover imperialist dictator ! '', 
  i 'm sure it can be thought through more rationally . 
  but as you said yourself , crimea was an invasion plain and simple and just not the way this kind of thing should be done . 
  now , if you look at the reasoning for the annexation of crimea and the possibility of the same kind of thing being done elsewhere , i 'm not sure it 's exactly scaremongering . 
  even those constant articles about the baltics training for a potential invasion , they do n't think it 's absolutely going to happen , but best prepare just in case it does . 
  above all else , i too agree that friendly terms with russia would be beneficial , but three years after an invasion of another european state ? 
  the situation is in a complete gridlock for a reason and unless things radically change on a large scale they will remain so for a long while . 
  not a very sexy topic apparently , but very smart of the uk to try to address this now . 
  climate change will bring more migration northwards and the less disease they bring with them , the better . 
  if he sets his sights on central asia , he will extend that as far as he can without really alarming russia too much . 
  as soon as that happens he will go no further . 
  he is a complete paper tiger and only ultimately cares about consolidating his own power inside turkey , however he might try to do something to the region south of turkey . 
  erdogan will not go to war with russia over some silly neo-imperialist fantasy , admittedly he could try to subtly influence the states in question in cultural ways . 
  he is not going to openly attack anybody , much less russia , a nuclear state . 
  he 's just yapping about because that is all he can do . 
  i do n't know , deciding something like this and brexit with 51 % of the vote in favor and calling it a mandate seems kind of nuts to me .

  the reason why portugal became a troubled economy because it was on the brink of already becoming one before the real crisis started , and that was largely thanks to portuguese state again being unable to transform their economy . 
  lastly but not least , investors did n't pull money out of troubled countries , what they did was to stop investing into govermeant bonds , in essence they stopped to inject money to them . 
  of course one can say that this lead to these countries to become crisis countries , but from my point of view , these countries were already in crisis , external injections of capital to these countries made them to float for a while , nothing more nothing less . 
   they compete by having an economy of scale . 
  since bigger enterprises also means fewer enterprises , there 's less competition and they all have as their primary interest to generate profit ; lower prices are but one possible means to do so . 
  there are three overall competition strategies : cost leadership , quality and concentrating to a niche segment . 
  while companies seldom go as low as possible on their pricing , or their offerings of quality , they create constant market push to ever lower prices and ever higher quality . 
  and do remember that if prices are n't low enough or quality high enough , there is always opportunity for a new entrant coming into a market , good example of this is apple that entered and stormed the smartphone market . 
   they all have as their primary interest to generate profit ; and what is bad with this ? 
  profits always go somewhere , mostly to common people whose pension funds have been invested to multitude of stocks and assets . 
  and what is bad for example private investors getting profit for their capital ? 
  many people work and save up part of their paychecks to invest into stocks , thus injecting capital and valuations to the market . 
   the moralistic argument !, 
  counterexample : paris hilton . 
  actually ms. hilton has made her own fortunate , do remember that she was made disinherited by her grand father . 
  currently she is worth approx 30 million euros , largely earned from her tv-series and line of fragrances . 
   that , guns , ruthless exploitation and an expansionist culture . 
  that is actually not true . 
  most colonial possessions that western countries had were either loss makers or turned small profits , and even only handful of countries had any possession , namely uk , france , spain and portugal . 
  what made western countries rich as was ever continuing industrialization and development made possible by moving to a capitalist society driven by market economy . 
  if you have something to say it , say it , if you have something that you want me to read , then copy-paste it . 
  i 'm not going to waste my time trying to figure out what you want to say . 
   what he describes as plus in competitiveness triggers a downward spiral in wages , job security , pensions and taxes . 
  wages have pressure to go down in jobs that face increasing competition from developing countries , because if the wages wo n't go down , then the jobs will transfer to from example china . 
  this is part of the reason why portugal , spain and italy are in very deep trouble , and also why wages in germany have n't grown . 
  the only way wages can grow in europe is by increasing productivity . 
  in case of pensions and other social benefits , the thing is that european states have for a very long time engaged into ponzi scheme and what is currently happening due to smaller generations and declining fertility is outbreak of the whole bubble . 
  the only way pensions can be guaranteed for future generations is by cutting them from current pensioners , that never did actually contribute enough for their pensions , and cut also future pensions . 
   it puts the employees at the mercy of their employers as they get not enough paid to safe a little and gain security by that while the employment law is changed more and more to their disadvantage . 
  if a society wants to cover its citizens/residents then the only way to achieve it is to offer common social safety net , however that can be only made possible by people willing to pay for it . 
  it is totally wrong way to make companies to offer this by having rigid and expensive labor laws , first of all it does n't cover everybody , and secondly it will slowdown european companies so much that their international rivals will sooner or later outmatch and outgun them , making sure that in the future there will be less companies in europe offering employment , not more . 
       they have economy of scale , but why do you assume they use that to serve their customers rather than themselves ? 
  indeed , why do you assume that the market , as it is , is able to defend the interests of everyone in the best possible way ? 
  competition . 
  if you price your products/services too high , or you offer sub par quality , as in quality perceived/defined by consumer , you open up a opportunity for competitors to snap up customers from you . 
  in case of defending interests of everybody , no , that is not the point , markets reward those who are the most innovative and productive and those who ca n't match that , will be punished by the market . 
  that is the natural market evolution that has made the western countries one of the most richest countries ever seen in the face of the earth . 
   two posts up i say `` i 'd take a street full of small , independent , caf\u00e9s above a street of chain caf\u00e9s any day of the week . 
  '' , so i do n't know where you get that idea . 
  well , to be honest i do : everyone who does n't believe in the market gospel unconditionally must be a supporter of dictators , right ? 
  essentially yes , because there is only a small step from saying `` we know best how these things needs to work and we will force our way '' . 
  markets themselves are democratic , everybody can try and anybody can fail . 
   no , it 's because those small caf\u00e9s do n't work for growth for the sake of growth . 
  the market favors the most efficient capital concentrating mechanic , nothing else . 
  the market favors those who offer what the market wants . 
  some part of the market wants it cheap , some part wants it quick , some part wants it big , and some favor quality . 
  the truth is that big chain can leverage scale of economies in all their actions , thus being able to produce more efficiently but important than that offer what the markets want to . 
   you can hardly say that the opinion of the population matters for the market when they use advertising etc. 
  so sway it to suit their business plan . 
  you seem like a kind a person who would favour that there is only one peoples coffee chain that serve only the one peoples coffee . 
  you might want to sometimes check what people who lived in the soviet union liked their freedom of consumption . 
  i find your lack of reading comprehension insulting . 
  * or how hard is to * ** hide the truth ** * :-d * you know , emphasis on hide the truth . 
  people can hide the truth if they so choose to , much less harmful than beating people like said in the article . 
  that is one option to deal with it . 
  i never said that is my opinion or that i would use it , just gave an example . 
   and starbucks business model is to buy other caf\u00e9s and shut them down . 
  that 's not fair play . 
  if the owners of other cafes want to sell , then i do n't see nothing wrong in here . 
  that is totally fair play . 
   i 'd take a street full of small , independent , caf\u00e9s above a street of chain caf\u00e9s any day of the week . 
  and the reason why small independent cafes have gone bust is because they have n't efficient , have n't had products and services that markets have wanted and that is why a big chain has been able to out compete them in price and in quality . 
  the market has spoken . 
  the problem in here is n't starbucks , but a ) the greek state that is incompetent to legislate and monitor laws it has enacted , and b ) greek cafes that could n't offer what the market wanted : hence people transferring their business to starbucks . 
   i really do n't care to argue regarding the free market philosophy , but the mere reality is that small businesses tend to be owned by people from the lower classes who have been hit the hardest from the crisis already . 
  if you want to create safety nets for people , you do this by creating comprehensive social security safety nets , not by creating patch work of protections that help some , but let many slip past it . 
  this is unfair and worst of all , hinders the functioning of the market . 
   your argument that the gov should let all small businesses die out ( with no regard over how that will affect the lower class and unemployment ) does n't make sense . 
  with this current economy , the space that will be created by them will not be replaced by the bigger corporations because they do n't have the funds or the will to risk such a move . 
  if those small businesses die because they do n't have enough business , then the only correct thing to them do is to go out of business . 
  eventually those freed spaces will be taken into other more productive use . 
  not to mention that legislation that allows shops to be open more does n't require them to be open . 
  that is for the shops to decide . 
  if to some shops it is n't economically sensible to be open , then they are not . 
  however if some shopkeeper invents and organizes a way to be open and earn more profits from being open more , then that business is rewarded by the market and will have more resources to either benefit owners or allow expansion . 
   this is not a matter of debate , but rather of reality . 
  small businesses are shutting down everywhere in greece , but they are not replaced by bigger businesses . 
  this results in a very surreal image of locks and empty showcases everywhere in the centres of the bigger cities . 
  again , where there ever actual market for these ? 
  government should n't protect unprofitable businesses from market reality . 
  the big problem in european economies is that there is not enough businesses that are fast growing . 
  in the us there are lots of businesses that start and many that will die , but there are always fee that have hit the golden spot and will grow fast and become huge multinational corporations . 
  for example how is it possible that the biggest cafe corporation is american starbucks ? 
  why an american corporation could grow fast and become multinational , but multitude of french , italian , spanish , greek , etc. . . cafe shops have stayed small and not grown fast ? 
  that is the real problem and i have foreboding that it has all to do with protecting small businesses . 
  government should n't protect small businesses , that distorts the market and does n't allow greater economies of scale to be born out from operating bigger corporations , thus leading the whole economy to produce less and work less efficiently than it would under other conditions . 
  allowing shops to be open more allows them more flexibility to optimize their operations as items are flowing off the shelf 's on more days and on more times : less items going wasted , more steady output of items , etc. . . 
  it also allows customers to me be more flexible on their shopping , for example become just-in-time shoppers . 
  i myself for example always buy groceries everyday that i need , which eliminates wasted food items quite remarkably . 
  another thing to add from the point of view of employment is that extended opening days and hours will lead to stores hiring more people who are flexible and can work on those extended times . 
  in finland this has basically lead to hiring of more students and immigrants to handle extended hours : they are cheaper and more happier to work off-hours , for them the pay is much more worth it than for example to adult who has an family to feed . 
  or how hard is to hide the truth :-d ... `` these are just some funny people , they are weird , but funny , that is why they do this '' ... and if you get some followup questions or `` daddy , i want to be funny too '' then just ask would he be willing to trade his toy cars for dolls ... :-d but yeah , it is a very poor excuse on not being to able explain it to his son . 
   ` better answer is to abandon euro . 
  currency valuations can settle the issues and fix economic differences . 
  that is not really an answer , because single currency is requirement for single market to work in long term . 
  if you break up the euro , things will eventually fall into a position where individual member states prop up their failing export industries with competitive devaluations and other fiscal incentives so much that it breaks up the whole single market , and then you can say good bye to the whole european project and any idea that there would be any prosperity left in this continent . 
  if this continent wants to stay prosperous and fare well against competition coming from the us , china and other developing economies , then we need to integrate the economy more . 
  this can happen by letting the markets work , and let failing regions fail , or by moving competencies from regions/countries to federal level until things are solved . 
   i do n't really see any way to prevent this problem from reoccurring without disbanding the capitalist system completely . 
  if you want to describe the problem in an abstract way , here 's what happened : the financial system , in its effort to turn surpluses into bigger and bigger profits started making bigger and bigger bets , on increasingly risky ventures .

  any laws which include the word `` realm '' are less than funny . 
  ( the state of defense law does however mention that anyone 's basic human rights `` should not be violated more than necessary '' . 
  president gets the call to declare state of defense , the parliament has a veto . ), 
  noteworthy that [ general h\u00e4gglund ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gustav_h%c3%a4gglund ) is a second-generation general officer . 
  ( his father was a general in wwii . ), 
  more or less early picked to the fast track . 
  large reforms of the military during his time as the chief of defense made him a kind of a minor celebrity . 
  has a history of less than diplomatic statements . 
  ( imagine an ultrademocratic , low-budget version of prince philip . 
  of course , being retired , he does n't get as much attention than the royals do in britain . ), 
  seriously ? 
  nowadays , most militaries are no longer issued ridiculously pompous ceremonial uniforms . 
  so , camo is all they 've got for uniform . 
  the function of the high visibility vest is to allow other people using the road to see them well . 
  these days , it is not very fashionable to have casualties during peacetime exercise maneuvers . 
  well , the communist party pravda apparently has a circulation of 100k or so still . 
  and then there 's komsomolskaya pravda ( former youth version ) that transformed itself into a tabloid and has a circulation of 660k . 
  probably would need to rip open a lot more than piping to get every place with moisture to dry . 
  more or less only if you have mountains and dammed rivers . 
  when you have a surplus of solar or wind , either reduce hydro power production or even pump upstream . 
  then use hydro power to compensate . 
  i understand the norwegians already do this : when the danes have surplus wind power , they sell it really cheap to norwegians . 
  who then sell it back when it is n't suitably windy in denmark . 
  there may also be possibilities with smaller scale `` smart grids '' and local storage and production ( suggestions include using electric car batteries and other smaller-scale local storage for extra power , and use the same sources in case of threat of brownouts ) . 
  yes , a small professional army will do well in a small-scale conflict . 
  and for larger and richer countries ( in europe france and germany ) , that relatively small army can be well-equipped . 
  same goes for russia : their troops on crimea are no doubt from the professional part of their army , and well-equipped . 
  if they 'd somehow need to throw around the reserves , then we 'd start seeing older hardware . 
  even if russia has a backwards image in the west , they have a lot of natural resources and it 's a damn big country . 
  the war in georgia tells us one thing : proper anti-air can humiliate a numerically superior force . 
  on the ground , though , it does n't matter if the invading tanks are t55s or t72s , if there 's nothing but land rovers on the other side . 
  not sure about the state of georgian at weapons , but i 'd assume that with little opposing armour , the role of a tank would be fire support and the rest of the job would be left for infantry to be done the traditional way . 
  noteworthy that special olympics and paralympics are entirely different events . 
  not sure about winter sports , but in my own sport , there 's a few paralympic athletes that could give a proverbial bloody nose to a lot of healthy `` athletes '' . 
  though yes , this still does give a kind of a signal that russia considers people who are physically handicapped to be classified into the `` cripples and other undesirables '' category . 
  i 'd guessed that sweden , too , has highways that can be prepared to be used as landing strips . 
  ( finland has , what , three regular air bases - if the air force would mobilize , fighters would be spread all over . ), 
  sure , russia has a lot of stuff , and they are modernising their grear , but it is n't all top of the line , either . 
  not like most european armies would n't be boy scout associations with guns . 
  much more economical than maintaining world police . 
  not being tested in an actual shooting war , hard to say how a modern conscript defense force ( of a democratic country ) would fare against professional armed forces . 
  this seems to be somewhat common . 
  after all , ( quite ) some time ago time had [ the map mentioned here ] ( http://www.finnbay.com/f-time-magazine-returns-the-carelian-province-and-lake-laatokka-to-finland/ ) . 
  germany * might * be okay , but poland and lithuania have apparently split kaliningrad oblast . 
  similarly , ukraine and russia seem to have split belarus . 
  half of estonia is marked as russia , but in the return finland has expanded to pre-wwii borders . 
  apcs are n't tanks , but i ca n't deny that putin 's resorting to diplomatic measures . 
  that is , the kind of diplomacy the civilized world knew of 150 years ago . 
  looking at wikipedia , [ these ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:ukraine_cencus_2001_ukrainian.svg ) [ two ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:ukraine_cencus_2001_russian.svg ) maps about language distribution in ukraine are probably meaningful . 
  do note that in the russian language map the colouring is slightly misleading , as white marks less than ten percent native speakers . 
  the kherson region just north of crimea has almost 3/4 native ukranian speakers . 
  ( of course , native language probably does not map 1:1 on political opinion . ), 
  local ( finnish ) media seems to be drumming up the military exercise near by , along with headlines like `` fighter jets are ready in the air '' . 
  personally , probably just pressure . 
  and russia still has a naval base in crimea , which adds some spice to the situation . 
  distantly related , apparently last night there was some kind of a fight between crimean russians and tatars . 
  independence day parade , and fdf flag day / marshal mannerheim 's birthday parade . 
  and then , for towns near garrisons , the day when conscripts pass basic training and take their oaths . 
  some bigger places have it in the base , but smaller bases like to travel to some nearby town and hold the parade there . 
  though those are mostly people , of course , and less about the military hardware . 
  i used to live near the local `` campus '' of the military college , as evident of the road signs `` watch out for armored vehicles '' . 
  truth , the first thing to die in a conflict . 
  the article lacks details , but i 'd assume that collectors can get licenses for more weapons . 
  iirc , a little bit to the east ( i.e. 
  finland ) it should be possible to get a license to own operational fully automatic and other military weapons as an long-time collector . 
  however , the more potentially dangerous stuff you own , the more there 's paperwork , and the storage is an issue . 
  ( essentially requiring a vault or something equivalent in your house . ), 
  and then there are issues with some collector weapons being deactivated , but possibly repairable to original condition ( as `` weapon parts '' were mentioned ) . 
  grenades would probably be the biggest issue , though it was not mentioned whether those were hand grenades or artillery grenades ( not sure if swedish makes a distiction ? ), 
  not very long time ago a `` collector '' managed to get killed in finland ( ~ ~ i think oulu/ule \u00e5borg ~ ~ kemi ) while trying to deactivate ( ? ), 
  a wwii era artillery round he had found from the wilderness . 
  [ police surrounded the place and called the military in . 
  ] ( http://yle.fi/uutiset/police_uncover_heavy_arms_cache_in_kemi_following_deadly_blast/6831514 ) so , if there 's weapons that were licensed in a given state of repair that have been modified to be `` more functional '' , or there are weapons or explosives that have been improperly stored , or there are unlicensed weapons or explosives , then the licenses are probably going to be revoked . 
  i am * not * a gun law expert , nor i do know anything about swedish law , though . 
  e : spelling/syntax, 
  expanding : saab originally stood for `` svenska aeroplan aktiebolag '' or `` swedish aeroplane ltd. '', 
  funny anecdote from mid-forties : finns had broken soviet diplomatic codes , and as part of [ operation stella polaris ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/operation_stella_polaris ) the codes were sold to west . 
  allegedly , truman ordered the codes to be returned to the soviets . 
  oss copied some of them , and to their amazement , noticed that the soviets continued to use the codes that they by now knew to be broken . 
  the gini index for finland ( pg . 
  39 ) is the lowest - i.e. 
  the income is rather equally distributed . 
  the other side of the wealth coin , i.e. 
  assets , probably are n't as equally distributed ( there 's been some talk about having a possible class divide between people who are renting their apartments and people who can afford to own their homes ) . 
  on table 7 ( pg . 
  41 ) i seem to read that as far as the distribution of assets go , finland is pretty mediocre within the compared set of countries . 
  ( by no means a representative set . ), 
  if we can trust wikipedia , [ this list ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_distribution_of_wealth ) would seem to indicate that finland is the 9th most equal country in the world if distribution of wealth is considered . 
  ( [ the equivalent list for income ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_income_equality ) seems to be a bit incomplete . ), 
  i do n't see guns on their turrets . 
  it would be logical to assume that these were command post or signaling vehicles designed to support the artillery . 
  there 's only a few of those there . 
  * probably * fire control or command post vehicles , not ifvs . 
  well , we 'll see if the ep can get its will thru . 
  of course , we could see a power struggle between the parliament and the council ( which would ominuously remind of the issues with senate/congress in the united states ) , but i do n't think it would be very likely . 
  especially when a single party ca n't probably get an absolute majority in either . 
  the voting system must be proportional , i 've understood . 
  most will probably use [ d'hondt ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/d%27hondt_method ) , though some use single transferable vote ( northern ireland and ireland at least ) . 
  the votes in d'hondt can be personal ( candidates within party list ordered by popularity , most popular selected proportionally ) or to a party ( predesignated selection order of candidates within the list ) . 
  a group of finns from the backwoods go to have a holiday in italy .

  tax the shit out of fast food and fattening foods and drinks . 
  put in place incentives and otherwise promote healthier foods . 
  teach healthy eating in schools ( not very effective immediately , but i think it ingrains the idea in people 's minds ) . 
  campaigns about the health concerns of obesity . 
  i know that those are n't things that you can implement willy nilly and have no unseen consequences . 
  just some things that come in mind . 
  i wonder what countries with healthier citizens have done right . 
  i guess it could be both , but trying to prevent moonshine business seems completely valid reason alone . 
  after all , it 's a big problem in russia . 
   illuminati-zion-symbol i knew it . 
  better report to / r/european and / r/conspiracy . 
  this is the evidence we have been waiting for . 
  `` hey y' all people in the us , i recently found out about my heritage and i would to know more about it !, 
  i 'm 1/32 american and i 'm planning on visiting the us one day !, 
  as an american-irish , what are some things i should know about and what cities should i visit ? 
  also , why does n't the us do things like the irish do ? 
  i like hamburgers and nasa and i rooted for you in the olympics !, 
  bye y' all ! '', 
  you see this ( in reverse ) so goddamn often . 
  probably the point where people rise up and start fighting immigration with guns . 
  i 'm having hard time seeing that happen , since most europeans are n't behind these terrorists and their beliefs . 
  sounds more like a racist dream . 
  this sadly seems the case . 
  a lot of apologists in here . 
  and people more or less justifying this . 
  `` well what do you expect with immigration rates this high ? '', 
  it 's now 87 % , which seems lower than bad news about muslims . 
  usually news about the police catching terrorists are higher . 
  racists vs. the rest ? 
  check out / r/european . 
  it 's awful . 
  i 'm not trying to defend fifa here , nothing like that ( seriously , fuck them ) , but do we have any proof ? 
  i know the general feeling is that they 're corrupt as fuck and it really * seems * like that , but has anything proving that they are or that they took bribes in this case surfaced ? 
  i too think that they took bribes , but i 'm just interested if there 's some proof of it . 
  kinda sad if after all the previous arrests , talk about slavery and whatnot , what opens our eyes is westerners getting arrested . 
  i do n't think most people in either place wants that . 
  i know i sure as hell do n't . 
   easy as that right . 
  easy as that . 
  this is a surprisingly dumb and childish comment , even for this sub . 
  probably even harder when i was n't really arguing with the last comment , rather joking about how `` do n't hate the players , hate the game '' is such a realpolitik thing and russia is famous for its realpolitik . 
  that 's such a realpolitik thing to say that i have no doubt that russians of all people are aware of it . 
  i can actually see this in their official statement when the next bomber of theirs flies close to sovereign airspace . 
   nato is a defensive pact . 
  i 'd say you 're going to have hard time convincing the russians ( among others ) of this , though . 
  especially with nato creeping closer and closer to russia , country by country encircling them . 
  ( though ca n't really blame the countries neighboring russia for seeking nato protection . ), 
  the west is a lot more subtle with their propaganda . 
  i 'd say it 's more about what 's not told , unlike with russia , where it 's about the ( often falsified ) news being told . 
   well , clearly the nato has been no threat to russia . 
  i do n't really agree . 
  nato has probably not been as threatening towards russia as russia has been towards nato , but russia and nato are pretty much mortal enemies . 
  ( though there was a short time of warmer relations , as you pointed out . ), 
  it would probably be better to say that nato is * threatening * for russians , instead of being a real threat . 
  i 'm cautious because russians `` know '' that it 's the west doing shit in ukraine and not them . 
  and we `` know '' the opposite . 
  i have no doubt that the west ~ ~ is n't ~ ~ is more in the right here , but makes you wonder what we really `` know '' . 
  e : `` is n't '' to `` is '' . 
  whoops . 
  i was n't calling this case propaganda . 
  ( i did read the other comments before commenting . ), 
  it was more of a general , hangover-y pondering . 
  i have no doubt there is * some * propaganda out there , which we believe . 
  rather than calling this propaganda , i was wondering what that propaganda we believe and they in russia/outside of the west `` know '' is n't true is . 
  it 's a cool city to visit . 
  i would definitely recommend . 
  you 'd think he would n't have to jump through loops to make nato look like russia 's enemy . 
  makes me wonder what might the western propaganda that we believe be . 
  surely it must be something subtle like this . 
  the whole thing is ridiculous . 
  no one is forcing them to spend their money on military instead of social programs . 
  and they certainly are n't stationing troops in europe for selfless reasons . 
  and they did n't loan western europe money out of the good was of their hearts . 
  the whole excuse about us `` holding them back '' is just ridiculous . 
  also , i know it 's a common mistake , but finland is n't actually a part of scandinavia . 
  finland is a nordic country , but not a scandinavian one . 
  it 's a big and vague group in the sense that there 's all kinds of anarchists , from left and right , even though leftist anarchists are more common . 
  if you ask ( some ) americans , they ca n't be `` socialist '' like us with free healthcare and whatnot because they 're paying so much for our defence . 
  and some even say that they 're pretty much doing it because freedom and democracy . 
  ( also , `` we saved your asses in ww2 ! '' ), 
  as a finn , it 's kinda puzzling . 
  we are n't in the nato . 
  and we kinda fought in the axis side . 
  thank you for your service , i guess ... 
  that / r/polandball stuff is n't the best for trying to make a serious point . 
  smash asem was at least portrayed as such . 
  yeah , that 's just fucked up and barbaric . 
  waiting for a comment from varusteleka . 
  no , it would n't . 
  it would most likely escalate things and cause these groups to be more popular . 
  their message would certainly be more popular when they could show how the police is using excessive force against them . 
  thinking that violence would solve this is just naive and even dangerous . 
  these guys seems to be leftists , but that does n't mean all anarchists are . 
  there are rightist anarchist groups too . 
  anarchists come from left and right . 
  it 's a pretty big and vague group . 
  what was the idiotic part ? 
  are n't they just saying that they are n't a single organization but rather an umbrella organization for groups that oppose this expo ? 
  he is n't wrong . 
  people * would * notice your linux group , after something like that .

  all in all the easiest way to get to someones facebook is to ask facebook to let you in . 
  they might do it if you are cia and ask nicely . 
  how exactly do they get the passwords easily ? 
  maybe having shitloads of random sex causes both abortions and single parents ? 
  that is not what populism means . 
  this . 
  this is why the finns party in finland is populist but the greens are not . 
  `` the people knows best '' was basically their slogan for years ( even though their popularity was constantly at 5 % ) . 
  something some people use instead of coffee . 
  in 1809 sweden lost their balls . 
  after that they changed from conquering warlords to whiny hippies . 
  i take it you never need to carry anything but yourself ? 
  in finland it 's basically any reason that is not entirely stupid . 
  i went trough the links . 
  many of them have absolutely nothing to do with the issue . 
  some of them do . 
  however i would like you to consider that there are thousands of universities and tens of millions of students . 
  you can always find bad decisions and mistakes from a population that large . 
  show me how that becomes mainstream and you have some kind of a point . 
  in general i suggest you to not to vocally criticize something you know absolutely nothing about . 
  it does not make you look smart . 
  territorial waters are defined by a convention spain has signed . 
  there is nothing unclear in it . 
  if spain wanted an exception for gibraltar they should have added it . 
  well actually the international law is very clear and the dispute made up . 
  unless explicitly otherwise agreed any territory can claim 12 miles of territorial waters . 
  that is the international law . 
  and that same convention actually states that no exceptions can be made unless they are explicitly permitted by other articles of the convention . 
  gibraltar settles for 3 miles . 
  spain maintains that because a treaty written 300 years ago does not mention waters gibraltar does not have territorial waters but 1 . few treaties mention sea areas and 2 . the entire point is against an international law spain has signed that clearly disallows exceptions . 
  regarding the land there is no actual dispute . 
  spain ceded the land in perpetuity . 
  it has already been british longer than it ever was spanish and any un decolonization agreements are conditional to the will of the people living there . 
   much better than a plumber would be paid i 'm pretty sure . 
  i 'm pretty sure a decent plumber gets more . 
   something interesting and meaningful that will also help you get a career in the field you are interested in . 
  gender studies does not help you at that . 
  like pretty much everyone has already said , it is not the job of a university to produce career choices or train you for any other career than a research one . 
  nor do they usually . 
  they teach skills that are important in some careers but often in a very general way . 
  which is why most with a higher degree do not really work with what they studied . 
  instead they often work in jobs requiring ability to learn and process information . 
  i do n't think you have ever attended a gender studies course . 
  or even met anyone who has . 
  but you clearly have an agenda . 
  trust me , most of us go to uni for reasons not related to money . 
  i have a masters degree in computational engineering and now i 'm starting a research job in neuroscience . 
  do you think they pay well to a phd student ? 
  do you think i would not get at least double the money in some tech company ? 
  i went to university because i wanted to do something interesting and meaningful . 
  gender studies can easily be that . 
  and only bad universities are businesses . 
  even in america . 
  the primary task of a university is to create knowledge not be a diploma factory . 
  well without a degree you can make shitty robots and reinvent the wheel ( i have a degree in engineering , i know what i am talking about ... ) . 
  i mean it does not require a degree to program an arduino to control a bunch of servos etc. 
  without a degree you can also be a shitty teacher . 
  for instance i would be a shitty primary school teacher . 
  most jobs do n't actually require too much education to make a minimum viable performance . 
  edit : you know good teachers invent new ways of teaching and adapt their methods to best suit the children . 
  low skilled ? 
  what kind of teachers do you have ? 
  in here they are required to have masters degree in teaching and it is actually one of the hardest programs to get into in universities . 
  sometimes people tend to forget that the stupid rock has already been british longer than it ever was spanish . 
  latin would actually be cool . 
  no , it 's usually in the front . 
  that is some awesomely stupid place to build a house . 
  why ? 
  we have balls . 
  i think if i have understood correctly all of those except interstate infra are mostly state level business unless the constitution is violated . 
  of course there are broad federal guidelines on things like environmental protection but that is also true for current eu . 
  how do you define most in this case ? 
  the states have all the powers not explicitly stated they do n't have . 
  which basically means everything except foreign policy , most of the monetary policy , and military . 
  they share some of that with the federal government in the sense that federal laws also affect the states but the same is already true in europe . 
  the big difference to eu is that in the us the federal government can collect taxes directly . 
  russia is big but their economy is not that big . 
  in the usa the states are very independent but give a part of their sovereignty to a higher level . 
  a federal government in eu would not really need to do much more than handle foreign and military policy . 
  the current eu can already issue directives that the member states must follow . 
  luckily reddit is not an institution able to force anything top-down . 
  instead a subreddit for the idea is exactly where down-up starts . 
  they have a couple of hours ferry trip to stockholm so they go there to study and be creative . 
  i do not see your `` fairness '' . 
  citizenship of a country is not a human right . 
  why should the location of birth have anything to do with this ? 
  why not just say everyone is german because that would be fair to all ? 
  i do n't want to live in a country that just has to accept anyone as citizen . 
  i want to live in a functioning society rather than one that follows your weird ideals . 
  even if that causes bigger legal and societal problems ? 
  i dont think they care if you come from china or uganda . 
  what matters is if you are legal citizen of the country ( or permanent resident for long enough ) . 
  if you are your children will be too . 
  and the children will get treated the same as everyone else . 
  at least in here they do , not sure about germany . 
  their legal status is just different until they apply for nationalization . 
  they still get the same healthcare and education and everything . 
  like i said the problem is that it is really hard to get rid of problematic immigrants if their children are citizens . 
  think of a situation where the parents are affiliated with terrorist groups . 
  what will you do ?

  and i am not saying this in an edgy `` thanks for the oppression bitches , our horrible revenge will be never learning your language '' - way the guy thinks we are doing it ( whoever he is , his knowledge in this particular subject is zero and i call bullshit on his `` stories '' ) but the fact that it really is . 
  you are never going to need it and when you interact with swedes , you just speak english . 
  sweden is a tiny country , your days of being the model of the wellfarestate we need to copy on everything are over , germany has already replaced your place as our top trade partner and a human has limited number on languages we can learn . 
  so it should be english , german , french , chinese , spanish , whatever that can actually benefit you . 
  of course if you are looking forward moving to sweden it is a completely different thing , but that applies to every country and language possible anyway . 
  the mandatory swedish is only a tired remain of our time swedish times , nothing more . 
  for a while after the wars it was our way of connecting and getting closer to west and further from russia . 
  nowadays it just simply does n't serve any purpose . 
  there are like 5 % of finlandsvenks and they all speak finnish anyway so yeah . . 
  if you are motivated by the fact that maybe once in your life a finlandsvenks wants to have service the in place you are working in swedish because it 's his/hers right and they enjoy annoying you , be my guest and learn it . 
  overall the language question is age old and goes way beyond the reasons this dude thinks they go . 
  because hey let 's face it , if we really would be pissed for something it would be because you guys chose to sit on your well-fed healthy asses and and even denied the help from other countries passing trough during the wars , right ? 
  hehe just kidding ... or am i ? 
  no but seriously , we do n't speak it , end of story . 
  tldr : ** we do n't speak it . 
  ** there is nothing else in it . 
  i do n't do it to payback for the things my ancestor experienced or something equally stupid , i just do n't . 
  just like i do n't speak hungarian or something , and it is not an insult that should be taken personally . 
  if you do you should pull your head out of your ass . 
  the relations are something this dude has no idea , but bottom line is that they are good and we love swedes . 
  this guy \u2764, 
  i have a feeling the comments are going to be good :d everything in this is adorable , from the fact that a competition called `` giant pumpkin european championship '' exist to how proud the guy holding the sing looks , you can see how pleased he is :d even the pumpkin is somehow super cute , but maybe im just nuts, 
  ... can someone explain what 's happening in this picture ? 
  oh my god these are _ beautiful _ . 
  just breathtakingly gorgeous , just seeing these make me feel better ... until i return to the reality and look out of the window to the cold pitch dark finnish fall : :( just decided i need to go to menton . 
  i have to admit , number 3 was hilarious . 
  it is impossible , absolutely im-pos-sib-le to try to have a conversation about x thing russia did without somehow and i mean any way possible , them finding a way to blame the whole thing/point out how usa did this x thing too so hey let 's concentrate on that instead of the actual subject . 
  there does n't exist a conversation about russia in the history of the internet without america being part of it . 
  including america is just the standard . 
  ca n't happen without it . 
  edit : aaaand what was the first comment i saw after finishing this and scrolling down : , d, 
  finally someone does something . 
  this madness has been going on for way too long . 
  unfortunately even if their permission to host the competition would be denied today it would n't bring all those who collapsed while working back to life . 
  even if this was just more like a symbolic gesture and they they knew it would n't really lead anywhere , they are forcing people to notice what 's happening . 
  good job . 
  well , sure . 
  however you did n't really express if you are just delivering information of how the russians are educated or if you believe it yourself . 
  people understood it was the latter , and downvoted you ( since it was extremely offensive ) . 
  to be honest i was confused myself which one it was , but did n't downvote you since i was n't sure . 
  so , which one it was ? 
  okay , i am sorry if you feel this way . 
  i think the problem was that it was very unclear if you think yourself like that too , or were you just describing what 's happening . 
  why did you remove the rest of your text ? 
  it was just the cherry on the top . 
   before that there were irrelevant fights in western europe , africa , pacific + we were involved into few minor conflicts over liberation of lands which were rightfully ours as a heritage from russian empire ( poland , baltics , finland , etc ) . 
  yup , sounds quite familiar . 
  it is either a ) you had to attack because we were such a huge threat to your existence or b ) we were n't really independent . 
   even had to deal with those nasty nazis to get the territories back with minimal effort - that was kind of diplomatic victory . 
  mmm . . yeah well . . hey btw , do you believe this yourself ? 
  how popular you would say these beliefs are in russia ? 
   was the soviet invasion of poland , annexation of baltics and ** finish war ** a preventive measures before inevitable war between nazism and communism ? 
  if by finish you mean finnish , the answer is no . 
  there you go , i answered with a fact . 
   your and our representations of this war are completely different ( even on a historical level ) well to be fair , the historical facts are not emotional subjects , they are simply facts . 
  and they can \u00b4 t be really disputed . 
  just out of curiosity , how your representation of war is like ? 
  jesus , out of everything , i think the `` thanks merkel '' - bs rages me the most . 
  it is some next level stupidness . 
  huh , what you mean ? 
  your food is too delicious , your people too friendly and men too goodlooking-kind of stuff ? 
  hey , same . 
  is n't france the country that has won the most wars in history anyway ? 
  their national anthem is about _ watering the fields with impure enemy blood _ ffs, 
  don \u00b4 t know . 
  maybe in some way yes , some ways no . 
  of course i have limited experience from elsewhere . 
  anyway i do sympathize a lot with you , i was personally suprised of this since i would have imagined finland would be worse for foreigners . 
  i can imagine it can be really hard to make new friends in finland . 
  if you want to share your experience , did you feel lonely or were people rude or what happened ? 
  i am sorry you had a bad experience . 
  :( and this is not sarcasm . 
  ( altough i have to add helsinki is real finland , or else i have been living in lie my whole life ), 
  okay , that \u00b4 s it . 
  can someone explain to me why r/shitenglishpeoplesay does n't exist ? 
  let me get this straight : you are really saying you are unaware of england \u00b4 s part in the great famine ? 
  but you know , i wouldn \u00b4 t be that surprised if you were serious . 
  r/europe seems to be flooding with brits ( or more like english ) whose little education has been replaced by nationalism . 
  right . 
  didn \u00b4 t realize you were trolling first . 
   very few people move away from our country to escape poverty like they do in india or poland or ** ireland ** . 
  unbelievable . 
   and even worse , then she said the exact same thing to the cashier , the poor guy whaat ?? 
  okay that \u00b4 s not even funny anymore , there was something truly wrong with her . 
  glad you come out safe and unharmed , you never know about those crazies what they are up to . . 
  i would have probably lost my capacity to act in that kind of shock . 
  but seriously , that is really strange behavior , i would go as far as saying that is a little bit rude to invade people \u00b4 s spaces when they are trying to mind their own business and survive through their day . 
  i have been alive for 21 years and that has never happened to me ( i naturally mean by people who are sober here ) . 
   `` the store is strangely empty today , '' she said . 
  '' ... yeah , '' i said . 
  she wasn \u00b4 t even forced to talk to you , that truly was casual small talk for no reason . 
  what caused her to go so insane , don \u00b4 t know , poor thing . 
  people sometimes behave irrationally under a lot of pressure , maybe she was on the verge of a burnout or meltdown or something . 
   explains the finnish stranger who tried to strike up a conversation with me in the checkout line at the grocery store the other day . 
  in sweden ? 
  yeah he was drunk . 
  ( or then it was a girl who thought you were hot . 
  in that case , hello ! ), 
  according the [ expat insider ] ( https://inassets1-internationsgmbh.netdna-ssl.com/static/bundles/internationsexpatinsider/images/2016/reports/ease_of_settling_in_index_full.jpg ) ** mexico ** is the easiest country to settle and to make friends . 
  don \u00b4 t think so .

you just proved how stupid you are . 
  how did you end up reading this comment now ? 
  actually lapland is the only part of finland that is in scadinavian peninsula . 
  go fuck yourself \u00c5ke . 
  also known as `` stupid sweden '', 
  \u00c5land does n't want to live with you anymore . 
  i did n't even consider that : o. 
  propably . 
  but u.s waitress will not get extra working late or working on sundays . 
  finnish waiter gets approx . 
  7-13 $ / h so u.s waiter needs to atleast have one customer an hour who buys food for $ 28 - $ 52 and tips 25 % ( for good service ) . 
  of course if you 're exceptional on your job you can earn more than the finn . 
  gave their lives so boldly, 
  those who live in northern parts of norway also buy their booze from finland , because it 's cheaper . 
  that 's the same reason why we go to estonia . 
  oh so finland is cheaper than germany ? 
  really ? 
  so do you consider finland eastern or northern ? 
  lucky you . 
  we have sweden and russia . 
  i can understand what you mean . 
  shhhh ... do n't tell them . 
  we love you guys . 
  finnish defence forces are pretty much like that mag-lite in your cars trunk : old-fashioned , ugly and smells a bit weird , but you can trust that when the shit has hit the fan and you need it , it works . 
  amnesia : the dark descent , witcher 3 , hearts of iron series and gta series . 
  also my summer car , of course . 
  i do n't see anything that involves a country significant ( social security , laws , rights etc ) . 
  we have got over that . 
  that is hugely simplified . 
  most of my friends are patriotic university students , who travel much . 
  those were the good days for us . 
  no one cared about finland . 
  though nobody cares about finland nowdays either . 
  we just do n't want to share our powerful standing army with you guys . 
  finland , and other nordic countries . 
  i do n't like indo-european family that much . 
  funny thing is , we still have more soil on scandinavian peninsula than danes . 
  okay , i know its because we talk funny . 
  not because of history or anything , because throughout histrory , we were pretty much sweden . 
  you dont understand the context of nationalism . 
  it was born to fight tyranny of monarchs and to give the people the right to form their own nation . 
  it was never about superiority or hatred towards others , just a will to form your own way of life . 
  i know it might be against your worldrevolutionist agenda to think so , but nationalism wasnt always about hatred . 
  yes , neonazis and other idiots have made it look really bad , but it is not real nationalism . 
  also difference between nationalism amd racism is that nationalism wamts to buold better tomorrow for the nation . 
  racism builds nothing , only takes down all that has been made . 
  but you are saying that never can nationalism and tolerance co-exist . 
  i think you are just ignorant towards history . 
  wow . 
  so many people here have no idea what nationalism is . 
  rather ignorant . 
  nationalism is a political view that points out that nations should be ruled by the people of that nation , rather than a multicultural monarch . 
  also it decleares that all nations have a right for their own goverment . 
  you just dont care about the historical context ? 
  its just part of the tax pool and used for something . 
  i just thought its cool if you have a specific use for it . 
  well . 
  that might be because baltics are also northern europe . 
  but when i enter tallinn it feels like southern helsinki . 
  thanks , neighbourino . 
  what 's the deal with finland in that map ? 
  edit . 
  you wanted to point out the best part of europe . 
   socialist system social democratic * , 
  in finnish schools on geography class they teach that norhern europe ( not the nordics ) is baltics , nordics and the british isles . 
  that 's what it is according to un also . 
  according to finnish companies , your tax system rocks . 
  also , i heard a rumor , that you use your alcohol tax ( our money ) to fund culture and youth sports . 
  is that true ? 
  because if it is , that 's awesome . 
  estonians are finnic . 
  latvians and lithuanians are baltics . 
  do n't mix them up with slavs , buddy . 
   edit . 
  and to answer your question , estonia has done lot to become a nordic-style welfare state but is n't yet there . 
  they do use the progressive taxation though for natural persons income tax , if that 's what you are asking . 
  you got that right . 
  and when you meet with a swede , never let him bring the beer . 
  `` you '' . 
  dude , j\u00e4lkiuunileip\u00e4 is the only option . 
  cheese and rye bread i think, 
  true . 
  i thought i could manage a conversation with a dane with my basic swedish skills . 
  i was so wrong . 
  i know he meant it . 
  he just did n't say scandinavia , he used the nordics . 
  dude just get on with it . 
  and when it comes to kalmar it was somewhat independent time for finland , because the danes did n't bother much about the finns . 
  it was also an ironical joke , not my political view , that i tried to use to easen the mood in this conversation . 
  but still he was talking about the nordics . 
  but yeah . . to other topic : so ? 
  should we do the kalmar-trick once more ? 
  do n't worry sweden . 
  finnish is also considered nordic and we use \u00c5\u00c4\u00d6 with you . 
  we 'll always be with you . 
  it depends . 
  our concersations are pretty much the same . 
  swede : . . ?!, 
  do n't mix the facts in to this discussion . 
  i know .

our reporters `` lost '' 192 wallets in cities around the world . 
   in each , we put a name with a cellphone number , a family photo , coupons , and business cards , plus the equivalent of $ 50 . 
  we `` dropped '' 12 wallets in each of the 16 cities we selected , leaving them in parks , near shopping malls , and on sidewalks . 
  then we watched to see what would happen . 
  mostly to trigger that estonian guy by posting a map that follows the exact lines as this : http://i.imgur.com/nv4wrwz.png, 
  700 usd is about 600 eur , not considering currency changes . 
  this newer map from 2017 that was posted below shows about the same : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_european_countries_by_average_wage, 
  but most of finland is north of norway since noone lives in the sperm tail of norway . 
  wow , almost like subreddits consist of multiple individuals !,

   he says he 's a student so he ca n't be fired . 
  just some dumb thing a student said , it seems . 
  students can be kicked out of schools which is done regularly , even for false accusations with no evidence . 
  parents and/or kids have jumped on some new trend they found on the internet probably . 
  most people do n't know what afa/antifa is and have never heard of it because media does n't write about them . 
  in sweden , the state police have them ranked as the biggest threat to the nation but they are still protected by traditional media . 
  i believe the lands and peoples similar to africa were south ( harad ) and east ( rh\u00fbn ) of the map of middle-earth . 
  something like this : https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/39c4192546be3ef0f5e5043297b3307d75c844a0f3d5cb0928b46ff9caeaf029.jpg although i think this particular picture is fan-made based on theories .

  * https://undocs.org/s/2016/738  confirmed . 
  you 're parroting american hawk talking point thanks for your input , buddy . 
   i 'm not saying his actions represent finland at the time ` very well ' , no need to put words in my mouth . 
  i 'm saying that we should be honest and frank about it that shitty things were done in the name of the country rather than try to gloss over it and start talking about them being ` denied entries ' or pointing to mannerheims personal efforts . 
  your initial post that started this chain talked about * `` it was only recently that it was found out that finland actually deported some jews to nazi germany during the war '' * which simply is n't true because it had very real consequences for finnish politics and was even posted in the newspapers at the time causing public outcry , and * `` the explanation [ ... ] that finland ended up in the war like a driftwood , against it 's own wishes and had absolutely no culpability in the matter '' * implying finland somehow steered into the wars on purpose . 
  leaving the obvious defensive war of 39-40 aside ( that had been preceded by military budget cutbacks as late as 1938 - not the best if preparing for a war ) , the whole reason the war of 41-44 is called * the continuation war * is because it 's a direct consequence of the previous soviet invasion . 
  the soviet union again started making aggressive demands like the ones predating the winter war ; now they wanted the petsamo area with its valuable mines . 
  finland , on the other hand , wanted its second largest city back and the homes of 400 000 karelians , for one thing . 
  pretty legitimate reasons for a counter-offensive . 
  however , the fact that the military went * past * the 1939 borders and the reasons behind it are taught in schools : some , including those in power , sympathized with the idea of the time to `` unite finnish-speaking peoples '' , while the military mainly to take ground that is easier to defend ( i.e. 
  along the coasts of ladoga and onega and river svir ) , and to have territory to bargain a peace with . 
  here we do have a question of ethics , especially considering the russian karelians who were moved to detainment camps where many starved to death , but also going past the previous borders devalued the claims to our own territories . 
  then again , who 's to say that the finnish lines had n't fallen quicker if they had stopped at the 1939 borders ? 
   try to gloss over it and start talking about them being ` denied entries ' you 're right - i remembered it wrong . 
  they were austrians who had likely arrived in finland already . 
   that 's because i would like to discuss the matter in a neutral manner , which is pretty hard when people get so upset over even mentioning it and have to go into defensive mode . 
  nothing to get defensive over , it 's not your fault . 
  not even if you 're directly related to anthoni . 
  now who 's putting words in whose mouth ? 
  disagreeing on a subject does not equal `` getting upset '' . 
  maybe you 're confusing me with some of the other commenters . 
  we should go chill with hawaii . 
  alaska can come too . 
  you say so , yet burning to death is one of the worst possible ends . 
  sorry to say , but you probably only had the illusion of choice - both presidents would follow the same path to increase us power . 
  the goofy , friendly , `` i 'd have a beer with this guy '' - presidents clinton and bush jr. both ran the same policy of war to increase power and destabilize growing factions . 
   yes , it was not at all bad compared to other places in europe and for the most part finland protected the jews within it 's territory really well . 
  however , that still does not excuse the shitty parts . 
  i 'm arguing that the actions of this one man , the same actions that were publicly denounced by civilians , politicians and the head of the military , do not represent finland very well . 
  can you truly blame norway for the actions of breivik ? 
  the one using chemical weapons on civilians ? 
   how so ? 
  such as russian involvement in syrian government forces chemical weapons attacks and russian cluster bombing without regards to civilians and so on . 
  and , yes , us-supported forces have been involved in using white phosphorous weapons , which is not better at all . 
   thanks for proving my point . 
  and what point would that be ? 
   as far as i 'm aware , this was not a case of denied entry but a case of deporting german refugees who had arrived in finland before the war and some of them had even received asylum . 
  they might have entered before the outbreak of the war , but i have n't seen any dates other than when they were deported :  in november 1942 , eight jewish austrian refugees ( along with 19 other deportees ) were deported to nazi germany after the head of the finnish police agreed to turn them over . 
  seven of the jews were murdered immediately . 
  according to author martin gilbert , these eight were georg kollman ; frans olof kollman ; frans kollman 's mother ; hans eduard szubilski ; henrich huppert ; kurt huppert ; hans robert martin korn , who had been a volunteer in the winter war ; and an unknown individual . 
  when finnish media reported the news , it caused a national scandal , and ministers resigned in protest . 
  this put a stop to any further deportations and of 500 further refugees , mannerheim personally helped 160 refugees move through finland to neutral sweden . 
  when i mentioned `` us '' i was indeed talking about the united states - a shorter name for the united states of america , where people commonly referred to as `` americans '' come from . 
  finland is not referred to as an axis nation since finland never signed the tripartite pact . 
   particularly , there is some strange narrative that finland won the winter war and the continuation war , when in fact it lost both of them . 
  there is no such narrative in finland . 
  schools clearly and literally state that finland lost both wars . 
  however , finland succeeded in stopping stalin 's total occupation ( for which there is plenty of evidence : like the baltics & the rest of eastern europe , puppet communist terijoki government ready to take over , plans for occupation drawn up in 1938 before threats even began , allied need for iron mines in sweden , opening up the bay of finland for the baltic red navy ) and came out of ww2 the only country attacked by the ussr who still stood independent with a capital that was never occupied or destroyed ( or even had enemy boots on the ground ) . 
  finland , a democratic agrarian nation of 3.6 mln living on the brink of poverty , with a neglected and chronically underfunded military without defensive lines , a people devastated by a bloody and bitter civil war , managed to scramble together all they had to stand up and defend their freedom from the largest military in the world led by an insane , brutal , communist murderer . 
  if this is n't the perfect inspiration to jrr tolkien 's classic good versus evil in lord of the rings , i do n't know what is . 
   exaggerating the finnish victories ( which were impressive enough anyway ) , glossing over the cooperation with the nazi germany and the role finland played in starving out a million people in leningrad . 
  the wiki disagrees with you . 
  it says finland refused to follow german orders and participate in the siege . 
  russia is likely fueling the conflict between far left and far right . 
  the migration wave from africa and me is also being made worse by russian actions in syria . 
  i 'm also suspicious towards the us for continuing to destabilize europe through their actions in syria and the middle east . 
  the soviet archives were opened in the 1990s and that 's when it was discovered to be a fabrication . 
  yeltsin was the one who admitted the ussr had been the aggressor and staged a false flag operation to create a casus belli . 
  denied entry to a family from germany who regrettable were sent back . 
  later traded finnish-russian pows in germany for soviet pows in finland , some of whom happened to be jews . 
  it was not systemic , since no ethnic separation was made in finland and finnish jews fought in the finnish defence forces like everyone else . 
  finland has been recognized by israel as `` righteous of nations '' due to the actions during ww2 . 
  why is it so important to you that details of the attack are covered up ?

  one year i had a good year with my crops and you the next so we shared . 
  climate and a small population in a huge land area forced us to work together in a way that was n't necessary in warmer climates . 
  this i believe created a society where everyone was willing to work together and give some of theirs to the benefit of others . 
  this shows in our willingness to pay sometimes ridiculous taxes . 
  this is also why we 're very equal between genders as we just had to be equal . 
  the short summers meant that we had to be efficient , very efficient . 
  we did n't have time to debate over issues and had to go with the most practical solution . 
  if someone got offended for not getting to say their opinion , so be it , but mostly we just let everyone say their opinion and make a decision fast based on that . 
  this shows in the way we have meetings still today . 
  everyone comes in , says what they have to say , we make a decision , in-out start cracking . 
  if we made the wrong decision we just make a new one . 
  basically our history from before the industrial revolution laid the foundations on where we are today and how we work as a society . 
  so one could say that we today enjoy the fruits of our predecessors way of society . 
  we also never really had a very strong class society . 
  sure we had kings and nobles but even they relied much on the work of the rest of the society so once industrialisation became a fact the upper classes were n't as hesitant to share the riches , which if i have understood it correctly was n't the case in many countries . 
  anyway , there is no clear answer to why we have managed to do so well . 
  i think that 's why we keep on working on getting better all the time as we do n't feel like we are doing so well . 
  we feel small compared to other countries and maybe we have some little brother syndrome that pushes us to try to be best at everything . 
  which comes with a cost . 
  sometimes i wish that we could relax a little bit . 
  take time to enjoy a nice meal , not do everything by the book and just live a little . 
  long story short . 
  it is good to live here , but it is n't a utopia by any means . 
  tell me about it ... 
  i feel flattered . 
  but something tells me i should n't as a male . 
  i think that at least among finns we see estonia as a brother nation . 
  we might give them a hard time and so on but deep inside we like them . 
  for me at least estonia feels more nordic than any other baltic state . 
  not completely nordic but almost . 
  i like the british arrogance to be honest . 
  i do n't mind it , as if there is one thing you brits do well is that you manage to say go fuck yourself in a way that most people do n't realise you said it before they come home ten hours later . 
  where ? 
  people are drunk all the time here  politicians maybe but the people , not so much at all . 
  sometimes i wish we 'd be more reserved with alcohol but then i remember my nice whisky and forget all about that bad idea . 
  we did n't get our wealth for free . 
  it has taken very much hard work and a decision on a national level to get to where we are . 
  norway is a little different as it has oil and gas . 
  politically correct is more sweden whereas the danes , finns and norwegians are fairly out spoken . 
  naive i can agree with . 
  as someone that has lived abroad i sometimes get pissed off over how naive some people here can be . 
  then again norway has ridiculously bad roads with retardedly low speed limits . 
  now germany has much going for it . 
  i mean culturally we 're very similar . 
  having worked in an international environment germans and nordics seem to always go together very well . 
  germany is also efficient in many ways the same way as the nordics . 
  this is why i believe that it would benefit all of our countries if we had a union of our own . 
  lol seriously ? 
  did i say that ? 
  no i said that what is more important is to measure both objectivity of the press and the freedom of the press . 
  something people here seem to have a very hard time understanding . 
  that is a very slippery slope . 
  personal attacks naming a name if based on lies are regulated by law and do not fall under freedom of speech . 
  opinions that are n't directed agains a single person or group of named people is a completely different story . 
  saying that `` i hate finnish people because they 're all alcoholics '' does n't single out any specific finn . 
  is it a nice think to say , no . 
  should it be allowed , yes . 
  sex which is a physical act can not be said to be the same as freedom of expression . 
  i mean it tells a lot about pro eu people when they downvote comments that value freedom of speech . 
  then they wonder why more and more people do not want anything to do with the union . 
  just goes to show that the eu is the new ussr . 
  well i do n't take it personally so i really do n't care . 
  but it is true what you say , 
  since i learned to speak i 've had two languages finnish and swedish . 
  since i was six i had english as my main communication language outside of my home until i was ten . 
  so if the technical definition of mother tongue is that you have had to speak it before the age of three i only spoke two . 
  since i was a child i 've spoken three maybe one of them does n't count as a mother tongue officially . 
  as and adult i speak english at home and at work , swedish and finnish on my free time that is outside the home . 
  christ people are very fanatic about euronews . 
  well anyhow if it rocks your boat so be it . 
  www.bbc.com/news/ you are welcome . 
  well it is available is n't it . 
  just the means to view it is different from country to country precisely like euronews . 
  so now i 'm racist . 
  ok thanks i guess . 
  big government and nationalization sure is left rather than right as just few examples . 
  national socialism as a ideology is very far from liberalism and conservatism which are on the right . 
  hence i 'd argue that if we are to use a scale of right and left national socialism should not be on the right . 
  i 'm not taking any stance on what political ideology is good , bad or ugly i 'm just saying that the use of `` far-right '' is in my opinion flawed . 
  tell me where i can get euronews in finland without having to pay for it on cable or satellite ? 
  same damn argument . 
  what about homes ? 
  i can not get euronews at home without having to pay for it . 
  bbc i get for free . 
  so why not just allow any european broadcaster that wants to air it , air it . 
  the greeks again . 
  i see . 
  well sorry for forgetting that you still exist . 
  i speak three . 
  you sure , i 've watched bbc news in germany many times . 
  i mean it 's not like i get euronews for free at home either . 
  according to who ? 
   euronews says 2.6 million viewers tune in weekly across europe , but that is only a small fraction of the 180 million european households in which the channel is available . 
  its audience share in some individual markets is tiny . 
   in britain , for example , about 0.5 percent of households watch the channel at least once a week , according to the broadcasters ' audience research board , a rating agency . 
  that is about the same percentage that fox news of the united states reaches in britain , despite more limited distribution , and considerably below the 19 percent weekly reach of the bbc 's 24-hour british news channel . 
  http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/12/business/global/12euronews.html?_r=0 seriously seen euronews on a tv once , which is amazing if it is the most watched news channel on the continent . 
   i guess saying some of them out loud is . 
  that 's the problem . 
  i do n't have to agree with your opinion that all jews need to go away but you still have the right to express them .

  it 's a small market , but there are some that could use them even today . 
  i bet it 'll be better in a decade with better batteries , charging and denser network of charging stations . 
  why is that ? 
  i was under the impression that they work decently during winters as well ? 
  absolutely . 
  and even if we entertained their idea about paganism , finns had their own version of paganism and there certainly was no odin . 
  so even in that sense , they screwed up . 
  that 's understandable , though , figuring out a name in english and a norse god sound pretty cool if you 're 12 and making up a secret society with your buddies and those guys are practically overgrown children anyway . 
  it hardly goes unnoticed , it just understandably takes the backseat . 
  virtually . 
  so brush up on that 360noscope . 
  it 's amusing that they use both a foreign language and a foreign god in their name . 
  that is just too perfect for a bunch of retarded loonies `` protecting the local culture '' . 
  they sure have taken their time to come up with anything concrete . 
  i 've heard a lot of talk for at least a decade and a half , yet very little to show for it until recently . 
   are you really sure you 're not a soviet country ? 
  at the time those were built ? 
  it 's hard to say , really ... 
  definitely worth an honorable mention . 
  i was sure it 'll be there . 
  yes , that 's kind of my point . 
  modern first world countries finally figuring out that children should have basic human rights as well as adults is hardly `` the first step to persecuting jews . '', 
  if they were smart , they 'd stop cutting kid dicks . 
  that 'd make it impossible to take the first step to persecuting jews . 
  i was there last week and while i loved everything i found it funny that it was cheaper to just turn on dataroaming on my finnish phone than pay the hotel for a wifi . 
  duh , only one player throws at a time , what do you think the rest are doing ? 
  maybe it 's regional then , i would n't know . 
  at least in my circles pretty much anyone interested in sports follow both football and hockey . 
  there 's plenty of people who give a shit about football . 
  there 's like a billion people playing it globally , we just ca n't expect to do very well when it 's not even our most popular sport and there 's only 5.5 million of us . 
  that 's because in the states everything undesirable can be described as socialist . 
  how much value should be given to comments that do n't even try to be factual ? 
  dumb parisians , they should 've traded the cars for helicopters . 
  yeah , it was strange . 
  it 's astonishing and a bit scary to think how eagerly people actually start believing in anything , no matter how crazy , in a situation like that . 
  at the time i remember the music being blamed a lot . 
  i remember there even being rumors about some sort of `` satanic cults '' or whatever , trying to recruit teenagers , even reported in the papers and warning kids about in schools at the time . 
  then again , i lived in hyvink\u00e4\u00e4 back then , so maybe the rest of the country was n't as ridiculous as hyvink\u00e4\u00e4 was , considering that 's where it happened . 
  the early versions were lacking features but it got better . 
  i 've used more recent ones at work and they 're actually pretty good and would be a decent choice for some crowd and i like the hardware a lot . 
  if they only got it better earlier it might have taken off , now there 's just no reason to get one instead of androids . 
  yeah , the same thing happened in finland a few years later after a few black metal fans tortured and chopped up someone . 
  fortunately the outrage was forgotten relatively quickly . 
  at least in finland those are n't considered flags . 
  sure , but as an anthem , it 's a great song . 
  i was n't trying to be clever or overly pedantic . 
  i was just trying to figure out some sort of a ballpark figure to understand the idea she tried to get across . 
  the answer seemed as reasonable as any other arbitrary definition in the thread , everyone has their own reasons and none of them seem any more rational than the others . 
  it 's a great question by op . 
  for me it 's not primarily about the looks , though . 
  the main thing is the accent . 
  if someone speaks with a strong regional dialect , my first reaction is that they 're somehow `` more finnish '' than someone else who speaks more neutrally , even if both are fluent and sound finnish . 
  i 've never thought of this before but it somehow seems to make sense to me , haha . 
  yeah , that 's pretty much what this whole thread boils down to . 
  for example , i do n't agree with the person i responded to and quite frankly think her definition was a bit silly to me but i really ca n't say why . 
  to me it just seems wrong , while my own definition is n't any more justifiable . 
  my own thoughts on the matter are n't very clear even to myself and i certainly ca n't try to convince anyone else that my view would be `` better '' . 
  it 's not even a shared regional standard , i bet you could ask the question of all the neighbors in my building and get a dozen different answers , without anyone being able to back up their views with anything concrete . 
  this thread is so interesting to read through . 
  you have to become french at some point over generations , though , it 's just a question of how many generations you think it should take . 
  when you go back far enough , by your stated criteria , practically every frenchman is found to be something else . 
  i know you did n't mean it like that , so i was trying to find out how many generations it 'd take for you to consider someone french ? 
  grandparents born in france ? 
  their grandparents ? 
  what about people whose parents or grand parents etc. 
  are from africa or wherever not-france ? 
  do they become french at some point in your eyes ? 
  there 's saunas in restaurants sometimes , usually with private cabinets . 
  you can dine in private and enjoy a few beers in a sauna afterwards . 
  it 's pretty much the best way to start a night out . 
  basement would probably nee a lot more work , especially if you go for a wooden one which is a lot better . 
  the key to a good sauna is ventilation which might be tricky to get right when added as an afterthought . 
  if you can , the easiest way would be to build it like a garden shed , separate from the house . 
  that way it 's easy to ventilate and you can have a wooden stove without added hassle of getting a chimney for it through the house . 
  a beer wo n't hurt and an experienced sauna goer can feel it when they 're getting too hot . 
  for first timers it 's probably for the best to go there soberish to get used to the feeling . 
  electric ones are heated with a stove too . 
  an electric stove . 
  and yes , you still throw water to it . 
  without water it 's just a hot room , not a sauna . 
  we 've done it at home or in sports bars a lot , would be nice at the arena as well . 
  there 's an another room to cool down in between attached , nobody 's going to sit in a sauna for a few hours in one go . 
  i bet there 's more saunas in finland than in germany and the states combined . 
  you 're wrong , and more importantly an idiot . 
  germany and the us are doing it wrong then . 
  oh , i get it now . 
  you 're ignorant _ and _ a moron . 
  i thought i was speaking to a normal person , sorry for the confusion . 
  you have no idea what youre talking about . 
  then again it 's hardly surprising , when you 're taking advice on building saunas fron germans and americans . 
  i 'm sure they 're much better at it than finns , you know , the people that actually invented the concept and loaned the word for it to pretty much every language ... 
  in reality , saunas are heated with a stove , period . 
  no additional heating below the benches or anywhere else . 
  for a bigger sauna , there 's a bigger stove , surprisingly . 
   like 30 year old  older oh come on , we 're not _ that _ old yet ... 
  right ? 
  average . 
  not lowest , average . 
  a lot of the time it 's colder than that . 
  even for someone used to cold temperatures that seems a bit much .

switzerland is not in scandinavia . 
   time for some of us to go to switzerland and beg . 
  what does this have to do with the post ? 
  iceland should have the haploid groups of the group that settled in there . 
  so iceland should somewhat match norway . 
  if there are 3 millions saunas shared by little over 5 million people , then about every household has a sauna of their own . 
  my mother chose to go poland this summer . 
  partly because of the terrorist attacks , partly because its really cheap there . 
  well i think it would work culturally as well . 
  i think people would take more offense if you switched the nationalities . 
  so calling finns russians that try to act swedish . 
  but generally . . meh . 
  i guess as a finn we would be somehwere between swedes and russians . 
  but the most funniest thing in the chart i think was that the russians reingned by a volunteer . 
  i was never told that . 
  granted i grew up in quite small town in finland . 
  but still i walk to bus and from bus stop to my apartment drunk at nigth every now and then in helsinki . 
  and before this whole migrant wave thing i never even thougth about it being unsafe . 
  yeah i wonder about that . 
  i mean if this posted right after the screenshots were taken , the trip would have taken place in monday after noon . 
  not a prime drinking time . 
  plus this was wooden church . 
  those dont survive as well as stone ones . 
   hungarian is the only language in the world where the main word for `` yes '' is n't one syllable . 
  in finnish yes is kyll\u00e4 . 
  which has two syllables . 
  so that is n't true . 
  i would be far more embrassed about being in erotic store buying a porn magazine than it being on my bank details . 
  thats why i do all that kinda purchases on the internet with my credit card . 
  would also work . 
  i was wondering that . 
  her photo looks really familiar , not that i know her . 
  but just i see a lot of people who look like her here . 
  that name does n't sound swedish . 
  cant say anything about her looks since your link does n't work . 
  you think peopel suddenly would want to fuck their siblings just because a law was n't there anymore ? 
  or parents making their children marry each other ? 
  because i dont see how arranged marriages have to do with incest . 
  or incest havign to do with grooming ( which i thougth ment a form of pedophilia ) . 
  how so ? 
  i mean pedophilia would still be illegal . 
  i would argue incest being legal would n't increase pedophilia . 
  if the end game is dead i guess the number of attackers does n't matter . 
  but about anything else i think less attackers the better . 
  with rape i would imagine the attack would just last longer in general with more attackers , which to me is instantly worse . 
  i would say gangrape is always more serious than a ` regural ' rape . 
  with just one attacker there atleast is a chance of getting away or figthing . 
  i have no idea of etymologi , but pirtti nowdays means either a very small rural house ( like just a one room ) or the kitchen/living area of a old rural houses . 
   also , remember that until very recently ( well , maybe still ... ) , the eu was talking about redistribution . 
  as a migrant , you 've no idea where you might be redistributed -- you might spend a year learning german and then be dumped in france , so you probably do n't want to commit many resources to it . 
  i would think that you could affect where you are going to end up by learning the language of the place you want to end up . 
  want to go to france ? 
  learn french and increase your odds . 
  and so on . 
  i personally dont think if somebody is great that they also are good or moral . 
  if somebody says alexander the great i dont think he was anyway good person just that he did something big . 
  does great britain mean the its somehow morally good ? 
  no its just big . 
  did n't he change uk from absolute monarchy to what it is today ? 
  i would think that is what pushed him to to the top 10 . 
  the country would be compeltly different without him . 
  were they ? 
  i always got the impression that they actually did n't improve many of their technologies because they had a large number of slaves . 
  i mean why invent something that will either cut the manpower needed or make it safer for the laborers when you can just throw another group of slaves to do the work if the first one was n't enough . 
  i was not expecting the end . . 
  the way he speaks is very common in finland . 
  he is clearly fluent , but he has n't really talked a lot in english . 
   the fact that you have one swedish class on your curriculum does n't oppress you , it gives you access to swedish , danish , and norwegian , if you want . 
  i dont mind there being a compulsory language there . 
  but i do think it would be better you could choose what language . 
  for example russian could be much more useful language to some . 
  whats with that savonian invasion to the west coast . 
  looks totally out of place . 
  but is n't that a really good place for his statue ? 
  beczause he literally took the power from the king and gave it to the parlament ( even though he first played king for awhile ) . 
  i think it depends a lot when the rape happened . 
  yesterday , yeah its completly ok to start crying when you just a see man . 
  and it would be reasonable to try to avoid peopel who remind you of the rape . 
  half a year a go , yeah you cant keep living your life fearing everyman you come across . 
  i had the same thing when my brother commited suicide . 
  for few weeks any mention of suicides ( jokes , just casual mentions ) and siblings made tear up immeditly . 
  and that is normal and it is also normal to try to avoid those things as much as i possibly could . 
  but overtime i got somewhat over it . 
  suicide jokes are n't funny to me anymore , but those dont make me cry . 
  same with talking about siblings . 
  but what i mean with this , it migth be beneficial for rape victims to have a space where they can feel safe , untill they can get themselves together . 
  i actually wondered about this when the original post about this place came up . 
  would men prefer male or female staff ? 
  in a way i would think female staff would be less treathning , but male staff could be more relatable to men in general . 
  i have never understood how you defend yourself against humans with a gun . 
  i mean if i knwo someone is coming over and is going to attack me , then i could get prepare for that . 
  but thats not how things usually go . 
  your attacker will be the first to pull a gun , and you have to react to them . 
  so you just get shot going for your gun , or are too slow for even to attempt to go for your gun and get hold up by gun point . 
  home invasion scenarios make even less sense . 
  you would have to keep loaded gun next to your bed and i would think that would be way more risky than the odd chance someone is going to invade your home while you are there . 
  from what ? 
   but i only support conscription at times when there is a direct attack on the homeland by an outside force . 
  in times of peace conscription is stupid . 
  but it is beneficial to have atleast somehwat trained standby army , before the conflict starts .

  well , maybe you pussies should have taken it to talks with imperial russia first ... you had well over a hundred years to do so but only `` activated '' when finland became independent . 
  which kind of does n't ` work ' because veps were never under swedish dominance and would and still use russian calendar yet they call it ` hay month ' as well . 
  i 'm also 100 % it 's heinikuu in karelian because y is n't used like that in finnic due to vocal harmony . 
  it 's a simple math that if you have to use at least two hours for the repairs and you have to charge 60 $ per hour to make ends meet then most people will find it easier to just buy a new phone . 
  american is what i 'm referring to , as far as i know european minx does n't really do that kind of killings . 
  it 's closer to otters in temperament afaik . 
  soviets had all kinds of `` fun '' ideas about agricultural ` improvements ' . 
  raccoon dogs are probably among the most harmless projects of theirs to `` harness the mother nature '' . 
  - yes , it was an official soviet goal . 
  minx kill and kill and kill if they can ... 
  i guess you 've never seen what a minx ca do in one night at an outer sea island community of birds such as mallards ? 
  though i 've heard that this kind of ` overkill behavior ' happens in foxes and wild cats too but more rarely . 
  northern scandinavia and kola peninsula are n't right . 
  the artic sea coast is almost completely treeless and should be classified as permafrost zone . 
  yeah , first ones were deliberate introductions , later they mostly came as escapes from fur farms and by time the mistake was realized it was already too late . 
  similar thing happened with the grey squirrels of england . 
  some ass hat did n't want to care for his pet squirrels anymore and set all three loose ... 
  unfortunately they multiplied like the pests that they are and are now the dominant squirrel species of the island . 
  but most animals do n't kill more than they need and horde the excess in their burrows and then forget they have the ` stash ' until its rotten putrid or frozen to solid block at winter ... 
  so they start over . 
  thus leading to that famed musteline `` killing sprees '' for which the minx in particular is renowned for . 
  some owls have that same hoarding instinct , so it 's not unique to wolverines and minxes alone . 
  they were originally introduced to europe because `` biologists '' at the time thought that american minx was a subspecies of the european minx ... 
  so they figured to strengthen the over-hunted populations with more `` robust blood '' from america . 
  as was quoted satirically in saturday night live !, 
  about bush junior 's speech of the second gulf war some 20 odd years ago ... `` we sure as heck know the iraqi 's are having wmds . 
  we ( the americans ) have the receipts ... '', 
  well they were originally invented by phoenicians which the greek borrowed and in turn were borrowed by the latin people aka romans and then western europeans . 
  our numerals are called ` arabic ' but they 're in fact indo-iranian in origin . 
  as far as i know only zero is directly from arabic , even though ` nullus ' as a concept was known very well it did n't have a specific numeral before the late middle ages . 
  i guess you 're not aware that hebrew is a semitic language , closely related to arabic ? 
  ofc the today 's israeli are heavily mixed but their still `` arab enough '' that you could n't tell the difference between an israeli and jordanian if they 're wearing the same clothes . 
  pretty standard for an arab country and yes israelis are ` arabs ' even though they vehemently deny it . 
  it was because back in the early years of wow horde & alliance players had a feud-mentality going on and the mods got tired of the `` spies '' & `` trolls '' - complaints and it was decided that horde and alliance players could no longer `` understand '' their each others . 
  so lol turned to kek in `` hordish '' and bur in `` alliantic '' ... 
  there was even an add-on called babel fish for awhile but the devs turned the algorithm to fully random once they got the wind of it , to make sure that both sides would be speaking complete gibberish when using / say - command . 
  those were some classy homes back in the gaslight era . 
  honestly , this looks like the beginning for a monty python skit . 
  nah , they 're just migratory workers with relaxed italian mentality towards property ownership and entrepreneurship laws ... / s, 
  a lucifer 's touch , taste the love , the pain and the passion of the one whose sleeping in the fire ... 
  we beat canada , though !, 
  or we could buy greece out from it 's debt only have them blow it all and come back asking for more the next year . 
  yeah itella is a pos and has been for years . 
  it does n't strictly speaking go through it , you have remember that star trek had eugenics wars and ww iii and from the looks of it eiffel tower is the only structure standing anyway from the present day aside from that aqueduct . 
  hyperloop system ? 
  it 's not like the idea of a tube train is new . 
  they can announce a diplomat as `` persona non grata '' but this is rarely done ironically enough due to diplomatic reasons ... 
  having the train carrying stalin from siberia to st. petersburg at 1917 to crash & burn would have been even more beneficial for the russians . 
  i 'll just leave [ this ] ( http://comics.wata.fi/fingerpori/fingerpori-21-03-2012.gif ) here, 
  my thoughts exactly , you can count on spaniards showing off ~ ~ wo ~ ~ men melting masculinity where and when ever they can . 
  nothing that obama did but the fact the elections were coming and rebs had to find a way to utterly trash obama from getting absolutely nothing done to look bad in congressional elections or the whole house would have been full dem basically and you might imagine what a shit that would had been for rebs . 
  real kicker however is that rebs want go the rid of because they did n't implement it first not because it 's bad or does n't work and dems do the same for anything popular or famous that rebs have set up on their term . 
  dna has just yesterday offered a deal for our block of flats where each household will get a plan for unlimited broadband access for 5.60 $ / month . 
  ofc it 's the cheapest option - the actually useful one is 9.90 / month with up to 100mb speed and up ( more you pay , faster you go ) . 
  modem and cables are ` on the house ' from the net provider as usual . 
  i think it 's pretty good deal in comparison to most of europe . 
  russian special police force , mainly a tool for putin to beat down the protesters . 
  they do the regular police as a military ala swat things as well . 
  original grand idea was that `` we represent everyone so why not let everyone join '' and well that plan was a spectacular failure . 
  it brought in a lot of votes and a lot of eccentric `` every man '' candidates of which many turned out to be out right racists who could n't keep their mouth shut in social media and had absolute 0 experience on being in the spot light ( avoiding yellow press ) or from politics in general for that matter . 
  whole macron & his party is pretty historical . 
  i 'm pretty sure than no other new party in france has ever gained this kind of landslide and also a president at the same year no less . 
  it 's a traditional finnish mentality that a man does not back from his words and halla-aho obviously aspires to be the epitome of finishness in the media . 
  in the same vein in his opinion it 's morally right to air one 's views and opinions not matter how wrong they are for the rest of the population or how unwanted his `` truths '' are to hear . 
  worse part is that she seemed pretty smart the last time i spoke with her during her campaign . 
  scary how smart people become complete nut jobs all of sudden . 
  law ( or political agreements strong as law not sure which ) require that the political pamphlet of the government is followed if not to the letter then in intent at least . 
  orpo has a problem of having most of his voters as pro-feminist women from larger cities who despise halla-aho because he is an evil racist and sipil\u00e4 does what ever is best for his party which in current political climate is to not work with halla-aho . 
  bear in mind that orpo himself has been convicted of assault and battery when you fling that `` evil racist sentenced in court '' - stuff about halla-aho around . 
  there is a theory that this is why the mosquitoes make that noise ... driving their prey to run up and around in frenzy , so it 's nice and docile and all those juicy veins - ohh , so lovingly throbbing just beneath the skin after it has worked itself into sweat soaked frenzy and is too tired to move . 
  there are mosquito species that do n't need water other than rain to lay eggs and grow as a larva ... 
  well , it 's a very popular `` recreational flower '' , ai n't it ? 
  actually that was entente and after the second war nobody cared anymore as germany was divided between commies & capitalists . 
  football and finland disagree about being in the same sentence . 
  ooh thanks for that , no wonder that quote seemed to fit so close to narrative . 
  well considering that russian gdp was and still is comparable to italy despite being a supposed super power they got what they deserved tbh . 
  he also stated that he would only be a republican because they would be only ones stupid enough to vote him for president or something on those lines . 
  though i assume it was meant as humorous quip it does hit a bit too close to mark . 
  what i was going for is that orja and arya share the root word in * vedic sanskrit * from where it was loaned to old persian dialects same as vasara ( vazra ) and that language has been dead for something like +3000 years, 
  while at it ... you can also ponder why arya and orja ( slave/thrall ) are cognates . 
  after -30 it 's not really that much different to -40 . 
  but if it 's windy ... in -30 you feel like your face has paralyzed and in -40 you start to wonder if it 's already fallen off ... 
  yay us ... 
  the only group in europe who share haplo group with north american natives . 
  ca n't help but wonder jut how ancient that particular haplo group-lineage has to be to be only seen in finns with any frequency in europe . 
  also if a reindeer is n't allowed to piss at certain intervals it can get a condition where it 's unable to do so without help and may eventually die because of it . 
  there are stories that the tough guys used a cigarette holder to get their reindeer 's to pee and that the toughest ones did it even without a one but the lapps have a reputation of spicing up their stories though . 
  do n't think finland has ever won san marino in football though ... 
  also 3 strikes on driving qualification and with each fail you have make extra hours before next try . 
  fails means 3 things like not letting a pedestrians pass , not using a signal , going over 40km/h in city limits etc. 
  `` a major risk or carelessness '' is an automatic fail in the test even not being familiar with car and fiddling excessively with controls can be counted as a fail . 
  test also includes the feared parallel parking that counts as a fail , pass or the fuck you thought you 're doing try again , you cunt ? 
  smoking indoors is banned as well as smoking on your balcony in apartment blocks , which most just blatantly ignore and housing boards are loath to enforce the rule for their housing stock owners . 
  and at this little moment you recall by which two countries belgium was divided between off for the most of it 's history ? 
  well , forest of ardennes and the charcoal forest sort of converged around brussels back in the early middle ages ... 
  so at one point there were quite a lot of trees in the benelux . 
  oh they know exactly what they want and it 's power unlimited power and easiest way to power is to get unwashed masses to rile up over nothing for the thought that some one is finally doing something for them . 
  yeah , it has great natural beauty belying it 's harshness ... last major famine of `` hunger land '' was as late as 1902-1903 . 
  the countryside is as rugged and poor as you can image from that picture for farming . 
  it 's has n't been that cold even for a week since the river is n't frozen over .

  that also assumes that most eu workers are in low wage jobs which is n't the case as a large majority are skilled professionals . 
  i dont think you with a swedish-finn fiance has a much better idea of how nordic immigrants are being treated after the vote than a nordic immigrant living in the uk like myself ?!, 
  i 've even heard of 15 year old kids being harassed for speaking finnish on the street in remain-voting london . 
  you 've just shat all over eu nationals ( all want to work illegally , not pay tax , fight over below minimum wage jobs because none are skilled enough to actually be in professional jobs ) but you are some beacon of tolerance for having a swedish-finn fiance and also apparently understand how finns are treated in the uk better than finns in the uk themselves . 
  i dont know any leave voters ( or at least any that admit to being one ) so dont have much else to go by . 
  all my british friends are remain voters who actually have pesky eu nationals like myself as friends . 
  chances are 572 of them voted to leave . 
  that would make sense to me but its not necessarily the case , on reddit i 've seen lots of these type of comments `` lol i voted to leave but gaining irish/german/other eu country citizenship so we can keep them out but we can still access eu '', 
  so i should also assume most people voted leave so they can stay in the eu ? 
  no i 'm pretty sure it was an intended consequence , since the leave vote was mainly about eu immigration !, 
  nordic people have been harassed in the uk along with those from poorer countries so dont think the average daily mail reader differentiates between one eu national from another and nor should they ( not that they should harass anyone at all , but that they should n't harass a polish person any more than a swede ) i also dont think you can blame immigrants on the minimum working conditions and wages set by the uk government, 
  not all but enough for the vote to have gone the way it did , even though 6 months later the people that voted for it dont know what `` it '' is . 
  i 'm not assuming anything . 
  i 'm talking about the specific actions of 2 people trump and niinist\u00f6 and your disapproval of niinist\u00f6 not being misogynistic like trump . 
  not only swedes , but all eu nationals which includes swedes . 
  the irony of them voting to leave the eu to keep swedes out of the uk , then applying for swedish citizenship so they themselves can stay in sweden . . 
  hey , sorry to disappoint but trump election doesnt suddenly mean treating women like objects / being misogynistic is now cool , funny or smart , except maybe at r/the _ donald, 
  correct but it doesnt invalidate what i said . . he has a 2nd wife because his first one died , not because he switches to a younger version every ~ 10 years like trump, 
  ok thanks for the clarification . 
  in that case , it would make sense if the br from brexit came from britain since those 2 are the ones that wanted out . 
  since when is britain only wales and england ? 
  i thought it was the name of the island which also includes scotland . 
  it 's not quite the same . 
  niinist\u00f6 's first wife died in a car crash , its not like he just switched her for a younger model like trump does . 
  incidentally he was also a survivor of the 2004 indian ocean earthquake . 
  its just really unoriginal , that whole finland conspiracy thing has been done to death on reddit . 
  you 've said yourself elsewhere on this thread that this is a click bait low quality paper so unsure why you are still arguing . 
  i 've already explained why italians being anti-immigrant does not mean they are necessarily anti-eu immigrants or anti-eu or populist , so wo n't keep repeating myself, 
  not really , based on the kind of articles they 've come up with over the past half year . 
  not desperate at all . 
  it just irritates me that british newspapers are trying to make it seem like all of europe is eurosceptic when they are n't . 
  when people talk about `` immigrants '' europeans probably consider these to be people outside the eu , while the uk considers these mainly to be people within the eu . 
  so while the survey may be ok , the newspaper is trying to twist it into something it probably is n't, 
  but the problem started off with existing people who were already making the dangerous journey . 
  the uk 's policy means that , after that dangerous journey , they should go back . 
  cool thanks !, 
  i 'm pretty sure this whole article is false , but if it is n't , then i 'm sure italians dont have problem with immigration from the eu i.e. 
  finland germany etc while the uk do . 
  italians are pro-eu . 
  no surprise this kind of article comes from a british `` newspaper '', 
  no its worse . 
  do you think taking in these refugees is at zero cost to germany ? 
  so germany is by far doing more than uk , they are spending the money and taking people . 
  germany has taken much more than 150k , you dont get to compare 1 years worth of efforts by germany to total efforts made by uk though even if you did , germany would 've still done more . 
   ample eu contributions which you are trying to get rid of . 
  the uk has taken in a lot less refugees than other european countries . 
  any money put towards the problem has been to keep the refugees out of the uk, 
  why is it in russian then ? 
  what are you on about with regard to who gets to decide ? 
  op decided as the op , a reddit post doesnt need agreement between countries and if it did then the uk definitely wouldnt get to decide as the country that has helped refugees the least . 
  not really . 
  population says more about resources than land i think . 
  otherwise greenland would have more resources to help refugees than most european countries but they dont . 
  well , it was on the official welcome sign at helsinki airport . 
  or was for quite a long time , not see it for awhile . 
  i suspect next slogan will be : welcome to hel . 
  surprised the guy is n't happy with the space he already has going there tbh . 
  glad people are n't continuing to attribute this to airport when it was at slush . 
  what was at airport ( or was last few times i 've been ) is w.t.f. 
  ( welcome to finland ), 
  true but your one shows applications not approvals so its not totally comparable to op 's numbers . 
  i also think it was late in 2015 that merkel said refugees welcome in germany so dont think 2015 is the year to look at but 2016 if we are talking about germany, 
  fair enough for posting but this data is pretty out of date . 
  first i thought the numbers looked low but its just that its out of date , referring to 2015 not 16, 
  per capita would make more sense . 
  uk has a much larger population ( 65m ) than sweden ( 10m ) so the difference is actually much bigger than just the literal numbers . 
  what is it ? 
  ok so you mean you want control over the trading relationships / laws of the uk , fair enough . 
  single market = eu hence the confusion . 
  if you want to change laws in the single market , the only way to do so is staying in . 
  i agree , the referendum had nothing to do with the eu , just internal affairs . 
  its true that the far right parties supports the no side but that definitely does not mean that everyone on the no side supports the far right . 
  its just the media trying to connect the vote with far right to make it into a bigger story than it is . 
  i 'm glad this has become so popular on reddit but its not from the airport but the slush event in helsinki . 
  in the airport they at least previously had w.t.f. 
  ( welcome to finland ), 
  why do you want out of the single market ? 
  what is causing this ? 
  til that finland has a `` celebratory ( or party ) liquor '' for next year and its vana tallinn . 
  never tried it before , sounds good !, 
  obviously his wiki page wo n't mentioned it you muppet u/nounhud as its damaging to his reputation . 
  thanks u/angeldust01 even if its not hugely reputable that particular source its been mentioned in reputable sources many times before, 
  not really . 
  tariffs are n't the issue , its common regulation tariffs are n't really an issue in the modern world anymore , its ease of trade with differing regulations, 
  as far as i know , each country has rights to control external immigration . 
  just not within schegen ( so your average swede or dutch guy `` invading '' austria ) so eu national can come in . 
  so whats the problem ? 
  you can control any external people coming , finland has and indeed reduced their refugee benefits to equal sweden because so many left sweden for finland because of better benefits so they wanted to even things out . 
  based on this , i truly believe every eu country can limit their refugee / immigrant intake ( from outside the eu ) so i 'm not sure what you 're worried about . 
  they may not be welcome in austria but believe me they do have control of their external borders , just not amongst us europeans . 
  i know i probably will seem ridiculous right now , but i wouldnt be surprised if our treatment of syrians/iraqi in 20 years people viewed europe the same as the americans who said they ca n't help the jews in the 40 's and sent the back to europe which lead to extermination camps, 
  everyone has asked `` so does it mean leaving single market ? '', 
  and may refuses to answer , repeating `` we are looking for the best deal for the british people '' . . she knows leaving single market is not best for british people ( the uk 's biggest export market , 50 % in fact ) so no , its not clear whats she 's saying . 
  an fta would be crap for the uk , uk is 80 % services and an fta doesnt include that . 
  its not working too well for them though , unless you want to proceed with the tactics of your late countryman that caused some chaos amongst europe . 
  perhaps they should go the eu route instead ? 
  cooperation instead of hatred ? 
  do you know how long the border with mexico is ? 
  wrong https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/27/uk-to-deploy-hundreds-of-troops-and-aircraft-to-eastern-europe, 
  i was being sarcastic .

  you stand alone with that claim . 
  referencing internet repositories of studies is common in academia . 
  frankly , your argument is about as acceptable in academia as `` dog ate my homework '' . 
  another irrelevant point . 
  you made a blanket claim that `` ect is barbaric '' . 
  attempting to shift blame for your ignorance and rapid backpedaling on this issue is just as reprehensible as your earlier attempt of shit flinging through accusations of homophobia . 
  that was n't a question , and we both know it . 
  it was poisoning of well through implication of guilt of thought crime on my part . 
  even a cursory reading of this discussion so far demonstrates the malice and bad faith you espouse by even raising it . 
   as a source , this amounts to junk . 
  be sure to try this excuse on your university professor . 
   the elites that detain tens of thousands of people , torture , maybe even kill opponents , silence the media and political opposition . 
  i 'd call that rogue . 
  by this logic , all elites are rogue . 
  prisons exist for a reason . 
  defining what is criminal is up to the electorate and the people elected by them . 
  refer to the original statement up in this thread . 
  do you at all understand the concept of `` discussing the principle , and then discussing the details that contribute to it '' ? 
  that was n't the argument . 
  read the actual argument . 
  yes . 
  it 's the same `` electorate is dumb , racist , sexist , misogynistic , xenophobic and is a basket of deplorables '' argument that has been used by elites to disparage the voters who dare to vote against them lately . 
  major societal issues have been put to the referendum - such as adopting the euro . 
  putting potential future similar decisions to the popular vote of the demos is also wildly popular - i.e. 
  potential nato membership applicatin . 
  then i suppose you belong in the category of people who 's actions are damaging to the society itself and who can not be reasoned with - they can only be prevented from damaging the society further . 
   the left has made it blasphemy to discuss these issues ? 
  correct . 
  read on `` deplatforming '' of critics that has recently been institutionalized by the modern regressive leftists . 
   the issues they 've been fighting to change the conservative status quo ? 
  what do you do with a powerful political machine that met all its goals ? 
  you invent new ones , and when these new ones are shown to be extremely authoritarian , you silence the critics . 
  this is not a new thing in political sphere . 
  i literally quoted the oecd report on the issue in this very thread . 
  which elites are `` rogue '' ? 
  they clearly represent will of majority of electorate . 
  by your logic , the people calling for this intervention are the `` rogue '' ones , as they are clearly going against the will of democratic majority . 
  think for a bit before you throw buzz words around , lest they come back to bite you in the ass . 
  ah yes , another '' #bringbackourgirls '' . 
  sigh . 
  do read the link . 
  it debunks your hypothesis completely . 
  and that is exactly the attitude i 'm talking about among locals . 
  decline of their own state and its economy is irrelevant , because of potential personal gains . 
  `` it 's going to happen anyway ( and i have a good chance of getting a better life off of it ) so why even try addressing the problem '' . 
  nice shit flinging . 
  you forgot to also accuse me of racism , sexism , misogyny and call me a deplorable human being . 
  you think wrong . 
  the debunked bs story that was ran here talked about polling for small local issues , mainly due to low effort and low populace numbers skewing the polls . 
  your entire point of contention is in my language skills in modern world where media provides wide array of translation and analysis in a number of world languages ? 
  that was n't a problem fifty years ago . 
  this is easily bypassed by passing hires on to another party . 
  you just mentioned a personal problem that you have . 
  i am discussing trump . 
  so you literally just ignored my point , and decided to restart the argument from the beginning with wide sweeping and utterly unsubstantiated claims . 
  i 'll take that as you conceding the point i make above . 
  so by your logic , it 's a good thing that we essentially have a social support system which permanently keeps economies like that of your state in the shitter , and ours in good shape , and then pumps a kind of `` state social support '' out of rich countries into the poor ones ? 
  even foregoing the ethical problems with this setup , do you at all comprehend that this will work only until there 's a political will to keep making these wealth transfers to the eastern europeans states . 
  and that will is rapidly waning . 
  not to mention that there is a limit to how much damage a state can take from this kind of brain drain before it enters a death spiral . 
  your entire argument here is `` well this exists elsewhere too , so there 's just no problem '' . 
  try applying the same argument to different problems , and you 'll notice that none of these problems actually go away with it . 
  all you get is the fact that you also have a problem elsewhere . 
  all of which are part of the problem i 'm talking about . 
  the reason why poor countries receive money is to build up their society and infrastructure so they can become more like rich european countries faster . 
  `` people are stupid to vote on actual text , but smart enough to decipher if people they vote for can represent their point of view when voting for said laws '' . 
  do note that you have it backwards again . 
  what you 're saying requires people to be * smarter * - not only must they understand the laws , but they must also be able to judge if people they vote for are equipped to represent their points of view in parliament . 
  the main reason we have the current system is in fact to create inertia and inefficiency within governance , which is a stabilizing mechanism that creates continuity . 
  not , i did n't say that if you do n't have direct democracy , then you 're literally hitler . 
  i said that * your argument as to why we have representative democracy is idiotic on merits , and provided an example to demonstrate why * . 
  here 's hoping it sticks to growing and economy actually gets on some kind of a reasonable growth trajectory in long term . 
  next elections are a long way from now . 
  that has zero chance of providing the kind of help that is being asked in a timely manner . 
  close as in `` close enough to cause significant enough alarm in power circles of washington '' . 
  not as in `` we were getting the alliance formed '' . 
  again , hegemons do not tolerate peer competitors , and prevent such competitors from forming long before the formation is complete . 
  and you 're forgetting the third option - eu and russia share common interest in surviving the globalised world as independent entities rather than vassals of two new giants of the world order - us and china . 
  both of these are geopolitically stronger than eu and economically stronger than russia . 
  that gives us a natural interest to combine the strengths to compensate for weaknesses . 
  i 'm not talking about a union . 
  i 'm talking about a strategic alliance . 
  but in lesser numbers , as contact network formed during the exchange period would not be in place . 
  your argument assumes that this is some kind of a well thought out solution with goal of solving the entirety of the problem . 
  i think that this is simply an act of desperation which results in trying to erect any kinds of obstacles in hope of slowing the flow down . 
  notice how i did n't mention his political leaning on left-right scale at all , because on this topic it 's simply irrelevant . 
  what matters is his attitude toward eu and it 's values , which is overwhelmingly positive . 
  you want to get one first before you leave however , because that 's how you get a job in wealthier economies that does n't involve menial labour and low wage . 
  the worst known example is latvia . 
  after fall of ussr , it had 2.7 million people . 
  today , it has less than two million . 
  that 's over a quarter of a nation gone in two generations . 
  lithuania is in the same boat . 
  its numbers are 3,7 million and 2,9 million respectively . 
  eu forecast stated that it 's going to lose another 40 % of its population by 2060 if trends persist . 
  you 're looking at depopulation at a scale usually seen only in long going warfare . 
  there 's a pretty good oecd paper on the issue here : http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/social-issues-migration-health/coping-with-emigration-in-baltic-and-east-european-countries/executive-summary_9789264204928-3-en;jsessionid=11m8a6yca2l52.x-oecd-live-03, 
  when folks like henri-levy state that they think that if referendum was held , france would likely leave eu , it 's extremely likely that this is the case . 
  he 's one of the biggest supporters of entire concept of eu and is ideals after all . 
   i think he 's just stating a fact .

  so , by nature the initiatives of the commission often are against national interests , because by nature the commission looks for the eu as a whole , what serves the eu as a whole . 
  this is reflected in the oath the commissioners make : * i solemnly undertake : [ ... ] to be completely independent in carrying out my responsibilities , in the general interest of the union ; in the performance of my tasks , neither to seek nor to take instructions from any government or from any other institution , body , office or entity * frankly to me it seems that your opinion about the commission is based on populist yellow press and euroskeptics who like to paint everything relating to the eu leadership as corrupt bureaucrats serving the interests of industry and acting as safe guarders of national governments . 
   it 's true some mep , i do n't remember who , included some statement about net neutrality into much broader telecommunication regulation and it was passed . 
  reddit jump to it as a glorious victory , mainly because the situation in the us . 
  well , it was victory on the part of parliament . 
   acta was indeed rejected but only because the outcry , without it i believe it would have been passed . 
  considering that the parliament has over 700 mep 's and acta was rejected with 478 votes and 39 votes supported it , i think it 's obvious there already was strong opposition towards acta . 
  and if the public outcry managed to sway the opinion of the parliament that much , i think it also is impressive how much the public opinion influences the decisions of the parliament . 
  that the commissioners being `` heartless bureaucrats '' is just a continuation of the politics we vote on national and eu elections . 
  not something independent of our voting behavior . 
  well , the lisbon treaty did grant more power to the european parliament , as it gave the parliament the power to reject the budget proposals for the eu and increased the legislative power of parliament mostly to the same level as the council of ministers , so yea , the eu has made changes to be more democratic . 
  but these changes to be more democratic have to be agreed by national governments . 
  the eu itself can not change the structures , as the structures are set in the intergovernmental agreements signed by all member states . 
   i guess the thing that bugs me is if we were to elect a european council of ministers more directly it would be certainly be more varied cabinet than the one appointed by national governments since the dominant national party would n't have the final say , rather it would be the public well , in a sense that would defeat the purpose of the council of ministers representing national governments , and make the council of ministers just another eu parliament , just smaller . 
  national governments would not have any representation in the eu that way . 
  are you mad that a party which deliberately picks someone incapable of being a commissioner to be commissioner , is the leading party in germany ? 
  well , do n't vote for christian democratic union if you do n't want them to be the leading party in the council nominating the commissioners . 
  but the parties stance on the eu does matter . 
  for example the center party is supported by many because the general stance of the party is somewhat skeptical towards the eu . 
  it 's one of those background issues that influence the voting behavior of a large group of voters . 
  and of course voters have the right to be not interested about the eu and not hold it as a deciding factor . 
  the eu is not to blame for that . 
   yes thats how it works in finland but in countries where you do n't have such big multi party coalitions winner takes all when it comes to the council of ministers . 
  and the winner takes it all also in the national government . 
  it 's not something to blame the eu , bu the national government and the people who voted for it . 
   the annoying thing is i would like to vote directly for who controls europe and not the parliament that observes and votes on what they decide , no matter what way it 's framed the eu is less democratic than the nation states it supersedes and that 's a fact . 
  one of the functions of the current structure of the eu is to distribute power , not centralize it . 
  commission is like the government of the eu , and it looks out for the interests of the eu as a whole , trying to coordinate different policies and suggest improvements which would be good for the eu as a whole . 
  but it can not pass laws , it can only make initiatives and execute already passed laws . 
  council of ministers is like the upper house of bicameral legislation branch . 
  it is there to make sure national governments have a say on the laws . 
  council of ministers is there to make sure the eu or eu citizens do not totally fuck up the interests of individual governments . 
  parliament is like the lower house of bicameral legislation branch . 
  it is there to make sure citizens have a say on the laws . 
  parliament is there to make sure the eu or national governments do not totally fuck up the interests of eu citizens . 
  together with the council of ministers they keep the commission in line of the interests of citizens and national governments , as council of ministers & parliament are those who have the power to reject the initiatives of the commission or fire the commission . 
  yes , the eu is less democratic , because the eu is based on inter * governmental * agreements , and is an inter * governmental * cooperation , meaning the member * governments * have a say on it 's structures . 
  one reason for this is because many governments are skeptical of deeper european integration , which means they want to hold on to governmental representation and power on the eu and not give power to eu institutions ( namely the parliament ) independent of national government . 
  thanks for the clarification !, 
  i do appreciate and try to remember next time !, 
  do you have trust in any directly elected institutions in general ? 
  like do you have any trust in your local ( directly elected ? ), 
  parliament & municipal councils ? 
  also , the parliament * already voted in support of net neutrality * and the initiative for net neutrality came from the commission . 
  likewise the initiative to remove costly mobile roaming charges within the eu came from the commission and the parliament approved it . 
  parliament also voted to reject acta and voted a resolution against sopa . 
  for example our national government signed the acta agreement , but parliament overruled that , saving finland ( and other eu countries ) from acta and the interests of national governments . 
  what i 've been following the eu politics , the parliament does a pretty good job in protecting the interests of the citizens when our national governments screw up . 
  what usually is the dragging anchor in eu institutions is the council of ministers , which actions tell more about the collective will of independent governments than the interests of eu-oriented commission and citizen-oriented parliament . 
  our current prime minister is also swedish speaking , though i do not know has he officially registered as such . 
  yea , so it 's * one institution of the eu * opposing net neutrality . 
  parliament for example supports net neutrality . 
  and the council of ministers is in the eu roughly to safeguard the interests of national governments within the eu , whereas the parliament is there to safeguard the interests of the citizens of the eu . 
  so in essence it 's national governments through eu institution opposing the represented will of european citizens . 
  not `` eu not wanting '' . 
  a similarly misleading title would be if the us congress supports thing a , the president has not made up his mind and the senate opposes thing a , that situation would be presented as `` the united states opposes a '' . 
   you might say that 's just the luck of the draw but people do n't vote for national politicians based on their european politics or ideology so it 's not democratic when them same representatives nominate a european commission that holds all the power in the eu . 
  for example true finns in finland got a lot of votes specifically because of their eurosceptic views . 
   national elections are not fought on eu issues so why should the winning party get to decide what direction the eu takes ? 
  did you not follow the finnish national elections in 2011 ? 
  the euro crisis was one of the main topics of the elections . 
   the ttip debate reflects this perfectly , it was made by an unelected council of ministers and not supported only recently by a majority of the european parliament . 
  the council of minister reflects the national elections . 
  for example the finnish representatives in the council of ministers are ministers of the government of finland , and the government of finland is formed as a result of national parliament elections . 
  at this moment the parties & ministers representing finland in the council of ministers are from the coalition party , social democrats , christian democrats and swedish party , because those parties are in the finnish government as a result of the finnish parliament elections . 
   for that to be democratic you have to assume national governments act in the interest of all their voters , by and large i do n't believe they do anymore . 
  democracy does not mean that every decision by the government/parliament is supported by all of the voters and as such , national governments never act in the interest of all voters . 
  democracy is about compromising different ideologies and politics . 
  if parliaments & governments could only make decision if their decision is supported by every voter , nothing would ever be achieved as there always is some citizen who disagrees . 
  instead , democracies have the government and the opposition , as parties have the right to refuse making compromises and refusing to take part of the government . 
  true finns in finland for example did not want to compromise and decided not to go to the government . 
  that 's their democratic right . 
  i would n't call the european commission a heartless bureaucracy . 
  they are nominated by the european council consisting of every eu head of state/government , and the nomination is either approved or declined by the parliament . 
  the commission somewhat reflects a combination of the results of national elections and eu parliament elections . 
  i hate this game , because there 's not much to present :( [ olavinlinna ] ( http://www.roughguides.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/42-24376527-1680x1050.jpg ) , the worlds most northern intact medieval castle .

  i 'm not completely familiar with the political system in germany , but here in finland it is completely normal that parties make compromises to be in the government . 
  every party in essence is a majority provider for the largest party , but for the other parties to agree to form a government , the largest party has to make some compromises , but also in order for the other parties to be accepted to the government , they have to make compromises with the largest party . 
  then the government has a common governmental policy agreed by all the governmental parties , who each make compromises in some areas to influence on the government policy on other areas . 
  after this the parties work together to implement that government policy . 
  with a system like this it is normal that government parties do n't aim to realize all of the things they have supported outside the government . 
  if none of the parties make compromises , no majority government is formed and the government is unstable . 
  so every party makes compromises . 
  and because smaller parties have less power , smaller parties have to make more compromises to have an effect on the government policy . 
  if the smaller parties are n't willing to make any compromises , they never get to influence the government in any meaningful way . 
  the reason opposition parties have radical suggestions is because they do n't have the responsibility of governing . 
  with the responsibility of governing comes the need to compromise your views . 
  think about a crowd of grumpy angry citizens . 
  they all complain how the government is shit , things are done wrong , the leaders have betrayed the people , and things should be done in different ways . 
  everyone of them have their own views what should be done , and they vocally shout out their opinions and complain about the leaders . 
  they can be so vocal , because they are not the ones leading the country . 
  now , give that crowd the responsibility to form a public policy which the majority of the crowd supports and agrees to implement . 
  if everyone stubbornly holds on to their personal opinions , no policy supported by the majority is formed .

  stop . 
  just stop . 
  yeah , they deserve free money , free house ( preferably a big one ) and a european wife . 
  nothing less is grave abuse of their rights . 
  shame !, 
  shame !, 
  gosh !, 
  no one surely saw that coming right ??? 
  right ?? 
  welfare tap is n't as loose in those places . 
  clearly the benefits in portugal were n't to their liking , tells the story quite well . 
  indeed , if something had been done before , it would n't have gotten to this point . 
  same in finland . 
  detroit of europe . 
  yeah these types of things should be implemented . 
  some kind of islam with european characteristics should be the goal . 
  finland seems to walk the same path as other western european countries too with government sponsoring things like their native language schooling and culture things . 
  i am really on the opinion that people are allowed to do lots of things as long as it 's done with their own money and not on government 's dime . 
  i mean they can have their arabic language lessons but it has to be done privately , government should only support the things mandated in the curriculum like finnish , swedish , english , german etc. 
  the retaining of own culture does n't help with integration one bit . 
  paraphrasing our state media last september : `` lines of highly educated people are heading into europe : professors , doctors , teachers ... '' aaaaaaand forward to this day , according to the government study even some of those migrants who have marked themselves as highly educated on the self assesment had trouble with writing . 
  i think we hit a jack pot here guys . 
  can the host country send the ambassador back in these cases or what usually happens if they ca n't be prosecuted ? 
  hahahahahaha !, 
  you got me !, 
  and you would let people who you do n't know anything about to let freely roam around ? 
  it 's total lunacy and it wo n't be allowed again because if some country does that for prolonged period of time , every country bordering it will have border controls in place soon . 
  then they keep coming and other actions have to be taken . 
  free money finds its takers always . 
  it would make it worse and they can be held there until they are deported . 
  it does n't make sense at all that they can roam free in the mainland while their status is still unclear/waiting for deportation . 
  that would be pure lunacy . 
  he can take them to live on his house then , there 's some human rights . 
  i hate it when they use the `` it 's human rights '' argument every time , according to that you ca n't do anything . 
  do you let people then roam free on your territory as illegals ??? 
  it does n't make any sense except somehow does in europe . 
  indeed , handing out free stuff is the main pull factor , but it 's hardly discussed at all . 
  i think the terror law change is off the books after the coup , there is no way they will comply with that but i believe eu will let that pass . 
  in reality coming from a safe third country is a valid reason to reject asylum . 
  other reasons include the possibility of escaping to a safe area within the original country , this applies to many people from iraq who instead of coming to eu for welfare , could have moved to baghdad because it 's classified as safe . 
  in fact almost all iraqi asylum application are rejected nowadays in finland based on this provision of the agreement . 
  the real pace of the deportations to turkey is actually very slow , not that many have been deported . 
  the real reason why people wo n't come to europe from that route anymore is mainly that they ca n't continue from greece because the border is closed . 
  no one is going to waste thousands and thousands of euros to smugglers if they get stuck in greece instead of getting to the high welfare countries in central and northern europe . 
  personally i think the deal is still easily worth it but same type of agreements need to be set to the italy route because otherwise the next flashpoint will be there . 
  oh really ???? 
  maybe they should do research into thay , oh wait they did here and result was that people see the sentences as too weak . 
  it 's not bullshit so just stop it . 
  there have been research ( launched by the state ) here lately on how people perceive the sentences given out in this system and it pretty much concluded that people see the sentences as too low . 
  now the justice ministry is doing a probe to see whether stronger punishments should actually be implemented . 
  it 's actually harder to get even the prison hotel sentence than you think . 
  if i went outside and beat someone heavily , it would be extremely unlikely that i got a prison sentence where i would actually have to go to the prison . 
  granted , if the sentences do get increased which i certainly hope they do , they probably are n't as strict as i 'd like to . 
  i am more for a singapore type or system with canings and death penalty , but they are actually much safer than then nordic countries . 
  gosh , can you believe that ?? 
  can you draw a direct correlation like that though ? 
  i could also say that singapore , hong kong and japan are extremely safe societies because they have quite hard punishment for even minor crimes . 
  the answer is that there are more factors that contribute to it . 
  a person in finland is born into this system and thus really has no comparison , the punishment he gets here is the default . 
  but an iraqi person has something to compare to assuming that he even knows little about his country 's criminal system and practices , so he can easily see the finnish system as weak . 
  well this one could have been prevented by not taking these people in in the first place . 
  there are safe areas in iraq and they traveled through many european countries . 
  asylum check at the border and then turn back . 
  my solution would have been not to take these people in the first place and close the borders when the show began . 
  leave the refugee convention if necessary . 
  of course this is n't politically feasible but that 's what would have been the preventative measure . 
  i think justice system like in singapore would be good . 
  total zero tolerance to crimes like that . 
  much safer country than western european countries by the way . 
  they have lots of immigration but they are n't part of the refugee convention and have strict rules on the immigration . 
  japan and singapore are extremely safe , even more than finland but they have quite strict sentences . 
  i do n't think you can draw conclusions like that . 
  well it did n't work for the woman concerned . 
  well if you come from a system where you lose your hand for stealing and end up in a system where if you steal from a shop , you will get a fine that you wo n't even have to pay in the end because you do n't have the money . 
  the sentences are n't credible at all at least in my country . 
  your country might be different but i was mostly referring to western europe here . 
  people in this country in general do n't have any idea what 's going on with the justice system because you actually have to do some research and look at the court documents etc. 
  also the situation in the capital ( around 1/10 of our population ) is totally different to some small town in the north . 
  i was mostly referring to northern and western europe , the countries that took most of the asylum seekers . 
  but yes , eastern europe is totally different . 
  also the top one sea taxi in europe . 
  the problem in modern europe is that everyone has lots of different rights but not really any responsibilities . 
  government pays welfare , pays housing , pays everything . 
  if you do crimes and manage to actually get a jail sentence , then you go the jail which is basically like a hotel here in finland and then you come back and government pays again . 
  zero personal responsibility in anything . 
  yeah the sea taxi service has to stop , it 's just retarded . 
  you know these countries that host most of the `` refugees '' , they only offer the bare minimum . 
  in eu countries they get free money , free housing , free everything . 
  what 's the point of even doing anything if everything is handed for free ? 
  it 's a total recipe for failure . 
  besides why it 's always europe that has to take these , we already take a huge amount when compared to other 1st world countries and our benefits to these migrants are gigantic . 
  japan does n't take really nor does south korea despite these two countries having much higher living standards than many countries in eu . 
  they rarely get same kind of condensation . 
  most of these people travel for the high welfare in central and northern europe , that 's just the way it is . 
  not many would want to travel to finland through europe if it was n't for the free benefits . 
  personally i am quite liberal and have the mindset that people are allowed to do a lot of things if they do them with their own money , but in this case it 's always the tax payer that pays everything . 
  we have to look to our interests and not destroy the cohesion of our societies with huge amounts of 3rd world migration . 
  there are visas for legitimate purposes like studying and working . 
  quota refugees from camps are also taken yearly by many eu countries . 
  eu countries are n't some welfare offices for the whole world where you can just come in take your slice , the system wo n't be up for very long if it goes like that .

  oh , i did n't meant to imply they were n't . 
  it was just a reply to the `` they can do what they want '' comment . 
  the meaning behind it being , that if the eu decides to take action against tax havens ( or really anything that ireland strongly enough objects to ) , as members , they have to follow that decision , but as a free country , they 're free to leave and then do n't have to follow that decision . 
  what ? 
  that 's not really true . 
  when you 've chosen to be part of the eu and accepted that while you 're a member , some decisions taken on an eu level do bind you . 
  it is your country and you can choose to leave though . 
  then you wo n't have the advantages of a membership but you do n't have the disadvantages either . 
  they have freely chosen to be a part of the eu and freely chosen to accept the rules and regulations that come with it . 
  if they do n't want to be part of the eu anymore , they 're free to leave . 
  that 's how it works . 
  i guess the other half things that sweden has been run over by shakira patrols and whatnot , haha . 
  on certain places ( even some places here on reddit ) if you mention reddit , that 's the reaction you get . 
  it 's kinda insane . 
  people do that here too . 
  from what i 've heard the babies sleep really well and they do n't wake up as easily from you doing stuff in the house . 
  hardly first . 
  no thanks . 
  you , those fuckers keep calling out racism , how dare they, 
   because it 's a symbol of islam . 
  i think it 's kinda telling that it 's used as a symbol for islam when talking about turkey . 
  islam is seen as a monolith in i 'd say most places in europe . 
   im not limiting my definition to the western world . 
  im saying that the only royals who continue to have actual power are not in the developed countries . 
  so this comment  hes the president of us . 
  thats as much as royalty as you get in modern era is n't really true then , when there 's people like the saudi royals , who are actual royals with power and wealth and whatnot . 
  so , the what you were saying was that the president of the us is as close to royalty as you can get in the modern first world countries if you use a definition of royalty that excludes all the monarch and such that we usually would call royalty ? 
   its the literal definition , just without the bullshit about noble blood and stuff . 
  so , it 's not really the literal definition then , is it ? 
  i mean , it ca n't be if you 're stripping things out of it . 
   sure , which is why i said in developed countries ( meaning , mainly most of the west and china/japan/south korea ) if you 're going to define royalty differently than it is usually defined and limit it to developed world and then exclude all actual monarchs and royalty , i guess being the president of the us is closest to royalty then . 
  you 're using a peculiar definition of royalty then . 
  i mean , there 's also the saudi royals who are immensely influential and wealthy , that 's the best example of old style powerful and wealthy royalty we have today imo . 
  except for actual royalty like kings and queens and stuff,

  bay of pigs yo, 
  the legends say he ca n't do that unless he 's invited . 
   recent new found love of liberalism liberalism has been a core value of the eu ( and many european countries in general ) for a long time . 
  why do you think being in favour of liberalism is something new here ? 
  pray the train away, 
   that 's what makes me such a sneaky little downvote whore . 
  * downvotes * you like that , do n't you , you dirty little minx, 
  and every time there 's some new thing people are trying out , there 's someone complaining about it . 
  such is life . 
  if it tastes good , why not ?

  that makes no sense to me , like , voting for her out of spite or . . ?

  i 'm sure there are plenty here who do wish that , unfortunately .

  # yeah , that 's pretty alarming and leaves room for serious vote rigging , but that does n't mean the vote was definitely rigged . 
  i 'm personally waiting for further info from neutral parties or at least hoping we get some . 
  i do n't really trust the opposition or akp on this one . 
  and i have no idea how neutral ysk is ( i assume not very ) . 
   he said the ysk had decided to consider unstamped ballots as valid unless they were proved to be fraudulent , after a high number of complaints -- including one from the ruling ak party -- that its officials had failed to stamp some ballot papers . 
   the no campaign said the last-minute decision raises questions about the validity of the vote . 
  but g\u00fcven said the decision was taken before results were entered into the system , and that members of the akp and the main opposition were present at almost all polling stations and signed off on reports . 
  so , could be a fuckup by ysk and the votes were legit in the sense that they were actually cast but it could also very well be that they showeled in yes votes with those unstamped ones . 
  e : and to add , i have n't been keeping up with the vote very much , i just did a quick search for related news articles and checked them when i wrote my original comment . 
  so i think it 's best to consider my comment as just an uneducated opinion . 
   the republican people 's party ( chp ) demanded a recount of 60 % of votes . 
  they criticised a decision to accept unstamped ballot papers as valid unless proven otherwise . 
  #  he and his government say more than 51 % of voters have backed the constitutional reform but the opposition has cried foul , claiming massive irregularities over invalid votes and vowing to challenge the result at the supreme electoral board . 
  http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-39617700 so the opposition is certainly not conceding to a defeat , but i 'm not sure how much water their accusations hold . 
  we 'll probably get more info later on on how the vote was handled . 
  but at least in the couple of news articles i read , there was n't any concrete indication or accusations ( outside of the opposition , as in , by neutral parties ) of rigging the vote in some manner . 
  but again , we might have to wait for that for a while . 
  especially since the vote was so close . 
  that does n't mean he is n't a dictator though ( someone who holds absolute power ) . 
  dictators can be democratically elected , it 's just that usually they are n't . 
  that 's just childish . 
  come on . 
  let 's not vandalize wikipedia to make a political point . 
  there 's plenty of outlets for making that point , such as reddit . 
  i have no love for the guy but i love wikipedia and hate to see how many people here are so ready to vandalize it . 
  i 'm not sure about his reasoning , but vandalizing wikipedia , especially to make a political point is not cool imo . 
  instead of cyberpunk we get cykapunk, 
  oh just wait till the leage of nations hears about this !, 
  it gets kinda mixed up in here but i do n't think most people are anti-russian . 
  most bears are opportunistic omnivores and do n't eat meat at every meal and actually eat more plant than animal matter . 
  and the methane cows release into the athmosphere * is * a huge enviromental issue and something * does * need to be done about it , yes . 
  i 'm not sure what your issue is . 
  you want meat at every meal and yeah , you 're free to do so but it * is * really really tough on the enviroment . 
  do n't shoot the messenger and all that . 
   the planet does not give a fuck about the current state of organisms living on its self .

  there are people , like timo soini , who have drank the krugman koolaid , they think ( and thought back in 2011 ) that grexit would be eventually good for greece . 
  just like quite a number of greeks here . 
  it would not hurt soini 's numbers in polls , either . 
  that part was already drafted , debated and passed in 2012 ? 
   the choice is simple : greece either becomes a debt colony and completely gives up its sovereignty or it gets kicked out of the euro . 
  i think it 's obvious which of the two i support you wanted the german wirtschaftswunder ? 
  you get the wirtschaftswunder , starting with the complete loss of sovereignty . 
   there is no defined legal way to leave emu of course there is . 
  greece can leave eu and then re-apply . 
  most of those are just cheese slicing . 
  and those tax collection reforms - what has changed ? 
  the tax colloection has been reformed every year , and every year the oecd report says they need through reform . 
   maybe finns should ask their government how did greece end up `` owing finland '' ? 
  this was the question for the previous elections in 2011 ; soini refused to be part of the coalition that financed greece . 
  in these elections all the parties except ex-commies were againt giving more loans to greece . 
  there are people on / r/europe that have looked nice graphics that show that greece has implemented reforms faster than anyone in oecd . 
  there are also people who have looked more graphics from the same report . 
  they show that greece is still way behind other oecd countries . 
  and then there are people who have read the oecd report on greek reforms . 
  greek shops can be open for 7 sundays a year . 
  minimum wage has been lowered . 
  that is the extent of the reforms that are actually done . 
  there is plenty of frameworks and planning and matrix organizations , of course , and tax collecting has been reformed every and each year . 
  everything else is just cost cutting - cheese slicing as we say in finland . 
   the imf has been requesting a debt haircut since the original bailout in 2010 . 
  until the referendum last week , germany had outright denied out this possibility . 
  imf can give a haircut to their debts without consulting anyone in germany . 
  germany hardly has enough votes in imf to prevent such haircut . 
  but if imf wants someone else to do the haircut , not themselves , they have not paid the attention . . 
  having an speedy and predictable justice system , reducing the red tape with exports and imports , removing licensing requirements for many professions and industries , actually collecting taxes . 
  that is for starters , and perhaps having shops open for 7 more sundays ? 
  just like insurance ? 
  your expected value from insurance is negative . 
  american politicians are honest . 
  once you buy them , they stay bought . 
   there is a specific amount of licenses available to practice those professions . 
  for instance , you want to open a rental car shop in x city . 
  if there are many there already - the licenses would have been given - and you would n't be able to open such a shop . 
  can you sell your license to someone else in greece ? 
   the eu 's mistake was to break the no-bailout clause in 2010 , which forbids bailing out other countries . 
  eu did not bail out greece , euro zone countries did . 
  do you seriously think that lisbon agreement prohibited countries from giving each other money ? 
  that was a feature , not a bug . 
  greedy politicians wanted to have cheap loans , cheaper than they should have been , so they fudged with the risk factors in basel regulation . 
   the united states and the soviet union negotiated an agreement where that agreement was negotiated ? 
  who negotiated it ? 
  where we can find the text of this agreement or mou ? 
   the first one was to miss the transition from feature phones to smartphones . 
  first nokia smartphone came out in 1996 . 
  nokia problem was that they were ahead of their times , they removed the touch-screen functionality from the symbian s60 smartphones which came out in 2002 . 
  that was because touch screens sucked at that time , you had use stylus . 
  smartphones sold so well in 2000s that nokia management got scared shitless , they were afraid that a better smartphone would cannibalize symbian sales even after iphone had made its debut . 
  nobody wanted to be the man that killed the cash cow . 
  so the board had to hire a torpedo from microsoft to do the dirty work . 
  the greeks did not want to loan from market because they were too expensive . 
  the median income is very low compared to mean income in greece . 
  of course , greece is still pretty rich country , especially compared to eastern europe . 
  i 'm sure all ez countries will be happy to send an occupation force to help . 
  why not , greece will be paying their expenses . 
   seemingly leaves enough room for the penetrator to be the victim any convictions ? 
  i recall sweden had a case with oral sex with male victim in 1990s , do you have similar cases ? 
  in finland , even if wording left amply room for the penetrator to be the victim , courts declared that a forced oral sex was not rape , in other words , only the penetrator had sexual contact with penetrated , not vice versa . 
  the definition was clarified last year . 
  i must admit that eurozone would have hard time to keep straight face if putin signs a check of 2.000.000.000.000 rub to tsipras . 
  krugman conveniently believes anything that imf produces that agrees with his thinking and disbelieves everything that contradicts it . 
  the median income is very low , but that is partially because the tax evasion a very large fraction of greeks do not declare their true income . 
  eurozone can but cheer when obama repudiates the eurozone policy and signs a check of $ 50.000.000.000 to tsipras . 
  according to oecd country report , the most concrete greek reform was allowing shops to keep their doors open for 7 sundays a year . 
   recessions are solved through stimulus . 
  there was a price tag attached to both stimulation and austerity . 
  nothing prevented greece from stimulating , they chose austerity . 
   what i 'd like to know is why out of all those people , 75 % are men . 
  because they are most vulnerable ? 
  ever heard of srebrenica ? 
   are there countries that exclude them in their definition ? 
  england and wales , for instance ? 
   the dutch definition certainly is n't gender-specific either . 
  according to dutch definition , can penetrator be the victim and and penetratee the criminal , like in most rapes of men ? 
  the [ actual criminal code ] ( https://lagen.nu/1962:700#k6p1s1 ) is pretty much [ like in finland ] ( https://www.finlex.fi/sv/laki/ajantasa/1889/18890039001#l20 ) ( note that our legal swedish has been developing separate since 1809 ) . 
  finnish definition is even a bit broader ( allvarlig r\u00e4dsla v. r\u00e4dsla ) . 
  the swedish [ criminal statistics ] ( http://www.bra.se/bra/bra-in-english/home/crime-and-statistics/crime-statistics/statistical-tables.html ) are pretty crude , so i 'm still guessing what might be the difference between finland and sweden . 
   maybe the police effectiveness plays a role here ( decreased number of unreported cases ) swedish police is probably a bit more diligent when filing the reported cases , but i doubt there is 4:1 difference . 
  edit : fixed some borkborkbork, 
  men can be raped in some cases , rape includes cases with unclear consent ( like having consensual sex but without condom might be rape ) . 
  sweden also counts each sexual contact as a separate rape ( just like finland ) . 
   you 'd need  2 % growth which is not possible . 
  why you can not inflate it away ? 
  do you have index-tied loans like sweden ? 
  i 'm pretty sure all the ez leaders are more than happy to let imf to loan some more money to greeks . 
   the only question that matters is `` can the loans be repaid at current debt levels '' , to which the resounding answer is no we need more inflation , mr draghi . 
   a region on the northern part of greece you mean a region in ferog ? 
  zizek seems to think that eurozone is some kind of mafia organization . 
  you can do anything if you can just to talk with capo di tutti capi . 
  he fails to realise that there are some 18 countries in eurozone . 
  tsipras has to convince politicians in each country to cut-cut-cut in their own country so they can give more money to greece . 
  if he wants to do that , he has to promise them blood , tears and sweat of greeks . 
  they mostly read and write , you know , in greek ? 
  a cool font for greek is probably awful for latin , and vice versa ? 
  on my screen , lower-case \u03b1 with accent looks definitely afwul . 
  he had a wand , made of holly , with a phoenix feather core .

  yeah i was here for that , it was ridiculous . 
  personally holed up at inman square . 
  most snowfall i had ever seen in such a short period ( that first week ... ) , which is not what i had expected . 
  living in boston these days . 
  the snowstorms are really epic , but they melt away fast . 
  right now it 's 10c . 
  pretty common for this time of year . 
  the summers are positively mediterranean with july/august seldom dipping below 30 , hovering in the 31-37c window . 
  and this is very far north in the us context . 
  i do n't think i can be warm in finland anymore . 
  hottest day i 've been back there ( 26c ) would have been possibly the coldest day of a typical boston summer . 
  none else made comparable laptops ? 
  i doubt even 25 % of laptops sold were apple . 
  no sensible person ever thought it had . 
  capitalism is like the combustion engine . 
  you should not just hop on the motor and hop for the best . 
  yet abandoning it would be ridiculous . 
  but a strong eu is a major us ally that allows us to focus most of its military attention on china . 
  the ultimate populist coup will be going all solar and making the saudis pay for it ( by confiscating all their money abroad ) . 
  someone pitching this will be very popular and the gulf countries ( esp sa ) will have a real hard time hiding their wealth from the western banking system ( especially considering the fact that russia and china might also confiscate it , if west was for it ) . 
  where can you invest $ 2trn ? 
  oil is getting less relevant by the day . 
  temporary border controls do not risk western values in any meaningful way . 
  and i btw agree , this extremism is the death throes of islam . 
  secular humanism delivers happiness to the populations and they are waking up to it ( bin laden was most upset about the godlessness on the arabian peninsula ) . 
  so the religious are worried and fight back . 
  that said , this process is far from over . 
  at the very least 15 more years , and quite possibly a century ( though that is a real dark timeline ) . 
  one could point out that some terrorism might have occurred before b&b went to war . 
  and most hate in history , has unfortunately been dampened with bleeding . 
  either excessively on one side or profusely on both sides ( see germany & france ) . 
  few go away with old age . 
  some go away with mere humiliation . 
  islam backed down from europe when it realized the ottoman empire could only lose those wars and be destabilize in the process . 
  in that sense we should encourage a caliphate that would have leaders who we could really threaten . 
  or maybe we just need to lop the main head off the snake in saudi-arabia . 
   short of wiping the region out with atomic bombs and killing every man , woman and child , you ca n't win that war you can leave some alive surely , having 500,000 floating about wo n't be that big a deal . 
  zoroastrian terror threat just is n't that high . 
   i genuinely do n't know what the best course of action is here ... and we have got bush and blair to thank for that !, 
  you 're claiming islamism is their fucking fault ? 
  that 's ridiculous . 
  they had a chance to fix this with a lot of political support in 2001 , but it was a hard problem already then and them succeeding fully would have been insanely impressive . 
  they failed harder than they should have admittedly , but blaming them is still ridiculous . 
  give the fucking crowd in the middle east some agency will ya ? 
  but a hell of a lot better than waiting longer and then going extreme right wing on even more issues . 
  you can vote for `` lets risk literally hitler by holding out for 4-5 more years of this '' or give in to some concerns right now . 
  i 'm not super happy about it , but it 's insanity to risk a truly terrifying government coming in at some point when people have truly had enough . 
  hmm , no ? 
  or a fuck ton of girls were dying their hair like crazy young in grade school, 
  it 's bit of a mouthful . 
  also , i am definitely not in that category as i have 2x graduate degrees and net worth in the hundreds of thousands ( with the double degrees ) around age 35 . 
  i just really can not stomach religion in politics which kept making republicans just impossible for me to vote ( not that i voted for trump , but i like the evangelicals irrelevance opening up a party for me potentially ), 
  still , what would you consider these clearly new people to the republican party that can be younger , were quite often blue collar , are not particularly religious etc ? 
  and please do n't be ridiculous and call them racists . 
  i know a number myself , and none are racists . 
  shit , i am decidedly right leaning person who can not stand religion in politics . 
  i always felt a mild affinity with the alternative right , even with its crazies ( just like i feel a degree of affinity with the greens over global warming , even though there are tons of completely bonkers people under the green umbrella ), 
  i have seen various versions of `` alt-right '' , one of which is that it is simply a right wing group that does not give a shit about the evangelicals , something that has been considered pretty much mandatory in the us right wing . 
  milo is in a way a great example of this because he is definitely not someone that the evangelicals would approve of . 
  sure , there are racist elements , but i do not feel they tarnish the whole thing . 
  i rather like the idea of republicans where the evangelicals are not very important . 
  good point . 
  when life was so bad we could not stay alive long enough to wage war , we had no war . 
  in other news , a nuclear holocaust would quite possibly prevent ww4 for at least 100 years, 
  it 's just a tradition that you create your own monsters . 
  any billionaire thinking he can own and control something as ambitious as a politician is insane . 
  it 's like riding a lion and hoping that it 's grateful that you fed it when it was young . 
  it does n't * actually * owe you a fucking thing , and if it happens to be hungry ... well ... 
  gratitude has a short shelf life . 
  well , in a way not corrupt , or double corrupt . 
  if gaddafi was supposed to get something other than bombed for that investment , sarkozy certainly did not deliver . 
  hell , he was the main person driving the bombing campaign ... buying politicians is n't that easy it turns out . 
   you can say the democrats majorly fucked up their campaign ( duh ) but to say that these people is some fringe minority is crazy . 
  the ones that cry ? 
  yea , they 're pretty damn fringe . 
  in my close proximity ( ~ 30 people i interact with frequently ) there 's maybe 1 person that voted for trump , 29 that voted for hillary , and 0 people that cried . 
  the extreme sjw fringe . 
  i consider myself a liberal ( 100 % in the classical sense , maybe 54 % in the american one ) and i have no love for them . 
  saying this is modern liberalism is like saying all conservatives just engage in meme wars . 
  i have to agree though , seeing these people cry is insanely satisfying and the best thing about a trump victory ( no , i did not vote for him ) . 
  it is amazing how they think they are so progressive and great for everyone while they might be the most hated group in the west ( i bet they poll lower than devout muslims , who are not at the peak of their popularity either ), 
  true enough in a sense , but there 's a case to be said about relevance and activity levels . 
  sure , hardcore christians and jews can find some really fucked up stuff in their books too , but they seldom do , and they 're pretty rare to begin with . 
  lord knows the mainstream does n't even tacitly accept any truly religious arguments except the flirting with life beginning at conception and what that might mean ( not too malevolent ) . 
  but my point about relevance : islam is the only one fighting right now with over 50 million adherents . 
  and it has nearly 2 billion . 
  so yea . 
  it 's like saying kali worshippers were just as horrible as the nazis . 
  maybe , maybe . 
  but one of them was hanging around in a few small areas of india and the others were flirting with having enough power to take over the world . 
  even if the density of the problem among individuals is similar , the numbers game matters . 
  the apostasy laws in muslim countries do hideous pr for islam , and rightly so . 
  i ** will ** hold that against islam , because it 's the only religion to go that far , and the enforce it and have popular support for it . 
  i can hold it against islam just like people can hold donald trump , the war on drugs etc against the us . 
  it 's quite different from blaming every individual , but it 's fair enough to say there 's something rotten in the institution . 
  alas it is n't just the person . 
  the extended family can swing meaningful influence too . 
  source : had a cousin dating a cool muslim guy . 
  things * changed * at one point due to the family . 
  yeah that has been my experience too .

i was going to say what a lightweight since it 's 55 % or nothing for me but than figured it was n't the most appropraite turn of phrase, 
  haha , i guess russia does n't like finnish butter though . 
  can we stop upvoting this euromaidan ** pr ** it 's not news or factual but hard propaganda, 
  so much so i even hear poland is a sucker for blowjobs, 
  you do know the americans authorised `` first strike '' as well . 
   ** for nuclear weapons states and non-compliant states : **  the u.s. would use nuclear weapons only in extreme circumstances to defend the vital interests of the united states http://www.webcitation.org/6fy0ol07h es , our allies and partners, 
  that sucks so bad , reminds me how i ran up 100 euro 's of an overuse bill while i was just home for the christmas period . 
  government is a joke , if they had any balls they would force these companies to provide unlimited use contracts but unforunately they bow doen to big business every time . 
  the only two countrys i can think that operate data useage caps are ireland and the usa and we all know how backward the latter has become . 
   52 $ / month wow , i pay $ 15/mont for the same cable deal with saunalahti cable, 
  wow , i guess they still got that `` 3 '' national broadband scam going where they got paid shitloads to provide coverage for the whole country but save money on infrastructure by rationing everyones use with a data cap . 
  that was my one of my last straws before moving to finland . 
  the first day was 20 open tabs streaming porn at once i tells you . 
  good i wish the eu would do the same an we could all be better off . 
  let ukraine sit in their own stew, 
  i 've heard it said , bird pooping on you means good luck is on it 's way . 
  a russian who posts 90 % of the time in / r/ukraina / i 've heard it all now, 
  why do you wear russian flag flair when you are clearly ukranian . 
  worst attempt at psy-op 's ever by the looks of it . 
  `` hey look i 'm russian and disagree so something something putin hulio ... ... ! '', 
  yes and every few years the irs settles with an agreement to only tax x % on profits repatriated . 
  yes only now the us is starting to give out after whole corporations decided to reincorporate as irish and pay all ( or more likely zero ) tax there but while ireland was operating as a doorwar for american corporations to operate in europe and funnell the money back home it was all good . 
   and how are these things the us/europe pushing ireland around ? 
  i did n't say they are pushing them around , i said ireland does as they are told like rushing through rush legislation to make bank debt to sovereign debt at the request of the eu . 
  nope i work in it / software development with 10 years experience at this point , could easily have a job in ireland but i disagree with the bailout/politics and general status of `` us vassal state '' ireland has become to the point i said fuck this shit and left . 
  sorry to say but ireland has no backbone as a country and nobody with foresight thinking 5/10 years ahead while our politicians barely succeed at managing the present privatization and sell-off of state assets . 
  as soon as we got rid of the british we just copied their judicial system and started doing as we were told by the us/europe to the point our neutrality does n't exist anymore . 
  there was never any brand ireland , if we were n't so backward thinking we could have a real tech boom since we are perfectly located for data centers but that takes cheaper ( nuclear/hydro ) power . 
  then you have our squandered gas reserves ... * now i 'm starting to rant * but i see no future there , jobs being created on the basis of being a tax haven and no development of infrastructure which is not sustainable and that 's before the debt, 
  i totally agree although i left ireland because of that bullshit attitude of laying down for the us and i fear many others who care might have done the same, 
  it 's still wrong and propaganda but i should expect no less from a guy called pladmir_vutin who posts pro-ukranian articles all day, 
  in that case just marked it to watch later on . 
  i sure hope so, 
  something something , slavic women, 
  i ca n't watch 40 minutes now , any chance of a tl , dr i did however watch this one called `` flipping out '' which shows the drug fueled year off conscripts go on in india and other cheaper non muslim regions of the world . 
  spoiled brats getting fucked up to help their self inflicted ptsd was the only thought that came to mind . 
  http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xkbwbk_flipping-out-israel-s-drug-generation_lifestyle unless it turns out they are all brainwashed i do n't think i 'll be gaining any sympathy for the idf, 
  another version of ths video is titled `` huge rebel armored vehicle column driving through rovenky '' who is telling the truth . 
  sorry to hear things are that bad . 
  sounds like my version of hell . 
  do you think these are the type of people we want in europe ? 
  i do n't know about the young generation but i always feel the old types need o die off before any country can really change it 's ways . 
  these guys are the perfect example, 
  or we would just edcuate people to not have so many kids . 
  it 's not like feeding the ever exploding population is good for our planet in long term anyway, 
   it seems like many europeans do n't understand we are still locked in an ideological war against an alliance of authoritarian post-soviet states you just never stop with the red threat fearmongering do you, 
   did you know this site has an actual subreddit for farming , where actual farmers will tell you many of them are happy with monsanto products ? 
  you mean the subreddit 's full of monsanto shills searching reddit 24/7 for any opportunity to defend their beloved company, 
  russia wins again, 
  best britain, 
  you are such a propagandist , good thing i got that article of yours in worldnews removed . 
  i 'm going to make a point in following you around now and keeping tabs on rule violations, 
  i suggest you search `` worthy and unworthy victims '' by chomsky this is just hte media building outrage to use as political capital against russia . 
  frankly i find it appauling but everyone seems to lap it up and worst thing is it works too . 
  this is how they start wars, 
  oh wait now i get it  redditor for 1 month comment history entirely full of anti-russian posts . 
  guess you just came on here today to use a disaster to selfishly push your own agenda, 
  why are your replies so rude and off the point , you sound like a rambling drunk unable to address anything i say, 
   do you speak russian or you 're just a useful idiot ? 
  no need for the ad hominem is there buddy . 
  why would i speak russian when you can clearly see i am speaking english . 
  are you seriously trying to tell me the ukraine not not lied in the past . 
  i 'm only quoting one of the more hilarious cases where they made up some elaborate story to cover their air strike that killed a load of civilians . 
  point being they have not earned our trust, 
  i agree but the language used is unprecidented in my opinion and seems to be designed more to fuel hate . 
  the guardian for example `` mh17 : armed rebels fuel chaos as rotting corpses pile up on the roadside '' i fully get they are trying to illiustrate the point but how is that sort of headline taking into account the mourning of those familys who are not presented a mental image of loved one as a rotting corpse, 
  typical redditor `` botson bomber lynchmob '' and it 's also being fueled by western media right now with the language they are using . 
  in all reports now about this plane crash we hear strong words appealing to emotion like `` rotting corpses piled up on a roadside '' and to put this in context you will notice the equal number of deaths in gaza get no such language used . 
  noam chomsky 's piece from manufacturing consent on `` worthy and unworthy victims '' piece will open your eyes to this sort of thing and i cant help but feel it 's designed to demonize russia and russians in the eyes of the audience, 
  i just posted about this in the thread where they are asking `` ordinary russians '' about how they see the state . 
  people can cry and say , well they are just presenting fact etc etc but when you ask leading questions and have the opportunity to only publish the replies that suit your own agenda it 's just as likely to be full blown propaganda . 
  just so everyone knows , radio liberty was a setup by the cia as a cold war propaganda platform . 
  before the insta downvotes , it 's well documented http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/radio_free_europe/radio_liberty, 
  agreed, 
  great quote but i agree 100 % . 
  small states like ireland and finland need to always play both sides or risk being dominated by one or another . 
  right not both have lost their sovereignty and have been pretty much absorbed by the usa/eu west although i feel it 's pity he chose to cosy up with another power structure known as the church and helped destroy the socialist movement in ireland in his days, 
  well that 's how you see but i tend to respect what esko aho ( link to him discussing ukraine and current fin-rus relations https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vmkyakc3sc ) has to say here in that small countries should not be playing politics anyway and accept that they must be molded by the stronger powers around them . 
  there should be no `` sides '' in this and to think we are no longer reliant on russia is foolish at best , finland should simply do what 's best for finland the natural gas power plant next to my house which gives me hot water and electricity does ' t get that gas from fairies or do you have a better solution for our heating an electricity needs ? 
  these borderline neo-con capitalists in helsinki these days seems to have no idea off the past, 
  policy all through the soviet era called to say they disagree, 
  assuming you trust ukraine did n't lie about it all . 
  how many times have they claimed rebels blew themselves up by now i wonder ? 
  so all of a sudden we trust ukrainian after all the lies and half truths . 
  and lets not forget the whole rebel manpad striking an air conditioner incident and blowing themselves up incident, 
  i will grow a lot more once the imf get their teeth in, 
  and that is why finland should do as she has always done as a small country and keep her head down and not take sides at all, 
  going well in iraq is n't it . 
  such american support, 
  oh yes of course , mother germany must be repaid . 
  10/10 , would annex, 
  what , the battle against factual titles ? 
  the `` back to russia '' part, 
  zerohedge is a pretty well know site, 
  such fact 's , many wow . 
  care to elaborate on where you got your intel ? 
  i think to think logically like you just did there as well because this has happened before and nothing came of it . 
  it just surprized me how the reddit hivemind gets themselves so whipped up lets hope someone does n't come out with some crazy evidence like the boston bombings shitstorm . 
  i hate to whatabout but would people really be as outraged if isis used captured american tech from iraq/syrian rebels to do the same thing ? 
  ... because they keep fighting the rebels and wont just agree to let them seperate not because he thinks they did it .

  chairman of the finnish islamic council anas hajjar has estimated that in finland lives 65 000 muslims . 
  maybe more now . 
  `` resembles a voice that can be hear when a finn puts a finger on their lips and whispers ` hush quiet ' '' the pigs are apparently too noisy ... 
  but now that i listen it from youtube it does sound a bit like `` aah hiljaa ! '', 
  everyone who starts to study russian here is apparently afraid of \u0441 , \u0437 , \u0448 , \u0436 , \u0446 , \u0447 , and \u0449 . 
  they are also one of the main reasons why people give up the language . 
  people just do n't hear any difference between them . 
  [ every learn language site has something about them ] ( http://info.edu.turku.fi/most/tutustuminen/suhinat.htm ), 
  [ a comic about those virgins ... ] ( http://www.hs.fi/fingerpori/s1349781084155 ), 
  hm ... unfortunately finns do n't lack of facial hair , 83 % are n't lactose intolerant , but the firewater part may be true . 
  we have been in trouble already for years . 
  and they have n't even started their austerity program yet . 
  subtitles are wrong . 
  he said : `` this food is too bad even for a dog . 
  this is for women a problem . 
  problem . '', 
  or something like that . 
  i think it was from that finnish food strike . 
  but he said it 's not for even dogs , and their women do n't like it . 
  they wanted money and a kitchen to make their own food . 
  -6 celsius in november is perfectly normal . 
  and it 's been unusually warm anyway . 
  but this is the month when some people usually get seasonal affective disorder ( winter depression ) . 
  sad is measurably present at latitudes in the arctic region , such as northern finland ( 64 \u00b0 00 \u2032 n ) where the rate of sad is 9.5 % ( because no sun ) . 
  when finns say they are going to travel to europe , they usually mean france , germany or maybe italy . 
  sometimes poland . 
  all the other countries are called by their names . 
  it 's possible . 
  although we have a last name `` suomalainen '' ( finnish ) , too , and not all the finns are called that . 
  is it after river neva ? 
  i mean , neva is one of the many words for swamp in finnish . 
  ruotsalainen ( swedish ) , ven\u00e4l\u00e4inen ( russian ) , and virolainen ( estonian ) are quite common last names . 
  edit : and maybe juutilainen , which means the jutes . 
  is it a mistake ? 
  in 2006 \u00c5land was the 20th wealthiest of the eu 's 268 regions , and the wealthiest in finland . 
  no , it 's about social welfare and healt care reform . 
  politicians have argued about it for years . 
  there is already finnmark , it 's part of norway . 
  he belongs to that pacman camp . 
  then there are at least one priest , one english teacher , lawyer , and a woman whose name nobody remembers and who has been quiet lately . 
  and some others who are n't so noisy . 
  cute . 
  this is like finland m\u00e4n again . 
  boats are also called `` paatti '' in finnish , but `` vene '' is the official word . 
  that 's why venemaa sounds funny , boat land ... 
  does it mean a russian village ( like in venemaa ) or a boat village like it sounds in finnish ? 
  does `` vene '' even mean a boat in estonian ? 
  karelians who live next to finland are language relatives of the finns ( finnish karelians speak a karelian dialect of finnish , not a different language like russian karelians ) . 
  but if i remember correct , today only 7 % of the karelians are actually ethnic karelians , and even less speak karelian , the rest are ethnic russians . 
  so i 'm not sure do they differ from the rest of russia that much . 
  some other refugees already said that going to strike because of food was stupid . 
  they admited that they also think it 's not very tasty , too bland , but that tantrum did n't make any sense . 
  no , they wo n't get an asylum , job seeking is be a completely different process . 
  even we have two other similar holidays , easter and st. knut 's day in western finland ( where easter witches are almost unknown ) . 
  russians are one of the biggest group who apply for asylum here . 
  chechens , russian sexual minorities , but also russians who tell their reason to apply for asylum is that they are afraid someone will steal their money if they stay in russia , or they are looking for a job . 
  we are going to make it harder for iraqis . 
  we get them from sweden because sweden would send them back to safe areas of iraq . 
  and if sweden thinks there is safe enough for them ... well , i trust them . 
  3200 is just the eu quota , we still get 100-500 iraqis a day through sweden ( not as many as there used to be ) . 
  i just read we will get ( or maybe they are already here ) 50 eritrean asylum seekers from italy today . 
  the total amount will be 3200 . 
  they are still keeping most of them . 
  that 's true . 
  there are three different sami groups in finland ( their languages are n't mutually intelligible with each other ) . 
  the biggest group is doing ok , but the situation with the two smaller language groups is different , especially if people keep moving to south , separating from each other . 
  sometimes they feel they do n't belong to anywhere ; in russia they are finns and in finland russians . 
  very simplified version : if both of the brown eyed parents have blue eyed ancestors , it 's possible for their child to have blue eyes . 
  `` recessive traits like blue eyes can lie dormant in the genes for hundreds of years waiting for the chance to awaken and be seen . 
  that chance comes when two carriers come together and have children . '', 
  estonian , russian - other - ? 
  i think it 's called sea lion because the cable will be in the sea and a lion is a common heraldic animal of finland . 
  nobody remembers names of all old invasion plans , or would people know why `` fir east '' would make some people to raise their eyebrows here ? 
  doctors are recommending more vitamin d even for us , but the darker your skin is the more you should eat the vitamin during winters . 
  and if you do n't drink milk ( added vitamin d so that we would get more of it ) , you need to eat those pills even more . 
  this is what happened here when the social services believed what the father told to them and they gave his girl back to him and his girlfriend : `` eight year old vilja eerika died of suffocation in helsinki after a long-term assault and battery on mother 's day of 2012 . 
  the father of the child and his girlfriend were sentenced for life . 
  the girl had suffered daily torture , humiliation , violence , and deprivation of liberty . 
  she had 89 marks of abuse on her body when she died . '', 
  i do n't even want to descripe how she died , but even after her death the father and his girlfriend denied they had ever tried to harm or kill her , they were just trying to teach her to behave . 
  the social services got all the blame because they had n't acted even when several people - including the girl 's mother who had given up the custody of her because she had problems with alcohol - had reported about the guardians . 
  when the girl was asked where she got bruises , she just said `` i do n't know '' , sometimes they were from her hobbies . 
  the social services said the reason was that they are overwhelmed , and it 's impossible to help every child in need if they do n't get more resources . 
  ( they were both finnish , at first it was believed that the girlfriend was a franco-moroccan doctor because she told that to everybody , but in investigations she turned out to be a seriously mentally ill finn , and not a doctor . 
  the father was described as a really nice man who had a warm relation with his daughter . ), 
  * i 'm not saying the mother is lying in this case * , but their job is really hard . 
  they need to decide when it 's nothing serious and when it 's the real case . 
  i had already written street , and i was too lazy to fix it ... 
  you mean those swedish experts who have angrily told to us since that happened , that there are enough room for millions of refugees in finnish forests ? 
  nobody wants to live in a forest ... 
  there are so many theories about where finns came from that nobody knows which of them are true , here is some more recent information if someone is interested : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/finns#genetics http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/05/150511095358.htm, 
  maybe some of them think christians from their region are traitors , but for outsiders it 's mostly ok because they are strange anyway ? 
  rantatie ( coast street ) , kirkkotie ( church street ) , koulutie ( school street ) , myllytie ( mill street ) , rinnetie ( slope street ) etc. 
  these are the most common . 
  better translation for `` tie '' could be just road . 
  hm , i 'm pretty sure we have more than one completely nutcase nationalist here , and there 's not much that can be done about it . 
  i just meant that the title made me think this has happened again but this time there were a lot of people in kkk uniforms . 
  when i saw this i thought they did that again , and this time there were many of them . 
  this happened already a week ago , and there was only one person who was wearing that kkk uniform . 
  `` when i recently asked one of the very few syrians i met in oslo why he had chosen norway , he said , ' i thought oslo was in sweden . ' '',

well these are questions instead of the usual a country is something . 
  finland used to look like a woman but we lost the other arm and some of the dress in wwii . 
  if every woman chose not to have a child it would be a bigger disaster for the country than if there was no army . 
  that obviously would never happen but women are already performing a service for the country that is nessecary . 
  and the goverment had been pushing people to have more children besides . 
  and no matter how good the job opportinities are comparing internationally it is not like staying out of the workforce for a pretty long time has a positive impact for your career . 
  but since women already have to have children for the nation which bacically takes the same about of time of your life and you loose job oprotunities and pregnancy can be risky it would be like having women serve the country twice . 
  the number in this poll is reported with more detail than usual , usually they are just asking how many people are opposed and it has been 65-50 % the entire time i have been reading news ( i am in my 20s ) . 
  so nothing new , i do not know what finnish redditors have been posting . 
  probably there is lots of young men here that are more pro-nato , women expecially are very anti-nato . 
  this is nothing new , russia has always acted like this regarding finland joining nato . 
  it is bacically the continuation of soviet union disliking when finland were joining different european organizations , it was just the 90s when russia was more relaxed . 
  so it is not really about reality they just hate the possibility . 
  finns usually are good with grammar and maybe chinese just do not hear the horrible accents . 
  could someone make a collection for all countries , i never find these post with search and it would be fun to see all the things said about one country at once . 
  am i the only one who likes belarus ? 
  the alternative looks so boring in comparison as well . 
  creationism is not harming anyone . 
  i believe it is alicia vikander 's character who is the danish girl . 
  it is sad how many old buildings were demolished . 
  and now makkaratalo is protected , so rediculous . 
  i have always hated how tapiola 's crurch looks , did not realise these kind of crurches were a plague in our country . 
  hopefully the rest look better inside than tapiola 's does . 
  they might have been living there but the just called the place a generic term like village instead of having an actual name since back then people did not move a lot ( so people would not maybe ever see another village ) . 
  and there were no written texts and did not need separate names for places and there were no finnish towns before the swedes came , in my knowledge . 
  the cities actually were often named long after the cities had the swedish names so the swedish name was the only one and not just the official one . 
  but most cities were originally named in swedish . 
  i do not think politicians should only answer yes or no to difficult issues . 
  often the people do not know unless having more information of the subject . 
  and if they answer in a way to something but later change their lines people will politically always go back to the original statement that could have been made in a different circumstances . 
  however if he never answers yes or no it is a problem . 
  but not of he does is sometimes . 
  many non-violent rapes occur because the victims or too frightned to fight back since they think they will be killed if they do , and in other cases the rapist makes the victim belive this was their fault/not rape at all so they do not fight back . 
  i would think those could result in worse physological damages since they could get permanently mentaly affected by the fear or the guilt . 
  nobody who knows about holocaust would think after hearing polish death camp that it refers to polish involvement . 
  but people who do not know much about the holocaust such as children , people from countries with less education anf people from in the future if holocaust is well known would think that polish were working with nazis if the term polish death camp is used . 
  i assumed kuningas came form konung somehow but it apparently comes from the original root directly . 
  the president has no say in actual decisons . 
  well he might not get re-elected if he is too controversial . 
  but yes , otherwise he has nothing to lose if he says anything . 
  well he was already lked even when he was actually involved in politics , even if not as much . 
  after recent law changes president bacically does not have any real power . 
  the president still had some after the constitution change in 2000 , but the last of the powers were removed in the change of 2012 . 
  but cant ' t the husbands be occasionally minors as well and it is a case of a arranged child marriage ? 
  those happen as well but i do not know how often , engagement are more common . 
  i believe the older generations were often taught german as third language if they learned a third one ( the second language would be the mandatory swedish ) . 
  finland always looks like that in these comics . 
  this is not about norway and finland being unified in the past . 
  there is just a petition in facebook that wants to give the peak of a mountain to finland . 
  the peak would be the highest spot in finland if finland were to get it . 
  finland already owns most of the mountain , norway and finland share a border . 
  this probably will not happen btw . 
  but it would be fun . 
  regarding which countries finland and norway used to belong to . 
  back in the days of kalmar union in the middle ages all the nordic countries were technically united but that does not really count . 
  otherwise finland was part of sweden for 600 years until the early 19th century when russia conquered finland . 
  finland was an autonomous part of russia for 90 years and then gained independence 1917 . 
  norway was independent at some point in the past i believe but from the middle ages on was part of denmark until in the early 19th century sweden got it ( so during the napoleonic wars sweden lost finland but gained norway ) . 
  norway became independent in 1905 . 
  how could you watch the video if you are in finland ? 
  i am in finland and can not watch it . 
  lots of fish and potatoes . 
  all the basic foods with not much special ways to prepare them , nothing special . 
  except the christmas food , can not wait for christmas . 
  well if you do know that eu has something between 26 and 29 member countries and you would know every one if you bothered to take some time and count it is kind of trivia that you do not remember the correct number . 
  besides when the number is high enough it is hard to humans remember everything . 
  just look at countries of the world quizz at sporcle ( or was it some other quizz ? ), 
  or the states in us and see the presentabele of people who answered correctly . 
  that wound hurt the tourism of estonia , a lot of people go to tallinn for a weekend and used hotels and restaurants and stuff . 
  then again i am sure some some people form estonia are so fed up by drinking finns they could be begging for a solution like this ... 
  so the people who are trying to resale are will get caught . 
  if you say the amount you are bringing is for next 5 years you could much larger amounts are just for personal use . 
  well it might be partially because we keep saying that finland is not in scandinavia and people get confused ... 
  do children in another countries draw flags on independence day ? 
  when i was a kid we felt sorry for kids in other countries that had difficult flags , portugal being one often mentioned with that symbol in the middle . 
  i am from finland so it is just a blue cross so it is easy , so maybe that is why we did that as kids . 
  people are afraid an eu army would mean getting involved in other wars . 
  but that is kind of a risk we need to take . 
  but there should be a campaining for just a defensive force and nothing more , i know people would not nessecarily believe that but still . 
  poland is ok . just look at us , do people think another war with russia would go like winter war . 
  pretty much all of russian 's neighbours have to an extent . 
  well there is a question mark this time . 
  suomi is what we call finland in finnish or suomeksi . 
  just look at the flair of the poster you responded to . 
  but i think there is actually linguistic depate where word suomi comes from . 
  and linguistic depate where finland comes from . 
  but suomi sounds like it comes from suomaa to me but who knows . 
  i would imagine that using two pairs of tires makes them last longer . 
  one thing to keep in mind is that in finland are designed to keep in heat . 
  and it takes time for bodies to adjust to higher temperatures . 
  the walkways are salted and/or have gravel in cities so you could not even if you wanted to . 
  who knows about the country folk . 
  if trump is not elected people stop laughing at america 's politics pretty soon while brexit is a thing for years . 
  however if trump is elected ... 
  you really think it will not melt ? 
  i am negative and think it will melt and snow again many times and there will be ice and wet everywhere and no snow on christmas . 
  russia could be worried nato would use finland as a base of operations anyway . 
  people do not think russia would start a war against finland alone but it would be a part of some other operations . 
  well democracy is the best style of government but the fact that people can so easily change their minds if there is no quick results is lone of the flaws . 
  romantic films do not mean bad .

  finland has two expensive finnish supermarket chains that dominate , and lidl has about 8 % market share ( rising about 1 % per year ) . 
  lidl in finland also realized , they do n't need to set very cheap prices , just about 20 % cheaper than the finnish chains . 
  more lidl and cheaper food to finland , bitte sch\u00f6n . 
   why do you keep voting in parties that make your lives more miserable ? 
  not very responsible yes , you should vote for parties that promise to make everyone rich by taking a lot of national debt . 
  that would be responsible . 
   i think she 's gone too far this time in terms of cracking the whip . 
  if uk was in the eurozone , you would have been more lenient in giving greece more money ? 
  have you seen [ kung fury ] ( https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=bs5p_laqivg ) ? 
   why not blame your leaders finland is a small country with a long border with russia . 
  we want to stay friends with the big european countries ( and also with usa ) in case we some day need some sympathy . 
  so if germany and france decide we pay , then we pay . 
   why are you paying to bail out foreign banks in addition to above , if we did n't help greece to bail out the loans they are currently unable to pay , greece would default and their situation would get even worse . 
  it is not nice that finland ends up contributing approx . 
  1000 $ per person ( in total , starting from 2010 bailout ) , because people could use that money at home . 
  but if that helps prevent chaos in greece , maybe there is this positive side to it . 
  it was mostly french and german banks . 
  i guess france and germany prefer that every country in the eurozone pays , instead of only france and germany paying to bail out their own banks . 
  or , if you are asking , why to bail out banks in general , i do n't know , but usa did that too in 2008 , so maybe for the same reason . 
  or if you are asking why finland agrees to whatever germany and france tell us to do , finland is too small to have the courage to disagree . 
   when 89 % go to the banks , do n't talk about how much money i get . 
  would you think that it would be better if the eu would not give greece that money , which then goes to banks ? 
  there already was * [ first economic adjustment programme for greece ( 2010 ) ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/first_economic_adjustment_programme_for_greece ) * [ second economic adjustment programme for greece ( 2012 ) ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/second_economic_adjustment_programme_for_greece ) and now 2015 is the third . 
   i blame it on the eu how much money would you want to get , so that you would not blame anybody ? 
   for example , if you export a lot outside the eu and the euro is very strong , that will hurt you more in theory , a whole country could agree to lower peoples ' salaries , which would achieve the same goal as currency devaluation . 
  in practice , such an agreement is more difficult for the politicians to do , than to simply decide about devaluation . 
   the ship is already sinking . 
  there will be more ships . 
   failing to find any acceptable solutions to the problem maybe there are no solutions to the problem , that would be generally acceptable . 
  after some googling ... yes , it seems to be a thing . 
   the weakening of france compared to germany is bad news . 
  the next time russia flexes its muscles , we 'll just be happy if we have strong germany . 
  if you are hoping to borrow another 50 euros from him , better not to tell him fuck you . 
   raw sticks of butter is it possible to cook a stick of butter ? 
   such drama . 
  many politics !, 
   it wo n't get greece out of the hole . 
  do you have a recipe that would ? 
  ( does anyone ? ), 
   slovenia , latvia , estonia and lithuania who are considerably poorer than greece already . 
  and also finland . 
  we are not ( yet anyway ) poorer than greece . 
  some people want more tight european union , and some people want less european union . 
  people in every eu country are divided on this question . 
   are you 12 years old ? 
  and even if you are , do n't tell that to any / u/catholic _ extremist, 
  who 's to say they could not create a union by taking over one country at a time ? 
   can actually pay it back username checks out , / u/cluelessperson, 
   i 'm a federalist , but this is honestly making me doubt the eu , it 's a hostile takeover of a country was n't the point of the union to take political power away from individual countries , to the eu ? 
   but it 's worth keeping in mind who decides what that fiscal policy is . 
  well , it has to start with small steps ? 
   finland 's economy is suffering because they have to use the euro the euro has prevented finland to simply use currency devaluation to improve economic competitiveness . 
  but germany achieved the same by freezing or even decreasing people 's salaries . 
  finland 's previous government did n't do this ( or much anything ) because the were the most inefficient government in finnish history , but the current government is trying to do this . 
  who know , maybe they 'll even succeed . 
  maybe i am reading wrong what people have been writing in this thread , but as far as i have understood , they want transfer union without the common fiscal policy part . 
  ( `` give us more money , but do n't tell us how to spend it . '' ), 
   germany would end up subsidizing greece and co. under such an arrangement , and they absolutely do n't want that . 
  and countries would surrender a part of their sovereign decision making to the eu . 
  but this whole thread is about how , when it is suggested that greece surrenders some , people are against that . 
   a transfer union like the us a transfer union with unified fiscal policy . 
  and now that a unified fiscal policy is suggested to greece , everybody loses their minds . 
  a transfer union without unified fiscal policy will not work . 
  no , a common fiscal policy , like in the usa . 
   fiscal transfers fiscal transfers alone will not suffice , there needs to be a common fiscal policy . 
  this means individual countries surrendering their fiscal policy to the eu . 
   all i got from this was they set fire to a castle ? 
  that sounds kind of awesome honestly how did you feel about the 9/11 ? 
   so if someone burned down the statue of liberty or , you know , the wtc ... 
   latvia to me is just some old ex-soviet republic that is not a very nice thing to say . 
  they are a nice country , fast improving their economy and quality of life , and it is somewhat rude to label them based on their unfortunate history .

   helena eronen i do n't think helena eronen has ever belonged to the perussuomalaiset party . 
  i was trying to say i checked the first two quotes , and those people did n't get elected . 
  not even close . 
  [ gypsy child thieves ( bbc documentary ) ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thinoddvvmq ), 
   would you say those views are typical of members of the party ? 
  the party has grown so fast , and has lots of internal disagreements , so it 's not so easy to even find out what are the typical members of the party . 
   is this site real or trolling ? 
  truefinns quotes probably real . 
  but those quotes are from people from small towns who are `` politicians '' only in the sense that they were running ( not necessarily got elected ) to their town councils . 
  for example the [ guy from the first quote ] ( https://fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/klaus_elovaara ) ran in the parliament elections in 2007 and got a whopping 126 votes ( a tiny amount , really ) , and was kicked out of the party in 2011 . 
  the second quote is from someone who was running for a town council of a [ small town of 25 000 people ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sastamala ) and [ did n't get elected ] ( http://www.sastamalankaupunki.fi/sivu.tmpl?sivu_id=6840 ) . 
  i am sure each country has their share of this kind of fringe politicians . 
  here is some less radical news , minister of finance [ alexander stubb says ] ( http://yle.fi/uutiset/stubb_kreikka_ei_ole_saamassa_lisalainaa__toimet_eivat_riita/8148807 ) that ( a ) finland is not the only country that is not wanting to give more money to greece , and ( b ) the government is not about to collapse . 
  the news about this situation change so quickly , it is difficult to know what to believe . 
   i was 14 back then and i didnt even know why my parents and i have to suffer for things we arent responsible for . 
  i want to thank you for giving your perspective . 
  however , you need to realize , that [ greece has been living on other countries ' money ] ( http://financemymoney.com/greece-debt-to-gdp-ratio-200-percent-the-crisis-is-of-solvency-and-not-liquidity/ ) basically from 1980 onwards . 
  you are not responsible for this situation , but also the other people in other countries that have been giving you money for last 25 years , are not responsible . 
  they are not obliged to continue giving you money , and if they decide to stop giving you money , you just have to deal with it , and start living at a rate you can afford . 
   they want us to suffer , to lower our standard of life they do n't want you to suffer , they just want to stop giving you money . 
  it 's their money and they want to use it themselves . 
  just like you would . 
  it is a sad situation that your standard of life has been build upon borrowed money for 25 years . 
  and it is sad that your politicians and your media has lied to you about this . 
  but you can not keep on living on borrowed money forever . 
  i do n't think offers from russia were ever beneficial to anyone , except maybe russia . 
   a lot of hate from finland we lost nokia and our economy is not doing very well , and our new goverment is trying to reduce taking new debt , so people are afraid that the quality of life is going down . 
  so the idea of giving money to someone else , when we feel that we are ourselves running out of money , is not popular .

  most x-rays with no wait are way less than 100 $ . 
  surgeries are in different scale - but most of their costs are still covered by the national subvention . 
  so for a working person , i 'd say we have a plan on par with the ones offered by companies in the states . 
  the difference is for the uninsured , for who 'm there is the possibility to use no/low-cost public healthcare , which is often much more crowded and one could end up waiting for non-acute surgery for several months . 
  but to compare that to a full private system , would those people even receive treatment or could they afford it if it was available ? 
  it 's not perfect and i feel sorry for some sick people who do n't receive proper treatment , but it 's less bad than most alternatives i know of . 
   a zero day gives you the possibility to infect . 
  once you start using it en masse , you 're going to get noticed immediately . 
  especially if you 're using it to commit vote fraud . 
  nope . 
  average attacks infecting thousands of targeted computers take a long time to be detected . 
  most zero-days get detected because the computers start getting used for something noisy ( e.g. 
  spamming the internet ) . 
  making a single server transaction ( a vote ) and masking the operation can be done very quietly . 
  it 's really difficult to detect sophisticated and targeted malware in the wild . 
   what do you mean by [ spoofing 2fa ] ? 
  you need to have control over second machine also . 
  you could even use a specialized device with screen that functions like a pendrive , which sings the vote . 
  in practice , most 2fa means sending an sms with a one-time-code to the authenticating party . 
  mobile network traffic can be intercepted , spoofed and manipulated at various points . 
  one could hack the ss7 network switching all telecommunication traffic ( easy for well resourced parties ) and reroute all infected vote authentications to your server , one could make replicas of the clients receiving the authentication messages or use rogue base-stations . 
   it can be made perfectly safe ( from a digital attack ) , even to the point that the required data and software resides on a physically write-once memory . 
  like , you get one from the government and enter your key , then use it for all of the future elections . 
  it displays your vote so an infected pc is not going to fool you . 
  you kind of start losing the benefits of convenience and economics when implementing this amount of crap in scale . 
  the very things making e-voting interesting in the first place . 
  this would basically mean distributing free ( allegedly infection free ) no-general-use voting computers for the masses . 
  yeah , i guess one could improve the integrity of the voting machine that way . 
  even then out from my hat , i can also think of a few possible attack vectors . 
  ensuring the security and integrity of the government signing servers , ensuring the delivery process works as intended ( if these devices are economically feasible to be provided in scale , they are economically feasible to counterfeit ) and dealing with reports of lost and damaged voting devices ( real and fraudulent ) . 
  open sourcing does not help much when verifying the integrity of the design . 
  we have a lot of open source security crap ( software and hardware ) which are proved to be broken all the time . 
  most often the bugs are there for years before they get noticed . 
  let 's remember that questioning the integrity of the vote is a very attractive goal alone . 
  that does n't even need success with vote manipulation or avoiding getting caught . 
  you can break fragile democratic processes by spreading doubt alone . 
   do you really think mass infecting voters ' pc to display vote for x as vote for y is going to work in practice ? 
  yes , you can infect , but people are going to know ` somebody ' faked thousands of votes for y and the vote result simply wo n't be implemented . 
  nope . 
  the typical zero-day takes almost a year to be detected . 
  ( https://users.ece.cmu.edu/~tdumitra/public_documents/bilge12_zero_day.pdf ) plenty of time for a vote fraud . 
  besides , questioning the legitimacy of the vote might be sufficient . 
  one can pull off a poc attack years after a vote to empower people who 'd already prefer to believe the government is malicious . 
   also , you can mitigate this by using two-factor auth , ie . 
  local computation of a vote is split between a pc and a smartphone . 
  as long as one is not infected it 's safe . 
  2 factor auths can be easily spoofed too . 
  cheaply . 
  this years ccc had some very good talks about ss7 security . 
   overall , vote fraud is much , much harder to execute compared to current system . 
  all you need today is a corrupt vote counting process , which is centralized . 
  it 's also much harder to detect fraud after the fact . 
  yes , pulling off a vote fraud is harder , but the problem with information security is that once an attack is feasible , those are easy to scale up to thousands of attacks . 
  paper vote fraud requires much more effort when scaled up . 
  the process is also more transparent . 
  anyone can understand how a paper vote is counted . 
  not so much with the evote . 
   you can verify the computation was done correctly . 
   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/verifiable_computing  hijacking a voter 's pc is the only way to fake cryptographic voting schemes . 
  do you have any idea of computer security ? 
  problem ai n't that one ca n't invent a trusted scheme to compute these things . 
  the problem is ensuring that the process of computation is actually the one described in the papers . 
  and as far as i 've dug in , the estonian evote ( nor any other evote system i 'm aware of ) is n't even using any particular verifiable computing schemes for vote counts . 
  according to halderman , their opsec seemed pretty crappy overall . 
   you can use your own computer with open source software . 
  you can even use an fpga with your own architecture . 
  does n't scale . 
  most voters still use crappy , easily crackable , non-patched malware infested old home pc 's and android phones . 
  like i said , the problem is practical . 
  not theoretical . 
  buy a few zero-days and an imsi catcher and you could hack tens or hundreds of thousands of votes fairly cheaply . 
   making that impossible is the whole point of cryptographically verifiable voting . 
  nope . 
  cryptography does not solve the trusted pc problem . 
  making sure that the computer decrypting the vote envelopes actually produces a valid input for the vote counter . 
  or that the vote counter itself computes correctly . 
  the mightiest cryptography breaks all the time . 
  it 's usually the systems ( implemented software & hardware ) that fail even though everything looks good on paper . 
  the problem is not in the theoretical side . 
  it 's with practical . 
  you ca n't verify the integrity of the home computer equipment doing the voting . 
  or the computer doing the vote counting . 
  this alone allows for a number of very practical attacks . 
  well , i know quite a lot about applied cryptography , networking and security - and i definitely think the e-vote is a horrible idea . 
  i know how it could be hacked , i know there are parties with the capabilities to do it and i know many of those have the resources to pull it off . 
  the worst part is , that you do n't even need to hack it to make pull off your political goal . 
  you have a vocal and big political minority who has a level of dislike for the government . 
  2 years after an election one can show them a proof of concept of exploiting the votes and they already want to believe the vote to be fraudulent . 
  without trustworthy electronic trail and incapability for oversight , one ca n't reasonably prove mere accusations to be false . 
  it 's fuel for trouble . 
  estonian e-vote is by far the best electronic ( governmental ) voting system i 've seen . 
  it really does a lot of good work avoiding some obvious engineering pitfalls i 've seen in other systems , but it still fails to answer to the fundamental security and integrity questions on why electronic voting is such a damning difficult problem to solve . 
  the nature of the threat is very demanding and persistent , and such an attack will undermine the legitimacy of estonian democracy itself . 
  not cool .

  absolutely . 
  and i ca n't blame them . 
  if mexico decided to enter into a ~ ~ military ~ ~ defense alliance with china , i 'm pretty sure us would n't say that it 's perfectly fine and in no way threatens them . 
   there are already plenty of nato countries bordering russia so it does n't increase their exposure . 
  am i reading you correct here . 
  are you saying that ukraine joining nato does n't matter , since there already is a bunch of nato countries bordering russia ? 
  it does n't matter that their old ally changes sides ? 
  or that the length of their border with an enemy increases ? 
   that must be why they have joint exercises on occasion and they agreed to reduce their atomic missiles and sell the scrap to each other . 
  small acts peacefulness does n't mean that they are n't enemies . 
  you can co-operate and have a common goal with an enemy . 
  salt i & ii did n't turn enemies into friends , or even make them not enemies . 
   ... because they just invaded part of ukraine already . 
  yeah . 
  we judge things based on history . 
  nato and ( especially ) usa both have a history of aggressive acts . 
  russia knows that nato has been the aggressor before , so who not in the future ? 
  yeah , and bringing missiles to cuba was a defensive act . 
  in my mind there 's no doubt about whether joining nato is an aggressive act or not . 
  going from neutral position to anti-russia position is pretty aggressive act . 
  nato and russia are sworn enemies , after all . 
  russia gathering troops alongside its baltic border is purely a defensive move too ( hey , they are just standing there , to prevent an attack !, 
  ) , but for some `` strange '' reason , we do n't see it like that . 
  we see it as it is . 
  an aggressive move . 
  and now after russia exploited the ukrainian turmoil , it does n't ? 
  if there 's anything to learn from ukraine , that 's to have a stable and neutral nation . 
  but that 's beside the point . 
  this is n't a plan any single ( small ) nation can achieve on their own . 
  but as a part of the eu , it 's very effective . 
  even without a defense pact , i highly doubt russia would be risking severe economical problems by attacking an eu nation . 
  ( they would need a * damn * good reason to !, 
  and i doubt if there 's such a reason . ), 
  there 's still call for conventional armies , but i do n't think building up massive armies is the solution . 
  having a `` i need you - you need me '' situation is what i believe is the answer . 
  we are actually planning on fighting for two weeks before surrendering if russia attacks . 
  and last i heard , even that was said to be too long , that the actual possible length was closer to six days . 
  but that would mean six damn expensive days for russia to achieve ... what ? 
  what would possible be worth it for them ? 
  and that 's our strategy in a nutshell . 
  make it too costly for them . 
  i would choose nordic co-operation over us dictating things any day . 
  nordic defense pact is the most desirable of the solutions that there are for finland . 
  but it 's not likely to happen . 
  swedish-finnish defense union is possible , but it would need a strong guarantee of mutual assistance , like a political union . 
  and that 's way harder to achieve than a pure defensive union . 
  iirc , some russian officials have even said that they wo n't `` tolerate '' finland joining nato . 
  though i do n't like the tone of that , by taking a quick look at a map , anyone can see why they really do n't wish to see a nato finland . 
  bringing yanks to finland would be a pretty aggressive act , even though it 's our right as a sovereign nation to do so , if we wish to . 
  i do n't think that re-armament is the answer . 
  i think europe is better of tying russia even stronger to rest if europe by economic means is the way to go . 
  i think some famous philosopher/theorist had something to say about this ... 
  and that 's basically the reason why finland does n't want to join . 
  e : the us centrism that is . 
  unless we go by body count . 
  easier to just repost one of the several that have already been done . 
  it 's a hawk , okay . 
  the default character in an rpg . 
  can confirm . 
  i just hope there will be a referendum , sooner than later . 
  then it will be clear where the uk stands and we can get back to work , so to speak . 
  after hearing so much moaning about eu , i think the uk might just go with us rather than us . 
  and that might actually be a good thing . 
  j\u00f6rn donner is absolutely a prick . 
  i 've personally met him . 
  it was a brief encounter but he sure used that time well to make it clear . 
  i just think it 's a hilarious thing to say about any country . 
  though the historical animosity between finland and russia makes it funnier to me . 
  i was n't saying things would n't be worse under un , just that they are n't really optimal as of now . 
  agreed . 
  seems like a reasonable change . 
   if the us keeps control , the internet stays free ehhhh ... 
  there are fat finn jokes ? 
  we put the currency after the number . 
  as is logical . 
  that would be pretty rad . 
  everyone knows that !, 
  he means the roma , not romanians . 
  twist : everyone shows up in blackface in an misguided attempt to show support . 
  hey , it 's lahti after all . 
  all debts are forgiven :'), 
  super awesome . 
  also , by forming a `` block '' , we would have more power in the eu . 
  reminds me of great quote ( allegedly by jari tervo , i was unable to confirm it ) : `` the only fault of russia concerning us finns is its location . 
  why could n't it border sweden , for example ? 
  then again , that 's what they 've tried to achieve a few times . '', 
  ( bad translation . ), 
  unrelated hilarious finnish quote about russia : `` in russia , everything is shit except piss . '', 
  - j\u00f6rn donner, 
  did n't helsingin sanomat already put up an article on the effects this will have on our image abroad ? 
  it 's hilarious how much we care .

   do you really think that we have one channel in russia ? 
  just as you do we have opportunity to watch anything you 've mentioned both through internet and tv network it does n't really matter if russians have an access to those channels as only about 5 % of russians speak english . 
  russian state controls the tv-channels and broadcasting in russia , and they 're broadcasting their propaganda in russian . 
   fox probably has the most blatant , ridiculous propaganda but it 's not us state propaganda . 
  while fox is biased , it 's leaning towards the gop . 
  it 's a conservative channel with heavy conservative bias . 
  hence it broadcasts claims that are very critical of the democrats and the current democrat administration - sometimes even to the point of being ridiculous . 
  broadcasting stories in russian television how putin is probably not a russian citizen , or may be a muslim , or how everything he does is morally wrong and damaging to russia will get you out of air , and probably to jail . 
   but the others have a fair amount of bias as well . 
  every news channel and news outlet has their own biases . 
  it is journalism 101 . 
  but as you have heterogenous media field you do have choises between those , and you get to hear those different biases . 
  not so when you have state controlled media , then you have only the state bias and state propaganda . 
  and i agree with your general sentiment . 
  my personal totally subjective feel is that the quality of journalism in the us has been declining since the 90s . 
  perhaps not by much , but noticeably . 
  there seems to be less investigative journalism with big stories and big revelations than there used to be . 
  i do n't know why that is ( less resources perhaps ? 
  ) , and it is only my subjective perception . 
  it 's just like fox news then ? 
  no , not really . 
  but if it claimed that vladimir putin is actually a muslim and not even russian citizen , and everything he does is wrong and damaging to the country , then it would be a bit like fox news . 
   it is hard to expect major american channels to go full-throttle critical about the us , would n't you say ? 
  have you ever watched for example fox news ? 
  it 's full of stories about what 's wrong in america and how it 's us goverment 's fault - especially obama 's . 
   taking hostages and then denying it would make these guys the silliest terrorists in history . 
  it would make perfect sense in this case . 
  firstly , they certainly would not want to appear publicly as hostage taking terrorists - i mean even ~ ~ putin ~ ~ russia today would have hard time to spin that story . 
  secondly , human shields . 
  the purpose of hostages would be just to keep the goverment from storming the building , unlike in many other hostage situations where maximum publicity is wanted for threats unless demands are met . 
  thirdly , anschluss provocation . 
  having hostages would be handy for creating civilian victims for putin 's pretext for military invasion . 
  shoot them or explode them and suddenly the eastern ukraine is in urgent need of putin 's ` protection ' . 
  and he has troops ready . 
  actually , their citizenships and identities were unknown as they had no papers on them when arrested . 
  they merely claimed to be ukrainians . 
  some of them are apparently exports from russia : [ kerry says russia creating pretext for ukraine invasion ] ( http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2014/04/08/ukraine-kharkiv-protesters/7459031/ )  pro-russia demonstrators in ukraine 's east are getting support from russians inside ukraine , though the `` volunteers '' as they are called may not all be acting on orders from moscow , say experts and pro-russia groups . 
   `` they do n't make up a big share of the demonstrators , but there are up to a thousand russian volunteers in ukraine , '' said analyst sergei markov , a backer of the russian government who has advised the kremlin on ukraine . 
  `` they make up maybe 1 % demonstrators . '', 
   asked if those volunteers would be willing to take up arms if a conflict broke out , markov said `` of course . '', 
   markov said the actions of the russian volunteers is `` largely '' spontaneous . 
  if violent clashes erupt , `` the number of volunteers will grow significantly . '', 
   `` sometimes they coordinate their activities with ( russian authorities ) , sometimes they do n't , '' he said . 
  * `` of course . 
  an english source : [ protesters storm kharkiv theater thinking it was city hall ] ( http://www.themoscowtimes.com/news/article/protesters-storm-kharkiv-theater-thinking-it-was-city-hall/497709.html ), 
   because the same reason why maidan protesters got violent and took over buildings and all , although they were allowed to voice their opinion . 
  the ball of violence got rolling 30 november at 4:00 am when the berkut special police forces violently attacked completely peaceful protesters voicing their opinion at maidan nezalezhnosti . 
  the berkut used batons , stun grenades and tear gas . 
  79 people were injured including journalists with cameras . 
  later the police claimed they did it because of the need to put up christmas decorations on the maidan . 
  that violent raid led to huge mass protests . 
  * my\u00f6t\u00e4h\u00e4pe\u00e4 * - dat sense of shame you feel on someone else 's behalf when ( s ) he really screwed up * pilkunnussija * - lit . 
  comma fucker , the universal pedant always correcting meaningless trivialities also , * perkele * !, 
  also moldovan wines . 
  remember when yanukovich regime was shooting and killing protesters including russian speakers and ethnic russians and russia told him not to use force ? 
  yeah , me neither . 
   people who illegally seized government buildings in kiev were freedom fighters . 
  actually ukrainian goverment called them terrorists . 
   people who illegally seized government buildings in kharkhiv are terrorists . 
  apparently also in this case the ukrainian government has called them terrorists . 
  so , we have two instances of people illegally seizing gov buidings and government calling them terrorists . 
  apparently illegally seizing government buildings in ukraine may lead to goverment calling you a terrorist , albeit a sample of two is a bit small for firm conclusions . 
  * keep your frienemies close but your frienemies closer . 
  * - sun tzu, 
  and based on the points on the map it is not immediately clear if people were ignorant of the geographical location of ukraine or merely confused of its size . 
   gazprom chief executive alexei miller raised questions about the legality of reversing gas flows to ukraine in an interview aired on russian state television on saturday . 
  and the eu has raised questions about the legality of contractual clausules restricting gas flows , and an investigation and legal case has been in the works since 2012 : [ antitrust : commission opens proceedings against gazprom ] ( http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_ip-12-937_en.htm?locale=fr ) i do n't know what the current status of the case is or how the legal action is proceeding . 
  ukraine . 
  it 's ... canberra !, 
   but the opposition made all indications that it would not honour deals that yanukovich made with putin , the new government was not about to nullify the kharkov pact , in fact they specifically said they will uphold it . 
  it was russia that nullified it . 
   whilst simultaneously inviting nato in , the new government did n't do that either . 
  both your claims are unsubstantiated , and invented as a justification for putin 's possible * feelings * . 
  putin has failed at his foreign policy , hence the unnecessary use of military power . 
  the naval base would have been easily secured by soft power alone . 
  but for putin it 's all a zero sum game , and as he opted out from the soft power he has lost the game on the long run . 
  ukraine will distance itself from russia even more , and it 's putin 's fault . 
  and him claiming crimea annexed is a pyrrhic victory . 
  in long run it does n't even matter if he ` annexes ' more , because it will all be temporary . 
  putin 's regime wo n't last forever , and when it falls it wo n't have a soft landing . 
  they are ? 
  til . 
  in finnish they 're all it ( * se * ) . 
  if you 're interested , here 's a pretty good assessment of the relevant strategy : [ ukraine : invasion is russia 's fallback option ] ( http://server1.nationalinterest.org/commentary/ukraine-invasion-russias-fallback-option-10197 ) my thinking is much along similar lines . 
  currently it is important to keep russia away from the fallback option . 
  keeping sanctions in place and extending them only stepwise as necessary is the most effective way to do it . 
  currently - but one has to remember that the situation is tense and volatile : putin 's foreign policy is a failure , his great project is crumbling and there is a possibility of him resorting to the fallback option . 
  additionally , as crazy as it may sound now , i do n't think russia 's claimed annexation of crimea is more than of temporary nature . 
  putin 's regime is not going to last forever and it wo n't fall down softly when its time has run out ( a decade ? 
   russia is very good at this sort of thing and based on the level of fail on their site finnbay is n't . 
   do you think that the general lack of gender in the finnish language has influenced society at all ? 
  personally i do n't think so , but then again it 's difficult for me to say as i 'm immersed in it , and the question needs more of a scholarly opinion . 
  i have sometimes seen * painotus * but that 's not exactly the same either . 
  no offence taken at all , and i apologize my tone . 
  sometimes it 's just frustrating how easily the kremlin narrative of history is accepted and repeated even by the media which should have a crical eye . 
   do you have words that you can put a gender on , like actor and actress ? 
  yes , you can add it in a kind of awkward and archaic way with * - tar / - t\u00e4r * : * n\u00e4yttelij\u00e4 * , actor * n\u00e4yttelij\u00e4t\u00e4r * , actress but using * n\u00e4yttelij\u00e4t\u00e4r * is rare , and * n\u00e4yttelij\u00e4 * goes just as well for both genders . 
  if gender needs to be emphasized then it 's more common to express it more explicitly by adding if it 's a man ( * mies - * ) or woman ( * nais - * ) we 're talking about : * miesn\u00e4yttelij\u00e4 * , male actor * naisn\u00e4yttelij\u00e4 * , female actor but most often it 's just simply * n\u00e4yttelij\u00e4 * for both . 
   or is everything gender neutral ? 
  basically yes , and explicitly stating gender has to be done by additional constructs .

  have n't really followed the former at all . 
  very true . 
  i see i should have made the distinction between the english and arabic . 
  ok then . 
  edit : is it because they show those beheading videos , or because their name is awfully `` araby '' ? 
  ok then . 
   as we all know , all jazeera is an islamist news agency , hence the documentary is totally biased . 
  this is n't true at all . 
  although like every news source [ they have been accused of bias ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/al_jazeera_controversies_and_criticism ) , and like all news sources they ca n't be * absolutely * unbiased , they are most certainly not an '' [ islamist ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/islamism ) '' news agency . 
  same as the christian science monitor is n't a religious publication in its reporting . 
  thanks for the link , i 'll watch this later . 
  hey , it 's all right . 
  cheers . 
  that was interesting . 
  they really are great stories !, 
  i still remember reading the [ br\u00f6derna lejonhj\u00e4rta ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_brothers_lionheart ) at about 7-8 years of age . 
  i think now that i was way too young for that book . 
  a good article , thanks . 
  i found this intriguing :  after the war , sweden tried to form a nordic defense alliance . 
  this was rejected by denmark and norway who in 1949 instead chose to join nato . 
  sweden resorted to an official policy of non-alignment in peacetime and aimed at neutrality during times of war . 
  as strange as this might look today , there was a good reason for this . 
  had sweden joined nato at the time , this would probably have caused the soviet union to tighten its grip on the already subdued finland , possibly even annexing it . 
  this would have benefited neither sweden , who would then once again have its own land border with the soviet union , nor nato , which would be faced with an even longer border with the soviet union . 
  ah , you know [ emil ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/emil_i_l%c3%b6nneberga ) , too !,

  i 'd never heard about this cereal before . 
   triticale , which is a hybrid of wheat ( triticum ) and rye ( secale ) , is mainly used for animal feed . 
  moar :  depending on the cultivar , triticale can more or less resemble either of its parents . 
  it is grown mostly for forage or fodder , although some triticale-based foods can be purchased at health food stores or are to be found in some breakfast cereals . 
  thanks for the explanation . 
  their operation tactics/rules seem to vary a lot from country to country . 
   an entire generation is being drilled to accept that operating above society as a belligerent economic agent is not just normal , but virtuous . 
  well put , and i agree !, 
  i 'm in !, 
  ( can i bring my knife ? ), 
  ( edit : this is because i like to whittle wooden figurines in a shed ), 
  yeah , its surprising . 
  more about chief mousers : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/chief_mouser_to_the_cabinet_office  the cat with the longest known tenure at downing street is wilberforce , who served for eighteen years under edward heath , harold wilson , jim callaghan , and margaret thatcher . 
  it looks like they had that phone call system according to this from [ the live thread ] ( https://www.reddit.com/live/x8sgngqk712c ) :  some tech updates about the railway and the trains involved : according to wikipedia ( https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/ferrovia_bari-barletta ) this railway has not automatic safety infrastructure , it 's old and it 's managed by humans with the so called `` blocco telefonico '' method : each station guard ( in this case the one in andria e the one in corato ) has to phone the next station before sending a train and ask if there 's another train already on the line . 
  there 's no automatic block or something on the line . 
  good points . 
  my background is obviously quite different coming from a country with a 1-2 % muslim population . 
  and my comment was really a generalisation on xenophobia and how i believe that living and meeting with different kinds of people tends to alleviate fear and/or hatred . 
  just a personal observation . 
  i certainly do n't want to underplay the dangers of religious fanatisism . 
  yeah , that came out a little sarcastic/giddy , i guess . 
  it 's a good thing they were caught . 
  this is certainly more serious than just forging more expensive evo from regular olive oil .

  well said , i agree, 
  i 'm actually a bit worried about the next episode of mock the week . 
  yay , finland is still half communist . 
  it 's true . 
  it 's been said that the [ heavy reparations we had to pay to ussr ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/finnish_war_reparations_to_the_soviet_union ) , mostly in forms of ships and machinery , actually helped to build up our heavy industry after the war . 
  is n't it . 
  and i was only half joking . 
  nothing like media attention from abroad to cause stir here . 
  the pins are actually compressed from large trees .

  agreed , but then again the nostalgia market of the west is not their main market . 
  these phones are targeted for india , china , africa . 
  having a certain cheap look is a statement of its own and part of the branding . 
  ostrobothnian dialects have similarities with norrl\u00e4ndska dialects . 
  are n't swedes exposed to finlandsvenska through moomin ? 
  they were cornered by stone throwers, 
  nice church boat there, 
  it 's very simple cause and effect : russia increases military presence , finland does the same . 
  as i said , you can call it whatever you want in your world . 
  [ army doctrine 2015 -- basics ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2crax8kibis ), 
  he just said he was the only white person there . 
  how are the swedes supposed to know what happens outside their town center ? 
  you may call it whatever you like , but with a majority finnish ( ~ 68 % ) and a minority swedish ( ~ 28 % ) it is a bi-lingual municipality where the finnish name comes first . 
  finland 's economy would tank , but it only represents about 2.3 % of the eurozone gdp so a short term hit to the emu countries economies . 
  a much smaller hit than them joining a war however . 
  not to mention the social and political unwillingness to enter a war . 
  most of europe would n't even fight for their own countries . 
  but if you 're an expert on the matter , please enlighten . 
   finland is a eu member . 
  ukraine is not . 
  currently the nbg is the only relevant part of the eu for defence . 
  they are tiny and lightly armed . 
   finland is a eurozone member . 
  ukraine is not . 
  has no impact on defence . 
   does that mean war is impossible ? 
  but if the eu did n't back finland in a war against russia , it would be the end of the union and of the eurozone . 
  the eurozone did n't fall with the piigs countries , doubt tiny finland would have any impact . 
  as for the eu , they are about to lose the uk yet the union is still going strong . 
  there are no morals in world politics , it 's only about monetary - or power gains , and finland is worth neither to the west . 
   the last time finland was at war was five billion years ago and europe had other , much bigger problems . 
  the people who fought it are still alive . 
  you 're right , europe had a lot of problems back then ; a polarized political climate , high unemployment , lack of pan-european unity , disrupted economies and unstable africa . 
  good thing none of those are an issue now . 
  you mean like what is currently happening in ukraine ? 
  / edit : and also happened last time finland was at war .

  you 're linking a wine magazine as source . 
  https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/alcohol/alcohol-fact-sheet  ** what is the evidence that alcohol drinking is a cause of cancer ? 
  **  based on extensive reviews of research studies , there is a strong scientific consensus of an association between alcohol drinking and several types of cancer ( 1 , 2 ) . 
  in its report on carcinogens , the national toxicology program of the us department of health and human services lists consumption of alcoholic beverages as a known human carcinogen . 
  the research evidence indicates that the more alcohol a person drinks -- particularly the more alcohol a person drinks regularly over time -- the higher his or her risk of developing an alcohol-associated cancer . 
  based on data from 2009 , an estimated 3.5 percent of all cancer deaths in the united states ( about 19,500 deaths ) were alcohol related ( 3 ) . 
   * head and neck cancer  * esophageal cancer  * liver cancer  * breast cancer  * colorectal cancer you 're right on the sugar though , i completely misremembered that . 
  * note that me and the two persons i responded to were talking specifically about finland . 
   is is known to have positive effects to drink roughly 1 glass of wine ( or equivavent amount of other alcohol ) every day . 
  that 's a myth . 
  even small amounts of alcohol negatively affect your health . 
  a slight improvement in heart disease risk is offset by the high sugar content and carcinogens . 
  both drinking and smoking are losing ground among the millennials . 
  it 's middle aged women who are the top consumers iirc . 
  i remember reading an interview that he ( the singer ) had to throw away the suits they had used and make new ones . 
  they 're mostly made of reindeer hides and latex iirc . 
  an overwhelming majority of kebab in finland is made by a single company , though . 
  not by immigrants .

  what was the casualty rate in russian death camps ? 
  this is a good summary of the war . 
  however , despite territorial losses , finland did stop the annexation attempt and remained independent in the end . 
  the ussr got 10 % of their goal and paid a high price for it , yet they largely dictated the peace terms . 
  one certainly can not say that finland won the war . 
  i do n't know why people are downvoting you for a correct comment .

  we can settle for two of your finest jokes about swedes . 
  honestly how much would change ? 
  but also how much more info there is for us to consume . 
  30 years ago politics demanded much larger space in your daily news stream . 
  today it has to compete with so much more so it kinda dilutes in the cacophonie . 
  it was a dumb thing to say but i honestly just think he was trying to pay her a compliment . 
  as much as i wish he would be that level of creep . 
  not likely . 
  stupid . 
  / s really hard to say really , we are so familiar with it any strange characteristics dial down . 
  one word that keeps coming is feminine . 
  comparing finnish and swedish , finnish is to me more raunchy and swedish is more poetic and song-like . 
  we usually sit on a large table and eat , silently . 
  and one of the uncles drinks a bit too much and starts yelling and cussing and opening up how he has been wronged either by relatives or his boss or the system or whatever . 
  and eventually grandmother kicks him out of the house . 
  if there is n't fighting it just is n't a true family gathering . 
  do dutch family members ever not speak when meeting ? 
  obviously we talk , we talk just as much if not more than many other nationalities . 
  we are reserved , and do not usually like to open up instantly but after we feel the setting calls for it we will not stop talking . 
  makes kinda sense do n't it ? 
  having to keep thoughts to yourself which then are released in a frenzy of babbling . 
  i do n't carry cash . 
  in fact my wallet does n't even have a coin compartment and i have to fold the bills i seldomly get to make them fit . 
  plastic money rules in finland . 
  and , you know , most of the people having ancestors who moved there from europe just a few hundred years ago . 
  most if not all nationalities in europe have more history than them . 
  stands to reason us is more diverse . 
  the less there are vowels the more likely the language is polish . 
  yes . 
  critical attitude is missing completely . 
  there 's a finnish proverb `` fire is a good farmhand but a terrible master '' . 
  i 'd like to apply that here as well : digitalisation can be good if it 's seen as a tool , means to improve . 
  so is the goal to become more digitalised or to improve education ? 
  finns love rules . 
  have a politician make a education policies and guidelines and teachers will follow them to a point . 
  most decisions they do have a good idea behind them but some things like the digitalisation are blinding because they are seen as absolute improvements and any assessment about if they actually work are thus pointless . 
  which is obviously wrong way to do things . 
  yeah . 
  schools and teachers look at their average scores and dictate from there if they are succesful . 
  there 's gaps where individual students fall thru and that 's a major problem . 
  and it 's a problem we should focus more at . 
  i think right now the finnish education ministry is bathing on the limelight given by all the foreigners when they look and congratulate the things we do , but they fail to understand that it 's far from perfect and they should try to improve it more . 
  digitalization is one they are pushing hard but it looks like they do it for the digitalizations sake , not for the students . 
  some politician has figured that anything digi - is awesome , there 's a huge risk of doing disservice to our education . 
  it 's smart , but i dislike how we look at the averages . 
  people get hidden behind thr averages , there should be more personal notice . 
  so even if it ' good , it could be much better . 
  oh you ... we like you too .

  i live near oulu , but i used to live in helsinki and have been in the vierum\u00e4ki sports academy a few brief instances as a kid . 
  i do n't know much of the neighborhood but i 'm sure it 's good . 
  heinola is the city and that 's one of the prettiest summer towns in finland . 
  can i ask if you 'll be going to the sports academy or ? 
  well , we start swedish lessons on the 7th grade and study for three years . 
  that continues in highschool ( gymnasiet ) if you go there but you can get thru these without really learning anything . 
  i 'd say most do not speak swedish , i personally can understand 70 % but ca n't contribute anything to the conversation . 
  yes i have , to mariehamn . 
  it 's an amazing place but i should next time travel deeper into the island and see more of the countryside .

  haha !, 
  a finn told a swede : * `` look at these . 
  these are smart pills . 
  eat some and i guarantee you 'll get smarter . 
  '' * the swede figured this would be a great deal so he took a few but when it did n't seem to have any effect asked for some more . 
  * `` there you go buddy , have a handful ! '', 
  * the swede looks at the pills and yells : * `` hey these are n't smart pills , these are rabbit droppings !, 
  '' * * `` yes they are sven , you 're already getting smarter . 
  a finn and a swede were arguing . 
  * `` i 'm willing to bet my head i 'm right '' * , said the swede . 
  * `` and i will bet my pockets '' * , answered the finn . 
  * `` but ... your pockets are empty ? 
  '' * * `` exactly , so both bets are equal '' * edit : honestly , you guys are best neighbors we could have . 
  so maybe make some sort of catcher in front of the car and harvest all the birds !, 
  classic neighbourly love . 
  i can relate hard . 
  ah , have n't had grouse in a while . 
  looks and sounds absolutely delicious !,

   really ? 
  because i 'm looking at my network traffic and the source code on this page and it looks like that image came from a wikimedia server , not your pc/smartphone/whatever . 
  yet still you could see the image by just clicking the link . 
  you got the information , even though physically it is located in some remote server from both of us . 
  that 's the point of the internet : the movement of information is n't bound to its physical location . 
  * how can you have missed this ? 
  *  are you absolutely sure you did n't just tell me where i could find a picture of asses on that server ? 
  yea . 
  when you look at that picture , you do n't see information where you could find a picture of asses . 
  you see a picture of asses . 
   you include the link , i click it , then my computer loads the image from the server that link points to . 
  you did n't send me any information beyond where to find the image . 
  so , when the image loaded , instead of asses you just got instructions where to find pictures of asses ? 
  when i am giving you a book , and you take it from me , i am not giving you information where to find the information in the book . 
  i am giving you the book which you can then open and get the information . 
  * clicking a link is equivalent of you taking a book i am offering you . 
   sure they are n't . 
  who else is on google searching for bomb-making plans ? 
  google is n't specifically designed to give specifically bomb instructions . 
  it automatically just reacts to whatever keywords given . 
  even though i can google `` kitten pudding rice vinegar superstar fireworks '' and get some results , it does not mean google is specifically designed to provide information about `` kitten pudding rice vinegar superstar fireworks '' . 
   he never provided them with instructions , he told them where they could find publicly-accessible instructions . 
  there 's a pretty big difference there . 
  you seem to live in the 20th century , like those grandpas who believe the internet is somehow less real and providing instructions on the internet is somehow less real than providing them in real life . 
  and you do n't seem to understand that providing links is providing information . 
  when i am linking you [ this picture ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/42/somali_wild_ass_pair.jpg ) , i am not telling you where to find a picture of asses . 
  i am linking you directly to a specific information selected by me for you to see . 
  * on the world wide web , links are one of the main formats to send information to others . 
  * when wikipedia has links to other articles , like an article about [ asses ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/donkey ) , clicking the links do not provide you information where you can find information about asses . 
  clicking that link directly provides you with information about asses . 
  yea , i know . 
  makes it a strange situation when median income people pay around 30 % taxes of their earned income , and the richest who get their income from dividends are taxed the same rate . 
   did you not read the quote you just posted ? 
  `` these guys are pussy keyboard warriors '' clearly demonstrates that he does n't believe they 're actually terrorists . 
  not when you consider this : '' * goldberg also claimed that the meant for the person he was communicating with to either kill himself creating the bomb or , that goldberg intended to warn police in time so that he would receive ` credit for stopping the attack ' * '' . 
  that demonstrates that at least in some point he really did hold it possible someone would commit a terrorist act with his instructions . 
   you 've already said that their motives are n't relevant , the important fact is that google is linking people to bomb-making plans and is therefore a criminal organization by your logic . 
  i said the * hidden * motive of the suspect is not relevant . 
  what is relevant how he perceived the motives of others and how he himself acted in relation to the motives of others . 
  google is n't specifically targeting those links to people they suspect want to commit terrorist acts . 
  google is an automated system which does not have the capability to suspect the motives of others . 
  if google as an organization made a human decision to proactively send to isis all the links considering bomb instructions , guerilla warfare , train and plane timetables and how to utilize weak points of these with a suggestion drafted by google where and when to utilize these things , then google would be actively helping to plan a terrorist act . 
   ok , so since he did n't do 2 and clearly did n't think the person would actually go through with 3 all that 's left is `` suggesting targets for terrorist acts '' . 
  he provided instructions how to make a bomb , so yea , he did give instructions . 
  and as said above , at least in some point he thought the person could commit the act : '' * goldberg also claimed that the meant for the person he was communicating with to either kill himself creating the bomb or , that goldberg intended to warn police in time so that he would receive ` credit for stopping the attack ' * '' . 
   the unabomber also actually bombed people . 
  so what ? 
  he was n't a professional so clearly he 's innocent by your logic . 
   did he think that ? 
  i have a hard time imagining the state being able to prove it beyond a reasonable doubt . 
  according to [ this article ] ( http://www.smh.com.au/national/australian-is-jihadist-is-actually-an-jewish-american-troll-20150911-gjk852.html ) '' * goldberg also claimed that he meant for the person he was communicating with to either kill himself creating the bomb or , that goldberg intended to warn police in time so that he would receive ` credit for stopping the attack ' . 
  * '' also in the same article it says '' * mr goldberg had said he did not expect any jihadist to actually carry out an attack because : ` these guys are pussy keyboard warriors ' . 
  * so at the same time he expected someone to build the bomb , and also that he did believe he was communicating with jihadists . 
  his rational that jihadists are `` pussy keyboard warriors '' is n't really a strong defense to overrule the incriminating parts he said . 
  but that will be for the courts to decide . 
   if linking is the same thing as serving , then google even more culpable than he is as i can guarantee you that google serves up those same links to anyone who asks for them . 
  but google does not know of their intentions , deliver the information based on those intentions , nor does google additionally suggest to commit a terrorist act . 
   likewise , if suggesting a target is a crime then half of the right-wing blogosphere is 8 years overdue for a visit with the secret service regarding their indirect threats against the president . 
  it 's the combination of things : suggesting targets for terrorist acts ( 1 ) instructions to do it ( 2 ) specifically to a person who you think has the will to commit such an act ( 3 ) . 
  the crime would be the sum of the parts , not individual parts . 
   so do professional pilots . 
  is there any evidence that this guy ever attempted to make a bomb before ? 
  if not , then why is his ` expertise ' a threat to the free world ? 
  his level of expertise does not matter . 
  unabomber made home made rudimentary bombs . 
  it does not matter what his hidden motives were . 
  he participated in planning with people he thought were real people wanting to commit a terrorist act , his * action * of supplying bomb instructions and suggestions for targets is the crime , not the * motivation * why he did it . 
  and it does not matter that he was n't a professional bomb maker . 
  the guys who flew to wtc towers were n't professional pilots either . 
  they practiced with microsoft flight simulator . 
  well , compared to the richest , yea . 
  one word : gun . 
  just because it is legal to have guns , it is not legal to plan and help others realize a terrorist act utilizing guns . 
  so , you are saying knowingly making and helping plans for a terrorist act should not a crime ? 
  no , because google is n't actively and in a planned manner trying to deliver bomb instructions specifically to terrorists . 
  if google were to act out a plan to deliver usb stick to isis with all kind of bomb making and guerrilla warfare material to isis , then the actions of google would be radical . 
  [ here 's a graph ] ( http://blogi.kansanelakelaitos.fi/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/verokuvio_blogi.jpg ) how much finnish people pay taxes from their total income . 
  you can see that the richer you get , the easier it is for you to pay smaller proportion from your taxes than middle income people . 
  pay cuts in finland are n't really suggested as austerity to save money , but as an internal deflation to lower the cost of workers so economy would grow . 
  so pay cuts alone are not austerity , although they can be a part of austerity . 
  also in spain they have invested in their infrastructure for a long time before the economic crisis , making them one of the world leaders in exporting infrastructure business . 
  akava [ itself says ] ( http://www.akava.fi/akavalainen/ajassa/viikon_luku/keskituloiset_maksavat_yli_puolet_valtion_ansiotuloverosta ) in their original publication of that sheet that it 's about earned income tax to the state , in the very headline of the publication , in the main text of the publication and that 's also the name of the original file . 
  likewise as the title in the sheet itself says `` earned income tax for the state '' and the the bars on the right simply say `` tax to the state '' . 
  ass all the references to the taxes in the main content speak just specifically about ( earned income ) tax to the government , and there is no reference asterisk for the footnote , i doubt the asterisk means they included municipal taxes in those two . 
  rather it seems the image is just a part of some larger power point presentation and the asterisk refers to something not in that sheet . 
  hence the lack of reference asterisk . 
   but this is very concerning indeed because it raises questions whether it is sustainable only as long as high earners bring in dough , i.e. 
  private sector does good . 
  well , i have always had the impression that the point of nordic model is to have mixed economy so that the free market & private sector is efficient in creating additional value which is then utilized to benefit the whole society . 
  but of course the public sector in finland also helps to create additional value , but the salaries of public sector generally just are n't as high as in the private sector . 
  soo , what you are saying that the government assumption that the pay cuts would boost the finnish economy is pretty optimistic , unreasonably so ? 
  i think it applies to several insignificant countries like canada ^ sorry, 
  i would have preferred that finland invests in electricity & energy technology and renewables ( which are booming in the world ) first by increasing internal demand for those via government targets . 
  then we can get an internal market and create businesses which then already have running operations due to internal markets and they could then start exporting their products to eu and the whole world which has a increasing demand for such industries . 
  but no , they had to force the state company fortum to participate along with municipals and rosatom fennovoima so we can make sure we have less business opportunities in the internal market for alternative private energy technologies to grow . 
   as per the status quo we are taking more loans even without any stimulations . 
  which is silly , as taking continuously loans to fill leaking holes of the boat with pieces of paper which dissolve away , instead of taking loans to buy glue to fill the holes . 
   and even worse , if the kick start does n't work ( due to another major recession or continued deflation in the euro zone etc. ), 
  we are left with problems far more severe than today , just to delay the inevitable . 
  well , we can also speculate that the austerity does n't work and we are left with more problems far more severe than today .

  october [ gfk ukraine poll ] ( http://www.gfk.ua/public_relations/press/press_articles/011218/index.ua.html ) shows three times the support for association agreement with the eu compared to russia 's customs union : [ graph ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ldjvevm ) [ september poll ] ( http://www.kiis.com.ua/?lang=rus&amp;cat=reports&amp;id=196&amp;page=1 ) by the kyiv international institute of sociology showed 41 % favoring the eu and 35 % russia 's customs union .

   i decided to continue with ( un ) popular series that i hope that in your mission , whatever that may be , you also bear in mind that the purpose of the subreddit really is n't to serve as anyone 's personal soapbox for narrow political activism .

  interviews with survivors : [ in ukraine , holodomor 's terrors remain fresh in the minds of survivors ] ( http://www.rferl.org/content/ukraine-holodomor-famine-survivors/25178009.html )  the holodomor , as the famine is now known , was never officially acknowledged by soviet authorities , who said crop failure was to blame for any random accounts of starvation . 
   but as ukraine has been preparing to mark the 80th anniversary of the holodomor on november 23 , the few remaining survivors remember the famine as deliberate , sweeping , and filled with terror . 
  the eu already is one of ukraine 's biggest trading partners . 
  the association agreement includes better access to the eu common market and even more trade . 
  in 2012 the value of ukraine 's trade with the eu was $ 37.7 bn which is almost as big as trade with the whole cis blok at $ 38.2 bn , [ graph ] ( http://i.imgur.com/3pgftlx ) ukraine 's exports to the eu are bigger than it 's exports to russia . 
  in 2012 ukraine 's exports to the eu were [ about $ 14.6 bn ] ( http://trade.ec.europa.eu/doclib/docs/2006/september/tradoc_113459.pdf ) and to the russia [ about $ 13.3 bn ( $ 18 bn ) ] ( http://rt.com/business/russia-ukraine-customs-eu-319/ ) . 
  [ trade in 2011 ] ( http://eeas.europa.eu/delegations/ukraine/eu_ukraine/trade_relation/bilateral_trade/index_en.htm ) by the current agreements ( e.g. 
  gsp , mfn ) :  the eu is ukraine 's second largest trading partner : in 2011 , 26,6 % of all ukrainian exports of goods went to the eu and 31,2 % of imports of goods came from the eu . 
  eu-ukraine trade in goods reached $ 36.6 billion in 2011 ( an increase of 1,1 % compared to 2010 ) . 
    the main goods ukraine exports to the eu are ferrous metals , iron ore , electric machinery and cereals . 
  the main goods the eu exports to ukraine are machinery , transport equipment , chemicals , textile and clothing , and agricultural products . 
    ukrainian exports to the eu are to a large extent already liberalised thanks to the generalised system of preferences ( gsp ) , which the eu granted to ukraine in 1993 . 
  in 2011 , total preferential exports to the eu under gsp amounted to 16.8 % of overall ukrainian exports by volume . 
  preferential imports include machinery and mechanical appliances , plants , oils , base metals , chemicals and textiles . 
  furthermore , there are sectors where the most favoured nation ( mfn ) duty applied by the eu is already zero ( around 42 % of all agricultural products can be sold duty-free by the ukrainian exporters on the eu market ) . 
    existing quantitative import restrictions on steel and textiles were cancelled on may 16 2008 when ukraine acceded to the wto . 
  since then ukraine enjoys unrestricted exports of steel and textiles to the eu . 
  the association agreement includes the deep and comprehensive free trade area ( dcfta ) chapter which would give ukraine even better access to the eu common market . 
  dcfta would give an access to the eu 's 500 million consumers and market with a combined economy of 12.9 trillion euros , while russia 's customs union has just 170 million consumers and a combined economy of 1.4 trillion euros . 
  it also covers other things and a signing country must adopt about 350 eu laws within ten years regarding trade , consumer protection , environmental regulation etc. 
  [ explainer : what exactly is an eu association agreement ? 
  ] ( http://www.rferl.org/content/eu-association-agreement-explained/25174247.html ) i really can not see how the eu could or would sweeten the deal from that . 
  offer bribes ? 
  or what ? 
   ` in 1990 , gorbachev finally admitted soviet guilt and put the blame on `` stalinism . '' ' ( and rightfully so ) . 
  if you want me to look for a text of apology or something go fuck yourself . 
  he did not express any apology . 
  like i already said , contrary to your claim there has never been an official apology . 
  and that 's probably why all you have left is to resort to insults when asked to show it . 
   whoa whoa what makes you so arrogant ? 
  go fuck yourself . 
  le reasoning . 
    so what ? 
  pointed out the denial . 
  that 's what . 
   ` communist party of russian federation ' is n't even ` communist ' by any measure , to begin with ( not that it 's in any way related to the issue ) . 
  ah , no true scotsmen . 
   and cold war era cliches like ` communists not big friends of truth , are they ? ', 
  are not a good look . 
  actually what is not `` a good look '' here is the denial . 
  it 's not cold war any more . 
  and they might look a bit better if they actually acknowledged the truth of the matter instead of denying it . 
  you have now posted this exact same comment five times already . 
  please do consider about when copy-pasta turns into spamming . 
   ( please , do n't show me those well known pictures , you know what they are , and they are easy to set up . ), 
  riiiight , it was all a set up . 
   there are two sides of the story . 
  and one of them is the idiot side with the ` it 's a setup ' conspiratard theory . 
   you know what ? 
  if it was in my power i would totally apologize for everything russians did and did n't just to get it done with . 
  why are ` russians ' as a collective held prisoners by whims of politicians they did n't even elect ? 
  \\* sigh \\* please do read again what i actually wrote , and if you want address that please do . 
   russia officially apologized for katy\u0144 , has n't happened . 
  your linked a news piece says ` russian parliament condemns stalin for katyn massacre ' . 
  now , the duma condemning stalin for something and the government officially apologizing are two very different things . 
  please show me the official apology by soviet or russian government . 
  it does n't exist as there has never been an official apology . 
  and about the denial . 
  for example the russian communist party in the duma still denies it . 
  right in the duma . 
  communists not big friends of truth , are they ? 
  and russia has never accounted for all the victims . 
  their investigation only accounted for 1,803 victims when in reality it 's well known fact that there 's more by a magnitude . 
   that is not a `` big '' crowd . 
  simple as that . 
  then it should be simple to explain what is your metric and how have you determined it ? 
  how many would be a `` big '' crowd and why ? 
   and you know what germans did ? 
  they burned my grandmas village and executed all of her relatives . 
  why ? 
  because they can . 
  and you know what germans also did ? 
  they publicly acknowledged the atrocities done under the nazi regime . 
  they have not denied them from existing . 
  instead they have apologized and made amendments . 
  why ? 
  because that 's the decent thing and the least thing you can do . 
  quite unlike what soviet union/russia has done with their propaganda of denial . 
  and again , he never claimed not having a right to walk about with megaphones . 
  i see you participate in the discussion in a bad faith , so i 'll just bail out just about here . 
  he did n't say that . 
  he said `` citizens of moldova ? 
  yes . '', 
  which is the opposite of what you claim he said . 
  some days ago etna was blowing [ ` smoke ' rings ] ( http://i.imgur.com/sepw8kw.jpg ) cool images in [ this guardian article ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2013/nov/18/mount-etna-volcano-blows-rings-in-pictures ) and over at [ national geographic ] ( http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2013/13/131114-mount-etna-blows-smoke-rings-volcano-italy-science/#/5_73450_990x742.jpg ) . 
  someone also shot a video of them : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbv98z0qp-k, 
   even if i presume that 50 % want to join the eu , it means that the other 50 % does n't . 
  it 's not black or white as there are also ` hard to say ' answers . 
  what the 50 % does mean is that majority supports joining the eu over russia 's union . 
   i would be interested to see graphs from regions like crimea , where 80 % of population is russian . 
  as opposed to southern and eastern regions with more balanced population . 
  sure , grab the goalposts and run with them . 
  your argument rested upon your following belief : `` the main reason for this is ukraine being divided into a pro-west part in the west , and pro-russian part in the south and east , that has 17 million native russian speakers . '',

keeping russia busy ... 
  or baltic sea . 
  i would n't call it phobia , it is a normal reaction towards the world biggest ( area ) country who openly start annexing other countries , or parts of it , see : crimea/ukraine . 
  the east-europeans remember very well the iron curtain and the oppression from soviet union ( russia ) . 
  cold war was a hell , people lived in constant fear of a nuclear holocaust and now russia / putin is targeting those countries again to get them into russia 's `` control '' or influence . 
  they have even a geopolitical plan for that , http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/foundations_of_geopolitics  the foundations of geopolitics : the geopolitical future of russia is a geopolitical book by ** alexander dugin ** . 
  the book has had a large influence within the russian military , police , and statist foreign policy elites [ 1 ] and is used as a textbook in the general staff academy of russian military . 
  [ 1 ]  the book was co-authored by general nikolai klokotov of the general staff academy . 
  [ 1 ] colonel general leonid ivashov , head of the international department of the russian ministry of defence , apparently advised in the project . 
  [ 1 ] klotov stated that in the future the book would `` serve as a mighty ideological foundation for preparing a new military command . '', 
  some examples :  romania , macedonia , `` serbian bosnia '' and greece - `` orthodox collectivist east '' - will unite with the `` moscow the third rome '' and reject the `` rational-individualistic west '' . 
  [ 1 ]  ukraine should be annexed by russia because `` ukraine as an independent state with certain territorial ambitions represents an enormous danger for all of eurasia and , without resolving the ukrainian problem , it is in general senseless to speak about continental politics '' . 
  ukraine should not be allowed to remain independent , unless it is cordon sanitaire , which would be inadmissible . 
  [ 1 ]  finland should be absorbed into russia . 
  southern finland will be combined with the republic of karelia and northern finland will be `` donated to murmansk oblast '' . 
  [ 1 ] i understand very well that after reading that stuff many people will start to rethink russia . 
  that book is not far from declaring a war . 
  and the actions in ukraine are strongly pointing that putin is ready to use military power against its smaller neighbors . 
  and all this just right after the winter olympics . 
  the contrast ca n't be bigger than that . 
  edit , forget the link , add it . 
  russia does n't tell pro-russians to not use force in southeast ukraine . 
  ^ this ^ game ^ is ^ absurd ... 
  ah , yes , soviet union citizens . 
  that was different , estonians who were fighting with finland were not soviet citizens . 
  finns warn estonians and estonians knew themselves too that it was better to get out from finland , because soviet union won and went all the way to germany . 
  and took also estonia . 
  so they flee to sweden , usa etc. 
  estonians were in reality fighting also with themselves : there were estonian troops in the red army and in the german army . 
  and in finnish army ...  in december 1941 , estonian national units were assembled from the men arriving in russia ; by september 1942 , they were joined into the red army 8th estonian rifle corps . 
  in the autumn , the corps consisted of approximately 30,000 men , 85-90 % of whom were estonian . 
  http://www.estonica.org/en/the_estonian_soldiers_in_world_war_ii_in_three_different_uniforms/ but there was also finnish troops in the red army , many finns escaped to russia/ussr after civil war 1916 . 
  hard lessons about independence and war . 
  for both countries . 
  that last `` light news '' was unnecessary . 
  makes you look like a `` persu '' ( basic finn - party member ) . 
  we have much , much more serious problems ahead than that . 
  like the russian nuclear power plant . 
  should we take it ? 
  russia is the only country who wants to build it . 
  france and areva gave it up : they ca n't even get ready the olkiluoto 3 reactor , it is years late . 
  in this situation it is a huge risk . 
  oh , and that `` muslim women police '' - thing was also almost a april joke , `` wtf-who cares '' kinda story . 
  young people do n't give a fuck about that kinda shit , nor the `` spring-hymn '' news . 
  makes me wonder that how old a you and what 's your agenda ? 
  to make finland look like an ass ? 
  source ? 
  because i 'm from finland and never heard about `` large numbers of estonians deported '' to ussr . 
  instead :  however , many nationalist men found it unacceptable to fight against the soviet union for germany . 
  they tried to find a third way , fleeing to finland to avoid the german mobilisation and joining the army there . 
  escapes increased in spring 1943 , when secret mobilisations into the german army started . 
  in february 1944 , the estonian volunteers formed the 200th infantry regiment in the finnish army ( jr 200 ) , with about 2000 men ; about 400 estonians additionally served in the finnish navy . 
  in august 1944 , most of them ( the finnish boys ) returned home , invited by nationalist circles in order to fight the approaching red army . 
  http://www.estonica.org/en/the_estonian_soldiers_in_world_war_ii_in_three_different_uniforms/ of course finland had to give up all war prisoners and defectors and i heard that in these shipments were also people from karelia , baltics etc. 
  and that finns helped some of those to escape and flee ( away from finland ) . 
  but what numbers are you talking about ? 
   no references to `` creative freedom '' and `` national distinctiveness '' can justify the behavior that is considered unacceptable from the standpoint of traditional russian values . 
  this is interesting , icon of the ivan the terrible : http://i.imgur.com/rtoq15d.jpg  on march 2 , 2010 in the presence of russian president dmitry medvedev and french president nicolas sarkozy a russian art exhibition , holy russia , was opened in the louvre ...  the general sponsors of the event were gazprom , gdf suez and total . 
  http://www.gazprom.com/social/supporting-cultural-projects/louvre/ * on that page is a much better icon ( 5mb . jpg ) of ivan the terrible . 
  *  [ ivan terrible ] ... his long reign saw the conquest of the khanates of kazan , astrakhan , and siberia , transforming russia into a multiethnic and multiconfessional state spanning almost one billion acres , approximately 4,046,856 km2 ( 1,562,500 sq mi ) . 
  [ 2 ] ivan managed countless changes in the progression from a medieval state to an empire and emerging regional power , and became the first ruler to be crowned as tsar of all the russias . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ivan_the_terrible also ...  ivan [ terrible ] successfully cemented autocracy and a centralized government and thereby also `` a centralized apparatus of political control in the form of his own guard . 
  '' [ 45 ] the idea of a guard as a means of political control became so ingrained in russian history that it can be traced to peter the great , vladimir lenin , who '' ... [ provided ] russian autocracy with its communist incarnation '' , and joseph stalin , who '' [ placed ] the political police over the party . '', 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ivan_the_terrible#legacy ... and this : russian novelist erofeyev : stalin is 'em bedded in our genes ' http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/novelist-victor-erofeyev-says-stalin-in-genes-of-russia-a-921597.html  erofeyev : stalin has embedded himself in our genes . 
  he tries again and again to rise from the dead . 
  please do n't forget that the best were killed after the october revolution in 1917 : the best aristocrats , the best of the bourgeoisie , the best officers , the best farmers -- even the best workers . 
  we , including myself , are merely the best remnants of the inferior leftovers . 
  a nation with these genes is susceptible to stalin . 
  stalin has also left his mark on my genes . 
  are these thoughts any worth ? 
  we have had two `` leaked '' phone calls here in europe , the first major one was the nulands `` f ** k eu '' call and the second one was where estonian minister said that there might be a possibility that in kiev there was snipers who shot anybody . 
  these affected quite much in europe and made public confused . 
  and the source of those leaks was very possibly russia . 
  they have the ability , thanks to snowden , follow all phone calls too . 
  this `` leak '' is very probably counter - `` propaganda '' and so be it . 
  we have had so much false information and lies from russia . 
  it is only right to tell the world that what we a possibly countering in the near future . 
  `` our troops on the european border are just joking . 
  you see , they are only joking self-defense happy troops passing by and they took crimea using only irony . '', 
   sweden produces its own military equipment quite a lot , making a jet fighter is quite an achievement , sweden builds some ships and submarines , builds ifvs , has mbts . 
  instead of calling that weak , well , i could agree to just saying it 's not capable of fighting russia . 
  during the cold war and little after that , all the swedish military tech was aimed against ussr military tech . 
  swedish air-force was the 4th largest in the world those days :  during the cold war large amounts of money ( including all that had been reserved for swedish nuclear weapons ) were spent on the swedish air force and domestic airplane production . 
  in 1957 sweden had the world 's fourth most powerful air force , [ 4 ] with about 1000 modern planes in front-line service . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/swedish_air_force and it is still a very formidable air-force . 
  also the navy technology is very good . 
  they have developed stealth corvettes and other amazing shit , the anti-ship missiles they produce are best in the world etc. 
  the only thing swedes need to do is push up their ground forces and re-establish a tank brigade or two . 
   i doubt they have any idea what putin is planning . 
  they know pretty much , diplomats are . . were all kgb trained in ussr after all . 
  and these diplomats know that phones are listen and especially their boss ( mr.putin / kgb-fsb ) is listening them ( and others ) . 
  so this `` joking '' about taking `` shitty baltics '' next and then bulgaria , romania ... is not without connections to reality . 
  good . 
  they deserve it . 
  in finland the nato support has slightly gone up , but is still only 22 % . 
  59 % says no . 
  instead finns want to get closer military co-operation with sweden :  finns are ready to align militarily with their western neighbour , sweden . 
  that 's the message from a new poll carried out for yle by taloustutkimus . 
   the survey asked whether people would support a union under which the armed forces of one country would be called on to support the other in a crisis situation . 
  some ** 54 percent said they would support such a union ** , 36 percent opposed it and 10 percent said they did not know .

  i think war and border conflict are a bit different . 
  can they borrow easily due to the sanctions though ? 
  i guess there is always china but even so i ca n't imagine they 'll get great rates . 
  well after the uk actually finds the guts to leave we 'll see what happens , for now nothing has changed . 
  of course we should ... as soon as east ukraine , crimea and mh17 is cleared up . 
  oh look , our favorite moderator of / r/russia , / u/wearebrics, 
   that said all politicans suck balls . 
  true that . 
  the current government of poland might be less than ideal but i 'm sure you 'll elect someone else ( better ) next time  the uk has been consistently , well , less than ideal in regards to the eu . 
  the most troublesome member just voted to leave so it can only get better . 
  well done greece , 
  you 're quite welcome old chap . 
  but probably a few more than 1,000 future jobs sure have been . 
  he is probably refering to that : [ number of jobs advertised in britain falls by over 650,000 post-brexit ] ( http://www.newstalk.com/reader/47.301.343/76726/0/ ), 
  we 'll be waiting !, 
  i for one welcome the soon to be independent country of scotland in to the eu . 
  i hope that means pirate parties and greens get more power and not the far right . 
  i wounder if scottish whisky will get more expensive after brexit , that would be terrible . 
  but does anyone really want him ? 
  how is it looking uncertain ? 
  every poll puts le penn loosing the second round . 
  agreed , but i do n't we need to speed things up at least . 
  if we kick them out they would just fall in to a russia led pact . 
  and yet the only one who seems like a nazi is erdogan . 
  how popular is the current government ? 
  as in the next election do they have chance to remain in power ? 
   start another war i think it 's more about preventing war than starting one . 
  no ... but i do remember once upon a time ... space which had the same character designs . 
  swedish-speaking minority here ; calling us swedish is a god damned insult . 
  we are finnish , not fucking swedish even though a lot of swedes think we moved here from sweden for some reason or another . 
  i fully expect crimea to never leave russia again , still that does n't take anything away from that we should sanction russia over it , keep demanding it . 
  i seem to remember darth vader in ukraine too , at maidan . 
  you could argue that alcohol causes family issues that can very much affect those around you too . 
  what are his views on the eu , nato , and so on ? 
  russia is behaving like it is/part of the ussr again . 
  how about the s-363 ? 
  i mean sure it was a long time ago , but still sets a strong and staying precedent . 
  not claiming it would/did . 
  i 'm pretty sure we are talking about different russian submarines . 
  i only said there was a russian submarine , that is factually correct . 
  why are you so sensitive about the subject ? 
  ah , that one , i was thinking about this russian submarine . 
  i 'm pretty sure it was a russian submarine . 
   since the referendum it 's been nothing but doom and gloom pray tell what are the positives then ? 
   european free-riding of the nato alliance you must be trump supporter . 
  try posting this to / r/russia and see how they respond . 
  i 'd rather not take the chance . 
  i 'm pretty sure they want something to change for the better . 
   if you like it or not they want change . 
  they wanted change for the better , i do n't believe they will get that . 
   if they reviel a plan then it disadvantages them at the negotiation table . 
  well it looks like may is going reveal the plan . 
  taught to every finn in history class . 
  tried cleaning it up a tad . 
  the only place in bulgaria i 've been , cheap vodka . 
  do n't remember much else , that might be because of the cheap vodka . 
  if you think it 's about the state in the us when you read `` russia appears to be taking georgia 's land inch by inch '' then you are probably just ignorant . 
  yeah i saw that , no problem !, 
  ah , see what i was thinking was that it then used ie to download firefox anyway . 
  w10 comes with two ie versions even , so ... one step forward two steps back i guess . 
  so what happens when you pick firefox for example ? 
   microsoft bundling ie with windows serious ( no really ) question ; how else would i get firefox if it did n't come bundled with a browser ? 
  clearly !, 
   still , to this day i do n't understand why he brought 500 $ to school . 
  to show off . 
  you can read why here : http://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/030315/why-did-oil-prices-drop-so-much-2014.asp but i can give you some spoilers if you do n't want to read it ; it had nothing to do with fluctuating currencies . 
  ah , of course , then you are right . 
  gasoline prices did go drastically up . 
  i 'm trying to think of what u.s. made products i buy ... ca n't think of any , so no i ca n't say that i have noticed anything . 
  i guess that depends on how long it lasts . 
  is n't that like a drop of 11.5 % ? 
  surely that will start to show somewhere . 
  i think he wants to know why you hate macron so much . 
  looking forward to how the `` trolls '' will spin this one . 
  hey / u/wearebrics , can i get an unban from / r/russia yet ? 
  like a lot of food things , the reason is simple ; it 's easier . 
  i * could * go get cucumbers , garlic and yogurt , dice the vegetables and mix it or i could just buy the ready made product and be done with it . 
   rainfall has seen an increase in northern europe as someone living in northern europe i can confirm this , it feels like it did n't do anything but rain all summer . 
  oh right , if they are talking about before finland was a country then i 'm much less confused . 
  or finland ? 
  i had no idea we had bisons in europe . 
  fair enough , on both counts . 
  in before some inevitably points out that the fraunhofer institute did not invent the mp3 player . 
  here in finland we have mandatory conscription , so almost every male has been a soldier . 
  so it 's not a big deal here , it 's not even a deal . 
  ( expect every now and then when someone we know begins their conscription and we who have already been there tell them how much harder it was when we where there ) . 
  but then again we 're not risking our lives fighting politicians wars in a foreign nation . 
  so that being said i have no real problem with ` merica giving praise to their soldiers . 
  sure !, 
  we love being studied !, 
  if they would have recently switched to the euro i bet they would be asking that !, 
  he totally should though . 
  shit , i remembered some poll from two or so months ago when they were down to 14 . something , i was sure the trend would have continued . 
   stay with the status quo could very well be . 
   is n't finland starting to feel the recession now ? 
  i think so ... or at least very close to being in a recession . 
   are the pro eu/euro politicians taking a beating in the polls , or is all the same as before ? 
  ~ ~ there is is a shift in the polls , but it 's between two parties that both support the eu and the euro . 
  the most anti eu and anti euro seem to be taking the biggest hit actually . ~ ~, 
  after all the talk in papers , forums , just people around .

  i do n't have to guess any more about unimportant christian holidays if i can get some food or not . 
  like last saturday , traditionally nothing would have been open , but now very nice hypermarkets are . 
  so much simpler . 
  but what about workers in those restaurants , why do people hate them so much ? 
  should n't they be fighting to stop any non-essential services from working during sundays ? 
  why even allow public-transport or taxis ? 
  they have families too ... 
  why should n't those places be closed on sundays too ? 
  would n't it be great for their employees ? 
  i hope people do n't cry when extra judicial killings happen in britain against enemy combatants there . 
  if you want war , you get a war . 
  honestly , why even invade . 
  it 's easy , block all traffic and let them fall over naturally . 
  strong borders are important after all . 
  and the cross border networks , what if they go all in on green energy too ? 
  i wonder if i can get danish ham already ... 
  it does make things somewhat brighter , i have to give that . 
  biggest issue is with that is all roads and almost all walkways are very effectively cleaned from most of the snow . 
  and then either salted or spread with sand or gravel . 
  is n't the optimal conditions for skiing , though in parks and such there can be routes . 
  no , but generally it would be waste of resources to go over each individual in country regularly . 
  information like this allows people who notice any clear suspected discrepancies to report them . 
  ofc police will use this information to investigate if they find something , but they need to know who to investigate first . 
  they are n't clairvoyant ... 
  but does it make sense to have that in every wind turbine ? 
  how much more it cost to include that ? 
  in potentially increased material strength , foundation costs and transportation costs . 
  not to mention that you need to train it for maintenance . 
  alternative is to just make massive concrete pool or dig a hole . 
  both very likely cheaper options due to scaling of volume to height * surface ... 
  so storage wise it makes sense , but engineering ? 
  6 000 cubic meters of water , that is 6000 tons of weight . 
  is it sensible or even best solution ? 
  i 'm not sure if this is so brilliant . 
  from other sub the numbers do n't look very special and then the increased cost and emissions from equipment and towers being able to handle the extra load of water ... 
  public can respond to relevant authorities . 
  and that is a good thing . 
  but to investigate they need to know to look at something . 
  where as with this model any private person who suspects something can check and if things do n't really line up report it . 
  and i 'm also too lazy to spell check for my typos ;d, 
  also : `` i ca n't find that person on internet and i 'm too lazy to go to tax office ... '', 
  not on the list if i found the right name ... 
  probably not that much as this is 2015 data . 
  yep , population matters greatly . 
  maybe we should teach kids that they will die anyway , good practises will postpone it anyway , like not drinking or injecting hard drugs like ethanol ... 
  probably never . 
  seeing how well most people eat up the propaganda . 
  thank you very much for your help against our aggressor in ww2 ... 
  good marketing , a market that is thought to be easy and lucrative , but hard to pierce ... 
  and then someone dies there and you are in prison for a while ... 
  if no one is willing to invest in it and it 's going to self-demolish shortly anyway , it might be cheaper to demolish it now in the safe and right way and possibly save some materials to use in other way . 
  there is potential of hazardous materials too . 
  earl sandwich ? 
  we already have hands full with doing that to estonia ... 
  those nitrates in that meat must be killer , or it 's just way too raw . 
  or am i mistaken ? 
  it does n't have to . 
  the time it rises and drops varies alredy , what difference would it make if it were n't at highest point at 12:00 ? 
  preferably including russia in the other end ... 
  internet , guides , mobile phones ? 
  it 's not like you do n't already read opening times and potential special scenarios when something might be closed during the day . 
  i support this too . 
  i do n't see any reason mid-day needs to be when clock reads 12:00 or midnight when clock reads 24:00 . 
  or work starting when clock reads 8:00 . 
  they are all just numbers , numbers that can be adjusted . 
  using one standard time would make life simpler in the long run . 
  i say we just all move to utc and unlearn our conceptions of morning and midnight corresponding to certain clock number . 
  valetta probably because it 's cleanest and follows heraldic rules closest . 
  also madrid is a horrid mess . 
  this is the main issue . 
  sure you can invest in them , but they just do n't work in scale we need yet . 
  which is why i want more nuclear reactors . 
  they would also allow us to replace fossils for heating . 
  it seems there is an error in the article . 
  it should be 120c and 250f . 
  which would make more sense as 250c is above smoke point of most oils ... 
  this chemical is something that occurs when cooking food at high temperatures . 
  probably even lower . 
  so would valid solution be to limit how food can be cooked , like only boiling it ? 
  for software , if you anyway have to go through ridiculous immigration process why not go to the usa where wages are insane ... 
  if they ca n't beat other competitive areas inside eu gaining good workforce might be hard . 
  and it 's not exactly hard industry to relocate ... 
  i approve of this direction . 
  more ridiculous acts we can gather the better ... 
  one treaty at a time ... 
  so american is qualifier for stuff that is n't real stuff , like cheese ? 
  one could even say that clinton is what usa deserves . 
  sadly it will affect rest of the world too . 
  and anyway do n't uk have nice territories like cayman islands with 0 % tax rate ? 
  why would n't corporations just utilize those ? 
  also : `` government does n't pay anything if i live with my parents '' it 's perverse , but true , you can end up with less if you do n't live alone here ... 
  in espoo i think it was around 281 $ for 12.5 m ^ 2 room with shared bathroom , shower and kitchen couple years ago . 
  currently one price i heard is ~ 470 $ including everything for 38 m ^ 2 studio ... 
  also for over 25 and not student you get reasonable rent paid from welfare ... 
  in finland if you are n't student the state and municipality essentially covers your reasonable rent + heating + water in every case . 
  on other hand also after 25 you are eligible to jobseeker 's allowance too which covers the living and municipality covering the rest to certain livable level ... 
  so essentially even if you are good for nothing your rent is paid by taxes ... 
  is n't islam by definition an extension of judeo-christian culture and as such part of it as sub-level ? 
  symbol of doomsday cult that is responsible for most evil in the known history . 
  sure ... now what is their definition of civilian and would they qualify under it ?

  yet another fucking daily mail article here . 
  heh , a good idea , but maybe there are not enough idiotic hijinks for a new sub . 
  is there a similar area in hungary perceived in such a way ? 
  incidentally , a good part of lahti 's population are descendants of refugees moved from karelia after the war . 
  11 % of finnish population had to move to west . 
  that place is like a mini florida in the sense that if someone does something fully retarded , there 's a very good chance it took place in lahti . 
  great photos .

  language is also the way you share culture . 
  for example , in the first half of 20th century very few people in finland spoke english , but many spoke german and swedish . 
  so all the new ideas we got came from those countries . 
  when we looked for examples on how to write our laws , how to structure our nation , we looked at those countries because we could understand what they were doing . 
  today , most speak english but very few speak german . 
  thus when doing research or talking politics , earlier examples are often sought in anglo-saxon countries , even if culturally more apt examples could be found from estonia or sweden . 
  in finnish political conversation when talking of immigration , the examples are often taken from britain , even though sweden would be better example . 
  with copyright , we are looking examples from usa even though germany has the same legislation system . 
  and so on . 
  languages affect how ideas spread . 
  not historian , but i do n't think it 's only due to soviet armies why the iron curtain fell at the border of slavic language group . 
  so the border of language is often also the border of ideas . 
  like what 's proper way of doing thing , should television only be entertainment or should it be part of cultural integration etc. 
  tl ; dr : saying that finland would be finland even without finnish language is like saying iowa would still be iowa with communist constitution , another flag and another history . 
  while i 'm not exactly an expert on the subject , there 's a situation where area does n't produce any music , stories etc. 
  of its own but relies blindly on imports . 
  what a strange question . 
  i would rather ask the opposite . 
  well , that was nonsensical . 
  why should we not aid our local industry ? 
  lots of benefits in keeping it operational , nothing but negatives in letting it fall . 
  operation is even relatively cheap . 
  and is n't like american films never get any tax cuts or other aid from the federal government or individual states . . 
   or game of thrones , the wire , seinfeld etc. 
  no we need more eurovision . 
  all the above are great shows . 
  they are balanced by local shows . 
  variation is the balance of every good diet . 
   as he types on an american created and based website in english . 
  after writing in finnish for eight hours . 
  as i said , variation . 
  anyway , hanging in reddit gives me perspective . 
  it 's dangerous to assume the whole world thinks like i do . 
  it 's a bit of both . 
  hard to explain . 
  i 'm interested ( and sometimes write for pay ) of comics , i dabble in politics and have studied sociology . 
  walking dead/garage wars example is well known to me because it happens to be the centre of a venn diagram of those three subjects . 
  the situation is connected to how fox operates in finland . 
  they basically bought the corpse of a dead tv-station two years back , got some special temporary allowances that the other stations do n't have and proceeded to run a station on walking dead on prime-time , ancient aliens after that and the rest of the day garage wars on loop . 
  it 's the only channel in finland that can do that . 
  and they probably not for long . 
   which languages get the preference ? 
  you could n't possibly teach all european languages to every school child in europe . 
  you do n't have to . 
  you just have to make sure that the taught languages overlap with what they teach in other countries ( every european should speak at least three languages , says eu ) . 
  if you understand english , swedish , russian , german , french and spanish you should be able to survive anywhere . 
  learning even half gives you so much overlap that you should survive in most situations . 
  the important languages are english , french , german and russian . 
  basically english and something else . 
  i speak finnish as native language , english more-or-less excellently , i have passable swedish and i can read estonian and most other scandinavian languages without much trouble . 
  i can read some german and french ( try to figure out more , but i was never good with languages and i did n't pick these up at school -- but i 'm reaching the level where i can read comics without dictionary ) . 
  most finns do better than i do . 
  my father is native-language level in english , french , spanish , portuguese and swedish in addition to finnish . 
  my brothers speak german in addition to swedish and english . 
   you make your choice to maintain your native language finnish is the whole heart of the nation . 
  if we had lost it , we would now just be parts of russia and sweden . 
  i would be ok with the latter but not the former . 
  so being able to speak thing language that 's somewhat unique is an important part of being who i am . 
  the language gives a certain shared mind-space , certain values and assumptions . 
  losing the language would mean losing all that , not to mention our history . 
  as i said , this language is our soul in very real sense of the word . 
   you have to accept the consequences of this is a world of larger cultural empires . 
  if were born in america , i would only speak english and perhaps know few words of spanish . 
  now i speak three and understand on different levels few more . 
  most people my age do even better . 
  i think we can manage ok . 
  if the price of this is that we have to regulate our tv-stations that much more carefully and push few million euros toward film production now and again , that is n't a very large price for being multi-lingual nation . 
  they often show five episodes in a row . 
  what 's not to hate ? 
  or then we can try make sure that we get programming in several languages and then teach the same languages in schools . 
  losing our native language for global markets is n't worth the cost . 
  it 's like losing your soul for a big mac meal . 
  for some reasons americans are n't interested in subtitled shows and dubbing rises the prices too much . 
   so europe is unwilling to invest , to build up it 's own entertainment industry ... european corporations . . or this particulal case i 'm referring to , fox finland . 
   ... and you blame america for that ? 
  i do n't think i 've blamed america for that ? 
  i 've simply noted that this is the situation due to calculations done by some tv-studio heads here in finland and the rest of the eu , and this regulation is how we avoid being hurt by it . 
   should n't you be blaming your own country 's entrepreneurs and corporations instead of us ? 
  i am . 
  that 's why i am so enthusiastic about the regulations ( when they work -- fox got some special allowance for 2012/2013 which makes them a very good example of how all channels would look like if the regulation would be abandoned ) . 
   you ca n't get rid of one and keep the other . 
  sure i can . 
  we artificially cut the broadcast time in half , making it necessary for the studio to show only the stuff they think the public finds most interesting . 
  then we put them choosing the other half from european programming . 
  again , they can choose whatever they like inside these limits . 
  if they think that what people want to see is garage wars , then they can show garage wars . 
  but i bet they opt showing walking dead . 
  the regulation is n't banning any programming , you note . 
   almost as selfish and conceited as banning foreign art because you 're `` afraid '' it 'll `` take over your culture '' . 
  why did you put that in quotation marks ? 
  shows like garage wars were bundled on other shows like walking dead ( in this case i know they were in the same bundle ) . 
  so if you buy latter you also get the former . 
  so if the station is dead-set in getting the latter , you get the first one `` for free '' . 
  and when you put commercials on free content , you 're making money even if only very few people turn up to watch the show . 
   yes , i understand . 
  you 're afraid . 
  you 're afraid of globalization . 
  you 're afraid of loosing your identity because your local film industry ca n't compete . 
  of course . 
  national identity is precious thing   you 're willing to ignore the good and focus on the bad if it advances your point .

  you think you care ? 
  you do n't give a shit . 
  no , integration means you hold some aspects of your own culture , but try to melt into the culture around you . 
  for example , yesterday i was sitting in the train when a young guy who i believe was ( dark-skinned ) indian asked if he could sit next to me since the train was full . 
  i replied and moved over to give him room . 
  for the rest of the trip ( about half an hour ) both of us just sat there minding our own business , listening to music and playing with our phones . 
  because that 's how it is in finland . 
  we mind our own business . 
  it 's respectful . 
  integration means that you still hold some cultural aspects of your native country , but also value cultural aspects of your new home as well . 
  also , same day , i walked past a thai lady who was talking on the phone ... in swedish !, 
  i ca n't even speak swedish properly and it 's our second official language . 
  but she did . 
  here 's an example of a person who is very well integrated . 
  he values both his somali culture and finnish culture . 
  wow , nice jump to conclusions . 
  nice try , murica . 
  for fucks sake , [ broken telephone ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/chinese_whispers ) much ? 
  because that means yielding to putin and russia . 
  it 's another goddamn cold war . 
   let 's assume you are a syrian man , which faction would you fight for ? 
  that 's fair . 
  but what about all the others ? 
  it 's not just syrians who are coming , what 's their excuse ? 
  stubb says plenty of shit ... / r/punchablefaces, 
  or the article itself is wrong ? 
  finnish media says nothing about this being about refugees . 
  * checks flair * i see . 
  alrighty then ... 
  `` old '',

  in finland one of our authors threw the bible to the floor ( intentionally ) .

  now imagine if he did the same with the quran . 
   grimsgaard-ofstad posted on facebook in january that he had arrived in the syrian town of idlib , although why he was there has yet to be determined . 
  his facebook page includes many photographs of ancient sculptures and ruins . 
  is it wrong that i have no sympathy for idiots ? 
  i saw plenty of transgender women in thailand . 
  why did n't they spare me from the shock ? 
  there 's the racists and xenophobes who see nothing , but terrorists . 
  there 's the hippie world huggers who see nothing , but innocent children . 
  then there 's people like us in the middle ground who ca n't believe people are so crazy ... 
  `` refugees are the new gays '' though i support same-sex marriage , the shield shining and ego-boosting on social media is fucking crazy . 
  did n't you hear ?

  are there any blond syrians ? 
   how would you react if someone told you you were n't allowed to go where you pleased ? 
  seriously ? 
  you 're not allowed to go where you please . 
  no one is . 
  `` well fuck , nothing i can do ... : / '' would be my reaction . 
  to be fair , it 's a civil war . 
  there is no army to fight for at the moment unless you want to pick sides . 
  still . 
  if that 's what `` multiculturalism '' leads to i say fuck it . 
  we 're just creating an `` us vs them '' environment inside countries . 
  eventually that will burst and our children will have civil wars in their hands .

  where the fuck are they know ? 
   200000 for finland you 've got no idea how badly our economy is struggling at the moment . 
  we 're gon na have pretty damn big strikes soon . 
  white guilt . 
  sooo much white guilt . 
  yeah . 
  it 's the perfect plan . 
  europe will be on it 's toes and tensions will tighten . 
  got ta give it to these bastards . 
  they 're not dumb . 
  depends where the immigrant comes from . 
  in finland somalians commit way more crimes than locals . 
  however i think it was iranians who actually commit less than native finns . 
  of course they would .

  you can only have so many `` highly trained troops '' who all get wiped out within the first week of combat like japanese airmen against the us navy . 
  when you are talking about a total war scenario you can never have enough manpower , and you will deplete your active troop level fairly quickly . 
  the problems that most european countries suffer is a lack of manpower for their military . 
  whether it be the nordic countries , eastern european countries or central european countries , their populations will never match russia 's 125 million troop level . 
  they need conscription to fill the essential roles in their military , they are not trading off `` highly trained troops '' . 
  the problem with `` highly trained troops '' is you only have a limited number of them . 
  when war breaks out , most likely half of your `` highly trained troops '' will be mia and you ca n't defend your country because you made the choice not to train the rest of your population with military training . 
  government does n't give a crap as long as you pay taxes . 
  it is ridiculous how costly financial crimes are in finland though . 
  little ironic that the state has been banning western foods under the pretext of `` not meeting food standards . '', 
  finland exports large amounts of its food to russia but under sanctions it has of course slide down . 
  another reason to reduce gun control / s, 
  you can always have conventional deterrence without nuclear weapons . 
  st. petersburg and moscow are within range of european conventional artillery systems . 
  conscription is necessary when you do n't have enough personnel to fill in your ranks , even with good pay . 
  and just because we are in the twenty first century does not mean conventional warfare does n't apply . 
  the vast majority of russia 's military hardware and doctrine is still reliant on conventional tactics , and as shown in the russo-georgian war and ukraine crisis , countries with weak conventional arms can lose land pretty easily . 
  34,000 highly trained professionals wo n't do much against even against 150,000 conscripts , and if there was a war in the european theater it will most likely take place in a large scale land battle . 
  land battles require fielding of large infantry units regardless , along with logistics . 
  wars have been won plentiful by poorly trained grunts . 
  vietnam , soviet invasion of afghanistan , six days war . 
  if europe is going to be attacked * no doubt * it will take place in the conventional field , and when its total defense of the host country you 'd be silly to do away with conscription . 
  i do n't see how handing out more nuclear weapons will provide more deterrence . 
  hybrid warfare can just as easily make a scenario where nuclear weapons can not be used in uncertainly . 
  india-pakistan have a very unstable relationship , both with nuclear weapons and they 're stuck in a standstill . 
  would n't it be fine for countries like the uk , germany , italy , france , and other strong nato members who are away from chaos to have nuclear weapons ? 
  if i am correct , in nato nuclear deterrence is covered by article 5 . 
  i think its a good idea for countries to at least reinstate conscription to show they are serious . 
  finland , austria , and switzerland all have conscription , and they are neutral countries without nato . 
  the only nato countries that have conscription ( most of it selective ) is denmark , norway , greece , lithuania , and estonia . 
  and frankly conscription in those countries ( geopolitical ) wo n't do much for a game changer . 
  why does it matter what a country pays % for gdp ? 
  a country with a big economy ( like germany , # 1 in germany ) can afford to pay a smaller percentage of gdp to military and it can still be on par with economies smaller than its size ( like the uk ) that spend have to spend more . 
  germany and the uk virtually have [ comparable military ] ( http://www.globalfirepower.com/countries-comparison-detail.asp?form=form&amp;country1=germany&amp;country2=united-kingdom&amp;submit=compare ) in terms of quantity of equipment and personnel but germany has to pay substantially less than the uk for the same bang for the buck . 
  another reason why the uk pays much more for its military because it wants a [ overseas presense ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_with_overseas_military_bases#japan ) with over a dozen military bases while germany currently operates non outside of its territory . 
  again it has to do with different philosophy , germany still relies on soft power and is wiry about military force due to its history . 
  no one is forcing the uk to pay alot for its defense or keep oversea bases , same as no one is forcing the us to spend 3.5 % of its gdp on military expenditures . 
  countries like the uk do that voluntary because they want to maintain their prestige as a military power , that has n't stopped since the end of the british empire through the cold war . 
  and if i recall the united states operates around a dozen [ air force bases in the uk ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_states_air_force_in_the_united_kingdom ) and the uk itself has a distinguished modern air force that requires no assistance . 
  its much easier for allies to work together if they have joint bases in which they can operate in a theater . 
  and with the uk leaving the eu ; and possibility losing its economic and political title , it may not want to sacrifice its military prowess . 
  i 'm not an englishmen but thats my two cents . 
  you know the uk does n't even reach 2 % either . 
  its around ~ 1.9 if you remove non-defense related spending . 
  france and italy do their share . 
  france actually spends more on their military than the uk in terms of gdp per military spending . 
  and france has actually done operations in mali by itself practically . 
  the uk needs to hitch a ride with the us for its major operations nowdays . 
  same reason why us p-8 posiden planes had to do anti-submarine operations near the uk since the uk did n't have any available at the time . 
  the question is ~ ~ can the uk defend canada ~ ~, 
  whoa finland , we said we were n't a nato country !, 
  nato and a `` eu '' army is practically the same thing . 
  26 of 28 of nato members are european , and the whole point of nato in the first place was to be an ~ ~ anti-russian ~ ~ anti-communist bloc to secure europe . 
  not sure why an `` eu '' army would be any different , member states would have to combine their military industrial complexes and increase spending but its doable . 
  yeah , its sad that geopolitics in the past basically stays with you as a stain you can never unwash . 
  even though finland did n't exactly ` win ' against russia in wwii , if we were annexed like the baltics that would have repercussions for us in the present . 
  http://money.cnn.com/2014/11/12/media/cnn-russia-broadcasts/ new legislation was in place . 
  pundits say it was related to the 2014 ukraine crisis . 
  probably in the same ball park of russia mysteriously banning polish foods for ` not meeting standards ', 
  thats what i meant , i guess i meant blue water as the ability to access the open ocean . 
  but but b - they need their cars, 
  na man that would be * russophobia * and fueling the * new cold war *, 
  saddam was pretty devious in his [ purges ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oynp5pnvwos ) as well . 
  ( not exactly sure why christopher hitchens is narrating this ), 
  jesus christ this is an actual purge . 
  well when there was that submarine scare in sweden , they did use their mine layer fleet and start dropping depth charges . 
  but more or less likely that was done as a warning , than an actual goal intended to sink russian submarines . 
  the uk would be included too , since the uk houses dozens of us airfields and a joint nuclear submarine base . 
  looks like its only france . 
  viva la france !!!, 
  the whole point of nato was to be an anti-communist ( russian ) block . 
  and no doubt russia is consistently a geopolitical challenge for the eu and the enlargement of the eu . 
  i would argue the us through the years has gotten to see nato as a nuisance from diverting forces back to europe when they should be focused on their pivot to asia . 
  its in the best interest of all european and nato members for turkey to be stable . 
  it is a gatekeeper to one of the two blue water ports russia has and is a good buffer between civilized europe and the chaos that is the middle east . 
  [ `` coalition of the willing '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/coalition_of_the_willing ) i 'm sure if turkey would be at war countries like france and germany would come up with a clever excuse to not participate as in iraq . 
  if you can ignore the us in nato surely you can ignore turkey . 
  yeah , those ~ ~ western english ~ ~ americans really have nothing going for them . 
  eh , the us is still the # 2 exporter, 
  maybe assad and erdogan are keeping all the good ones !, 
  i watched that debate on the refugee crisis . 
  i learned absolutely nothing from it . 
  inger st\u00f8jberg is dank though < 3, 
  the real question is ~ ~ why did n't they take the fucking shot ~ ~, 
  the real question is ~ ~ why did n't they take the fucking shot ~ ~, 
  well , * we technically already have did n't we ? 
  * although finland was not occupied by germany we were their allies during operation barbarossa . 
  kind of sucks , maybe if there was some way there could be a connector between helsinki and tallinn . 
  does n't estonia have very large shale oil reserves or something ? 
  can not be self sufficient on that ? 
  yeah , except finland has more similarity in terms of geography and culture with the nordics . 
  estonia could probably make it into nordics if it did n't have the history involving the ussr and all . 
  finnish & estonian language is similar . 
  honesty we just need a excluded area for the nuclear waste to be stored . 
  it could be like renting storage . 
  finland is actually building the worlds first nuclear waste storage facility in a coastal island underground . 
  * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/onkalo_spent_nuclear_fuel_repository * http://www.reuters.com/article/us-finland-nuclear-iduskcn0t121120151112 it could turn up to be a big profit idea , seeing that many world powers such as russia & the us need a place to down their waste in low profile . 
  problem is finland is still reliant on russian gas , and the majority of northern europe relies on russia for uranium for our nuclear power . 
  unless there is a big push for renewable energies , this probably wo n't change . 
  finland could continue to use biowood for its fuel source but it gives off an awful lot of pollution .

  wikipedia points to this : http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/09/greece-tax-evasion-professional-classes ... but this is much more readable : http://www.economist.com/blogs/freeexchange/2012/09/tax-evasion-greece, 
   i believe the arguments put forward by the imf , according to imf , greek debt was viable last january . 
  it is still viable , if there was political will to pay it back . 
  i hope greeks can still shop 7 sundays a year . 
   there is no supranational tax system there is , and it is called vat . 
  greeks do not want to pay it , either . 
  and that is what the tax office reports to greek statistics office and eurostat . 
   the greeks are both poorer and richer than their counterparts in ce . 
  there is awfully lot of greek lawyers , doctors , accountants , etc. 
  who earn less than 5000 $ per year . 
   and greeks are having the balls to make history and paying for this decision on their skin . 
  if you think this has a happy ending , you have n't been paying attention . 
   the only left party actually having the balls to change this system . 
  the only left party with balls was spd . 
  they actually changed their system . 
  that 120 $ is her pension from the time she worked in germany . 
  she probably gets greek pension , too . 
  `` as of 2013 , sunday shopping has been allowed up to seven times per year . '', 
  beware of hellenic tiger . 
  according to [ the oecd report ] ( http://www.oecd.org/eco/growth/going-for-growth-greece-2015.pdf ) , they are still lagging both eu and oecd average by a large margin . 
   according to imf , greece ran a cyclically adjusted budget surplus of over 5 % in 2014 . 
  that number is a forecast based on troika surplus requirement and a imf model of greek economy . 
  according to another imf model , there was some 10 % bubble in greek economy because of extravagant public spending , that is , without budget deficits and foreign loans greece gdp would have been 10 % lower even if all the greek resources have been fully utilized . 
  of course , krugman flatly denies that it is even possible . 
  there was a country to rescue and banks to save . 
  bailouts were supposed to do both . 
  do you think that tsipras and varoufakis are selling out their own country ? 
  they are shortsighted populist who play with jingoistic tendencies of their people , but do they intend to sell their home country ( and why ) ? 
  this is what the long-time friendship with russia is . 
  russian trade helps to keep the timber prices lower in finland . 
  forestry companies have overextended in finland , they can not get enough finnish timber for reasonable prices . 
  not many eu countries can import raw timber efficiently for russia . 
  russia tried to put an export tariff on timber already in . . eh . . 
  2007 ? , probably because someone close to putin or his pocket wanted to lower logging tariffs paid to russian government , but that backfired because there was nobody to do any logging in karelia but finnish companies . 
   100 % copy of the same plan germany received post-ww2 cool , we are dividing the occupation zones , right ? 
  i believe the finnish forces would prefer islands , preferably with short ferry connections or international-grade airports . 
  certainly importing food and medicine is prioritized and the efficient greek civil service will issue permits for transactions promptly so the imports can continue probably already in march 2017 . 
  soviet ruble a strong currency ? 
  finnish and swedish systems are pretty close to each other , the minimum wage is defined in the collective agreement . 
  so you can walk to k market and work for 3 $ per hour if you do something that pam agreement does not cover , like distribute leaflets from door to door . 
   how much is the minimum wage for lowest paid jobs like cleaning or newspaper delivery ? 
  there is no minimum wage in sweden . 
   he is just asking his people about what they really want since the outcome would be out of his electoral promises . 
  tsipras himself disagrees with you . 
  `` the most democratic way of expressing the popular will is elections , not a referendum . '', 
  i gather this `` institutional deficit '' means inefficient justice system , police , customs , electricity and water infrastructure ? 
  these wikipages seem to list the measures that the greek government has agreed to implement . 
  is there a list of reforms that they have actually implemented ? 
  krugman do n't believe that greek economy was operating 10 percent above capacity when greek was running a deficit of 10 % of gdp . 
  i do n't believe krugman a minute . 
  here you go : http://greece.greekreporter.com/2015/06/27/what-tsipras-had-stated-about-the-greek-referendum-in-2011/, 
  i heard that was the proposal they were working on when tsipras finished the negotiations and left for athens . 
  finnish parliament has its last session today on tuesday before fall . 
  they were ready for an extra session on monday . 
  tsipras on referendum :  `` you know better than me that if the greek prime minister himself tries to have the people face such dilemmas , the real default will be inevitable , and the greek banks and the greek economy will collapse before we even reach the voting booth . 
  just because of the possibility that the people may face such a dilemma , they might vote `` no . ''  tsipras had then accused prime minister of despair and had characterized his announcement of a referendum as a `` disaster for the greek economy '' and a `` harbinger of bankruptcy , '' considering it a trick used by the greek government in its effort to buy more time in power . 
  and he had come into the following conclusion : `` the most democratic way of expressing the popular will is elections , not a referendum . '', 
  the porsche se , yes . 
  they own more than half of the company and have sat on the vag board since 1937 . 
   uk terms illegal manipulation going on , you mean someone who actually owned shares did not want to sell them ?

  last i heard every ez member exports quite a lot of stuff . 
  the eurozone inflation is currently 0.3 % and ecb flooding the market with qe money in order to push inflation towards the target of 2 % . 
  a little bit of devaluation would be great help everywhere . 
  do you realise that `` massive hammering of euro '' is just what all the ez leaders want ? 
  cheaper euro means more jobs at home and more votes in the next elections . 
  we need closer look . 
  i only read a economist piece that 1 ) complained about capital controls and claimed that 2 ) controls were mostly lifted for vacationers and students this june . 
   how is finlands economic suffering caused only by the euro ? 
  the forest industry has been used to enjoy roughly the same exchange rates as our competition in sweden . 
  for a couple of years after 2008 euro was slightly too expensive for our exports . 
  however , the current crisis in greece devalues euro and makes finnish exports cheaper . 
  the real problem , however , was nokia . 
  it was like north sea gas in netherlands , during the best nokia years salaries and wages grew obscenely and public sector get so fat it could not cope when nokia and electronic industry all but disappeared . 
   when iceland implemented capital controls in 2008 iceland still has capital controls , but they lifted the most strict controls this june ( 2015 ) . 
    in 2009 , there were 952,625 public employees but in 2013 their number fell to 675,530 .

   the loaned money is created out of nothing and lent with interest . 
  money is created by trust . 
  a depositor trusts bank to pay back the deposit and thus creates more money . 
  the money disappears when the trust is lost and the deposits are cashed . 
   long-term it 's their best option . 
  in long term we are all dead . 
  germans proposed referendum already in may but tsipras shot it down . 
  no taxation without representation !, 
   clientelism 700 000 public servants hardly count as oligarchs . 
  then you are stuck to eurozone . 
   printing money is not catastrophic if done properly . 
  yes . 
  if your budget can keep up . 
  otherwise , welcome capital control , price control , wage control and when they fail , hyperinflation .

  this was on reddit same day the tapanila case : http://www.motherjones.com/mojo/2006/04/senate-presidents-son-sodomizes-18-boys-not-charged-sexual-assault  those committing these crimes should be tried and convicted the same way a finnish person would be dealt with . 
  if the boys in tapanila case had a decent attorney ( and had they been white ) , there would have been no rape but a third-degree assault . 
  this must be contagious .

  where are you from ? 
  the two smaller sami languages are n't doing very well , the karelian language is kinda dying out , the finnish roma dialect is pretty irrelevant because only roma speak it , almost no one speaks yiddish and the tatar language is really small too . 
  no , it 's definitely this one : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_afrozersnk&amp;t=1m14s, 
  it 's kinda boring , and i rarely watch it . 
  it 's too long and most of the songs are quite uninteresting . 
  i think [ this ] ( https://www.suomela.fi/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/vanhan-talon-kosteusongelmat.jpg ) is the most common type . 
  good point . 
  being friends with russia is a good thing , and it would be very unwise indeed to piss off such a powerful country with a great army . 
  but the truth is , that russia is a corrupted oligarchy that 's lead by a man who does n't give a shit about human rights or the sovereignty of the neighboring countries . 
  russia started a war with ukraine , and they may start another war with any of their neighboring countries . 
  we do n't know who 's putin will decide to invade the next time he feels that a victorious war might be good for his popularity . 
  the music !, 
   it 's a bit strange to me how funerals in a lot of places are a week or more after the person 's death . 
  here it 's usually 1 or 2 days later . 
  maybe it 's because portugal is relatively small , so guests do n't need a long time for traveling . 
  well , that 's a bit less horrible . 
  one hymn that 's often sung at funerals is [ * maa on niin kaunis * ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a1ow0jeewsa ) ( the earth is so beautiful ) . 
  it 's technically a christmas song , but it 's also a great song for funerals , because it discusses things like time , and the passing of generations . 
  here 's my translation of the lyrics : - the earth is so beautiful and the lord 's heaven is bright wonderful is the souls ' pilgrimage road we travel singing through the world , our journey takes our towards heaven - time flies years go by generations of men are forgotten the souls ' heavenly song remains the same - the angels were the first who sang to the shepherds the sound echoes from soul to soul glory be to the lord , the earth is peaceful for jesus brought us grace !, 
  i only know about lutheran funerals . 
  this is how it works : the guests arrive to the chapel where the coffin is . 
  the coffin is in front of the altar , and the coffin lid is always closed . 
  everyone sits down , the immediate family sits closest to the coffin . 
  the priest blesses the deceased and drops some sand on the coffin lid . 
  the priest often reads some bible verses , and the guests sing some hymns . 
  the guests place their flowers and wreaths on the coffin either in the chapel , or at the grave . 
  six people , usually close male friends and family members , carry the coffin to the grave . 
  the deceased is always carried feet first . 
  they lower the coffin into the grave , and the priest then everyone goes to the `` remembrance reception '' ( * muistotilaisuus * ) where coffee and pastries is usually served . 
  if the guests have come from a long distance , food is often served , especially in the countryside . 
  everyone talks about the deceased , and share fond memories of him or her . 
  people read [ `` adresses '' ] ( https://www.google.fi/search?q=adressit&amp;client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0ahukewi1w42kt-3tahxmfzokhbjxa9wq_auibigb&amp;biw=1444&amp;bih=751 ) which are short messages that have been sent by friends of the deceased , to express their condolences .

  mannerheim was never a dictator . 
  he was a regent of finland for a while , but that 's not the same thing . 
  after the finnish civil war mannerheim was elected temporary regent of finland . 
  in july 1919 , after he had confirmed a new republican constitution , mannerheim stood as a candidate in the first presidential election , supported by the national coalition party and the swedish people 's party . 
  he lost the election to the president of finland to kaarlo juho st\u00e5hlberg . 
  he also had some 30,000 people tortured . 
  i 've posted this in another message , but this is what they did to political prisoners : ( warning nsfl , nsfw , very graphic depiction of torture ) * `` the rape of women was common , including sexual torture such as the insertion of rats into genitals and `` unnatural acts involving dogs . '', 
  detainees were forcibly immersed in vats of urine and excrement . 
  beatings with gun butts , fists and chains were routine ; one technique known as `` the telephone '' involved the torturer slamming `` his open hands hard and rhythmically against the ears of the victim , '' leaving the person deaf . 
  at villa grimaldi , prisoners were dragged into the parking lot and had the bones in their legs crushed as they were run over with trucks . 
  '' * how can you admire a man who did this ? 
  you admire pinochet ? 
  what the fuck ? 
  during pinochet 's rule , as many as 30,000 people were tortured . 
  this is what they did to political prisoners : ( warning nsfl , nsfw , very graphic depiction of torture ) * `` the rape of women was common , including sexual torture such as the insertion of rats into genitals and `` unnatural acts involving dogs . '',

  why the hell do you admire pinochet ? 
  do you know what he did ? 
  mannerheim was n't a dictator ? 
  and more importantly , why the hell do you admire fucking pinochet ? 
  the man was a sadistic tyrant guilty of horrible crimes against his own people !, 
  wait , you mean our carl gustaf emil mannerheim ? 
  when was he a dictator ? 
  here it 's the same . 
  helsinki - spoiled rich hipster snobs who think they 're better than everyone else turku - close-minded , arrogant idiots tampere - really , really slow people lohja - there 's a saying that goes : `` better to have a fist up your ass than to live in lohja '', 
  would the correct word be occupied ? 
  i meant that no foreign power ever took control of finland . 
  finland was never successfully occupied or invaded by anyone . 
  we hate this country , but it 's still better than all the other countries . 
  but finland did n't join the axis during winter war . 
  it joined the axis during the continuation war which was after operation barbarossa . 
  they 're okay already . 
  it 's okay , but regular butter is better , especially with cheese . 
  finns were relatively lucky in ww2 because unlike almost all the other countries , finland was never occupied . 
  so the civilian population was mostly safe except for the bombing raids of course . 
  the only tragedies that i know of were men who died in the war . 
  i do n't know about anyone dying in my family , but i 've heard stories from other families . 
  there was one family that had four sons . 
  three of them died in the winter war , and the fourth one died in the continuation war . 
  i 've also heard a story about a man from my grandparent 's village . 
  during the continuation war the finland was allies with nazi-germany , and there were lots of german soldiers in finland . 
  now , the man from my grandparent 's village liked germans , and he made lots of german friends . 
  he would often give the german soldiers bread and stuff . 
  well , eventually it became evident that the soviet union would win the war , and the leaders of the finnish army wanted to make peace with the soviet union , so they would n't completely destroy finland . 
  the germans did n't want to make peace with the soviet union , hitler believed that they could still win . 
  finland made a peace agreement with the soviet union , and stalin demanded that finns force the germans to leave finland . 
  the germans of course did n't want to leave , so there was a war between finns and the germans called the lapland war . 
  the man from my grandparent 's village who liked germans ended up getting killed by one . 
  edit : i changed the word `` invaded '' to the more accurate `` occupied '', 
  i like the savonian dialect , it sounds very jovial and chill , but also a bit wry and smug .

  neekeri , for example , was n't originally a racist word but it became one so mulatti might have become one as well .

  why do you hate your surname , if you do n't mind me asking ? 
  mine is a bit inconvenient at times because it has letter ' \u00e4 ' , but i do n't really hate it . 
  there are roughly 6000 people who share my surname . 
  my mother 's surname is used only in that family so it 's rare name . 
  [ the finnish population centre offers a search engine for finnish names ] ( https://verkkopalvelu.vrk.fi/nimipalvelu/default.asp?l=3 ) , that will tell you the popularity . 
  for a reference the name korhonen is the most popular surname in finland and 23144 persons have it . 
  quite common . 
  2015 there were 2 656 000 households in finland and in 2016 they had 502 900 `` kes\u00e4m\u00f6kki / sommarstuga `` s , ( which translates as summer cottage ) . 
  i could n't find the number of households in 2016 but i doubt that there has been a drastic change from 2015 . 
  it 's not totally uncommon to have `` american cousins '' , but not so common that you could say that every family has one . 
  i personally no two families who have relatives in the usa . 
  it is far more common to have relatives that emigrated to sweden in the 1960 's and 1970 's . 
  i found a one article from 2016 where it said that netflix has nearly a million weekly audience and that the streaming service ( yle areena ) of the finnish broadcasting corporation is the most popular one . 
  the most popular programme in yle areena to date has been the norwegian teen series skam , which has had around a quarter of a million views per episode . 
  streaming services are on the rise but i did n't find any other figures than the netflix one . 
  in finland you can get streaming services from our local tv-stations , netflix and hbo nordic . 
  maybe others but i 'm not sure .

  beat the rugs and place them back on the floors .

  because i was brought-up in a culture where it would be considered impolite not to tell if the other asks how you are - hence , you do not ask how they are if you are not interested their well being . 
  if i greet someone with a phrase : ` hei , mit\u00e4 kuuluu ? ', 
  ( hey , how are you ) , i will expect them to answer how they are . 
  edit : naturally i use this with people i already know . 
  if i do n't want to know how they are , i 'll just say ` hei ' or ` moi ' , perhaps ` p\u00e4iv\u00e4\u00e4 ' if it is semi-formal situation or ` hyv\u00e4\u00e4 p\u00e4iv\u00e4\u00e4 ' if it is a formal situation . 
  hyv\u00e4\u00e4 p\u00e4iv\u00e4\u00e4 means literally good day .

  in finland i believe that shops do have a legal right to add the costs of card payments to the customer 's bill but none do to my knowledge . 
  and there usually are no limits how small amount you can pay by card . 
  on the contrary , you can see signs that say that the shop does not accept notes above 50 euro value . 
  nope , in finland we have , by law , product information in finnish and swedish . 
  so when i was in sweden i assumed that you too would have them in both languages . 
  as it turned out - you do n't . 
  i believe her point was that you do n't do the finnish thing and start telling people how you are , 
  and one of the few thing that i do remember from my french classes is , that the only appropriate answer is : ca va bien . 
  i was visiting a relative in sweden somewhere near gothenburg and i was baffled by the fact that none of the products had any finnish on them . 
  i remember turning a milk carton in my hands trying to find the finnish text . 
  i was so used to having text both in finnish and swedish . 
  i find it odd that they do n't always seem to understand differences between monarchies . 
  no european monarchy is an absolute monarchy , but sometimes when you read the comments , it is as if some americans do n't know the difference between denmark and brunei . 
  for some reason we have quite a number of different animal species as national animal , like [ national horse breed ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/finnhorse ) , [ national butterfly ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/holly_blue ) , [ national fish ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_perch ) etc. 
  people usually remember our national bird , which is whooper swan and national animal , which is bear . 
  but i must say that i personally associate bear with russia , not finland . 
  i think they were but to be honest i 'm not sure . 
  i do remember that a smaller shop that sold snuss had text in finnish , but i 'm not sure about a large ica if they had or not . 
  i do wonder how they came up a roll with a pizza stuffing from the original one .

  edit : i did n't know that , 
  it * seems * so because you use some old common words , like ` suvi ' for ` kes\u00e4 ' ( summer ) that we do n't anymore , that and the fact that you use german loan words , like telefo , that we have replaced with native words makes estonian give the impression that you are reading an older finnish text . 
  i know that in reality it is finnish that uses more old words . 
  i 've also heard that because of this it is easier for estonians to understand finnish than finns to understand estonian . 
  i usually get a broad idea what is said or written . 
  estonian seems as if it is an odd mixture of old finnish , german and totally unrecognisable words . 
  the unfamiliar words usually are native estonian words , like [ ` ait\u00e4h ' ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/ait%c3%a4h ) , which in finnish is ` kiitos ' . 
  also there are words that you recognise but have a somewhat different meaning in finnish , like the word for milk in estonian means sour milk in finnish . 
  but are n't some norwegian dialects a bit hard to understand even for norwegians ? 
  could that be reason why they would speak english ? 
  i was visiting haaparanta in sweden , or haparanda as it is known in swedish , last summer and at least there almost all people working in shops spoke finnish . 
  i only remember one lady who did n't speak finnish but clearly understood it . 
  i do n't know witch one is the best as i do n't hike , but there is a site for finnish national parks where you can get more information : http://www.nationalparks.fi/en/welcome . . 
  i would imagine they are . 
  it was just an example to what lengths some of you americans can go . 
   after voting the first time last year , i was pestered by my father about who i voted for but that 's a breach of the secrecy of the ballot . 
  my parents have never demanded to know who i voted for , and if they did , they would get a very stern lecture about secret ballot . 
  one thing that i find utterly baffling about american culture is the idea that you have to guard your daughters virginity .

   women do their service to society by having children ( men doing theirs by serving ) it does n't work like that , conscription is mandatory ( if enforced ) , having children is n't . 
  why does a conscript army equal crappy hardware ? 
  you cut out the word `` former '' from what i said . 
  do n't try to twist my words . 
  of course serving conscripts do n't get sent overseas but once the service is over you can apply for peace keeping operations . 
  at least former finnish conscripts have been successful in peace keeping operations . 
  and finnish conscripts recently passed some nato test with flying colors . 
  interesting , i imagine the situation would have to be pretty drastic to call in the reserve . 
  wo n't do much good if they 're still not stopped at the border . 
  by the way , would n't they need to use the reserve to monitor the border if it would come to that ? 
  i doubt there are enough military police conscripts currently serving to monitor anything apart the designated border crossing sites . 
  i 'm a military police by training , maybe i should start to expect a letter from the army !, 
  ^ just ^ joking ^ ^ or ^ ^ am ^ ^ i, 
  i agree , i 'm a bit confused why finland lets refugees in from russia . 
  i wonder why the refugees get to cross the border without a visa , i would need a visa if i were going to russia ( unless i took a short cruise to st. petersburg , it is an exception ) . 
  once the swedish border stopped leaking russia opened the valve . 
  seems that they 're trying to destabilize finland . 
  i did n't even think about that , thanks for showing that point of view for me . 
  in reality that is not a problem in finland so such consern has n't even crossed my mind but now i can see why foreigners might be worried . 
  the news have said that the property is supposed to house russia 's little green men if they want to pull off something similar that happened in ukraine . 
  this is not about an ` actual invasion ' but a more modern way of war . 
  according to older news pieces , they have also been buying property near finnish military areas etc. 
  for monitoring purposes . 
  but this has been going on for years . 
  i do n't understand what this has to do with gestapo , stasi and dictatorships . 
  your german tax office for sure knows how much you make even if they do n't publish the knowledge like ours does .

  it 's okay , me neither :d haha , true !, 
  but i do n't think it would change my opinion . 
  what you said sounded like the majority is against public tax records but the government forces this upon us . 
  i think you have the burden of proof when you made that claim . 
  but i know there is probably no proof either way , i just wanted to challenge what you said . 
  about the envy , i do n't think the open tax records are causing it . 
  well off people have nice houses and better cars , you do n't need tax records to see if your neighbour is richer than you . 
  i 've never looked up people in tax records but i 'm not blind , i know who in my social circle makes money and who does n't . 
  but frankly , i do n't care who makes how much . 
  as a finn i 'm okay with this . 
  it adds transparency and makes tax evasion a bit harder . 
  it 's not like everyone checks what everyone else gets paid , each year you see these top earner lists and that 's it . 
  most people wo n't spy their neighbours etc as that would require a visit to the tax office . 
  and even if they do , i do n't really care as it 's not that big of a secret to me . 
  my friends/neighbours/colleagues already know what my job is and how i live so they can pretty accurately guess what i earn . 
  what do you base this on ? 
  i 've not heard about the popular opinion being against this , most people seem to be fine with the current practice . 
  if you mean a couple of pissed off people interviewed in a news paper , that does n't mean anything .

  what ? 
  the article had nothing to do with russia or fear mongering . 
  if finnish engineers are overpriced then everybody else here is also overpriced . 
  if a plumber or a construction worker makes more than an engineer who spent 5-7 years to get his/her education , i think it is a problem . 
  finnish prices require good wages . 
  edit : you 're right that skills required at nokia/ms might not be valuable here anymore . 
  many of them are hardware experts that no longer have anywhere to go after nokia and ms stopped hiring . 
  well , comparatively next to nothing . 
  you can see them hiring master 's level people for engineering jobs and offering around 2500 $ / month before taxes . 
  after a single person household rent and taxes you end up with about 1200-1400 $ / month . 
  in finland that is a very low salary for the level of the job . 
  average salary in finland is 3500 $ / mo and median is 3100 $ / mo. 
  that 's what they 're always saying . 
  from my point of view there is a raging shortage of experienced developers that are ready to work for next to nothing . 
  entry level jobs are really hard to find , they want experience for cheap . 
  actually 400 people moved from finland to estonia last year . 
  details are unknown but probably one motivation is work . 
  as a personal anecdote , i know one person who moved to estonia to work as a developer . 
  not much people are leaving finland even though the economy is bad . 
  two days ago it was on the news that last year 10 000 finns left the country which is apparently a pretty low number . 
  we still have lots of ex nokia and microsoft engineers unemployed from previous lay offs . 
  last month nokia once again announced laying people off , this time 1300 . 
  too many lay offs to realistically employ all of them to other companies . 
  microsoft just announced that it shuts down mobile development in finland and 1350 people will get laid off . 
  pretty bad news in an already bad situation . 
  brittle ?

  paying taxes could be regarded as slavery then . 
  like taxes are used to suport students : `` slavery for the benefit of students . '', 
  entrepreneurship does not mean becoming very rich with your own company . 
  it means developing and creating new business on your own . 
  many professionals in entrepreneurs do n't profit from the company becoming super big and profitable . 
  they profit from starting up new interesting businesses with new ideas , and then sell them for profit , for example for google or facebook . 
  then they go on to try and set up another business . 
  that 's entrepreneurship too , and is independent from taxes for rich people . 
  being a haven for entrepreneurship means haven for developing , starting and running new businesses . 
  finland for example does n't tax monetary or share wealth . 
  so someone with 70 billion on bank account or equivalent worth in company shares is taxed from that wealth as much as someone with 5 dollars on bank account or equivalent worth of company shares : zero . 
  i think it was so that the wealth of ikea is on some dutch non-profit organization with lower taxes , nominally working to advance interior and furniture design , and the founder of ikea happens to be the president of that non-profit and gets paid substantially for his position , but the actual wealth nominally is not his personal possession . 
   because their welfare system is broken so no real incentive to become very rich . . yeah , i 'm sure there 's no incentive work if you can have a billion euro wealth . 
  that 's just * a million euros for each month for 70 years * . 
  that 's just not enough !, 
  it does not motivate anyone !, 
  its not * very * rich !, 
  i feel there 's some miscommunication happening here . 
  let 's try another approach . 
  do you think hateful speech , hate crimes and other outright racist and intolerant behavior towards muslims , including those who have long lived or even been born in europe , will significantly increase or risk increasing due to the immigration crisis ? 
  if you do believe the behavior from point 1 will increase or risks increasing significantly , do you accept said behavior ? 
  if you do not accept the behavior from point 1 , do you want people to voice their concern of said behavior ? 
  if you do not accept the behavior from point 1 , and want people to voice their concern of it , can people refer to said behavior as bigotry ? 
  bonus question : do you think it is possible for person to be worried about the huge influx of immigrants , their effect on society * and at the same time * be worried about hateful speech , hate crimes and other outright racist and intolerant behavior targeted towards immigrants and muslims in general ? 
  oh , that makes it okay then !, 
  there was n't anything ridiculous or racist about it . 
  attacks on gays in europe are mostly by white men . 
  it 's understandable , because the overwhelming majority of europeans are white . 
  these same white men who attack gays tend to be the ones who are the loudest on the backwardness of foreigners . 
  even if the person above agreed on far right on immigration issues , he would never trust them , as they are the ones mostly attacking gays . 
  in [ another comment ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/477c2z/across_europe_gay_migrants_face_abuse_in_asylum/d0azxi3 ) i outlined an example from finland where anti-immigrants in an anti-immigration forum were blaming muslims for a tear gas attack in helsinki pride , and when it was revealed the perpetrators were far right , the forum largely started attacking lgbt minorities , disparaging us , questioning our rights , downplaying the tear gas attack and so on . 
  as another example , helsinki had a `` hetero pride '' for celebration of traditional relationships and in opposition of same sex marriage . 
  [ here 's a photo of some of the participants ] ( http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-9z3cbidheni/uj_qyzutfzi/aaaaaaaaapw/sfnvg3nkgf8/s1600/hetero+pride+hki+j%c3%a4ljilt%c3%a4+heilausta+pilke+silm%c3%a4kulmassa+21.9.2013+seppo+lehto+pic27.jpg ) . 
  do you really think it 's ridiculous and racist to say that the same white far right people who are violent against gays are also the ones most loudly speaking about how foreigners are backward ? 
  do you really think that for someone who thinks equal treatment of lgbt is important , it is wise to trust the far right , when the far right is the common perpetrator of homophobic violence ? 
   politicians and the majority of people do n't care about lgbt , they 'll be the first ones to be thrown under the bus if mentality changes and become less tolerant . 
  my guess is that when mentality changes and becomes less tolerant in europe , muslims will be the first ones to be thrown under the bus . 
  [ also in america ] ( https://youtu.be/1hlceiuatzg?t=5m20s ) . 
  take into consideration that the opinion `` i 'm against homosexuality '' for the most people thinking like that is n't in any way affecting their lives . 
  homosexuality just is not relevant to their life in any way , they do n't really have to think about the issue , it does n't really manifest into some activity . 
  for many gay people who grow up with parents who are homophobic it 's not like their parents are horrible assholes . 
  they just have one stupid bigoted attitude , and for many of these parents , these attitudes and opinion change when their kids come out . 
  i think it 's unreasonable to say these people change from `` horrible homophobic assholes '' into `` good people '' because they change their opinion when they have to face issue personally . 
  i think it is more reasonable to accept that good people can have bad opinions . 
  there are no perfect people , so we have to accept even the good people have flaws , and not in the `` oh his farts smell really bad '' way , but as in people who otherwise behave respectfully and are really polite , fair and caring can have one limited sector where their normal dominant qualities are n't apparent . 
   the problem is : among the finnish people , there is a small minority who would act that aggressive against gay people ; among immigrants , the `` minority '' who would act aggressive against gay people would be much greater . 
  i 'm not denying that problem . 
  i wrote the comment above because while immigrant muslims do n't read out these comments , europeans worrying about immigration do read these comments , and i want them know that this kind of issue also exist . 
  i want them to recognize that bigoted people will use the experiences of lgbt people as an excuse for bigotry , and try to hide their bigotry behind crocodile tears . 
  it reminds me of people who were bigoted against lgbt people in regard of same sex adoption rights , and said as their opposition is based on to protect the rights of children , that as they are worried about the rights of children , it 's not bigotry and they are not bigoted . 
  but at the same time many of these people said television shows should not have lgbt people , children should n't be taught about lgbt issues in sex education and so on , i.e. 
  they used any opportunity to oppose that lgbt teens and children would receive information about them . 
  so their care for `` rights of children '' was just a mask for bigotry against lgbt people , as lgbt children did not have rights to information concerning them . 
  what i 'm saying that people will try to smuggle bigotry and intolerance to be accepted in fake shrouds of noble causes and genuine problems , and the shrouds may make people accept intolerance and bigotry without them realizing . 
  the fact is , that bigotry and intolerance towards muslims is also on the rise , and people will try to make that bigotry and intolerance seem acceptable by sugaring it with seemingly noble motivations . 
  a hyperbole : * `` muslim people on average are significantly more homophobic than europeans . 
  in many muslim countries , gay people are murdered because of their sexuality . 
  if the amount of muslims in europe significantly increase , muslim hate crimes toward lgbt people will significantly increase . 
  we must protect lgbt people from hate crimes . 
  muslims should not have the right to seek asylum from eu and must be deported to their home countries . 
  * '' here , facts and and easily agreeable probabilities and suggestions are topped in the last sentence with a suggestion of institutionalized bigotry targeting people of certain religion . 
  it is much easier to agree to bigoted suggestion and opinions , when they are first framed with good golden intentions . 
  the principle is similar to leading polls . 
  think about a poll * `` finland has one of the largest public sectors among countries . 
  many economist see large public spending as a contributor to economic recessions . 
  greece is economically ruined because of escalated public spending . 
  do you agree with the suggestion that finland should make significant cuts to its public sector ? 
  '' * lgbt people have been targets of bigotry for ages . 
  the fact that muslims on average are much more bigoted than europeans does not justify bigotry against muslims . 
  just as lgbt people should n't be targets of bigotry , neither should muslims be targets of bigotry . 
  in the lgbt discussion i 've seen people accept bigotry towards lgbt people without them even realizing what they were doing , when basically some people said `` think of the children ! '', 
  i 've seen seemingly good causes used to rally people into bigotry , and these people believing it 's not bigotry but a necessary measure . 
  as someone who has been target of personal , institutionalized and violent bigotry , i do not want that kind of bigotry towards muslims justified in the name of my rights . 
  and in the end , i underline that i do n't have an answer or a clear suggestion how to solve the refugee issue . 
  i 'm not saying that decisions to take less asylum seekers is bigotry . 
  i 'm not saying strict border control is bigotry . 
  i 'm not saying the view `` more muslims in europe will increase problems in europe '' is bigotry . 
  the issue is very complicated , and imo many people resort to bigotry because it feels the easiest answer . 
  edit : typos . 
   you ca n't just wish intolerance away by ignoring it , you have to fight against it . 
  you can fight intolerance away without being intolerant yourself . 
  lgbt movement has * for decades * fought against intolerance , but they have n't done it by being intolerant towards straight people . 
   same thing with racism , i do n't think it 'd be reasonable to let millions of racist people come over here . 
  do you think it is reasonable & right thing to do to judge & treat every single one of these people as a racists due to their ethnicity/religion ? 
   ( 2 ) in the exercise of his rights and freedoms , everyone shall be subject only to such limitations as are determined by law solely for the purpose of securing due recognition and respect for the rights and freedoms of others and of meeting the just requirements of morality , public order and the general welfare in a democratic society . 
  that does not really say human rights are conditional and that a society may place limits on human rights as long as they meet the criteria of being `` just requirements of morality , public order and the general welfare '' in a democratic society . 
  it only says about * people * being `` subject to limitations '' , not * human rights * being subject to limitations . 
  for example setting speed limits for driving is a limitation for people , but it 's not a limitation of human right . 
  the very following article 30 says this : ** `` nothing in this declaration may be interpreted as implying for any state , group or person any right to engage in any activity or to perform any act aimed at the destruction of any of the rights and freedoms set forth herein . 
  '' ** for example you can not use section 2 of article 29 to limit the freedom to live and say '' * human rights are conditional and we did n't break human rights . 
  we were only killing those people we hate because we were securing due recognition and respect for the rights and freedoms of others and of meeting the just requirements of morality , public order and the general welfare in our democratic people 's republic of korea * '' . 
  also the very third part of article 29 says this :  ( 3 ) these rights and freedoms may in no case be exercised contrary to the purposes and principles of the united nations . 
  this also means that you shoud n't collectively deny human rights from some ethnicity or religion on the basis of `` protecting human rights '' . 
  you can not collectively punish all muslims for the actions of some muslims . 
  you can not refuse asylum from some ethnicity on the basis on what some other of that ethnicity has done . 
  oh come on . 
  i have an impression what might be meant with `` importing political islam '' , but that impression is colored mainly by partisan online discussions , and i have n't that actively been following the immigration discussions in english , ( nor in my native finnish ) . 
  and seeing the term usually has a very different meaning , `` finland imports coffee '' and such , when it was used in the context here , i did not have a clear impression of what the question was . 
  just vague assumptions . 
  i 'd rather ask clarifications than make assumptions what the other meant , because wrong assumptions about the stances and meanings of others are the main reason people kill themselves over online discussions .

  by a lot . 
  by every metric , she lost .

  i 've never encountered one nor heard of one failing ( though i guess it still happens * sometimes * ) . 
  headphone plugs etc break relatively often , but not ac power plugs . 
  actually , if you order items sold by amazon eu , amazon will charge your local vat ( which also means the order total will be slightly more/less depending on your location ) . 
  of course , amazon will still keep the profits so money still goes out . 
  i do n't think logistics are an issue , as amazon already fulfills all european orders by shipping them from any of their european warehouses . 
  for example , regardless of whether i order from . co.uk , . de , . fr , . it or . es , almost everything sold by amazon gets shipped to me from uk by royal mail ( small items ) or from germany by dhl ( larger items ) anyway . 
  if i use express shipping , they usually ship from uk by ups regardless of which amazon site i made the order on . 
  note , though , that ordering from amazon.com you will prepay all the vat and customs fees at checkout if you select an amazonglobal shipping method ( which are actually the only shipping methods available to most european countries for non-media products ) . 
  the carrier will then handle all the import stuff in eu and either get the item directly to you or send it to you as a regular eu-internal postal parcel . 
   books do ship , but e.g. 
  clothing does not . 
  i 've ordered various clothing products many times from amazon.com , they ship them just fine to europe . 
  many 3rd-party sellers do n't ship internationally , though , so i tend to look at mostly amazon-sold products . 
  if you meant * subtitling * of live speech , that is indeed not done here , but no dubbing either . 
  having live foreign speech in news is very rare , but the host would just explain what was said afterwards . 
   ( postal code hoh oho ) his postal code in finland is * [ 99999 ] ( http://www.verkkoposti.com/e3/english/postalcodecatalog?streetname=&amp;postcodeorcommune=99999 ) * . 
  the price for 1gbps here is usually 50-100 eur/mo , when available . 
  i pay 50 eur/mo for 250/100 mbps . 
  with the current 1 mbps universal service subscriptions the law mandates minimum 750 kbps average over 24 hours and minimum 500 kbps average over 4 hours . 
  i 'd guess something similar would be put into place with 100m , but i think that is n't happening in the very near future , anyway . 
  - dna [ universal broadband subscription ] ( https://www.dna.fi/dna-yleispalvelulaajakaista ) price is not mentioned , but is mobile and without data cap ( 1 mbps ) . 
  - elisa universal broadband subscription is [ 37,90 eur/mo ] ( http://elisa.fi/attachment/content/yleispalveluliittym__internet_hinnasto_20130613_fi.pdf ) ( note : 3 years old data ) ( no data cap , mobile or adsl , 1 mbps ) , starting fee 129 eur , starting fee if adsl repeater needed 429 eur , plus customer specific network building fee . 
  network building fee has to be reasonable as well . 
  the provider may request state subsidy for larger network building costs . 
  note that you would only order one of these if you live somewhere that has no 3g mobile phone coverage at all as the universal service subscriptions are much costlier than regular services ( but still pretty fair , compared to not having internet at all ) . 
  as can be seen in e.g. 
  [ elisa 's coverage map ] ( http://elisa.fi/kuuluvuus/ ) there are n't too many places like that . 
  for comparison , regular [ elisa mobile broadband ] ( https://kauppa.saunalahti.fi/#!/nettiliittymat/mobiililaajakaista ) is ( all with no data caps ) : * 21 mbps 14,90 eur/mo , * 50 mbps 21,90 eur/mo , * 100 mbps 29,80 eur/mo , * 300 mbps 49,90 eur/mo . 
  relevant gallery of the larger shelters used for sports : http://imgur.com/a/qkxon apartment building shelters are of course smaller . 
  english version of that same page : http://en.ilmatieteenlaitos.fi/wave-height, 
  sonera 's [ coverage map ] ( https://www.sonera.fi/asiakastuki/ohjeet/peittoaluekartta?id=1398 ) says 50mbps 4g for the address of [ siperia lapponica ] ( http://www.siperia.eu/ ) ( currently down , over bandwidth limit ) , their sleg dog safari business . 
  you mean municipalities ( * kunta * ) , not counties ( * maakunta , kreivikunta , piirikunta * ) . 
   you could say they 're impeding the free market , but at the same time i can see how it would be unfair to go to some random carrier in , say , estonia with the best offer and then go off and use a durch carrier 's ( probably much more expensive to maintain ) network . 
  the estonian carrier still has to pay to the dutch carrier at the regulated wholesale roaming prices . 
  so these provisions protect the estonian carrier , not the dutch one . 
  a delegation of the parliament of finland visited north korea in april 1975 , which is from where this ( real ) photo is . 
  kekkonen was n't personally there , as far as i know , though . 
  the original poster is a researcher of the archives of the organizations of the national coalition party , so presumably he just dug it up from the archives . 
  edit : and [ kekkonen ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/urho_kekkonen ) is quite a legendary president who served 26 years - jokingly sometimes referred to as a dictator of sorts . 
  the president had much more power back then . 
  during summers it was regularly over 90 \u00b0 f in my small apartment in finland so i bought a/c a couple of years back . 
  outdoors was not quite as hot , though . 
  i think the post was specifically about `` cities '' , i.e. 
  places that are actually called cities , not just being the equivalent of one . 
  so it would rule out all swedish municipalities  ( per [ wikipedia ] ( https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/stad_ ( sverige \\ ) ) `` sverige har s\u00e5ledes inga st\u00e4der i kommunalr\u00e4ttslig mening '' ) . 
  if city-equivalents like municipalities would be counted , there would be larger ones in finland , too ( inari is 17 333,65 km \u00b2 ) . 
  there is no legal difference between a municipality and a city in finland , either , but any municipality can call themselves a city ( and have a city council instead of municipality council , etc ) . 
  yes , though it is not something one would actually use and is very hard to decode even for finns because of the amount of inflections ( ? ), 
  it has . 
  ep\u00e4j\u00e4rjestelm\u00e4llistytt\u00e4m\u00e4tt\u00f6myydell\u00e4\u00e4ns\u00e4k\u00e4\u00e4nk\u00f6h\u00e4n = maybe not even with their state of not having been arranged to have desystematized ? 
  edit : the grandparent commenter updated their word to a longer one based on `` systematize '' ( j\u00e4rjestelm\u00e4llist\u00e4\u00e4 ) instead of `` organize '' ( j\u00e4rjest\u00e4\u00e4 ) , so i 've updated the above breakdown to match . 
   also , i saw one word beginning with ` yht ' or something like that , which , really , really impressed and confused me . 
  y in finnish is ipa [ y ] , i.e. 
  the same as the vowel sound in the end of the english word `` few '' . 
  i guess this makes it make more sense ? 
  there has been no change . 
  we too use local bank systems similar to ideal for online purchases at local websites . 
  not as standardized , though - every bank has their own system , and then there are services that bundle them together like ideal does ( so the retailer does not need to support all banks by themselves ) . 
  however , finnish debit cards are all mastercard debit , visa debit , or visa electron cards , which are all accepted by all amazon sites ( and other international websites that accept visa/mastercard ) so there is no big issue here and no credit cards are needed . 
  i guess netherlands has their own local debit card system instead ? 
  there are 4 multilingual amazon sites : - amazon canada has english and french . 
  - amazon china has chinese and english . 
  - amazon germany has dutch , english , german , polish , and turkish . 
  - amazon japan has chinese , english , and japanese . 
  other amazon sites only support a single language . 
  they seem to be slowly moving in that direction with [ amazon.de ] ( https://www.amazon.de/ ) . 
  in the last couple of years they 've added dutch , english , polish , and turkish language options and added quite a few countries to their [ free standard delivery program ] ( https://www.amazon.de/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeid=201910160 ) ( currently austria , belgium , czech republic , denmark , finland , germany , hungary , liechtenstein , luxembourg , netherlands , poland , slovakia , sweden , switzerland , turkey ) . 
  note that this map is a bit over 16 years old . 
  those indeed look more like uncontrolled airfields than `` proper '' airports , finland also has over 50 of those ( with icao codes , most without iata codes ) in addition to the 25 regular airports . 
   21 civilian airports well , actually 25 airports with civilian flights as 4 are combined military + civilian airports ( and 2 of those combo airports , tampere and rovaniemi , are in top 4 in finnish civilian passenger air traffic , so i 'd say they should count ) . 
   which makes sense , since using a credit card is accompanied by a 2-5 % fee . 
  i guess they may vary by country , but at least in finland the fees are way lower than that , and for debit cards ( which most people use ) even lower . 
  not the case for finland at least , having a beer or two is socially acceptable here if you are under the limit . 
  relevant username : * tissit * = * tits * in finnish . 
  district cooling is a thing in finland at least . 
  the first network started in 1998 and the cooling networks have been expanding since then . 
  finnish pm also flies his trips regularly , smaller jets than 737 though . 
  there was no country code in finnish plates before 2001 . 
  sf was usually in an oval sticker ( [ example ] ( http://www.urhoklubi.net/tumpolan_kunta/autotalo/autot/talbot_solara/talbot_2.jpg ) ) when a country code was required .

  yes , roaming got a lot cheaper ( ~ 90 % cheaper than the previous limit , even with these authorized surcharges ) . 
  note that retail roaming charges are not completely abolished . 
  there are some exceptions , the last one of which is rarely mentioned ( not mentioned in op link either ) : - if you are permanently roaming or primarily roaming , charges may be applied . 
  - unlimited data over ( plan_price / 7.70 $ / gb * 2 ) per month may be charged roaming fees . 
  - in specific and exceptional circumstances , with a view to ensuring the sustainability of its domestic charging model , where a roaming provider is not able to recover its overall actual and projected costs of providing regulated roaming services in accordance with articles 6a and 6b , from its overall actual and projected revenues from the provision of such services , that roaming provider may apply for authorisation to apply a surcharge . 
  ( 531/2012 article 6c , as amended by 2015/2120 ) all three big operators in finland have applied for such an authorization . 
  we 'll know whether they get them later today . 
  dna and elisa are currently listing roaming prices that assume the authorizations are granted . 
  edit 2 : authorizations were granted to elisa , telia , dna , moi : [ four operators authorised to apply roaming surcharges ] ( https://www.viestintavirasto.fi/en/ficora/news/2017/fouroperatorsauthorisedtoapplyroamingsurcharges.html ) edit : finnish regulatory authority 's relevant details page ( english version ) : [ roam for less in the eu from 15 june 2017 - you only pay the domestic price or a small surcharge ] ( https://www.viestintavirasto.fi/en/internettelephone/usingamobilephoneabroad/eupricecap.html ) they also say `` this exception aims to ensure that there will be large low-cost packages with unlimited data available in finland in the future , as well .

  peacekeeping is observation . 
  only a retard expect light infantry to duke with numerously superior tank brigade . 
  if the mission is `` peace enforcement '' , then the soldiers ** demand ** completely different set of equipment . 
  and only cowards there were the 6000 bosniaks under ramiz becirovic . 
  that is a full brigade , when dutchbat had 450 people ( = half battalion ) . 
  this whole discussion is bosniak army covering for their own cowardly flight out of the pocket . 
  interesting ruling . 
  anyone know which court it is and whether it is the supreme court ? 
  if goverments are liable for un failings , then the peacekeeping moves into panzer brigades with helicopters instead of lightly armed reservists . 
  nato price for eastern europe is around one billion per year for one brigade . 
  massive impact potential to peacekeeping with this ruling . 
  as a finnish person i d be more interested in whether russia lasts . 
  the gdp has tanked couple years in the row , the visiting russians are very poor again and st.pete prostitute prices might have halved . 
  if russia breaks up , a lot of them will head to finland ... 
  good luck with the eternal sanctions though ... eu 's russian border will never accept the invasion . 
  got to protect the tax haven somehow . 
  it is a self defense weapon in britain . 
  the student lunch is like 2.5 e in the universities . 
  outside on the market it is between 9-12e for lunch buffet . 
  you did understand it is a reader poll , right ? 
  `` more technocracy , less politics '' got 3rd worst support ( 5 % ) , just above `` get turkey into eu '' . 
  btw here is something for you to think about . 
  finland bought 22 of these and nobody ( outside the generals ) has an idea why we are buying those . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mgm-140_atacms here is the range on map : https://www.google.fi/maps/@57.9151608,27.6234858,6.22z?hl=en, 
   so is estonia 's help not good enough for you , or what ? 
  more practical . 
  how are you shipping it over the gulf full of mines and russian antiship missiles ? 
  \u00c5land will get invaded straight from the start too . 
  there will be anti air battery in \u00c5land with 150km-200km range class . 
  quit thinking politics and start thinking how the actual soldier moves from france to estonia/finland . 
   i really do n't see what would be wrong with helping south korea ? 
  this is the key . 
  i really do n't see what is right in traveling all the way to korea to invade some random hill and losing 50 % of my men in one attack . 
  what the fuck ? 
  why should i go to die in some mad idiots war ? 
   putin is the one we 're seeking protection against in the first place . 
  estonia is . 
  we are fine in finland and especially fine when trump/erdogan are leaders in nato . 
   nato members are your allies who will come to your help . 
  look at the map . 
  how are you bringing help to finland if nato ca n't even get the help to estonia ? 
  serious question . 
  finland is an island for europe and the 1st russian move will be rushing for oulu .

  yes . 
  every single nato conflict from here on out . 
  if turkey fights russia , you ll be there . 
  in turkey . 
  you might even get pulled into `` non nato '' conflicts , like s.korea versus n.korea . 
   estonia has conscription too look . 
  there is a 10-fold power difference between finland and estonia . 
  finland trains 21k into reserve each year . 
  the active reserve is 280k . 
  200 mbts , 200 ifvs , 1600 artillery pieces , some 8000-12000 antitank missiles and another maybe 70000 antitank rocket ( law ) russian maneuver army can field some 180k troops with maybe 300-700 main battle tanks . 
  simple war , finland is in st.peter under a month . 
   based on some irrational fears 1 . 
  you are infantry 2 . 
  the leaders deciding about wars in 2017 : trump , putin , erdogan 3 . 
  ** you ** get sent to turkey because putin wants to fuck some gymnast and start invading countries . 
  or because trump is moron . 
  or because erdogan wants to be the sultan of ottomans . 
  you do n't ** really ** understand how conscription works ? 
   you can be in nato and also have independent defence capability . 
  this is not possible with professional engineers , it wizards , bricklayers , truck drivers and mcdonald 's sales men . 
  the defense is ** me ** . 
  i m an assault infantry squad lead and an engineer . 
  my best friend is an artillery battery commander and also an engineer . 
  my brother is in med school , but in army he is a helicopter mechanic . 
  my other brother is an aa-missile infantry , genius and develops algorithms for energy companies . 
  if russia attacks here , we will just collect gear from the army and get to front . 
  life is over anyway at that point if russia is trying to take over . 
  the options : a ) let russia take over -  sucks b ) pick up gun and stop them -  possibly die , but ** it does n't matter since the option is russians taking over . 
  ** this is how peasant armies work . 
  nato brings nothing in this mix , except pulls us into every single conflict with russians . 
  and by us , i mean ** me ** , personally . 
  i am reading this your comment chain in this thread and i d think you are wildly off base here . 
  a lot of finns do n't want to see their kids fighting in some mudhut wars . 
  this is huge . 
  i do n't want to see my godsons or brothers in libya/iraq/afganistan or any other `` liberation '' effort . 
  also the trust is an issue . 
  finland is even more peninsula than the baltics , making defense even more difficult . 
  it faster for russians to run over the country than ship help from europe . 
  so since trust in incoming help is low ( hello 1939 ) , everybody 's kids get send to sand countries for oil wars and because it makes almost no sense to capture the svamp called finland at expense of 500k dead troops ... -  makes little sense for finland to join nato . 
  until the next * soccer * game . 
  chinese free trade means free exports but massive import barriers . 
  ** anything ** they import gets taxed to hell or just outright banned . 
  beware of the chinese bearing gifts . 
   jassm is way more capable yea not , and especially at ** 3-5 times the price what us army pays for them . 
  ** nato arms deals with us reminds soviet arms deals of old . 
  20-30 years old garbage with triple price . 
  patriot deal = scam jassm deal = triple price , so just hard core gouging . 
  edit : and read this cruise missile analysis by the finnish defense academy from 2014 . 
  relatively impartial https://www.doria.fi/bitstream/handle/10024/98691/sk1707_nisonen_slo.pdf?sequence=2, 
  so us outsources the dev to israelis , since their own projects are regular disasters . 
  in david 's sling example the us company is the subcontractor for us units ... whoopee , such an honor . 
  iron dome is bought tech from israel . 
  israel out did us air missiles in 9 years with iron beam , iron dome , david 's sling ... 
  currently ** only ** competitive aa missile us has is sm6 . 
  please , do grab a donut on your way out . 
   far more expensive .

  here we go again , haha i already gave up on you since it was too much :d oh , isn \u00b4 t it my favorite little `` timo soini is on the right economically because i read a line in a _ wikipedia article _ ( where in that same line he mentioned them being a worker \u00b4 s party . 
  have you googled that yet ? 
  exciting to learn new things , isn \u00b4 t it ? ) '', 
  american . 
  or was it that the whole party was on the right economically ? 
  please refresh my memory , it was lovely how you `` educated '' me . 
   you mean like the list i provided of your right wing party which had all of those as their core values . 
  oh really ? 
  let \u00b4 s see sweety . 
  - banning abortion . 
  yes the thing is honey , that since we are not retarded as a nation , there isn \u00b4 t a single party in the finnish parliament that would like to ban or tries to band abortion . 
  suggesting to ban abortion would be a political suicide , you would be ripped apart . 
  even the most religious people ( and there are so few ) would never dreaming suggesting that , despite their personal views . 
  - crazy gun laws no . 
  since again , we are not retarded . 
  not even true finns . 
  - the obsession with religion true finns have christian values , or christian-socialistic as many of them describe . 
  however , the craziness with jesus don \u00b4 t come even near of the laughable circus you have over there . 
  since we , even true finns , don \u00b4 t have the urge to share how we think about god , people simply don \u00b4 t know what you believe in . 
  lutheran values are seen as a part of the finnish culture to some extent , it doesn \u00b4 t matter that pretty much no one is religious . 
  you on the other hand , how many publicly atheist congress member you have ? 
  - `` traditional family '' here you got it right , well done sweety , they do oppose gay marriage , gay couples adopting etc. 
  however , the difference to your republicans is that true finns would never want to remove paid maternity leave or any kind of maternity benefits that make finland the best country to be a mother ( you guys score horribly in that area too , you can send a thank you note to your republican politics . 
   ) that means they protect single mothers too . 
  you remembered two parts , really well done !, 
  of course in your head that transfers to `` all of those '' , just like `` every right wing party in europe '' . 
  you sure know love to generalize when there is no base for it . 
   don \u00b4 t be too hard on yourself . 
   ignorant as fuck . 
  as i said , after you i am not surprised anymore why donald trump is so popular . 
  i guess it is some kind of culture shock , and makes you appreciate what you have . 
  if you are still interested on how `` right '' the true finns are , please read this https://www.perussuomalaiset.fi/news/perussuomalaiset-tekevat-isanmaallista-talouspolitiikkaa/ and tell how communist you would rate them on the scale of 1 to 10 . 
  oh right sorry , you didn \u00b4 t speak finnish . 
  or any other language than english . 
  i just tought you could use something else than wikipedia . 
   depends what you mean by right wing . 
  economically only ? 
  what i mean by right wing ? 
  i mean what people in general mean by right wing . 
  you know well that republicans are on the right . 
  considering what unites or gives the frame , basically defines the republican party ( and , well , in general any political parties ) are the economical views , yes , of course i mean economically . 
   nationalists ? 
  definitely yes . 
  could you please name those parties and how they are definitely more nationalist than the republicans ( please give concrete examples ) ? 
  also , i naturally meant the conservative values that are tied to right-wing parties too . 
  meaning wanting to ban abortion , crazy gun laws , the ridiculous insanity with the christian religion you guys have , `` traditional family '' and all the bullshit this is considered to mean etc. 
  ideally these examples you are going to provide would match all of these , like republicans . 
  we already have had an american telling how for example swedish democrats , true finns , `` everyone in hungary '' and ukip `` make republicans look like hippies '' , so please save your country \u00b4 s name and provide some real information . 
  educating children who are young enough to be breastfeed . 
  meaning babies very roughly aged 6-18 months . 
  you americans have exceptionally smart babies apparently . 
  also the this was said : `` except for maternity leave '' . 
  we are talking here about children who are older than the one \u00b4 s who still drink from boobies . 
  and even if we would , milk can be bottled and/or use formula . 
  hey i really need to ask , are you voting for donald trump ? 
  i will never have an answer to my last question on where republicans lean on economical issues since that would mean would have to admit how perfectly wrong you are , but please can you answer this ? 
  are you a republican ? 
  what is your education ? 
  do you support obamacare ? 
  i would be more than glad to put here articles where timo soini comments about his left-wing policies on economic matters if you want to continue `` discussing '' this . 
  somehow it just hurts me there are people who think one line in wikipedia covers the knowledge they need ( funniest part is that there is clearly said they are a _ worker \u00b4 s party _ . 
  do you even know what that means ?? ), 
  and i am happy to help you with that matter . 
   it 's right there . 
  you 're either a troll or beyond all hope . 
  i don \u00b4 t think i have ever seen anything this ironic . 
  but i don \u00b4 t blame you , it is not your fault . 
  but somehow i just want to know are you unique or is this a common problem . 
   it 's right there . 
  you 're either a troll or beyond all hope . 
  timo soini is clearly left-wing on economic politics he would disagree with you . 
  god help me . 
  you are the living example of why people in your country vote for donald trump . 
  i am almost in tears here . 
  timo soini is clearly on the left on . 
  economic . 
  policies . 
  why is this so challenging ?? 
  he is on the right on his conservative values . 
  i understand now why you tried telling me i don \u00b4 t understand the concept of right wing . 
  it is because you simply don \u00b4 t. 
  read the first sentence of your wikipedia article . 
  hey , since this is extremely challenging , i will ask this for the last time : ** does republicans lean on the left on economic policies ** ? 
  i just can \u00b4 t believe this . 
  i can \u00b4 t. 
  you truly are this stupid . 
  `` you \u00b4 ve just been educated '' ... 
  i just can \u00b4 t. 
   inside the party there is also a movement which can be considered clearly rightist , led by mep jussi halla-aho . 
  there you go sweetheart . 
  read that sentence over and over again , what name there is again ? 
  timo soini is _ clearly _ left-wing on economic politics . 
  i can link you hundreds of articles in finnish on this matter . 
  i have spent hours watchig him debate , read maybe thousands of articles considering his very left-wing views on economic issues , like the welfare state he feels extremely strongly . 
   yes considering the gop has members with many different ideas . 
  dude ... 
  i can \u00b4 t believe this . 
  and you think that true finns have two members , halla-aho and soini then ? 
  let me be clear with this since you just don \u00b4 t get it : does the republican party lean on the left on economic policies ? 
  edit : also , if the concept of republican party as a whole is too challenging ( because clearly it is ) , please be free to introduce me to one of those more-left-wing-and-less-conservative members of your party , and i \u00b4 ll have a look , alright ?

  which is in a direct opposition to your claim that it does not . 
  this entire thread , in case you have n't noticed , is about discussing the impact of current migrant crisis on lives on average people in europe . 
  you choose to pretend that topic instead was something all together different to push a dogma . 
  that would be because it 's moscow , which is by far the most expensive city in the entire country . 
  there 's a reason why it 's classified separately in most relevant economic reports from the rest of the country when it comes to costs of living . 
  you seem to forget that your costs are largely equivalent . 
  as a point of comparison , monthly rent in helsinki , finland is around 700-900eur per month . 
  gasoline is around 1,4 eur per litre , and reasonable eating habits are going to set you back a couple of hundred a month . 
  sure , you get paid more . 
  but your expenditures are going to go up at the same rate . 
  if he can : 1 . 
  fit in culturally . 
  fit in linguistically . 
  have actually needed skills . 
  have actually needed experience . 
  chance of having all four is almost non-existent if you have n't already had experience working in target country . 
  and it 's going to take a lot of hard work to get these if you do n't already have them , which will take time and effort . 
  with no guarantee of payout . 
  i 'm going to burn for this , but ... `` this is significant because it 's an ~ ~ italian ~ ~ portugese actually working ! '', 
  on a less humorous side , what exactly would you see him do otherwise ? 
  he likely has a family to feed and he did n't get elected . 
  in politics , you do n't earn a living by coming second in election for a single seat . 
  edit : apparently i suck at european geography in the monday mornings . 
  apples and tractors . 
  reconnaissance aircraft exist to fill the specific void that is left by satellite surveillance even today , that is on demand reconnaissance . 
  something that is effectively impossible by satellite because of their low orbit and laws of physics . 
  this has nothing to do with radar detection , or identification of small aerial targets . 
  you also do not have even the most basic understanding of what radar even is to make the comparison you make . 
  radar , just as the name suggets is a system that can send a signal at specific frequency and then look for the echo of the signal in case there is something out in the direction of the sent signal to reflect it . 
  ground based radars need significant size and power to operate . 
  this is not a `` speculation '' . 
  these installations are typically stationary , extremely large and easily visible both from space and in the specific frequency in which they operate , as to have the ability to scan their operating area , and beat laws of physics which dictate that strength of the beam weakens square of the distance they need to emit at extreme power . 
  smaller mobile systems such as russian s-xxx systems and us patriot systems have more mobile radars , which are stil easily traceable by their signal emitters . 
  their security is achieved through having multiple emitters spread around alongside many dummies , so that destruction of these easily traceable emitters does not cripple the entire system . 
  again , presence of these systems is easily established . 
  when steel curtain fell , us specialists reported that in terms of actual ground radar efficiency , russians were at least a decade ahead of the west if not more . 
  this was largely because of the strategic needs - us focused its detection efforts in the air ( awacs ) which allowed them to have an inferior radar for same results ( no distortions from horizon ) . 
  inferior radar because of size and power constraints - you obviously can not have a radar of comparable power and size mounted on an aircraft . 
  strategic ground installations got more attention in russia which had to defend the single largest state in the world from all directions , and as a result , just like russians were behind in awacs style large aerial radars , russians were ahead in stationary radars . 
  one last time . 
  there is a reason why all relevant states , including us do in fact send aircraft when russians buzz them even with huge and slow aircraft like tu-95 right near their borders where they do in fact have these huge strategic installations and where radar horizon is low because it 's an ocean . 
  that is because there is no realiable way to identify what it is you see on your radar screen otherwise . 
  you have to claim that turkey has a system that no one , including us and russia have to make the claims turkish officials did . 
  i listed established facts alongside with basis from which these facts are drawn . 
  facts , unlike opinions , are not a matter of personal preference , but a matter of establishing evidence for them . 
  for example , # 4 facts are easily traceable from looking at public housing rules , as well as comprehending that those that are released from holding centres are classified as `` homeless '' which automatically puts them in a highest possible category , well above most locals who only need an apartment for `` social reasons '' such as moving out to another city to enroll in a university , needing a new apartment as a part of family splitting up and many other similar reasons . 
  these people have an urgent need , and often their need helps economic situation ( i.e. 
  students getting education so they can enter workforce ) . 
  there will be local children suffering as a result of this because divorced parents will be forced to live together creating an explosive situation as apartment they should have gotten goes to immigrants , and they can not afford to pay a significant premium that is going up even further because of migrant crisis in the private sector . 
  these are not `` opinions '' . 
  these are fact . 
  hard hitting facts at that . 
  ignoring these in favour of specific quasi-religious dogma as you do makes you a monstrous human being . 
  they have `` canards '' which are small protrusions that are almost impossible to make out from the ground without significant magnification . 
  they are also present on all modern flanker family aircraft . 
  the main thing that actually differentiates this particular aircraft is rear facing radar radome . 
  unfortunately that is also very difficult to see from the ground . 
  su-34 is built on the same baseline airframe design and shares the same shape with entire flanker family . 
  your claim is hilarious . 
  in fact , quite a bit of news media outlets ( including the one i read the story initially in , finnish state broadcaster ) actually presented incorrect stock picture because of visual similarity of the aircraft and had to issue a correction . 
  not to even mention that these are high altitude attack craft , and discerning shape from the ground , even if you had someone who actually saw the aircraft , is quite hard . 
  these are strike fighters , which are quite small in size and not very well visible from the ground in terms of their shape . 
  no , that belongs to `` common sense '' . 
  there 's a reason why everyone , including european powers , us and russia send aircraft to identify who they see on their radar . 
  because radar does n't have a clue what they actually see . 
  it just tells you that something is there that is reflecting the signal and gives you distance to the target . 
  you need actual aircraft in visual range for identification . 
  turkey 's claim is simply impossible , unless they have some sort of top secret new technology that us , eu states and russia do n't possess . 
  claim # 1 : no additional cuts made this year due to refugee crisis . 
  patently false as size of the crisis started to become apparent in the middle of previous year when some of these decisions were made . 
  to pretend that they did n't affect them is to pretend that politicians live in a perfect bubble . 
  they may live in a kind of a bubble , but most certainly not a perfect one . 
  claim # 2 : unions are as strong as sitting government . 
  patently false . 
  unions have no impact on foreign policy , limited impact on domenstic policy and very limited impact on budget . 
  all of these things are direct responsibilty of a government . 
  to suggest what you suggest requires complete lack of comprehension of how government and political system works in finland . 
  claim # 3 : government is happy about immigration because it lets them scapegoat . 
  patently false . 
  government 's democratic support numbers are in the gutter , and 2/3 parties in the government make a point of being humanitarian and not blaiming refugees . 
  instead , they are willing to blame everything from russia to bad economic situation to unions . 
  but not refugees . 
  only the finns party is willing to call refugee crisis a main problem . 
  claim # 4 refugees have no priority in housing . 
  patently false . 
  cheap public housing is available on `` need '' basis . 
  refugees being considered the most vulnerable get priority as their need is judged to be highest possible . 
  overall , you managed to get every single claim wrong . . 
  did you even read the translated version ? 
  it 's right in it  long before the disappearance of the girl she had apparently had sexual contact to a turk and a german turk . 
  the authorities in the framework of the investigations were aware of it . 
  berlin prosecutors investigating the two men suspected of severe child sexual abuse . 
  it does actually , because you really ca n't break agreements any more than swedes did . 
  russians have less obligations as we do not have equivalent of dublin agreement signed between us and russia as we do between us and sweden , and yet they control the border better . 
  then we most certainly have very different views on our nation 's people helping each other . 
  russia so far has been a far better neighbour in this regard than sweden , in spite of the fact that they have a whole lot more of these migrants , they 're in a much worse financial situation and they have far less obligations as they are not a part of eu or shengen , unlike sweden . 
  considering your views , should n't you be focusing on the far bigger problem on the western border first ? 
  we obviously can , because they are migrating . 
  the world is merely a descriptor of process of migration and completely agnostic to reasons behind it . 
  what an odd argument to have .

  it 's truly bizarre how people like amber rudd speak about overseas ( non-eu ) students who usually pay very hefty tuition fees ( therefore tending to be rich , and spending lots of money ) then to leave after . 
  maybe i 'm missing something but i 'd think those would be the type of immigrant you 'd most want to attract to your country , but she talks about them ( along with all other immigrants ) like they are sewer rats . 
  i 'm glad the irish at least can gain something from this . 
  i think actual elections / referendums are a more accurate predictor . 
  it 's pretty obvious that the only country that should be red is the uk , nobody else voted against eu, 
  is this a joke ? 
  these are all pretty well known places, 
  this comes to mind : https://pbs.twimg.com/media/c_tlsbjw0aad0de.jpg, 
  they are n't `` ready '' because they still think eu doesnt mean all the stuff they 've repeatedly said over the last year and will give them everything they want . 
  hope reality starts sinking in soon, 
  you said 10million / year . 
  that is not happening in the uk , so stop making such claims to back your xenophobic arguments, 
  that 's a huge exaggeration regarding the immigration numbers of uk . 
  finland population is 5 million so you are suggesting twice the existing population in immigration in one year . 
  with uk population at ~ 65 m , you are suggesting uk net immigration is 130m a year which is total bullshit , quick google search tells me in 2016 for uk it 's 248k !, 
  the equivalent for finland would be 19k , which is fine do n't even bother commenting if you are gon na make outrageous claims like uk net annual immigration is 130million or even 10 million, 
  why are you so upset and angry about immigrants coming to your country and contributing to society and paying taxes ? 
  ok maybe they are worth more in terms of tax they pay , my point was more that unskilled immigrants also contribute and are a benefit to the country so its a case of uk shooting themselves in foot with their attitude, 
  its truly bizarre that the uk think the eu needs them more than vice versa and they would be fine with no deal . 
  its true that eu will lose some trade with uk ( though no individual eu country is as affected as uk , except unfortunately ireland may come a close 2nd ) but thats pretty much it - uk loses every eu institution they are in , `` frictionless '' trade with eu and all the fta 's they currently have . 
  yep - the most educated/skilled eu citizens ( and even uk citizens ) that i know have already left the country with job offers in eu ( myself included ) . 
  the lower skilled ones who have it harder to find a job will probably also leave but may take a bit longer . 
  not that i think skilled immigrant is `` worth more '' than lower skilled as each is needed , its just the uk govt that keeps going on about it, 
  seriously ? 
  your argument is basically that we deserved to get attacked because we wanted independence ( from both russia and sweden ) ? 
  agree but i think i read somewhere that post-brexit guardian articles are attracting quite a lot of commentary from brexiteers specifically because they disagree with it . 
  there are pro-eu comments as well, 
  wow reading the comments on the article gave me cancer . 
  it 's bizarre how all these brexiteers talk about the `` big bad eu '' as if the uk wasnt a major part of it themselves over the last 40 years . 
   i 'm glad that we managed to keep finland away from soviet hands oh please . 
  i think you are giving sweden far * far * too much credit in the winter war , they were never even officially involved despite the pleading of finland . 
  yep , that seems to be the case, 
  i guess we lose 1 member , gain another ? 
  i 'm cool with that !, 
  lol and so much for the uk re-establishing ties with the `` commonwealth '', 
  i never realised the common adder ( vipera berus ) which we call kyyk\u00e4\u00e4rme was so widespread across europe and not just finland ( not that its massively common , dont think i 've ever seen one ) guess we are n't the special snowflake i thought we were . 
  i thought the point of brexit was to get foreigners to flee the uk - they dont seem to make any distinction between skilled or unskilled , or professionals in areas where they are skill shortages . 
  i recommend the nordics, 
  same here - i left last year as well . 
  i think the `` highly skilled '' workers are able to find work in eu much easier , so they are more likely to leave and more quickly . 
  luckily i 'm finnish so not worried about my ability to stay !, 
  thats a kind explanation of it ( to the dutch ) . 
  it was a dutch comedian who joked about how finland * always * beats netherlands in these league tables , even if by only 1 point . 
  thats the source of the rivalry, 
  you mean the e-cigarette ? 
  totally - its a new thing since 2011 ( or sometime after ) as far as i 'm concerned ? 
  and increasing in popularity ? 
  is it over elsewhere , and why ? 
  how are you `` last '' ? 
  ( older population ? ), 
  and i 'm assuming you comparing to other baltic states instead of the rest of europe , as there are countries on both sides of you in these categories ? 
  assuming he 's been kept locked in a room with not much access to media over the last 6 years , i wonder what news / developments in the world will be most surprising to him ? 
  crimea ? 
  vaping now being a thing ? 
  it 's been a long time . 
  i saw this in the finnish news , a lot of the comments said it was disgraceful to `` make fun of '' poor people in this way . 
  i dont think its the case though , its for a good cause ( helping the poor ) and any kind of marketing needs to be eye-catching to be effective . 
  people need to chill . 
  it was pretty pro-brexit about a year ago , maybe not so much these days . 
  pro-brexit posts were upvoted and pro-eu posts downvoted to death . 
  nothing new here . 
  they are allowed to stay if the conditions of x , y and z and others are met , such as reciprocal agreement etc. 
  even better !, 
  lol though i was only quoting my personal experience, 
  i dont know why they are there , but perhaps the same reason you are on r/europe ? 
  lots of brexiteers joined r/europe since brexit , maybe same reason why left wing types join r/ukpolitics, 
  `` hey !, 
  i 'm irish ! '', 
  `` really , where in ireland are you from ? '', 
  `` i dont know '' ... 
  how do you know the number of subscribers of r/europe by nationality ? 
  r/europe , though not explicitly , is fairly pro-eu , and more irish ( as a % ) than brits are pro-eu . 
  i guess those missing brits spend their time on r/ukpolitics which is pro-brexit ( or at least was , till reality sunk in ), 
  yea especially given the last 6 months of trump , i 'm surprised people are still so trusting . 
  fair enough - i assumed it was an official vote leave ad but i guess anyone could 've made such a video, 
  i dont know if many countries do but from my experience i 've always had to put up with roaming fees till now . 
  i dont think anyone ( particularly not eu politicians ) claim brexit is anyway neutral for eu . 
  they have repeatedly said its bad for all , including eu , which is why they keep saying it sucks . 
  the only thing is that it wont be * as * bad for eu as uk . 
  maybe a small thing but i would 've included lack of roaming fees also . 
  peace on the continent is good too . 
  still , it was a `` vote leave '' ad , so fair to presume its a brexiteer thing , even if the company hired to make seems to be american for the reasons you suggested . 
  this is a `` vote leave '' ad , so was definitely prior to the vote , before they got what they wanted as you say . 
  it says so at the end, 
  well its working . 
  i appreciate eu more in the last year than ever before . 
  well said . 
  with her attempt to race to the bottom already 2 years in advance , there will be nothing further to offer once shit hits the fan after brexit, 
  the scary bit is the type of propaganda coming from the uk brexiteers , not further eu integration . 
  the winning side is finland , so . . 
  yep . 
  if she ca n't help because that 's the right thing to do , you 'd think she 'd at least do it for the sake of good pr, 
  true but that never means that everyone gets exactly what they want - all benefits of eu membership cos some want it , none of the liabilities cos some do n't want those . 
  that 's not how it works, 
  has n't theresa may faced enough criticism recently to at least think helping these people may be a good idea ?!, 
  sounds like a dictatorship when people can behave this way ( and i guess seems now also breaking international agreements like gfa ) and expect to maintain power, 
  i can understand the importance of keeping rights of eu citizens in the uk who moved to uk in good faith and are at risk of losing right to stay through no fault of their own , but i dont understand why uk citizens who voted out of eu should keep eu citizen rights ? 
  thats precisely what they voted for !, 
  aww . . cute !, 
  i guess we are friends with sweden .

  to me most of eurovision sounds like noise with no backstory . 
  it 's almost as if it was up to personal preferences . 
  sure , i just noted that by doing that the owner could very well end up homeless himself . 
  damage done to that single mcdonald 's franchiser is pretty significant , quite possibly ending his business . 
  it 's completely unfair to expect the owner to run a homeless center . 
  if someone feels like he should , maybe they should take a few homeless people to live in their place . 
  as you said , the civilized way is to arrange the society in a way that people do n't need to be homeless in the first place . 
  they do n't need anyone to sign contracts for themselves , nor does their producer influence the songs any more than any other producer . 
  they write their music themselves , they wanted to perform at the competition themselves and had to go through a competition in finland which allowed them to participate after winning it . 
  they even were n't the choice of the jury in that competition , so much for your `` corporate agenda '' . 
  the fact is , we as a people thought they were the best act and voted them heavily enough to get them through _ despite _ the `` corporate '' jury wanting someone else . 
  you 're free to not like them but they are the guys we wanted to go . 
  so the problem was lack of melody and screaming ? 
  are you sure you 're familiar with punk ? 
  not if you run a mcdonald 's . 
  great . 
  keep at it , guys !, 
  rarely anything out of the ordinary . 
  yeah , we just need to get someone with boobs to stand next to wind machine singing the last years winning song from now on . 
  naw , fuck it . 
  i 'd rather lose in style from now on . 
  the lucky lukes of europe . 
  came to see finnish at the top . 
  done . 
  pretty muscular to be `` obese '' , yes . 
  for over 25 you only need to be generally sturdy . 
  i do n't think it 's as indicative of fat after that point . 
  you do n't have a lot of muscle mass to be over 25 . 
  she does n't and i 'd definitely vote for her too . 
  all i meant was that the world is full of people who rather lie about uncomfortable small things to their loved ones to keep them happy than tell the ugly truth when there 's practically no way to get caught in a lie . 
  there 's nothing wrong with that . 
  which would work if the person is reasonable . 
  as we have all seen from reddit , bunch of people lack the balls to do that and/or lie to avoid an unpleasant scene . 
  what would you say if your spouse , family member or a coworker was running ? 
  i agree it seems odd that multiple people claim to have voted for him but it 's not proof of anything . 
  edit : apparently i not reddit very good . 
  i meant to respond to the one comment above this one ... 
  it 's not proven in any way . 
  he might have voted for someone else or filled his slip wrong in someway in an attempt to vote for himself . 
  zlatan took off about 85 mins per match in milan , though , he just used the remaining 5 to win the game alone . 
  do you guys sell the antimagnetic dishwashers separately ? 
  i hate it when my iron pans always come flying from the stove and stick to the diswasher when i turn it on . 
  if people answered to all the stupid shit they do nobody had time to do anything else . 
  since true finns multiplied their base several times over in the last parlamentary elections they had some pretty wacko people elected . 
  my favourite one is an older guy who , despite claiming he does n't drink at all before he got elected , managed to pass out at a local hell 's angels subdivision headquarters forgetting his briefcase filled with government papers after him , got himself into a some sort of online dating scam with a woman , sent dick picks to another and randomly appeared completely hammered all over , including at work , during his four years in the parliament . 
  and he was n't even the guy who got kicked out of the party . 
  after all that , last night he apparently got 64 % more votes than the last time and got in for a second term !, 
  i 'm at loss for words . 
  i have a few friends in downtown helsinki with gas stoves , one of them is kind of fat , so i suppose the fat one uses about 60 % and the other one about 40 % of our gas . 
  the graph is really misleading for finland , the amount of gas we use is negligible . 
  being part of any sanctions back in the cold war days would 've been completely impossible . 
  finlandization was so strong that anyone in politics who even spoke too harshly about anything to do with the soviet union was sure to find themselves off the trail . 
  only way to bring back that atmosphere would be for russia to intimidate finland ( and other neighboring countries as well ) back to finlandization , which seems to be what they are trying to do . 
  probably not entirely to get others in line but to keep russia united . 
  well that 's all about how you define things . 
  i agree with both interpretations , personally . 
  i believe they look something [ like this ] ( http://www.hel.fi/wps/wcm/connect/07feba00433ac2fd9996df09ead44af8/2/kelluva-sauna-web.jpg?mod=ajperes&amp;cacheid=07feba00433ac2fd9996df09ead44af8/2 ), 
  coincidentally , we have a saying `` a russian is a russian even when fried in butter . '', 
  not sure if he still is if accidentally burned . 
   two nuclear states i bet that would go splendidly . 
  so finland can into baltic ? 
  in finland there 's also no russian minority within the society , they are well integrated within the finnish society as a whole , not keeping to themselves in segregated towns or strong russian communities . 
  basically they 're just people who also speak russian and sometimes have a perverted desire to cheer for a hockey team in red jerseys as well as white . 
  i guess that 's the biggest difference to former soviet countries , to me it seems their russian population was often moved there during soviet rule or left on the wrong side of the border at some point . 
  i can see how that could create some tension between different groups . 
  pretty much all the parties are for increasing or keeping the same military budget after the coming elections , to my understanding . 
  the need to cut costs is real , but it does n't mean the savings should be taken from everything equally . 
  given the current situation , savings on military spending that has already had pretty hefty cuts and is in need of a few major investments in the near future , is n't smart . 
  i 've always found that reasoning really stupid . 
  it 's not like they would be hauling people from their homes to join a war somewhere , nato does n't work like that and our constitution does n't work like that . 
  also , we already have more volunteers than needed for peace keeping missions and rapid deployment forces as it is , in all likelihood those would be the kind of operations we would be participating as a nato country . 
  letting a volunteer go and do what they think is right is n't a bad thing , i wish them well and any casualties are obviously bad , but the people know the risks and are willing to go despite of them . 
  interesting , makes sense . 
  that 's a tough situation to correct , hoping for the economy to get some traction would probably be the biggest thing to help the situation . 
  you 'd think the ones selling them would lower the prices ? 
  in finland as well . 
  although i went to school from 92 onwards , but i suppose they still have presidents on the wall . 
  i do n't see it as political in the same way as we had at least half a dozen former presidents in there , not only the current one . 
  it seemed kind of educational , `` here 's the faces of our recent presidents so you know them '' kind of thing . 
   humorous shut up already . 
  you guys are n't part of it . 
  as i 'm sure you 're aware . 
  that 's possible , languages are similar enough to understand bits here and there . 
  i have no idea about estonian dubbing habits , though . 
  any private channel should obviously broadcast whatever they like but i do n't find it appropriate to broadcast only one type of religious worship while simultaneously legally obligated to be for equality between groups . 
  especially when people who believe something completely else are forced to pay for it . 
  the least they should do is to be inclusive of all angles or stay out of practicing religion completely . 
  i agree with you . 
  in the later part i was n't referring to your post , just a general observation about the current situation . 
  having everyone in finland pay a specific tv tax to promote one religion over all others does n't seem fair so i thought maybe it should be changed to something like this permanently , programs about all religions in cultural context . 
  actually i remember people objecting to reading the bible too when they did a similar series with that . 
  although i 'm strongly non-religious and would like to see the state separated from church , i rather them air these shows than have church services broadcasted regularly . 
  holy books of different religions are culturally and historically significant but i do n't think it 's up to the state to promote only one sect of one religion on a weekly basis . 
  in the back where the poor mortals have to travel , probably ... 
  that 's the reason they gave us . 
  then again , cv90 can be pressurized if needed . 
  we still had masks in finland , you have to leave the tank eventually . 
  true , i 'm just holding on to my deal until they try to end the offer and either change for whoever has the best deal that week or talk them to continue the -50 % deal . 
  that is unless a better deal comes around before that . 
  the market seems to work surprisingly well up here for a consumer .

  t-shirt what i am wearing at the moment is tagged with text : made in bangladesh . 
  where is the shirt you are using manufactured ? 
  maybe this was enough of moral . 
  --  the second counterargument is that the services provided by the state are essentially geographic monopolies , so even the ones you think of as morally commendable ( education , healthcare , etc ) are provided in a very inefficient way ... 
  privatization is good , and it 's bad . 
  difference on it is that private company have to make profit to work . 
  if the winnings margin is not enough for owner it will decrease the investment money to service it products . 
  for example here in finland is quite much of debate about the free meals in school kids . 
  every kid in primary school and in high school gets a free meal each school day in finland . 
  there are many schools in each municipality and each got own kitchen . 
  now after privatization there is only one large kitchen what products all the food and brings the food to schools with cars . 
  it gives a saving to municipality because old way cost 2 000 000 $ and after privatization it only cost 1 900 000 $ but it decreased a quality on it . 
  it fill the requirements of food but is it good when potatoes are `` rubber potatoes '' because the potatoes were boiled without the peel . 
  because this varies in each municipality i do n't bring any source . 
  another example is [ vehicle inspection ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mot_test ) what is mandatory to do in every year here in finland . 
  in finland here used to be government owned company what got largest market share . 
  but at 2003 government sold suomen autokatsastus oy to private sector and what it caused : - pricing increased - small companies have been driven out . 
  positive about that is vehicle inspection stations are open for longer time each day and now they offer coffee for customers - service is better . 
  because of the slow bureaucracy in finland it seems that the status of small companies is not going any easier in future what would decrease the price . 
  i am not saying all privatization is bad . 
  some tasks are totally okay to be done by private sector .

  ** bit old [ data ] ( http://www.trafi.fi/filebank/a/1321969240/cd706fe6ef12f53357dc7dc4298f5717/1298-ake207selvityskatsastustoiminnanhintakehityksesta.pdf ) about the vehicle inspection but page 17 tells in english that 150 % rise in payment from 1994 to 2007 . 
  current ** average ** prices from [ katsastushinnat.fi ] ( http://www.katsastushinnat.fi/ ) website are today : - inspection 44.43 $ - [ obd ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/on-board_diagnostics ) 13.62 $ - exhaust gas for petrol engines 18.51 $ ( total 76.56 $ ) or diesel 29.18 $ ( total 87.23 $ ) exhaust gas test can be done in authorized repair station . 
  obd is done for cars manufactured 2001 or later . 
  more taxes are only good because it 's more moneys to public services . 
  i think there is no cap how good such services are . 
  well , all state authorities have to serve with finnish and swedish language in every municipality in finland . 
  it is officials duty to use interpreter if neither citizen or official use another language enough good . 
  actually , they can go to easter finland and demand ~ ~ any ~ ~ state public service with swedish language ... that 's the law .

  well , winter war began with soviet attack to finland 30.11.1939 and ended to peace 13.3.1940 . 
  great britain and france decided to send troops to finland ( other side of coin is that they wished to block the ore transports to germany from swedish [ kiruna mine ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kiruna_mine ) . 
  28.3.1940 allied forces planned to mine norwegian waters so german vessels have to stay in open waters - they did n't mine any waters before german attack to denmark and norway 9.4.1940 .

  does your railroad company ( s ) say same excuses than in your eastern neighbor that there is snow on the rails at winter and it 's raining at summer ? 
  that ca n't be correct . 
  finnish valtionrautatiet ca n't be that good . 
  vr is kinda hated in public here . 
  where you were ? 
  you can continue to spread your pirate/lefty butthurtism but you have to remember - the representative you mock is part of party in opposition . 
  in opposition you can only speak , sign the iniatives and question the coalition members . 
  [ there ] ( http://kansanmuisti.fi/member/hakkarainen-teuvo/?as.type.st=1&amp;as.type.si=1&amp;as.type.in=1&amp;as.type.wq=1 ) is a nice website in finnish language you can follow what each represantive have and have not done . 
  with your logic the future prime minister is in same boat - he also were in outside of coalition . 
  do you mock him for doing nothing ? 
  to work , study or follow your love - sure , no problem . 
   people vote wrong sometimes exept people ca n't vote `` wrong '' . 
  you can disagree with that x percent of people but that x percent is direct share of population on area . 
  he probably meant word : coalition . 
  yeh , there is [ 2011 version ] ( http://www2.hs.fi/extrat/kotimaa/puoluekentta/ ) for comparison . 
  pretty conservative there . 
  national coalition party is liberal , not conservative . 
  the finns party is conservative . 
  - centre - kesk - national coalition party - kok - the finns - ps - social democrats - sdp - greens - vihr - leftist - vas - swedish people 's party - rkp - christian democrats - kd and - vasemmisto - left wing - oikeisto - right wing - liberaali - liberal - konservatiivi - conservative, 
  kesk wont allow vas to join the cabinet because it would turn the scale too left . 
  rkp could be an option if ps promises not to touch swedish language teaching in schools for next 4 years - it 's a big thing for ps but the minister audi is more important . 
  green party is not okay for kesk for ideological reasons and kd is so signfiant it wont help at all but could do harm in future . 
  this is pretty good text about how nokia died .

  pretty scary reading . 
  you forget ps what makes things a bit easier when future prime minister can pick two big parties with them to cabinet . 
  for example the iltalehti ( not a best source for this i know ) predicted [ that ] ( http://static.iltalehti.fi/eduskuntavaalit-2015/vaaligraf7mp_eb.jpg ) kind of result . 
  the elections will be close to that according the polls we have and if unless there is nothing surpricing . 
  keskusta wishes to get in cabinet with sdp to form old `` puna-multa - red-soil ? '', 
  because so called `` porvari-burgher '' cabinet did n't go so good in the past . 
  also ps wishes to join the cabinet for first time ever . 
  quite common in europe .

  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/party_of_european_socialists#member_parties lithuania , germany , sweden , switzerland etc. 
  the public sector is really massive so it requires a lot of tax incomes from private sector . 
  finland have been doing something we call cheese slicer policy - cut a bit from everything . 
  basically we need two massive reforms to get balance on economy . 
  - [ municipal mergers in regions ] ( http://vm.fi/en/artikkeli/-/asset_publisher/expansion-of-government-powers-with-regard-to-municipal-mergers-will-not-proceed?_101_instance_chtsflfececq_redirect=%2fen%2fsearch%2f-%2fq%2fmunicipalities ) - [ social welfare and health care reform ] ( http://www.stm.fi/en/ministry/strategies/service_structures ) we really need those 2 to get passed asap and our economy to grow because we will have big expenses in the future because our future army reforms . 
  we need new ships for our navy and new fighters for our air force from 2025 onwards . 
  both need a separate funding - but it seems we ca n't have all what we were planned to have . 
  it 's unfortunately because there always will be an army in finland - our own or foreign , not both . 
  it 's amazing how people used to vote same parties in every elections . 
  i have to admit that things went good prior 2007 financial crisis so i do n't understand the result of elections of 2011 . 
  also it makes things go hard if every prime minister after lipponen 2 leaves the office before the elections .

  i think being involved in war is much more acceptable when its in a defensive rather than offensive capacity so generally yes i would prefer us to stop invading countries , but no , i would welcome help from us if europe got invaded , and i hope they would because it would be in their best interest too . 
  also the eu is n't a country , so its not like for like comparison about who would be involved . 
  first you say us gains from eastern europeans being in nato , next you say they dont gain anything . . 
   in the last 12 years the us has gobbled up nearly all the former pro-russia satellite states in europe . 
  so much wrong with this statement . 
  us has n't * taken * anything , nobody forced those eastern europeans into nato , they wanted to be in nato . 
  those supposed former pro-russia satellite states were hardly pro-russia . 
  their independence was taken away without choice , thats not pro - russian by any stretch of the imagination . 
  the statement in itself conveys a pro-putin stance , regardless of whether you openly admit it . 
  or did you just not know that its pro-putin when you just repeat whatever trump says ? 
  why does russia have a rightful sphere of influence ? 
  should n't it be the choice of the individual country which sphere of influence they want to be in ? 
  whats with all the pro-putin chat coming out of americans these days ? 
  we now feel that russia is the victim for the baltics wanting to join nato for some pretty obvious reasons ? 
  not at all - my point was merely trump-bashing . 
  i did say he wasnt a good guy by any means, 
  but how many of these countries need to be annexed before it would worry the americans ? 
  if they get 1 without consequence , why not 2 ? 
  us also seems pretty trigger happy for war , why not put that mind set to a good use ? 
  to be fair , it was a bit less than half . . hillary did win popular vote . 
  yea i never would 've guessed an * estonian * of all people would be pro-trump given his chat about nato . 
  mccain is hardly a good guy but suddenly would be a dream president elect, 
  really ? 
  not russia instead ? 
  maybe i need to get my eyes checked . 
  also the slightly higher figure in a * part * of finland is probably due to low population , as in 1 homicide could skew the rate due to low population while 1 homicide itself hardly conveys a murder problem . 
  yes it does explain it because the low population means 1 homicide would change the rate and this 1 random homicide could 've occurred in northern norway or sweden instead of finland because 1 homicide hardly suggests homicide is a big problem in the area . 
  guess in this 1 years worth of stats it happened to be finland . 
  lol we say the same , suomi mainittu !, 
  thats not the north sea , thats the north atlantic ocean . 
  north sea is more eastern, 
  not really . . why would they care ? 
  i didnt suggest that pride in the the british empire was based on knowledge about it . . 
  newspapers , uk politicians with minimal effort : http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/british-people-are-proud-of-colonialism-and-the-british-empire-poll-finds-a6821206.html https://www.reddit.com/r/ukpolitics/comments/4z1v37/tory_mp_tweets_image_claiming_british_empire_won/ ? 
  are you seriously trying to claim that india for example enjoyed being a colony and would like to go back to that ? 
  i dont mention other european colonial empires , not because i think they were much better , but because you dont see a lot of nostalgia on the issue from those countries but you definitely do from the uk . 
  they briefly mentioned it - those two would be a bit smaller population wise but a lot richer than ( what would be ) a fairly impoverished british empire . 
  oh christ the brits really need to stop with these dreams of the british empire coming back . 
  the colonies did * not * want to be colonised and do not remember it as fondly as the brits . 
  yea , i thought people were saying it like that would be * such * a 2016 thing to happen :(, 
  wow , i saw this mentioned elsewhere on reddit and thought it was a joke !, 
  he was so young . 
  yes . 
  all is not lost yet because its not certain what type of brexit it is . 
  but people who seemingly didnt want brexit seem to be happy with theresa may proceeding with the most isolationist approach possible . 
  funny how nobody seems to have voted for brexit but more than happy to accept the life-changing result so easily . . 
  that is certainly not my experience on r/europe . 
  and i 'm pretty sure you are n't one of those that like europe , given the topic of your post . 
  thanks !, 
  why is this article being down voted ? 
  is it eurosceptics who want angela merkel to be at fault ? 
  i 'm pro-eu but even if i wasnt , i would n't find any joy in believing the controls in place are n't working at all . 
  i 'm really annoyed that this sub has become mainly brits trolling europeans since the brexit vote . 
  yes they do . 
  even the vatican with their swiss guards ? 
  well brexit and closing borders does n't suggest openness by any stretch of the imagination . 
  neither does colonising countries by force , if that 's what you referred to, 
  yea first time i 've heard someone claim valio is n't finnish at all , only a transit state for valio products . 
  i think its more than 1 , but i can list many other things said by uk politicians . 
  such as : the eu need uk more than vice versa ; we hope the eu collapses these are pretty hostile things to say imo, 
  not really a stupid comparison , what is stupid is some uk politicians saying the eu should pay the uk for access to their single market , which is a good way to reach hermit kingdom status ( within europe , anyway ) . 
  yes , someone has to make the decision and she should be the one to make it , but its a huge one that should have * oversight * . 
  it would n't be necessary for her to wait until the very late stage to get oversight ( where there is no way to backtrack ) , if she wasnt so secretive . 
  i dont know what their assumptions were at the time when they voted for referendum to take place , but they agreed to a referendum , not necessarily for theresa may to exclude parliament from all decisions on the matter going forward . 
  yea you are probably right actually but i think her insistence on micromanaging wo n't help her case if parliament gets the vote on article 50 ( which is yet to be determined by the court ) , as this then means they will be voting on whether or not to give her a blank check, 
  well if there is no oversight on the brexit deal , may can choose the deal ? 
  so total isolation or norway type deal ( though unsure what that norway option looks like since they wo n't get into efta ) . 
  the 51st state one was just an exaggeration . 
  i dont think the article is correct . 
  i dont think mp 's voting no means that uk still leaves but without a deal , it means theresa may ca n't invoke article 50 and uk wo n't leave . 
  but its yet to be determined by the court whether they need to be given a vote at all . 
  thats one way to get them to vote no though , if the only options are to give the government a blank check or not . 
  i dont see why they should trust theresa may or any other individual to make all these big decisions on their own !, 
  she would have free reign to become north korea , norway or a 51st us state . 
  civil war is still war . 
  hardly peaceful . 
  i dont think nato rules require countries to join in on illegal wars another nato country decides to start , only if they are genuinely under attack and the us was not under attack by iraq by any stretch of the imagination . 
  what is the argument for denmark not being nordic ? 
  just curious . 
  chill , its a joke . 
  nobody gets ` called in ' to war , the uk government decides themselves whether to go in !, 
  nor do i believe the uk bombs countries for that countries own protection , its for the same reasons as the us ( self-interest ) . 
  in addition to all of that , i 'm surprised that people feel the british isles are peaceful apart from `` a few years '' given what happened in northern ireland for 30 years . 
  yea but thats slang not accent . . i think helsinki has the most neutral accent if any accent at all in comparison to other places ( though i may be biased ) , but agree regarding the slang though . 
  i think it maybe to do with the stuff that happened after franco died since this map is from 70 's onward ? 
  not an expert either though . 
  no offense , but i wouldnt consider the uk to be one of the * less * war mongering countries of europe, 
  not funny, 
  i mean the pic doesnt have much snow !, 
  there is more snow in the south than this picture has , thats why i 'm unsure if its finland, 
  not swedes specifically , but eu nationals which includes them . 
  its not mutually exclusive . 
  you can curse banks and still believe you need them in your country !, 
  yep , everything seems to always be followed by `` given it is approved by all other countries , which i 'm sure it will '' ... 
  looks like finland , but there is n't that much snow so unsure . . 
  it is n't racist to say illegal working practices are a problem , what is racist is to say that eu immigrants `` often work cash in hand for below the minimum wage '' ( exact quote from you ) . 
  highly skilled professionals do not undercut unskilled labouring jobs , but it is relevant to your argument when you claim most eu immigrants work in these unskilled jobs . 
  i dont think there 's a lot of specific anti-nordic sentiment but anti-eu sentiment , which includes nordics . 
  funny you mention `` misplaced '' anger when everything else you say tries to justify the anger . 
  your entire argument is based on the assumption that most eu immigrants in the uk are ( illegally ) working cash in hand and avoiding tax , which is not the case and also very offensive .

  but even some hashid , who were called to take up arms by the country 's top shi'ite cleric , are leaving . 
  a 20-year-old shi'ite fighter from the eastern province of diyala , who declined to identify himself or the specific militia he belonged to , said pro-government forces receive inadequate support to fight islamic state . 
  he recently made a month-long journey to sweden to join two cousins who are themselves former iraqi police officers . 
  `` you can not fight a war or live in a country under these circumstances , '' he told reuters via facebook from the stockholm area . 
  the politicians `` ransacked the country in the name of religion . 
  iraq is not ours anymore ; we are merely tenants . '', 
  reuters could not independently verify the fighter 's identity . 
  hashid spokesman ahmed al-asadi could not provide an accurate count for fighters who had migrated , but said the government needed to do more to keep young iraqis from leaving . 
  reforms launched last month by prime minister haider al-abadi seek to end a system of ethnic and sectarian quotas that has spawned corruption and mismanagement . 
  the reforms also aim to improve accountability in the military and other state institutions . 
  but the initiative , hindered by bureaucracy and political jockeying , has led to few noticeable gains on the battlefield or improvements in people 's daily lives ; many lack basic services such as electricity . 
  though iraqis have been fleeing poor government , violence and economic hardship for decades , recent policy shifts in europe have presented a fresh opportunity to escape . 
  looking on this summer as refugees from neighboring syria received a warm reception in europe , many decided to leave at short notice , using facebook and other social media to plan their trips . 
  the united nations estimates hundreds of thousands more could leave iraq in the coming months . 
  but the soldiers arriving in europe face an unknown future . 
  a spokeswoman for u.n. refugee agency unhcr said those judged to be former combatants would not be granted refugee status . 
  ( additional reporting by isabel coles in erbil and tom miles in geneva , editing by timothy heritage ), 
  meanwhile , thousands of migrants have crossed the northern border from sweden to finland . 
  so far there has been 12471 asylym applications this year and of those 2812 applications last week alone ( unclear how many unregistered persons in addition to those ) . 
  and by far the majority of them are young men , and most of the applicants are from iraq . 
  in finland of all the registered asylym applicants this year about 62 % are from iraq , 13 % from somalia , 5 % from afganistan , then some from albania , kosovo etc. 
  what is remarkable is that even with the thousands of recent arrivals only 297 applicants or about 2 % are from syria . 
   iraq is n't a country ?? 
   us did n't have any slightest chance with soviets at that time . 
  the us was the only country that had nukes . 
   i 'd kinda expect that if the pohjanmaa could do the job , so could either of the other two . 
  pohjanmaa needed significant technical changes and special rigging for the operation atalanta . 
  there 's no reason to expect that just because pohjanmaa could do somehing then also other ships can . 
  in fact the contrary is more likely true : because the minelayer pohjanmaa needed significant changes it is likely that also the h\u00e4meenmaa-class minelayers would need . 
  after all , they 're all designed as minelayers operating on finnish coastal waters . 
  great . 
  now please tell me how are they suitable for * the mission * . 
  because it 's not about whether the are any ships that can stay afloat on the mediterranean . 
   he told the newspaper keskisuomalainen on thursday that the government 's foreign and security committee has tentatively approved the deployment . 
  however it will depend on whether the finnish defence forces can borrow a boat from another eu state . 
  poor reporting . 
  he never said that . 
  the finnish defence forces are not asking to borrow a boat . 
  here 's the original news source in finnish : http://www.ksml.fi/uutiset/kotimaa/suomi-lahettaa-20-sotilasta-valimerelle/2129425 the finnish defence forces do not have a suitable ship for a mission on the mediterranean now that [ the minelayer pohjanmaa ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/finnish_minelayer_pohjanmaa ) , which participated in action against somali pirates in [ the operation atalanta ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/operation_atalanta ) , is being decommissioned . 
  that means the only way for the fdf to participate in a mission on the mediterranean is to send a detachment that would operate from some other ship . 
  they 're not seeking to borrow a boat but looking for a ship that would have the detachment onboard . 
   and what about human rights and so on ? 
  well , the human traffickers may have human rights too but that does not mean they have a right to smuggle people . 
  that is in fact criminal activity . 
  i 'm sorry , explain what ? 
  well i for one can see quite a few `` certain things '' that should not be public even in a most transparent democracy . 
  what matters is the context and the data . 
  that is the only way one can be consistent in demanding protection of privacy ( good ) on one hand while also demanding more transparency ( also good ) . 
  i see wholesale claims such as yours counterproductive to both those ends . 
  i hope that is not your purpose . 
   what should she have done ? 
  quietly suspend dublin ii and hope nobody notices ? 
  or maybe she could have been clear that she has no powers to suddenly `` suspend dublin ii '' for the eu countries , and that she is not doing that . 
  i mean , how the hell would she even `` suspend dublin ii '' for say finland ? 
  where the fuck did she get such powers anyway ? 
   as a whole , the message is perfectly clear . 
  i 'm sorry , what has been the message of hers that is clear ? 
  because apparently hundreds of thousands risking their lives heard something else . 
  cheers !, 
  yup , i agree with the incorrect perception part as technically when you read very carefully she did not say what she appeared to say and what the hundreds of thousands of people now risking their lives to come to merkel believe is technically incorrect . 
  if only had they read the small print very carefully . 
  yet i do not see how she is not responsible for that . 
  i mean , why the fuck did she muddle her message with empty ambiguous rhetorics in the first place . 
  why the fuck do that in a crisis ? 
  because , in all honesty , what an emergency needs is more rhetorics . 
  could you provide a link to another site please ? 
  because the owner of archive.is is for some reason preventing users from some countries to access his site . 
  we do n't know why . 
  at first he gave some vague crazy sounding reasons and then never elaborated when asked . 
  well , it is redundant . 
  the fact that the images of immigrants with the isis flag clashing with police are from 2012 was already established in / r/europe yesterday , and the article presents no new facts beyond that . 
  it 's like a reporter has been browsing reddit and now the old news gets posted back here as new . 
  edit : lol , an instadownvote for informing about a simple fact . 
  and no , i 'm not complaining as complaining about coloured virtual arrows is stupid , imho . 
  just laughing and sharing the joke . 
  wow , did n't know normandy has such cool looking flag . 
  comment deleted and user banned for posting local news . 
  okay . 
  but since when has he needed more internal support ? 
  the conservatives should hire a professional video editor for this kind of stuff . 
   neutrality ? 
  neutrality about what exactly ? 
   aziz allilou is a student at the higher institute of media and communications ( isic ) and morocco world news correspondent in rabat . 
  yet so far from even being able to read pictures . 
   is that just speculation ? 
  no , it 's rather obvious . 
  look at map , think how would russia control most of the baltic sea , and the obvious ones to invade are gotland ( sweden ) and \u00c5land ( finland ) . 
  and as it 's so obvious the russians are even doing practice runs in plain sight without any need to conceal such plans . 
   you 're already covered by the eu mutual defence clause . 
  well , it 's too vague to be much of coverage for my taste . 
  depending on situation it certainly could cover sweden but there 's no guarantee on what that coverage might be , and in a situation where sweden would need such coverage it would already be too late for finland . 
  the eu may be many things but one thing it certainly is n't is swift - nor proactive . 
   and , yes , the eu could take on russia . 
  rather easily , even , the industrial backbone is just not comparable . 
  yes , in sense of military power , technology , logistics , production etc the eu could easily fend off an invasion by russia . 
  yet that does not mean that the eu would do that for any specific region . 
  why ? 
  because politics . 
  there is no concrete obligation to do that , just a vague principle . 
  and if shit hits the fan such vague clauses tend to get interpreted in a way which seem the easiest at the moment .

  it 's also much faster at 20-50mb / s ( in helsinki ) versus the free 10mb/s included in my rent .

  you also save money by not having to buy the obligatory latte everywhere .

  very happy with it . 
  i think the point here is that you do n't necessarily have to live in canada to experience these places , because you 'd still have to travel by air in either case . 
  that 's how enormous canada is , 30 times bigger than germany or finland . 
  but the funny thing is that both the uk and us were doing more than fine , even great compared to the rest of the western world . 
  jobs are/were returning to both [ us ] ( http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/sl.uem.totl.zs?locations=us&amp;start=2009 ) and [ uk ] ( http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/sl.uem.totl.zs?locations=gb&amp;start=2009 ) and the gdp growth is back to better than the 2 % target in both [ us ] ( http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/ny.gdp.mktp.kd.zg?locations=us&amp;start=2009 ) and [ uk ] ( http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/ny.gdp.mktp.kd.zg?locations=gb&amp;start=2009 ) . 
  so why did people vote for change ? 
  because the short-term certainty in both were looking good . 
  i think the lesson to be learned here is to not let emotion get in the way of checking for facts first . 
  what illegal migration ? 
  ireland was never in schengen . 
  or are you saying you want to keep the irish from stealing your jerrbs ? 
  trump already redacted his statement about building a 40-foot wall . 
  yesterday he said we will see a fence . 
  however , the populist part of trumps wall statement is n't saying there will be a wall , because it is totally possible to build a wall . 
  the populism is saying he will make `` mexico pay for it '' . 
  that simply is n't up to him . 
  the job of a politician is n't to be the expert that plans and implements new policies . 
  that 's duty is done by officials and government workers working , aka advisers . 
  the job of a politician is to choose between different solutions provided to the table by officials and select the ones in line with the voters he represents . 
  a president is n't any different , he can command officials to research new areas of governmental functions , but whether it 's implemented or not is primarily in the hands of officials who design the solution . 
  if it is n't executively viable , it wo n't even get to the stage where it 's voted on . 
  a populist knows this is how it works but will promise anything to get elected knowing fully that experts will tell him it 's impossible to implement once elected . 
  not all broken campaign `` promises '' are populism either . 
  the politicians are n't experts themselves and it 's only natural they will ( and should ) change their stance on many subjects once having discussed by actual experts on the topic and having been given a negative answer by most . 
  this is n't populism though . 
  populism would be to suggest something that can not be implemented . 
  we do n't have a free trade agreement with the us so we absolutely can implement this without violating any agreements . 
  it 's just a matter of making a case for it and see if there 's support for it . 
  did n't they also recently decide that forests are n't co2 sinks . 
  we are n't allowed to take our forests into consideration when doing our carbon emissions accounting . 
  absolutely inept decision-making there , it 's like they 've never heard of photosynthesis . 
  you kinda have to differentiate between university and universities of applied sciences . 
  you 're right concerning the latter , but that 's not really the same as what we 're talking about . 
  undergraduate degrees from universities are still more of a proof that you can work and take in new subjects . 
  no employer expects a bsc to be knowledgeable in a field beyond the basic theory . 
  you can go into finance with an undergraduate in philosophy for example . 
  that 's not how it works . 
  the point of university is to teach critical thinking . 
  this is because we ca n't have everyone being an expert on everything , that 's inefficient . 
  it 's better if we all specialise in different areas . 
  critical thinking is the ability to identify who to go to believe when working in areas you have no expertise in . 
  your degree is firstly a certificate that you passed a maturity test in critical thinking , secondly a certificate for the information you learned . 
  it 's not that easy . 
  diesel and gasoline make up a tradeoff . 
  in short : diesels are worse for those with respiratory systems . 
  because they attach to the small hairs of the respiratory tract . 
  petrols are worse for the environment because they consume more gas , especially concerning heavier vehicles . 
  this is why it is a legit question to limit diesels in cities , because the combination of emissions of all cars in traffic creates a level of particulates in the air that 's dangerous to organisms with respiratory systems . 
  but for the environment as a whole particulates are n't that dangerous whatsoever , in fact many of them are quite prevalent in nature . 
  on the other hand , diesels are a more efficient choice of engine for working cars , especially trucks . 
  this is because they produce more torque . 
  for an example let 's forget all complex engine structures for a second and only focus on na : a 6-cylinder diesel has the same towing limit as a 8-cylinder petrol for towing . 
  this is also the case for the popularity of suvs and other more heavy civilian vehicles . 
  for suvs and trucks what you want is high torque . 
  to get that torque with a petrol you need a big engine , but with a diesel you can get a similar rating with a much smaller one , thus having less overall emissions . 
  take a mercedes gle . 
  the base model in the us is a 3.5 l v6 with 370nm of torque and 302 hp . 
  in europe , the base is a 2.5 l r4 diesel with 500nm ( ! ), 
  of torque and 204 hp . 
  despite having 100 hp less the 0-100 km/h time is only half a second apart . 
  why ? 
  because this is a heavy vehicle and a big determinant in getting going is the torque . 
  maybe it 's better to look at the v6 equivalent diesel , it 's a 3l and has 620 nm of torque and 258 hp . 
  with 50 hp less than the petrol v6 , it manages a half second faster 0-100 km/h than the petrol . 
  and you know the best part ? 
  the diesel v6 consumes 37 mpg \u2248 6.4 l/100km combined , while the petrol v6 consumes 21 mpg \u2248 11.2 l/100km . 
  moral of the story : it 's wasteful to equip heavy vehicles with petrols . 
  a petrol engine is both inefficient at getting the vehicle going as well as when it comes to fuel efficiency ( because you have to stomp the gas more to utilize needed torque ) . 
  you do n't need a 5l engine to power an escalade , all it needs is a 3l diesel . 
  so yes , there 's a case for banning diesels in cities , but there 's also an equal case for banning petrol-only in larger vehicles . 
  a good solution to the latter already exists , namely hybrid systems as electric engines have their full torque disposal at get go . 
  so let 's put it like this ; in theory if we wanted to go more green ; eu should look to ban diesel-equipped ford fiesta , vw up !, 
  and skoda fabia type cars ; us should look to ban petrol only in ford f150 , dodge ram and chevrolet suburban type trucks and suvs . 
  [ yes .

  i wholeheartedly do n't really see what you 're getting at . 
  i told you that while the ideology is itself different the solution you propose is the same and so are the methods . 
  just a few days ago there was a statistic comparing anarchism and right wing extremism on this sub . 
  while the neo-nazis lead in murders and battery , anarchists were responsible for more violent crime in general . 
  so how can you say you and right-wing extremists are so different after all ? 
  you say you are for autonomy , yet you make decisions for others by destroying property , putting people in a wheelchair and even take lives . 
  i know you already said you are n't one who contributes to the statistics , but you support the movement and you said you can understand people who do . 
  i ca n't , and most people ca n't comprehend how causes you have n't even researched are reasons to kill and put people in poverty , just to prove a point . 
  lot 's of people supported hitler and stalin without themselves doing anything bad . 
  there are people doing the same for isis today as well . 
  support is not innocent if you had the possibility to take a higher ground by doing something else . 
  get new friends mate ... try out party politics for a while , most people are extreme in one or two aspects throughout their 20s and even 30s , it 's normal . 
  but realize that opinions change . 
  i was very left in my teens , then 1st year or uni i was this free-market guy wearing suit blazers and colorful pants full peacock even though i could n't afford it ( yeah , that guy ) and now over time my opinions are much less black and white and probably somewhere between greens and centre , but still having voted for 3 different parties in the last years . 
  do n't ruin your chances at life by not looking around mate . 
  this is nothing personal , just some advice . 
  you may take it or do n't , 
  you really do n't see the resemblance ? 
  really ? 
  everything you just mentioned as solutions is the same that neo-nazis believe in too . 
  masses are stupid and can not care for themselves , democracy does n't work , the hard-working underclass versus the exploitative system , protesting does n't work on its own .

   one of my best friends is from moscow . 
  he started a business and just opened a 2 person office in ukraine for some menial tasks . 
  assuming the office is in western ukraine i wonder how he 's dealing with the anti russian propaganda the country 's ukrainian speaking media is pumping out . 
  presumably if he speaks russian and they do business in russia it might not be effected so much but i ca n't imagine it being a good time for a russian to do business in ukraine, 
  well reddit * is * open source after all , we can just port a european version of it then tell the yanks and the sjw 's to get lost . 
  * maybe sweden too * ^ ^ joking ^ ^ ^ kinda, 
  got ta offload those tulips to someone, 
  knowing the stereotype about `` cheap indians '' i 'm pretty sure they would still prefer 50 % more but less reliable fifth generation pak-fa they can build themselves over expensive foreign jets they rely on other powers to construct . 
   so you are saying that russian condoms are of low quality ? 
  never tried em but i 'm guessing so otherwise why would they not be more popular if they are indeed cheaper . 
  that said condoms are just one of those things you do n't skimp on even though the cheap ones probably work fine . 
  i mean i 've looked at those lidl condoms that are like $ 3 for 12 but not even followed through on it once even though i 'm sure they have to pass the same standards as the rest . 
  do any other coins have deutchland written on them however ? 
  i always thought it was just the symbol but in any case do n't take my comment too seriously, 
  they will probably keep up tradition and go with russian fighters which give better bang for the buck since they are already collaborating on a fifth generation jet  on 9 march 2015 , media outlets reported that the countries agreed to reduce the aircraft delivery time from 92 months to 36 months with the signing of the final agreement . 
  india is also ready to forego a 50:50 work share to prevent further delays from absorption of a new technology ; both countries agreed to manufacture the first batch of aircraft in russia and for subsequent batches to be manufactured by hal under transfer of technology in fact if you ask me i think they are just shopping around for toys in the meantime  the fgfa will be predominantly armed with weapons of indian origin such as the astra , a beyond-visual-range missile ( bvr ) being developed by india . 
  although in keeping with the russian bvr doctrine of using a variety of different missiles for versatility and unpredictability to countermeasures , the aircraft is expected to have compatibility with various missile types . 
  ** the fgfa may include systems developed by third parties . 
  better still what was one of the most pro american and anti russian posters on this board doing hanging around with four russian speaking americans in beijing ? 
  you do realize the article states it 's only imported brands that they are banning . 
   any business that is conducted using us dollars or us securities comes under the oversight of us federal authorities all the more reason to speed up the process of getting off the dollar as global reserve, 
  judging by the stock photo it seems to be in commemoration of germany 's takeover of the entire eurozone, 
  while i agree with that sentiment it does n't mean we should pander to the opinions of the crazy alcoholic guy on the street corner . 
  help yes , be dictated by , no, 
  haha , 12 points from finland to romania, 
  not to mention the fact the security guard that was shot was somehow wearing a bullet proof vest against all odds . 
  thats a good point now that you put it that way , that said should n't politics represent the will of the majority anyway ? 
   the better question is why you did n't think russia responding aggressively was foreseeable , or even more , the most probable outcome . 
  to be honest i followed the ukraine revolution with great interest and never gave it more than a 25 % probability based on their passiveness regarding syria and they have a naval base there also . 
  if it was a realistic outcome why did nobody seem to expect it when it did happen and do n't forget russia did let the original orange revolution happen in ukriane without responding militarily . 
  did you see it as a realistic outcome when maidan happened as if you did i have to say congratulations you were ahead of the game , i mean we all seen the response to crimea and that was all in all one of complete disbelief from my pov . 
   except that opinion is n't legitimate wow opinions need to be * legitamate * now i presume you call a senator and formal candidate for potus egging on a mob [ no influence whatsoever ] ( http://i.imgur.com/7gpsypl.jpg ), 
  haha well the inverse propaganda is strong considering the redicilous number i downvotes i get for an opinion . 
  lets not forget the facts are you had a man who was republican candidate for potus there on stage encouraging an angry mob in kyiv but yea sure i 'm the one that is totally wrong for saying the us had quite and influence on the overthrow of a president, 
  so why is n't * this * in the megathread . 
  oh yea pro-immigration bias, 
   ters sinc eh you already know the answer to that , most do n't join and it 's in no way expected . 
  while that may be true i 've still heard of it being brought up casually in interviews especially if the interviewer themselves went through intti . 
  `` so you were medic , where were you based , '' `` oh as it happens i was ... '' the bro club is still strong, 
   no one benefits from escalating things i agree but who benefits from russia doing nothing ... the us and eu in terms of extending influence . 
  it might be messy but this is russia saying no more staying quiet while color revolutions happen on their borders . 
  they are drawing the lines and for them a lose lose is better than a win lose . 
  thats the cold truth about it, 
  why would you assume the us would have expected russia would respond aggressively in your hypothesis ? 
  if you go game theory on this we we are talking about the first action of regime change and based on russia 's response to the orange revolution the us would have to assume they would take it with perhaps gas and economic embargo but war and annexation were not expected judging by the muted response what does n't make sense is your analysis of the pros and cons of regime change for the usa before the event and it 's something they have quite clearly desired for decades . 
  i guess the better question is why am i bothering trying to speak to / r/geopolitics in / r/europe ... sigh, 
  funny how nobody in this thread mentioned the benefits of military service on your cv in finland . 
  serious nothing says `` quitter '' or `` pussy '' like choosing civil service over military and it will be used against you . 
  while that may seem unfair it is consider somewhat of a rite of passage, 
   there is apsolutly no reason for the us to meddle there . 
  no reason for the us to fuck with russia and drive a wedge between them and the eu . 
  are you serious . 
  there is every reason to do that . 
  eh it 's obvious both us and european institutions played a role in the regime change there . 
  how far it needs to go to call it a coup is the only question that 's hard to answer . 
  would it have happened without western support and influence is the better one , i 'd say no . 
  it 's funny the pre scream was almost orgasmic sounding . 
  but yea seriously fuck people who do that , how does screaming help in any way . 
  fuck cats they have enough lives . 
  you know well any cat that was in the vicinity bolted before then thing even started falling .

  oh to be young again ... first comes the `` oh shit , what if i get lost/go to the wrong plane '' then comes the `` this is cool '' followed by `` not again , wish they had sleep pods , why ca n't i just erase these next three hours '' after being trough airports about 100 times i 've got to the , `` fuck it i 'm paying to use the lounge and chill '' between flights enjoy the trip and rest assured you wont have problems . 
  judging by the greek crisis the eurozone is germany at this point, 
  i think you are paranoid . 
  put it this way , i would say 50 - 70 % of my friends portable hard drives are full of coppyright material . 
  if everyone has it why would they pick on you ? 
  oh i know the banks are responsible and equally responsible at that . 
  my point is the media propaganda tells germans one thing and greeks another and then we wonder why do greeks all of a sudden hate germans and vice versa . 
  fact is the euro has caused more tensions between states the past few years than anything else . 
  now it 's migrants and guess who is pushing us to keep these unwanted wasters that are straining relations between countries ... the eu of course . 
  it 's just a think gypsy 's and other vagrants do to extort money from people on the street , i 'm saying when it gets to the level of nation states doing it we are better off ignoring them instead of building tensions by helping them but extracting demands . 
  essentially germany will make the rest of the eu hate them and vice versa if things keep going the way the are , we need to go back to just a free trade zone in order to stop rising tensions and ww3 . 
  well i think they would be better off without it so yea if they can they should, 
   not to mention that a return to a nationalist europe would basically guarantee ww3 this century . 
  yea right , we can be europeans without paying for each others bad debts and being forcefully bonded together like those gypsy 's that tie sting round your hands and then tell you to gib moneyz . 
  if anything the euro and eurozone has made me more passive aggressive toward other countries and their policy 's , germany in particular . 
   the easiest scenario for euro disaster is italy disaster ... so i would n't say it 's impossible . 
  yep i 'm hoping to give italy 's debt four or five more years to reach toxic levels and they may end up saving us all from the euro, 
  yep , there is no freaking way i 'm paying taxes to germany to fund their refugee fetish, 
  this is n't about just immigration this is about what concerns eu citizens overall . 
  good job destroying the subreddit !!, 
  thou shall never speak about immigration ever again it seems , no shut up and take your dose of uneducated useless illegals, 
  well if you consider reclaiming land aggression maybe, 
  * catch the train to london , stopping at rejection , disappointment , backstabbing central and shattered dreams parkway . 
  i used to be proud of how finns were always a straight talking people who told it as it is . 
  unfortunately this sjw virus that seems to be infecting from the top down means it 's not ok anymore to point out some ethnicity 's are more likely to commit crime and rape than others . 
  proud of the fact we do n't have any guilt over wars of aggression in the past either although you coudl say we pushed the sami people out but they were simpler times . 
  it 's raining outside now , fuck putin, 
   though the group agreed to pull back from the front lines weeks ago to comply with requirements of february 's minsk ceasefire accord that `` illegal fighting forces '' be withdrawn , its red and black flag still flutters over many locations now manned only by regular troops . 
  thats weird as the last vice dispatch released just a few days ago [ shows them actively fighting on the front lines ] ( https://youtu.be/o_l0mzw4diq?t=7m43s ) `` a few flags '' would be quite the understatement, 
   some of the anarchists managed to hit horses of the mounted police well some of the horses did manage to hit and run over protesters first , when i see someone being trampled by an animal ten times their size i wo n't think twice before giving it the end of my boot .

   some swedes want finland to be more multicultural yea they can fudge right off then, 
  i actually though this was hilarious .

   this is demonstrably false . 
  see how much value the private sector generates if road networks are n't maintained . 
  it is more correct to say the state generates wealth when it manages natural monopolies efficiently . 
  otherwise the private sector does a better job usually . 
  there is no real reason why private sector ca n't build and maintain roads and road networks . 
  for crying out loud , it is usually private companies that make planning , engineering and actual construction of everything . 
  the only thing that public sector does is to tax citizens and companies and re-divert those monies . 
   it is more correct to say the state generates wealth when it manages natural monopolies efficiently . 
  this is the problem . 
  european states are inefficient and bloated . 
  they ca n't handle money responsibly . 
  in north money is spend on oversize bureaucracy and social benefits while in south there are airports where no plane has ever landed and will never land . 
  well , most euro countries actually did that . 
  in central and northern countries social benefits acted as a stabilizer and diverted considerable sums of money to the pockets of people keeping up the consumption . 
  that is why [ german debt to gdp ] ( http://fi.tradingeconomics.com/germany/government-debt-to-gdp ) jumped from 64,9 % in 2009 to 82,5 % in 2011 . 
  i would actually argue that if germany had also launched huge investment projects in 2008/2009 , it would have had a negative effect to the whole global economy as german debt to gdp would have jumped even higher , increasing uncertainty in the market . 
  not to mention that investing into infrastructure only has a point if those investments themselves have a return . 
  spain started a huge amount of investments in 2008/2009 to revive its economy , but what they did was to invest the money in the all wrong places thus deepening spain 's financial crisis . 
  in case of germany , as their infrastructure is already top-notch , it is questionable could the germans in short time found good places to invest . 
  however at the end of the day , it is not the public sector that creates economic growth . 
  economic growth is generated by the private sectors that creates new technologies and invents new way to perform work . 
  the reason growth in europe has lacked is that our political leaders have n't cut down public sector inefficiencies and unneeded legislation that in many countries prevents private sector to grow or renew itself . 
  is it really ? 
  when investing to infrastructure , most of the money is spend on materials , not on wages . 
  not to mention that effect of german or other eurozone countries increasing investments would start to show up at earliest few years from now . 
  actually if we want to get the investment back and make sure we have a good project selection and planning , at earliest projects will start 3-5 years from now . 
   it wo n't be enough alone though . 
  right now the problem is inflation in the euro is too low . 
  the ecb has to commit to seeing its treaty responsibilities of 2 % inflation are met . 
  hugging the lower boundary of 1 % inflation is abuse of the intent of the policy . 
  there is only so much that the ecb can do . 
  responsibility of the central bank should n't be covering or fixing the mistakes of political leaders . 
  yes , that is my estimation too , but i wanted to give him an fair opportunity to prove otherwise . 
  the only thing he would have needed to do is to reply and have a good conversation in finnish language . 
   if you want to cripple a jew , grab him by the throat and hit him in the money . 
   if you want to cripple a jew , grab him by the throat and hit him in the money . 
  this is the first time i have heard that !, 
  from which part of finland do you come and what is your social background ? 
  happy to hear about this experiment and especially about its results . 
  math is really important subject for everybody and thus having children like it more is really important step . 
  on another note , i think that we in europe should do more to learn from each others . 
  our public sectors should actively benchmark each others to find things that others do better and try to ably lesson learned to own working . 
   the community here is very prejudiced against those who are a ) not european and b ) those who are not 100 % behind the confederation of europe into a single country . 
  ** 1 ) ** people who are not european or have not spend considerable time in here are usually just so out of touch that their comments either look ignorant or just plain stupid , thus they get more easily either challenging or negative comments , or just down votes . 
  for example i have heard from brits and other non-europeans that the eurozone will break in ... * 2009 ... 
  did n't happen . 
  did n't happen . 
  did n't happen . 
  did n't happen . 
  did n't happen . 
  not to mention that before that there was the whole debacle of lisbon treaty where the constant rhyme from eurosceptics was ... * it will not be signed * it will not be signed * it will not ratified * it will not be ratified ... * oh , it was ratified , but anyways the eu will break up next year ... * at least the year after that * if not year after that then the next year . 
  you catch my drift ? 
  ** 2 ** ) god damn it !, 
  european union is not confederation of europe that is trying to form a single country . 
  eu is already a * de facto * federation that is on path of becoming * de jure * federation in the future . 
  becoming a single country is not on agenda . 
  single country meaning that we all have the same governmental institutions and systems instead of having different institutions and systems per state . 
  what the federalization of europe means is that in some cases we transfer functionality to european level ( currency ) and in some cases we share the same legislation ( directives ) , and in some cases we have our own way of doing things ( welfare ) . 
  ** question , what were you thinking when you wrote this tirade ? 
  what did you think that you would achieve by doing it ? 
   now , you may make claims about `` efficiency '' and `` productivity '' which are diplomatic ways of explaining how `` northerners '' are superior , by pointing at stuff like luxury cars and heavy machinery . . but you still are n't explaining how a mcdonalds worker `` in the north '' has a much better deal than a mcdonalds worker `` in the south '' . 
  i assure you they are not doing anything different , better or `` superior '' . 
  the reason why mcdonalds worker for example in finland makes more money than for example in cyprus is because the rest of the economy produces more , thus making it possible to pay workers more without making the price of hamburgers unfordable to the target market . 
  if southern economies would be producing more high value products and services , then there would be more purchasing power in the economy to enable higher wages wages even in low value producing sectors of the economy . 
   . . now you come along and tell us that we 're competing with china ? 
  no thanks , mate . 
  i 'd rather we just became protectionist if that 's really what 's going on . 
  i doubt anybody here is looking forward to becoming an expendable $ 300/month slave in some factory -- but if that 's really what is going on , then the `` north '' has way more to fall than the `` south '' . 
  the problem with protectionism is that at the end of the day , you need imports and the only way to pay for them is with exports . 
  the more you produce and the more high value products and services you export , the more you can import . 
  of course you can try to substitute imports as much as possible , but oil , gas and commodities that are not available are not available . 
  in case of high-tech and high-spec products , either they are ridiculously expensive to produce or just impossible to produce . 
   what it starts sounding like , to me , is that `` the north '' wants to create a new `` china '' in the `` south '' -- one that they control economically . 
  otherwise , how do you explain the lack of `` reform '' in the `` north '' ? 
  you were the china before china already . 
  for example in finland our textile and clothing industries died long time ago . 
  now what happened during the last decade is that production moved even more farther away . 
  the only way to respond to this change is to enable the economy to reinvent itself . 
   then you sit down and analyze what kind of `` reforms '' are being pushed through : selling government assets at discounted rates due to desperation [ handing monopolies over to multinational monopolies ] , making it easier for banks to seize your assets , making it easier for your employer to fire you , removing various other work-related rights , cutting your wages ( which were n't even that high to start with ) etc. . 
  while in the scope of an individual , for example making it easier for employers to fire people might be very negative in short term , what it enables in long term is better and more effective resource allocation which again in long term will lead to higher productivity that makes it possible to have higher wages and more jobs . 
  or for example in portugal there has been strict rent controls that has lead to a situation where huge amount of lisbon 's housing is in a state of ruins . 
  if there would have not been rent controls , then the owners would have taken better care of the properties and there would have been additional investment to new housing . 
  another example could be too strict protections for renters in spain , which again has lead to a situation where nobody wants to invest on rent housing , thus leading to a situation where there are n't enough rentable properties which itself has many consequences , one of them of decreased worker mobility . 
   btw , you have my condolences on your country 's economy . 
  i 'm sure you can explain to me the external factors involved in this just as well as i can explain the external factors in my country 's case too . 
  the problem of our economy is that it is not growing , however our gdp per capita ( nominal ) is still one of the highest in the world , so at the moment we do n't have a problem . 
  in case of why it is not growing , it is all due to our own fault . 
  the fault largely lies on our legislation and taxation that curbs companies from growing !, 
  can you imagine that for example taxation of dividends is lower for companies not listed in the stock exchange !, 
  another huge problem is that our public sector is too heavy and demands too much money , thus leaving the private sector on too low fire . 
  all these things are things that we can fix , however to this day we have n't have had enough political will to just fi them . 
   long story short , geography does n't come into this . 
  we made some very bad decisions with how the eurozone works . 
  the ship started sinking , `` northern countries '' were slightly more prepared because they had the top floor , but they 're still standing on a sinking boat ... sinking with the rest of us  well that is defeatist attitude . 
  the thing is that global markets are growing and fast . 
  europe is highly developed , highly educated and highly innovative , if we just let the markets act free , we can make our companies and economy to grow !, 
   i believe it 's better for my family 's future to not be part of the same currency union as germany with the hostile attitude they have towards their `` allies '' . 
  how on earth can you equate demands to reform on being hostile ? 
  the fact of the matter is that developing economies such as china & co. are increasing world wide competition and quickly . 
  already this increase of competition has pushed southern producers from markets that they used to dominate .

  including the guy the size of a house queuing for his seventh big mac of the day . 
  including the guy who had trouble finishing a sprint in gym class as he was clumsy enough to forget which foot to put forward which . 
  that 's way too short a time to undo a lifetime of bad health choices and lack of exercise . 
  you literally ca n't even get all of the conscripts to a decent fitness level if they are completely out of shape when they enter the ranks . 
  in that reality , where a part ( altough a relatively small part ) of the conscripts are actually relieved from service altogether because they are n't fit enough to go through it , it would definitely help to have women available to fill the ranks . 
  if we had the fitter and better suited portion of women conscripted instead of the poorly doing men unable to train properly , the overall quality of the force would be better . 
   i read somewhere that the average man is about as strong and usually stronger than best world class female athletes . 
  i find that really hard to believe but i do n't have a way to find out for sure . 
  either way , strength is n't the only or even the most important factor to be able to perform the duties . 
  for example , i bet a 170cm/130kg guy would be a lot stronger than a 170cm/60kg woman , but would be unable to continue after trying to run a set of stairs while the woman would n't even be affected . 
  for most things the absolute strength is n't very important . 
  being _ strong enough _ , generally fit and in good health is enough . 
  considering that we have an army of conscripts serving between 6 and 12 months , you ca n't expect them to be in as good a shape physically as professional soldiers . 
  the people come in all shapes and sizes , i remember a good bunch of guys who were at least 30kg overweight even at the end of the year , and those were the kind that were deemed fit enough to even begin the military service . 
  theoretically , with proper training and lifestyle choices etc. , most men would be probably capable of being a lot more suitable for soldiers physically . 
  in reality , we have 5.5 million men , women and children . 
  some too young , too old , too fat , too weak , with disabilities etc. 
  if we could double the pool of people we choose the conscripts from , we would get a lot more strong _ enough _ and fit _ enough _ people to serve instead of the barely capable ( for various reasons ) men , on top of the women who are actually better fits for fighting than most men are . 
  not to mention all the other talent we 're `` wasting '' by only using half the population to help defend the country . 
  women are just as capable of being skilled engineers , doctors , strategists etc. 
  specialists that are needed in an army . 
   its really not worth it to try to do anything more than make it an option to try out for any woman that thinks she can meet the standard . 
  and even then , many other challenges arise with women in all male combat groups . 
  there are women serving in finland as volunteers already . 
  when i served my bit a decade ago there did n't seem to be any issues women in combat groups . 
  there was n't women in my unit continuously but we had women with us for a few longer training missions for a few weeks at a time and had no problems . 
  what kind of problems you mean , i ca n't think of any ? 
  women were housed in their own room while in the barracks but that 's about the only difference i can think of . 
  ** tl ; dr : ** average man is probably stronger than an average woman . 
  variation within the groups is larger than the difference between them . 
  obviously the standards are set depending on the role . 
  i would n't care if my crew had balls or not , i 'd care if they could carry their loads or help me get to cover if needed . 
  it 's okay . 
  we do n't mind , really . 
  yes , you kind of know that . 
  that 's why i said there probably wo n't be many donors when they put the idea to motion . 
  did n't you catch that the first time i said it ? 
  what ? 
  i 'm talking about suddenly gaining the responsibility of being a father to a stranger , not a drop of sperm . 
  would you be cool about one day , 20 years from now , having someone , or 10 someones , walk to your door and informing you that they 're your kids ? 
  would your wife you 've been married to for a decade like that ? 
  what about your kids ? 
  yeah , i guess that leaves around 1 % who would n't mind . 
  do you really think that would n't be an issue ? 
  that only gets rid of all the donors . 
  sounds like a great plan . 
  until recently the headline was there to give as much information from the article at a glance , not make you read the article . 
  do you really need to ask how mentioning reasons why dubs are sometimes a bad idea is relevant to a discussion about whether they 're a good idea ? 
  come on now , you 're not that dumb , i 'm sure you can figure that one out . 
  it 's pretty obvious that they can be better . 
  did someone disagree ? 
  i did n't say that , you did . 
  it 's impossible to do it as well as the original in some circumstances . 
  that 's just a fact . 
   it 's animation , dubs work perfectly fine there . 
  anime is not on another level than disney movies , it 's the same medium and dubs work perfectly fine for it . 
  live-action is where the issue is . 
  theoretically it 's fine . 
  in practice , a lot of dubs are of lower quality than the original voice acting and possibly has stuff lost in translation . 
  i guess that 's probably less of an issue if you 're using french dubbing but for a small language like finnish the quality is often poor enough to make it unusable . 
  wait , how does the dubbing cover his face ? 
  these days they do . 
  i was n't so lucky back in the day . 
  i was pretty furious for having to take a year off from work and straight up pay them for the privilege ... 
  also most people ca n't get one of those and have to get an apartment from the private sector . 
  suddenly the prices start probably somewhere around 700 $ . 
  you can still have strong ties and help each other while living in different addresses . 
  i do n't see the connection between the two things . 
  i do understand that housing might be relatively expensive and it seems like a reasonable accommodation in that case . 
  it 's probably because it does n't ruin your lungs like cigarettes . 
  it 's quite popular in general as well , at least in helsinki ( and i 'd guess in other places with easy and cheap access to sweden as well ) . 
   it is only legal in sweden within eu . 
  sweden is the only eu country where it 's legal to _ sell _ snus . 
  over here it 's surprisingly commonly used for something that you 're not legally able to buy without leaving the country . 
  when i played hockey back in the day , probably half the guys used snus . 
  maybe you do . 
  op definitely does n't . 
  that was the point , not your view about the eu . 
  the thing is that the vote leaves us no choice in the matter . 
  we obviously ca n't give you as good a deal as you had . 
  everything you 'll get will be worse in comparison to what you had . 
  that 's not us wanting to punish you , that 's what the british public forced britain and eu to do by voting to leave . 
  it 's like watching someone jump in front of a train , we surely would n't want to be them but he jumped there himself and we ca n't grab him away anymore . 
  that 's natural for them , and other peoples away on the outskirts . 
  i guess it 's not natural to see it that way when you 're in the heart of europe but we also refer to basically the whole of western , central and southern europe and all the countries in there as `` europe '' and we `` go to europe '' for a vacation . 
  it 's not necessarily about us vs them or not wanting to be a part of a european community , is simply how things seem when you 're somewhat on the outside . 
  the brits in their isles and we here in the north with a sea between us and everything . 
  around 2dl per cup would be normal . 
  it 's not espresso strong , though . 
  closer to americano but i do n't think that 's a very good description either . 
  there is nothing wrong with the beans , they 're often great albeit generally a light roast . 
  it 's the brewing part that often needs a lot of work . 
  you can make excellent coffee with finnish beans . 
  that would essentially make / r/europe / r/russia . 
  i 'm not sure that 's the direction we want to take . 
  i ca n't comment on other countries but at least for finland it 's still accurate . 
  yes , we do have two official languages , but the finnish speakers need to learn swedish , the other official yet foreign to them language , and the swedish speakers vice versa . 
  the thing is , we have a small swedish people 's party hovering around 5 % support and , as you might guess from the name , concentrates mostly on keeping the language situation as it is in the country . 
  their support is only around 5 % in all the elections but they are basically willing to support any coalition as long as the coalition does n't touch swedish , so they 're often an easy party to work with for more popular parties in need of a coalition partner . 
  due to being basically the easiest partner ever , they were in the cabinet 16 consecutive times from mid 70s until last year when the current cabinet was formed , in coalition with left , right or centrist parties .

  hell copy the us one . 
  the powers of this federation should be limited so that each state has the power to not implement federal laws that it 's population does not support and that are outside of the boundaries of the constitution . 
  do that , and there is a chance for an european federation . 
  but if you even think of limiting the power of the people it will never happen . 
   the anti-eu crowd do n't even need to do anything to destroy the union , the pro-eu crowd is doing a good enough job themselves . 
  exactly !, 
  it is n't rocket science what the people want . 
  it has never been . 
  but instead of listening to the people they went ahead with stupid ass decisions time and time again and now they wonder why some voters went from pro-eu to against the eu . 
  i 'm one of them . 
  if you 'd asked me six or seven years ago i 'd been very much an eu supporter . 
  now i 'm the polar opposite . 
  i just can not see this union work again , its gone too far the wrong way to be saved in my opinion and it 's sad . 
  we truly had a good thing going for a while but these bureaucrats took that away from us . 
  but then again an institution that evolved from trade to a super governmental organisation with a parliament that can not propose laws and an undemocratically elected commission that can propose laws was inherently flawed and once again shows that an undemocratic system can not survive . 
  ever . 
  look at the swiss , the reason they have had peace and prosperity for ages is because of their truly democratic system that does not allow as much room for corrupt bought officials that see to their own interests rather than the peoples interests . 
  man i wish i 'd been born in switzerland so that i could sit and watch this circus go on from the sidelines . 
  i know . 
  that 's why you only buy quality sausage . 
  dam that sounded dirty ... anyhow ... only buy quality sausages people . 
  now as we are in the eu , i 'd wish that the eu decided to put , especially , the us copyright mob in their place and send them packing . 
  i do understand the importance of protecting intellectual property to some degree , but that `` some degree '' went out the window a long fucking time ago . 
  for books and music i could live with the fact that the artist holds the rights as long as he lives . 
  but if he sells or transfers the rights to a corporation they should only be protected a maximum of 20 years . 
  take disney , they are hunting people for piracy , they 've built their whole company on copying old works and remaking them . 
  hollywood itself was built through the breach of patents and intellectual property . 
  the sole reason to why the movie companies re-located to california and created what became the hollywood of today was because it was far away from new jersey , which made it harder for edison 's motion picture patents company to hunt them down . 
  and now they have the balls to come after some kid who downloaded a move that most likely was shit anyways . 
  more info [ here ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/motion_picture_patents_company#backlash_and_decline ) and [ here ] ( http://www.history.com/news/the-renegade-roots-of-hollywood-studios ) the us has completely been hijacked by corporations and if the eu want to become more liked across the board it should take a stronger position in matters like this which are closer to the heart of common people . 
  priceless :d, 
  i think i need to give / r/anarcho _ capitalism a try then . 
  there was once this anarco capitalism debate in helsinki i went to and it was actually good . 
  they knew what they were talking about and admitted their limitations of what was true , not true or unknown . 
  now let us sit back and enjoy the downvotes that will soon land upon us . 
  this is a damn hippie sub . 
  it 's like a little ant-hill that you go an poke with a stick and all these leftist and pro-eu liberals will run around like crazy screaming nazi , fascist , storm-front etc. 
  it 's genuinely fun though . 
  it 's not often you find big pool of these easily offended people to play with . 
  for each comment made here there are one or two things that you can say and all hell will break loose , and they 're too blinded by anger to understand that when they get pissed , their ability to argue the point disappears . 
  what you are left with is the true mental capability of them to debate outside of their comfort zone of opinions . 
  which is very limited to start with , and once they realise that , they 'll resort to bringing out the hitler cards at which point the debate stops . 
  all while they think they won , but poking just a little bit more will result in an epic display of a debate decomposing to a sinkhole of nothingness . 
  this sub is even more one sided than / r/debatecommunism where you at times can see really balanced debates . 
  the `` meat '' is mainly rest products of other meat produce with fat and salt tying it together . 
  it 's no secret that it is n't the healthiest stuff out there . 
  but it sure is tasty . 
  well he has said the same thing during the european parliamentary elections . 
  if the finns want a referendum they should have it . 
  nothing new about that . 
  from their party program :  the finns party believes there should be a referendum on finland 's eu membership in a similar way to what the uk government has proposed -- first negotiations on the basic eu constitution and membership conditions and then referendums held on whether to be a member of the reformed eu or not . 
  very well placed argument there . 
  my party ? 
  i 've always voted for kokoomus . 
  soini has said that if the people want a referendum they want to give the finns that . 
  the rest of your comment is just a pointless rant . 
   or serbian oh man you really are a complete new level of moron . 
  good for you . 
  i tagged you as a moron . 
  as a whole industry in sweden yes . 
   you are a lying sack of fucking dog turd . 
  oh you . 
  you are so childish it almost makes it fun to keep you around just to piss you off . 
  the guy truly has a few nuts loose . 
  do n't waste your time on him . 
   you can backpedal all you want , but you 're a violent , sociopathic , neonazi . 
  oh ok . well then i guess i can say that you are a pacifistic , leftist pedophile . 
  as anything can be said here without any actual logic . 
  oh here you are . 
  now looking at what you are trying to concoct here you once again are talking out of your ass . 
  you asked if i was prepared to shoot and i said yes . 
  i never said that i 'd shoot them but at them . 
  but if you want to know . 
  like / u/merkelsclitoris is saying nowhere did i mention anything about shooting them i said that i 'd have no problems shooting . 
  but to settle this for once so that you can take another pathetic screenshot . 
  if it was my duty to stop that boat no matter what i would do so if asked . 
  furthermore as i 've said before , i want these illegal immigration boats to stop putting peoples lives in danger on the seas and nothing else seems to work . 
  you sure are hung up on one issue where i 've told countless times what my stand is . 
  how that makes me a racist is beyond me but you clearly think so . 
  but then again you are a sorry excuse to expect any logic from . 
  i am not backtracking i am saying as it is . 
  i said shoot at the boats and nothing more too it . 
  what is the big issue you have with that ? 
  these people are coming here through illegal means organised by criminals and you have an issue with wanting to stop that from happening . 
  oh god i can not stand people like you . 
  seriously just go hide under the rock from where you crawled out underneath . 
  i never said filth i said junk as a response to a question where one user wanted the other to clarify what he meant . 
  as i posted it i can still see it and nowhere does it say filth nor was it stating my opinion either . 
  so once again you are talking out of your ass . 
   you were being a racist fucking lying shit . 
  i do n't need to lie . 
  i am open as a book . 
  what do you want to know about my opinions ? 
  i 'll tell them to you . 
  you do n't even seem to comprehend what racism is . 
   i 'm not a ` leftist ' or ` socialist ' either dude you 're so far on the left that it sickens most people . 
  this whole political correctness bs and calling people racist , storm front , fascist thing you have going on is enough proof of that . 
   you once told me you do n't delete you old comments . 
  funny then , that you have so many deleted comments on matters of race , ethnicity , and immigration , comments which were deleted by the mods for breaching the rules about racism . 
  first of all the rules here on what constitutes racism are moronic .

  ( i understand it can be used for other departures , as well . ), 
  edit : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/see_a_man_about_a_dog, 
  you have nice shoes . 
  heh , that sounds pretty much like in finland . 
  a few women i know now insist on cheek kissing ( how many ? 
  two or three ? 
  apparently the swiss and the dutch do three ... ) or that fake `` air kissing '' . 
  i 'm perpetually clueless about these things . 
  manner !, 
  any particular points that were more confusing than others ? 
  another one : ** kuha on : ** pyydyst\u00e4 kuha . 
  although the site is produced by * the finland promotion board * , i thought that the piece was rather well written and accurate , imo . 
  have something similar from denmark ? 
  ha , we have a similar one in finnish : * `` jos t\u00e4dill\u00e4 olis munat , se olis set\u00e4 . 
  '' * which translates to : * `` if aunt had balls she would be uncle . 
  many thanks !, 
  `` the owls are not what they seem . '', 
  is there really a greek saying that translates to ; * `` there is trouble in the gypsy village '' * , meaning * `` i do n't care '' / `` nobody cares '' * ? 
  saw this once on tv ( qi ) and it left me wondering if it 's true . 
  cheers !, 
  ah , seems that you got the basics right !, 
  i have n't been to latvia yet , what would be the similar things to know about latvia ? 
  finland . 
  ( nobody would feel finland an easy country to assimilate to . 
  i just typed that for finns who like to ctrl-f their own country in / r/europe posts . ), 
  yeah , a good idea . 
  that 's where most of them are holed up . 
  i wonder if it was [ ian ] ( http://youtu.be/olpqmw2xjmc?t=13m18s ) ? 
  i got it : `` my hovercraft if full of eels . '', 
  that 's a good idea !, 
  actually the irish have already asked about the bear . 
  there are few of them in helsinki . 
  ah , i have n't had the pleasure yet . 
  i wish we had an enormous bear that would hunt and kill ( only ) those busybodies in our government and ministries who introduce and impose petty rules and bans upon our people . 
  * run you you fucking soulless meddlers , here comes the bear !, 
  me too . 
  perhaps you are right . 
  but if we are talking about weapons grade fish , i think that the swedes win with their [ surstr\u00f6mming ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/surstr%c3%b6mming ) . 
  their * [ brunost ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-21141244 ) * is a wmd . 
  it also tastes bad . 
  and it 's not technically even cheese . 
  ah , typical . 
  we are lead by the least among us . 
   good on sweden for actually having morals , while my own country just ca n't wait to participate in another war with our friends overseas , without un-mandate . 
  holy fuck , really ? 
  oh , i agree with your much more insightful comment . 
  it 's not like elop took over a healthy company , nokia was already in nosedive , riddled with bad software decisions - or what some might call -- indecision . 
   i 'm not a huge fan of our finnish one , i must say . 
  we should change it to sibelius ' finlandia instead . 
  i agree !, 
  me too . 
  many finns smelled a ~ ~ rat ~ ~ mole when stephen elop ( formerly of microsoft ) was chosen as the new ceo . 
  many thought he was sent on a mission to acquire nokia mobiles for microsoft . 
  it appears that they were right . 
  about the elk/moose - dilemma : http://www.thelocal.se/48736/20130627/, 
  it 's a mistranslation , i think . 
  finnish name for a deep cooking dish is * kattila * . 
  it appears that we got the word from a germanic language :  the word kettle originates from old norse ketill `` cauldron '' . 
  the old english spelling was \u010betel with initial che - [ t\u0283 ] like ` cherry ' , middle english ( and dialectal ) was chetel , both come ( together with german kessel `` cauldron '' ) ultimately from germanic * katilaz , that was borrowed from latin catillus , diminutive form of cat\u012bnus `` deep vessel for serving or cooking food '' , [ 2 ] which in various contexts is translated as `` bowl '' , `` deep dish '' , or `` funnel '' . 
  the photog said that she left the ~ ~ kettle ~ ~ pot , but did find a small picture frame . 
  here 's a brit/german relay joke : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48aumxifan8 ( i know i play this game wrong . ), 
  apparently we do have one , although it 's an inland fjord and thus nothing like norway 's fjords . 
  yeah , they treat these letters as * r\u00f6ck d\u00f6ts * . 
  two consecutive different vowels is a challenge for many anglophones ; `` tolkein '' , `` herion '' etc. 
   sorry to let you down , but i am not british . 
  ah , i wonder where i got that idea . 
  i do n't know if that 's standard finnish humor , perhaps a bit more on the retarded side . 
  i have great respect for british humour and i regularly follow several brit programs and i 'm absolutely hooked on your comedy panel shows . 
  what i think we do have in common , is the understatement and self-deprecation . 
  but we also have a heritage of eastern love for misery and suffering in a slow motion . 
  example : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nuyfg9xopkk, 
  dolan , too !, 
  oh , get a room , you two . 
  thanks for the links . 
  seems that part of the finnish * sisu * could have been generated by smack or speed . 
  [ the finnish dragoons will assist . 
  i thought as much . 
  very clever . 
  cheers . 
  we are led by the least among us . 
  ( is this analogous to eli5 ? ), 
  thanks . 
  i genuinely did n't get it . 
  but did he do it on porpoise ? 
  he tried * what * ? 
  yea , you pretty much got it . 
  i think . 
  my swedish is not too good . 
  '' ... i would like to go to the lobby bar . '', 
  i meant `` civil servant '' being her name as in : `` hej , jag heter cybill shepherd , och jag skulle vilja g\u00e5 till lobbybaren '', 
  yeah , it 's true in theory , but in practice people who have passed the `` swedish for civil servants '' - exam , may not be able to say much more than : * `` hej , jag heter civil servant '' * . 
  but i agree , it was nice that [ olli ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/olli_rehn ) said it in both official languages . 
  heh , yes , the lesser known alkie moomin . 
  we better ask this noone fella , then . 
  i noticed there 's an explanation of this elk/moose conundrum at the bottom of the page : http://www.thelocal.se/48736/20130627/, 
  thanks !, 
  well , the sheep in this story were used to more loving encounters . 
  encounters apparently so frequent that they had been conditioned to the sound of a zipper . 
  heh , have you ever tried to drown a man made of cork ? 
  it was an attempt at humor .

no eu trade agreement will ever lower our level of protection of consumers , or food safety , or of the environment . 
  that 's quite a promise . 
   these ` poor people ' were forced to pay for the hospitality of the danish government were they ? 
  i remember that they would get their money back with some conditions ? 
  why does n't germany keep all of the migrants , since it 's you who want them ? 
  us others could help them in refugee camps . 
  it 's not about 500 people . 
  it 's more about giving the power to allocate migrants to commission . 
  when you give it , it 's very difficult to get it back . 
   and you are actually helping people in need give me a break . 
  what % of the iraqis and afganis do you think are really in need ? 
  like they are persecuted and could n't live a normal life in their country ? 
  in some other countries , whose banks were not bailed out , it was n't well known , until much later . 
  the banks should have given up something for the tax payers , like shares in the banks . 
  or something else . 
  but what did they give in response for a very large bailout ? 
  they do n't represent the european tax payer , it seems . 
  why do they wonder if denmark * specifically * sucks ? 
  they ai n't bad . 
  some software company should take this kid under their wing . 
  come on guys , give humor credit to germans when it 's due . 
  r/europe is too small for former empires / s, 
  i do n't remember that discussion . 
  i was under 20 . 
  what comes to your other points , the immigration of the current kind is against interests of many european countries . 
  in fact it is hard to come by countries that benefit from it , as is . 
  but a bit of a dick . 
  you 're partly right , but if there would n't be that many mena-immigrants , we would n't have to cut as much right now . 
  it feels insanity . 
  i do n't know if the current politicians are willing or able to do that . 
  at least in finland . 
  quite a few people do n't want riots in their countries . 
  the asylum seekers should be processed somewhere outside europe . 
  some unelected dimwit or idealist , who does n't care about our budgets or taxes . 
  it 's a huuuuuge show , with drama , comedy and cringe comedy . 
  so just like european elections , the show 's just bigger and more dramatic . 
  there are a lot of good points in what you say . 
  there should be a better concept of what should be done in eu level , and how it could be done fairly and effectively . 
  the hypocrite part has been true for a big part of eu politicians , in various countries . 
  but this kind of dumb ideas can mould eu more back towards the free trade area . 
  right , most people wanted to join the free trade area . 
  this crisis and some other problems were not in people 's radar in any way . 
   35 % of imigrants living in sweden longer then 15 years have job when reading this kind of stats , it 's important to notice if all immigrants are counted . 
  the employment is much higher for immigrants from neighbouring countries , for instance . 
  so how low is the employment level for mena immigrants , where the immigrants are coming at the moment ? 
   then send them home once things are ok finland has trouble sending back even convicted people who have got deportation order . 
  imagine going through this for 20 000 people , for instance . 
  with this mess , almost nothing seems to be easy . 
  important question is , do they still have 6 kids each ? 
  i 've been told that the average numbers have gone down , but i 'm too lazy to go find european stats . 
  you want to pay those future checks ? 
  we have quite large budget deficit this year , too . 
  what part of finnish welfare do you want to cut for the immigrants , who are not paying for themselves quickly ? 
  `` reputation of our country '' , oh come on . 
   several groups of iraqis took the first plane to baghdad . 
  that makes one quite a bit more doubtful of the dire situation that the asylum seekers have in their countries . 
  police special force unit should raid yle premises . 
  could be entertaining if they 'd send live feed of it . 
  the end sum is probably very hard to assess . 
  my god , it 's devil 's work !, 
  i guess for some governments they are migrant workers , masked as refugees . 
  because kosher-rules are not `` european values '' , the kosher eaters can demand food companies to mark kosher food . 
  many large factories do run at night . 
  they are big energy users . 
   electrolysis + sabatier reaction to create methane , we can use all the excess electricity to convert co2 from the air to methane and pump it into the natural gas network . 
  i guess so , but the yields and costs are not at satisfactory level quite yet ? 
  i 'll have a look , thanks . 
  if all of the adults in your hometown are responsible , i congratulate you folks . 
  in mine , there are certainly some unstable individuals , and hopefully they do n't have a handgun . 
  hunters have hunting rifles , i assume , which are more difficult to carry around . 
  but it 's a cultural issue with the mass shootings , in my mind . 
  some 3 letter agency just collects all toddlers to a state institution . 
  i think trump loves the company of trump . 
  it might sound conspiratorial , but people and companies typically do things that enhance their careers and bring them money . 
  and if they get caught in criminal or fraudulent activities , like some banks and credit raters , they get a slap on the wrist and the individuals keep their bonuses . 
  i 'm pretty cynical about politicians and big business , i admit . 
  it 's their job to prove the consumers ' worries wrong . 
   often gmo products are chemically indistinguishable from non-gmo . 
  but sometimes they are . 
  and quite a few people would at least want to know , when the products are genetically modified . 
  when the contractors are paid , possibly a lot , it tends to affect their independence . 
  they want to get paid again , right ? 
   it should stay at levels where it can be repaid and where the interest does not eat you up well , when does a country reach this point ? 
  some countries are quite in debt . 
   progressive vikings this is the next tv-hit , after `` the vikings '' . 
  the unions and the government are not doing the addressing very well . 
  well , the swedish journalists might write what they like , as long as it 's accepted by their employer , bonnier . 
  ( well , only half of them really ), 
  if you 're a guy processing migrants , and you have to do hundreds of decisions , how do you make sure who is economic migrant and who is not ? 
  many of the economic ones are being prepped by smugglers to tell believable stories . 
  yours did , but mine maybe did n't . 
  many european politicians , important ones too , have complained about returning the boats . 
  i want to see people returned too , but it just does n't seem to be happening . 
  we could think that there is one tier of human rights , the inalienable ones , and then other tiers . 
  so that we do n't have to eat the whole thing that the old farts cooked up decades ago . 
  the immigrants often vote for leftist parties , which her party is not . 
  but it 's a thought that now they might think of the party as a `` saviour '' . 
  so maybe it was something more than a good luck emblem for him ? 
  anyway , swastika is an old symbol , used in some societies still . 
  we should get together , and use the trading as a bargaining chip for them to take illegals back .

   do video games receive government money ? 
  well , uk promised tax cuts last year , but ec was against them . 
  [ apparently same rules govern that as film industry ] ( http://www.mcvuk.com/news/read/uk-game-tax-breaks-in-doubt-as-european-commission-launches-investigation/0114159 ) . 
  to get money , ec thinks , you have to make games that are culturally unique , not `` global '' ( eg . 
  aping americans ) . 
   the `` culture '' problem europe has is that we only look at the past . 
  if its not like it was 50 years ago , then its not `` european culture '' . 
  every new idea is labeled `` american '' and vilified . 
  do our films look only in the past ? 
  there are no european films set in the present or future , is what you 're saying ? 
  but let me tell you this ; if you are making a video game that could take place anywhere , and you decide to put it in new york , you are n't really interesting in drawing from european culture ( or adding to it ) -- but instead from and to american . 
  can you argue against this ? 
   we need more open minds and more confidence in european creativity . 
  we should create new stuff , not just long for the past . 
  and how exactly making it harder to create new stuff is going to help in this ? 
   you say that as if it was a good thing , everybody is a little poorer to subsidise films nobody cares about and that 's good somehow because it was made here ? 
  first ; little poorer . 
  film industry brings a lot of jobs , directly and indirectly . 
  if tax money is put into production that takes place inside the home borders , all the money will return back to the state coffers in few months . 
  on the way they employ a lot of people and may even bring money from outside the state . 
  second ; subsiding films nobody wants to see . 
  usually people are interested in seeing films made at home . 
  but not all are n't . 
  and when you target only certain audience , there 's of course a risk -- which hollywood does n't share . 
  you 're saying that because a light-weight pugilist and heavy-weight pugilist are both best-of-the-line and both are doping-free , then the fight is fair . 
   so you 're going to make it more difficult to watch us films because you do n't like them ? 
  have you had any problems seeing us-films wherever you live ? 
  i 'm going to guess no . 
  the idea of the government aid is n't to ban us-films , it 's to give local films the same subjective aid that hollywood-films enjoy due to larger target group . 
   there 's not being a protectionist and an authoritarian and allow people to choose for themselves what they want to watch regardless of its origin . 
  i 'm slowly starting to get the impression that you have no idea how film industry or economy works . 
   you do n't have to worry about that , if it 's low quality , there wo n't be watched by many people anyway . 
  buying those packets from usa is cheaper than producing your own shows . 
  so they put game of thrones/walking dead/whatever on prime-time and put garage wars/whatever to fill the less popular spots . 
  that way they can get the low-hanging fruits , try to do some additional fishing on the low-periods and not contribute anything to the local culture ( after all , why put a lot of money on a local show that might flop , instead of buying a sure hit like got , which packet costs about the same amount ) . 
   we do n't want or need anyone from the eu ( or anywhere ) saying . . who do you think makes the decisions to buy those packets at tv-stations ? 
  the same people also decide if they want to commission their own shows . 
  if you want to run a tv-station , you have to have somebody saying this stuff !, 
  the point of the directives is to stop them from going with certain choices to their logical conclusion . 
  anyway . 
  every industry needs regulation . 
   if they could only stop regulating everything and let the citizens of europe decide for themselves , things would n't be slowly getting worse for us all . 
  name a decade during which you think television was better than it 's now and explain why . 
   yup , though it 's nothing new , if the eu supports free-trade . . 
  in case you forgot , eu being a free-trade area is it 's raison d'\u00eatre . 
  yeah , nobody has ever heard of ameli\u00e9 , the fifth element , l\u00e9on , persepolis . . 
   then do n't eat and do n't watch those things . 
  you kind of need alternatives . 
  let 's use films as an example . 
  let 's say that you need 2 million viewers to break even . 
  you calculate that there are maybe three million people interested in this film , so you can probably break even , if you get all the three million , you make moderate winnings and can go to make the next film . 
  the day your film is coming to theatres , similar us-film also launched . 
  it also needed two million people to break even , but thanks to larger markets it has already gotten 50 million around usa and eu . 
  but it robs you that one million ( people only go to films that often , and they do n't always choose the home-made version ) ; you can only break even . 
  you note that all the films you are interested in doing have similar films in the us pipeline . 
  you figure that 2 million is now your best figure . 
  and you can only break even . 
  sure , you can cut the budget , but it does n't help that much and it would show in reviews , essentially making this a plus/minus-thing . 
  this is where most eu-governments step in and help fund the next film enough that that 2 million-viewers can be seen as `` moderate winnings '' . 
  this is what france fears is getting banned . 
  `` do n't go watch us films '' is n't going to help . 
  they 're on the market . 
  they 're going to cut on the market share , no matter what . 
  without intervention , we only get those `` captain murica viii '' - type films . 
  there 's nothing to choose from . 
   that 's retarded , if you want to watch european made content , fine , do n't ruin it for the rest of us who rather watch american stuff . 
  this is protectionism but with regards to tv programming . 
  i did n't say i was against american programming . 
  i said i was against increasing the amount of american programming of low quality . 
  the thing about selling tv-shows is that they are n't sold per-show but by per-packet . 
  each packet has a great show like game of thrones , breaking bad etc. 
  on it plus stuff like garage wars and whatnot . 
  so after shelling money to get stuff that should be shown , they have a lot of `` free '' stuff that should n't be shown . 
  that 's why eu has directives about how big a percentile of programming must originate from eu . 
  directives such as this are undoubtedly against free-trade agreement . 
  the millenium-trilogy is a great example . 
  if something does escape `` the language ghetto '' , hollywood will make sure it will be soon forgotten . 
   iron sky had a pan-european budget . 
  ok , so i straightened some corners , but still ; ( 1 . ), 
  eight million is n't much . 
  it was in english and ( 3 . ), 
  set in nyc . 
  the only european value i could think of was how negatively it saw the american culture . 
   yes , but other areas where we and indeed the rest of the eu could gain are being held hostage on a french whim . 
  imagine the outcry if the uk had done the same for something . 
  it 's not just french who fund their own film industry . 
  germans tax incentives and uwe boll should be known to all of us . 
  north european countries have all sort of generous grands . 
  probably the rest of eu as well . 
  these are important to make films that will probably never gain popularity outside the smallish home markets . 
  britain is n't on this boat , as you have big markets not just in america and ireland but in the rest of eu as well . 
  top gear and doc who and what not . 
  but the rest of eu ca n't say the same . 
  we can get the jokes , we can understand the language ( or have it subtitled ) -- but you would never watch german scifi-series , no matter how good production values , plot etc. 
  it would have . 
   we need to build up an industry that finds ways to make european culture more appealing to the average person , inside and outside of europe . 
  we can never compete with big budgets . 
  not even french can , and their government spends money on that like crazy . 
  in finland , the biggest budget ever was iron sky with something like 8 million euros . 
  most films are done with 2 .

   because of its exceptionally rich noun case system , whereby nouns take on different suffixes based on their place in a sentence . 
  for example here 's [ the 2,253 different word-forms of the finnish noun kauppa ( * shop * ) . 
  ] ( http://www.ling.helsinki.fi/~fkarlsso/genkau2.html ) tbf many of them are rarely if ever used but they 're all grammatically correct and do have their meanings and/or nyances . 
  yet in one short lesson with only two simple words you have just learned to say eight different things in finnish . 
   edit will you listen to the economist ? 
  then read this interesting article comparing finland and sweden . 
  hold your horses . 
  that article does not provide any analysis that finland 's problems were due to euro . 
  instead it lists various reasons such as : * changes in global markets * loss of competitiveness as unit labour costs have shot up by 20 % in the past five years * need to improve public-service productivity which is pretty much what anyone familiar with relevant economic indicators know . 
  while it is true that cheaper $ might improve finnish exports a bit ( which , btw , is not a simple correlation and such claims need their own in-depth analyses ) there are other much bigger factors that affect finland 's economic performance that need to be remedied . 
  and unlike you imply there 's no simple patent medicine to deal with those problems , they need wider structural reforms . 
   perchance it was me using expressions like i 'm expecting and i bet that ? 
  because you 're absolutely right !, 
  yup . 
   however you have to admit that the post itself is rather biased , however , you judging a film which you have n't even seen is not biased at all . 
  / s but good to hear it 's now on your watchlist . 
   do you want to bet that no humane russian will be mentioned of in this film ? 
  i bet you have n't actually seen the film . 
   after all , germany was n't exactly nice to poland in ww2 , but somehow i only read news about poland and germany it generally has to do with good and mutually beneficial trade . 
  that 's probably because germany has acknowledged the atrocities done under the nazi regime . 
  they have not denied them from existing . 
  instead they have apologized and made amendments . 
  and that 's decent and the least thing you can do . 
  quite unlike soviet union/russia . 
  better to read the report : [ oecd economic surveys - greece , november 2013 ] ( http://www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/grc_overview_eng_2013.pdf )  dealing with growth obstacles through further structural reforms :  major structural reforms have been introduced in several domains , but more needs to be done . 
  a rapid , sustained and inclusive recovery is key to debt sustainability , employment creation and easing the social costs of the crisis . 
  major restructuring and recapitalisation of banks have provided the basis for credit provision to the economy . 
  however large portfolios of bad assets continue to weigh on credit supply , especially to small and medium enterprises ( smes ) . 
  although administrative burdens have been already somewhat reduced , remaining product market impediments continue to hinder further improvements in price competitiveness , and further reallocation of resources towards exports is needed . 
  reform of the public administration has been slow , however efforts to address the serious inefficiencies of the large public service have recently accelerated . 
  tax evasion remains a key concern . 
  the judicial process is improving , but it is still slow and costly . 
  important reforms in legislation and procedures have taken place , but their effectiveness can only be appreciated in the next few years . 
  continuous monitoring and evaluation of the reform process is of crucial importance . 
  oecd 's key recommendations . 
  economic recovery * accelerating and broadening the structural reform programme is essential for sustainable recovery . 
  in this respect , stronger reform ownership by all line-ministries , a better coordination of reform implementation and enhanced monitoring and evaluation of reform outcomes are essential . 
  evaluation results should be disseminated . 
  * implement fiscal consolidation measures as planned . 
  if growth is weaker than expected , let the automatic stabilisers operate . 
  * if negative macroeconomic risks materialise and nominal growth proves weaker than expected , even with full and timely implementation of structural reforms , serious consideration should be given to further assistance to achieve debt sustainability . 
  * enhance management of troubled assets and maximise recoveries in order to increase banks ' ability to grant credit in the medium term . 
  dealing with obstacles to growth * further reduce administrative burdens to promote investment . 
  continue streamlining administrative procedures for exports and imports and simplifying licensing procedures . 
  * accelerate the privatisation programme , in particular in energy , railways , regional airports , ports and real estate . 
  this should be accompanied by swift progress in liberalisation to avoid the creation of private monopolies and to boost efficiency and growth . 
  * step up the fight against tax evasion by stopping tax amnesties , identifying and punishing evaders , and improving the effectiveness of audits . 
  improve the judicial system by overhauling and streamlining the civil code and making more use of out-of-court mediation systems . 
  * further enhance the efficiency of public administration , inter alia , through the development of e-government and the evaluation of staff performance based on clear individual objectives . 
  fairly sharing the costs and benefits of adjustment * enhance governance of social programmes by speeding up the consolidation of the management of social insurance funds and accelerating harmonisation of information systems across the funds , which is essential for targeting benefits to protect the most vulnerable . 
  * target selected social benefits more efficiently and introduce a properly targeted minimum income scheme . 
  * focus health care cuts on reducing inefficiencies , while avoiding cuts on efficient and critical programmes . 
  * tackle high unemployment , especially among youth , by strengthening activation programmes and evaluating their effect in promoting employment to focus on the successful ones . 
  strengthen the effectiveness of the labour inspection system , as planned , to ensure full enforcement of the labour code , and step up inspections and sanctions . 
  way to go , guys !, 
  \\ o / on behalf of europe : thank you thank you thank you . 
  and congratulations . 
   the point the article is trying to make is that there is nothing exceptional about russian demographics , yes , i understood the purpose of the blogpost . 
  what i 'm saying is that his comparison is flawed and as such does not much help his case . 
  he cherrypicks a subset favourable for his comparison to support his point . 
  not an honest way to go about it , and makes me very cautios about this guy 's analyses . 
  and he does the same in the other blogpost you just linked . 
  he creates subsets favourable to his point . 
  he composes and then compares subsets `` western europe '' and `` eastern europe '' to the * whole * russian federation . 
  and totally forgets that the eu population is actually growing . 
  that is flawed analysis . 
  simple rule of thumb in statistics : it is always possible to cherrypick such a subset that when compared to another whole , the comparison may appear favourable to your point or agenda . 
  the reader should always be cautious when someone presents subsets . 
  in reality the population growth rate in the eu is positive , and bigger than in russia where it 's negative . 
  and just for the record : i 'm not claiming that the negative rate in the russian federation means imminent collapse or such . 
  what i 'm saying is that this guy 's analyses are flawed and misleading . 
  yup , it 's bullshit . 
  and the op / u/moonmetropolis failed to back it up with any relevant data . 
   ** if ** the idea of the eu emerged as a way to ensure peace between the traditional enemies of france and germany with the european coal and steel community ( and you could even go further back for ideas related to a broader european community ) in the 1950s , i 'm curious as to whether the application of an idea meant for such a specific region can continue growing unabated ? 
  i bolded the operative word . 
  the ecsc between belgium , france , west germany , italy , the netherlands and luxembourg was the first supranational organ , one practical implementation of an idea , one aspect of it . 
  that does not mean it 's all there was to it . 
  for example already in 1946 churchill in [ his speech ] ( http://www.churchill-society-london.org.uk/astonish.html ) called for ' a kind of united states of europe ' . 
  certainly tying the economies together , especially between traditional rival countries , was and still is ( e.g. 
  $ ) an important part of ensuring peace . 
  but it is not all there is to european integration , and treating it as such can lead to an incomplete analysis . 
   in this way , i 'm quite interested in the idea that distributing wealth can be satisfactorily done ** at a national level ** without consideration of rural-urban dynamics , disparate economy types ( dominantly fishing versus industry ) , etc. 
  incidentally , this was one of the controversies over the accession of croatia in the summer -- most benefits would be experienced by those in the coastal regions and not in places like vukovar in the east . 
  the operative part bolded . 
  national level policies are the most important part of distributing benefits and wealth between regions in a member state , and it is mostly up to croatia how its different regions will benefit of the eu membership . 
  the eu will provide funding for regional development through mechanisms such as cohesion funding and cap . 
   if a parent wants to impart his or her religious traditions to his or her child , i can see no reason why the state should interfere . 
  do you apply your stated principle to all religious traditions ? 
  or are you committing a special pleading fallacy ? 
   it 's illegal everywhere , fgm is not illegal everywhere . 
  but it is illegal for example in norway and the nordic countries . 
  afaik even a nip without permanent injury on a girl 's genitals is illegal . 
   and still goes on a lot . 
  it happens somewhat to girls born in the nordic countries , but it is getting rarer - although i have n't seen recent stats on it . 
   i am not saying at all that it should be legalized , just that it is n't stopping anyone . 
  that applies to all laws , because laws are made of words . 
  a law can not prevent anyone from breaking it . 
  the purpose of a law criminalizing an act is to give legal basis to prosecute for such acts , and to give legal protection for the victim who will then have the ability to report a crime and/or file charges . 
  for example : criminalizing sexual assault does not prevent such acts from happening . 
  they do happen and often out of sight .

  wow !, 
  i 'm not getting deeper into this because me and all ( basically ) the academics disagree with you but that 's alright , this is not weibo so you are allowed to have different opinions   it 's a world leader in its own right , not simply a small country . 
  yea this was kinda my point . 
  you need to be smart and efficient , no need for basically any natural resources etc. 
  stupid and unfree people can never reach that level ... ps . 
  but do you actually believe that hiring soldiers and not paying them well helps russia somehow ? 
  i really wonder where you studied economics ... 
  hmm 1 . 
  i think education vice versa improves your quality of life . 
  no way to improve your country without smart and educated population . 
  that brain drain thing sounds plausable but then again that 's not what happened in finland . 
  there has never been a brain drain . 
  i do n't understand why russia should compete with some hollywood-schools ... europe is full of rich and advanced economies that has no `` harvaeds '' , it 's the median that matters . 
  in every single field of your country you need educated people , even gun makers . 
  one 100 employee it-company in finland makes like a billion per year . 
  no way you can be that efficient with basic manufacturing . 
  this sounds like an oxymoron to me . 
  they are as good but they are not competitive ? 
  i really do n't see why you need `` international rankings '' . 
  that is if you do n't own shares of those schools :d  our system of education is too different from european/american . 
  while our schools are at least as good as european , making our higher education institutions competitive will need a complete overhaul of the whole system 4 . 
  but how smart is the average worker ? 
  you ca n't build great and productive companies without good workforce . 
  it does n't help if you have `` scientists '' if everyone else is stupid . 
  i do n't know anything about what kind of reforms russia needs . 
  there really is :d china is only # 2 because 1.3 billion people times not that much still equals a lot . 
  they do n't do anything particulary well but it 's easy to gain some growth when you are willing to enslave 1.3 billion to foreign companies , do n't care to protect nature etc. 
  yet their people are poor as fuck . 
  looks like even finland 's gdp per capita is 7.35 times higher than theirs :d russia is much higher too btw ( ~ 6000usd vs ~ 14000usd ) . 
  all the academics agree on the importance of education :  this article reviews the role of education in promoting economic growth , with a particular focus on the role of educational quality . 
  it concludes that there is strong evidence that the cognitive skills of the population -- rather than mere school attainment -- are powerfully related to long-run economic growth . 
  the relationship between skills and growth proves extremely robust in empirical applications . 
  the effect of skills is complementary to the quality of economic institutions . 
  growth simulations reveal that the long-run rewards to educational quality are large but also require patience .

  ) , international encyclopedia of education ( amsterdam : elsevier , 2010 ) , pp . 
  no idea how to correct that numbering . 
  why would you use the ppp ? 
  does n't make any sense in this context , spain and italy are bigger economies period . 
  i do n't care about your `` military complex '' lol , all i was saying is that russia is a poor country and it 's economy is small compared to many places . 
  again , using the ppp is cherry picking . 
  spain and italy has more money than russia , no way around that . 
  accroding to imf , russia is world 's 14th largest economy which is n't bad but really not impressive either . 
  looks like mexico will overtake russia soon at this rate . 
   their gdp is not even double of the russian gdp . 
  what are you talking about ? 
  the number one , usa , is over 16 times bigger than you . 
  italy is over 2 times bigger , not bad for a relatively small country that everyone considers poor in europe ... 
  true that spain is closer . 
   5 % of russian gdp equals to 3.2 % i really wonder where you studied economics :d, 
  and still countries like spain and italy are bigger :d, 
  maybe . 
  or maybe they would have developed better if they had to be smart to survive . 
  norway is the only exception i can think of but they probably benefited from having a nordic culture . 
  not really . 
  russia is a poor country yet they have one of the largest oil reserves, 
   fuel is kinda developed finnish neste oil is a big company , yet finland has no oil resources . 
  so just get advanced enough and no need to rape your nature . 
  oh and shell is dutch ...  army , because it would ultimately serve our economy there are much better ways to use your tax money . 
  education in example is a good investment . 
  you do n't need natural resources to get rich . 
  modern economy is innovation and advanced technology . 
  poor countries rely on the primary sector . 
  also it 's because russia is poor . 
  5.39 % of the russia 's gdp is not much money . 
  yea but they ca n't even fly more than two planes at a time :d, 
  who are `` we '' ? 
   what kind of middle ages barabaric shit is this ? 
  modern day islam , 
  yet immigrants are more likely to be unemployed and commit crimes, 
  yet i ca n't import cars and beer from other countries . 
  but also in portucal if you just allow companies to build more prices will go down at some point ... 
  oh man that sounds shitty . 
  here every apartment building is it 's own firm and when you buy an apartment you actually buy shares . 
  so no one is leeching your money , 
  how 's that possible ? 
  who 's buying all of them ? 
  well i can tell you it does n't work like that . 
  in example we do n't have a property tax . 
  well you are still in minority . 
  plus every german i know owns their place ... 
  but have fun paying for someone 's investment  i 'm aware of that in austria many people live in socialized rentals , but outside of those there 's no way you can make that equation work . 
  the owner of your apartment making money out of his investment . 
   construction does n't keep up with demand . 
  and this means you would get richer by just doing nothing ... 
  so no real reasons to rent . 
  but you lose 100 % of your money . 
  i 'm pretty sure renting is never smart , it 's just that in some areas people are too poor to buy or the financing is n't there . 
  you are a minority in the uk btw : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_home_ownership_rate looks like around the world most people own their homes . 
  i really do n't care about germany 's real estate market , sorry . 
  mostly yes, 
  if he would rent he would lose a huge sum of money in london ( yhe only realistic option really ) . 
  also his wage would have been about the same as in finland . 
  well yes here every calculation shows that only poor people rent . 
  if utilities and so for my apartment are about 200e per month and rent would be around 1000e . 
  in what scenario would renting make sense ? 
  well given that according to every study people are happier to live in finland than in the uk it was n't a very good joke , 
  i do n't understand ... 
  but the point is there 's no reason to go to london if you want money, 
   also , did he consider that he has to live in finland ?

  * the soviet union suffered a lot more causalities in the [ winter war ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/winter_war ) than in the [ continuation war . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/continuation_war ), 
  seems very unlikely now . . 
  well with donetsk and luhansk then russia would also be responsible to rebuilding the region of war and taking care of its citizens . 
  transnistria is geographically isolated , and really does n't solve any value to russia besides being escalation tool in eastern europe . 
  i think russia perhaps is already getting everything it wants politically from transnistria , adding it to be apart of russia would be unnecessary and cost more money . 
  russia already can use the region as a geopolitical escalation tool , for recruitment ( as this article says ) and an airport for troops . 
  800,000 causalities compared to 4,000,000 . 
  damn , and mother russia was on the defensive . 
  yeah i know that , i 'm just saying most of the people who probably already joined the russian army are ethnic russians . 
  its very fascinating how russia can resupply all of its semi-isolated western outposts in europe . 
  especially if your kaliningrad surrounded by nato forces in both ground and sea . 
  hmm . . interesting , maybe that 's why russia was extra jumpy with the [ us missile defense base in romania . 
  ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/13/world/europe/russia-nato-us-romania-missile-defense.html?_r=0 ) we certainly would n't want to ground all russian aviation units . 
  erm , i got it off demographics of wiki , https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/transnistria, 
  finland lost its karelia region to annexation to russia in wwii . 
  vladimir putin said the same thing `` correctly historically wrong borders '' , yet he forgot to mention that finland was apart of sweden . 
  i honestly do n't begrudge them . 
  all these `` empires '' whether it be the british or ussr are overly romanticized , especially when its the only thing holding your country identity together . 
  thankfully the uk does n't go around reassuring itself over its former colonies ~ ~ because america would tell them to ** fuck off ** ~ ~ because its evolved past that . 
  modern day russia ... not so much , still nostalgic for the past . 
  its the same reason why russia wo n't `` accept '' the donetsk and luhansk , they 're just there for show to destabilize the region when the central government gets to cozy with the west . 
  plus i do n't think moscow has the money or military will to reinforce those areas with russian forces . 
  ( practically they already are ), 
  how exactly does russia plan to reinforce transnistria ? 
  its right between moldova and ** western ** ukraine . 
  last time i checked ukraine is n't all cozy about russian troops going through its territory . 
  plus i imagine the black sea being a minefield of nato & russian vessels . 
  there 's a considerable russian population in moldova . 
  in transnitvia ethnic russians make up 30 % of the population . 
  how does russia actually reinforce transistria ? 
  its right between moldova and ** western ukraine . 
  ** and yeah ukraine is n't really cozy with russia right now . 
  `` russia 's security service has raided over a dozen locations linked to the church of scientology in the latest step of a long-running battle between authorities and the ** us-based organization ** '', 
  everyone was in a land grab stage in the beginning of ww2 . 
  it was a war of gathering the most resources by lightening attack before supplies ran out . 
  whether it be nazi germany seizing western europe and north africa , the soviet union and eastern europe . 
  or early allied efforts such as the uk seizing iceland , and franco-british expeditions to seize the ore mines in northern sweden . 
  https://www.teachingchannel.org/videos/teaching-world-war-ii not sure if this helps, 
  while in america if you do n't like ~ ~ barack obama ~ ~ the current us president you 're called a patriot . 
  i got banned from / r/russia from asking them what they think about the [ winter war ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/winter_war ) and what they are taught in schools . 
  afterwards i got into an argument with a guy who said stalin `` never planned '' on ~ ~ holding finland peacefully ~ ~ annexing finland and called it `` western propaganda . '', 
  finland during the winter war ( and later the continuation war ) had some soviet sympathizers , some who created `` finnish democratic republic '' to puppet over finland . 
  sadly when the war ended and prisoners exchanged happened many were executed for failure or sent to the gulags . 
  you honestly ca n't blame them , too many countries to remember which ones ` joined ', 
  good thing finland did n't get annexed in ww2 . . 
   they had a non belligerence pact that ended up dividing poland it ended up dividing much more than poland . 
  the molotov-pact treaty included a secret protocol that divided territories of romania , poland , lithuania , latvia , estonia , and finland . 
  both the ussr and nazi germany were horrendous for their occupants . 
  it does not justify either to annex territories , displace their populations and damaging them for years to come . 
  stalin planned the `` sovietization of europe '' . 
  russia was doing alot more than creating ` buffer zones ' as evident to the end of wwii where the soviet union held onto its conquered territories , and invaded neutral territories in the first place . 
  ussr and nazi germany were both as pillaging to their occupants , the germany strategy was to create buffers too , you know ? 
  the communist countries such as the ussr and china [ disproportionately ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/world_war_ii_casualties#classification_of_casualties ) had massive causalities on their civilians due to famine policies or execution . 
  i 'm not saying the allies were all dandelions but both the ussr and nazi germany were both brutally battling empires fighting the same game . 
  `` brexit map of britain ( excluding northern ireland ) '' is n't northern ireland not apart of britain island in the first place ? 
  around 22 % of the us population is `` religiously unaffiliated '', 
  [ / r/russiadenies ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/russiadenies/ ), 
  how is this churchillian propaganda ? 
  ussr and germany did have a secret protocol to split europe in half , the molotov pact . 
  the ussr did attempt or did annex the following countries . 
  russia did suffer over a quarter million causailities in the winter war . 
  and stalin did kill alot of his own people through the great purge , gulags , and famine policies ? 
  [ ahem ... ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/russiadenies ), 
   either falklands islands referendum was fixed too , or your argument about impossibility of such high percentage in `` a democratic system like voting '' is invalid . 
  you choose . 
  except it was not during a crisis period , there were international observers from the united states , from canada , mexico , uruguay , paraguay , chile and new zealand and the un referendum international observation mission . 
  oh , and most importantly , ** it was not commend illegal by the un and called an act of invasion . 
  **  under what law , exactly ? 
  please cite . 
  it was illegal because it violated ukrainian international integrity . 
  the un passed united nations general assembly resolution 68/262 , the resolution [ affirmed the general assembly 's commitment to the territorial integrity of ukraine within its internationally recognized borders and underscored the invalidity of the 2014 crimean referendum . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/crimean_status_referendum,_2014#supranational_bodies ) 51.81 % of the un general assembly supported the resolution . 
  only 5.70 % rejected it , while the rest were abstained or absent . 
  and again , if you actually look at [ the too few countries that recognize the crimea referedum ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/crimean_status_referendum,_2014#reactions ) you have a bunch of irrelevant countries with poor human rights and democracy records such as north korea , venezula , cuba , sudan etc. 
  not even china , india , or any middle power for that matter accept the referendum . 
  if the international community does n't approve of it , then obviously you can not think this was ` legitimate ' . 
   too bad no factual proof was provided . 
  literally `` he said , she said '' . 
  that 's not a very strong argument . 
  check the youtube video of the rebel leader, 
  perhaps there would of been less causalities on the soviet side if they ** actual fought germany ** instead of having a secret alliance to conquer europe . 
  ussr invaded neutral countries such as estonia , lithuania , latvia , romania , finland and eastern poland . 
  in the winter war alone , against finland a neutral country that really had no military capability , the ussr had [ over a quarter million causalities ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/winter_war ) , and finland had no connection to germany or intent to attack the soviet union . 
  and a big portion of the ussr 's causalities , like china , [ was due to dictatorship , famine policies , and mass murder . 
  ] ( http://www.distributedrepublic.net/archives/2006/05/01/how-many-did-stalin-really-murder/ ) i 'm not saying the ussr did n't have a big impact on defeating germany , they certainly took the heaviest toll . 
   at this point it 's a matter of opinion . 
  seeing your charged words in this paragraph yes . 
  germany was split into the east and west , throughout the cold war you can see a clear distinction of how prosperous the west was compared to the east , so much so that the russians had to * build walls to keep people in * east germany . 
  as for japan , they accepted unconditional surrender . 
  you are charging your language too much , the us does n't want to nuke the soviet union or china . 
  and countries like germany and japan actually want us troops there as a deterrence . 
  south korea wants us troops to deter north korea , japan wants us troops to help its claim in the south china sea , and germany wants the us to re-enter the european zone to deal with the resurgent russia . 
  poland and the baltics specifically asked for us troops ,, 
  of course there was intimidation , do you honestly think russian troops can just take over crimea and there be no issues ? 
  ethnic ukrainians and crimean tartars make up 30 % of the population , yet there was a vote of 96.77 % to join the russian federation . 
  dude , in a democratic system like voting , use common sense . 
  its clearly has been fixed , no other election or referendum would be so close to 100 % . 
  especially during a national crisis and war . 
  the scotland referendum and many others show how illogical it is to have results like that .

  the most noticeable difference has been a fair amount of beggars arriving yearly when the weather gets warmer in the spring , something we have n't had at all before that . 
  that would be great if there were enough jobs . 
  theres a couple hundred thousand unemployed people in here already , if we had plenty of such jobs it 'd be great to employ anyone and everyone interested . 
  that and there is no point in employing people for the state just so they would n't be employed . 
  although that part of the equation does n't seem to be that clear to all parts our government as it is . 
  i know only a few immigrants that know any swedish at all and any of the others have n't really needed it . 
  hell , half of the finnish speaking finns i know barely know the basics . 
  that ca n't be the reason . 
  is there a source for that ? 
  obviously there 's no proof either way for general public but i have n't seen that version in media before . 
  in here people are ordered to certain branches and their own preferences are n't given much concern , unless you 're applying for one of the specialized roles . 
  the biggest difference between average men and women were that women were much more often in some sort of officer training , which is n't surprising as all the women were volunteers and probably much more motivated to do well than most men . 
  at least when i did my part a decade ago there were no women in armored infantry where i served , same applied for some other units as well . 
  it was more physically demanding than some positions and it was easier to not have women there albeit a few would 've probably managed fine . 
  it 's easier and more efficient to have women serve together and not spread one woman in this unit and another in that one . 
  they need a separate housing and bathroom in the barracks for starters and dedicating a room equipped for 12 people to a few women would be just wasting resources . 
  during training it 's a completely different thing of course , there 's no expectation of privacy or more than basic comfort for either sex so everyone can train equally . 
  at least in here there 's a lot of people applying for `` family unification '' ( probably a wrong term in english but whatever ) as in someone gets an asylum in here and can apply for their immediate family to get a permission to move in with them . 
  i 'd assume that would make the gender ratio somewhat even . 
  traditionally the church has been pretty much the first thing built when setting up a city so they 're usually in the center of the city or village . 
  sure there are other religious buildings and churches here and there too . 
  with the amount of people we have in a big country , it 's not exactly hard to find a quiet spot with no neighbors for miles . 
  i 've lived next to a church and apart from a bell ringing like once a week it 'd be none of my business what the people pray for in there . 
  after that there was an air raid siren on the roof of the neighbouring building going off for testing every monday at noon , not a biggie . 
  currently there 's a salvation army housing block for alcoholics right next to our place and i do n't see how they 'd bother me . 
  sometimes there 's a guy looking like a hobo waiting for a bus at my stop , i think i can live with that . 
  people should mind their own fucking business in here to begin with . 
  awfully lot of nimbys here for a place that supposedly leaves each other alone in all the stereotypes . 
  no , that must 've been someone else . 
  i 've never came across that sub before . 
  parts of it seem painful to read from both american ignorance and posters butthurt on perceived ignorance , haha . 
  maybe i should look into it a bit further . 
  i 'm not that familiar with swedish drug laws for some reason but to my understanding using is illegal as well as possession . 
  i have no idea what the swedes would charge someone with . 
  well to be fair , swedish authorities are notorious for taking a tough stance against celebrities too . 
  while celebrities are probably often easy to catch the police does the same to others too . 
  that is changing too . 
  while many of the older generations have no experience or knowledge about it other than hilariously bad propaganda that used to be circulated , people under 30/40 are often more lenient and a good portion have tried cannabis . 
  in recent years growing stuff at home has become a lot more popular too which is a good thing regardless of legality . 
  there 's no way it 'd be changed without public support so it 'll take some time still . 
  if you had read the article you could 've found that out . 
  the police stated that during a traffic stop he seemed to be under influence which warrants a test . 
  that 's all we have on the issue unless you were there , i was n't so all i 've got is the article . 
  in traffic stops they can . 
  what they ca n't do is just pick a car for no reason and search it etc. 
  without any reason . 
  he probably exchanged currencies beforehand so he did n't have to do it in every country separately . 
  there had been a lot of talk about legalisation in recent years , even before the turn in the us . 
  my guess would be that eventually it 'll be legal to use in here too . 
  while that might be true , it 's dumb to cry about it when they are enforced on a celebrity as well as regular people . 
  if the law is against someone 's values , maybe they should n't go to that country to do stuff that 's illegal there . 
  maybe there 's a double standard in the states . 
  not in sweden or northern/western europe in general . 
  you still used an illegal substance . 
  in this case possibly abroad where it might or might not have been legal but that 's not for the officer to decide . 
  does n't change much , still wet . 
  i 'd love to get one for 4.50 . 
  we could do with some new actors , i 've already grown tired of all the six of ours . 
  it can be used as an aquavit and it 's a popular shot nowadays . 
  jaloviina has different versions marked with stars . 
  it 's actually a mix of viina and cognac , one star jaloviina has one fourth of cognac and the three star version has around three fourths of cognac . 
  basically the one star version is viina enchanced with some cognac and the three star version is cognac ruined with viina . 
  i think the one star version , or `` a sheriff '' , is the most popular one . 
  sorry , we 're usually drunk while saying it . 
  italians use same kind of phonetic sounds so that 's actually correct . 
  my italian teacher always said that finns pronounce italian much better than people generally do . 
  it 's funny that amongst the hundreds of black metal bands you picked one that is n't actually black metal and sings in swedish . 
  what is estonian for mil ? 
  it 's still almost universally legal , fgm is , thankfully , almost universally banned . 
  which one needs more discussing ? 
  i second this motion . 
  well we have trouble affording our own luxuries at the moment . 
  i think adding more expenses , especially ones of which we do n't know if they 'll work , deserve at least a discussion . 
  yay , is cairo eastern european with us too ? 
  we 're always grouped with them on timezone choices as well . 
  i would n't consider france as a whole south european . 
  major parts of it ? 
  sure . 
  but if i was asked to name southern european countries , france would n't come up . 
  i 've always found it odd that we 're never considered eastern europe . 
  you need to have been soviet at some point to be eastern . 
  there 's a bunch of those morons in every country , i do n't connect them with germany as much as their ridiculous ideology for overgrown infants . 
  is he one of the most cited in the field of politics or economy ? 
  i did n't think so . 
  scenic places rarely have mcdonald 's windows to break , that would n't work . 
  the commenter talked about both , though , that 's why i did . 
  none of them have dropped out of eu , it 's not the same as never joining . 
  a lot of trust is lost on our ability to keep things and economy stable if we were to be the first one to just leave the union . 
  norway , switzerland or iceland are n't too much like finland in their economies so their situation would n't translate well to finland either way . 
  not that it would matter as we 're not leaving . 
  i 'd be welcome for paavo to leave just about anywhere at the nearest convenience , though . 
  eu is the key . 
  good luck trying to do business in europe after you drop out of eu voluntarily . 
  the finnish anthem is constantly mixed up with the estonian anthem in events like this . 
  it 's the same song but estonians only play until halfway . 
  i think in youtube there 's a video of a qualifying match in san marino where the announcer is already starting the san marinos anthem while the fans are still finishing ours a cappella . 
  generally that 's the case but to me it seems that the majority of the government truly opposes it and at least the finns party ca n't afford to give up on this after they already amended their other main issue immigration policy . 
  not to mention about cutting the domestic budget and still voting for bail-out would be practically a popularity suicide . 
  sometimes their articles in english are a bit sloppy , either due to poor translation or poor phrasing in general . 
  i would n't be surprised if the remaining debt would be defaulted at some point if they struggle for decades because of it .

  i doubt that 72 % of the population has read enough about eu to have an opinion . 
  fun fact : the referenda in 1994 were arranged so that finland held it 's referendum first and in norway last because finns were believed to be the most pro-eu and norwegians the least . 
  it also really was so : 57 % of finns voted for eu , then 52 % of swedes and then 48 % of norwegians . 
  the schedule was carefully planned so that a norwegian no would not have `` ruined '' the swedish and finnish referenda . 
  their amount seem to be quite significant or the eu subsidies are significantly higher for countries with a cold climate and high wage costs , since there is finnish food products available in finnish stores grocery stores . 
   btw how can be sweden no. 1 ? 
  here in slovakia and i know also czech and hungarians are regularly laughing at sweden about their pro-immigration positions so is sweden so popular among germans , brits and so on ? 
  all countries in europe laugh at the swedish immigration policies , but it 's viewed positively for other reasons . 
  it saw for instance itself as the conscience of the world during the cold war which many people who lived during the cold war perhaps still remember . 
  it has also managed to do good pr and has a stronger reputation than the other nordic countries . 
  it makes the poll suspicious that uk is 2nd . 
  in this poll it 's 10th of european countries : http://www.forbes.com/sites/susanadams/2015/07/15/the-worlds-most-reputable-countries-2015/#688af8438023 two reasons i could think of : many nationalists answered the poll and think that uk has balls when it resents eu . 
  or the poll was adverted only in english-language news sites or net forums and users of them view uk more favorably for some reason . 
  otherwise these two polls correlate quite well with each other . 
  the people that china sends are well educated , commit almost no crimes and so on , which probably makes also the country more favorably viewed . 
  i would probably have given a positive vote to slovenia because it has the second-lowest income inequality in the world . 
  but very few people probably know other things about slovenia than that is a small slavic country . 
  yes , but in finland the minimum social security is 36 % of the average wage and the tax rate is higher than in switzerland . 
  maybe we should borrow some swiss politicians ? 
  how can the social benefits be so high and the tax rate so low ? 
  what level is the minimum social security on in switzerland ? 
  it is much less that $ 2,500 , right ? 
  tbh it is extremely difficult to identify the slavic languages . 
  if there would be two czechs in finland discussing with each other i would probably just assume that they are russians . 
  $ 2,500 is way too high . 
  the basic income in the finnish experiment will be $ 550 + 80 % of housing expenses and it 's enough . 
  you can access it with https://wzb.archivz.org/web/20160508113555/http://www.businessinsider.com/switzerland-to-vote-on-universal-basic-income-2016-5 , replace z with e , or with a tor browser . 
  now even poor people can admire the architecture . 
  if it was a fancy restaurant only more wealthy people could enjoy it . 
  social benefits that are given as money are abolished , not free services . 
  basic income has no effect on inflation , since social benefits are abolished at the same time . 
  no , it wo n't . 
  basic income typically means that social benefits are abolished and the basic income replaces them . 
  it 's the same amount of money that is in circulation . 
  this chart is in finnish but should give a good idea about the system : https://www.vihreat.fi/files/liitto/images/screenshot%202014-11-26%2014.19.36.png if for example - your wage is $ 2,000 a month , your net income would be $ 1,740 with this model , - if you would have a part-time job with a $ 1,000 wage your net income would be $ 1,150 - if your wage is $ 3,000 a month , your net income would be $ 2,330 . 
  so you see clearly that there is n't any need to take some money from companies and give it to the citizens and no fears of inflation . 
  the nordic countries lack completely conservative or right-wing parties . 
  the far-right is also not really about conservativism but about immigration and european integration . 
  no , almost no countries have wedding tourism so that people who are not resident in the country can marry under the laws of that country . 
  abortion is banned in liechtenstein and the population overturned a legalization of same-sex marriage in a referendum . 
  these two things suggest there may be problems with the treatment of hbtq people , other than simply the marriage . 
  idk but liechtenstein may be a bit like small villages are , fearing now things and sticking to traditions . 
  they also had indeed a referendum where they gave more power to the monarch . 
  the monarch can even veto all referenda results . 
  how was the statement incorrect ? 
  who knows , maybe a redditor will fix it . 
  :d switzerland has taken part in few wars , it has not joined anything , there is a language that is spoken only in switzerland but it 's too insignificant for the article , it 's not the most extreme country in anything , or the swiss actually have most property per capita in the world but property per capita is not mentioned in the article . 
  i feel myself that the low number is justified otherwise but there should be a mention of the property and the exceptional swiss democracy model . 
  why ? 
  they did n't do anything to the wall and ceiling decorations or the large fresco . 
  why would it be a complete hell ? 
  you ca n't walk in the street holding your same-sex partner 's hand but is that really complete hell ? 
  that 's quite logical , because morocco , lebanon and jordan are not culturally european , but australia has the same culture as europe , it just happens to be not in europe . 
  yes , the central european tourists think it 's interesting when everything is just wilderness , there is 1 m of snow and the aurora borealis , or when in the summer the sun does not set . 
  there is also a huge archipelago area between sweden and finland and a medieval town in gotland , and after that there is nothing interesting in no , se or fi . 
   naaktgeboren ( born in the nude ) lol that must be one of the funniest surnames i 've heard . 
  i believe that he/she knows that the area north of germany and poland is sparsely populated , and then figures out that it must be so empty because it 's full of giant , freezing mountain ranges . 
  and in no-se-fi the most popular areas for tourists outside the capital cities are the mountaineous areas . 
  that 's a valid reason to be confused . 
  i do n't understand why it is so . 
  or , obviously , it 's how people in rich countries view finns , but i thought it 's a fun counterweight to the what x people think of europeans maps . 
  no , you see clearly how ee was poorer than we and only czechoslovakia and the baltic countries were the exceptions . 
  slovenia was n't independent at that time , but perhaps it was somewhat wealthier too . 
   how will the swedish government handle these violent areas as they expand ? 
  by banning sweden democrats . 
  :d i 'm not sure how widespread it is but some politicians of the other parties want just to ban the sweden democrats party . 
  even the french pigs are so civilized that they do n't go aaaaa !!!, 
  my ass !, 
  but just huit !,

  a finnish newspaper wrote a short description of the ** second ** largest city of each european country . 
  all the descriptions are at http://www.hs.fi/kuukausiliite/a1451283268861 and below are some of the most interesting descriptions in english : ** gothenburg , sweden : ** has been a worker town colored by industry and the harbor , but like the second largest city in finland has been since modernized with a higher share of educated inhabitants . 
  has always had many immigrants , mostly living in larger suburbs ruled by the mafia . 
  once upon a time many finns moved to gothenburg . 
  however , they did n't create a mafia . 
  ** bergen , norway : ** one of the most beautiful towns in the world . 
  cute wooden houses in a splendid monuntaineous landscape . 
  in 1990s was the base for church burning heavy metal ( yes , churches were burned ) . 
  ** \u00c5rhus , denmark : ** viewed as redneck , because it 's on the jutland . 
  has , however , many students . 
  ** akureyri , iceland : ** this fishing village may have only 18,000 inhabitants , but it generates a lot of buzz , says lonely planet . 
  ** tartu , estonia : ** was for a long time a closed city because it had important infrastrucure and military facilities . 
  worth to visit , because , well , you can . 
  [ tartu is the university town of estonia with a university founded in the 17th century , but this is something that finns already know . ], 
  ** st. petersburg , russia : ** like paris , but further away than paris for most finns . 
  a hallucination build on a swamp , on bones . 
  petersburgians see themselves as civilized and european , but moscovites know that they have the power . 
  ** geneva , switzerland : ** rich , although z\u00fcrich is even richer . 
  conservative city of not only banks and clocks , but also diplomats . 
  it 's also a base for many subcultures ** birmingham , uk : ** not exactly renowned for its beauty , says the travel guide . 
  ugly cities are fascinating , just as british series , if they are placed in a awful environment . 
  the industrial birmingham has been filled with smoke and everything that the luftwaffe did not destroy has been demolished . 
  ** esch-sur-alzette , luxembourg : ** luxembourg is a giant amoung european microstates , having woods , mountains and 100 municipalities . 
  is an old metal industry town with its worker neighborhoods . 
  the next largest towns are easy to remember : they are differdange , dudelange and p\u00e9tange . 
  ** plovdid , bulgaria : ** many second largest cities are old , but this city is 6,000 years old .

  fix your shit . 
  ca n't have a mass influx of swedes if i 'm to see pakkoruotsi end in my lifetime . 
  you said that it seemed like racial politics in america were blacks vs everyone else . 
  i simply brought up trump because he and his following clearly demonstrates that what you said is not the case . 
  [ just for fun here 's the currently hot trump ad ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeajrt8peoo ) . 
  edit : just so we 're clear my first post was entirely sarcastic . 
  . . okay ? 
  so you agree that  it seems like it 's african americans versus everyone else . 
  is not in fact the state of the usa ? 
  why bother replying if you 're not going to address what the person says ? 
   it seems like it 's african americans versus everyone else . 
  yeah , it 's african americans trump is riling people against . 
  trying to placate and distract us with such a meager offering ? 
  the clue is in the name !, 
  now give it here, 
  if you vote too left in finland people start laughing . 
  not just the obscures but vasemmistoliitto for example . 
  half the time i hear them mentioned i hear open or contained laughter . 
  can we please stop with these threads until ( if it even ) progresses past just the planning stage ? 
  also i 'd just like to say that you 're not going to live like a king with 800 $ / month in finland . . could barely pay my rent . 
   you tend to idealise murica after that . 
  or at least the ideas it was founded on . 
  now things are changing though they never held to those ideals . 
  i love the ideals america was founded on but to think that they were ever practiced is sadly untrue . 
  it sounds to me like they 're ( and i hate to use their words ) shaming masculinity . 
  nobody ever taught me to be afraid of fear , weakness , vulnerability etc. 
  these came to me naturally as they come to most men . 
  humans are n't blank slates unaffected by natural instincts or gender differences that go back millions of years of evolutionary history and to pretend like that 's the case is just ridiculous . 
   in iraq , christians numbered about 1,500,000 in 2003 from wikipedia but you get the point . 
  there are plenty of christians in iraq and as far as i know there is n't some massive percentage of these `` refugees '' calling themselves christians . 
  why would n't they though ? 
  it 's not like either country is less foreign to them and if they 're able to do it then why not . 
  i 'm not sure how this could be fixed really . 
  how is this ` real history ' . 
  just some stories passed on orally . . usually not that real . 
  pretty much the only time i hear ` all germans are nazis ' jokes is online made by almost entirely americans . 
  i feel like this shit has started to become some sort of a martyr complex with some germans . . europeans do n't associate the german flag with nazism or any kind of dangerous nationalism . 
  edit : typos, 
  so the only reason it 's a problem is because it 's disgusting ? 
  i 'd rather this than them fucking chickens or whatever . 
  i ca n't imagine a human doing much damage to a horse . 
  the opposite however . . edit : people who call this sickening seriously need some perspective . 
  it 's okay to raise something since it 's birth in some dark shitty restricted area , pump themp full of hormones and eat them when they 're some months old without ever having experienced anything but some dude sticking his 1/3 the size of that species ' penis into it 's vagina is sickening ? 
  i 'm not even a vegan and just finished eating a steak . 
  sorry for the badly written mini rant but it 's the best i can do after an all nighter . 
  yeah , filthy commoner should know his place and kneel before his betters !, 
  no wonder the yanks laugh at you . 
  not the shit ones . 
  half or more will go to rent depending where you live and whether you have kids or not . 
  i 'm not pro this kind of immigration but i find it weird that there 's always some czech or bosnian or whatever pointing out the money . 
  the cost of living in scandinavia is pretty high . . 
  the average ` spurgu ' in helsinki gets probably like 1000-1400 $ with 60 % + going to rent . 
  480 $ + rent + maybe something small, 
  plenty of sunshine and warmth will do that to you . 
  it 's all ultimately your fault, 
  do n't be disrespectful !, 
  it 's b\u00f8rk b\u00f8rk, 
  the only thing i hear about baltic women is that they are n't fat like the ones in this country . 
  and that 's usually coming from some +40 year old beerbelly just back from thailand . 
  edit : also i think common is saying that eastern european women in general are more feminine than finnish . 
  i think this is pretty common in a lot of western europe but at least here in finland . 
  from what i 've seen english people in general hate it but londoners like it . 
  reminds me of half the capitals/largest cities of the country in the world . 
  helsinki definitely comes to mind . 
  so one guy is able to confirm stereotypes now ? 
  if this man represents nigeria is the catholic poland now just a bunch of unmarried single parents who are willing to enter into sham marriages for a months pay ? 
  so smug you do n't even bother to speak coherently . 
  it 's because you 're ashamed of your own bodies and use make up & pretty clothes to cover it up #acceptyouruglybody, 
  i was n't clear but i was talking about the `` able to provide for everyone '' part . 
  i 'm very much expecting to fight robots for jobs myself, 
  maybe some day but not in our life times so let 's not act like it, 
  that 's -1 stability , i believe, 
  germans ? 
  just because you 're playing online does n't mean you 're talking to people, 
  hate crime is a bull shit charge . 
  why not just increase the punishments of the actual crimes ? 
  if you can show intent then what does the motive matter ? 
  it 's still 2015 and afaik sander 's campaign is still growing and he 's only recently been taken seriously by the main stream media so i do n't see how things could n't change . 
  you could n't have said the same for paul based on the numbers . 
   bernie sanders would have no chance of winning sanders polls well . . 
  if you want to compare him to a paul you might as well go with rand . 
  ron never had anywhere as near a following outside internet libtards . 
  if you 're going to be loose about it you might as well extend it to most of if not the whole world, 
  it 's the opposite . 
  a finnish man does n't know how to party so just gets shit faced while watching hockey . 
  maybe stabs his best friend a couple times if leijonat lose, 
  most people are n't the problem, 
  as a helsinkian i agree but people do seem to live out there, 
   fennoswedes do know how to speak finnish . 
  they are not monolingual . 
  depends where they live . 
  a lot are bilingual but do n't speak finnish . 
   many of them refuse to learn estonian language because in their mindset they are the conquerors who do n't need to bother with the language of conquered dogs . 
  honestly i think this applies to fennoswedes . 
  maybe not as harshly but b\u00e4ttrefolk is n't just a joke, 
  you ca n't expect to be able to reliably order things in pure finnish in ( thankfully ) a few places in finland . 
  it 's not that big of a deal . 
  comments & ratings disabled . . nice show of faith on their message, 
  maybe social welfare is n't the only reason they 're migrating ? 
  he 's significant but so is hitler .

  but in my opinion , the troika is at least entitled to be more open in negotiations if the stance of greek government comes from a national referendum instead of just the government deciding it . 
   neither ; we fully respect greece to decide however they like , for what i care they can roll a dice for it . 
  but you do n't get a better deal just because you did it democratically but you are entitled to better negotiations , in my opinion . 
  if the referendum has no influence on how the troika handles the negotiations , then democracy has no influence on the troika , and we see how democracy does not matter as it is claimed to matter . 
   finally ; one county voting is n't democracy on eu level . 
  an eu vote is is democracy on eu level . 
  but eu is n't a single nation , but consists of several member states who still have strong national sovereignty . 
  just because some member state is part of the eu and eurozone , it does not mean that all their sovereignty should be removed . 
  the eu does not have the legal competence for that , as the member states have not agreed to that kind of democracy . 
  the lisbon treaty does not acknowledge an eu wide vote which could be used to force greek government to accept the offer . 
  if you want to change that , it would require consent from every eu country , including greece . 
   if the rich voted between themselves that they did n't need to pay taxes would that be a strong bargaining chip ? 
  well , the rich * do * tend to vote for parties who support their cause , both in national elections and eu parliamentary elections , so the rich already have bargaining chips in national and eu parliaments : their own representatives . 
  it 's not like the eu has banned rich people from voting . 
   the voice of a referendum must be heard . 
  well , as long as there are no national referendums in other euro zone countries about the issue , there are no other referendums to be heard than the greek one . 
  if there would be 18 other referendums on what greece should do , then of course it would be a very strong bargain chip for the commission . 
  but there is n't , so now the referendum is a bargaining chip for greece . 
   the answer is though public opinion in all countries is greece should accept the reforms or leave . 
  the issue also being that there is no legal way to expel greece from euro without the consent of greece , and there is no way to expel greece from eu without the consent of greece . 
  so even though other countries would say `` do what we want or get out of eu and euro '' , it is n't legally possible without the consent of greece . 
  so the only way to get greece out of euro is for troika to artificially make the life of greece so difficult within euro zone that greece has no other option than to ask for grexit . 
  this in my opinion is kind of like blackmailing , something which i see strongly against the values of the eu expressed in the lisbon treaty and the charter of fundamental rights of the eu . 
  what i also see as ridiculous that partly the troika is also responsible for the shit in greece , and at the same time eu is now thinking of giving unconditional humanitarian aid to greece in case of worst case scenario . 
  where is this unconditional humanitarian care when negotiating about the reforms and their effect on the people of greece ? 
  the referendum in the family does not change your rent or supply cost , but it is something you have agreed to give weight to and respect more than decisions made just by the head of the family . 
  you have agreed to it and based you business on the principle of valuing and respecting referendums , also within families , so the family should have a stronger bargaining chip if the entire family decides to haggle , instead of just the head of the family making the decision . 
  if you do n't give any more weight to the fact one family makes the decision to haggle together , your claimed respect for collective decision making in the families loses it 's worth and it is revealed that you do n't really respect the values you have claimed to respect . 
  so you either stay true to your words that you respect and value and give weight the family making decisions together , or you admit that all that talk about giving respect , value and more weight to collective decisions was just phony talk . 
  so the referendum is a strong bargaining chip because the lisbon treaty , the fundamental basis for the eu states in the very beginning :  ** the union is founded on the values of respect for human dignity , freedom , democracy , equality , the rule of law and respect for human rights [ ... ] these values are common to the member states ** and :  ** every citizen shall have the right to participate in the democratic life of the union . 
  decisions shall be taken as openly and as closely as possible to the citizen . 
  ** now , if the eu does not give any more weight to the fact that the greek government decides to make the decision more democratically openly and closer to the citizens via national referendum ( instead of just having the government of greece decide ) then it shows that the eu does not respect the democratic rights , dignity and freedom of eu citizens of a member state as it claims . 
  so either eu has to admit it does n't value and respect democracy as much as it claims to value and respect it ( a blow to the reputation of the eu ) , or then greece has a strong bargaining chip . 
  because you as a shop owner have legally based your shop on the principle that you respect and give more weight and influence to wishes , opinions and demands decided by the customers collectively . 
  and at the same time you as a shopkeeper want the family to be your customers , so yea . 
  there 's a term for that in shops : bargaining or haggling . 
  it 's relatively common n several countries . 
  also france and germany prevented the check on the greek economic records when some eu officials found them suspicious in 2004 . 
  for comparison , here are some questions from the equivalent finnish exams : - -1 . 
  some philosophers solve problems , others are interested in systems . 
  some are ethic philosophers , others ponder the structure of the world . 
  think about which group you belong to and describe your views about philosophy and important philosophical problems . 
  a sceptic underlines the erring nature of human . 
  many of our beliefs are erroneus . 
  people believe in strange theories and they have erroneous impressions which are hard to get rid of . 
  what causes these errors and intellectual mistakes and how can one avoid them ? 
  enlighten your thoughts with examples . 
  utilitarianism is the most importat one of consequentialistic theories . 
  among its developers are jeremy bentham and john stuart mill . 
  however john rawles and alasdair macintyre opposed utilitarianism . 
  a ) why is it important to think of the consequences in ethics ? 
  b ) why is it difficult to evaluate the consequences in ethics ? 
  many situations in life are dramatic and feel challencing . 
  for example in the play of euripides , `` iphigenia in aulis '' the king agamemnon leaving to the trojan war has to sacrifice his daughter iphigenia to please the god arthemis in order to change the winds to help the navy . 
  perhaps the sacrifice is justified in this case . 
  some situations on the other hand are mundae , like should mary tell lisa that lisas boyfriend is deceitful . 
  in philosophy , these situations have been formulated into dilemmas where the person has only bad choices . 
  some philosophers have claimed that these kind of dilemmas might be interesting with their logic , but they do not matter in respect to ethics . 
  they say that in real life , there are no pure dilemmas . 
  what is your stance on these claims ? 
  according to classical definition , knowledge is a justified true belief . 
  a ) why is this definiton ill suited for scientific knowledge ? 
  b ) what is a good scientific definition of knowledge ? 
  the pre-socratic philosopher heraclitus stated that everything flows and no man ever steps in the same river twice . 
  what kind of philosophical world view do these claims represent ? 
  alltogether there were 10 questions out of one could choose six . 
  well technically they still are valid money and one can still pay with them in finland . 
  when the euros were introduced there were these coin sets with all the coins people could buy , and 1c & 2c coins came into circulation from those i think . 
  naturally what comes to mind is influenced by the history . 
  for finns what comes to mind from `` defending your country '' would be an invasion into our territory ( by russia ) , whereas i would assume most americans would not think an invasion into their territory , like mexico invading the us , but rather think about fighting anti-american terrorists in the middle east . 
  i think it 's because of the winter war we have accustomed to see a strong defense policy necessary for our independence . 
  our independence day in practice is centered on the veterans who defended our independence from soviet invasion in wwii . 
  only in recent years has the discussion opened up a bit . 
  yes , that too . 
  my thought being that even though many people would be happy to see putin somehow face retribution in case of invasion , in practice the war would be killing people who have been misled or forced by putin-led government to fight in the war . 
  i think it 's the synergy of conscription and history . 
  switzerland does not have such a recent history of war . 
  conscription combined with the recent history creates greater willingness than history or conscription alone . 
  i bet many people would be happy to do that , but instead we would be forced to shoot russian men who have been led to believe , by the putin-controlled media and rhetorics , that what they are doing is right . 
  it 's a sad price , but shit happens . 
  there 's also the difference that finland has mandatory conscription with majority of men having military training . 
  in this respect finland belongs into a minority in western countries . 
  and yea , the history of wars also has a huge influence . 
  the winter war is such an important part of our history that our independence day for a large part revolves around the winter war and veterans who defended the independence . 
  much less is our independence day about the events of 1917 , as the independence itself in the midst of the russian revolution was a rather painless achievement and what soon followed was a bloody civil war in finland . 
  so defending the country from invasion is quite strongly associated with the very core of our independence , whereas other countries might not have had kind of history . 
  seriously , how come no one commented how this is an ideal situation for a modern indiana jones movie ? 
  isis instead of nazis !, 
  `` this belongs to a museum ! '', 
  some wrath of allah that destroys the bad isis guys in the end !, 
  well , if it were completely legal to show your dick in public , then sure , you can do it if you want . 
  kind of like women are allowed to be topless in public in new york . 
  if people want to keep their sexuality private , maybe they should n't have weddings and announce their relationships on facebook and walk hand to hand with each other in public . 
  you fail to realize that except for a minority , people * de facto * do not keep their sexuality private . 
   if i do n't want to keep my dick private , does that mean i should wave it in public ? 
  but it means that you would like to wave it in public . 
  so if you want to make your dick public , then perhaps you should go to nudist beaches or join a nudist community . 
  i have nothing against that . 
  the difference with your dick and sexuality is that it is illegal to wave your dick in public , whereas it is legal to make your sexuality public . 
  so your analogy does not hold , except in mentioned nudist beaches .

bravery is my third name,

   christianity did n't invent marriage , actually the institution of marriage predates recorded human history . 
   since matrimony is n't a religious tradition i am actually screencapping this to have some laughs because not even young earth creationists are this stupid . 
   christian marriages are one thing , and civil marriages ( or unions ) other . 
  civil marriages only exist because christian marriages exist . 
  which is retarded . 
  in fact , redditards bigots are just imitating christian bigots . 
   apart from that , france is debating about child adoption for homosexual couples . 
  see ? 
  now this affects 3rd persons and not just a couple . 
  if i was french , could i make sure that my son does n't end with a same sex marriage ? 
  because this is indeed a retarded discussion ; atheists and/or homosexual should not even think on marriage at all , it is a step backward for them . 
  also christianity invented marriage as we know it today and it 's their traditions and you have no right to change it . 
  but it does n't matter , all redditards want is to attack religion while some true serious shit like cyprus is happening . 
  you truly are the most gullible fools only comparable to americans that say that the earth is plain . 
   the finns would rather be in a union with russia than sweden . 
   nope . 
  actually , yes , fuck off .

  yeah no the csu would n't even exist if bavaria split from germany up . 
  why would this party , and i assume in flanders , scotland , etc , kill their golden cow of votes and their pseudo-sect political movement that ensures that every bad decision they make can be blamed on the country government but every success can be taken from the regional government ? 
  this is a sham and everyone who follow this are retards . 
  true countries with true nationalist movements like suomi are already a country , because our country is not based on lies and greed .

  do we really need mods ? 
  let the community moderate itself with the votes . 
  mods are just powerhungry and biased . 
  you have been banned by davidreiss666 . 
  reason : stop opressing my freedom . 
  * you can only fish 100 fishes because you are severely damaging the markets and the enviroment .

  i 'll tell you about it soon, 
   a previous `` altercation '' involving a man in uniform led to the sergeant being moved , the hospital said . 
  `` they demand a better life '' ?? 
  they want a bette life then the one in turkish refuger campa yes . 
  would you like it if you and your family were growing up in a turkish refuger camp ? 
  you seem to think the refugees somehow are very arrogant when they want a good life . 
  it 's very natural . 
  i 'll get back to you on hungarian fascism . 
  or ask any expert on hungary or fascism and they 'll agree with me, 
  perhaps germany is better at integration . 
  they are not an island so are more diverse . 
  there might of course be problems , but in the long runs people learn to live together, 
  they are to be exchanged on a bridge somewhere . 
  feels pretty cold war to me, 
  some other estonian in this thread claimed he was meeting an informant somewhere right at the border, 
  after a generation , of course, 
  you do n't have an empire anymore m8 . 
  so stop being a smug bastard and start getting used to reality, 
  yup , britain is the world leading in being delusional about their power and relevancy . 
  since ww2 they have effectively become america 's little brother, 
  the russians claimed that they caught him on the russian side of the border during an illegal operation . 
  if he was n't on some secret operation , then what was he doing near the border ? 
  hungary is fascist yes . 
  these people are mainly refugees not migrants . 
  i think it 's reasonable that the hungarians are trying to keep the situation somewhat under control . 
  of course you want to know who and how many people enter the eu . 
  with that said , the current hungarian government is literally fascist . 
  they are not cool at all . 
  also we have a refugee crisis , not a migrant crisis . 
  the masses are coming because they were driven away from their homes by war and famine , not because they want to be unemployed and collect sick ass benefits in a cold northern european country . 
  i mean no offene . 
  but tbh , everyone would rather be in the same category as norway and sweden instead of latvia and hungary . 
  sweden is a better country than finland according to all parameters except 2 . 
  sweden is richer , happier , lower unemployment , more equal etc. 
  finland performs better than sweden in pisa tests and is a nicer place to live if you \u00b4 re a racist . 
  imagine going to sweden ove asks you : * `` zemba7 you seem like a great guy . 
  but why did i see a finn in kkk uniform on the news ? 
  is finland actually a country of racist motherfuckers ? 
  '' * as a liberal finn i am seeing finland degraded from nordic country , to eastern european shithole in realtime . 
  i do n't like it, 
  sounds legit, 
  motherfucker . 
  one guy in a ghost costume is basically ruining our country 's reputation, 
  the 0 is arabic , right ? 
  i know what this is about thank you . 
  what i 'm saying is that the finnish government is practicing austerity measures . 
  not only with these cuts in salaries but also in wide cuts to things like education , health care , etc. 
  the only thing not being cut is the army , which gets an increase in funds . 
  what i 'm saying is that these politics are dumb and some stimulus to the economy would be much healthier . 
  these cuts in salaries disproportionately affect work groups like nurses and shop clerks . 
  who often do n't have a choice whether to work on sundays or not . 
   how is not spending money you do n't have , giving money to the rich ?!, 
  cuts in public services means disproportionately hurt the poorer people who use them . 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqgcoiakycq when french and german banks had bought shitty greek government bonds the ecb stepped in and bought the government bonds . 
  this way the economic pain of a private banks was moved from private hands to the european people . 
  this is n't precisely austerity but it is a part of our german led economic politics . 
  quantitative easing is pretty scummy . 
  central banks artificially propping up the value of shares and bonds . 
  so the two main pillars of european economic policy austerity and quantitative easing . 
  respectively serve to make the average guy poorer and the shareholding rich guy , even richer . 
  countries do n't work the same way as households . 
  every stable nation works with large public debts . 
  not doing it gives the nation a disadvantage . 
  for finland , cuts in health care and education are incredibly stupid . 
  this decreases the buying power of the people which deepens the recession . 
  nobel laureates paul krugman and joseph stiglitz agree that stimulus would be good for finland . 
  why do you disagree ? 
  in my opinion austerity is nothing but a way to transfer wealth from the average citizens to already rich people . 
  yeah well maybe they would n't mind that much if europe was ravaged by war . 
   violent militarised enclaves and guerrilla warfare in french and swedish cities i think you do n't have complete contact with reality . 
  it wo n't end, 
  tbh though . 
  who wants to live in romania . 
  us whites are really the ones getting discriminated . 
  yeah i know . 
  europe is waaay richer . 
  we have a people financed media that is obliged to not run commercials and strive to be objective . 
  what it * really * sounds like is that that guy do n't like brown people . 
  well they have the most of them/capita , so it 's not so weird that they have problems . 
  it 's wikipedia, 
  ] some human rights activists claim that at least 80 % of the hostages were killed by indiscriminate russian fire . 
  [ 6 ] according to felgenhauer , `` it was not a hostage rescue operation ... but an army operation aimed at wiping out the terrorists . 
  '' [ 91 ] david satter of the hudson institute said the incident `` presents a chilling portrait of the russian leadership and its total disregard for human life '' . 
  [ 100 ] these are quotes from the wiki article . 
  obviously they are n't necessarily totally reliable . 
  but probably the russian government was n't doing a very good operation . 
  they have the 2nd largest army so they have capacity for complicated operations , given that this seems very shady . 
  maybe some russians can give some insights ? 
  also i think they were also doing it for chechen nationalism ? 
   they are 100 % not comparable oh yeah right . 
  white people were dying in ww2 . 
  totally different . 
  on a more serious note . 
  the jewish people were refugees before , during and after the war , much like 12 million out of 20 million have had to flee from their homes . 
  totally . 
  every country should strive o be more like lithuania . 
  what are the portuguese doing in luxemburg ? 
  but the internet told me sweden is an atheist , socialist , feminist , muslim hellhole, 
  2011 they were offered to be a part of the government but declined . 
  also sd has roots in actual fascist movements while ps have roots in more normal populism .

  this is the problem . 
  to fix the situation you have to first decrease consumption , free people from unproductive work and enable them to seek employment or entrepreneurship from the private sector , then the situation will become stable again and after the private sector starts to invest again , the economy will start to grow . 
  not true . 
  when you have a public worker paying taxes to the state , you are just recycling money from state to state . 
  state expenditure is always paid by the private sector that generates goods and services . 
  greek companies are still exporting goods and servicing tourists , that is where the real flow of money comes that pays taxes and keep the state up . 
  that goes too far , besides the only way the greek state is going to be able to pay its debts is to have a free market economy based on its citizen being able to work and live free . 
  right now the question is will the greek people change their political and general culture so that it will enable this or not . 
  if they will adapt then there is no question on will they be able to pay of their debts , on the other hand if their culture wo n't change then there is no hope to get any money back . 
  or could it be that countries needing the help of the imf have already ran their economies to the ground ? 
   lagarde , predicting that the debt crisis has yet to run its course , adds : `` do you know what ? 
  as far as athens is concerned , i also think about all those people who are trying to escape tax all the time . 
  all these people in greece who are trying to escape tax . '', 
  she says she thinks `` equally '' about greeks deprived of public services and greek citizens not paying their tax . 
    `` i think they should also help themselves collectively . '', 
  asked how , she replies : `` by all paying their tax . '', 
  what is the problem ? 
  she is completely right about this . 
  they are paid based on the real value of their work , if they would be paid more , then they would be replaced by machines . 
  actually that is the case that has been happening in many workplaces and that trend will only increase in the future . 
  and going back to value creation , when an engineer for example makes a small optimization to machine , due to scale of operation , that little optimization will end up in thousands or hundreds of thousands of machines , thus generating an huge amount of value . 
  on the otherhand people in jobs that do n't have that operation of scale in their jobs , are bound to their physical limits on much value they can generate . 
  first of all , western societies are largely funded by the middle and upper middle classes , people who make minimum wage are n't net contributors , they in their whole life time will usually generate a net loss for the state . 
  for example the swedish state has researched this issue a lot and they have come into conclusion that economic benefits that the immigrants bring are largely the same size as the losses they cause . 
  and like i said before , there are unemployed people already . 
  another issue is that if the immigrants plan is to just make money and go back home , then yes , earning that minimum wage makes him rich when he goes back , but if he decides to stay at the host society , he will likely lead a poor life . 
  in a wealthy and rich place like greece they have wealth to redistribute to cover basic needs for people in need , however their state fails at this and that actually is the fault of greeks and they are the only ones who can fix the situation . 
  the best thing to do in case of people immigrating illegally due to economic conditions is to tell few facts at their local countries ... * you wo n't get rich working in europe * you will not get good work in europe * you will be deported at the first instance from europe * if somebody tells you otherwise , they are lying . 
  these are basic facts that need to be communicated , along with rationalization on why things are so ... * even most basic jobs need formal training . 
  * almost all jobs need ability to speak local language . 
  * there are already lots of unemployed people . 
  people in poor or developing countries do n't know these things . 
  what they only will hear is stories about a rich place where their cousins cousin succeeded by his own words . 
  what will happen is that many people will use all their family 's live saving to get to europe and then wreck their lives when they encounter the reality . 
  i have nothing against legal immigration that is based on quantified needs to get workers and where the host country can make sure that people actually are able to start their lives here . 
  i also have nothing against giving asylums for a limited number of people . 
  however the fact is that we have to first make sure that our own societies continue to work and when we have done that we can concentrate on helping others . 
  also to note that the best way for european to help people in poor countries is to either reduce eu agricultural subsidies or get them repealed completely . 
  that would help much more people in poor countries than anything else . 
   this means nothing . 
  gdp per capita is the mean value of gdp . 
  this is a very lame measure . 
  that 's like saying that a slave owner and his slave make `` x/2 '' euros , where x is the total amount of euros owned by both of them . 
  it 's obvious that the slave makes nothing ( 0 ) and the owner makes x. 
  you might want to use the median or mod for this . 
  it is purely internal matter of eu member states do they do wealth redistribution inside their society and on what scale . 
  for example nordic countries have quite large schemes to redistribute wealth between their citizens . 
   imposed . 
  greeks voted for socialism , and got neolibaralism . 
  now we are voting for euro-communism ( there has to be someone that has the guts to nationalise infrastructure ala argentina ) . 
  if this does n't work , there are proper communists to vote for . 
  the greek people can vote for socialists , however that does n't mean that the eu has an obligation to give bailout money for them if they oppose conditions attached to them . 
  the greek people can also choose to default their debts , that is their freedom , but again there is no obligation for the eu to make sure greek businesses and banks wo n't go bankrupt . 
  the greek state can also nationalize their infrastructure , but they have to pay a compensation to the owners of that infrastructure , if they do n't , then they are braking eu regulations heavily . 
  actually i do n't understand the point nationalizing infrastructure like for example electricity production or distribution networks , the nordic countries have all that privatized for ages and the price of energy determined in an energy market , and still energy and energy transmission prices are on of the lowest in the eu . 
  so is nationalization really the answer or is the problem something else ? 
  average citizen in countries like romania and bulgaria have things lot worse than average citizen in greece . 
  that is the main thing and that is the thing that will dictate from where money is taken and where it is going to be used . 
  the whole eastern europe has on average lower living standards than the greeks . 
  that is a fact . 
  in the future all southern european economies have to get used to the idea that they will turn from net benefiters to net payers in the union , that their tax money is used somewhere else . 
  it does n't matter on what the debt-to-gdp ratio is or what the deficit is , italy has been a net payer for ever , so will have to other southern states become too . 
  with money comes obligations , there is no free lunch . 
  if you want money more money to flow from richer countries to poorer countries you have to accept that there will be federal controllers that are going to make sure that the money is well spend . 
  however , you do understand that in federal europe greece would be considered a moderately rich country that would need to send money into poor ex-communist and ex-soviet countries . 
  not to mention that if and when the union enlarges to ukraine and belarus , those two countries need the money much more than any of the current eu states . 
  the northern you go , the harder it becomes to survive . 
  either things work as you planned or you die during the winter . 
  the eu does n't care about who you vote , what they remind is that anyone in power will have to accept that they are n't free from the consequences of their actions . 
  if whatever party comes into power in the next election and decides not to follow austerity program , then the eu will not give any bailout money . 
  however , my question was directed on how has the eu intervened in the last 20 years as the previous poster claimed . 
  can you specify how the eu intervenes exactly ? 
  so you are n't saying that people from other eu countries should pay the expenses of the greek state ? 
  it is not the business of the european union to intervene to internal matters of member states that it has n't been given authority to do so . 
  if member states want the eu to intervene to their internal matters , then the member states and their citizens have to give up of their sovereignty more to do so . 
  i beg to differ , the [ gdp per capita in ppp ] ( http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=gdp+per+capita+ppp+greece ) and nominal values are much higher today than they were before the euro . 
  however if you define the state of the economy by measuring on how many people were unemployed and how the society redistributed money , then yes , today 's economy is much worse for many . 
  but that is an internal choice that the greek people and the government had made . 
  previously the state created jobs and redistributed wealth by printing out money , hence the high inflation . 
  now the state ca n't do that anymore - the only way for the state to do the same is to actually tax the people . 
  what you want to ask is why are n't the greeks willing to be taxed . 
   if for some reason eu keeps supporting the policies and politicians that brought greece to this and ignoring the monopolistic nature of greek economy is n't that more or less blaming the eu ? 
  are you saying that it is europe 's fault that greek constitution has tax free status for shipping ? 
  the greek economy was in much worse shape before the euro , the difference is that there is different distribution of people that are taking the pain . 
  take a look at [ inflation history in greece ] ( http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=inflation+in+greece+history ) . 
  previously there were too people who got left behind inflation , their wages did n't rise , their savings lost their value ... now the pain is mostly taken by people who are dependent on the state , either being employed by it or receiving benefits from it . 
  that is quite impressive amount of translation work done . 
  how much does the books cost ? 
  i think that one of the reason why there are almost no translation of educational and science books from english to finnish that any book would be prohibitively expensive , in my opinion even the book i mentioned is prohibitively expensive . 
  in our university we had [ this ] ( http://www.amazon.com/sears-zemanskys-university-physics-edition/dp/0201603225/ref=pd_sim_sbs_b_1 ) for our physics courses ... 
  he has graduated from university and been long in the politics , how in the hell he is n't able to speak better english ? 
  i could n't have graduated from the university if i would n't have had good english skills : most of the scientific articles and literature are in english . 
  there are exports and then there are exports . 
  the problem on looking at european export/import statistics is that european manufacturing networks are european wide , you have multiple suppliers and contractors in different countries taking part to the same manufacturing process : a german supplier exports a component to a french company , the french company assembles it with their part and exports it to another german company that makes the final assembly and then exports it out of the eu . 
  now this was a simple example , in reality parts and components jump from country to country multiple times , ballooning up the export/import statistics . 
  you also should not only look on german exports/imports , you should also look on the balance of payments that includes payments from services , licenses , dividends , etc. . that increases much the importance of the extra-european trade . 
  china is a market , india is a market , latin america is a market , russia is a market - these are the are markets where export driven european economies export and grow , not southern europe . 
  countries largely take positions that benefit or are at least neutral to their corporations and workers . 
  even if you are highly minded politician , you will face political reality that is largely created and influenced by corporations and unions . 
  thus if you are going to make a simulation of a treaty negoation , you have to count in the diverse interests that different groups in different societies play .

  my parents were used to finnish and swedish standards of living and to them eastern europe was dirt poor . 
  i myself visited west germany first time around 1988 , and god damn , it was much more richer , prosperous and developed than finland . 
  the first time i myself visited former ddr , from rostock to berlin in around 2001 , they still had n't caught west germany of 1988 , actually rostock still had ruins and abandoned building from the second world . 
  actually one example really testifies who horrendous and poor life in east germany was ...  due to the strong german tradition of drinking coffee , coffee imports were one of the most important for consumers . 
  a massive rise in coffee prices in 1976 -- 77 led to a quadrupling of the annual costs of importing coffee compared to 1972 -- 75 . 
  this caused severe financial problems for the gdr , which perennially lacked hard currency . 
   as a result , in the summer of 1977 the politburo withdrew most cheaper brands of coffee from sale , limited use in restaurants , and effectively withdrew its provision in public offices and state enterprises . 
  in addition , an infamous new type of coffee was introduced , mischkaffee ( mixed coffee ) , which was 51 % coffee and 49 % a range of fillers , including chicory , rye , and sugar beet . 
  that is low . 
  while in east germany you might have gotten an apartment and car , if you can call a trabant a car , they were n't of high quality . 
  compare this to capitalist countries such as west germany , sweden or finland were everybody too had apartments/houses of much better quality , bigger and faster cars , and no need to worry about society declaring coffee an unaffordable luxury . 
  by the way , did i mention that i have visited ussr ? 
  that place was ultra poor , actually ddr would have been in the same level if not the ussr would have subsidized them via selling them oil and gas under market prices and allowing ddr to sell oil to west , make profit out of the trade and get hard currency to subsidize living conditions in the country . 
   first day after they finished college they had already received a 100 % free ( as in ownership - not rent ) apartment from the state , and each got a well paid job in their field - jobs which they loved . 
  everything is relative . 
  if your parents had born for example in the us or in developed western european countries they would have bought their own three bed room house and two cars after graduating and getting jobs . 
   a child 's abilities and talents ought to shape his or her future . 
  instead , the german education system sorts children on the basis of social background . 
  of 100 children from well-educated families , 79 reach the upper level of high school , compared with only 43 from non-educated families . 
  this again . 
  how hard it is for journalists to accept that we all have different genetic backgrounds and those backgrounds also impact us . 
  iq is [ heritable ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/heritability_of_iq ) trait thus it is n't really abnormal that parents that have higher iq will usually get children that too have higher iq . 
  in my honest opinion people should concentrate less on making everybody the same , this wo n't achieve social justice , it just makes everybody mediocre . 
  instead a better thing to do would be to concentrate on making society and life good for everybody . 
  there should be a law that ... * automatically strips citizenship from people who have taken part on foreign armed conflict as active participant . 
  * automatically puts these people on schengen information system blacklist and their entry will be banned to the union area . 
  * in case they try to get asylum or enter the union area , they should be directly deported , and in cases where it is n't possible , shipped to a concentration camp to a remote non-union location for indefinite time . 
  cumulative balance of payments as a % of gdp vs. private/public debt as a % of gdp . 
  balance of payments is much nicer estimator because it tracks actually money flows . 
   are you that unfamiliar with keynes ? 
  can one possibly be ? 
  i 'm not advocating massive infrastructure spending before a crisis , i 'm advocating infrastructure spending to get out of the fucking crisis . 
  i 'm very familiar with keynes and keynes does n't work when you waste your money into project that do n't produce anything , not to mention that infrastructure spending does n't really distribute money widely , most of it goes to companies that produce materials , not to the few workers that are employed by it . 
  any attempt to build new high speed rail-lines and wind power will cause the same effect that the spanish spending programs did in 2008 and 2009 - make sure total bankruptcy . 
   also , spain had no deficit and little debt before the crisis . 
  yet that 's what we 're made to believe is the panacea . 
  look at how great that worked out !, 
   you know what made the spanish economy tank ? 
  banks that had to then be bailed out . 
  spanish politicians via cajas , local savings banks , pumped billions after billions to short sighted infrastructure projects and local ventures . 
  it has been cajas and spanish regions that have needed bailing out . 
  however look at spanish commercial banks , they have n't needed any bailouts . 
   you know what 's responsible for much of the public debt increase in france in the past few years ? 
  hundreds of billions . 
  and nothing to show for it . 
  debt in france is growing because the french economy does n't generate new growth , because it is strangled by high taxation , rigid labor legislation and entrepreneur hostile bureaucracy . 
   now we 're being told that financing clean energy is not possible by the ecb . 
  really ? 
  first of all wind electricity is not clean , not even nearly . 
  first of all huge amount of steel , concrete and other materials go to building of these plants , secondly due to huge load variations they cause electricity networks have to be hugely expanded and fast back up power build that there are hardly any benefits to the environment . 
  however supporting wind and solar power is actually a good way to hand out industrial subsidies to your ailing machine building and chemical processing industries . 
  * cough * germany * cough ... 
  however if a country does n't have these industries , then it is not just simply wasting good money , but burning good money away . 
  not to mention of course that wind and solar energy are very expensive . 
  for example currently it is approx 20 % cheaper to run new energy intensive plants in us than it is in germany , and that gap is widening every year for the benefit of us . 
  maybe germans can deal with this , but other eu countries are ill suited to face it . 
  please take a look on energy [ price statistics ] ( http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/statistics_explained/index.php/energy_price_statistics ) , currently energy costs for industry are double in those countries that have invested heavily to renewable energy ( spain and germany ) than in countries that have n't ( france , sweden , finland ) . 
  the only rational way produce clean energy is by allowing more nuclear plants to be build up . 
  the good thing about nuclear is that it even does n't need subsidies or financing from governments , it can be financed and build commercially . 
   oh but there is one thing they should do right now . 
  infrastructure projects . 
  building more tgv lines . 
  more lightrails in cities . 
  windfarms . 
  finance ( not give away ) large scale home insulation . 
  problem with infrastructure projects is that they do n't actually create that much jobs and their return of investment in developed countries is quite low . 
  not to mention that when you invest into infrastructure that does n't generate new growth or otherwise return money invested into it , you still face upkeep costs that again eat future resources from actually beneficial projects . 
  in case of projects you mentioned , they all have return of investments , building new high speed rail lines and wind-farms did n't save the spanish economy , they actually made it much worse . 
  better thing to generate new growth is actually make government services more economic , get the same return with less money , and return the surplus money to taxpayers that can then invest it how they see fit , from home insulation to starting up companies . 
  but is n't yanukovych actually trying to play russia and eu against each other thus rip both parties as much as possible ? 
  while yanukovych and his cadre may have sympathy for moscow , are n't they more or less interested about their own interests , thus they do n't have any real interest to join any russian creation as it would take power from them ? 
   the problem is that the eastern part just does n't fit in the eu . 
  i do n't think that really is a problem . 
  the bigger problem would be for russia to fit inside the eu where they would be just another member state , a big member state that is . 
  not to mention that i do n't think that russian elite or russians themselves are ready to accept brussels telling them how to do things or saying they ca n't do somethings . 
  you never know where the terrorists come !, 
  can you really put price on security ? 
  well ... luckily kone has new [ ultrarobe ] ( http://download.kone.com/ultrarope/index.htm ) , carbon fiber , elevator technology that could probably solve this problem easily . 
  there are two national languages in finland , finnish and swedish , and as long as the constitution says so it is , both languages will be obligatory languages for all school children . 
  if someday the finnish parliament decides to make finland officially uni-lingual country , then there is no need to teach swedish as obligatory , but until that day comes , swedish will be taught . 
  another thing is that people can always opt-in to study a third foreign language if they want to , and this can be for example russian if the school offers it in their curriculum . 
  yes , but getting a work visa is n't easy . 
  you should look more information about long stay visas from the [ eu immigration portal ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/immigration/tab2.do?subsec=38&amp;language=7$en ) . 
  that is all good , but ... 
  when you enter the schengen area , your information is recorded to the schengen information system , if you stay over the legal limit , the system will raise a flag about you and the next time some authority asks your identification information and checks it electronically , you will be arrested and deported and you will be given travel ban to whole schengen area for at least few years . 
  you got my upvote !, 
  you are entirely correct about this and this is a big issue . 
  if belarus wants her extradited , then the matter should go via swedish officials who gave her asylum , not via cypriot officials . 
  if the cypriot officials want to wash their hands , then they should send her back to sweden , and ask the swedish government to extradite her to belarus , but it is absolutely not a business of cypriot state to extradite her . 
   the euro certainly has its place , but admission should have been based on a country 's fundamentals as opposed to the desire for a united states of europe . 
  true , but even , eventually we would have had this same crisis , maybe in other countries , but the same crisis again . 
  the thing in here is that when you give enough time , any country will turn into wrong direction and go too far to make it back to a healthy condition . 
  what we in the euroarea are missing is intervention mechanism that contains instruments to both help inject money into troubled country , but also take over the leadership when needed . 
  for example in both greece and cyprus , what would have been needed is take over of both countries for a limited time to allow restructuring , for example over ruling constitutional protections for state workers to allow fast rebuilding of state institutions . 
  the [ new trams , 1998 - 2004 ] ( http://fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/variotram ) were actually designed and manufactured in germany ... 
  finnish railways bought italian [ pendolinos ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pendolino ) and they have worked just fine . 
  yes it is . 
  both cities , helsinki and talinn , are very keen on building a tunnel between them , but ... 
  the problem is money . 
  tunnel between the cities would cost 1.3 to 2.1 billion euros .

  when i was in school we used to go to the cemetery on every independence day . 
  on the cemetery there was one monument for for both groups who fought in the finnish civil war . 
  we always brought one wreath for the white guards , and one wreath for the red guards . 
  both sides committed horrible atrocities . 
  it was n't about celebrating a pointless civil war or a bunch of people who massacred each other . 
  it was only about remembering the dead and giving them some flowers . 
  how the fuck does a teenager obtain two grenades in france ? 
  that 's weird . 
  oh , now i understand what you mean . 
  i 'd like to visit israel someday if i have the money . 
  everyone i know who have visited israel said they loved the place , especially jerusalem . 
  i 'm very interested of different religions and history , so it would be interesting because of that too . 
  it would be very cool to see the place where jesus worked . 
  i do n't believe that he was a god , i 'm an atheist , but he is one of the most fascinating historical figures that i know of . 
  i do n't know why israel is n't very popular for european tourists . 
  i think that most people just want to spend their whole vacation on the beach , and so going to spain or greece is easier . 
  and i know that some people have visited dubai or some other country and then it 's hard to enter israel after that . 
  and i guess some are afraid of terrorist attacks in israel . 
  but what do you mean with `` source '' ? 
  do you mean that israel is the source of europeans or that europe is the source of israelis ? 
  i 'm not saying that people are any less evil or xenophobic than we were seventy years ago . 
  human nature does n't change and in the right conditions almost anyone will accept hatred . 
  but i think that the target of hatred changes , and i doubt hating jews will become mainstream anytime in the near future . 
  racists and xenophobes need someone to hate , someone to blame for every problem we face , a scapegoat . 
  muslims are just so much easier to blame for many reasons . 
  seventy years ago , i doubt most ordinary people from my country had even seen a muslim in the flesh . 
  now , they 're a hot topic of conversation everywhere . 
  i repeat , i have no expertise whatsoever in this area , and i may well be wrong , but my personal experience is that i have never in my life heard anyone say anything bad about jews . 
  if someone did that , people would probably be pretty shocked , for obvious reasons . 
  btw , i happened to just eat a fruit called `` sharon '' todathat was from israel . 
  i had never tasted it before , it was really nice . 
  yes , but that was very long time ago , too . 
  the people who committed that genocide are either very old or very dead . 
  i 'm an adult , and my parents had n't even been born during ww2 and my grandparents were children . 
  i think that people 's attitudes have changed a lot in four generations . 
  when my great-grandparents were young they probably would never have believed that man would walk on the moon , or that finland would become a rich country , or that the soviet union would one day fall , or that the colonies would gain independence , or that pocket sized computers would one day be invented . 
  times change . 
  yeah , but people who 's great-grandparents were anti-semites are n't necessarily anti-semites themselves . 
  cultures change . 
  many things that are core parts of europe 's history are n't very relevant today . 
  yes , large part of europeans used to be anti-semites . 
  a large part of europeans also used to be extremely religious , superstitious , uneducated and poor . 
  europeans used to believe that the sun rotates around earth , that gypsies steal babies , that kings receive their power from god himself and that there are werewolves and witches living in the woods . 
  now , i 'm in no way an expert and i have absolutely no scientific proof for this , but my personal experience is that anti-semitism is n't common where i live . 
  there are some very fringe neo-nazi idiots who like to spout jewish world dominance conspiracy theories on the itnernet , but bashing muslims is much , much more fashionable . 
  i think there are a number of reasons for this . 
  one is that there are n't many jews here , but there are a lot of muslims , so it 's easier to complain about muslims destroying the country . 
  i do n't think most ordinary people have any opinion whatsoever about jews . 
  most probably have n't met one in real life , and only know some famous american jews like bob dylan . 
  some people have strong opinions about israel too . 
  i 've both heard people say stuff like : `` what israel is doing is practically apartheid , the poor palestinians have done nothing wrong ! '', 
  and `` all palestinians are terrorists and jihadists and they all deserve to die ! '' . 
  but that 's not about jews so much as israelis . 
  i think it looks pretty suicidal already . 
  it 's standing barefoot on a sabre while stabbing itself in the head with a sword . 
  i find that hard to believe . 
  i 've literally never met an anti-semite in real life . 
  i 've met plenty of anti-ziganists , islamophobes , russophobes and all kinds of racists , but never anti-semitists . 
  but most people i know seem to agree that israel should comply to the requests from the united nations and stop building settlements which only cause more troubles . 
  it 's disgusting . 
  they let a power-hungry demagogue rule their country while they themselves live far away and do n't have to suffer from any of the bad changes . 
  depends on how you measure . 
  they still engage in some pretty uncivilized practices , like the death sentence , prolonged solitary confinement , torture of `` illegal enemy combatants '' etc. 
  i read the title as `` stripping terror suspects of british citizenship is ** awful ** '' and was a bit surprised that european law has such a term . 
  what are you talking about ? 
  username does n't check out at all . 
  it 's stupid . 
  it 's like all those americans who are against free health care of the poor , because it 's socialism and will inevitably lead to gulags and orchestrated famines . 
  civilized countries do n't . 
  i think that it 's very dangerous to ban prisoners from voting . 
  i can think of so many ways that could go wrong . 
  a crooked politician could bribe judges to convict his political opponents , for example . 
  or someone who hates some religious or ethnic group could try to influence courts in order to imprison people from that group and ban them from voting . 
  there should be repercussions when russia does this stuff . 
  maybe this will make putin think twice the next time he wants war , because it will be expensive . 
  i kinda disagree with what you 're saying because not all european countries participated in colonialism , and almost everyone who was involved is now dead . 
  so it 's a bit of a stretch to say that all europeans are personally responsible for the state that third world countries are in . 
  however , i think that it 's definitely our responsibility to do something about it , because we can . 
  our countries are rich and stable , and so it 's our duty to help our fellow man to the best of our ability . 
  no one else is going to solve these problems . 
  they 're in france , they 're not starving in africa or anything . 
  i can understand poachers in developing outcries , but not these guys . 
  but the man translating had probably never seen a lion , or even a drawing of a lion , and only knew that it was a big and dangerous animal . 
  when the bible was first translated into finnish in the 1600s , the man translating it realized that there was no word for `` lion '' in finnish . 
  so he inexplicably decided to call it `` jalopeura '' , literally `` the noble deer '' . 
  nowadays we use the word `` leijona '' because it 's a lot less stupid . 
  yeah , but rt has been called unreliable by practically every other big news source . 
  journalists without borders , yle , der spiegel , the guardian , the independent and al jazeera all blame it for spreading kremlin propaganda . 
  rt spreads disinformation like the american fox news and the british dailymail . 
  for some reason the photo here is n't of very good quality . 
  if you click the photo you will see a better version of it . 
  these dresses seem to be some rarer ones . 
  i only recognize some of them . 
  the second dress from the left looks like the dress of maksamaa or [ maxmo ] ( http://draktbyra.brage.fi/site/data/1491/resource/module/bragedrakt/files/84_l.jpg ) in swedish . 
  the dress in the middle with black and red striped and a dark blue apron is the dress of [ kymenlaakso ( anjala ) ] ( http://www.taitokymenlaakso.fi/index.php?k=5688 ) . 
  i think the yellow dress is the dress of pernaja or [ pern\u00e5 ] ( http://draktbyra.brage.fi/brage/folkdrakter/view-47835-107 ) in swedish . 
  the woman on the right seems to be wearing the dress of lapv\u00e4\u00e4rtti-tiukka , or [ lappfj\u00e4rd-tj\u00f6ck ] ( http://draktbyra.brage.fi/brage/folkdrakter/view-47835-9 ) in swedish . 
  i think the man is wearing some kind of a korsn\u00e4str\u00f6j\u00e4 . 
  the rest of the dresses i could n't identify , but they all seem to be western finnish , no karelian ones . 
  edit : corrected a mistake,

  have you ever seen their knives ? 
  i thought it was paint ? 
  we live under a dome , people !, 
  yeah . 
  actually democracy is broken because all the other parties are leaving sd out of debates . 
  but zombie strippers :(, 
  life , uh , finds away . 
  depends who you 're asking from . 
  you think that 's crazy ? 
  the original word for a lion was * noble deer * ( jalopeura ) . 
  are you an american ? 
   yeah , i 'll start a campain for women to stop shaving their armpits , legs and intimate area . 
  the feminists started that like ages ago . 
  we used to have a chocolate candy named nigger 's kiss ( neekerin suukko ) a few years ago . 
  now it 's just a kiss , but it still has pictures of africans . 
  ah , this one is called `` mom wakeup '' ... oh . 
  we shall call it ... bielefeld !, 
  project x ? 
  shut up , meg !, 
   but 66 percent of the population is catholic how did they get this number ? 
  i belong to the church like many finns , but i 'm an atheist . 
  though i 'll probably leave pretty soon , because of church tax and the fact that i 'm not getting married anytime soon for a church wedding if the bride so demands . 
  if things are done the same way in spain as in finland that number is nowhere near the real number of catholic people in spain . 
  hi ho , neighbor . 
  i 'm just testing my maracas . 
   in fact id say that most immigrats come to the smaller towns and suburbs sure . 
  but they wo n't stay there , they want to the big cities . 
  you mean like philadelphia ? 
  yeah , but ... you 're canadians . 
  they have n't even done anything wrong ... 
  this is the right way . 
  paedophiles are n't bad people until they actually do something to a child . 
  there 's been gay pride marches in iran , at least, 
  there was a story in finnish tabloid about one refugee crossing the russian border with a children 's bicycle . 
  the russian border guards were laughing their asses off . 
  or `` you will have sex with me or i 'll unveil this very personal information to the public '', 
  it 's definitely not that common ... 
  or maybe because women are n't taught not to hit as much as men . 
  boys are a bit aggressive in their youth , we might wrestle and fight . 
  do n't hit each other we 're told . 
  i mean ... if you even slap a woman you 're immeaditely worse than hitler , but women can slap the fuck out of you and nobody bats an eye . 
  just look at all the social experiments . 
  women are allowed to hit according to society . 
  we 've known all along , brother ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ), 
  is n't afrikaans pretty similar to dutch ? 
  he 's a jew though . 
  hillary ... left ... what the fuck ? 
  did n't you know the nazis fled to the moon so germany owns the moon now . 
  the final solution ? 
  can you blow my whistle , baby whistle , baby here we go \u00d7 whistling \u00d7, 
  but there 's no proof he was going to sell it . 
  [ yes ] ( https://static.ylilauta.org/files/yl/orig/s3g8oi6h/q91nrpycykrr3ieqmtgz.jpg ), 
   if you are a normal person and do n't puke on the street oh , nevermind . 
  so ... nothing . 
  heh , has n't / r/sweden banned threads about politics ? 
  like bacon whiskey in usa ? 
  i want my pizza to taste like pizza and my alcohol like alcohol . 
  meanwhile finland is considering banning tobacco ... oh , and they still see nothing wrong about high alcohol taxes . 
  here , take our money , estonia . 
  and weed ? 
  dear lord !, 
  that 's the devil 's flower !, 
  even one injection can kill !, 
  finland , what the fuck are you doing ? 
  yeah , little arabia far away from german civilization . 
  that 's a great idea , what could go wrong ? 
  did they use airplane food ? 
  that 's cruel !, 
  goddammit ... one neighbor is fucking stupid and the other one is obsessed with war . 
  sure , immigration has always existed , but it changed the country and population slowly over a span of decades , fucking dumbfucks . 
  not in a goddamn year !, 
  sweden is off the fucking rails . 
  and nokia will be able to return making mobile phones next year if i remember correctly . 
  fucking idiots ... and i 'm an atheist ... 
  refugee xxx : a porn parody i have no idea why 'd it be funny though . 
  poor children . 
  indian food is great . 
  just had some yesterday . 
  i think the stereotype is that most people from asia are hard working people . 
  most european , american and indian people have made a contract before they move to finland so they have a low unemployment rate . 
  in fact indian people 's unemployment rate is lower than finnish people 's unemployment rate . 
  others come here and then look for a job . 
  the rape news from india might alarm some . 
  i however feel that the people who come to work here are not as threatening since they tend to be more educated , westernized and not poor . 
  nobody really talks about indians . 
  nothing negative or positive . 
  but it 's a good thing imo . 
  that means people do n't have a problem with them and they 're doing a good job . 
  edit : oh yeah , and the new ceo of nokia is indian . 
  so if he does a good job when nokia makes it 's return i 'm sure india will be in the spotlight and it will be good publicity for indians . 
  even assad is better than a never ending civil war . 
   but that doesnt make them devil too . 
  doed it not ? 
   according to johan backman , a finnish human rights activists : ddddddddddddddddddddddddddd, 
  well mother theresa was a fraud . 
  she wanted poor people to suffer so she could convert them to christians . 
  seems like janzon is a big fan of planes . 
  funny thing is von rosen actually joined the nazis , but we used the blue swastikas before the nazis did . 
  he was the brother-in-law of g\u00f6ring . 
  soini , our foreign affairs minister and leader of true finns , is working on it .

ideally it should n't change things , but boy have the republicans in the states been pissed about it . 
  so idk , i think it could change views in russia too . 
  how has obama 's recent visit to cuba affected opinions of cuba in russia ? 
  or is it even talked about on the news ? 
  you 're absolutely right , we already have people posing as 17 year olds so that the system treats them as underage . 
  welp , back to square one . 
  senseless yet i hope thought provoking . 
  given the ongoing refugee crisis , one of the more interesting points i 've noticed is that there are a lot of asylum seekers who need protection from their own countrymen or religious groups amongst the mass of refugees . 
  in finland i 've noticed this with lgbt groups pushing for a reception center for lgbt refugees . 
  with this article , i see that the same applies for muslim and other groups that come to odds with mainstream beliefs in the middle east , and has me thinking of how do we need to prioritise with asylum seekers that we accept ? 
  that would be ironic , yet the idea that a god was still sending prophets would be somewhat uplifting . 
  whether you 'd think that a religion or its prophets messed up in the past or not , all teachings do not stand the test of time and some people seem to require divine intervention to accept that fact . 
  source : finnish username that has n't flaired up ristituli = crossfire in finnish, 
  den glider in ? 
  den glider in !, 
  i think it 's a mix of both actually , i think rkp was at a point happy to take asylum seekers to swedish speaking areas of the country specifically , with teaching them swedish being among the intentions . 
  so they 're advancing one of their central agendas while getting asylum seekers in without as much resistance from parties that may oppose such ( center party ? 
  are all of them fakes working for an organisation though ? 
  i remember some news in finland about similar things being done by criminal gangs but with the beggars being more abused than employed by the gangs . 
  of course in either case giving them money is not advisable , but in the latter case i could definitely understand people who gave the beggars food for example . 
  also the english call the welsh and scottish sheep fuckers , and the welsh and scottish laugh when the english buy their sheep right after calling them sheep fuckers . 
  thanks for these links , the statistics are quite surprising to me . 
  i checked them to find a list of schools in leicestershire where i used to live , and was surprised to find that the school i attended , manor high school , which was at the time one of the better state run schools in leicestershire is at the bottom with just over 50 % students who do not speak english as their first language . 
  this is even though at least two thirds of the students there were of indiand or pakistani descent . 
  if other schools have much higher percentages than that ( and boy they do ) i can understand how difficult it must be for teachers to deal with even if only a minority of the students do not speak proper english as a second language . 
  yeah , meanwhile i 'm still waiting for snow in helsinki ... 
  less national pride would n't lead to national guilt though , it 's not like a ratio where you can have 60:40 pride/guilt and try more of one than the other . 
  i feel like a traitor now , i only have stars and stripes underwear . 
  a burglar with grenades on his belt and a machine gun on his back would not be considered a burglar any more at that point . 
  who is justifying what ? 
  your comment is rather vague . 
  i wo n't claim to be an expert on the finnish incarceration system , or incarceration in general , but i 'm not in favour for increasing the lengths of sentences for crimes that are n't murder or attempts at murder . 
  corrections should always be the focus over punishment in incarceration , and thus i would only consider longer sentences for criminals who display no remorse or other signs of becoming a person that could be let back out into the mainstream society . 
  out of curiosity , how would the states do that , particularly in cases where people who potentially could fund isis could also do so with assets from outside the country ? 
  this is just a case of ignorance in my part , u have no clue how the monetary systems would work here . 
  we had a similar instance on a debate on islam in national tv here , where a true finns mp ended up arguing in favour of gay rights against an imam . 
  that was while two left wing mps were also present in the debate , who stayed passive according to my records ( ca n't rewatch right now ) . 
  i would n't be surprised if there are more examples of similar scenarios across europe . 
   there are huge problems but it 's not due solely to cultural background . 
  there problems with integration is not just about integrating culturally , but across the board socially . 
  if we look into politics , there was an article some time back ( sorry that i ca n't seem to find it ) on france specifically regarding how muslim voters feel isolated , since they have conservative views , yet it is the conservatives who are most vocally against immigration . 
  [ the national front in france seems to be realising this now in their attempts to court muslim voters . 
  ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/10/08/us-france-politics-le-pen-iduskcn0s218a20151008 ) i have perceived similar confusion amongst some immigrant groups in finland , and suspect that parties like the true finns could actually win some immigrant votes if it was n't for the totally ott guys like halla-aho being in the party . 
   the only way is to keep it out in the first place . 
  some countries still have this option the option is not open to any country in the world where citizens have free access to the internet . 
  the last time i checked , estonia is more liberal on this topic than north korea , congratulations . 
  countries in the schengen area are also susceptible to any extremists in other schengen area nations as long as the agreement stands . 
  not only can the extremists move freely , but those who may have inclinations to listen to extremists have the freedom to move towards them . 
  we are not talking of those who convert to islam , but those who do so and join isis as well . 
  that figure was put at slightly below 20 ethnic finns leaving to join isis by the start of 2015 , with the total figure of finnish citizens who have joined being over 60 at the time . 
  also when talking of people who leave to join isis , they are not only men going to fight on the front lines . 
  entire families have travelled to syria and iraq to join isis . 
   does it really matter ? 
  how did the terrorists came to live in europe in the first place ? 
  it does matter , and while i 'm not 100 % certain on your second question , they were possibly born here . 
  but back to why does it matter , the answer is because radicalisation of youths is happening in europe . 
  and they are not only radicalising immigrants or children of immigrants in europe , but natives of the countries they operate in . 
  just in finland there have been reports of native finns who have joined isis . 
  when that is the situation , not accepting immigrants is not going to stop radicalisation in europe . 
  it requires direct action against those who are radicalising individuals , be they present in the country or behind a keyboard somewhere in syria . 
  also , take into consideration that certain countries have higher figures only because they have significantly more muslims than other countries . 
  last year , according to an article by cnn , it was actually finland that had the most people leaving to join isis in proportion to the muslim population of the country . 
  `` we were really surprised that salah was involved . 
  ibrahim was different . 
  we did see that he had been radicalised , at least in part . 
  but not so much that we ever thought he would commit an atrocity like this '' - this appears to be the family speaking , not clear who particularly `` i am thinking of the victims . '', 
  setting a limit on surveillance that is known by the general public would only lead to terrorists , or indeed anyone who is trying to stay under the radar of surveillance officials to know how to avoid detection . 
  while the idea of government not functioning openly on the topic of surveillance may sound terrible to you , one should consider whether it is necessary . 
  if we compare surveillance to a country actually going to war , in war we expect the military to be secretive about the exact positions of its troops . 
  this opens room for abuse just like surveillance that is not overseen by the general public does , but it is arguably better than the enemy abusing the knowledge they have due to public disclosure in either case . 
  we are long past that point with the number of immigrants moving our way . 
  the only long term solution is to eliminate isis and bring stability to syria and iraq , because as we stand the flood of immigrants alone has forced eu countries into taking measures they do not want to take . 
  with brexit there were only two choices , one was going to inevitably reach it . 
  it has n't been in the public consciousness for all eight years , more of a second term issue , and to be frank , what is the president supposed to do about it ? 
  i think this is the biggest reason for the score : if turkey had their shit together , i 'm pretty sure we 'd be more welcoming . 
  idk , i 've got both , and sometimes got freaked out by how much people trusted me . 
  not that i expect people not to trust me because of how i look , i just would n't trust me that much . 
  having finnish as a mother tongue and a name people can pronounce probably helped some ... 
  that 's the thing though , in the short term turkey is unstable , but was erdogan 's government all that stable as a democracy ? 
  the question is whether the coup can result in a more stable secular democracy . 
  less likely in the short term for sure , but idk , it might cut short the damage of the current government . 
  while i would not like a country with recent military interventions being accepted into the eu , i 'm not sure yet that in this case i 'd like it less than accepting erdogan 's turkey . 
  given that my music teacher in england kept calling me icelandic , this sounds rather appropriate . 
  what comment ? 
  depends on what you lied about ( or in general what is being held up against you ) . 
  tuition fees are n't going to be water under the bridge for many . 
  well , what else is an umbrella useful for on a day that it 's not raining in the uk ? 
  you have to bring it anyway , just in case , so might as well use it . 
  are they training a b team out of the imprisoned bankers ? 
  how many places actually elect the prime minister through a popular vote ? 
  furthermore , this is not a situation where the prime minister 's term has come to an end , but rather one where the pm has quit . 
  i think it 's standard procedure for the party holding the office to select a successor to take the spot until the next elections . 
  on the `` fearmongering '' , the rain of `` i told you so '' comments will probably make british weather look good . 
  back on topic , i wonder how many entities the uk will be having to wait on to negotiate trade deals with ? 
  even though the uk is a large economy , they are n't within a large entity any longer . 
  i would n't know what kind of entities would take priority over the uk though , too clueless on international trade agreements . 
  500 negotiators and ten years ? 
  while i was n't convinced it would be as easy as leave made it sound , i did n't think it would take that long ... 
  got any proof on the lack of free will ? 
  cause you might be looking to post on / r/science or something .

  russia was on the winning side in ww1 , and the white guards won the finnish civil war . 
  and i do n't think germany can be said to have won lapland war either . 
  thank you for the correction , i was n't sure what word i should use . 
  yeah , he was very old during the last wars . 
  i believe you 're mistaken . 
  psychopathy is a personality disorder , not a mental illness . 
  lol , half of the comments in that video are like `` those cops are pussies , why did n't they shoot him ! '', 
  and the other half is like `` evil finnish cops persecuting estonian mushroom guy ! '', 
  yes , there seems to be some confusion in this thread about the definition of `` terrorist '' . 
  being a terrorist , and being mentally ill , are n't mutually exclusive . 
  a terrorist attack remains a terrorist attack even if it turns out that the perpetrator is mentally ill . by the most common definition terrorism is `` the use of violence or threat of violence in order to purport a political , religious , or ideological change '' . 
  so whether an attack is considered terrorism depends on the motive , not the state of mind of the attacker . 
  yes , that 's true , i forgot to mention that , thank you for the clarification . 
  the swedish speaking people have indeed inhabited the archipelago and the coasts since the middle ages , and they were farmers and fishermen . 
  but it 's also true that finnish nobles and other rich and educated people spoke swedish ( and russian , french and possibly german ) , rather than finnish which for a long time was only spoken by lower class people . 
  yeah , during his life mannerheim was : - lieutenant colonel of the russian army in the russo-japanese war - major general of the russian army in ww1 - general of the cavalry of the white guards in the finnish civil war - commander-in-chief of the armed forces of finland in the winter war , the continuation war and the lapland war . 
  - and in 1944 he was elected as president of finland . 
  five wars and a presidency . 
  i 'd call that a successful career . 
  that 's not true though . 
  breivik , who is definitely white , was found to be legally sane , while the iranian david sonboly who shot a bunch of people in munich , was found to be mentally ill . with most isis terrorists it 's hard to tell if they were mentally unstable , because they usually kill themselves , and so it 's impossible to perform a psychiatric evaluation in prison . 
  btw , mannerheim actually worked as a russian spy when he was young . 
  back then finland was still part of russia , and like many finns , mannerheim made a career in the russian army . 
  in 1906 he travelled to central asia as a russian spy pretending to be an anthropologist . 
  i get what you 're saying , but i think that it 's a bit different since the finns moved to sweden in the 1970s , while the swedes moved to finland in the middle ages . 
  the finland-swedes consider themselves to be finnish . 
  in fact , suggesting that they 're foreigners would be quite offensive . 
  finland has two official languages : finnish and swedish . 
  yeah , at the time there was still a very real possibility that the soviet union would crush the rebellion in the baltic countries and then come after anyone who had supported it . 
  helping other countries fight oppressive conquerors is noble , but as president of finland koivisto had to make sure that finland would remain independent no matter what happened . 
  had the baltic countries ' rebellion not been successful , koivisto could have later said something like `` we gave the estonians money to support great communist art and culture !, 
  how could we have known that they would use it on a revolution ? '', 
  pretty much all of the key figures of the finnish independence movement were swedish speaking . 
  it 's because all the rich and educated people used to be swedish speaking here , while finnish was the language of the poor , uneducated peasants and workers . 
  alexis stenvall wrote the first novel ever written in finnish . 
  snellman published the first newspaper in finnish . 
  elias l\u00f6nnrot wrote down the kalevala . 
  runeberg wrote the lyrics to our national anthem . 
  sibelius composed the finlandia hymn . 
  gallen-kallela and j\u00e4rnefelt painted our most iconic paintings . 
  st\u00e5hlberg was the first president of independent finland . 
  and then there 's general carl gustaf mannerheim who had to study finnish so he could make speeches to his troops . 
  yeah , runeberg , gallen-kallela , j. v. snellman , topelius , elias l\u00f6nnrot , k.j. 
  st\u00e5hlberg ... anti-finnish agents the lot of them !, 
  not to mention mannerheim !!!, 
  koivisto gets a lot of criticism for not publicly supporting estonia 's independence back in the day , but i think it 's understandable : as president of finland an important part of his job was keeping the soviets somewhat happy . 
  estonians are our favorite kinds of immigrants , though . 
  what big swedish population ? 
  they 're swedish speaking finns , not swedes . 
  i do n't know enough about non-abrahamic religions to be certain , but i do n't think this kind of misogyny is unique to abrahamic religions . 
  i 'm pretty sure hat fundamentalist hindus are n't very open minded about women having premarital sex either . 
  it 's because in the past , before birth control , a woman having sex before marriage could lead to her having an illegitimate child . 
  this was a problem for many reasons . 
  first of all , it would have been hard for a lone woman to support a child . 
  marriage was an economical necessity , because two adults were usually needed to run a farm . 
  and it would have been hard for the woman to marry , for her knew husband would have likely refused to take care of someone else 's son . 
  in those times it was important for sons to inherit their fathers , and life was very hard for bastard children , because they inherited nothing . 
  some very religious people have this misogynistic view of women , where they consider virgins to be `` pure '' and non-virgins to be soiled goods . 
  honestly , catholics should let their priests marry just like lutheran priests do . 
  - it was inhabited by vikings - icelandic is a germanic language - there are lots of geysers and volcanoes - ten percent of the country is covered with ice - there are n't that many people - there are almost no trees - the capital city is reykjavik , which mean `` smoke bay '' - icelandic horses can do t\u00f6lt , which is super comfortable - you ca n't bring horses to iceland because of the risk of spreading diseases - icelandic witches used to wear human skin pants - it 's less icy and greener than greenland, 
  i think that while wrong , their point of view is kinda understandable . 
  because when a crime committed by a middle eastern person comes to light , some ignorant people always decide that * all * middle eastern people are evil . 
  some idiots will join a nazi gang and go burn an unrelated asylum center , or beat up a random brown guy who had nothing to do with the incident . 
  edit : hey , what 's with the down votes ? 
  i 'm just playing the devil 's advocate , trying to explain why someone might wish to cover up crimes committed by immigrants . 
  i 'm not agreeing with them . 
  it 's actually bahrain and saudi-arabia that want to build a giant mosque here . 
  i think it 's a bad idea , because the saudis will probably send some wahhabist imams and scholars to the mosque , and they 'll likely teach things that do n't fit western society . 
  yeah , it 's pretty obvious that they 're not admiring the wehrmacht : - crazy madmen on a leash or young men who lost their way ? 
  grand illusions of the reich may seem real at times - panzers on a line form the wehrmacht 's spine lethal grand design what about the men executing orders ? 
  he 's also a good example of how in a welfare state , even a person from meager origins can become president . 
  mauno koivisto was born in 1923 . 
  as a child koivisto lived in a one room apartment with his widowed father and siblings . 
  his father was a working class man , a construction worker and carpenter . 
  at the age of eleven koivisto took his first job at a bowling hall . 
  at the age of 14 he became a dockworker . 
  in 1944 koivisto served in the continuation war . 
  in 1947 he joined the social democrat party . 
  two years later he completed his high school education after taking evening classes after work . 
  he became prime minister in 1968 and president in 1982 . 
  i think it 's a good thing that in my country a dockworker can become president of the state . 
  that 's a good photo . 
  i like that they 're standing in front of the law . 
  i wonder what mrs. bush is saying . 
  are you an ingrian ( inkeril\u00e4inen ) ? 
  i know , but it 's still pretty funny that we also call it it\u00e4valta even though it 's situated west from our point of view . 
  we also call austria `` it\u00e4valta '' which means `` eastern country '' even though it 's obviously in the west . 
  macron 's wife was his school teacher when he was 15 years old , that 's when they began their relationship . 
  i can understand why some people are weirded out by a relationship between a 15 year old and a 39 year old . 
  well he 's a meteorologist , so he probably spends lots of time outside . 
  i 'm not op , but many people get depressed in the winter because the lack of sunlight can mess with your mind , especially if you work inside for eight hours , so you 're never outside when it 's light . 
  and some people are fine in the winter , but go crazy in the spring because suddenly getting so much light screws them up . 
  i remember reading somewhere that most suicides here happen in spring . 
  people who are depressed in the winter think that everything will be better in spring , but then spring comes and they still feel like shit , and that makes them despair . 
  i like you !, 
  finland and sweden are n't demilitarized , though . 
  now you 're generalizing . 
  no , they 're just not super happy about that time when russians occupied their countries , and do n't think that it should be celebrated . 
  how would you feel if germans celebrated their military achievements in ww2 ? 
  would you accept it if people here were celebrating nazis ?

  it is branch of laiki bank which is under bank guarantee provided by cypriot state , not by the british state . 
  essentially while laiki has offices in london , in reality the money is in cyprus ... bank of cyprus also operates in uk , but they actually have an uk subsidiary that operates as uk bank and is regulated by fsa and guaranteed by fscs . 
  so when the branch of laiki bank is moved under the boc subsidiary in uk , what happens is that money moves from cyprus to uk . 
  that money is now away from the deposits of laiki , and thus the rest of the depositors of laiki who still have their money in cyprus will get even less money back than they were supposed to as the cypriot state needs to cover 5.8 billion euro from deposits to qualify for the imf/ez loan package . 
  it would have been crazy for germany and france to go along with this . 
  first of all , it will be the british who will be in charge of making end reports out this , thus they are in the position to format them toward position suitable to them . 
  secondly , if germany and france would have contributed to these reports , then they could have used these reports as position statements and attacked directly against german and french positions . 
  there was zero possibility of france and germany going along with this , but this of course known by the british govermeant from the get go . 
  what they tried to do , but failed to do was to rally smaller member states behind them and use them as an leverage to renegotiate british eu membership alongside the small countries . 
  i have to say that this was bloody stupid move from the part of the british govermeant , it seems that they really do n't get what the eu is and why other countries than france and germany are on-board of it . 
  24 % vat up here in the north . 
  what the fuck ? 
  how is this possible ? 
  who gave the authorization for this ? 
  both barbados and switzerland have very high ranking on corruption perceptions index , however that does n't mean that in both of these countries there would n't be culture of tax evasion and tax fraud . 
  in some exchanges that i have had with few swiss , it has seemed that they have almost been proud to enable foreign citizens to escape their taxes . 
  perception on corruption is impacted highly on what is deemed right and wrong . 
  not to mention that as an eu taxpayer i 'm funding of these bailouts and what i want to know is that everything is done to make sure that things are put right . 
  might be heavy handed to straight out occupy the country , but at the end of the day , there has been so much lawlessness been going around in the cyprus banking sector that the only way to root out criminal elements and corruption in it is to shut it down and put the people behind them to life on prison ... life on prison is actually something that the americans have worked right , if you make major fraud in the us and get caught , you will be behind the bars for the rest of your life . 
  acta is something that is actually needed . 
  the bad thing about acta was the secrecy that on how it was worked out and some of its most zealous dimensions . 
  you know these things make me hope that the eu would have both military and investigative powers . 
  in the case of cyprus what would need to be done is to occupy the whole island , storm banks , storm political parties , arrest all current and ex-politicians , put out an international man hunt for any fugitives and root out the corruption once and for all . 
   as a long time eu federalist , i support this move if the eurogroup does n't acknowledge their mistakes now that things are becoming more clear . 
  it goes without saying that cyprus could have avoided all of this if they had acted sooner , but this treatment was just a bit harsh , and likely illegal overall . 
  illegal ??? 
  how ??? 
  are you saying that it is illegal to not loan money without conditions ? 
   p.s. 
  still not hearing anything about an `` economic kickstarter plan '' or similar . 
  we will need to get people working again asap . 
  people having jobs will be more important than purchasing power in the short term . 
  does n't matter what 1 euro can buy you if you do n't have any . 
  it 'll also ` force ' people to buy local and likely fix the import/export imbalance ( ~ 8:1 ) way faster . 
  if it makes you feel any better , consider the new currency to be printable food stamps in the beginning . 
  a bit like this if you prefer there wo n't be any plan , because there is no eu institution and nothing in the eu treaties to cover this . 
  the only institution there is the european investment bank , but again they have their own mandate and own rules on which basis they will give loans for investments . 
  and there is no hope that the situation would change any time sooner , for something like this to happen there needs to be eu treaty changes that take years or even decades , not to mention all this would need to be financed by the ecb and not by member states , thus treaty negotiations could take multiple decades . 
   the federalist in me hopes that they make an actual plan to do exactly this and mean it with a hope that at the last minute the eurozone will decide it 's better to stop it from happening by changing their crisis policies in general . 
  not just a bluff , obviously , but actually do it if nobody blinks . 
  it 's 50/50 , but are we going to wait until a bigger country has problems to see what happens ? 
  it really is in nobody 's interests for any country to leave the eurozone right now , but cyprus may have nothing to lose if i 'm reading the numbers right ( btw - i 'm an austerity supporter in the context of not spending more than you have ) . 
  the only thing that the eurogroup can do is to loan more money , but this will only by one or two years worth of time , before these loans and loans before them have to restructured in order to prevent uncontrollable default . 
   it 's not within the government 's hands at all . 
  that luxury was deemed unsustainable way before the crisis . 
  it is strange that free school lunch is regarded as luxury , maybe that is part of the problem . 
  when you start from the idea that something will cost a lot then it will . 
  in finland the state legislated the law regarding free school lunches in the middle of the second world war and at that time this country was poor and mainly agrarian society . 
   when in a state of extreme austerity that has practically destroyed public healthcare , dramatically lowered quality of life ( i am talking about significant decrease of life expectancy ) , that 's more of a fantasy . 
  maybe so , but you have to make creative steps that have positive system wide effects . 
  for example when finland in the beginning of 90s had its own banking and economic crisis , the state made such creative things as making large increase to student benefits - the idea was that by increasing student benefits , more young people would opt to study than to be unemployed , this was better for the state because unemployment benefits were higher than student benefits , thus the state could decrease its expenditure while it created future opportunities for young people ... 
  the same kind of idea was behind entrepreneur benefits or start-up money , the state noted that it could decrease benefits spending if it paid people the basic amount of benefits for the first 6 months of starting your own business : while many would fail and become unemployed again , some would succeed and some would even hire new people , and thus state would decrease its spending . 
  of course every situation is different , but in every situation almost in every time creating thinking helps . 
  and again , it helps you if you take a system wide view on these things . 
  that is the way out of this crisis . 
  finnish govermeant , sponsored by halti . 
  edit : also , watch made by suunto . 
  you have to take a systematic perspective to this . 
  yes , it does cost money for the state to provide it , but because of economies of scale the govermeant can provide school meals more cheaply than it would be for parents to provide them . 
  meaning that even when the state taxes more to cover the cost , parents still have more money at their disposal at the end of the day . 
  and yes , it is a big problem . 
  i have read from many accounts that some children are constantly hungry and are running on such short energies that they ca n't participate on sport activities . 
  that does n't contribute on producing an equal school environment . 
  not to mention that having hungry kids produces angry youths . 
  but this was just one example . 
  greece has become a humanitarian crisis , because the greeks have let it become one . 
  for example in greece school children do n't have lunch at school , their parents are expected to provide the kids one . 
  this is very inefficient , costly and even before the financial crisis some kids did n't have food during the day and hardly at evening . 
  greek voluntary organizations of course have tried to help by providing packaged food items to poor children , but this again is inefficient and very costly . 
  what the greeks should do to solve this problem and in doing so saving money is to provide free school lunches . 
  in finland a school lunch costs approx 2.95 e including all associated costs , raw materials forming around 1e and wages forming the rest - thus in greece this would be much more cheaper to do ... 
  however this again is something that the greeks themselves should understand to do . 
  it is strange that even in the good times the greek state nor other public organizations have n't done nothing to achieve this . 
  sounds like that we are in a right track . 
  we do n't have no use for tax evaders and money launderers nor their accomplishes . 
  oh really ... [ spain formally requested $ 39.5 bn of european funds to recapitalise its struggling banks , while its prime minister held back from ruling out a bail-out for the state also . 
  ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/financialcrisis/9719875/spain-requests-39.5bn-bank-bail-out-but-no-state-rescue.html ), 
   he finally wanted to show a firm refusal of austerity in europe . 
  `` today prolong austerity , it is may not lead to lower deficits and the certainty of having unpopular governments which populists will bite at the appropriate time '' , he said before concluding : `` being in austerity , it is condemning europe to the explosion . '', 
  but what then ? 
  so the target is having lower deficits , but the austerity is not the option go , then what is left logically ? 
  is he suggesting that there ... * should be wealth transfers , but that would n't help france at all , it would make things worse for france because it would be definitely in the paying side . 
  * should be some printing of money by the ecb and handing it down to the member states , that really is n't an option because it is restricted by treaties , not to mention that it would be a hidden wealth transfers from savers to states . 
  * should be some printing of money by the ecb and throwing at the markets , blindly . 
  but the problem with this is that it will only fuel another bubble eventually . 
  so , what is he proposing , i would be interested to know . 
  have you noticed that there is this thing called world outside europe ? 
   belgium must decide whether it is part of northern or southern europe , '' said jo libeer , the head of the business chamber in flanders , the country 's wealthy northern region that has an ageing population and a growing mismatch between workers ' skills and the jobs on offer . 
  in the last few days it has grown on me that we perhaps should n't be using terms such as north and south so easily and in everyplace . 
  south is not and should not be synonym to bad management or bad handling of economy . 
  [ what happened ... ] ( http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=germany%2c+uk%2c+france%2c+sweden%2c+finland+gdp+growth ), 
  fortunate ? 
  fortune has nothing to do with it . 
  both germany and france during the 00s made structural changes , especially germany , and because they made those changes and did n't wait for the end to come , the markets did n't push their interest rates sky high . 
  they had political leadership with a sound plan to get back on track . 
  and about finland , last time the finnish economy crashed it was in the beginning of 90s and that was bad time in all of the developed world . 
  economy began to grow again during the later half of the 90s , largely thanks to the internet and telecommunication booms . 
  the recovery was made largely thanks to increased sophistication and specialization of finnish industries . 
  so , essentially north europe needs to give money to south so that it can continue doing what it has always done ... 
  does n't sound that good .

[ there are 1.5 million to 2 million muslims living in moscow ] ( http://www.ibtimes.com/moscow-largest-muslim-city-europe-faithful-face-discrimination-public-authorities-2020858 ) , so a mosque is not * that * remarkable over there . 
  this is just putin grandstanding to show that , in contrast to europe , he 's not afraid of islam , and that he 's willing to respect his muslim allies in the middle east . 
  it ... does n't work that way , though ? 
  it 's only a switcharoo if the two subjects or objects are deliberately changed to make a joke . 
  i honestly do n't count the baltics as eastern european countries for some strange reason that i ca n't even place myself .

  it 's a fantastic book that explains a lot of each balkan country 's history while also recounting kaplan 's own experiences traveling through the region and interacting with all kinds of people from regular townsfolk to politicians and separatist fighters .

  we 're just not feeling it quite yet because the age groups still slightly below the retirement age are not significantly smaller , but give it five years and the amount of people paying taxes relative to the amount of people receiving benefits from the state looks much worse .

  when ` entrepreneurship literally discouraged ' finland gets the seventh place , you know your index is a little bizarre . 
  do n't look at me , i 've always called it eesti . 
  in more detail : ` alanko ' means ' a lowland ' , ` maa ' means ' a land ' or ' a country ' . 
  ` maat ' is the plural nominative of the word ` maa ' . 
  so literally , ` lowland lands ' -- netherlands . 
  * hollanti * is also used interchangeably , but it 's getting phased out since we have finally discovered what dutch people not from holland feel about getting called hollanders . 
   estonia is viro while pretty much all other languages seem to have something that starts with `` est '' . 
  i do n't know the exact etymology of the name , but estonia has a region by the name of virumaa . 
  apparently we just started calling the whole country that instead of using the word `` eesti '' , which still exists in finnish . 
  `` why even bother writing , nothing 's going to come of this anyway . '',

  i was wondering whether that one shot of what appeared to be the sea was shot on the archipelago , and the majestic oak in southern finland . 
  good to know . 
  still , the vast majority of the shots were from the northern parts of the country where a minority of the people live and that only a small part of the population therefore sees . 
  i would much rather have seen something that shows the islands of saaristo , the lowlands of varsinais-suomi , the streams of kymi , the forests of etel\u00e4-karjala , pohjois-karjala , and keski-suomi , the lakes and fields of h\u00e4me ( which at least to me is the most idyllic finnish landscape ) , the flat fields of pohjanmaa , the bushy landscape of pohjois-pohjanmaa , and then lappi , all in equal measure . 
  it 'd be far cooler . 
  that may or may not have something to do with it . 
  i am loathe to admit . 
  i seriously ca n't tell whether or not this is sarcasm . 
  good job . 
  i do n't recognize this as * finland * , though . 
  these are laplandic landscapes , not really representative of the whole country . 
  which is a shame , because i think a similar timelapse covering locations across the entire country would be really cool .

  additionally , do we want to allow usa 's military presence in europe make us dependent on them to a degree where we follow their foreign policy and get dragged into conflicts with other parties ( russia , potentially china ) that we necessarily need not get into should we stand on our own two feet ?

  [ here 's an older article retelling a story of one such athlete ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/21/sports/olympics/21athlete.html?_r=0 ) . 
  not sure how reliable it is , but it is more or less in line with what is known about this in the west . 
  it 's literally stuff like this taken a little further that sparked the syrian civil war . 
  if i was erdogan , i 'd be more careful . 
  sure the sectarian fault lines are n't really there as strongly in turkey , but still . 
  merely an assumption , but i think the main reason xi is communicating this might just be that china is looking for someone to balance the conflicts between the us and russia and the us and china as they really gear up . 
  a strong , unified , and independent eu with its relatively large domestic market could be just that . 
  it 'd be a lot easier for chinese ( and to a lesser extent russian ) produce and money to enter the european market if the political alignment was n't as close to the us as it is . 
  and then there 's our old friend vlad from the east who has god knows how much actual wealth , and basically controls even more thanks to his position . 
  this is misleading . 
  the guidelines they have been given are about publishing the background of migrants suspected of crimes , i.e. 
  they ca n't tell the press that the suspect of a crime is a migrant even though they still absolutely do their job and treat migrants as suspects . 
  this is thought to protect migrants in general from getting labeled as criminals . 
  it wo n't work , and is an extremely stupid thing to do in an age where transparency and openness is valued above almost all else , but they mean well . 
  just incompetence at work as usual .

  they still steal things , that 's mostly the reason for people not liking them . 
  they have also ruined few perfectly fine swedish last names . 
  i do n't know much about mh17 but did it have anything to do with the war ? 
  was it used as justification for an attack or something . 
  if some random plane would crash in lapland , war with russia would n't be the first one on my mind . 
  that would n't work out because nobody would believe that we would attack russia . 
  if it comes to black-and-white situation , i 'd rather join nato . 
  but currently i do n't support it . 
  i just do n't buy that russia would just attack us .

  well , the easiest thing to point out is natural physical qualities like hair/eye/skin color , size/type of your head . 
  then comes the talk about intelligence and `` racial purity '' . 
  discrimination . 
  racism is thinking that certain race is superior/inferior to others . 
  would it be racist if other germans would start discriminating bavarian culture ?

  what i 've understood , in the biker/criminal scene angels are more respected and are more `` traditional '' , some say they have moved more to seemingly legal businesses . 
  bandidos are the most numerous gang and are a bit more fucked up in the head .

  this settles it . 
  nice story but we are talking about refugees . 
  how about knives ? 
  and soviets who killed like 70 % of german troops .

  hello . 
  conscript here . 
  well , here in finland , if you 're male you get to choose 1 ) conscription ( 6 , 9 or 12 months , depends what role you are assigned ) , 2 ) civil service ( year ) , 3 ) prison ( do n't know how long ) , 4 ) try to lie your way out of conscription ( `` i use drugs and i might kill myself '' ) . 
  just think how easily that law could be used for humans . 
  `` this ethnicity has been branded as dangerous ( proof or not ) and have been banned '' your law is idiotic , so is the mentality behind it . 
   it makes sense when you think that we do n't want people to have a lion as a pet either . 
  no it does n't , we are speaking of a dog here , dogs can be easily trained . 
  just admit that that dog law of yours is idiotic . 
  snus master race , one of the few good things coming from sweden . 
  and putin would be like `` what submarine ? 
  we want some challenge .

  what is your point ? 
  what about greece ? 
  estonian alcohol fuels our hard work . 
  well put them to smaller cities , and do n't you say no because that would make you racist . 
  `` i 'm not safe in my country '' - i do n't believe you `` i 'm christian and gay '' - ok , fill this form and you 're welcome . 
   i identify myself as far-left yes , i can see your flag . 
   without blaming their culture . 
  why not ? 
   integration of those that desire to stay nomadic . 
  how ? 
  more like wildlings raiding the estonian alcohol stores . 
  i think that 's the same guy who was in finnish version of dragon 's den , afaik his invention had something to do with coffee machine and disco lights . 
  not weird but rather funny , my stepfather was visiting some caribbean island ( you 've seen the videos where plane lands real close of the beach , that one ) . 
  one of the locals was very interested of finland and wanted to visit finland really bad but his wife would n't let him because she thought they 'd freeze to death . 
  he also thought that when winter comes , the sea freezes instantly , like the waves freeze in that position . 
  i wanted to be that dude , now my job is to spot ~ ~ russian ~ ~ enemy air craft with thermal camera/whatever that is . 
  politicians will laugh at your silent revolution and import more immigrants . 
  my dad also used to throw molotov cocktails at them . 
  well quit whining and write an article about it . 
  i 'd just spend the winter in a cave and come back in summer when it 's habitable again . 
  back off , that spot is ours . 
  rome total war , i remember being about 13 and i could easily play that game 18 hours in a row . 
   alliance of antifascist fighters judging by the name , i 'd put them to same category as skinhead gangs . 
  and the girl goes `` no '' . 
  they are pretty good at shoplifting , one woman put a fucking dishwasher under her skirt with another one walking directly after her and holding the machine . 
  jews were also genocided and treated badly during middle-ages , now they are rich fucks . 
  russian troops doing something in russia ? 
  we must order new aircrafts , dig trenches near the border , buy mercenaries etc. 
  even if this would happen in the other side of russia media would tell how it 's only 1469km from finnish border . 
  what brazzers tier porn sites are kids using these days ? 
  unless you rule out pornstar category , there are a lot of amateur / `` normal looking '' women porn videos . 
  i used to ^ * cough * spend more time looking for good vids than fapping . 
  swedes are holding an emergency meeting over who to call racist this time since obama is black . 
  also sodankyl\u00e4 ( village of war ) , home of jaeger brigade . 
  yeah fuck pure drugs , give us drug dealers who cut it multiple times with god knows what ( in a gangland documentary one organization put baby laxatin to meth ) before it reaches the customer , of course giving money to said criminals and every reason for them to kill each other . 
  if you listen closely , you can hear swedes screaming out of joy . 
   to muslims depictions of their prophets are forbidden well boohoo , what you 're gon na do , kill someone ? 
  i hate all allies .

  enough frozen swedish knives ? 
  did anyone actually read the article ? 
  what happened is this : - acrylamide occurs naturally in starchy foods heated above 250 \u00b0 c during the production process ( think potato chips , etc ) . 
  - this has been linked to cancer , but there 's no scientific consensus of what a safe level of intake would be . 
  - so the commission set out some guideline allowed levels for a bunch of product groups , because they want to lower it , but they do n't really know how far it should be lowered . 
  - a later draft changed some wording that seemed to make these ` guidelines ' absolute maximums . 
  the industry complained about this , arguing that there 's no basis for the chosen values , and the commission backed off . 
  this just does n't seem like lobbyists having too much input to me , rather than regulation waiting on some better science before they put in exact values . 
  the requirement to monitor acrylamide levels is still there , they can start enforcing limits when they know more about what a proper limit is . 
  why ? 
  because there 's no chemical difference between natural and added sugars . 
  ( well , mostly . 
  different sources of sugar can have different ratios of fructose and sucrose , etc. 
  but all the added sugars start out as natural ) as for why it was deemed illegal , it was because it was too selective . 
  it was a tax on candy and soft drinks , so cookies , for example , were exempt . 
  so it was seen as distorting competition . 
  the measure is stupid , but not for that reason . 
  60 % weight on life expectancy , which has a huge number of non-healthcare-system confounders , means that this is just a randomly fudged life expectancy list , and does n't really tell you anything about the healthcare systems . 
  i 'm reasonably certain they meant regional parliaments having a say , rather than just the national ones, 
  i think it 's a little strange that all these projections keep 65 years as the cutoff for when people become ` dependent ' , when people are living longer and longer . 
  i 'd be much more interested in seeing projections on what the ` retirement ' age would need to become to keep a dependency ratio somewhere around the current one , or some other values , rather than just assuming the retirement age is going to remain the same to 40-50 years from now . 
  adjusting retirement age is how it seems most likely to be dealt with in my opinion . 
  i 'm reasonably sure british operators are big enough to be able to negotiate roaming agreements that are pretty similar to this , if they want to . 
  where 's ukraine ? 
  not to mention saudi arabia , pakistan and nigeria , just off the top of my head . 
  that 's freestanding finns . 
  when there are attractors ( slot machines , bus seats , whatever ) we * can * fit into smaller spaces . 
  they would fill up so that your personal space is maximized of course . 
  we 're civilized , after all . 
  no picking the slot machine next to someone if there are free ones further away , like a weirdo . 
  ` great britain ' is the most commonly used name in most european languages ( translated , obviously ) , in my experience . 
  the only one where i recall seeing ` united kingdom ' sometimes used is french . 
  you think danish wages really fell 800 $ / month one year and then recovered 800 $ the next ? 
  that 's beyond unlikely . 
  the thing is , some of that outside-eu business is dependent on britain being in the eu , specifically the passporting rights in the op . 
  not all of it of course , but just cutting out the eu portion of business is severely underestimating the issue . 
  even if it does flourish , changes like that take a loong time . 
  i like how austria-hungary runs together . 
  no , netherlands is clearly tom bong-adil, 
  drexit , i think . 
  maybe condexit . 
  trexit is what happens when the driver falls asleep at the wheel . 
  or buttons , or whatever it is you drive a train with . 
  but it 's not just a case of linking to copyright infringing material : it 's doing it knowingly and doing it to earn money . 
  all these hypotheticals about the content of the link changing are really not affected by this ruling in any way , because that would contradict one of the three aspects that this ruling is based on : that you are aware that you are infringing on copyright by doing it . 
  because * a * hyperlink to copyright infringing material was found to be illegal , does n't mean that * any * hyperlink to copyright infringing material is illegal . 
  you also need to prove the other two aspects of this case : knowledge and profit . 
  any cases where one of those aspects is missing is still a grey area at least , if not outright allowed . 
  future rulings would clarify where the actual line is . 
  the link content changing after you posted it would in my mind clearly nullify the knowledge aspect . 
  if a court ruled otherwise , then i 'd agree that it 's technically ignorant . 
  but in this case they pretty clearly showed that they were perfectly aware of what the content they were linking was . 
  no it does n't . 
  it 's not a ruling that all hyperlinks to copyrighted material are illegal . 
  it 's a ruling that a hyperlink stating ` look at this cool copyright infringing material we found ' that they posted on a site they earn money from is illegal . 
  there 's still tons of grey area , this ruling just defined one end of the spectrum as definitely illegal . 
  you 're again misunderstanding what i 'm saying . 
  i understand that currently , roaming charges are more than the cost . 
  i even agree that these proposed changes will probably be good for consumers , but only on the average . 
  those who pay the least now , will pay more with these proposed regulations . 
  those who pay most or average , will pay less . 
  thinking everything will drop down to the cheapest price , or even close , is delusional . 
  i think you 're under some pretty heavy misconceptions . 
  those cheap operators wo n't be able to keep the cheap prices , when they have half their customers roaming in larger countries , causing the operator to get a massive bill for the use of that network , that they then have to pass on to their consumers . 
  that 's how roaming works , it 's not free use , it 's just free at the point of the consumer , the operators still charge each other for the use of their networks . 
  what 's now being argued are regulations about how operators are allowed to pass on those costs to their customers . 
  it 's about operators having to offer free roaming . 
  so as far as i understand that would mean no non-roaming contracts available anymore . 
  it does n't mean lower prices for everyone , though . 
  it means prices evening out across the union . 
  lowest prices will rise , highest will lower . 
  forced , yes , but they are allowed to charge for it ( they charge the home providers of the roamers ) . 
  so the problem is that those formerly cheap eastern european providers will need to start passing on those costs to their consumers ( even the local ones , since they are n't allowed to differentiate between locals and roamers ) . 
  [ a visual representation ] ( http://imgur.com/a/ybnei ) , from the [ pdf report ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/3217494/7596823/ks-01-16-691-en-n.pdf/0abf140c-ccc7-4a7f-b236-682effcde10f ) linked in the article . 
  riga , step up your game . 
  they 're accused of breaking eu law . 
  i doubt many people would be happy being charged with breaking the law either . 
  i 'm pretty sure that would fall under the traffic shaping rules , and be allowed . 
  they 're allowed to throttle or prioritize clear-cut categories of traffic , such as voip . 
  http://berec.europa.eu/eng/net/specialised_services/ this specifically mentions volte and iptv as being exempt, 
  this is true . 
  i 'm just trying to temper your excitement a little . 
  a 35 km underground tunnel system and a 90 km underground tunnel system are n't that different , no . 
  i 'm not saying it 'll necessarily run at subway frequencies , but even basic local trains manage 5-10 minute intervals during rush hours , and that 's essentially what this would be : a local commuter train . 
  no company can wait 40 years to turn a profit . 
  ze french seem to like it . 
  you 'd still have to pay tax in finland though , as far as i know . 
  at least that 's how it worked between sweden and finland when i did a short stint a few years ago . 
  subways run every 2.5 minutes during rush hour , no reason why the same could n't be done for these tunnel trains if there 's demand . 
  i do n't think this is right , turbulence should n't refract light . 
  light refracts between air of different temperatures though , so the correct layering of air of different temperatures would create a bending of the light, 
  i thought it said former french navy officer was a prime suspect . 
  the richter scale is n't used anymore , almost everything you 'll see reported these days is moment magnitude scale . 
  richter scale measured the displacement at 100 kms from the epicenter , so how severe a quake was was n't well comparable in different locations . 
  moment magnitude estimates the amount of energy released in a quake , so it behaves more consistently on all terrains . 
  it 's still logarithmic , like the richter scale , but a little squirlier , in that an increase of 2.0 on mms means a 1000x increase in energy ( 10 ^ 3 ) . 
  so a 6.0 is 1000x as energetic as a 4.0 . 
  an increase of 1.0 is in no way intuitive , as it 's 10 ^ 1.5 , or about 32x times stronger . 
  very large quakes hit the 8-9 range , so this one is about a thousandth of those . 
  over 7 is considered a major earthquake , so this one in italy would be right below that .

although not as badly as in 2012 : https://youtube.com/watch?v=gvtuhkfo95m, 
  it 's quite an assault that homeros becomes homer in english . 
  homer sounds so banal . 
  yes . 
  the nordic countries have n't produced especially much culture , and have been rather uncivilized . 
  but h. c. andersen is the one who wrote for example the fairytale about the ugly duck that becomes a beautiful swan , and linn\u00e9 created the fauna and flora taxonomy and their scientific names . 
  a quite large majority seem to hate . 
  for example in my hometown the neighborhood where most of the buildings are from the 18th century was clearly seen as the most beautiful according to a poll . 
  the 2nd most beautiful neighborhoods where the ones where most buildings are from the 19th century , and in the ugliest neighborhoods were all post-1960 . 
  the oldest neighborhood was something like 4.7 / 5 according to the poll and the ugliest 1.9 / 5 . 
  everyone hates architecture designed after 1950 , it has nothing to do with this sub . 
   people seem to think that the swedish media is the worst in the world swedish media must to be the worst in the western world . 
  was n't there even a case where they hacked into a public web forum and harassed immigration critics , even publishing the name of some immigration critics in their newspapers ? 
  swedish media must to be the worst in the western world . 
  was n't there even a case where they hacked into a public web forum and harassed immigration critics , even publishing the name of some immigration critics in their newspapers ? 
  the finnish media is biased in most topics , although it 's not easy to see it if you agree with the bias . 
  if you read carefully the reporting of same-sex marriage and eu , you 'll also notice a severe bias . 
  this bias just does n't personally bother me , because i 'm pro-hbtq and pro-eu , but i notice it clearly every time i open the newspaper and read about those topics . 
  and what do you mean `` one of you people to pop up '' , do you think we are some kind of special people . 
  we immigration critics are just normal people and everywhere . 
   and don \u00b4 t bother answering , i am disabling the inbox in this comment our inboxes are always open since we can also defend us with rational arguments unlike you open and tolerant people who can use only emotional arguments and the r word to defend your thesis . 
  i do n't know if i should be worried now but the telegraph and the guardian feel very neutral compared to finnish and other nordic media . 
  and i would n't say that the economist is a specialist newspaper , it has all imaginable societal matters covered and lacks only things like sports or lifestyle . 
  it 's also imho the medium of the highest quality in the world . 
  2nd and 3rd could be perhaps npr and bbc . 
  a man was shot by the police after he had driven the vehicle out of the road and was threating a passenger with a weapon . 
  this is the 2nd time in 2016 when someone was shot by the police . 
  the social benefits of refugees are lowered to $ 1,037 / month . 
  to be more precise , the neo-nazi kicked the victim one time , and the victim died because of that single kick . 
  the crime is currently not investigated as a murder , but as a negligent homicide . 
  as usual , nothing happens here . 
  there were protests due to a neo-nazi accidentally murdering someone on the street . 
  about 15,000 people participated in them . 
  a juice bar was problematized from the gender perspective . 
  it 's investigated whether it discriminates women or ugly men . 
   i was racking my brain `` maybe they mean it can travel with the rotation of the earth and keep the same relative position to the sun ? '', 
  in soviet russia , you do n't travel - the earth travels below you . 
  the fighters did not have transponders as usual , and flew 1.8 km below the aircraft . 
  nato staff alerted the pilot . 
   according to mbl.is , nato monitored the bombers , which flew almost all the way to spain , where they turned around and flew back to russia . 
  i first thought it must be a bit exhausting to fly russia - iceland - spain - russia without breaks , until i read this :  they are capable of carrying nuclear weapons and can travel beyond the speed of light . 
  this sub is full of leftists , if you have n't noticed it yet . 
  italy is a country where corruption is rampant and the southern part is poor . 
  italy is not sweden - without immigration native swedes would have not formed gangs . 
  i ca n't remember at all any gang-related shootings in helsinki , not even one . 
  and even if you would find one or two shootings , they are still significantly less than the tens of shooting in sweden every year . 
  yeah , so 3 wars where both had nuclear weapons and 1 where a nuclear country was attacked by a non-nuclear . 
  it 's interesting to speculate then whether there had more wars if nuclear weapons had not been invented . 
  probably yes . 
  and while there has been also wars between ** democracies ** , such as when uk , canada , australia and nz declared war on finland , they are also relatively rare . 
  yes . 
  so while you do n't get a punishment for it , the crime rate becomes low and that 's why it 's accepted . 
  people think more about the crime rate than revenge . 
  this is because the justice system is not seen as a means of punishment , but as a means of rehabilitation . 
  so usually the rapist would talk with a kind , understanding psychologist or social worker about his life and get punished only if he for example commits another crime during the probation time ( 2/3 of the rapists are sentenced to probation ) or commits later another rape . 
  the amount of rapes and pedophilia seems to be more biology-driven and is the same as in uk , germany or usa . 
  the overall crime rate is extremely low due to the rehabilitation approach and the welfare state . 
  a good example of the low criminality could be that the police needs to fire only 5 shots a year . 
  i do n't think they do , because the crime rate is at the same time extremely low due to the welfare state and a rehabilitation approach instead of a punitive approach . 
  a good example of the low criminality could be that the police needs to fire only 5 shots a year . 
  the average time spent in prison for murder is 12 years , so on average the punishments are somewhat higher . 
  the danish/swedish stereotype in a collection of stereotypes is always meant to represent the whole nordic countries . 
  so the stereotype will include lustful blondes , heavy metal , saunas , reindeer & santa claus , the northern lights , vikings , ikea furniture , poul henningsen lamps , meatballs , socialists , or whatever , but is meant to represent the whole region . 
  for some reason denmark or sweden is just picked as the country instead of nordic countries . 
  he dragged himself to the entrance of a nearby store and died in the entrance . 
  so it was a murder , and the juvenile had to sit in prison 3 years for the murder . 
  the most typical sentence for rape in finland is 0 years - the majority of offenders are not sentenced to prison for rape . 
  the sentences in u.s. seem so weird . 
  i mean , the median sentence for rape in finland is actually not 2 or 1 years , but 0 years , since only 1/3 of rapists are sentenced to prison . 
   just like no country on earth with nuclear weapons will be attacked ... . 
  there has been even at least two wars where ** both ** of the countries had nuclear weapons . 
  and 5 years is actually a long sentence for rape . 
  as a comparison a gypsy who had decided to stab a random person on the street was sentenced to 8 years , of which even that person will sit 1/2 , or to be more precise 1/3 because he was a juvenile . 
  so they must have used a lot of violence or the rape must have lasted for a long time . 
   intelligent tax system yes , it 's an intelligence tax system . 
  at least the 3 nordic wages were all true . 
  they do really have generally . 
  the north is always better than south in both subjective surveys and objective rankings such as rankings by corruption : https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/corruption_perceptions_index or press freedom : https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/press_freedom_index . 
  there could be more people in larger cities that are forced to live there because of studies and work , while people living in the countryside might typically do so because they really like it . 
  `` i-v '' is definitely the best system and should be used everywhere . 
  but names not based on the order perhaps gives some information about the life before , such as l\u00f6rdag being the bath day . 
  the month names in finnish are n't just named after some roman caesars and thus bear some information : november is for example the month of death . 
  it 's the same in finnish : are you germanic ? 
  are you finno-ugric ? 
  and this is my opinion weird , because you could think that these two words are so fundamental and often used that they would not change . 
  does this mean that she got a lot of personal votes even though the voters did n't know at all what kind of political opinions she have ? 
  mr was she positioned at the top of the list and did n't need to get any personal votes . 
  the system in norway and sweden is in my opinion btw weird because the political parties can always get some people chosen by placing them on the top . 
  in the finnish system there is no order and the candidates are chosen exclusively according to the amount of votes each candidate got . 
  eu subsidies are only 5 % of the romanian gdp , so they do n't matter . 
  they matter only , according to at least my logic , if the romanian state would not have spent money on something , because it feels it 's not worth it , but eu decide to spend money on it . 
  but in that case the romanian state could still have done the some thing very well , for example if these buildings were painted with eu money the state would still have afforded the painting . 
  the significance of those is over-exaggerated , since even at most a country gets $ 500 / year / inhabitant from eu . 
  that neighborhood looks better when walking in it , though . 
  but perhaps a bit too kitschy . 
  in architecture everything was better in the past , and this color scheme for example is perfect : http://www.vastavalo.fi/albums/userpics/13878/normal_dsc_0092_edit2.jpg each house has a different color , there is only one color in each house , but there may be 2 or 3 slightly different versions of it and the color is a pastel color . 
  the differently colored parts are very harmonous such as in the first building on the right side . 
  the starting point was better and the environment ok , but this house in helsinki ( in the worst area in the city ) started also to look way more interesting after a simple renovation : before : https://www.google.com/maps/@60.2156259,25.0817258,3a,75y,13.79h,91.15t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1slervtmoxhxkq8jt0hc6afa!2e0!7i13312!8i6656 after : http://www.hekaoy.fi/puotila/sites/puotila/files/styles/gallery-medium/public/kiinteisto/image-gallery/2013-11/korsholmantie9_puotila2.jpg?itok=fecax7tn i do n't understand why commie houses are n't painted and decorated more often . 
   calling for reunification with ... austria , and of course the recovery of silesia , pomerania , east prussia and the s\u00fcdtyrol are these some kind of taboos ? 
  i 'd assume that the latter is more efficient , since in the latter both will know all the words , unless you misunderstand the meaning of a word or pronounce it wrong , but in the first one there could be a word that the other person does know .

  when it comes down to reality they would only think of themselves , period . 
  finland is n't part of scandinavia and i was solely talking of the russian threat to finland . 
  norway/sweden/denmark are not in any kind of danger . 
  there are no guarantees that the us led nato would intervene . 
  no matter what kind of wibble wobble partner status finland currently has with nato , not a member means no protection . 
  ah the british - a never ending well of lols . 
  indeed it is but is also one of the reason euroskepticism is on the rise in finland and from what i gather in other smaller eu nations . 
  i 'd guess he got triggered by some keywords and went full retard . 
  from reading that i 'd wager he 's a ncp supporter . 
  - we are getting ran over by bigger countries in the eu that force their stupid shit on us even when it 's harmful for us but beneficial to them - germany and others are pushing eu into a federalized government as in united states of europe - refugee situation and handling - financial situation and decisions ( greece ) - eu expanding too fast - big countries using eu as a leverage in their political agenda instead of common good/consensus, 
  the drama queen act and temper tantrum of 70 million people screwed up ~ 500 million people and cost around 2,1 trllion usd in the markets . 
  do brits really think there would/should not be repercussions ? 
  and no , ignorance is no excuse . 
  you did not bother to study and research the subject you voted on ? 
  your politicians were deceitful , dishonest and lying . 
  politician doing that is news to you ? 
  for as long as i remember brits have wanted special treatment , opt-outs and entitlements in the eu . 
  considering how british meps and politicians have conducted themselves in the past towards their counterparts and colleagues - how much sympathy do you expect to get from . . well anyone ? 
  i 'm at the point where eu should kick the uk out of they do not leave , although it is sad and painful , because i 've had enough of the uk acting like a f ****** diva .

  there must be something i am missing or not understanding as that is simply insane . 
  was sad about 6 months ago but now . . good fucking riddance . 
  so the brits are n't the only ones with retarded ministers as of late . 
  glad to hear .

  funny thing is that in europe and in the eu it would be possible for our lovely mamacita to take over juncker 's position . 
  meanwhile in glorious sovjetski russkie ruled by rasputlin she 'd be arrested , beaten , judged , violated and executed . 
  lol russians ... 
  this shows how clueless russians are when it comes to europe , eu and it 's role and the role of it 's officials .

  i do n't understand why would anyone want to accept scotland into the eu if they break away from the uk . 
  they 're so similar to the english with their `` one foot inside and the other outside '' approach as was seen way before and after brexit .

  if you are actually comparing the act of smoking to drunk driving or speeding then you really are a troll or the dimmest arsebandit ever . 
  those are your choices . 
  i know my rights and my choices to advocate said rights . 
  what you conveniently ( out of stupidity or because it pretty much voids whatever argument you thought had ) left out was basically ignoring whatever the state is trying to enforce upon you - look up prohibition as an example . 
  i 'm sure you know what smokers in other countries or even in austria would do if nicotine treatment was cheap and easily available . 
  good job painting smokers lazy , especially austrian ones that you seem to have a deep understanding of . 
  a lot less prevalent yes but it still occurs at regular intervals . 
  your `` argument '' has zero merit and i 'll briefly try to explain it since you 're too moronic to understand it : you can not legislate human behaviour such as smoking or drinking . 
  idiots , most likely with a similar mindset as what you have , have tried it in the past and failed - majestically . 
  smoking is less socially acceptable than in the past and it has fuck all to do with legislation or regulations . 
  science/medicine have proven the dangers of smoking and the publicity/education of it is what 's reduced the amount of population that smoke . 
  not legislation . 
  what legislatures have done is make a cash cow of it , tax it as much as possible as it 's addictive and at the same reduce the measures available for people to break the addiction and habit . 
  really ? 
  `` few people '' ? 
  how stupid can you really be ? 
  it 's this kind of idiocy you write that really makes you look like a troll . 
  those `` few people '' will always be a percentage of a population . 
  since you clearly do not understand big numbers or complicated words i 'll try to be as clear as possible : `` few people '' are in reality a lot of individuals . 
  good luck policing and `` prosecuting '' even a slight portion of those , police has a lot more important things to do than writing tickets to smokers . 
  just because you have n't heard of x does n't mean x does n't occur , dumbshit . 
  ever watch a random customs/border control reality show on tv ? 
  drugs are sent by mail regularly . 
  thanks for the count . 
  i try to keep it between 10 and 5 so you can count them yet still keep it challenging for you . 
  a lot of smokers ( me included ) would stop . 
  this is the part your narrow mind does n't seem to understand . 
  not all but a lot more . 
  those who want to keep smoking then it 's their choice and their right to do so ? 
  you do n't like it ? 
  well too fucking bad - go in the corner and cry yourself to sleep . 
  making it illegal would ? 
  really ? 
  you 're either a troll or the dumbest fuckwad i have ever met online . 
  here 's a few other things that stopped because it 's illegal : - drunk driving - underage drinking - inflcting physical harm to others - tax fraud/evasion - theft - double parking - indecent public exposure also do tell - who would enforce this ? 
  the police ? 
  good luck , they have more important things to do . 
  some new random civil servant position ? 
  good luck finding funding and smokers actually giving a single fuck when some random comes to `` stop you from smoking '' . 
  you mean like how people drink alcohol to relax and in social encounters ? 
  it 's about breaking the habit you moronic knucklefuck and nicotine treatment does help with that . 
  my examples were to show how retarded the laws and regulations have been made so they actually prevent/discourage smokers from breaking the habit and quitting , you clueless spunktowel .

this is n't a bad idea . 
  iodine pills are cheap and extremely effective at reducing or almost eliminating harmful effects from almost any conceivable civilian nuclear accident , provided they are taken at a right time . 
  chernobyl , for example , very likely would n't have caused any health effects that would have been detectable in medical statistics if the population had been issued iodine pills in time . 
  do n't believe me or any other random internet stranger , look it up yourself from united nations reports ( unscear , who ) or from independent international committee for radiation protection ( icrp ) . 
  just remember , if there ever is a situation where you contemplate whether to take iodine pills : wait until actual experts say it 's time to take the pills . 
  taken too early or too late , they are ineffective . 
  so if you listen to internet scaremongers and start munching iodine pills the moment you hear there 's been some trouble at a nuclear power plant , you 're putting yourself at risk . 
  reddit is probably a bad representation , yes , but this is a very tricky question to poll , as the answer depends very much on how the question is phrased . 
  finns are fairly skeptical of nato - mostly because we doubt the great powers would actually help us if it came to that , and because russia is an important trading partner - but if the question is phrased `` do you support nato membership if finnish government considers it to be in the interests of finland , '' the support goes to about 50 % or even more . 
  we are generally fairly trusting ( rightly or wrongly ) about our government 's handling of foreign affairs , and if they say it 's time to join , i think most of the opposition would evaporate . 
  probably the most obvious is that since early 1960s , sweden has been under us nuclear umbrella and in time of war against the soviet block , would have practically joined nato command structure . 
  us and probably british bombers would have used swedish airfields to recover , refuel and possibly even rearm with nuclear weapons , while the sand-bottomed areas of the north sea outside gothenburg would have been used by us ballistic missile submarines to launch their missiles . 
  these top-secret security guarantees were signed in part as a deal to stop sweden from building its own nuclear weapons , and were revealed in the early 2000s if i recall correctly . 
  actually , i think i understand , and you 're not kidding . 
  it 's a damn shame there is genuine russophobia around . 
  but on the other hand , i can also understand why that might be so . 
  it 's only now that many western europeans are able to talk to germans without slandering them at every opportunity , and , well , even though the nazis were more evil in general , for millions in the eastern europe , the soviet and russian rule caused objectively more suffering and hardship for decades . 
  i would be very surprised if that did n't affect how people think about the russians , after all , the germans were so loathed for couple decades after the war it 's hard to imagine . 
  give us a couple of decades without this 20th-century `` russia stronk ! '', 
  bullying now emanating from the kremlinbots , and the past is forgotten and we can all be good friends , da ? 
  like i said , i know plenty of russians and find very little hateful in them , taken individually . 
  ( with the exception of when it 's ice hockey time . ), 
  by the way , both my grandfathers were wounded fighting against your guys and one of them lost all of his friends in the war as well . 
  neither hated any russians , only felt sorry for having to kill them and for them having `` leaders '' that did n't care the least about whether they died or not . 
  seems things have n't changed much in that regard , and that is most unfortunate :( . 
  sorry , nothing in english . 
  there must be something but these are things that seem to be rarely pondered in open english literature . 
  glory , national glory in particular , is hollow comfort at best and some of the worst excesses of humanity have been committed in pursuit of it . 
  i 've seen the balkans after the wars to the extent that i have very little illusions about what war does to people and to nations , and have absolutely no wish whatsoever to see anything similar happen here . 
  i really hope things down there are nowadays better than what they were around the turn of the century , when i spent some time there !, 
  precisely because i 'm not interested in glory or empty nationalism , i wrote only what is a fact : we , with some help from the germans , stopped the soviet attacks before they reached their goals in 1939-40 and in 1944 . 
  we did not `` win '' the wars in either case , particularly not if victory is defined as the victor imposing its will on the vanquished , or at least emerging unscathed from the fight . 
  but we `` won '' in a sense a small nation can win against a huge adversary : we prevented it from freely imposing its will upon us . 
  you are also absolutely correct in your suspicions : the soviets indeed had flexible aims , and that was the key reason our struggle had any meaning . 
  if the soviets had been hell-bent on subjugating finland , we would have been subjugated . 
  no question about it . 
  similarly , if putin or some other leader of russia wants to conquer finland , he can do so . 
  there will be blood , but he will succeed if that 's what he really wants . 
  ( of course , i do n't believe for a second he really wants that . ), 
  but last time around , we put up sufficiently good fight that the kremlin decided there are better ways to spend blood and material . 
  in 1944 , once the soviet assault had been fought to standstill and the participating armies mauled , the original target of the soviet thrust - kymi river basin , which would have opened the gates to helsinki and heartlands of finland - was abandoned , and reinforcements intended to exploit breakthrough in the finnish lines were sent against the germans . 
  and the fight was apparently sufficiently good that molotov and krutchev , among others , concluded that occupying finland after the war ( when it would have been easy ) would only result to soviet union gaining a `` bleeding pustule '' of little worth compared to blood and material the occupation would drain . 
  as for just how hard the fight was , well , there are many reminiscences . 
  but one thing that stuck with me the most was what i heard at my grandfather 's funeral : after ihantala , not one of his pre-war or army friends remained in the land of the living . 
  i 'm sure you do n't . 
  yeah , well . 
  it 's that china and us are n't issuing warnings for us about what policies we should follow - warnings that tend to imply they end with `` or else '' - nor i hear from canada or mexico at least that they 're considering reforming the warsaw pact to protect themselves against us aggression . 
  the russian military is not as strong as some people believe , but they 're not a trivial force either . 
  in some respects , they seem to have their act very well together - for example , in the use of rocket launcher batteries with uavs . 
   can you explain why ? 
  assuming that finland will stay neutral in case of war in baltic , why will russians want to start new war which will require hundreds of thousands of soldiers and thousands of equipment ? 
  the northern shore of gulf of finland is uncomfortably close to estonia , and finland would make a great staging area for air units in particular supporting nato reconquest of baltic countries . 
  furthermore , taking control of \u00c5land islands would greatly help the russians for preventing nato reinforcements reaching the baltics or finland . 
  finland has strong ties to estonia in particular , we are both eu members , and putin 's men have already practically said outright that they do not consider that finland could remain neutral in such a conflict . 
  they may very well be right . 
  so , in order to prevent finland forming a dangerous staging area for hostile forces , putin 's military is almost certainly planning a lightning takeover of parts of finland as well , should they have to go toe to toe with nato . 
  they would have to act rapidly , because negotiating for the use of territory or finnish neutrality would almost certainly signal even to the most thick-witted of finnish politician ( and we have plenty of those ) that now 's the time to sound the horn for general mobilization . 
  once that 's completed , attempts to take over finnish territory would indeed most probably result to bloodbath on both sides . 
  however , a lightning strike could , under some circumstances , succeed in establishing strong enough positions before finnish defence forces generate enough strength to prevent it , or dislodge the attackers without heavy casualties . 
  or , at least , putin & co might * believe * it might . 
  that 's the gist of the problem : what putin and russians believe , not what is objectively `` true '' in any sense . 
  we know they , for example , discount much of the finnish defence forces , whereas those of us who have been more involved with the said institution are actually fairly confident of our ability to do our part . 
  in many ways , our forces are currently better equipped and trained than at any time since 1944 ; but it does n't matter , unless russian leadership believes it as well . 
  edit : more . 
    putin 's military has also practiced this very operation in exercises in the karelian region bordering finland , where the stated objective of the exercise was `` securing the neutrality of a close neighboring country . '', 
   this is what military should do , prepare for war . 
  true enough , but the last time such exercises were held was in the 1980s . 
  that such exercises begin again now and continue , after the events in georgia and ukraine , is what 's disconcerting here . 
  there has also been a buildup of russian military forces in northern areas , with one full brigade of first-line troops activated near the finnish border , more equipment coming to leningrad military district , etc. 
  taken individually , these are not threatening ; taken together , with statements like the one that started this thread , and with increasingly hostile rhetoric in russian press , it is more ominous . 
  i 'm very happy with that . 
  in a fight against a foe 40 times your size , outright victory is not an option . 
  we know full well that we never could and never will be able to `` win '' a war against russia . 
  but for our purposes , coming close second may be good enough , and we define victory far more pragmatically : can we retain our independence and way of life even when it is threatened ? 
  the answer , both in 1940 and 1944 , was `` yes . '', 
  now i know that plenty of people claim that the soviet union never sought to annex finland or impose a communist government here . 
  unfortunately , these claims fare rather badly against a mount of both direct and circumstantial evidence . 
  for the former period , events in late 1940 and early 1941 - after the peace of moscow was signed but before the operation barbarossa began - provide very strong , albeit of course circumstantial , evidence that the soviet union was seeking to finish what it had started , and either annex finland outright or switch it to communist government ( and then probably annex us ) . 
  the pressure against finnish government was intense at the time , military maneuvers took place along the border ( and very nearly precipitated a general mobilization in finland ) , and there are fairly credible claims that molotov asked hitler for permission to `` finish '' finland during 1940 . 
  for 1944 , we even have written proof that the general attack that was ultimately stopped at tali and ihantala sought to practically annex finland if possible , although the soviets had to satisfy themselves with the secondary goal of knocking finland out from the war . 
  on 22nd june 1944 , when the attack was underway and proceeding well , the soviet foreign ministry sent its embassies copies of the proposed `` peace treaty '' between finland and the soviet union . 
  that treaty amounted to unconditional surrender and included clauses like ceding total control of all economic activities , printing presses , and even dance halls and other places of public gatherings to soviet personnel . 
  in short , it was very much similar to the treaties many other eastern european governments were forced to sign , once soviet troops had occupied their countries . 
  copies of these documents exist ( some were even captured by finns ) , and historians who have been able to do research in the kremlin archives say they are genuine - and reflect genuine soviet thoughts at the time . 
  i think it should be absolutely clear to any thinking person that had finland been forced to sign these documents , our lot would have been no better than that of hungary , say , and quite possibly the same as that of the baltics . 
  it was only after the soviet assault was halted about two weeks later - with some help from the germans , most importantly modern anti-tank weapons and a detachment from luftwaffe - and the front stabilized , when the peace negotiations began , from a completely different starting point . 
  the demands were still onerous , but no longer amounted to unconditional surrender . 
  finland had to take heed of soviet demands ( not that there was much doubt about that at any point ) , but was free to arrange her own affairs . 
  you are free to disagree if you wish , but i have very little doubt that `` the miracle at ihantala '' ( and subsequent victories in wilderness east of ilomantsi ) went a long way towards saving finland . 
  even since long before the second world war , the mission of the finnish defence forces has been extremely clear : to provide a deterrent that makes our total subjugation too expensive to attempt . 
  we never have and never will dream of `` victories '' in the sense great powers might do ; for us , victory means things like freedom to decide our affairs and lack of cattle cars driving our intelligensija to siberia or worse . 
  in this , very relevant sense , we won ; and i suggest making just about any comparison between once communist eastern european countries and finland if you are in doubt . 
  i mentioned this in the post , but to make this very clear : the greatest threat to finland right now comes from russia stirring up shit in the baltics . 
  i 'm enough a military man myself to understand some of the issues , and officers i trust have elaborated on this more , but the basic problem is that current russian doctrine and equipment practically requires them to `` secure '' the northern flank of their operation should they try any serious military maneuvers in baltic countries . 
  that northern flank includes our capital helsinki and 1/5th of our population , not to mention being our economic , political and social heartland . 
  putin 's military has also practiced this very operation in exercises in the karelian region bordering finland , where the stated objective of the exercise was `` securing the neutrality of a close neighboring country . '', 
  so this is not mere theoretical fearmongering , but a very credible threat should situation in the baltics deteriorate at some point . 
  as you noted , the baltics have substantial russian minorities , and putin 's government has already been fairly active in mischief-making there . 
  there is also a risk of finland being left out of nato and being used for a military adventure designed to distract russian attention from domestic woes . 
  for the last several years , the tone of voice in russian press discussing finland has been hardening ominously , with certifiable crackpots and putin 's stooges like johan b\u00e4ckman ( a finn who 's almost hilariously pro-putin , is employed by a think tank known to spout pro-putin propaganda , speaks russian fluently , and appears fairly often in russian press as a finnish `` expert '' ) being given umcomfortable amounts of credit .

  relative poverty measures social inclusion . 
  either by measuring income disparity or equality of opportunity . 
  poverty is very often a side effect of a high income disparity or bad opportunities , but it does n't have to be . 
  as an example , relative poverty can also be measured in different ways and one way is by gini-coefficient . 
  if you assume you can demonstrate poverty using gini you would get a wrong result , since a nice part of a city would still yield relative poverty even though those identified in the poorest group are actually middle class . 
  the problem here is that uninformed people might use relative poverty metrics synonymous with poverty . 
  this would lead to other types of fallacies such as confirmation bias , reporting bias and experimenter 's bias . 
  finnish defense is based on the notion of making war so expensive for an invader that they would never choose that option . 
  finnish defense is 100 % defensive warfare only . 
  we actually have a defense that meets this goal quite successfully even without nato help . 
  the goal in a situation of war is to protect , and make advances by the enemy problematic , wasteful and expensive in order to drive our leaders to sit down at the treaty table instead . 
  however , this does n't mean we do n't see the good sides in joining alliances . 
  a lot of people here in finland have started to favor a nato membership after recent intimidation from east . 
  the reason why we have n't so far is the perception by many that smaller nato members end up fighting in wars started by representatives of the bigger members , e.g. 
  bush triggering article 5 after 9/11 , or how erdogan was thinking of triggering it in 2012 are often used in nato-membership debating in finland .

  you 're voting for national policy in council elections ? 
  hate to break it to you , but the finnish immigration policy is not outlined by hankasalmi municipal council . 
  council elections are about questions close to you ; a new sport-field etc. 
  the true finns are losing voters because populism , surprise surprise , is n't very good at governing and the party is completely disorganised . 
  in my city , the true finns candidate that got the most votes in 2012 attended only a single council meeting . 
   eia identified a shipment of 1,278 pieces of teak costing 174,750 euros ( us$ 186,000 ) being used aboard the yacht . 
  this is interesting , because that 's not a lot of teak for a yacht that big at market price . 
  teak decking can easily cost $ 15-20k for 40-50 foot sailing boats , and this superyacht has hundreds of times larger deck surface compared to one of those . 
  so this yacht either only has minor details done in teak , or the teak was acquired x10 below market price . 
  if it 's the latter , they are completely right in raising suspicion .

  it 's whether you believe a government should act parent for the people or not . 
  in fact you can explain a lot of them with alcohol , but it 's not the only factor and the finnish murders it 's more about location . 
  most of these murders are male middle-aged friends drinking in one of their friends houses . 
  then a dispute arises that gradually grows the tensions for hours and ends with someone stabbing another at 5am . 
  in comparison , the british go to pubs and bars to drink with friends , meaning there are at least a few staffers that control the environment .

  there 's nobody sober to give you the lights of throw your sorry ass out if you misbehave . 
  but then again , what right do i have to tell another adult how they can spend their free time ? 
  of course . 
  every bank holds different currencies , but this is for the sake of risk management , not speculation . 
  they alter their holdings based on this risk exposure you speak off . 
  this is n't speculation . 
  these levels are adjusted every day as the risk changes . 
  what i am saying is that under the new regulation commercial banks are n't allowed to trade in pursuit of profit . 
  speculation is n't bad per se , speculation is an important factor in keeping markets liquid . 
  but the reasons banks are now banned from speculating is that it does n't make sense for commercial banks to bear this type of risk whatsoever . 
  this is because the funds they use are from actors with a very high risk aversion , i.e. 
  people and businesses who deposit money on a bank to make sure they can meet short term capital requirements . 
  this is why the banking and trading books have been separated with regulation . 
  it makes much more sense that institutions managing funds raised by actors who prefer a high level of risk in hope of a higher reward should bear this risk instead , i.e. 
  hedge funds . 
  that 's highly unlikely . 
  the rulebook for banks has more or less tripled since the crisis . 
  banks ca n't really hold speculative positions anymore since amendments to the basel ii ( .5 ) regulation right after the crisis and basel iii regulations which is currently being implemented up to 2019 . 
  banks nowadays have to hold quite a bit of capital as safeguard for all the risk they take . 
  banks have to keep their banking and trading books completely separate from each other , so banks ca n't hide speculative positions between these books anymore . 
  it also does n't make any sense that a bank who has recently been undergoing problems and thus in the spotlight would have any chance of hiding a big net speculative position in a currency . 
  in what world is this hypocritical ? 
   ukraine is ignoring the same law for dozens of thousands of its own citizens who enter and leave the country through eastern occupied areas . 
  samoyleva is russia , not ukrainian , they are thus not even under the same laws to begin with . 
  countries enforce different rules for their own because their nationals are their responsibility under international law whether they are harmless tourists or isis terrorists . 
  entering countries is not a matter of equality . 
  i can enter egypt much easier than an eqyptian can enter finland . 
  entering other countries is a privilege , especially if you know they are in conflict , not to mention conflict with your own country . 
  if you take the first flight to teheran today , you 'll have a harder time passing through borders of other countries due to the iranian stamp in your passport . 
  whether you agree with this policy is irrelevant . 
   but suddenly it must be implemented for the russian eurovision contestant . 
  it was already implemented . 
  we 're talking about enforcement . 
  you do n't ignore laws to appear in a different light . 
  you can choose not to pass a law in the first place , but after you 've passed it you can either enforce it or abolish it . 
  not to mention that ignoring this law , or abolishing it , would be very unfair to the thousands who have lost their innocent loved ones in the resulting conflict that is still going on today . 
  ebu inquired in december for ukraine to make special arrangements . 
  ukraine said they would n't . 
  this was well ahead of choosing samoyleva , it was a known risk .

  unlike other `` strongman leaders '' , erdogan has never been good at playing in the shadows . 
  erdogans moves are generally perfectly predictable , even if the means can be very surprising . 
  despite erdogan , turkey has n't become worse off . 
  the metrics that matter to the average mustafa have gone up , that 's a fact . 
  turkey has since 2011 had an exceptionally high gdp growth of 7 % / year on average . 
  that 's why people like erdogan . 
  but this exceptional growth trend has quite significantly gone down during 2016 .

  in fact our trade with them started to stagnate in 2012 , two years before the sanctions . 
  how so ? 
  nokia and it subcontractors were , and still are , a large part of our economy .

  yes . 
  in 2015 some russian professor dude said that after turning away from russia 's `` sun light '' finland is heading for national disaster . 
  i 'm sure the baltics are doing even worse . 
  the sanctions have been a marginal problem when compared to collapse of nokia 's phone business .

  no , the far-right movement in finland [ was banned in 1932 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lapua_movement ) . 
   safe landing i guess there was no black cat on-board . 
   considering poland was poor even before the war . 
  so was finland . 
  do n't worry , there are always going to be people making excuses . 
  wow and i thought our country had large regional differences . 
  so merkel wo n't mind if we take more debt to buy new fighter aircrafts ? 
  finland has both western and eastern influences . 
  eastern influences are , logically enough , stronger in eastern finland . 
  weird , how is for example \u00c5land eastern ? 
   well , finland does have a huge artillery , the biggest one in europe . 
  unfortunately most of our guns are old [ 122mm towed howitzers ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/equipment_of_the_finnish_army#field_artillery ) so while we may have the largest ( well the second largest ) artillery force in the europe it 's not very modern . 
  one could even say it 's obsolete . 
  we definitely need those new [ self-propelled howitzers ] ( https://corporalfrisk.com/2016/07/11/k9-thunder-a-korean-dog-with-bite/ ) . 
  would you like to buy a bridge ? 
  how many helsinkis there are ? 
  the number 8 is my favorite . 
  the winner looks fine , and she has a nice body , but honestly i have met imo more attractive black women . 
  genius !, 
  man poland you are popular !, 
   finns at the very least know how to control themselves . 
  our businessmen are so corrupt to the core due to the soviet era legacy , that even exposure to russia is like a ticking timebomb . 
  i think you are giving us too much credit . 
  from what i have dealt with our * `` experts of eastern trade '' * i would n't trust them if my life depended on it . 
  i think that the real difference between baltics and finland is that we are tied to a [ strong western anchor ] ( https://tilastokeskus.fi/til/ssij/2015/ssij_2015_2016-10-27_kat_001_en.html ) . 
   even more special place for mannerheim . 
  personally i wish people paid more attention to [ st\u00e5hlberg ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kaarlo_juho_st%c3%a5hlberg ) , totally underrated person imo . 
   we were n't animals unlike soviet troops and partisans . 
  we were n't angels either , unfortunately we have our share of skeletons in our closet . 
  hesburger is so out , friends & brgrs is in !, 
  so what is the hungary pig eating ? 
  beaches in northern russia ? 
  must be a nice place to swim and to play beach volleyball . 
   nobody really knows who we are , except our neighbours ( and most of them hate us ) i know the feeling , hey i 'm already sympathizing with you !, 
  foreign sounding names are not that uncommon in finland . 
  oh please do n't misunderstand me . 
  i have nothing against you , in fact the budapest looks kinda neat , but i just have no idea who you are . 
   because of common history probably - which would be interesting to find . 
  finland has a common history with sweden and russia and to a lesser extend with estonia . 
   because you can share the same customs or beliefs , food , etc. 
  - which would be interesting to find imho too you mean like [ pelimannis ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/spelman_ ( music \\ ) ) ? 
   and most generally imho - find someone that shares something with you . 
  we are happy with estonians and swedes , and maybe with russians . 
  i do n't feel anything towards hungarians . 
  again , why should anyone besides linguists care ? 
  what about estonians ? 
  why should anyone besides linguists care about this fact ? 
  so are german and iranian . 
  hungarians ? 
  stingy flag thieves ?

  for that hot currency drop and economic chaos ? 
  call an election . 
  labour back benches clearly want this already , which is why they want corbyn out . 
  with corbyn out labour would join the lib dems saying that they will ignore the earlier referendum . 
  and there we go , that election will be a de facto second referendum - ukip/tory for out , lib dem/labour for in . 
  corbyn just has to go before that really works . 
  we 'd definitely want london . 
  hell , my favorite city on the whole planet and i 've been to a great many by now . 
  nothing wrong with scotland either , especially with the cultural bonds with the nordic countries . 
   til : scots still feel like subjugated slaves . 
  you sound like this is ridiculous ( and i agree that it is ) , but majorities in england and wales just moaned about being subjugated slaves to brussels ... 
  yup , that is 100 % my impression of the battle around corbyn . 
  it 's all about labour wanting to remain and to have an election right now , but corbyn is kind of ok with what 's happening . 
  a lot of people seem to think it 's blairites going after him for being too left wing , but i 'm pretty sure it 's all about the brexit and a lot of people in labour feeling this is a great chance to get in government if they have an election this year as a second referendum on the eu . 
  the way it can work is this : 1 ) no one wants to step up to the conservative leadership and they decide to call an election 2 ) lib dems have already said they are remain . 
  labour probably would go `` remain '' as well . 
  tories would * love * to go remain , but kind of ca n't . 
  ukip obviously is for brexit . 
  3 ) second de facto referendum . 
  if labour + lim dems form a government , that 's a vote for remain . 
  this is the best way to democratically sort this out in my opinion , though uk * will * have burned considerable political clout with this . 
  still , in this scenario it can be massively thrown on the tories while saying basically that more sane people got voted in after that madness ( which is polite fiction - tories are n't particularly mad or labour particularly sane - but one that would work ) . 
  i actually do n't see how the uk could leave if that happened . 
  they can wuss out and call an election as a way out . 
  in which case one party has to bite the bullet and support brexit ( probably conservatives ) , allowing a labour/lib dem victory to kill this earlier vote by effectively making it a dual referendum . 
  and eu is perfectly within its rights ( well , there are no rights , only power , at this level of politics ) offering sweet deals to any area of uk that is willing to declare independence . 
  mainly thinking scotland here , but also ni . 
  of course there is . 
  farage , boris et al can be treated differently from lib dems and scots who like the eu . 
  the lib dems and scots can decline preferential treatment of course , but that 's their decision . 
   ontop of that , this goes against what jcj said about no negotiations before article 50 . 
  i think that was aimed at team brexit . 
  none wants to negotiate with them . 
  negotiating with others from the uk is fine . 
  they can get guarantees and an understanding which will allow the scottish exit from the uk to be debated on an informed base , rather than on hopes . 
  except she massively , massively fucked up with syria and brexit almost certainly would not have happened without it . 
  she has her good sides , but a great leader she most certainly is not . 
  just me aggressively disagreeing with his views . 
  i would actually have some respect for him for `` b '' . 
  i 'd just never vote for him . 
  which people know , but are still patriotic , which means that there 's a very easy and logical political move on the table : show some patriotism . 
  it 's an easy winner and the ones usually waving that flag are really not popular right now . 
  the fact he has n't could be caused by two things : a ) he 's an absolutely idiot b ) he finds patriotism so distasteful that even if he could move 5 % of the voting populace with it , he ca n't make himself do it both of these options would make me less likely to vote for him were i in the uk , and i would expect the natives to react similarly . 
  first of all - thanks for having a rational comment that , while it does n't agree with the circlejerk - adds significantly to the debate . 
  am i understanding you correctly when you 're saying basically it was an `` ethnic cleansing-off '' which turkey won , which means that turkey ended up committing genocide , but had ataturk not been around , it might have ended up going the other way with armenians cleansing `` their '' areas of turks ? 
  i have seen no proof to disprove this , nor do i consider it inconceivably unlikely . 
  any armenian mind swinging in with some responses ? 
  ( i think you should still apologize , but if what you say is true , so should armenia )  if any turk debates against this just frame them as barbarian turks . 
  some will , and i 'm sorry about that . 
  but seriously you 're the first one i 've seen trying to debate it . 
  the ones that wave flags and yell `` fuck germany '' are hard * not * to call barbarian turks if that 's what passes for `` debating '' among them . 
  historically speaking russia is a better ally than turkey . 
  hell , the modern west was essentially allied with russia for hundreds of years keeping islam back and then pushing it out of europe . 
  the fact that we did n't get along that well for the last 100 years is the exception , not the rule . 
  because erdogan seems to get angry pretty easily , though i imagine he cares more about things aimed at him than about things aimed at turkey ( if those two entities are still separate in his mind ) . 
  in any case it is exactly the sort of thing he deserved with his ridiculous `` do n't mock me '' nonsense . 
   incite people to racism what does this mean ? 
  if i say that i 'm not sure that people from all parts of the world share genetic abilities , am i inciting racism ? 
  if i make a joke about black guys having big dicks am i inciting racism ? 
  and since idiots have declared that islam is a race , presumably saying that it 's a load of bullshit is definitely inciting racism ( oh and the old testament is clearly bullshit as well , so i 'm also being antisemitic i suppose ) . 
   denying or grossly trivialising crimes against humanity , genocide or war crimes `` trivializing crimes against humanity '' ? 
  this seems like someone is going to jail for a holocaust joke !, 
  look at how far freedom has come ... and yes , that freedom of expression bit at the end is conciliatory , but i still find everything about this appalling . 
  only thing i would be for that if we 're at war with a someone ( isis , militant islam ) , preaching for the enemy need not be tolerated in our midst . 
  pretty sure you were n't allowed to play around in a ss uniform in london in 1942 either , and i do n't hold that against the brits . 
  hitchens was brits at their finest . 
  quite a loss . 
  yeah to me the telling bit is that even with this hindsight and the level of interest in the area , none has been able to say anything except `` well , the current way is wrong '' . 
  what 's the fucking right way ? 
  running it all from istanbul ? 
  no borders at all ? 
  i suppose that has been argued , but if you want to be a single state , do n't join losing sides in world wars . 
  anyway , if two countries now proposed to merge it 's not like anyone would really stop them . 
  hell , syria and egypt tried . 
  funny how that never actually happened . 
   did russia create a bunch of jealous little states and pit minorities against majorities in these states and arm them to the teeth ? 
  uh , in many places , yes ? 
  ( `` arm them to the teeth '' being subjective , but the soviets/russians have certainly given weapons to people ), 
   man , the `` christian world '' is not `` cornered '' in europe . 
  past tense dude . 
  europe looked to the seas because it got locked in a corner ( besides russia ) . 
  european history was massively impacted by the muslim empires , probably * still * more so than christian empires have impacted the middle east ( though it 's fair enough to say that we 're about to catch up and there 's nowhere in site for the pendulum to start going the other way ) . 
  threat of muslim invasion was probably * the * driving political reality from 750 to the second siege of vienna . 
  actual permanently occupying invasion risk from europe on the arab world was maybe 1700 to 1945 , less than a third of the time period . 
  none is saying things were handled perfectly , but they were handled the same way they were everywhere else in the world more or less , but the middle east is the greatest mess by a fair margin . 
  resource curse seems the most likely culprit , as other resource rich places tend to have issues too ( see : the congo ) . 
  well they did fail at solving the problem , but solving it would have been an absolutely incredible performance that none * even with the benefit of a century of hindsight * has figured out should have been done . 
  so it 's fair to say that while they did n't solve everything , blaming them for there not being peace in the middle east is ridiculous . 
  still patronizes them hell of a lot less than those who think that if eu and us should solve their issues for them . 
  or that they 're not responsible for their issues because - to include the subtext - the adults made the mess , and we 're sorry the children have to suffer from it . 
  and no true scotsman has ever done anything wrong . 
  germany did select its government . 
  sure , not half +1 of the total population , but that 's excuses . 
  nsdap was democratically elected and we feel perfectly fine judging them for that . 
  not even that excuses them . 
  history is perfectly capable of judging popular moves , and even withdrawing all sympathy from them in the context they occurred in ( though the latter is rare and has mainly been a big deal with the 20th century madnesses ), 
  perhaps . 
  but if erdogan wants to be our enemy as seems apparent , then hypocrisy stops being an issue . 
   is the urban rural split really bad in finland ? 
  it 's fairly bad really .

  i suspect that is a different angle from one being pursued by those making this argument . 
  that does n't surprise me at all . 
  just the tip . 
  ignore the shaft behind it . 
  and the huge guy behind it . 
  false . 
  article 5 does not say anything about `` defence '' . 
  it merely states that attack on one is attack on all . 
  like most post-ww2 us treaties , it 's well written to maximize their mobility in terms of policy without conflicting with the language of the treaty . 
  so they could just as well do nothing after a potential attack , and still be in compliance . 
  we 've seen this in turkey-greek war over cyprus . 
  `` sure , we view it as attack on us , but we choose to do nothing to respond , because we are a sovereign state and we are not bound to produce a specific response '' . 
  nato presents a specific tool of value to us , that being a tool of imperial force projection through territories of its allies and armies of its allies . 
  trump represents the old , pre-ww2 us isolationism to an extent , where us focuses on internal problems before external ones . 
  this would be a major policy reversal since ww2 , but it would not be anything new for us and its relations with the rest of the world . 
  pretty sure the moment it tries to stand up , it 's going to be put down by a hail of bullets . 
  as has happened before to every pan-european empire . 
  interesting . 
  certainly anecdotal , but it 's still a one data point . 
  i 'll look into this further when i have the time . 
  thanks for your time . 
  i can tell you one thing . 
  if there is going to be a european government , it 's going to preside over a small handful of states . 
  that 's a result of urbanisation . 
  that is rural folks moving to the urban centres . 
  and folks who have lived in said urban centres are moving to other countries . 
  urbanisation is a major element in essentially all modern europe . 
  but people from rural regions generally do not move abroad , but to the cities of the same country . 
  it 's the same in france , uk , sweden , finland , austria and so on . 
  pretty much everywhere . 
  that 's why i 'm asking if you have any detailed info that would dispute this widely documented status quo . 
  it would among other thing demonstrate that rural people are far more metropolitan than they have been in the past . 
  for those interested , there is a way to largely avoid it by blocking most of the addresses microsoft uses to collect this data on your firewall ( you can use firewall on your router , or you can install a free software firewall like comodo and add addresses to block list manually ) . 
  one of the most up to date lists can be found here : https://forums.untangle.com/web-filter/35894-blocking-windows-10-spying-telemetry.html there are quite a few others , found with a google search . 
  but you need to spend the effort on blocking these addresses , and keeping an eye for updates as microsoft usually adds new servers to collect spying data as old ones get blocked . 
  and if you think this is nothing , people have found chunks of microphone recordings and webcam recordings in the `` telemetry '' being sent to microsoft . 
  better not say anything suspicious or accidentally walk in front of your turned on laptop 's webcam naked . 
  most likely reasons is the rise of tourism , more efficient tax collection and turkey basically shooting itself in both feet over last year . 
  there 's also the fact that shipping industry is slowly rising again , and the fact that chinese are investing heavily into greece , and they 're paying taxes . 
  actually you do n't have to . 
  most of your debt at this point is basically zero cost debt that does n't need to be repaid for another 30 years or so . 
  it would make little sense to start repaying it early . 
  greece can also beat turkey when it comes to tourism popularity . 
  it 's two birds with one shot . 
  and considering how well turkey is shooting itself in all relevant extremities right now , i think you can expect even better tourist season for remainder of this year . 
  i 'll drink some tea to you getting back on your feet using this . 
   those nurses you 've mentioned as an example are exactly `` poorer people from rural areas '' . 
  so that 's what i find contradictory . 
  do you have some special information source in this regard ? 
  overwhelming majority of gasarbeiter nurses , construction workers , plumbers and other lower education specialists we had coming here ( including from poland , through ours are mostly from baltics and spain ) are city dwellers . 
  condom sales from all thee 17 year old females with sex drive of sex hungry pumas and who can bang young men without being looked at funny by society ? 
  can you imagine the money our societies would save on cosmetic surgery if all those 40 + ladies would just get refugee status instead of going under the knife ? 
  could you expand on what you find to be contradictory ? 
  i never stated that poorer people from rural areas are leaving . 
  i made it fairly clear above that those that are leaving are specialists from city dwelling lower middle class . 
  that 's why i listed things like nurses as examples . 
  these people do not earn enough to be able to fly back to country of origin easily , and they 're usually young enough to not have family back home holding them either . 
  so the result is that they leave in great numbers . 
  we 're seeing this across eastern europe , and it 's one of their great challenges as countries today . 
  on the second point , if young people who are still in the country are `` more right wing then their parents '' , then poland is truly shifting to the right hard . 
  it 's common that people start off being leftists , and slowly gravitate towards the right wing ideals as they mature . 
  partly true , but . 
  places like us usually avoid openly sponsoring such programs nowadays . 
  it 's bad pr . 
  they live it to commercial independent organisations . 
  russia appears to have kept things official , and that bit it in the ass here . 
  before someone goes `` but they 're all doping '' . 
  they are . 
  all of them . 
  you 're not going into olympics if you do n't . 
  the issue here is that state did n't just tacitly allow this as it happens in places like us , but actually sponsored the program . 
  you win . 
  your second point appears odd . 
  it hangs on the assumption that english would be vastly interested in holding on to thier union with scotland . 
  and yet , poor english do not appear to care about scotland all that much . 
  it 's the elite that want to keep it , as well as brutal realists ( i.e. 
  uk 's sole nuclear submarine port , etc ) . 
  i can understand the rest of your points , if i 'm thinking to have rosy `` we 're not going to leave regardless , politicians are on our side '' glasses on . 
  you could be right however . 
  we 'll see in a year or so . 
  your `` evidence '' is a shitty reddit post from `` badhistory '' reddit and a random site made by a man who has been dead for a while . 
  thanks for proving my point . 
  that said , it does say a lot about how you source your information . 
  makes sense considering what you commonly peddle . 
   because nazis rising to power democratically is a very common claim . 
  only among people like yourself . 
  even neo-nazis i know of do not warp history that much to peddle their propaganda . 
  the question list stands . 
  please do n't divert attention from them and answer them . 
   you 've got to be kidding me . 
  you mention the most surface , shallow elements of a culture . 
  religion is one of the most important and defining aspects of a people . 
  only for fanatically religious people . 
  in modern europe , your clothes will likely be more important than your religion for your culture . 
  most people in london will not care if you 're a buddhist , christian or atheist . 
  but they will care if your shoes are always dirty , and your hair looks unkempt . 
  same applies to people in paris , berlin , copenhagen , stockholm and helsinki . 
  again , you are projecting a completely different culture from across the ocean . 
   and , besides , the referendum was n't legally binding so they can sweep their asses with it if they want to and it 'd be still democracy no , that would be wiping one 's asses with democracy , and the nature of having a republic . 
  it would also be extremely destabilizing , as it would demonstrate to already heavily disgruntled populace that their democratic vote is not respected by governing elite .

  is it true that house of commons does not have a seat for all of its members , or is it just an urban legend ? 
  i do wonder what would the ombudsman 's offices reply be if someone would file a formal complaint . 
  yes or four naked males , full frontal , whatever floats your boat . 
  i found a reference where they say that it is one of the traditional ways of setting female statues in antiquity , a venus beautiful from behind . 
  there are five statues and the set 's name is work and future . 
  the female statue is called the future . 
  others are settler , intellectual work , faith and harvester .

  they could by our milk and cheese too and resell it to russia . 
  you have a river running through the city , hardly a venice ... 
  `` commie blocks '' :d, 
  for similar reasons we have residential areas that [ look like this ] ( http://www.sci.fi/~olvari/tampere/vesitorni/vesitornista.jpg ) . 
  do n't mind at all . 
  speeds varies much depending on where you live . 
  we are a country that is geographically large but has few people and is sparsely populated . 
  distances can be quite long , which is a challenge when talking about internet connections and that also brings our average speed down . 
  if you live in bigger city or town you can get quite fast internet connection but if not then your options are few . 
  for example i live in helsinki innercity so [ i have a fast connection ] ( http://www.speedtest.net/result/3674540058.png ) but my aunt lives in [ old residential area ] ( https://www.google.fi/maps/place/vapaala,+01650+vantaa/@60.2627568,24.8246624,15z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x468df6e20d217077:0xa00b553b98df260 ) not that far and she gets around 8mb/s . 
  however there is a government initiative that by 2015 a minimum 100mb/s network must be within 2km from 99 % of all finnish households . 
  it is up to the residents whether they want to connect to that network or not . 
   as are a lot of glasgow 's tower blocks . 
  why so ? 
  towers are usually categorised as structures not buildings in lists like this . 
  like / u/rafner said , that is insane !, 
  and the cost of relocating all those families on top of the building cost of your parliament ... 
  you should be careful what you wish for ... , 
  this is hands down the best ' x of europe ' list !, 
  thank you too for the answer .

  yes , that is right , it started to really expand in 1970 's , at least according history article at webpage of the ministry of social affairs and health and its administrative sector . 
  first steps for welfare state were taken in the 1920 's and 30 's but real expansion started late 1960 's and peaked 1980 's .

  it was removed when there was an overall overhaul of our tax code .

  although northern parts of finland are in the scandinavian peninsula the scandinavian countries usually mean denmark , norway and sweden , as our good / u/teacupdk said . 
  they even had an idea of a single scandinavian country in the mid 19th century but that fell through when sweden refused to help denmark in their war with germany . 
  we were not part of that scandinavism movement because at that time we were a grand duchy within russian empire .

  erroneous ?

  you and anyone that does n't agree with the opinion is as free to debate the issue . 
  well why not . 
  at least they have more reliable news on the bbc than euronews at least in my opinion . 
  i might be wrong , but limiting the broadcast to such a minor player as euronews is just weird . 
  which is precisely the problem . 
  it is clear that media in some countries are more biased than in others . 
  just look at russian media relating to the ukrainian crisis . 
  i mean it does n't take a rocket scientist to figure out that there are differences between countries when it comes to media as there are differences between countries on most issues , hence it should be measured . 
  bbc world, 
  their job is to tell the story from as many angles as possible . 
  if the information is provided to them from one perspective only they are to dig or find a source that tells the other side of the story . 
  sure enough . 
  but some countries have a more biased group of journalists than others and measuring this would be very interesting in deed . 
  that is kind of what i want to get at . 
  freedom of the press is secondary to the objectivity of the press in my opinion . 
  the `` best country '' should be the one with the most objective and free press . 
  well you can clearly read what i mean ca n't you . 
   freedom of the press only has value as long as the press is objective . 
  if the press uses its freedom to undermine objectivity and freedom of unbiased information it has no function . 
  if media takes a political stand be it on the left or on the right it is n't doing its job . 
  well if you want to play confused so be it . 
  both norway and switzerland as any other sovereign state outside the eu can decide themselves who they let in or not . 
  but as an eu member you can not stop immigration from one eu state if you are to follow the philosophy and idea behind the union you 're a member of . 
  the fact that opinions are made illegal and the expression of them is scary as hell . 
  no matter if i agree with your views you should still have the right to say them . 
  was thinking the same . 
  the press in sweden might be free but it 's very tainted by leftwing journalists and then we should ask the question how objective they are . 
  freedom of the press only has value as long as the press is objective . 
  if the press uses its freedom to undermine objectivity and freedom of unbiased information it has no function . 
  the whole concept of far-right is flawed . 
  if you look at national socialism it is very much to the left of the scale . 
  furthermore , the reason that `` far-right '' is on the rise in many nations across europe does n't mean that the parties are national socialist or fanatically nationalistic without socialism . 
  most of the parties labeled as the `` far-right '' by media are n't far right , they 're just conservative . 
  lobbyist is the key word here . 
  there 's no evidence on if it is good or bad as no one has ever exited the union . 
  most likely for a country like the uk it can only gain from not being part of it . 
  business in london 's financial district is so developed that it wo n't go anywhere as long as taxes are kept on a reasonable level . 
  furthermore financial instruments are just information and it will continue to move over borders as it has done before . 
  i 'd support a uk exit , hell i 'd like to see a swedish , finnish and danish exit too . 
  we do n't need the eu to conduct our business and the biggest importers of our products are in much our biggest importers so both parties have a mutual interest in keeping the trade free . 
  domestically we can allow free movement from specific nations as is done by norway and switzerland . 
  to be honest , people should know english by now and if they do n't they 'd better start cracking at it . 
  i can understand the older people however but the younger generation does n't have any excuses for not mastering english . 
  which one is the one that wants less eu powers ?

  * wink wink *  feel free to contact me when i missed greece becoming a global superpower or something , or at least when they manage to stop fucking everything up . 
  i 'm done here , you 're not worth the time and effort . 
  makes not to be passed down to my great great great grandkids so they can laugh at greece still being in the shitter . 
   you realize that greece is a land of endless beaches , un-touched nature and un-polluted land correct ? 
  that wo n't help you in the real world of paying your debts dumb ass . 
  besides the only thing of greek nature that is untouched are a few dusty hilltops and due to corruption you pollute everything around you . 
  [ heres a food example of you bs ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-25454100 ) , you have over a ** thousand ** illegal landfills and you call that unpolluted ? 
  my ass crack is cleaner than the whole country of greece . 
  i mean you 're so full of shit it is n't even funny . 
  the nordics are fully energy independent as a region and only use gas as an extra because it is fairly cheap and that amounts to about 10 % of the energy needs , other countries can do this as well if they want to . 
  so you 're once again completely of the wall wrong . 
  neither is greek corruption and the fact that it is a chronically failed state . 
  he 's complaining about greece having to pay interest rates and the fact is that every nation needs to pay interest on its loans . 
  he calls them profits which show a complete and utter lack of understanding of what interest rates are . 
  interest rates are a risk premium , they are the premium for when you do n't pay . 
  the higher risk of a borrower you are the higher the interest rate will be . 
  so for greece to get loans that do n't come with extremely high interest rates other countries need to guarantee these loans , meaning that if greece decides to not pay they will haver to pick up the tab . 
  the same way your parents might guarantee your first mortgage . 
  the question is n't if greece should or should not have defaulted in this specific discussion , it 's a separate one . 
  i 'm myself fairly sure that greece would have been better off if it defaulted and left the euro . 
  problem is that the emu member states did n't want this as it would hurt the euro as an idea more than actually hurt it ( at least that is my opinion ) , so to keep greece in the emu they had to do something and that was to bail them out . 
  by having the other states bailed greece out it gets access to cheap credit which it would not have had access to otherwise . 
  even with a greek exit from the emu they 'd still be a high risk country to invest in kicking up their interest rates and then people like the one above would complain even louder over profitable loans etc. 
  as they do n't know anything about economics to start with . 
  lol maybe i did . 
  thanks for sharing this information .

  they 'd be screaming islamophobia and racism all the time to the extent that all the pc politicians would n't dare to go against them . 
  you are right , i did a poor job explaining what i meant . 
  what i meant with enough countries was that enough countries would support it for the last one to accept because they do n't want to be `` that guy '' . 
  then again some countries feel very strongly about a turkish membership and that 's why i do n't see it ever happening . 
  apologies for my badly formulated sentence . 
  my experience from living in the us is that it varies a lot from state to state . 
  in the warmer climate states people have lemon or other citrus trees , further north they have apple trees etc. 
  herbs , tomatoes and such are grown quite much but not to the same extent as here in europe from what i 've seen . 
  then when you go down to new mexico , arizona and so on the climate is n't really as kind for growing most of the things we 'd have in our gardens . 
  used to live in nj and the irony of it being called the garden state is that people did n't have much more than a lawn with a fence . 
  some had a bush here and another there , but the gardens were n't much for gardens . 
  same here in finland . 
  it would be a total catastrophe if they joined . 
  bye bye to the eu over night . 
  not that i 'd complain if the eu disappeared and got replaced with a new union with fewer powers and fewer members . 
  turkey in the eu would be the final nail on the coffin . 
  turkey is first and foremost culturally too different to ever function in the union without conflict .

  like any newborn baby knows , if you ca n't see something , it does n't exist . 
   its also your fault your acting laxly with criminals so you can appear tolerant over muslims reputation . 
  that 's not the only reason for it . 
  the underlying problem is that our justice systems and other policies were developed to deal with populations of mostly secular westerners , and they work pretty well for that purpose , but very poorly when dealing with large dysfunctional multicultural enclaves . 
   furthermore , all adjectives used in the quran to refer to the houris can be applied to both females and males ( i.e. , `` splendid '' , `` pure '' , `` companions '' `` modest '' , `` wide-eyed '' , `` gazelle-eyed '' , and even `` large-breasted '' ) .

  one time , i was at a restaurant in brussels with an american colleague who had been very anxious to finally sample the local beer .

  once refugees are granted their residence permits , they are free to settle anywhere , just like other swedish residents . 
  what commonly happens is that when refugees have received their permits , the city has to * offer * them housing , and there simply is n't anything else available on short notice except the old run-down suburbs . 
  if you want public housing at a more attractive location , you usually have to be a student or be willing to queue for several years , since all of the bigger cities have a housing shortage . 
  [ here are some queue times for public housing ] ( http://www.gp.se/nyheter/goteborg/1.2307526-sa-lang-tid-tar-bostadskoandet ) in the more popular parts of gothenburg :  haga : 8 years  masthugget and kungsladug\u00e5rd : 6 years  majorna : 5,5 years  torpa : a little over 5 years  kaver\u00f6s , h\u00f6gsbo , bagareg\u00e5rden : almost 5 years  v\u00e4stra j\u00e4rnbrott , guldheden : a little over 4 years does this help understand why the city could n't simply `` send '' your relatives to a more central area ? 
   sweden 's attempt at taking in refugees is to essentially send them to isolated poor ghettos where the chances of making something out of yourself is low . 
  they are n't `` sent '' to ghettos . 
  they end up there because of the lack of affordable housing elsewhere .

  can finnair into nordic aviation group ? 
  let sweden take the other half , it 's only fair . 
  the cuts were closer to a third than a half of development aid , and mostly affected projects by finnish ngos and direct funding to countries like mozambique . 
  only a small part of development aid is spent on funding for refugee camps and other humanitarian aid . 
  it 's mainly for people with a medical condition that might attract unwanted attention : for example , psoriasis sufferers or people who 've had a mastectomy are allowed keep their swimsuits on . 
  foreign students are n't considered permanent residents . 
  foreigners with permanent residency are generally entitled to same benefits as finns . 
  it would be if they 're talking about income tax , but if employer contributions are included in the calculation , it might not be entirely outrageous . 
  finnish social security is based on residency , so it probably would n't be limited to citizens : / ( however , the current news is only about drawing up plans for an experiment about basic income : it 's nowhere near implementation yet . ), 
  most european countries already grant temporary residence permits to start with , sweden is an exception with permanent residence to syrians . 
  but most of the time the permits get renewed as a matter of course . 
  it 's not just politicians using this tactic . 
  many people do n't like to admit they were fooled , so it 's a convenient rationalization to say they could n't speak up earlier because of ` dumb nazis ' . 
  before : `` it 's silly to be concerned about so-called ` mass migration ' when there are hardly any immigrants in your country : it 's only xenophobia '' after : `` it 's silly to be concerned about mass migration when so many immigrants are already here : it 's only racism '', 
   again you have the free choice but also need to consider the consequences . 
  the opposing countries * are * considering the consequences of creating a permanent system of forced distribution of irregular migrants within eu , that 's why they 're rejecting it . 
  each of those approaches makes sense in its own context , but combining them under one union is bound to disappoint both types of expectations . 
   as soon as poland is $ 1 above the eu average and might have to pay more than they receive , they 'll become the worst eurosceptics ... sweden , denmark and finland are net contributors , and look at them : /, 
  planning to toss their tea into the harbor again ? 
    except the eu will not be sending them back  normally , you need a military and some logistical resources to do that . 
  let 's be honest , you dudes have no such resources . 
  with the exception of hungary , our resources are either sitting idle , helping funnel even more migrants into europe ( as they were during operation mare nostrum ) , or overseeing the migration from one eu country to another . 
  the issue is not lack of military spending .

   so , austerity for european citizens is mandatory but it comes to providing welfare for others ( i repeat , only 20 % syrians ) , rules are overlooked . 
  future historians will have a tough road ahead of them trying to make sense of all this . 
  from today 's article by johan hakelius on [ the same phenomenon ] ( http://www.aftonbladet.se/nyheter/kolumnister/johanhakelius/article21647404.ab ) :  positions which only a few months ago were considered to be close to the limits of decency are now in the center of the agreement between the six parties . 
  the approach is clear : the stream of refugees must be made to subside . 
  it 's not possible to go on like this much longer . 
   it is almost magical and very swedish . 
  suddenly the corridor swings . 
  what was suspect to say a month ago , is suddenly common sense in the middle of the opinion corridor . 
  in sweden , some mainstream journalists have admitted they contributed to suppressing debate about the problematic aspects of migration in the past . 
  for example , [ ann-charlotte marteus ] ( http://www.expressen.se/ledare/ann-charlotte-marteus/det-ar-jag-som-ar-asiktskorridoren/ ) : `` i helped build the corridor that has prevented a constructive debate on migration and integration '' ( * \u00c5siktskorridoren * or `` the opinion corridor '' is a swedish expression for the span of `` allowed '' opinions ), 
  and meanwhile asylum seekers are being flown from italy to sweden according to the earlier quota . 
  with a new quota , maybe you can fly them back out again ? 
  lol , this relocation scheme is such a farce . 
   we have absolutely different experience with nationalism here in europe what do you mean ` we ' , kemosabe ? 
  the simplest would be to expand the existing resettlement quotas for un refugees , instead of trying to create a parallel quota system for asylum seekers . 
  and how is that working out ? 
  they 're already over capacity in many things ( for housing , schools , teachers , processing of applications ... even mattresses ) , and there 's no way for them to suddenly stop accepting asylum seekers without legal changes . 
  it 's possible to disincentivize them , but that also takes some time to take effect . 
  many of the recent arrivals will also be looking to bring their families in . 
  by `` stepping up '' , do you mean create even more perverse incentives for people to smuggle themselves to europe ? 
  [ about that ... ] ( http://www.thelocal.se/20151016/isis-graffiti-scares-syrians-in-gothenburg )  jacob asmar and his family discovered the message `` convert or die '' scrawled on the walls of their pizzeria in red paint earlier this week .

  i do n't think those are deer keds - they just dive-bomb their victims instead of hovering around like that . 
  `` jalopeura '' was probably originally another name for moose , and got associated with lions through [ the constellation leo ] ( http://www.tieteessatapahtuu.fi/007/hakkinen.htm ) ( the linked article suggests that early finns saw it as a moose or a deer ) . 
  lots of asylum seekers and unregistered migrants passing through .

  germany [ passed asylum restrictions ] ( http://www.bamf.de/en/migration/asylfluechtlinge/asylverfahren/entwicklungasylrecht/asylkompromiss/asylkompromiss-node.html ) during the balkan crisis . 
   the goal of the 1993 amendment of the basic law aimed to continue to provide protection for foreigners who really are victims of political persecution , whilst preventing abuse of asylum . 
  it was needed because of the sharp increase in the number of asylum applicants , reaching almost 440,000 in the previous year . 
   when you get into bed with the germans ** for money ** . 
  that 's the worst of it , there was n't even any short term benefit . 
  finland will enforce the rules ( or what eu top cats claim `` the rules '' are at any given moment ) to its own detriment .

  the [ centre party ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/centre_party_ ( finland ) is also identified with the countryside and with localist politics , but their current politics are pretty closely aligned with the pro-business [ national coalition .

  you would n't even believe how little i enjoy parties . 
  absolutely hate them . 
  i can go down to a pub and have a drink with friends or alone and meet new ones , i can even have a nice sauna evening with my pals . 
  but as soon as someone makes up a random party and invites a heap of people ... uff , i do n't like . 
  i think it feels like forced socialising . 
  i sound awful i know . 
  i 'm trying to cut down on food expenses so dishes like this where i can make a huge amount in one go are great . 
  other great ones are all the different wok meals and they 're super easy to do . 
  gets down to below 5 $ / meal . 
  i could get it down another euro or even two but i like delicious food too much to suffer like that . 
  ideological old fart who has gone too deep into his own thoughts during his extensive time as a hermit . 
  i think most european countries do it just like this . 
  if by better you mean worse than anyone else sure !, 
  usa is best at running terrible elections . 
  jesus christ they elected the man from the apprentice to run their country . 
  was guy fieri unavailable ? 
  i do n't like to party ? 
  ireland had that turkey fella . 
  i loved that . 
  uk has also whisky . 
  and that stuff is often so so delicious . 
  people might like to discuss the elections with you and give condolences so if you start to become annoyed by that acting like a canadian might an option . 
  does this mean that when people grow up they start to love america and become right-wingers ? 
  i mean i have left-ish and right-ish views and i do not terribly like many things usa has but i do not hate them either . 
  america is a faulty state , just like every other state as well . 
  some of their politics do not work well with me but neither does our own . 
  americanization is a terrible thing and people who crave usa most often have some weird idea that they are some wonderland . 
  they end up shocked when they notice how some things we in europe have work better than theirs ( cough healthcare cough education cough cough ) . 
  [ exactly .

  is finnish brexit fixit ? 
  too . 
  early . 
  heard the first ones a few weeks ago and saw a store advertise xmas chocolates . 
  eu should limit the christmas season to two weeks max . 
  i dunno if i should continue breathing or not . 
  i only use credit cards when i 'm on a business travel . 
  and i try to pay the credit debt right away from the next salary . 
  that sounds wrong . 
  this explains a lot about the danes . 
  haha , you 're supposed to stop eating once you get to the plastic case . 
  makes no difference to us . 
  sure . 
  i think that goes for every nationality , not just the americans . 
  haha , really ? 
  why !, 
  that 's like 10 % of my childhood gone . 
  ah , that kinda makes sense now . 
  we do say `` january 1st '' but you could also say `` 1st of january '' . 
  both ways are just as common in finnish but then again word order does n't really make any difference in finnish though it might start to sound a bit poetic or weird if you use an odd order of words . 
  i think it 's what you grow accustomed to . 
  but even then si units make far more sense . 
  and minuses make perfect sense too . 
  what ? 
  i think kinder egg is a european thing . 
  no , it 's stupid . 
  here we pay our waiters fairly good salaries . 
  waiters fishing for tips are ridiculously annoying and money is a terrible motivator . 
  i 've been to many restaurants , some that had tipping system and some that did n't , and i so much more prefer that latter . 
  it 's supposed to be the restaurant owner 's job to pay their workers , not the customer 's !, 
  it should n't be on my conscience if the waiter is getting enough money to get by . 
  yeah i hate the way they show dates as well . 
  dates on the first 1/3 of every month is like an enigma i have to unravel . 
  `` did he convert the time for me or is it still on theirs ? '', 
  and in what logic states that the month needs to come first ? 
  i would understand if you started from the year and go down to months and days but starting `` in the middle '' of the date is so strange . 
  also , start using the si-units !, 
  they make sence , we do n't need to measure lengths with our feet anymore !, 
  also , and i 'm speaking to other countries about this as well , i ca n't get my head over how grown people fail to understand what time is 17:45 . 
  come to the 21st century and please use the 24h clock . 
  once in a while especially the delivery and dock workers ' union brings the entire country to it 's knees . 
  they are a small union but because they can stop all the transports in and out of the country as well as the domestic ones they have a huge leverage . 
  i hate them . 
  a lot . 
  another union that is known for having strikes is the paper industry union . 
  today most of the paper industry has been moved to other locations so this is n't as big of a deal anymore . 
  finland claimed independence dec 1917 . 
  so that 's the more common narrative from that era . 
  the independence was gained thru the revolutions that were ongoing in russia so wwi pretty much gave us independence . 
  some cities have fairly good intracity public transport , helsinki has the best by far thanks to the variety of transport vehicles ( mainly metro , commuter trains , trams and buses ) . 
  but because many cities like my hometown oulu are sparsely populated having an effective transport network is not cheap and people like to drive instead ( traffic jams are small-ish and last only a small amount of time ) . 
  inter-city transport is better the closer you are to southern finland . 
  tampere , turku and helsinki have moderately well working railway connections ( distances are a little under 200km between these three ) . 
  the main railroad goes thru the western side of finland , starting from helsinki and going via tampere , sein\u00e4joki and oulu north all the way to kemij\u00e4rvi . 
  the national railway corp. is a common target for ridicule , and especially the high-speed pendolino trains have had issues with our climate . 
  recently a cheap bus transport company has been able to benefit from this , offering very cheap trips in much the same routes as trains . 
  helsinki-vantaa is the main airport and has domestic connections to many of the larger towns . 
  by far the most popular is the connection to oulu which is far enough for the plane to be considerably faster ( 1h ) than a train ( 5-6h ) . 
  helsinki-vantaa is also considered one of the prime airports for connections from europe to east , and many european airlines and airline-alliances use it as their hub to east . 
  provocation successful . 
  but to take some more downvotes , the greeks are not without fault here . 
  they took advantage of many eu-supports , the notorious agricultural support to a patch of land that has nothing growing and a road going thru it . 
  someone cheated to gain that . 
  we celebrate easter with kids dressed as [ witches ] ( http://lh4.ggpht.com/_kkv_te_q4ze/s6z_dwtah_i/aaaaaaaagly/inf49eqvtgq/s1600/tiina%20005.jpg ) that go around houses and collect candy in exchange for decorated twigs . 
  finland was a monarchy for like the first 6 months of her independence in late 1910 's but the german king-to-be chose not to take the throne because of the outcome of ww1 and the possible harm having a german ruler would bring . 
  finland back then tried to tie itself heavily to germany to bring some security against russia and overall assistance for the young country still very much in disarray . 
  day starts with breakfast , for me it 's around 6am . 
  lunch is at around 11am , dinner at 5pm and a light supper is around 8pm . 
  i might add one small snack between lunch and dinner if i feel hungry . 
  to put it half-provokingly , they cheated about their economic health , stands to reason there might be other areas they practise same attitude .

  i agree that the finnish companies may have problems in they competitiveness and leadership ( and salesmanship ) , but i do n't see how changing the public sector could fix this problem . 
  also the old cold war are communists still support whatever russia does , out of habit . 
   other cultures do n't treat women as being equal or having the same rights . 
  probably because no one asked the opinion of the women in those cultures . 
  no , no it would n't . 
   cultural relativism could you just think that punishing child molesters is an innate part of european culture , and be relativistic about it , and let them europeans keep punishing ? 
  do n't meddle with their culture . 
   it 's not normal you know , for people to starve to death because government took away their food . 
  not even in soviet russia ? 
   not a nice guy , russians are right there . 
  i would guess most of the pre-wwii heroes were not nice guys . 
  well this is not an easy topic . 
  [ according to this poll ] ( http://www.hs.fi/kotimaa/a1396145259330 ) , support for nato membership increased from 18 % to 22 % , and opposition decreased from 64 % to 59 % , just from february to march in 2014 . 
  because of ukraina . 
  but [ according to this poll ] ( http://www.aamulehti.fi/kotimaa/1194894846425/artikkeli/iltalehti+nato-jasenyyden+kannatus+kasvanut+enemmisto+vastustaa+edelleen.html ) , 60 % would be ready to support the nato membership if the parliament + prime minister + president would support it first . 
  [ looks like ] ( http://www.uusisuomi.fi/kotimaa/69868-kokoomus-vaati-kansanaanestysta-natosta ) the whole party ( kokoomus ) is quite ready to start openly supporting nato membership . 
  we finns are pretty conformist . 
  for a long time , the accepted opinion was against nato . 
  but now if the largest party and the largest newspaper start to `` educate '' the general population that the `` accepted opinion '' has changed , maybe the people 's opinion will shift in the coming years . 
   confident enough in him to make him the face of the party he is the most popular politician in finland . 
  number 1 in personal votes ( [ 148 190 , out of total 1 728 294 ] ( http://vaalit.yle.fi/tulospalvelu/2014/eurovaalit/ehdokkaat_vertauslukujarjestyksessa.html ) ) in this year 's euro elections . 
  so they would have been stupid to choose a less popular face for the party . 
  * stubb is young and bold . 
  and very popular -- at least among the voters of his party . 
  he probably does n't care so much what older people think , and what the voters of other parties think . 
  * support for the political left ( social democratic party , left alliance ) is at a historic low , and probably will decrease further , so people on the right feel more confident in expressing their opinions . 
  * the recent event in ukraine maybe made some people to reconsider their opinion on nato . 
   no one else is reporting this . 
  and now that he is the prime minister , we can assume he will continue working towards that fine goal . 
  right wing , in the sense that they oppose eu and immigration , but center-leftist in their economic views . 
   after stalin 's death the baltics existed another 37 years under the su and that was n't exactly the worst place in the world . 
  it should be clear that the baltics would in any case have been better off without the soviet union . 
   stalin killed more than hitler but mao killed ( or caused deaths ) more than stalin . 
   the resources were sold off for next-to-nothing if something is sold for way below what it is worth , i would call that corruption , too . 
   yes , it 's the turks fault that corruption is the norm in romania . 
  well is the turks fault that corruption is the norm in turkey ? 
   it seems you have no knowledge of swedish whatsoever i am finnish ( the flair should give it out ) , i had 6 years of swedish at school . 
  i could write you this text in swedish , but then most other people in this subreddit would n't understand . 
  it 's difficult to compare to english , because english is all around , but at least definitely swedish was easier than german for me . 
  if you google [ ` language difficulty ranking ' ] ( https://www.google.fi/#q=language%20difficulty%20ranking ) or [ ` easiest languages to learn ' ] ( https://www.google.fi/#q=easiest+languages+to+learn ) all the results say swedish is easy . 
  maybe they are all wrong ? 
   studiemedel which is something like 1/3 grant and 2/3 loan he means the student benefit is something like 530 $ / month , but no-one wants to live under 1000 $ / month , so people need to take loan and/or get a part-time job . 
   swedish is a very hard language to learn bollocks . 
  it is [ categorizeg in the easiest class ] ( http://www.effectivelanguagelearning.com/language-guide/language-difficulty ) of languages to learn for native speakers of english . 
   how great their country is and how shitty everyone else 's is i try not to do that very much . 
  but in a lot of countries there is some adjusting we need to do in daily life : the apartments are cold , the windows leak , the indoors temperature fluctuates , the * shower water * temperature fluctuates or you run out of hot water alltogether , the streets and pavements are full of fractures , and there is garbage all over . 
  sometimes the mail carriers just lose mail , or deliver to a wrong box . 
  you should have asked advice in reddit . 
   why could n't we also vote like this ? 
  because a * very * important thing in voting is privacy : you can vote whoever you want , and nobody else must know what you , as an individual , voted . 
  and online voting systems can not provide this . 
  it is important to realize that our voting system was designed right after the civil war , and each party can observe that no other parties try any dirty business . 
  our system has stood the test of time , and when the election rooms close at 8pm , even though the votes are counted by hand , we usually know the results byu midnight . 
   here 's a map of the city circle line and [ here is a real map ] ( http://www.trm.dk/~/media/images/subpage%20article/cityringskorttilside.ashx ) . 
  and one of the `` idols '' ( joel ? ), 
  was convicted of assaulting a 14-year old boy , in a non-political context . 
  i think the activists in the document are similarly perverted . 
   the left only attack fascists in the document , the left attacked two migrant workers from slovakia , who were in sweden working as a contruction workers building a hospital . 
  i can only give a [ link in finnish ] ( http://www.mtv.fi/uutiset/rikos/artikkeli/naissyytetyn-karu-tarina-ei-ystavia-paivat-kuluivat-kotona-netissa/3401124 ) , but apparently she was a lonely , bitter misanthrope with mental problems and ** absolutely no right-wing connections ** . 
  or pretty much any connections at all . 
  for some reason this post [ in the swedish subreddit ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/sweden/comments/26j7a5/the_good_violence/ ) is being downvoted heavily . 
  i 'd like to understand why ? 
    democratize the economy . 
   what does that mean ? 
  it probably means socialism . 
  the voting population is more pro-eu than the non-voting population , so low turnover actually means less eurosceptic representatives in the parlament . 
  they should also ban the import of oil from some bad countries . 
   i 'm also pretty tired of the `` muslim is n't a race '' quip is scientologist a race ? 
  [ pkk ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kurdistan_workers%27_party ) you are from estonia , to you the communist flag is understandably a symbol of oppression . 
  but because of some funny history , for kurds the same flag is a symbol of protest against the oppressor . 
  normally it would not be ok at all , but in this context the communist flag is a symbol of protest agains the turkish ~ ~ f\u00fchrer ~ ~ prime minister erdo\u011fan , so i think they can be excused . 
  well , as long as erdo\u011fan is allowed to campaign there , it is only fair that the other side is allowed to voice their opinion , too . 
  unofrtunately it seems that in the coming europarlament elections , both the extreme right and the extreme left will gain more seats . 
  so [ this video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-moy8vuebk ) is not totally unfounded ? 
  ** tl ; dr ** in the 1970 's the police in iceland suspected a group of young people of two murders . 
  for almost a year , the police kept the suspects in solitary cells , interrogated them heavily , made them re-enact the crimes , tortured them maybe somewhat , until they got confessions . 
  in the light of modern forensic phychology , the police probably just managed to squeeze out false confessions , but the prolonged isolation and mental torture maybe managed to seed false memories , so that even today the suspects are not sure it they committed the murders or not . 
  currently , the iceland police can not decide if they should apologize , or just be quiet about this 40 years old mistrial . 
   deep fried heroin umm , what ? 
  maybe austria and estonia and other such countries , who have no problem letting africans drown , should provide ships and crew and take over the operation from italians ? 
   the sad part is that there are actually people who think like you in the world i just wonder how those `` eastern european conservatives '' feel about educated people continuously moving to the west . 
  if the east is such a superior place to be , why do so many people want to move out ? 
  the hat costs about 600 $ and the sword about 250 $ , and you use them about once in your life . 
  a lot of people just do n't buy them . 
   that is some bizarre stuff yes , but was not the point . 
  the point was , is that `` just rabid anti-semitism '' ? 
   i 've never seen a case of holocaust denial that was n't just rabid anti-semitism what about [ david cole ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwcojoj4rau ) ? 
   tens of thousands of swedish-speakers in finland about [ 5.4 % of population in finland speaks swedish ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/swedish-speaking_population_of_finland ) ( or about 290 000 ) , and about [ 4.5 % of population in sweden speaks finnish ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sweden_finns ) ( or about 426 000 ) .

  [ whataboutism ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/whataboutism ), 
   unfortunatelly for many people gypsy and romanian are synonyms . 
  maybe the country ( romania ) should change its name ? 
  i am kind of meaning this as a joke . 
  but , would it be that easy to get rid of the negative connotations ? 
   where europeans get the idea that there is systemic , `` extreme poverty '' in the us a mystery to me . 
  tv series ? 
   if you 're rich you can save or invest and you wo n't pay tax on that money but a rich person who saves all of their money , instead of spending it , would not -- theoretically -- have any higher quality of life than a poor person . 
  because they are not using their money , just saving it . 
   men to women ratio is lower than in the west you mean higher ?

  also during later stages of that battle , when soviets almost broke through the line , the last officer of his company , reserve lieutenant martti uosikkinen made a counter attack with only his messenger , got mortally wounded and as medics were taking him to dressing station where he later succumbed to his wounds , he said to his remaining men `` remember , kollaa will hold '' . 
  that quote essentially solidifies `` the spirit of winter war '' and the general perseverance of finns . 
  maybe russian military should invest in better navigation systems . 
  it seems that their planes , submarines , special forces and tanks get lost in their neighbors ' area all the time . 
  maybe they have forgotten to update their maps after the fall of russian empire ? 
  because they are the only superpower in the world with nukes , army and economy to cause unmeasurable damage on anyone they fancy to ruin ? 
  we were n't a colony , as swedes never really made settlements in finland , they rather formalized areas where finns were already living as cities . 
  also during the swedish reign finland was an integral part of swedish real , although ruled locally as was custom during feudalism . 
  after reign of gustavus adolphus there were n't even any finnish nobles left . 
  during russian rule we were autonomous grand-duchy under the czar in a real union , where we were granted all privileges of a sovereign nation except right to an army or right to sovereign foreign relations . 
  that 's also due the fact that a big part of finnish nationalism is being anti-russian , which is not the case with france or uk . 
  so funding true finns would be detrimental if their end goal was to weaken eu and at the same time bring finland closer to russia . 
  although , i do n't understand why they wo n't fund kepu , because they would gladly sell themselves for a pile of boards . 
  true , turkey should be challenged , but military measures are not the correct path imo , as that 's beyond eu and turkey , but a matter of nato, 
  would n't leaking turkish military intelligence be a bit questionable as both germany and turkey belong to the same alliance ? 
  indeed . 
  ancient finns believed that seers , called tiet\u00e4j\u00e4t ( literally `` knowers '' ) could change the world by possessing knowledge about world in form of poems and that knowledge could be made into a spell by singing it like in the video . 
  [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvxun84ktli ) is an example of a runolaulu , oldest form of music in finland , which basically were poems , spells and prayers sung with kantele music . 
  it was prevalent mostly in eastern finland , karelia and ( afaik ) estonia , but it 's not really practiced anymore . 
  [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17or2paj5cy ) on the other hand is not exclusively finnish form of music but it was the dominant form of folk music in western finland until the modern period . 
  and of course , [ the most well known example of finnish folk music . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4om1rqkpiji ), 
  ca n't really argue with that . 
  i guess we will have to see which way the pendulum swings . 
  that is true , but i 'd still refrain from comparing hypothetical future brussels administration to the long list of russian transgressions against our people from the times immemorial to common day . 
  hell , there is a significant change that eu wo n't even live to see 2020 . 
  there 's a chance , sure , but it 's up to them , not us . 
  kinda like we can hope that turkey suddenly transforms into a shining beacon of democracy , peace and human rights , although we both know it wo n't happen . 
  that 's because they do n't want it , as they as people enjoy their role as the villains . 
  because you are a southerner , russia is not , nor has ever truly been an existential threat to your nations sovereignty , your lives , your language , your culture and and your entire way of life . 
  just small things like these . 
  there was some hope for russia after the soviet union collapsed because of it 's own impossibility , but now with putin we are back in square one . 
   in the end the only difference between russia and a federal eu is that one of them hates gays . 
  that 's pretty unfair towards brussels , keeping in mind all the shit russia has put us through . 
  true , though i personally find it funny that mps in finland wear camo and reflective vests . 
  based on the board in the background i 'd say this picture is taken in some garrison , where these boys are just about to begin their conscription service , hence the hairstyle . 
  finnish mp use [ reflective vests ] ( https://www.google.fi/search?q=spolle&amp;espv=2&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=950&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewi3h6kiqsbrahwkpzokhasmckuq_auibigb#tbm=isch&amp;q=sotilaspoliisi+aseet&amp;imgrc=mygnxqs3ggip8m%3a ) while on guard duty . 
  i think that it 's good that troops , whose main purpose is to retain order stand out . 
  ours are called dogs . 
  as a whiskey and rum lover , tell me about it . 
  also that is just the official nationwide selection , on store level the selection is really limited . 
  for example , there is only one store within 30 km that sell blackbush . 
  oh i 'm so going to save this gem for a rainy day . 
  [ here is the selection of finland 's alcohol retail monopoly . 
  we have never been in the business of leveling cities though . 
  not even during continuation war when we were within range of st. petersburg . 
   conscripts in ** artillery ** ** units ** train moving their artillery / ** mortars ** to new positions a lot . 
  triggered also , one must mention that we are rather good at camouflaging our gear . 
  my instructor told us once how our amos squad in saber strike 15 was so well camouflaged that nato drones never found them . 
  social liberalism in this context . 
  not to be confused with classical liberalism , which is the one promoting free markets and such . 
  social liberalism is/was a important part of european workers ' parties , i.e left wing parties ' program . 
  do n't know about aldi but in spring 2015 lidl aired an ad campaign where the government had supposedly banned grilling with stasi-esque `` supervisors '' and all . 
  [ good stuff ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr2eue46pu ), 
  tbh , it 's harder to kill large amounts of people with knives or fists than with semi-automatic firearms . 
  then again , everyone was sterilizing their `` undesirables '' in the 90 's . 
  for example , sweden , the land of social progression did it until 1975 . 
  hell , in finland some hereditary diseases , like epilepsy and deaf-muteness prevented legal marriage until 1969 . 
  hello netherlands and sweden, 
  the thing is , you will always get in trouble by killing someone , provided that you get caught and even if you do n't , someone will investigate the killing sooner or later . 
  laws against hate speech , on the contrary , only apply in practice to famous people , like celebrities and politicians as well as media personnel , because people are actually interested on what they 've got to say . 
  a random bloke , like me or ( presumably ) you , can freely spout shit like `` jews are subhumans who need to be killed '' or `` lynching black people is a-ok '' . 
  sure , it can get us banned from the community in question but is not covered by the laws regulating free speech , but i highly doubt that police would be arsed to come knocking on our doors for occasional shitposting . 
  i 'm young , just off the military and without a proper profession , so in order to get teh moneys , i 'd need to be in a continuous employment for five months , bring peace to the middle east , cure cancer , remove poverty from the world and throw the one ring into mt doom . 
  i might not be a pro on sucking money out of the system but i do n't question why some would rather just cut all contacts with society and live as outcasts anymore . 
  one could also argue that you are allowed to say those things , you just * might * face legal consequence for saying those things . 
  at very least once and that was uk declaring war against finland * because * the soviet union , an extremely authoritarian dictatorship , ordered them to . 
  not a great precedence . 
  nah , it 's only about 14-20 kilos , atleast these used in finish defense forces were about that heavy . 
  a trained fireteam can haul hunreds of rounds in suprisingly small amount of time . 
  bah , light mortars are for pussies . 
  120 mm heavy mortars for the win . 
  [ was n't it the allies ? 
  ] ( https://www.economist.com/blogs/easternapproaches/2013/11/baltic-sea ), 
  granted i do n't have any first hand experience about the subject , but way i hear it , corporations fill their end-of-the-latter positions by cycling `` interns '' , so those positions rarely turn into careers . 
  also ,  you talk like these people will suddenly find some charity that will employ them , well guess what , that almost never happens . 
  no need to patronize me , i share your opinion on this matter . 
  that 's just how the wind is blowing . 
   it also means that the results do n't necessarily extrapolate outside finland , though fair enough , as i do n't believe our center-right coalition is trying to build some global utopia , rather than lower the costs of our welfare system and make shite jobs ( that are currently done either by immigrants or welfare slavery ) profitable again . 
   if you know something will maybe taken away for you ( because it is for example just research or a experiment ) you are more likely to prove that you are more productive than when you are sure you get the money no matter what . 
  on the other hand , current finnish benefit system is so draconian and vindictive that it absolutely discourages people from seeking work . 
  there have been cases of people losing their right to benefits overs receiving tips for playing guitar on the streets and what not . 
  so basically , unless you manage to land a job that pays substantially more than benefits , it 's not worth the risk and that 's what they are trying to fix with this ubi system . 
  shittiest part of being a singalist , right there .

  one day my lieutenant decided that we did n't actually need that goddamn cable . 
  after that my job went from running in the forest into tending fire places . 
  happy days . 
  `` working finnish defense forces comm cable '' . 
  : ddddddddddd, 
  for last two decades or so , there has been a strong political doctrine in play , called [ `` cheese slicer '' ] ( http://ultimathule.fi/5943-thickbox_default/ultima-thule-paakallojuustohoyla-poronsarvikahvalla.jpg ) politics , in which successive governments cut roughly equal slices of all public spending . 
  it 's a bit more complicated than that . 
  finland and the soviet regime were in war following the finnish civil war , so expeditions before 1920 were legally justifiable . 
  after the 1920 peace treaty the only major expedition was during the east-karelian uprising and all finnish troops involved were volunteers , so officially finnish state was not involved .

  this would in short term increase competetivness of italian exporters by decreasing real wages , but soon the country would be in the same situation where it was before . 
  the fact of the matter is that italy has multiple crisis that can only be solved with deep structural reforms : * demographic crisis due to low birth rate due to riged housing market . 
  as a young italian even if you have work , you wo n't get a bank loan if you do n't have capital already . 
  and if you have capital , building your own house or buying a house from an appartment building is prohibitively expensive . 
  * efficiency crisis as italian companies are not able to renew themselves and get rid of inefficient workers . 
  the reason why young people get only about 1000e wages whatever work they do is because they have to also pay for the elderly workers that are n't contributing , are n't needed , and compared to them have huge amount of perks and wages . 
  those are real problems and to solve them , you need real reforms , being out of the eurozone just provides a get out of jail card for a few years until the reality hits into face again . 
   i only have a narrow window into europe , so please correct me if i 'm ignorant . 
  i freely admit i probably am . 
  your opinion is spot on , atleast from my point of view . 
  thumbs up . 
   inflation is running now over 20 % in russia . 
  the situation is getting much worse . 
  there is no way we can predict that the rosatom could keep it promises . 
  putin is the man after all who controls the company : you are essentially speculating will russians have money to build that plant ? 
  i would say yes as even during the collapse of the soviet union , the state still kept its most strategically important agencies and companies running . 
  while the situation is bad now , it is a faraway from those days . 
  not to mention that when russian state has to select between the interest of its citizens vs. keeping up its international commitments , they easily select international commitments . 
  for example in 1998 russia defaulted its domestic bonds , but not its foreign denominated bonds that really took the international markets as a suprise . 
  well yes , but that is collateral damage . 
  we really ca n't demand from ukrainians or polish that they would think the convenience of other europeans when their countries are being under invasion and possible future occupation . 
  if the rest of europe wants to keep those pipelines working they need to help the countries in question . 
  the russians are offering the best deal , that is why . 
  originally fennovoima was considering selecting a plant supplied either by areva or toshiba . 
  however after e.on withdrew from the nordic markets , they lost a major financial backing and had to find new source of funding . 
  they first tried to get areva and toshiba to take part on funding the new plant , but then russians made an offer that they could not refuse . 
  the idea of blowing gas pipes is to ensure russia goes bankcrupt . 
  if there are no gas pipelines then russia ca n't deliver gas to europe and without the gas revenue from europe , the whole russian state will financially collapse and even after peace would come it would take years to build those pipelines back to work . 
   they should get that working first . 
  this new project is lobbyed hard from the kokoomus side and other parties are getting their share also . 
  but it is the most idiotic decision to buy russian nuclear plant regarding the future . 
  there are plenty of other more reliable nuclear companies . 
  i disagree ... * first of all teollisuuden voima ( olkiluoto ) and fennovoima are two different private companies . 
  the first one is having problems with the supplier areva on getting everything done . 
  the whole ordeal with areva and epr has been much more to do with project management than with actual technology or engineering . 
  thus there is no reason why fennovoima should be put to wait due to tvo and areva not knowing how to manage a big project . 
  * secondly while fennovoima plant will be delivered and build by rosatom , after the plant has been build it will be here in finland and can be put to use nuclear fuel from other suppliers than russia . 
  and while the political situation with eu and russia may go colder , this is a billion eur deal for rosatom , a signature deal that will allow them to export more nuclear power plants worldwide which is a priority for kremlin : to be able to export something else than commodities , preferably high technology . 
  * thirdly even if rosatom is a major owner with around 40 % ownership . 
  the nuclear plant is in finland under finnish jurisdiction . 
  the only thing that what rosatom will get out of that plant is dividends like any other owner . 
  in case of lobbying , i would say that majority of from national coalition party , from social democrats and from center party are behind increased building of nuclear power because it is paid by private companies and allows revival of the economy , especially in rural areas and towns . 
  yes and no . 
  yes in a sense that claiming that all muslims and all muslim communities around the globe are for this and will act so is very wrong and incorrect . 
  no in a sense that mentioned incidents and quotes were very real , however what they represent is the radical/extremist view and people holding those views should be cracked on as hard as possible . 
  ethnic and religious hate does n't have place in our modern world and those committing crimes based on ethnic or religious hate should be punished hard . 
  for example the kuwaiti political activist salwa al-mutairi should be slapped on schengen non-entry list , that is the least we can do , not to mention all other people who preach against common human rights . 
   good luck blockading anything today with many muslims in the west , global media communication and without understanding the reason for their anger ( and quite likely exacerbating it ) . 
  and then what ? 
  if muslim populations in the west cause trouble they can be shipped to temporary containment camps as the americans did to people with japanease background . 
   this is a local problem with global reach and it 's still a problem of a very small minority of the local population . 
  you do n't punish the whole group for the problems caused by a certain undercurrent . 
  i would not call ruling class of saudi-arabia and most of the population as a small minority . 
  the fact of the matter is that even as backwards the saudi leadership is , they are the more progressives in the country , it is the people who are resisting for example letting women to drive a car . 
  if the population would not be bend hell backwards on letting woman drive , they would drive . 
   the middle-east will never be what we 'd like it be , but we must understand first why it grew out of total insignificance to what it is today and also how we can combat it in such a way that moderate muslims do n't see us as a cause of collateral damage and suffering , but an active participant in an operation to help them get rid of this cancerous ideological current . 
  middle-east grew out of total insignificance due to oil and gas money . 
  take that money away and there is absolutely nothing left . 
  actually that is a major problem as when the day comes and for example saudi-arabia runs out of the money , there will be major starvation in the persian gulf . 
  the saudis are quickly running out of their fresh water reserves in a bid to have self sustained agriculture . 
  after they ran out of money , they wo n't anymore have any more fresh water resources nor can they keep up desalination plants running . 
  the miserable thing is that today there are 25 million saudis , in 2050 there will be 50 million saudis . 
  so when the day comes , there will be around 50 million people dying due to starvation and lack of water . 
  and no , they ca n't come up as refugees to europe . 
   i think it 's important to never forget that the first victims of salafism are all the other muslims and we must go out of our way to prevent the moderates from suffering even more by our own doing . 
  they must know we 're on their side and any indiscriminate bombing of a country or ( unsuccesful ) quarantinization of a whole group for the deeds of a few is not a solution . 
  look at quarantined gaza ... peaceful and jolly innit . 
  the moderates would do themselfes a favor if they had a moment of enlightment . 
  what needs to happen in the middle-east that middle classes have to renounce religion and have their french revolution where they will get rid of their ruling and religios classes . 
  that is the only way there will be a different future for the area . 
   salafism is a problem , but i do n't think mass wmd deployment , terraforming saudi arabia into a glass lake and killing many children 's families who have a lifetime to hate us is any solution . 
  it never was , is and will be . 
  okey , how about if we just blockade them ? 
  nothing comes out , nothing goes in ? 
  mine the borders , mine the persian gulf . 
  that is a humane solution . 
  so you have no problem at saudi 's and other gulf arabs financing global terrorism and jihad ? 
  i would say that the world would be a better place if few hundred nuclear weapons were pointed at saudi-arabia and every village and town in it would be destroyd for ever . 
  the reason why the salafists are brainwashing , why there is terrorism , is because of saudi-arabia . 
  the sooner they are destroyed the better . 
   why do you think the emmigrant countries would be more unstable if the people that does n't like the current regime stays home ? 
  i was n't talking about them , i was talking about the destination countries . 
  the destination countries become more unstable . 
   and even if they are less productive than some of us , they will still be magnitudes more productive than they are now . 
  seriously , we are talking of an average productivity increase of several thousand times what it was before leaving . 
  being less productive is not as big problem as not working at all . 
  the reason immigrants ca n't find jobs in developed world is because they do n't have the knowledge nor skills to contribute . 
  not to mention that you are only countring things in an individual level and not counting costs that the whole society has to pay in a long term : increased crime ; increase of unsafety ; eroding of laws and order ; troubled school system ; etc. . .  underclass ? 
  perhaps , but still a vast net gain to the world . 
  i believe you are overestimating the threat of destabilized western societies . 
  most could take in many times what they currently do without any problems whatsoever . 
  so increase of crime and social upheaval are just passing trends ? 
  just given more time and there will be no more sharia patrols or honour killins ? 
  the immigrants that arrived here will talk the local language , have same secular values , believe on education and are just as the locals ? 
  well , news for you , it is the second and third generation immigrant background youths that are flogging to fight with isis for setting up of caliphate and getting rid of everything else . 
   also , do n't forget that large parts of africa has been reached by the economic revolution and many countries are growing like mad . 
  there would be an end of immigrants because most will soon end up going to the major growth centra . 
  the problem is that there is hardly any change in cultural values . 
  for example nigeria is estimated to have population of 440 million inhabitans in the year 2050 while they currently have an estimated population of 160 million . 
  and this is just one country .

  the f-35 is just starting to shine .

  but the pm said that despite the law being poor it is still better to keep it in effect until a better law is prepared , and upheld it . 
  ** thirdly ** , the ukrainian law on language policy of 2012 was not a good law to begin with . 
  both the law and its illegal adoption were heavily criticized by relevant watchdogs , scholars , representatives of other minorities and ministeries as lopsided , substandard , and disproportionally favouring one language . 
  in 2012 the law was [ criticized ] ( http://www.uaba.org/resources/documents/blog%20docs/12-08-23%20amb%20vollebaek%20letter%20to%20ukrainian-am%20%20bar%20assoc_16%20aug.pdf ) by the osce high commissioner on national minorities as its * `` approach to language policy is deeply divisive and is likely to lead to future polarization of society . 
  indeed , the disproportionate favoring of the russian language , while also removing most incentives for learning or using ukrainian in large parts of the country , could potentially undermine ukraine 's very cohesion '' * . 
  he was also concerned that the legislation was not adopted in accordance with ukrainian constitutional and procedural law . 
  the council of europe stated ( [ 1 ] ( http://www.venice.coe.int/webforms/documents/?pdf=cdl-ref%282011%29001-e ) , [ 2 ] ( http://www.venice.coe.int/webforms/documents/?pdf=cdl%282011%29101-e ) ) that the legislation failed to provide a proper balance between the development and use of a state language as a unifying factor in society and the development and protection of minority languages in accordance with european standards . 
  the law was also criticized by ukrainian legal scholars , the national academy of sciences of ukraine and other academic institutions , and numerous ministeries within the yanukovych government as divisive and failing to protect the rights of all ukrainians irrespective of their ethnic background . 
  ** and finally ** , if repealing a poor law which has been heavily critized by human rights watchdogs and other relevant instances is touted as an example of a ` fascist ' policy the writers are really reaching for the bottom of the barrel for such examples . 
  the reality is that there are no examples of ` fascist ' policies on the new government actions nor on its program .

  they have done so by cynically fanning ethnic russian chauvinism towards crimean tatars and ethnic ukrainians , through manipulation of issues like the status of the russian language , nato , and an alleged tatar threat to `` slavs , '' in a deliberate effort to destabilize crimea , weaken ukraine , and prevent ukraine 's movement west into institutions like nato and the eu .

   we should find a solution with iran . 
  if the us could resist to israel 's bullshit there would be a way . 
  the pipeline project already exists : [ persian pipeline ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/persian_pipeline ) from iran to turkey to greece and forward . 
  but the project was halted due to iran trade sanctions , for example a swiss company already had a building contract with iran but dropped it when the us sanctions started 2010 . 
  we 'll see if there 's a project revival . 
  economically the project would look like a nobrainer but the geopolitics creates obstacles , and also russia would like to see it not happening . 
  there 's also a competing project : [ iran-iraq-syria pipeline ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/iran-iraq-syria_pipeline ) from iran and iraq to syria , lebanon and europe . 
  which of course is now impossible with the civil war . 
  another very intersting project is [ qatar-turkey pipeline ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/qatar-turkey_pipeline ) from quatar to turkey and european markets . 
  quatar originally proposed it to run through syria but assad refused it in order `` to protect the interests of [ its ] russian ally , which is europe 's top supplier of natural gas . '', 
  another proposed route is quatar , saudi-arabia , kuwait , iraq , turkey . 
  then there 's of course the [ nabucco pipeline ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nabucco_pipeline#alternative_projects ) which , despite being pronounced dead many times , still has at least some potential for a revival . 
  russia of course has been doing everything they can to kill it . 
   i really do n't understand russia 's fascination with an agreement that opposition parties signed , and which russia did not even dignify by signing as an observer at the time . 
  pro-russia nationalists marching in crimea and burning history books : https://news.pn/ru/public/94510 http://imgur.com/a/rcwd4 how about this self proclaimed ` people 's governor ' of donetsk - pavel gubarev and his [ russian national unity ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/russian_national_unity ) party : http://imgur.com/a/c80jd  russian national unity ( rnu ) or all-russian civic patriotic movement `` russian national unity '' ( russian : \u0412\u0441\u0435\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0439\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0435 \u043e\u0431\u0449\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u043f\u0430\u0442\u0440\u0438\u043e\u0442\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0435 \u0434\u0432\u0438\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 '' \u0420\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0435 \u041d\u0430\u0446\u0438\u043e\u043d\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u0415\u0434\u0438\u043d\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e '' ) , is a far right political party and paramilitary organization based in russia and operating in states with russian-speaking populations . 
  also wikileaks cables have some additional interesting tidbits about russia exporting ethnic russian chauvinism : [ the wikileaks cables that anticipated the russian invasion of crimea ] ( http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_world_/2014/03/01/the_wikileaks_cables_that_anticipated_the_russian_invasion_of_crimea.html )  however , nearly all contended that pro-russian forces in crimea , acting with funding and direction from moscow , have systematically attempted to increase communal tensions in crimea in the two years since the orange revolution . 
  they have done so by cynically fanning ethnic russian chauvinism towards crimean tatars and ethnic ukrainians , through manipulation of issues like the status of the russian language , nato , and an alleged tatar threat to `` slavs , '' in a deliberate effort to destabilize crimea , weaken ukraine , and prevent ukraine 's movement west into institutions like nato and the eu . 
  should n't stuff like that need to be accounted for if trying to get a bit of balance ? 
   and crimea is n't a precedent at all . 
  oh but it is a precedent to aspiring nuclear nations like iran and will certainly be reflected there . 
  in exchange of giving up its nuclear arsenal ukraine was given assurances of security and territorial integrity by russia , us and uk . 
  and look what 's happening to those assurances . 
  by the latest [ feb 8-18 opinion poll data by kyiv international institute of sociology ] ( http://translate.google.com/translate?sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;js=n&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=fi&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.kiis.com.ua%2f%3flang%3deng%26cat%3dreports&amp;act=url ) about 41 % of crimeans would support union with russia . 
  but i 'm sure any referendum conducted under occupation would be 110 % free and fair and show a huge majority support . 
  generally in ukraine support for uniting with russia has been on a long term downward trend , and it 's a minority opinion even among those ukrainians who identify as ethnic russians . 
  the support is strongest among the communist party and party of regions supporters . 
  and especially the correlation with age is very strong , and support is by far strongest among people over 55 , with very little support from the young . 
  regarding public opinions in crimea here 's some additional interesting tidbits : [ the wikileaks cables that anticipated the russian invasion of crimea ] ( http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_world_/2014/03/01/the_wikileaks_cables_that_anticipated_the_russian_invasion_of_crimea.html )  however , nearly all contended that pro-russian forces in crimea , acting with funding and direction from moscow , have systematically attempted to increase communal tensions in crimea in the two years since the orange revolution . 
  they have done so by cynically fanning ethnic russian chauvinism towards crimean tatars and ethnic ukrainians , through manipulation of issues like the status of the russian language , nato , and an alleged tatar threat to `` slavs , '' in a deliberate effort to destabilize crimea , weaken ukraine , and prevent ukraine 's movement west into institutions like nato and the eu . 
   first , even putin said that he does n't want crimea to join russia , so thats not gon na happen . 
  i agree with you that putin does not want to annex crimea , as that 's not the best outcome for russia . 
  but unfortunately it could happen even if it is n't his original goal nor the best outcome for anyone . 
  putin said a lot of bullshit but on this point i believe him . 
  russia annexing crimea does not make sense . 
  the region is fully dependend on energy , food and most importantly * water * from ukraine . 
  its important economic activity is tourism . 
  good luck running a tourist resort without water , food , and electricity - never mind how to keep the 1.97 million inhabitants supplied . 
  it would also have added political and ethnic instability , and in a way would be like importing maidan to russia . 
  putin does not want annexed or even independend crimea - both have huge risks of instability which is not what you want where your vital naval base is . 
  also upholding the budapest memorandum is in russia 's interests too - despite russia having breached it on many occasions the territorial integrity of ukraine would be best outcome also for them . 
  crimea is the bargaining chip here . 
  so what does putin want ? 
  he wants to be in position where he can dictate terms to ukraine regarding its western integration . 
  he also wants something much more than bilateral - to be in a position where also the west has to accept his terms . 
  from his pov ukraine simply can not start western integration without his terms included from the beginning . 
  all his previous efforts backfired . 
  on its own volition ukraine would not join putins club of dictators in customs union , and with the association agreement ukraine 's path towards western integration would get started without putin 's terms in it . 
  the whole project he had been running over a decade has crumbled ( and probably his future eurasian union plan ) . 
  and now all he has left is military invasion . 
  putin would rather have crimea remaining as autonomous part of ukraine . 
  but only with his terms . 
  and having invaded and occupied it he is in a better position to dictate his terms . 
  eventually his demands might look something like this : 0 . 
  crimea stays as autonomous part of ukraine , but with added locally established ethnic russian military bodies 1 . 
  russia 's military bases remain in crimea perhaps with new bases and additions such as the claimed bridge . 
  ukraine agrees to stay militarily non-aligned and never to join nato , perhaps with a guarantee from the west . 
  ukraine and the west agree never to deploy certain types of military systems on the ukrainian territory ( such as certain types of missiles , radars and anti-missile defences ) . 
  ukrainian defence forces are only allowed certain types and numbers of armament , and some types will be banned/restricted . 
  he wants ukraine and the west to agree to them . 
  for some terms a bilateral agreement with ukraine may not be enough and he wants it multipartial . 
  then he would stop the military invasion and withdraw his occupying troops and sign crimea back to ukraine . 
  his puppet pm in crimea is a fully disposable clown , and referendum is just for posture . 
  but the problem is : all this could happen only with very good diplomacy and negotiation . 
  and there 's a big possibility for the west , ukraine and russia to fuck this up . 
  then putin 's plan b is to keep it - not what he originally wanted and not the best outcome for anyone . 
  the data is bit old . 
  for example russia is not the top supplier of gas to the eu - norway is . 
  also quatar 's share has has been rising fast . 
  that is not to say that russia is n't important supplier - it is . 
  and probably also `` stop the war '' group - not sure what other explanation there is for this : [ fisking `` stop the war '' ] ( http://www.economist.com/blogs/blighty/2014/03/britain-and-ukraine ), 
  yep , one of the most profound divisions in ukraine regarding west/east alignment is * generational * and it 's very distinct in all relevant polls , for example in [ this graph ] ( http://i.imgur.com/turo7c9 ) it is also apparent in the latest [ feb 8-18 opinion poll data by kyiv international institute of sociology ] ( http://translate.google.com/translate?sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;js=n&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=fi&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.kiis.com.ua%2f%3flang%3deng%26cat%3dreports&amp;act=url ) . 
  generally in ukraine support for uniting with russia has been on a long term downward trend , and it 's a minority opinion even among those ukrainians who identify as ethnic russians .

if they try to force it like that , the whole thing will be a mess and eastern europe will just not abide by it . 
  it can have huge consequences for eu . 
  then these guys wonder , hmmm why is the right wing winning ? 
  yeah , i wonder . 
  btw , when is the election there ? 
  they squeak out something occasionally but many think that they did n't oppose the refugee flow enough last september so their following dropped . 
  i think it needs unanimous approval to pass so i would n't worry too much . 
  bottom line is that the proposal is just lunatic , no sane person would come up with something like that after all this . 
  the whole plan reeks of lunacy , i ca n't but wonder how the heck did they come up with this and expect it to pass ? 
  it would basically make the migration from middle east and africa more or less permanent thing . 
  besides it 's not even work based immigration but welfare based . 
  i honestly felt physically bad when i read the document for the first time today but thank god that the v4 is here . 
  it would basically make the migration flow permanent more or less , completely lunatic proposal that makes my skin crawl . 
  what the hell are they thinking in the commission ? 
  this will just break eu even more and brits are also voting for brexit soon . 
  facepalm for the whole thing . 
  indeed , my government is way too shitty to even dare to question eu so the best thing we can do is hope that other countries will take care of it , as bad as it sounds but that 's the situation . 
  indeed , he does n't even need to lift a finger when eu commission is wrecking the whole thing by themselves . 
  slovakian interior minister put it well when he said this proposal `` is not from this world '' i can almost say this proposal wo n't pass , it 's just way too much and not only v4 will oppose it too , but other countries also . 
  do they honestly think that those proposals will be accepted by the majority ? 
  i really hope they wo n't be , some of the stuff there just reeks of lunacy . 
  edit : slovakian interior minister reportedly said that the proposals are `` out of this world '' and poland said that they will never agree to these . 
  i read that the visa free system will have some mechanism to end it relatively quickly if turkey stops complying or something . 
  i also remember reading that huge spike of asylum applicants from a country with visa free access to eu can result in ending the visa free system . 
  they just interviewed the head of the asylum branch of our migration agency and that 's the message he gave . 
  a lot of the times their word is the only thing that is being evaluated , they do n't need any physical proof , of course it would help but it 's not required . 
  so it comes up to who can make up the best story . 
  pretty well said right here . 
  the pack mentality is also super scary when you have these groups of 5-20 people roaming the streets at night . 
  they have started to condition the population to the upcoming ground invasion in syria . 
  when us went to iraq the media kept telling that they have the nukes and how evil they are , and in the end there was nothing . 
  a stupid war in every way and you see some of the republican politicians defending it in the debates which is absolutely disgusting . 
  even trump said the whole thing was farce that should have never happened . 
  did n't blair play a big role in going into iraq for uk 's part ? 
  today iraq is more or less ruined thanks to the one of the worst decisions in us history . 
  if the west goes to syria , we 'll have another iraq for the next 20-30 years . 
  what a waste . 
  maybe it 's time to stop the forced regime changes in the middle east . 
  is n't the italy-france border already more or less closed , like are n't they returning migrants , who try to cross to france , to italy ? 
  i think this is the case , there was even a documentary about it . 
  technically they could impose visas then but i do n't think it 's something that they would really want to do as it would negatively affect tourism . 
  also if they did it , it would work other way too and visas would be imposed on them . 
  the economy is in ruins and they seem to be keen on taking more welfare tourists . 
  to be honest , i have no idea what the hell they are doing . 
  basically we 're more or less on the road to becoming sweden 2.0 but without the good economy . 
  one would think the bad economy would end the welfare tourist circus but no . 
  i am already planning on getting the hell out of here as it does ' t seem to be getting any better . 
  the treaty does n't say though that `` anyone can go anywhere to do anything '' , they can be denied on the basis of coming from a safe 3rd country or on the basis that safe relocation was possible in the country they escaped from . 
  i think tsipras also stopped putting these people in camps like the old government did . 
  basically that new `` humane '' policy and merkel 's invitation busted the gates wide open . 
  thank god the balcan route is now closed . 
  believe me , i would leave the union if it was up to me . 
  trust me . 
  however , realistically my country would be one of the last ones to turn off the lights . 
  fact is that the burden sharing will never be implemented because most of the countries do n't want them anymore so you would end up with 3 countries willing to take any , it does n't work like that . 
  besides we took more asylum applications than you so i would n't criticize . 
  this country is quite generous when it comes to asylum seekers . 
  everything is provided from housing to life long welfare , it 's like the dream of a welfare tourist . 
  and yes i know finns have mongol ancestors but i am not quite sure how it 's related to this at all . 
  i doubt the fyrom would be in that alone . 
  the whole scenario is just so stupid and it wo n't happen , tsipras is probably one of the most cowardly politicians who ca n't do anything properly . 
  the guy is a commie joke for god 's sake . 
  greece will never do that . 
  more likely option is that the route will shift to some other countries , but they will never deliberately destroy the fence . 
  i am sure it will happen , the commie tsipras will tear down the fence and push them forward . 
  sure , absolutely . 
  you are such a smart guy . 
  greece is in the shitter already , you are too weak to do anything but bus them forward so calm down . 
  our media told me last september that there are many highly trained people there like nuclear engineers and doctors . 
  does n't greece want these geniuses , or are you implying that the media lied ?!?!, 
  how could they do that !? 
  think of those women and children in the news photos even though 80 % men !, 
  gosh . 
  well the law says you have to register them , but that 's why eu is a joke , the laws are always applied selectively . 
  sharing the burden is probably one of the stupidest things as it creates a new pull factor when they know they get to go forward from greece . 
  turkey is gaming you so hard and tsipras just speaks about solidarity and some crap , what a fucking clown . 
  i do n't really care if my country takes like 3k syrians if they are properly vetted and not all young men , but it does n't really solve anything as the whole world is knocking the door now . 
  the balkan route closure is an extremely good thing as they ca n't be waved out like before . 
  you have n't really registered them either to be honest , last time it was because `` the system had some bugs '' the greek government 's stance has consistently been to `` share '' the burden which would mean that the flow would never stop . 
  according to the dublin they have to be registered in greece anyway and according to the refugee convention they can be turned back because they come from safe third country so macedonia and turn them back at the border . 
  only illegal thing here is what greece is doing . 
  do n't worry though . 
  you do n't need to stop them , macedonia and v4 will take care of that . 
  i do n't care what you do with them , build mansions for all of them if you want . 
  the waiving through is now basically stopped as it should be , greece ca n't no longer act as a travel agency and push them forward . 
  greece is getting many nuclear engineers and doctors though . 
  like a few weeks ago some greeks were telling how well they are doing with the migrants and how everything is fine . 
  that was the time when they were just waving them through , apparently it is n't well anymore . 
  if it 's a decent university i do n't see why it would n't be recognized . 
  i am not sure if duolingo has dutch , but you should check if it does as i am on phone atm . 
  maybe you should try picking dutch as a minor or just picking courses from it if possible . 
  i self studied chinese for about a year and then started taking courses and i am doing relatively well . 
  one option is just to buy a dutch course book and work those through by yourself . 
  how you 'd fare on the job market depends a lot on what you study . 
  many countries have lists for needed professionals like for example in denmark it 's easier for a computer scientist to get a residence permit etc. 
  i am not sure whether netherlands has this but you should check them out . 
  you should also consider going for exchange there during your study in the us . 
  i think you 'll be fine , there 's always some way . 
  dutch is n't too hard language for english speaker to learn . 
  we got 32k already , more per capita than germany , they came through sweden .

  i think it 's because they do n't live that high up in the north ... and generally have everything easier than we do in here in the cold dark gloomy finland . 
  ~ ~ ... or the danish ones , there 's some very very very attractive danish girls around there , somewhere . 
  i 've seen them , they exist !, 
  it 's not just a fantasy , i 'm sure . ~ ~ personally i have somewhat of a fantasy of denmark being a land of beautiful women . 
  now since i 've only seen some pictures of danish women , which has led me to fantasize denmark as a land of beautiful women , i ca n't be completely sure myself if this is just a fantasy of mine . 
  also , i have absolutely no idea where exactly those beautiful danish women reside , except somewhere in denmark , and i can not be absolutely certain that anyone else has seen pictures of beautiful danish women or knows of their whereabouts , i have to only comfort myself with the fact that as a man in control of his faculties i can be certain of myself and my belief that there are beautiful women in denmark and that there are so many beautiful women in there , that for me personally denmark is a land of beautiful women even if i could never verify my beliefs to have an absolute certainty . 
  but yeah , the americans probably do want them swedish girls . 
  ** edit : ** and yeah , i really do sincerely mean that i 've seen some very attractive danish girls . 
  it is true . 
  i 'm finnish , hey , we do n't even have the basic idea of how sarcasm works , have some credit . 
  ** edit2 : ** just to be really super sure to be on the safe side , rephrased the original message ** edit3 : ** ok now i 'm just confused . 
  am i not in the right in saying that there are beautiful women in denmark ? 
  good god !, 
  you do n't talk to the driver !, 
  not ever !, 
  he 's * busy driving * !, 
  a\u0144d our grannies are * busy riding the bus * . 
  that monster !, 
  both have very good advantages in deterring any invaders if employed the right way.there 's nothing quite as frightening as an inter-continental ballistic swedish b\u00f6g . 
  what happened was that they needed about that much territory to bury their dead . 
  they won a massive graveyard . 
  so hooray , i guess ? 
   finland is still mostly forest and lakes . 
  and bogs , do n't forget the bogs . 
  40 % of the country is pretty much more or less boggy ... good luck with them tanks on swampland ... 
  not denying that . 
  the important word here is ** ` originated ' ** , people seem to be missing that completely , but that 's ok . edit : [ vikings ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vikings ) , on wikipedia just check it out, 
  yea , there 's a lot more that could be covered in finland 's history lessons on estonia , a lot that was n't talked about or written down too well , or even erased exactly because of the soviets . 
  eh , give or take , i 'd say northern estonians raided vikings , same as finns , pretty much everyone around the baltic sea raided each other one time or another , by boats , and had a culture with similar elements . 
  does n't make them ( or us ) vikings . 
  however , there is a good chance that vikings established a trading post and permanent residence in northern estonia . 
  i 'm not contesting this at all . 
  well yeah , that explains it . 
  i wondered if the reason might be soviets , but since our general history does n't even cover swedish empire that well let alone where they occupied . 
  historically a swedish minority in estonia does make a lot of sense . 
  hm , i do n't know to what extent estonians might consider themselves as nordic , but here 's a handy and memorable rule concerning the whole nordic-or-scandinavian - thing : ** scandinavians are people belonging to the countries in which you find the areas from where the vikings originated . 
  ** finland ? 
  out . 
  estonia ? 
  sorry , no . 
  iceland ? 
  out . 
  definitely not . 
  norway ? 
  most definitely . 
  yes . 
  sweden ? 
  damn right . 
  ** nordic countries , however , are the countries that have the most direct descendants of the vikings culturally , linguistically and genetically . 
  ** and so because we have a relatively large swedish population here in finland , cultural influences from sweden since the middle ages and quite a few family lines mixing up between sweden and finland , you can count us in . 
  estonia ? 
  not so much , estonia had an important trading hub in tallinn as a part of the hanseatic league , and northern estonia was incorporated into the swedish empire in the 16th century , ~ ~ but for one reason or another it seems that a major swedish speaking population never settled in that well in estonia . ~ ~ ... or to be more precise , swedish influences on estonian culture was erased almost completely under the oppression of the soviet union . 
  also as a rule of thumb you could say that the major difference between baltic countries and nordic countries is in which empire 's sphere of influence the countries and their population has belonged longer . 
  swedish empire ? 
  that 's nordic countries . 
  russian empire ? 
  that 's the baltic countries . 
  you might also want to note that speeding tickets are not scaled in sweden . 
  the crime has to be more severe . 
  causing an accident will give you fines scaled on income , speeding does n't . 
  i 'm not quite sure how it goes in other nordic countries , or austria , or switzerland , but i 'd expect that if they had our system , there already would have been news about these massive fines from those countries . 
  our rich people endangering traffic this way is a relatively new phenomenon . 
  it used to be amusement for the middle class and the poor ( that 's why we have relatively many rally and f1 drivers ) . 
  ok , the rubber cop , is not a finnish rubber cop . 
  our rubber cops wear a darker blue . 
  finland still not part of scandinavia . 
  we are however , part of the [ nordic countries ] ( http://www.norden.org/en/nordic-council-of-ministers ) believe it or not , there 's a difference . 
  speeding tickets in sweden are n't scaled based on income , causing a traffic accident is . 
  police in picture not wearing a finnish police uniform , not a finnish officer . 
  of course they 're not going to listen to it , most of them have already buggered off to syria out of reach of yle broadcasts . 
  the program is hardly meant for the 10 000 or so people here in finland who have arabic as their native language , but i wonder if they would appreciate if parts of the text would actually be read in arabic . 
  ... i do n't know ... there 's a lot of different kinds of societies a finn might find acceptable to live in ... half of the time we live in the woods in the middle of nowhere , with no running water , kill bears with our bare hands and eat raw fish . 
  and the bear . 
  and some random moose we just punched . 
  raw . 
  edit : o yea , and we use moss as toilet paper , just trust me on this , i 'm a finn , we have no sense of humor . 
  it 's read from front to back . 
  ( * edit : i mean from cover to cover ... * ) but i 'd expand your point with asking how does reading any holy book really improve the knowledge of any religion ? 
  how much does any religion as a modern-day institution correspond with the contents of a holy book ? 
   although there 's continuous `` general tension '' due to historical reasons and fear of russian attack plays central role in the identity-formation of finnish people and political imagination/rhetorics as well good that you pointed this out . 
  it 's one of those things that seems almost inconceivable for a lot of people , our dynamic with russia . 
  yes , we 're a neighboring country , yes we 've always had good relations with russia , but no , we were not an u.s.s.r. satellite state unless you define that very loosely and no , we 've never quite been in the russian sphere of influence . 
  not quite . 
  there 's still a lot of historical baggage and racial tensions going on , and this is something that you do n't really see from looking at the maps . 
  just recently stratfor publicized a study stating that karelia would appeal joining back to finland , for instance . 
  what in essence is left out is the racial tensions that a lot of people have towards russia and russians here in finland . 
  i 'd love it if this was n't the case , but they know in russia just as well as we do in here that we are n't slavs , we 're not russian , not quite enough and it only makes sense in the historical context . 
  one would do well to keep in mind that fennougric people were systematically persecuted in stalin 's russia , forced to migrate from their homes within russia and thrown into gulags . 
  so despite having good relations with russia , deploying keen diplomatic skills with them and even benefiting from cooperation , it might be safe to say considering the mutual uneasy history that we do n't really want to march by their tune that much at all , diplomatically speaking . 
  i do n't know about the rest , but karelia rejoining finland is not going to happen , not likely to ever happen at all and absolutely impossible in the next decade . 
  people in karelia these days have deeper cultural ties to st. petersburg than finland , and nobody in their right mind in finland wants the worthless territory of a toxic waste dump of a 3rd world country rejoined . 
  unless , well , russian federation pays us to take it out of their hands . 
  which is n't happening , not now , not ever . 
  well for one i 'm not surprised if estonians have a strong dislike towards a certain specific other nation . 
  just look at their history . 
  should also be noted that this news and statistic it 's based on is about * crimes reported * to the police . 
  as in crime reports filed . 
  the number of crime reports filed where the suspected perpetrator is not originally of finnish descent has gone up by 179 % . 
  there have been legislative changes and changes in the statistics gathering practices : last year sexual harassment became a criminal offence in itself , as a distinct reportable and punishable crime . 
  it is to be expected that by this fact alone there will be more of this kind of crime to be reported .

  enforce all people to have hussar wings on their bicycles . 
  it had lots of bugs when it was new . 
  one of said bugs caused a complete file system corruption . 
  was n't really fun to get your phone bricked randomly . 
  did n't those tax breaks end this year ? 
  well then my point stands : oh shut up . 
  there 's nothing americanized about it , you 're just looking for a reason to be angry at america . 
  okay , i thought you were agreeing that it was `` americanized bullshit that we have national trees birds minerals condiments and diet cokes '' . 
  the russian doctrine is n't that effective that everything is hopeless . 
  i mean , look at ukraine . 
  they 're holding just fine . 
  what are you saying ? 
  are you asking if tier 3 networks ( isps ) have to pay tier 2 networks in order for them to route your data across their network ? 
  yes . 
  that is how it has worked always . 
  tier 3 pays tier 2 money so that they can use their network , and tier 2 pays tier 1 in order to use their network . 
  tier 1 networks have deals with other tier 1 networks so that everyone can route their packets across their networks in the end . 
  yeah , they seem to be taking r\u00f6ntgen pics since the older woman is wearing a lead apron . 
  yeah . 
  completely normal among old women over here , especially closer to the russian border . 
  it makes all these soldiers of odin people who shout `` get that fucking scarf off your head '' to immigrants even more funny . 
  it does n't mean that . 
  it means that 90 % of new products contain ** something animal based ** . 
  that means milk , gelatin ( used in yogurt , candies and so on ) and meat along with other stuff . 
  you 're thinking of vegetarian food . 
  vegan is different . 
  my point is that they never `` went back to making rubber boots '' since they never stopped making the boots . 
  the company that makes the boots has been its own company since 1990 and since 2005 it has been owned by berner ltd. 
  nokian jalkineet is not the same company as nokia the telcom company . 
  they make the best goddamn rubber boots btw . 
  so what ? 
  you live in a house regardless . 
  two weeks done , one week to go . 
  that looks awful . 
  what 's bleak is russia 's track record when it comes to leaders . 
  that 's even more fucked up . 
  the point is that we use more and more natural resources . 
  lower latency is one of the major points of 5g too . 
  crazy ? 
  there 's a very distinct difference between double i and i. 
  i heard they were made by prison inmates ( so not unemployed people like you said ) , and that working with the m\u00f6lkky company is part of their rehabilitation . 
  company that 's not trying to fill its pockets with money must be one retarded company . 
  finland does n't have planned economy , it 's not like you can tell private companies to do business with someone else instead . 
  yeah , fuck us because we happen to be next to russia , am i right ? 
  no we are n't , the food circle/plate is the new shit . 
  you just need to know how much to eat . 
  it 's not rocket science . 
  vegan or vegetarian ? 
  for example , did you ever have kes\u00e4keitto at school ? 
  that 's delicious and does n't have any meat in it . 
  nobody except you is talking about eating `` greens alone '' . 
  uh ... vegetarian food does have fat and sugar . 
  have you heard of berries or fruits ? 
  they tend to be rather sweet ( hint : it 's because of the sugar in them ) . 
  fat intake can be satisfied with some vegetable based oil like olive oil , rape seed oil etc. ... edit : and since this is only about vegetarian food , you can eat cheeses to get the needed fats . 
  or drink some fatty milk straight out of cows udders . 
  what ? 
  surely you 're joking ? 
  yes , it 's a classic love-hate lunch in schools . 
  at least when i was in school . 
  eh ... are you seriously saying that you did n't have any days in school when you had lunch that did n't have a bit of meat ? 
  whoa . 
  humans are omnivorous ?!, 
  never would 've guessed that . 
  i do n't see you complaining due to lingonberry-rye-porridge days in school . 
  rockets ? 
  what ? 
  it 's not like it 's the first time they lost to vikings . 
  that newspaper must be full of idiots . 
  probably has something to do with cheap prices in greece along with poor exchange rate of the russian rouble . 
  in finland we have this term for these kinds of russians that act like idiots : vitun ryss\u00e4 . 
  which netflix ? 
  apparently it was : http://www.iltasanomat.fi/kotimaa/art-2000001204571.html, 
  the state would supply them anyway . 
  so basically : the shooter was ... financially challenged and he won 200 000 euros with some lottery ticket few years back . 
  then he wired 71 thousand euros to his wife 's bank account . 
  in the end the guy went bankrupt and he was foreclosed ( sp ? ), 
  and he had to use his winnings to pay his debts . 
  this also included the 71 thousand on his wifes bank account , which basically disappeared from it . 
  this apparently drove the shooter over the edge . 
  according to national bureau of investigation it was an illegal automatic gun of some sort . 
  edit : it was a stolen rk-62 , the guy had eight full magazines in his house : http://www.iltasanomat.fi/kotimaa/art-2000001204571.html, 
  nice idea , needs more zoomed out panning above the continent though . 
  now you can go to tallinn and buy kuradima palju viina . 
  it 's not any more pagan than may day or our independence day is . 
  it does n't look very polished though . 
  i 'd wager to say that most finns do n't care where you 're from when it comes to receiving support from the state , instead most care if you pay your taxes . 
  that only applies to local city busses , not intercity busses . 
  does it include sitting on someone 's face ? 
  wait . 
  you do n't hail the busses in stockholm ? 
  i 'd rather not die kthx . 
  it 's a pretty new flavour . 
  reminds me of this one time i went to a student party and bought a glass of the most expensive whisky they had , i got a licorice pipe and a smoking jacket with it too . 
  as a programmer : who the fuck designs a maps page where you can not zoom by using your mouse scroll wheel ? 
  i literally meant three rooms ( so usually two bedrooms , lounge/living room + kitchen + bathroom ) , not three bedrooms . 
  i 'm having hard time believing that . 
  there has to be some sort of hard outer shell , like wood or brick . 
  surely your building code ca n't be that lax ? 
  what the fuck .

if you 've ever lived with living assistance ( toimeentulotuki ) , you quickly become familiar how taxing it is for you mentally . 
  you have to apply for it every month and you do n't know if it will be accepted or rejected , thus you end up worrying are you able to pay for your rent , food and other expenses . 
  if you earn too much or have n't spend all the money in your account , or have filled the form wrong , you wo n't get next months payment . 
  so you are not basically allowed to save any money or work small jobs . 
  it 's incredibly stressful and degrading situation to live in . 
  it 's not a system that encourages you to get back into work life . 
  workers and students do n't realize how good they have it . 
  the safety net is very generous for them . 
  honest question : do you consider it acceptable or even preferable to have people this rich in our economy ? 
  if we go back in time to my childhood , figures like this would have been considered to be abominable and a clear sign of failure of the economic system to distribute wealth fairly . 
  i really really do n't get it why reddit admins are so attached to this idea of default subreddits . 
  when you conspire people to socialize in groups based on top to bottom decisions , you 'll always get bad results . 
  it goes completely against the idea of reddit being a forum moderated by its users . 
  if there only were some small country that would lead us by example ... 
  i really like the blatant symbolism in # 8 and the contempt the artist holds for putin . 
  the social stigma is not as bad as it used to be . 
  even my dad came out saying maybe mild drugs should be legalized . 
  and before he considered me a radical for having such opinions . 
  they would also have the biggest influence relative to their their size and get six meps . 
  that would be about sixteen times more meps per citizen than germany . 
  to add to that , the world hegemon has changed before and there 's no reason why it would n't change again . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/world-systems_theory the us has many internal problems from ecological to social disasters happening in slow motion . 
  california is experiencing one of its worst draught ever and it 's only going to get worse , state that every other state is dependant on in food production . 
  much of the south of the state uses water sources that are non-renewable . 
  the growing income gap and every man on its own thinking is leading the march towards social disintegration . 
  most americans are completely delusional of realities of our world , from denying climate change to actively fighting for policies that are non-favourable to themselves . 
  and western europe is following suite , it 's part of the same core countries that are benefiting from worker countries . 
  you have it wrong , not voting is a wasted vote , protest vote is not wasted . 
  because the european left is mostly humanitarian and intellectual movement that is concerned about the well being of people and preventing climate change , when the nationalists want to shut down borders , keep niggers out and rewind the clock before globalization happened . 
  the reason why people are wary of the far-right , is that we do n't want nazi-germany all over again . 
  the left just wants to make europe into 80 's sweden . 
  that 's true . 
  one lead to russian annexation , the second lead to russian puppet regime . 
  i 'm sure the people of crimea were not pressured in any way with tanks at every corner . 
  i had no idea that was n't real . 
  now what are we supposed to bitch about to point out trivial shit eu regulates ? 
  it still heavily favours the two old parties . 
  just comes to show how dissatisfied people are with the current parties . 
  really shame that ld 's attempts at electoral reform have been shot down . 
  the current three party situation wo n't last forever . 
  at least in finland parties do n't decide the list order , instead it 's decided by which candidates get the most votes ( though personally i 'm not convinced that 's a good thing since it encourages celebrity candidates ) also nothing is stopping you from running as independent candidate outside of parties . 
  but it 's probably true that parties are more tighter in mmp , but i do n't see that as a bad thing . 
  after all you are not representing yourself but a group of people and maybe one ideology . 
  with parties voters have more control over what they vote for . 
  even if all mps were independent , the fact remains that they still have to make compromises at some level , that 's what democracy is . 
  parties make those compromises more obvious to voters . 
  here 's proportional representation explained in comparison to fptp ( uk system ) : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt0i-sdosxu, 
  pmq is just a small part of the whole system . 
  you have de facto two-party system and the only reason to defend that is some foolish nationalist pride . 
  multi-party system is just hands down better form of democracy . 
  i do n't think gay marriage is that big political issue here . 
  i 'd imagine most people think it 's going to happen eventually anyway so it 's kind of moot point to put effort into it . 
  i kind of miss bush . 
  at least he was obviously just an evil man of the oil industry that everyone hated . 
  there was no question about it . 
  obama is a lot more well-spoken and sly . 
  he seems rational and understanding and yet his actions are just as bad as bush 's . 
  greece seems to have lots of opinions on german overall ... 
  itt everyone acts like a fucking five year old . 
  nude calendar in itself is not sexist , it is sexual but that does n't make it sexist . 
  nude calendar in cultural context can be sexist . 
  it can feed on sexist attitudes . 
  to determine that you have to look into russian culture and its gender roles . 
  that takes a bit more effort than just blurt a few idiotic lines on reddit . 
  in spoken language you could also say : kuusi kuusi palaa palaa palavana, 
  i 'll just assume you are trolling because i refuse to accept anyone can be that stupid . 
  sucks when that happens . 
  the trash should n't be collected seperately if there is no infrastructure to handel that . 
  lots of people use that as an excuse not to recycle . 
  sadly this is true . 
  seven years ago the finnish right-wing party increased president 's salary by 20 % to 160 000 $ per year and now when their own party member is the ruling president , they lower it back to the level it was , making it seem like a great gesture of self-sacrifice . 
   but i am getting tired of all the `` x is not part of x '' discussions ... 
  yes !, 
  i really do n't mind if you think of finland as scandinavian country or not , but i 'm fed up hearing this same old argument . 
  people are too hang up on words . 
  that lonely and bitter was a stupid strawman , but so is your conception of feminists . 
  you can be feminist and anti-immigration . 
  oh look , it 's the lonely bitter men of reddit blaming feminism of all the world 's issues . 
  never seen that before . 
  why is it the americans and english that are outraged by this ? 
  you do n't even live here . 
  yes it 's a bit silly but they just tried to be considerate in easing their moving to finland . 
  nobody is forced to hide their cleavage . 
  just do n't go starting more wars in middle-east and we are good . 
   i 'm assuming it 's because they feel unsafe on their bicycle that sounds really condescending to me . 
  you do n't wear helmet to feel safe , but to minimize your injuries in case of accident . 
  the real reason people do n't wear helmet is because it looks kind of dorky and is inconvenient to carry around . 
  i 've fallen over once as a kid on icy road , hit my head on the ground and i was really lucky since i usually do n't wear helmet , but that time i did . 
  aww , poor helmboy . 
  so all the negatives of privately funded schools without actually being privately funded ? 
  yeah but let 's be real here , there 's plenty of jobs in finland that are not good enough for highly educated finnish youth . 
  and there 's plenty of jobs already that get shit pay ( shop clerks for example ) . 
  i can see the risk here but with the amount of asylum seekers finland takes in , that 's not something we ca n't handle . 
  no , it 's business . 
  technically he could but without doubt he will present the bill ( the equal marriage bill has already passed , this is about necessary changes to existing laws ) . 
  it was decided by the previous parliament and disrespecting their decision would be a direct attack on agreed practices , causing ps to lose any credibility it has managed to build . 
  to be fair sweden has a long history of having lax attitude towards gay relationships when it was illegal in many other countries . 
  but in general these issues of individual freedom have never been politicized here in the same manner they have been in america for instance . 
  instead our political discussion has always revolved around on questions of economic equality . 
  when drugs are some day decriminalized it 's not going to be as a result of big political debate but something that happens as a result of consensus , more or less .

  if we have money to send to corrupt governments we sure enough have money to spend on science . 
  [ now have you ever shot one of these ? 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-p6dys8q78 ) i do n't suggest that this would be the solution , but you get the point ... it 's not like it is unstoppable . 
  exactly . 
  well that is one hell of a blue eyed way to look at the world . 
  what user are you quoting and why are you quoting him/her/it / to me ? 
  for fuck 's sake ... you said :  to be honest , ** your ** direct implication that if you do n't shoot at rafts people will eventually kick you out of your bed and make you live in cardbox makes this question a bit hard to answer . 
  `` you do n't think we should shoot at immigrants ? 
  you must be one of those people who politely leave when somebody tries to expell them from their home . '', 
  you ca n't ask people to answer rhetorical questions when there 's such an obvious gap between two positions . 
  quoting someone else as if you were replying to me . 
  what is sad is that of all the shit the eu spends money on , they do n't even spend a billion on esa . 
  we could start with not moving the whole damn eu parliament between two cities and put that money into esa instead . 
  debate is good . 
  do n't understand why some people insist on thinking that a debate is bad . 
  or far-left lunatics . 
  it 's important to vote . 
  but this video is shit , with a opportunistic dick who loves the attention and is in it for the money made by ssu the most corrupt political youth organisation in sweden . 
  this h\u00f6ss , one day he wants to forget his past , the other day he is selling nazi stuff online , then he used to be in a neo-nazis organisation etc. 
  and now suddenly he 's a victim again . 
  give me a break . 
   what if someone non-threatening decided to live in your bedroom and they wo n't leave when asked kindly ? 
  who are you quoting ? 
   what , how are personal bedrooms and `` lives-somewhere-in-the-country-or-in-another-country-in-europe '' the same thing ? 
  it 's just not comparable . 
  who are you quoting ? 
   anyway , what should the police do then if they do n't listen to kind words ? 
  just go away ? 
  nice job ignoring my question . 
  who are you quoting ? 
  no it was n't they tried to make the point that if you do n't vote all hell will break loose . 
  in fact voting is no guarantee for any particular outcome . 
   but overall comparisons with 1930s germany are completely over the top . 
  precisely . 
  i mean this is just a little too much . 
  also , it 's from sweden where everything is considered racist or right wing , so instead of motivating at least me it just pisses me off . 
  and it is ssu who are notoriously moronic and corrupt . 
  they falsified documents and got almost 500 000 sek wrongfully paid to them by the swedish tax payer and they also wrongfully claimed 1.2 million sek at another incident . 
  so having them pretending to be on some moral high horse makes me sick . 
  never forget to vote . 
  well hate to break it too you , the nazis got elected into power . 
  scaremongering is what this is , nothing else . 
  coming from sweden it makes it even more disgusting as sweden is completely up the walls crazy when it comes to right-wing-scare . 
  i mean if you eat a cookie that is the wrong colour you 'll be called a right-wing extremist . 
  the guy in the video is also a damn opportunistic worm : http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,l-4070115,00.html, 
  hah ... you really showed the ruskies this time . 
  who are you quoting ? 
   and once more you fail to see my point and try to twist it against me . 
  well either you can not write or you do n't know what your saying yourself . 
   how about we put in a comprehensive system that allows immigrants to find work and a home , same as any national . 
  sweden does that well , even if people claim ** it discriminates against swedish nationals ** . 
  tell me what that does mean if it does n't mean that you take jobs from others to give to immigrants . 
  furthermore i said , `` so if i understand you correctly . '', 
  that means that i asked you if i understood you correctly . 
  i mean just this part of your post shows that you 're completely lost and arguing with you is pointless . 
   oh , have you ? 
  why did n't you tell me this earlier ? 
  because you did n't ask . 
   name me the countries you lived in , then . 
  if you believe yourself superior to me in this way , put it on the table . 
  i never said i was superior i said i `` most likely have lived in countries than you '' . 
  most likely means that i am unsure . 
  you seem to lack skills in reading comprehension . 
  where i 've lived . 
  well if you need to know i suggest you go through some of my post in other threads , it is n't a secret . 
  i can give you a hint , it 's four countries . 
  what i 've done in these countries is to work and live and the rest of that is non of your damn business . 
  a conflict zone you say . 
  we can start with kosovo . 
  now you tell me where you 've been . 
  cos i 've got a few more on my list of conflicts where i 've seeing human suffering and learning that we can do more good there than here . 
  i guess i should not keep my hopes up as your most likely a pacifist computer warrior saving the world with no hand on experience from the ugly reality of our world . 
  edit : in fact do n't bother to answer , i do n't care . 
  there is no such thing as fairness in the broader perspective of the world . 
  we have limited resources and we 're simply too many to make it work . 
  the biggest source of terrorism in the world is the religion of islam and a religious conviction you can not take away from a person . 
  criminals will be criminals no matter where they are . 
  economically impossible to make the world equal . 
  for every million people removed from poverty a year a further five million is born into poverty a year . 
  human rights does not mean that we need to put our selves into poverty . 
  i ca n't vote in turkey so do n't worry . 
   how about we put in a comprehensive system that allows immigrants to find work and a home , same as any national . 
  sweden does that well , even if people claim it discriminates against swedish nationals . 
  helping them integrate is better than throwing them to the wolves , like you 'd advocate . 
  so if i understand you correctly . 
  it is better to ensure that the immigrants have jobs than the domestic people ? 
  this would mean that we make other loose their livelihood to the benefit of someone else from another country ? 
  how will you find work and a home to everyone coming into the eu illegally and how do you suggest we pay for this ? 
   aswell as the norwegians do , they must work to gain social welfare . 
  what work do you suggest we give them . 
  we got just hit by the news that 4 million in spain are without a job . 
  should we not try to find them jobs within the eu before giving it to others ? 
   you advocate shooting refugee rafts well if you shoot at them they 'll stop . 
  if they stop they 'll survive . 
  if they drive into the shots fired they decided to ... well kill themselves . 
  if someone shoots a warning shot , would you keep on heading towards the same direction or turn around ? 
   they go there , open up a cafe or so , but only to find the cultures there do n't have the same . 
  they end up stuck in a purgatory . 
  well then they can go back ca n't they . 
  just take ones two legs and start putting one in front of the other .

  remember that most of the states on top are eastern european states , which means that they start at a very low level and enjoyed benefits from significant wealth transfer mechanisms within eu during this period . 
  gps growth is measured as percentage of one in 2004 , meaning if you start low , you get bigger numbers . 
  pretty much the highest you can go as a developed country in this time period is sweden , and their main competitive advantage appears to be in having their own national currency that could depreciate when it was needed . 
  that 's a pretty damning statement for eurozone and effect of euro on economy . 
  sweden makes for a good control group as a developed state that is outside euro . 
  as compared to islamist conquest and related genocide in europe ? 
  not even close . 
  we 'd have to push systemic slavery , butchery , child theft and torture of unbelievers for several centuries just to get on your level . 
  chances are they have . 
  there are simply too many agreeing with these views . 
  i was . 
  as far as i know , we did n't lose any meaningful means of economic activities to turkey . 
  you 're massively projecting your own losses on everyone else and yet appearing to think that others are projecting because you imagine them having the same crime levels , and now apparently same economic problems as you . 
  still nowhere close to meeing the goal you yourself set :  / wiki/crime _ in_countrynamehere and voila . 
  now everyone is the capital of organized crime in europe . 
  i believe this concludes this thought exercise , proving the exact opposite of what you wanted it to show . 
  that kosovo is indeed a capital of organised crime in europe , unlike all those other states . 
  no , but they are certainly deterred . 
  and crime control is never about total elimination , unless you 're stalin . 
  it 's about deterrence . 
  indeed . 
  it was a very softened version of original texts . 
  those usually demand death penalty after torture to appease the foreign leader and retain honour . 
  no , i forgot that many people in this reddit are completely disconnected from reality and have absolutely no grasp on recent history : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/red_army_faction and if you look at total numbers , it 's essentially islamists and marxists today . 
  with marxists being mostly across asia and south america , and islamists everywhere else . 
  another person posted a total count of right wing attacks during last 55 years . 
  it numbers four . 
  ultra left wing attacks are orders of magnitude more common , and islamist attacks are several times more common than ultra leftist . 
  did you notice that germany still had the law against insulting foreign leaders on the books until very recently ? 
  back then , we were still a part of russia . 
  lenin signed our independence at the very end of ww1 . 
  ottoman empire has already been beheaded . 
  and greece is cleaning off the blood ? 
  content . 
  and leaders back then * always * remembered who insulted them . 
  that 's how ruling back then worked . 
  you did n't forget insults to honour , which was one of the primary motivators for ruling class ' actions . 
  very well . 
  apparently you are wilfully ignorant of the problems with the commission rather than aware , and just willing to white wash them . 
  on your last point , if you bothered reading the points presented in the immediate reply , you would get what you 're looking for . 
  but as you have demonstrated significant tendency to just ignore the answer when it does n't fit your narrative , i wo n't hold my breath for you to acknowledge it this time around . 
  that can be answered in one word . 
  `` content '' . 
  and now , a reality check . 
  you listed right wing terrorism from 55 years past . 
  ** you got four cases total . 
  ** as a point of comparison , ultra left marxist terrorism is so common , it 's several orders of magnitude more common than right wing terrorism . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/left-wing_terrorism and islamic terrorism is even greater than that . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/islamic_terrorism there 's a reason why i stated that currently terrorism is essentially of two kinds . 
  and you list the exact reason why . 
  there 's almost no right wing terrorism that is n't following islamic ideology . 
  if you made a chart , it would n't be really visible . 
  most of the chart would be taken by islamic terror , with remaining being mostly marxists and leninists . 
  i once again refer you to jury of our peers , who have clearly understood the message . 
  you can be that special snowflake that just does n't get it . 
  it does n't make the statement `` meaningless '' . 
  it just means that you can not comprehend it for some reason that is not attributed to statement itself . 
  it 's quite simple . 
  i look at reality . 
  you apparently seem to state here that you do not . 
  if you disagree , feel free to point out what it is you disagree with and i can provide relevant citations . 
  not that it matters to someone ideologically invested in ignoring objective reality . 
  but our audience might care . 
  pretty standard `` for the rich and globalisation , against the poor and middle class '' platform . 
  all the standard talking points like `` remove inheritance tax '' , `` liberalise job market '' and so on are in . 
  more of the same slow sinking toward misery , as lower middle class start falling into lower class faster and society continues to come apart at the seams as income disparity increases . 
  do you know what happened in 1400s when you did a carnival like that about state leaders ? 
  they call it `` rack '' . 
  google it . 
  the sheer levels of cognitive dissonance in your mind must be crippling to produce this kind of absurdity instead of simply taking the sentence at face value which is exceedingly clear . 
   i honestly still do n't know what the fuck you were trying to say . 
  to paraphrase the famous saying : `` when someone 's belief system hinges on not understanding reality , it 's very hard to make them understand reality '' . 
  so basically you admit to the problem with the commission , you just desperately paint it as something good . 
  notably most of the people on your ideological side are actually with me on the issues of commission 's power and patently undemocratic selection system . 
  those that are n't quite as authoritarian as you are that is . 
  that you choose to just not address most of the points demonstrates yet again that you simply have no way of arguing the points without making yourself look as what you actually are . 
  you know how the whole `` ministry of truth '' and `` we must oppose ideological wrong think '' with government funding because `` fake news '' ? 
  this is a post on / r/europe that has over 8k upvotes in less than a day , where most upvoted comment is nothing but de-humanization of a person based on his world view . 
  we get what our tax money pays for i guess . 
  if anyone needs a reason to truly fear the rising of the authoritarian far left , this post is a great example of the reasons why . 
  there is absolutely * nothing * unclear about that statement . 
  it 's crystal clear to anyone that can comprehend even passable english . 
  if it is unclear to you , do n't look at the language . 
  look at your own ideological world view . 
  that is likely the main factor blocking you from comprehending this very simple statement . 
  do you also offer assault rifles as a replacement when someone asks for a truck to haul goods ? 
  by `` hull '' mean the actual `` hull '' of the ship , with all necessary hardware inside it but power plant and some mission critical hardware . 
  backup diesels are obviously a part of such a package . 
  mea culpa for not being clear enough . 
  lots of artillery with armour to protect it will stall any assault for a significant amount of time and make advancement bloody . 
  that 's what we saw in ukraine on both sides . 
  every time one side managed to get significant amount of force projected onto specific region and start punching through , concentrated artillery barrage stopped the front line from collapsing . 
  do n't let the whole `` but attacking a shitty third world hell hole with accurate weapons '' fool you . 
  if you 're waging a war of conquest , the biggest factor is still artillery , for both sides . 
   you came up with the implication that the eu attacked the national identity of its member states , and i have seen no citations to the contrary . 
  more specifically you have seen them . 
  you just did n't acknowledge them . 
  this is common for people who maliciously argue in bad faith as you do . 
  the ep is directly elected . 
  the council is your own government .

  it is not even that good . 
  i guess it was good with pasta when i was like 6 . 
  i wonder if they should keep some of the places running for homeless/poor people ( not that there are many in norway , but there probably are some , just like in finland ) . 
  note to self : never travel to bulgaria or romania . 
  they are apparently warzones . 
  they run away from iraqis , somalis , afghans and syrians , guess who they find in sweden , 
  i wonder how well it would correlate with ` survey : germans want to get rid of muslims ' . 
  yeah , it is pretty ridiculous . 
  it might not be `` fair '' , but we should give him option of either accepting verdict without possibilty of appeal or deport him . 
  * abrahamic religions ( just a small nitpick  ), 
  there have been multiple news about russian media misrepresenting child custody cases where one parent in finnish and another is russian where the russian parent has lost custody because `` she is russian '' ( that might be bad way to put it , but i do n't want to spend 30min to reply to you . ), 
  here is example , unfortunately in finnish : http://www.mtv.fi/uutiset/ulkomaat/artikkeli/venajan-media-kohisee-taas-huostaanotosta-suomessa-myos-venajan-lapsiasianvaltuutettu-kommentoi/5644772 then there is this guy : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/johan_b%c3%a4ckman who russian media love to quote and to interview as `` finnish expert/professor/whatever '' . 
  he is a finn who has been preaching pro-russian , anti-finnish , anti-baltic lies/twisted truths for last 10 years . 
  i do , after crimea , ukraine and constant anti-eu ( and anti-finnish ) propaganda by russian news agencies i do n't think anyone can really claim russia is n't a threat . 
  this one was suspected to be done by somali gang though . 
  seems we are lucky in finland , our somalis commit only 17x more rapes and iraqis just 10x than native finns ( 1x ) . 
  we can in take some native swedes immigrants though , they are the only nationality with less than 1x multiplier . 
  that 's a good idea , so there is 0 % it is going to happen . 
  it does n't really help , at least not right away . 
  perhaps it does make some small difference for next generations . 
  i would n't be surprised if there will be a lot more of these small laws against hardline islam . 
  it is more about sending a message `` we do n't really want muslims here '' . 
  even if something is illegal and punishable does n't mean it is punished . 
  i 'd imagine in houses following strict islamic law the women ca n't really speak out to authorities , either because they have been taught not to or because they fear for their lives if they do . 
  all scots i have met have been nice . 
  overall i 've had best experience with people from historically protestant countries . 
  perhaps this is partly because people from these countries tend to speak good english which makes communication easier . 
  but what marxist need money for ? 
  perhaps atlantis has been in plain sight all this time !, 
   finno-ugric finnish , estonian , hungarian , sami , people living north-east of finland . 
  it might be so , i vaguely remember reading about that too . 
  might have been his grandparents though . 
  i think it is fairly simple , really : when in rome , do as the romans do . 
  yeah , it is easy to be neutral when other countries take care of your defense , like finland acting as buffer between sweden and russia . 
  and build a wall !, 
  it is aspiring to be part of eu and is part of europe . 
  well , i guess austria was more like full cake . 
  well , quite large part of eu is in `` russia 's sphere of influence '' : finland , baltics , ukraine , belarus , poland , romania ... basically all areas that at some point of time were part russian empire ' or soviet union . 
  russia needs external enemy , waging these small wars and taking land is good way to keep up national unity . 
  historically ? 
  ww2 might not have happened in such a large scale . 
  today ? 
  we should send troops to ukraine . 
  it would increase tension , but also give clear message that we stand united and to attack one is to attack all . 
  putin is doing good of following hitler 's footsteps . 
  one small slice at the time , and western europe wo n't really care until it is too late . 
  that 's on your local distributor . 
  they have an option to have same release date ( give or take few days ) on almost all movies , they just choose not to since it costs them more . 
  unfortunately they lack english subs . 
  the moment they add them , i 'll subscribe . 
  but those are not true jihadists !, 
  yeah , but then people would cry for equal rights , constitution , blah blah blah ... 
  you can call them hypocrite though . 
  i actually do n't think most people on this subreddit has anything against syrians , it is mainly the people who try to pose as syrians or who come mainly for better quality of life , for example somalis and afghans . 
  obviously somalia or afghanistan is not finland-level safe , but if we start accepting people from those countries , then it is very hard to deny people from any african country . 
  i ca n't really criticize those ` quality-of-life-refugees ' since i would do the same in their position , but i still do n't want them here . 
  it affects my life negatively . 
  as for iraqis , it is much tougher situation , since there is actually fighting going on at some parts of the country . 
  i 'm not necessarily talking about legal/ethical point of view , but rather from utilitarian point of view that these are often the kind of immigrants we actually want : secular and educated . 
  pretty sure a lot of people are not returning . 
  they would actually be people we should take as refugees . 
  bit surprised ships can just `` disappear '' . 
  problem is prison is really expensive . 
  each prisoner costs 50k-75k per year , so you need 3-5 people 's taxes just to pay for him . 
  it might not be ethical to send them back , but it is economical . 
  yes , we should help and welcome the 1 % ( or probably like 20 % , that seem to be good estimate of the % of refugees who will integrate quickly and get employed ) . 
  easiest way of course would be american way of handpicking `` good '' refugees from the camps , unfortunately for us european we also get also get the worst of the worst . 
  i 'd imagine best way to force integration is to tie all monetary benefits to integration , if you ca n't speak the language at level x after y months , you get nothing until you reach rank x. 
  so yes , you can stay here if you want , but you will stay in some mass apartment in middle of nowhere . 
  they can just not pay after everything is rebuilt though . 
  downgrade :(, 
  usa has worked fine because immigrants either have to a ) be rich b ) work c ) starve . 
  usa has worked fine because immigrants either have to a ) be rich b ) work c ) starve . 
  it worked well in america because people either had to work or starve . 
  not surprising since so many countries stopped letting people through . 
  coming all the way to north is much harder now . 
  nonetheless , it is worth remembering that even though there are less asylum seekers coming , it still means people are coming and the number of asylum seekers in norway is increasing . 
  having winston churchill take part in a cavalry charge is much cooler , though . 
  then again , had germany won and russia lost the ww2 , your opinion would very likely be different . 
  true , but cogs of bureaucracy move slowly and the issue was n't very important until 2015 . 
  can you even go to us with erasmus ? 
  anyways , if you do n't want big change in your life , northern europe is good choice , either finland or sweden . 
  ( at least as a finn i feel we get best along with estonians , brits and swedes ) . 
  if you 'd prefer bit more drastic change in lifestyle , go southern europe . 
  why would german and french be alienated from each other ? 
  i 'd say the exact opposite happens , the `` native '' europeans would became closer . 
  `` age of around 16-17 '' -  age around 30, 
  the real problem is the inter-company loans . 
  i just ca n't see any real way of preventing them , so changing the tax laws is probably the best fix . 
  then again , we should have just kept the maps from 1900 since they will soon be accurate once more . 
  i guess we should demand some compensation from russia for having to redraw our maps . 
  i swear it was n't there before !, 
  ( well , maybe i do n't swear that . ), 
  bit surprised stockholm did n't make it to the list . 
  the region was probably and the city was definitely greek pre-1400s . 
  but how do you get personal union if you ca n't go to war ? 
  chinese median wage is likely lower though . 
  this obviously has nothing to do with islam . 
  can you trade us some of your somalis ? 
  our working rate is only 10 % : /,

  it costs a lot to build gas pipelines . 
  so if there 's only a little gas there 's no point in trying to recover it . 
  but the flame does n't produce that much light , it 's the regular electric lighting that shows on this map . 
  in old english there was no standard spelling in the first place , though . 
  and use a tortilla for the base . 
  the hungarians actually up and moved their whole country elsewhere . 
  multiple times even . 
  better yet , `` finland belonged to the soviet union '' . 
  gratis to the consumer , smartass . 
  if you 'd slightly edit it into `` imisei eess\u00e4 '' it could be estonian/karelian . 
  `` ihmisten edess\u00e4 '' in standard finnish , `` in front of people '' . 
  yes , but do you need to know about the visegrad group or the baltic assembly ? 
  they have a very high gdp , so % of gdp can be misleading . 
  the inner page has the word `` passport '' in eu languages , at least in the finnish passport . 
  they 'll just show his face and the enemy just quickly nopes out . 
  except who else is best in eating golf balls or the best in the family to avoid work ? 
  pick what youre good at !, 
  part of the problem is that the superpowers agreed there 'd be no nuclear weapons in small states . 
  that 's a political decision too . 
  also , it 's not like we get to choose . 
  americans can elect whoever they want , you have to deal with the consequences whether you wanted or not . 
  i agree that op is pulling numbers out of his ass . 
  but rtfop . 
   how would you design a low cost european army for 500b ? 
  it 's a question post , not a statement post . 
  fortunately you have a phd in military science and can reply to correct the misconceptions . 
  right ? 
  i am fully qualified , i 've read tom clancy !, 
  they need you at / r/shittyaskscience or / r/explainlikeimcalvin . 
  yes , but the damage from brexit and whatever hullabaloo trump will stir up with nato has n't been done yet for the most part , because neither has happened - yet . 
  so much of the reason for brexit was racism against immigrant slavs that it makes you doubt if an even more radical nationalist future government in britain would send their men to die into what they 'd consider a border skirmish between slavic countries . 
  likely ? 
  not really . 
  but security policy planning should n't be based just on the best-case scenario - you do n't buy insurance for not crashing your car . 
  what i mean is that because uk and eu interests do n't align anymore , the uk can be played against the eu . 
  uk and russia do n't have to be best friends for this to work . 
  a kind of a similar situation has happened before : the [ franco-british plan for intervention in the winter war ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/franco-british_plans_for_intervention_in_the_winter_war ) . 
  the uk was against the invasion of finland by the soviet union , but assistance plans came to nothing and finland had to deal with the soviets themselves . 
  this is a good example how the lack of european unity and complacency with respect to defence preparation led to disasterous consequences : the nazi-soviet alliance could raze half of europe to the ground . 
  also , brexit was if not organized by putin 's neoimperialist russia , at least very much in their interest . 
  they 've been supporting various nationalist and even neo-nazi organizations in the west . 
  first , there really needs to be a proper independent european nuclear force with theater and tactical ballistic nuclear missiles . 
  the u.s. does n't necessarily have any interest in defending europe anymore , so its nuclear weapons may be withdrawn or not used when needed - you ca n't rely on them if the u.s. and russia are allied . 
  the u.k. is also in russia 's pocket . 
  france is the only eu country armed with nuclear weapons , and it 's questionable if france would risk nuclear war just because some border country got invaded . 
  europe is really going to a gunfight with a knife . 
  as for where , russia 's main nuclear base is in murmansk : 2/3 of the strength of the russian navy is concentrated there . 
  it shows that according to russia , northern lapland ( in norway , sweden and finland ) would be likely the first flash point in a crisis : russia would occupy the area in order to prevent attacks on murmansk and allow them freedom to operate in the north atlantic . 
  thus , they could set up a naval blockade against transports from north america to europe . 
  military strength in this area is completely mismatched : russia has unmatched numerical superiority ( see [ this ] ( http://docplayer.fi/docs-images/40/4376360/images/page_4.jpg ) ) . 
  western thinking about this is extremely complacent ; there has been no political commitment and nobody is talking about this . 
  sweden has downsized its military so that they can theoretically only defend stockholm for a week , trump is going to undermine norway 's nato protection and finland has some strength but still too low spending per gdp , and their refusal to ally with nato reduces the credibility of their defense . 
  they 'd be easy targets for nuclear blackmail - or even conventional forces blackmail . 
  as for what kind forces are needed , russia has excellent tactical ballistic missiles ( iskander ) , submarines , chemical weapons , tactical and strategic nuclear weapons and attack helicopters . 
  the neighboring countries totally lack these , in addition to sufficient investment in air forces and other conventional weaponry . 
  it 's in principle correct but in actual medical practice you need a continuous blood alcohol level of 0.15 % , which is hard to sustain just by drinking - they use an iv drip . 
  methanol and ethanol are metabolized by the same enzymes , so that ethanol competes with methanol . 
  thus , methanol toxicity is reduced and it can be eliminated in urine instead . 
  but , synthetic blockers are better than ethanol . 
  that 's the point . 
  this juxtaposed against other immigration news makes it seem like satire . 
  i had to check if this is / r/nottheonion . 
  european countries ca n't deport multiple murderers but then swiss then do this . 
  one of the reasons articles are n't read much is the esotericism the closed publication model causes . 
  experts in orthotopology tend to publish only in journal of orthotopology , which is published by the society of orthotopology and open only to subscribers and members . 
  meanwhile a researcher in the related field of hypermystics finds the abstract but ca n't access the article , and the orthotopology country club stays exclusive . 
  this issue is subject to a network effect . 
  which is a function of how many articles you publish . 
  the h-index can never be higher than your publication count . 
  this is how professors can get 10 + points more to their h-index : they coauthor everything . 
  those things reduce gdp and cause contraction ( negative growth ) . 
  the best news here is the fall in unemployment from 27 to 23 % . 
  a 27 % unemployment is downright dangerous , wartime level . 
  any idea where the new growth came from ? 
  tourism ? 
  facebook replaces actual social interactions and makes people less happy , according to scientific studies . 
  people then pay for it through the price of the advertised product . 
  as for why people use , peer pressure is a bitch . 
  i 've been pressured to use facebook and whatsapp by many people and although i have n't yielded to the pressure , the majority of people would . 
  high share price does n't mean anything by itself , if those resources are taken from more productive activities . 
  cancerous tumors also have a lot of cells and spend a lot of energy , but the organism would be better off without them . 
  facebook is n't actually that good with advertising . 
  their trick is to monopolize a market . 
  monopols are of course profitable to their owners but the overall product would be higher in a more competitive market . 
  i do n't know why you 're conflating google with facebook because google makes services and products that are actually beneficial to their users . 
  using facebook is a net loss for the user . 
  this is why in north sweden the employment rate is high , salaries are near average and generally things are good . 
  there 's no reason for the idle to stay there . 
  in finland , there 's unemployment and many young people who have never had a job . 
  facebook does n't create wealth , much less prosperity or happiness . 
  it 's after all just a shitty ad service . 
  believing facebook to be good for the economy is subscribing to the fallacy of the broken window . 
  the world would be better without it . 
  the eu does n't have unchecked powers to `` kill corporations '' or `` ban cars '' . 
  only national governments have this sort of power and to get the eu to act the decision should be unanimous . 
  enforcement power is retained by member states . 
  it 's interesting to see how large the difference is between the countries . 
  finland is almost completely inhabited , only some national park areas in the north have no population at all . 
  more than half of sweden is largely uninhabited . 
  iirc 60 % of people living north of the 60 \u00b0 parallel are finns .

i think his issues with europe 's relations with russia is that they 're too polarized ; before events of ukraine europeans were too confident with the friendly relationship and afterwards europeans have turned very hostile towards russia . 
  the finnish stance has always been about strong defense and friendly relationships . 
  you 'll need to be careful and prepared against hostile actions from russia , but that shoudnt stop you from having friendly relations with them . 
  strong defense alone will be enough to stop any hostile actions , but good relations will help russians realize they need europe too and the risk of destroying them will cause them to think twice before doing hostile actions . 
  i think they 're just staring at the numbers without thinking the reality behind them . 
  we do use russian gas , but instead of delivering that straight to ordinary homes we burn it and turn it into electricity or heat . 
  so even if russia closes the pipe we can use our wartime reserves and afterwards burn f.ex . 
  coal or trees to keep houses warm . 
  other european countries dont have that luxury , they 'll need to get gas or people will freeze in their apartments . 
   `` i ca n't for the life of me understand why you would want to punish people who create something out of nothing , '' he said . 
  he doesnt create anything out of nothing . 
  his and his employees education is paid by tax money , tax money pays for the infrastructure they use , it provides them safety and stability by having an army and hiring police officers and tax money even gives him a reliable safety net in case his business isnt successful . 
  i just dont understand the attitude of taking advantage of opportunities created by public funds and giving a middle finger when expected to pay for them in return . 
  small trivia : [ 58 % of finns consider his party arrogant ] ( http://yle.fi/uutiset/poll_ncp_seen_as_arrogant_by_58_percent_of_finns/7573690 ) accoring to a recent poll . 
  leaves fell off long time ago here . 
  now there 's nothing colorful left , its constantly raining and the days just keep getting shorter . 
  hopefully we 'll get snow early , i hate this cold period of darkness before the proper winter starts . 
  middle-aged alcoholics stab their drinking buddies with knives . 
  as long as you dont take part in those groups finland is as safe as any other european country . 
  the way they split finland is really weird . 
  not sure what 's up with that, 
  they 're all speaking finnish . 
  it just sounds off because he 's constantly placing stess in middle of a sentence while finnish has a fixed stress at the start of sentence . 
  yeah , this seems more like pre-election talk rather than serious suggestion . 
  or as we finns say it , `` kepu pett\u00e4\u00e4 aina '' . 
  of course not . 
  thats the secret behind our numbers ; the goverment doesnt allow you to become unemployed and foces you to get more education or some shitty non-paying trainee job . 
  the ones that refuse dont get unemployment benefits and are counted as `` does not seek a job '' which doesnt count as unemployed . 
  puhemies ( talk-man or speaker-man ) . 
  the gender-neutral puheenjohtaja ( leader of the talk ) is nowdays used outside of parlament but its written as puhemies in law so they 'll have to use it . 
   the speaker chairman would be the correct english word for it . 
  nothing interesting will happen unless the parties want to have new elections right now , but the mp 's wont be having any vacations from now on . 
  they accepted the reactor last time it was proposed and lost huge chunk of votes thanks to it . 
  so now they 'll use the change of manufacturer as an reason why they 'll leave the government despite accepting it last time . 
  e : accepted as in they voted against it but didnt leave the gov ' t when the proposal was passed . 
  i guess he ment finnish defence ministry and wanted to mark the added word with brackets like press does . 
  http://i.imgur.com/1wlep7d.gif similar clip where he suddendly realizes he 's on tv . 
  governments took their lands and tried to eliminate their culture , attempting to make them into regular swedes , norwegians or finns instead of sami people . 
  it was worst in norway and sweden but finland had it 's share of it too . 
  they were afraid that phone market would become like pc market : apple would make great money selling overpriced hardware to enthusiasts and everyone else would have to sell their stuff for cheap since there 's no difference between different brands of android phones . 
  russia says that they are not involved in conflict and the rebels say that ukrane has not had negotiations with them . 
  it might still end with a truce , kremlin seems to be spinning it as `` russia agreed to arrange negotiation between the two parties of the conflict '' . 
  mopo was a brand name for helkama mopeds iirc and the original finnish name for them was mopedi . 
  elmu-kelmu is common one too , comes from elintarvikemuovikelmu . 
  its changing , but majority of finns still oppose it . 
  last poll had 58 % against and 26 % for nato membership . 
   the funny part is that local politicians talk about `` possible natural disasters '' etc. 
  thats the strategy our pro-nato politicans are using . 
  they know the public opinion is against nato , so they 'll promise stuff to nato and back home they 'll state they havent signed anything . 
  if they have its only `` techical document '' and finland hasnt `` moved any closer '' to nato membership in reality its similar to yya treaty and the closest thing to membership that there is . 
  dead/dry skin changes color to gray-ish white for black people . 
  if finland would join nato then russia would get 1300 kilometres of new border with nato and baltic sea would become nato-sea . 
  russia wont just sit idly and watch it happen , they 'll figure out a way to punish us for joining them . 
  there 's also a landslide of other issues with nato ( defence becomes reliant on us , having increase defence spendings to match their criterias , costs for switching to ammunition and systems which nato uses etc. ), 
  but they 're not as important . 
  i 'm guessing its because russian companies coudnt make enough lactose-free stuff to meet the demand . 
  russians bought half of arctech few months ago and are now buying their ships from there so they 'll get money back and work for the shipyard . 
  they 're popular as taxi or private cars too . 
  no whonder , its quite big inside and has good engine but its still reasonably priced . 
  in finland [ transporters ] ( http://i.imgur.com/4cmzp0u.jpg ) are far more common than other police cars , and even if you disallow vans i 'd say [ skoda superb 's ] ( http://i.imgur.com/bffeyvx.jpg ) are still more common than mercedes cars . 
  still a nice to see all of the different patterns and colors each contry has ( orange or green police cars , wtf ? 
  eventually , yes . 
  just like in winter war we 'll eventually run out of resources and have to surrender . 
  but it wont be cheap for russians . 
  they 'll have to do it with mostly their spetsnaz troops and other professionals . 
  the difficult terrain and defender 's advatange alone makes attacking really costly , not to mention stuff like guerrilla war from forests , russia losing their easiest border neighbour and destabilizing their relationship with rest of the world . 
  and both sides have improved from ww2 . 
  back in 20-30 's finns thought that war was really unlikely and the poor nation decided to not spend their monies on weapons . 
  now we 'll have modern stuff like latest aa-missile systems , one of europes largest artillery and tank reserves etc. 
  and dont have to resort to using molotov 's and planks like in last war . 
  this isnt the only article they 've done about it . 
  on the english site they have articles like [ next elections will be a vote on nato ] ( http://yle.fi/uutiset/think_tank_chief_spring_election_could_be_a_nato_vote/7402754 ) and [ finns should be concerned about russia ] ( http://yle.fi/uutiset/analyst_finns_right_to_be_concerned_about_russia/7402606 ) . 
  and this isnt helsingin sanomat who has declared themselves as officially nato-supporting , its supposed to be a politically neutrals . 
  east european countries lost their war against soviet union , and because of that they dont trust their own military anymore and think us is only thing that 'll gurantee their independence . 
  finland succesfully defended , so we trust our boys can still challenge russians in a war . 
  by combining that with good relations we 'll show to russians that peace is much better for both countries , allowing us to stay neutral and act as a bridge between the two sides . 
  by joining nato we would destroy our good relations and escalate the tensions between two sides . 
  and if the next world war starts we 'd just be the front line cannon fodder for nato . 
  its still 26 % for and 56 % against , and i 'm guessing the numbers will return near their original values once the ukraine crisis is over . 
  i 'm a bit suprised how hard yle is promoting the poll considering they 're state-owned . 
  the problem with finnair is that they arent doing well in the first place and a massive setback like that could easily be the last nail in their coffin . 
  the routes to asia are a cornerstone in their new strategy and 40 % of their revenue is generated by those routes . 
  [ the flight time increase ] ( http://i.imgur.com/r2xfof1.png ) ( note the curvature of earth and no-fly zone in ukraine ) and the increase to fuel consumption would be pretty huge . 
  whats even worse is that finnair 's advatange over other companies was their shortest flight time between europe and asia and having to route through central europe would make them the worst choise for passangers . 
  so while they would not go bankrupt in a month , a year-long sanction would be devastating for them and its really hard to figure how they would surrive it . 
  its basically the same explanation as why some people are against nato ; they 'd think it would be better for finland to be a neutral actor between east and west rather than picking a side and getting ready to be the front line for ( physical or trade ) war between the two sides . 
  the current sanctions will hit finland quite hard . 
  valio alone was exporting 350 million euros worth of milk products to russia every year and now cant export any of them . 
  and this is just the first list of sanctions ; the speculated flight ban could bankrupt finnair in months and any further export bans would be devastating for the fragile economy . 
  forest fires are not uncommon during summer but usually they 're much smaller than the one in sweden right now . 
  i dont belive russia would invade now , if they wanted to then they would have done it at the start of the crisis . 
  it would be really strange that they 'd wait for the rebel forces to lose the fight before getting involved themselves . 
  i belive this is just another case where they 'll point at the things other countries are doing and try to direct media away from the weapon shipments and other support for rebels . 
  they 've done it multiple times during this crisis alone , by f.ex . 
  questioning the legity of ukranian goverment , pointing at the `` mercenaries '' ( volunteers ) coming from other countries to ukrane and blaming us and eu for not doing anything about the `` civil war '' in ukraine . 
  they did the same thing for many contry-specific subreddits few weeks back and didnt bother to announce anything back then either, 
  i 've heard from somewhere that their army is impressive in numbers but it hasnt been modernized and thus it woudnt be that effective against modern army . 
  but then i 'm not an military expert , especially not for foreign armies, 
  i dont think putin is stupid enough to attack any european contry . 
  ukraine seems to be the easiest target with no nato membership , large ex-soviet russian minority and somewhat weak army and still russia doesnt want to commit in full-scale war .

  in fact greece did successfully enter the market in 2014 . 
  [ greek bond sale hailed a success after raising $ 3bn ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/apr/10/greece-raises-3bn-euro-successful-bond-sale ) * bond sale , which was oversubscribed by six times , shows the heavily indebted country has regained the trust of the financial markets * but that was before the syriza and v-man with the game theory ... 
  o.o my god , you 're actually taking joke propositions seriously . 
  look , seriously , we wo n't change the calendar . 
  nor will we invent a time machine . 
  and the obvious lack of any serious step-by-step proposals from you tells volumes that you do n't know how to do what you 're suggesting either . 
  no amount of political will will not bend space-time here . 
   it does n't even have to be accepted in the national parliaments before going into effect . 
  it actually has to . 
  as in the real world of adults . 
   i think that there could be a deal very quickly - if there 's a political will to do it time can be slowed down and rules can be bent . 
  please do explain that step by step . 
  because i do n't think political will can actually bend the space-time . 
  the last moment for a quick deal was the last weekend . 
  then it was still possible to have an * additional * extension for the second bailout . 
  if there would have been an agreement by sunday/monday then there would still have been time for the national governments and parliaments to accept it before the program expired on tuesday . 
  now that program has expired . 
  the only way to make a quick deal with that is to invent a time machine , go back in to the past , and to tell the greeks not to walk out from the negotiation and not to call a referendum after the expiration date . 
  or , we could change the calendar . 
  we could change june to include 37 days and july only 24 . 
  then the end of the june would be later and we would still have some time until the end of june . 
  hell , we could change the whole july a june while at it . 
  but in reality we can not . 
  there is no quick deal any more . 
  the window for that closed already . 
  political will can only do so much . 
  what we 're now looking at is a * new and third bailout program * . 
  and reaching an agreement on that will take time . 
  it will take time even if greece votes yes . 
  the call for a referendum after the deal expiration deadline has put greece into a limbo that will remain for some time irrespective the result . 
   no viable deal can be made without restructuring the debt . 
  you do know that debt restructuring has been on the table since 2012 ? 
  the condition has been for greece to make the reforms first . 
  i for one , as will many others , agree that greece will need debt restructuring in the long run . 
  but i will not agree with a deal where greece fails to actually implement the reforms it has already agreed to and gets debt relief . 
  and i think that is the actual point of disagreement here . 
  v-man should perfectly well know that the debt relief has been on the table for years but with the condition of reforms . 
  by his loud disagreement he seems to want debt relief without conditions . 
  and i do n't know why anyone else in the eurozone would or even should agree to that , especially when they 're the ones paying . 
   because his ideology is correct and austerity is simply a mistake . 
  so the correct action to address the -16 % deficit of the greek budget would not have been to cut the spending but some other way ? 
  what way ? 
  how would greece have covered their deficit when they could not get any financing from the markets except with very very high yields ? 
  actually greece did weight their options in 2009-10 . 
  they did consider defaulting under their debt . 
  they did consider leaving euro . 
  they did the calculations , even had people from the argentinian default helping them , and as the calculations showed that the defaulting route would be even more disastrous they decided to ask for emergency loans from eu/imf . 
  and it 's not like greece was forced to do it . 
  it was their decision . 
  well , had he spent the last six months standing in an atm queue instead of failing at governing there would not be capital controls now . 
  but if he is a nice guy why is he lying ? 
  because he has to ? 
  or because he actually believes it ? 
  if you actually read the list of reforms [ in the relevant document ] ( https://www.imf.org/external/np/loi/2014/grc/051414.pdf ) could you quote from there the ones that are ` ridiculous austerity based demands ' ? 
  is the troika 's demand of protecting the most vulnerable a ` ridiculous austerity based demand ' ? 
  is the idea that the pensioners should be registered by a single electronic database a ridiculous idea ? 
  to me what is ridiculous here is the fact that obvious things in need of fixing needs to be repeatedly pointed out by the creditors when they 're so obvious that any reasonable person , never mind a politician , should see the problem and the need of fixing it even without someone rubbing it to their face and demanding fixing it . 
   correct me if im wrong well , you 're wrong . 
  as i already said it needs to get accepted by the national parliaments . 
  and the finance ministers will certainly not accept a deal that has no chance of passing their parliaments . 
  i may be wrong in my speculation , but my chrystal ball says finland will get to be the next evil bad country destroying greece . 
  the finnish parliament will convene the next time only in september . 
  and even then the prospect of the parliament accepting a * third * bailout will be slim . 
   but surely the whole issue is that those ridiculous austerity based demands do n't work , have n't been working and would serve to further destroy the gdp of greece ? 
  is for example establishing a tax collection system that actually works a ` ridiculous austerity based demand ' ? 
  the list of necessary reforms has been very well defined since greece asked and accepted the second bailout program , and committed to implement those reforms . 
  yet after only six months in power they have introduced capital controls . 
  great success !, 
  such competence . 
  wow . 
  i hate their new site design . 
  it was so streamlined , easy to use , clean and fast before ... * sigh *, 
  well , what exactly are the relevant institutions that the german centre-right actually controls and how ? 
  and as they do n't control the national parliaments of all eurozone countries which ultimately accept or reject a deal as it should be , then how is it even relevant ? 
  your comment implied that - i will edit accordingly . 
  could you please list the relevant institutions that the german centre-right actually controls . 
  because it certainly does not control the institutions that would accept the deal . 
  the question is : what kind of an agreement would have had better than snowball 's chances in hell to get accepted by the national parliaments ? 
  let 's not simply forget democracy here . 
  there are 19 countries in the eurozone . 
  ~ ~ your claim ~ ~ you implying that the german centre-right controls for example the finnish parliament is , well , delusional . 
   i doubt that there will be liquidity problems . 
  there * already is * a liquidity problem . 
  the greek banks are closed and there are capital controls in place . 
   if ecb stops providing liquidity they are fucked , the ecb that is . 
  what do you mean ` if ' ? 
  the ecb has already frozen the ela ceiling and certainly can not rise the limit without breaking their mandate . 
  they wo n't rise it unless the situation improves dramatically . 
  and it 's certainly not the ecb that is having liquidy problems here , it 's the greek banks - in fact their problem is not merely restricted to a liquidy problem but extends to a solvency problem . 
  for example : [ referendum to determine future of greece 's banks , economists say ] ( http://cyprusbusinessmail.com/?p=10803 ) and on july 20 a bond repayment to the ecb will fall on greece . 
  i do n't know how they 're going to pay it with a no-vote . 
  hell , i do n't know how they are going to pay it with a yes-vote either . 
  i do n't think promising the moon to the voters should count as honesty . 
  that would be my first thought too . 
  he and tsipras certainly should be familiar with that reality . 
  yet also tsipras claimed in his speech yesterday that there would be a new deal ` immediately ' after the referendum . 
  might also be willingly dishonest . 
  also bloomberg tv . 
  their coverage has been top-notch with the interviews , analyses , reporters on location , discussions & debates , and market reactions . 
  my way of following this unfolding has been to open / r/europe , guardian live , bloomberg tv and a beer .

  when ussr collapsed they could start flaunting their ill-gained profits freely for the first time . 
  which is why the noveau-rich of 90 's russia have a certain ` reputation ' for going overboard with it . 
  well ... best korea has n't collapsed - yet and i really would n't count china as ` communistic ' anymore . 
  it 's more like an exercise in amalgamating what ever economical theories work to keep thing going in the name of the glorious party . 
  depends on the height , fall angle and what 's under your head ... 
  if you fall/slip uncontrollably backwards , the back of your head is almost every time the part that will hit the floor the hardest . 
  cops stopped hitting people on the head because killing man with a hit from a night stick or police baton to the head was about 60 % more likely than subduing him for arrest when done by inexperienced officers ... 
  so yeah it 's very common . 
  if you look closely you can see scaffolding at the top corner . 
  i think it was under renovation when the pic was taken . 
  the point seems to be that he does n't want to admit that brexiters are a bunch of diehard conservative pensioners from crumbling mining towns and rust belt cities . 
  the nakh peoples have been fighting for independence ever since the russians conquered the area from iran at late 1700 's . 
  like i 've said earlier the area is almost more trouble than its worth for russia to hold , but when has that stopped anyone that wants to hold land for the sake of holding it ? 
  probably . 
  to give a concrete example to you . 
  one of the hardiest mountain trees of greece the black pine - pinus nigra ... 
  i 've had an p. nigra austriaca variety which is from the alps , in my backyard at southern finland for 20 years now . 
  on last summer it finally reached the man 's height or 1,80 m. 
  really ? 
  what 's considered cold in greece because i 'm seeing houseplants in those planters ... 
  damn , but that handicap lift to akropolis is such an eyesore . 
  man , you 've got no idea how that thing is set to work if you really think that they detect metal in less than 100-200g clumps because if they did the machines would be screaming their `` heads off '' every single second from belt buckles , nail files , zippers , jewelry & coins ... everything that people normally carry in their clothes , pockets etc. 
  it would be an absolute nightmare at traffic hours . 
  they 're probably set to detect only larger objects such as guns or knives and bombs have almost no metal parts in them in the first place . 
  according to helsingin sanomat which quotes tass , they may have been homemade explosives with some kind of shrapnel included . 
  you know whats the real difference between a rebellion and an uprising ? 
  rate & level of success . 
  rebels are always those who do n't succeed and uprise are those which fulfill their goal ; be it an independence , toppling of existing government or any other usually political goal . 
  as the adage goes - one man 's insurgent is another mans rebel . 
  shah practically gifted over 70 % of iran 's oil to great britain , that 's why . 
  if chechnya did n't have oil fields , i doubt that anyone in russia would have really given a hoot when the chechen 's has their who know how many ` uprising ' in the 20th century alone around the 90 's . 
  chechnya has been a thorn in the bears foot ever since the czars had the not so smart idea to conquer the area for geopolitical reason back in the latter half of 1800 's . 
  oh my god [ ] ( #runningparrot ), 
  man , those are like the gnarliest birches i 've ever seen :|, 
  what spring , has been -5 c here the whole week ? 
  damn southeners always on a rush * grumble * edit : [ live feed ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrwln17cuus ) from my home town . 
  edit2 : [ yyteri beach ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dscuornkc0u ) by the sea slumbering beneath the ice waiting for summer . 
  funded by eu , well that counts the brits out then . 
  gone with the wind . 
  when the ground water is poisoned by tnt to the point that even grass does n't grow in those places ... 
  it pretty much destroys it . 
  go visit at the no-go zones of france for once and tell me how well of those places are . 
  people left when they had no work and no future , there 's only a fraction of populace left in those municipalities . 
  i never said the whole are is a third world but it is underdeveloped in comparison to rest of france . 
  i bet your ideas of africa is from the -70 's is n't it ? 
  in a way it is . 
  the world wars pretty much permanently destroyed many of the most productive parts of north-eastern france particularly around verdun and the area has never quite recovered . 
  but it 's good with fish & chips ... 
  because for the past 45 years britain has signed all their trade treaties in understanding and/or together with eec & eu . 
  those deals will now become nullified because soon britain will no longer follow the eu-rules on which those deals were based on . 
  trade deals made within the commonwealth will probably stay as they are as well as individual deals between states where eu market is n't involved . 
  ofc . 
  if may does the sensible thing and keeps most of the already negotiated & ratified eu-directives intact after brexit , it should be fairly easy to renew most of the current trade deals but then the whole `` brexit '' would seem like a sham to her voters ... 
  it 's no myth that sweden 's wars sucked finland dry . 
  as soon as finland became part of russia and the constant warring of swedish kings came to an end with the disastrous war of 1808-1809 . 
  once the warring stopped finland 's population tripled in less than a century from less than 1 million to three million ... 
  this even with the most disastrous natural famine in the history of europe ( by population loss ) . 
  well it 's not like he could do anything about them anyway , considering he is nothing more but a sock puppet . 
   they never cite a specific number for finland once in their commentary . 
  exactly !, 
  the point i was trying to made . 
  http://www.euro.who.int/__data/assets/pdf_file/0003/160680/e96457.pdf?ua=1 rather they left out from statistics ( 2009 ) that our consumption is actually 0.2 l below eu average and that was 8 years ago and has been in steady decline ever since . 
  awesome the rat is leaving the sinking ship !!!, 
  sure you still want out engl\u00e4nder ? 
  then they leave out the fact that the report is from 2009 ... which is n't the report you 're showing btw . 
  and that alcohol consumption has dropped 0.6 % and is in decline for 4th year in a row and that according to latest survey kids rather smoke weed then drink booze . 
  also before probation finland was one of the least drinking countries in the world which just goes to show how successful that whole probation craze was in the long run . 
  estonia pissed on it 's own corn flakes and we 're now heading to latvia for cheap beer and liquor . 
  it 's not like you can just legalize drugs because un-agreement from -53 banned the open sales and recreational use of most opioid drugs , including heroin which was legal pharmaceutic in finland until -56 . 
  so no , you ca n't just `` make '' all drugs legal , it 's an international agreement to ban them and changing that requires an international agreement from un member states . 
  they 're also some of the worlds most popular cheese types or where 'd you think the names come from ? 
  i have an old radio that says made in east-germany . 
  they know this in us as well and more `` made in italy '' olive oil is sold in the us then italy produces in a year because `` italian olive oil '' sells like hot cakes instead of say turkish , greese or spanish . 
  that is everyone ships their olive oil to be canned in italy to get the label . 
  as long as we do n't talk about manufacturing machinery anyway ` english ' is a curse word in those circles because always some trange thinga ma bob 's that everyone else have as easy , understandable and most of all serviceable or like the german technician called it `` i do n't know !, 
  english !!!! '', 
  or they have that fucking timing flywheel with switches and bumps just to make your life miserable when the machine starts to lag on timing for what ever reason . 
  italians are considered fancy but also very flimsy , east-block is 40 years old made from cast iron , durable with controls that shy any parts of the modern technology but most of all cheap like this czech cnc thing made by t.o.s here that looks like a manual machine with ( german ! ), 
  heidenhein controls just slapped on it to make it sell in the west after the fall of commie block which is about the age of the machine as well . 
  just a few examples . 
  and you know why it is n't ? 
  because the greek literally blackmailed it by announcing that unless they 'd get all feta made in eu designated to be greek-specialty they 'd block finland , sweden & austria from joining because joining to ec ( later eu ) required unanimous acceptance from all members . 
  that 's why we have hundreds of `` salad cheese '' brands sold all across eu and only a few `` feta '' . 
  greece used to produce only 2 % of all feta sold in eu . 
  making it specialty was comparable to ban all but the netherland to sell cheese as edam in eu . 
  imo feta is a generic cheese type just like edam , maasdam & emmental for example . 
  the fun part ... british invented made in germany at the 1800 's to encourage their citizens to curtail smuggling and to get them buy more british products by forcing their `` enemies '' to visibly label their exports . 
  unfortunately anything british was so shitty that it completely backfired and even when britain tried to lift the ruling it was still printed and everyone soon followed suit after realizing how such ` branding ' could boost sales . 
  just start calling it memel again , that was the name of the autonomous state before ww2 : edit : hmm , i was sure memel & k\u00f6nigsberg were in the same territory ... uups . 
  navalny has climbed to a position where simply disposing of him permanently is n't going to work . 
  i think they 'll go hodorkovsky on him and ` break ' him with 10-20 years in prison from some trumped up charges & kangaroo court . 
  sometimes i get the feeling that he might be poking ` the bear ' on purpose just to see how far he could go and possibly become ' a martyr ' in the process , both would cement him as the ` face ' for the opposition which for a career politician is quite helpful . 
   i could also draw , i dunno , babies giving blowjobs to each other and that would be weird and off-putting as well . 
  difference is that you would get jail time for publishing that and you would also get your face in the sex offender registry with all the social stigma that entails . 
  not that it was that much different for actual gays when it was still classified as mental illness and sodomy . 
  no more pot belly moomin ... and right now moomin troll 's parents are arguing about whose bright idea it was to allow moomin troll to access the internet . 
  wonder how much they pay for the poor bastard who mows that lawn each week ? 
  that 's because the official name was `` sosialististen neuvostotasavaltojen liitto '' or `` federation of socialist council republics '' . 
  umm no eduskunta means representatives while riksdag means valtiop\u00e4iv\u00e4t or state days and there has n't been valtiop\u00e4iv\u00e4t since the russian rule ended in 1917 . 
  erdo 's head is so big and full of hot air that i 'd bet him carrying stones in his pockets for ballast .

  i mean the racism is unfortunate , not the homogeneity itself . 
  no matter how short it might be . 
  why would it be banned ? 
  it 's kinda inconvenient though . 
  mosques often ( usually ? ), 
  are more than just `` muslim churches '' , but community centers and whatnot . 
  ( like our seurakuntatalo ) . 
  so having one build away from the user base is n't that wise . 
  not to even get in on how hard it would be to sell the same space for both of these purposes , try selling it to people living near such a place . 
  if people do n't want a rehab center or a mosque near them , trying to build both might be quite difficult . 
  it 's not surprising but it 's still unfortunate . 
  though things are changing . 
  i think they might have us beat . 
  but we 're supposed to be hating muslims here , ca n't you see !, 
  you used to be religious , then happy fun-time called communism happened . 
  it 's silly until you need it . 
  no , we can actually handle our alcohol . 
  we handle it so well that 's it 's no problem using it throughout the week , constantly . 
  i do n't know , i often sell beer to my dumbass friends who forget that shops stop selling alcohol at 9pm . 
  there are . 
  junkies are prone to stealing stuff . 
  and having one built close lowers the property value , partly because of this . 
  never forget . 
  just remember to bring the rest of your tanks . 
  i think we 've all come to expect that of you . 
  * ^ ^ snobby ^ ^ laughter *, 
   assholes [ ... ] dickheads #  well put hehehe, 
  uncivilized savage detected . 
  time to unify you in diversity !, 
  it was a mess on all accounts , so saying it was a 1v1 is definitely not right . 
  was n't really 1v1 though . 
  poland won , that much is true . 
  but there was the russian civil war , the whole ukraine thing and whatnot going on , so it 's a bit dishonest to say it was a straight up soviet union vs poland war . 
  one can always dream . 
  if you get moscow ( again ) , we want glorious finnic lands . 
  and urals . 
  for what the un and security council was meant for , they 've done a pretty good job in my opinion . 
  not that i do n't think something should be done about russia , but poland for real , at this point you should know how that fight will go . 
  i just do n't want to see you getting hurt again . 
  we 'll be seeing this on cnn soon . 
  ah , that explains it . 
  the what now ? 
  it 's like with mobile operating systems : you need people to use it to get apps . 
  you need apps to get people to use it . 
  they 're trying to get the people and hope that apps ( or in this case , jobs and whatnot ) will follow . 
  and maybe they will , if they trust this plan will be successful . 
  nevertheless , sounds pretty cool . 
  it 'd be interesting to move to far east and have some land in the middle of nowhere . 
  be a modern day cowboy , hah . 
  what do you need internet for when you get a girl like in the article ? 
   it 's colder there than it is in finland do people think it 's very cold in here or is this comparison based on just geographical location ? 
  you know things are bad when you need an american to correct someone 's geography . 
  ca n't argue with that , hah . 
  well , both sides wanted to invade sweden and they managed to stay out of the fighting and make money in the meantime . 
  sounds like a good deal to me . 
  i was thinking of those `` walk this straight line '' , `` follow my finger with your eyes '' things , in addition to/instead of breathalyzer . 
  honestly , nowadays it 's the complete opposite . 
  people love to be contrarian , even if the contrarian side is the loudest . 
  i 've never heard this stereotype of swedes . 
  and i 'd like to think i 'm fairly up-to-date with my swedish stereotypes . 
  as a side note , do police do that silly `` drunk test '' here in europe ? 
  i have never heard of it happening in finland . 
  it seems so old fashioned . 
  i 've only seen it on american police shows and whatnot . 
  someone said to me that failing that test gives the police `` probable cause '' to test you and such , but i have no idea how true that is . 
  `` he said he smokes weed . 
  we checked if he has weed . 
  he had weed . '', 
  am i being detained ?!? 
  am i free to go !?!, 
  what , i thought this was america !, 
  well then . 
  ehh , i 'm still living in the afterglow of 6-1 . 
  ah , the prodigal son . 
  easier to just say `` tuoppi '' . 
  ( which i think means `` pint '' . ), 
  `` tuoppi '' `` nelj\u00e4viiskymment '' `` mmm '' that 's my interaction at a bar counter . 
  how * dare * you, 
  swedes are excellent at cop dramas . 
  the one thing i 'm truly jealous of sweden . 
  it sounds extreme to them , since their languages are just so goddamn girlish . 
  i love the se/dk/no thing . 
  haha , you have to share , we get our own thing !, 
  suck it !, 
  viro has our back . 
  love u viro < 3, 
  i kinda hate your stupid ass island , letting armies from na invade my precious europe . 
  can confirm , i got so much done on my cabin . 
  sure you did . 
  sure you did ... 
    just slightly bigger than denmark , netherlands , switzerland and finland . 
  oh wow , estonia is a lot larger than i thought . 
  ( edit after 9 hours : estonia is n't actually larger than finland . 
  i was just joking . 
  viro small , but viro still in our hearts . ), 
  viro is also more fun to say drunk . 
  you 'd expect an american to see the benefit of tying russia to us financially . 
  peace through prosperity and whatnot . 
  hey , worked with other european countries . 
  though russia is unlike the others .

  it 's happy in a typically finnish melancholic fashion . 
  the current national anthem is inspired by a german drinking song , which is less glorious . 
  how far north ? 
  fuck yeah it is !, 
  amazing that someone 's first introduction to europe was in my neighborhood . 
  and this is because conservatives do n't think climate change is an issue . 
  i find it funny that it 's gurka in swedish and agurk in norwegian . 
  the a ca n't decide where it belongs . 
  what , did you annex the netherlands again ? 
  depends entirely on your bedroom curtains . 
  you forgot booze . 
  it goes well with all three . 
  they actually do . 
  andorra : small population , mountainous which means people get regular exercise , mediterranean diet , access to healthcare in neighboring countries in more complicated cases . 
  iceland : again , small population , access to eu healthcare in complicated cases , food and alcohol is prohibitively expensive so people tend to rethink their purchases . 
  switzerland : outdoorsy people in a mountainous country with food prices that give you a headache . 
  i 'm sure your politicians want it to be a proper english breakfast and none of that healthy continental garbage . 
  and denmark was shat out of chalk and water . 
   why does europe have to be a super power ? 
  why is n't a defensive treaty satisfactory ? 
  we need it to protect ourselves . 
  we 're currently the only major economy that is at least semi-seriously trying to bring down our carbon footprints . 
  i 'm generally against neoimperialism but this time it 's necessary for the survival of our species . 
  same goes for human rights , now that trump is president . 
  the us administration , russia , and turkey all hate us . 
  when you do n't have any powerful friends left , you have to man up yourself . 
   why should there be a unified command structure when the army is comprised of separate sovereign states with their own foreign policies . 
  who would control it ? 
  we need a unified command because it needs to act as one entity , not as splintered brigades with each their own objectives and interests . 
  this is the very reason we need a common army in the first place : strength through unity . 
  finland , even though it 's a bilingual country , always gives its military commands in finnish so that everyone gets the same message . 
  if the nyland brigade got different instructions from all the other brigades , there 'd be no cohesion . 
  see what i mean ? 
  an eu army would probably work like nato where member nations have to invoke an article , calling others to help , from where the war effort will be led by a unified command . 
   nato . 
  when the us president says nato is obsolete , nato is obsolete . 
  europe can no longer rely on american support . 
  nato is built upon unwavering trust , and that trust does not exist anymore . 
   save money on what ? 
  european armies have overlapping investments and operations . 
  if we bring everyone under the same roof , we can coordinate everything better . 
  we need one big group effort , not 28 ( 27 ? ), 
  separate half-assed attempts . 
   very few countries hit the minimum 2 % gdp expenditures on defense for nato anyways . 
  we need to change this . 
  pronto . 
   europe already has a defensive alliance . 
  yes and no . 
  the eu requires member states to aid one another upon attack but the type and extent of help is not specified . 
  one country might send 15 teddy bears , name it humanitarian aid , and call it a day . 
  that is not enough . 
  czechia and slovenia can into west . 
  gulags helped in the fight for survival how exactly ? 
  the shortlist or the blacklist ? 
  google translate 's audio has gotten pretty good recently . 
  just press on the speaker icon . 
  literally over a million soviet soldiers were sent to finland to be slaughtered by our army . 
  and what for ? 
  they definitely were n't protecting themselves against the nazis . 
  the nazis came after their first attack . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/winter_war https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/continuation_war, 
  of course !, 
  loss of human life is always a tragedy and it should never be forgotten . 
  i 'm just not comfortable with calling this a victory when humanity went from one dark place to another . 
  this is the victory of a murderous oppressive regime over another . 
  the soviets killed many of my relatives and forced the rest into exile . 
  they enslaved our cousins to the south and divided our continent into two , killing 20 million while at it . 
  there is absolutely nothing joyful in the picture for me . 
  both stalin and hitler killed millions of people . 
  neither should be celebrated . 
  fuck this post . 
  only denmark is turned 90 \u00b0 , the other ones have been stretched on the y-axis , though . 
  the british flag is too complicated and small to comment on , though . 
  good !, 
  yes , the backside is what i mean . 
  the other side varies , though . 
  my dutch ehic has my health insurance provider 's logo and my customer number while the finnish ehic has information on what the card entitles you to . 
  here in the netherlands , i got one from my health insurance provider automatically . 
  in finland , you get them from the government and you have to ask for them . 
  i have two now . 
  if you are an eu citizen , get an ehic . 
  get it now . 
  i ca n't stress this enough . 
  he could have waved a couple times . 
  i understand that hypocrisy is a big issue with my argumentation but overpopulation is a global problem that should have been dealt with much much earlier . 
  we simply can not sustain 10 billion people as a planet if everyone starts striving for a quality of life equivalent to that of europe , which is now happening in china . 
  women having an education and pursuing a career is the number one way to bring down the birth rate , and it 's frankly too late now . 
  who knows , we could have even eradicated conservative strains of religions if we had pushed for it a hundred years ago . 
  never said it was . 
  besides colonization itself , one of europe 's biggest mistakes was not educating women and bringing birthrates down in our colonies . 
  climate change and africa 's problems would be a lot easier to solve if the human population had n't absolutely exploded in the past century . 
  it tripled . 
  so did spain , iceland , and the netherlands . 
  nothing too whacky . 
  but then again your unfortunate 20th century history made the outskirts less enticing for tourists . 
  i can tell that you 've never lived in a place with a lot of tourists . 
  how * dare * you make us suffer the consequences of our reckless decision ? 
  watch the video , though . 
  it 's a light-hearted jab . 
  one could even call it banter .

  i do n't support antifa , but they 're fun to put overtop the finnish resistance movement stickers just to trigger em , since our city does n't have any antifa people .

  not really , but you guys annoy me sometimes . 
   nationalists are fucking idiots . 
  that 's rude . 
  there might also be some other reason why women ca n't compete . 
  what about them ? 
  i believe most of them can speak the main language of the country they 're living . 
  i think it 's more about the language we speak + geography . 
  icelanders are n't scandi 's either . 
  no i meant that of the refugees we have , like 5 % are syrian . 
  we have our own problems to deal with . 
  and syrians represent like 5 % of the refugees we have . 
  most of them are iraqis on some europe sight-seeing tour , plenty of them have already left because this is n't a wonderland after all . 
  add rapes committed by them , constant fighting in the refugee centers , and lots of whining on their part . 
  that 's 30k too many if you ask me . 
  we have about 30k . 
  your thinking is a little creepy . 
  lol i fucking wish we had only 750 to 1050 . 
  can we add estonia ? 
  need alcohol . 
  is it like in finland where literally every political party fucking sucks ? 
  [ look red ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ea/conscription_map_of_the_world.svg ) for conscription , not that i know exactly how it 's done in those countries , but conscription is a thing in many countries . 
  i remember one winter night , near the arctic circle , i had to sit outside with a radio headset on in case someone would call ( nobody did n't ) , and the wire on that was so short that i had to sit on my backpack , could n't move at all . 
  just sitting there for hour or two , i was shivering the whole time , too dark to see anything , tired as fuck . . then the hallucinations came . 
  fun times . 
  in finland you are n't forced to join the army , you can do civilian service , or unarmed military service if that 's the problem . 
  in finland you can do civilian service instead , you get send to help schools/hospitals etc. 
  did my conscription last year and did n't notice any hazing , not saying there is n't , but nowadays there 's pretty clear 0 tolerance for that kind of stuff . 
  it was an issue when my dad was in the army , and they literally had some fight clubs in the parking lot before weekend holiday officially ended . 
  just guys beating the shit out of each other because they served in a different branch . 
   it 's basically mandated slavery , where the government exercises its right to own its citizens and deprive them of their freedom against their will . 
  is n't that like school ? 
  yeah , you can start your conscription in the summer or in the winter , ( roughly 6 months between ) , those who become nco 's get to train the new guys . 
  it 's our pronunciation that 's terrible . 
  you need someone to build the wall if mexicans back out . 
  [ relevant ] ( http://bloviatingzeppelin.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/sharpton-speaks.jpg ), 
  that picture shows total gun deaths were lower in 2013 compared to 2008 ? 
  what 's the point of this article ? 
  majority of gun deaths are suicides , that 's much better way to end yourself than head-on collision with a truck , another popular method . 
  [ russian diplomacy now ] ( http://static.fjcdn.com/pictures/k+from+rome+total+war_9b2fc9_4162073.png ), 
  yup . 
  are we gon na let in every poor person ? 
  or just take few of them and imagine we made a difference ? 
  `` guys , i went to europe and got 400k $ !, 
  how amazing is that ? '' . 
  incoming refugees . 
  finnish lapland has more santa clauses than swedish one though . 
  sorry but that 's just retarded and you know it . 
  sweden is n't that stupid , this is a long-term plan . 
  think few decades to the future when these guys might start paying taxes and working as engineers and whatnot . 
  [ american ] ( http://assets.dwell.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_photo/public/2014/04/22/nevada-suburb-aerial-photo-ciphers.jpg?itok=nexqlncd ) [ suburbs ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/82/30/1e/82301e3406c0f330efe7e59b8ba65bba.jpg ) though i quite like [ this ] ( http://www.photographsofthewest.org/education/content_photos/hirez/123.jpg ) picture , like an oasis in the desert . 
  they might be afraid of other men after being raped by men . 
  what about males that are raped by males ? 
  should they be put in women 's section ? 
  but that would be too spooky for women . 
  thanks for the history lesson , i meant fair as in white . 
  there has been plenty of rapes in finland , fights and stabbings in the refugee shelters . 
  when cops go to break up fights , they get no respect from them . 
  there was an article some weeks ago how cops went to refugee shelter and got surrounded by `` angry men '' , had to use gas to get out . 
  yea yea not everyone is like that , but not everyone is some poor syrian who wants only to get to a safe place . 
  is n't that what hitler said ? 
  you mean copied from that one guy who actually did his homework ? 
  dream big . 
  what 's next ? 
  let me guess , borders ? 
  thanks , but no tanks . 
  do it like we did in the military , applause lasts only 2 seconds . 
  of course , but antifa folk have their own definitions on who is a nazi . 
  `` nazis '' meaning everyone we do n't like . 
  to be fair , everything is incredibly expensive . 
  our president [ on airspace violations ] ( https://youtu.be/knp2vj2yfgu?t=3m22s ) . 
  is n't your conscription selective ? 
  there was an article about how many gays are voting for fn too . 
  he could 've joined a pmc if he wanted guns and dangerous situations . 
  or you know , just travelling . 
   what will happen once these populists come to power ? 
  in finland 's case , nothing . 
  i guess singapore could be one . 
  but i think even their quasi-dictator said that you ca n't integrate muslims or something along that . 
  and i doubt you 'd be willing to adopt the `` break the law = get fucked '' system . 
  [ teaser ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svabpir0wls ) , add some zombie noises . 
  there is short tv show ( i think 3 episodes ) called generation war/unsere m\u00fctter , unsere v\u00e4ter . 
  it 's from german perspective and on the eastern front , it 's more of a drama than war film but i recommend it anyways . 
  [ trailer ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmygpx23px4 ), 
  i just think that winter would be kind of boring . 
  99 % of the scenes would look like [ this ] ( http://sofrep.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/winter-war-finnish-ski-troops.jpg ) or [ this ] ( http://www.flamesofwar.com/portals/0/all_images/modelling/sculp-finns-02.jpg ) ( in color ) . 
  compared to scenes form band of brothers , [ here ] ( http://www.highdefdiscnews.com/screenshots/band_of_brothers_8.png ) and [ here ] ( http://hboasiaweb.s3.amazonaws.com/band-of-brothers-e3-t.jpg ) . 
  i mean yeah , unfair comparison but still . 
  i do n't think winter would be that nice fit from aesthetic perspective when it 's just that , snow . 
  not sure if you could make it an exciting tv show . 
  snow everywhere and people in winter camos crouching in a foxhole or skiing around . 
  there are no/very few innocent people on those videos , and it seems like those people had no intention of actually trying to kill as many as possible . 
  in the 2nd video , do n't you think it 's a bit ridiculous that you have dozens of cops and they all back off then the crazy person walks towards them ? 
  so if a person with heavy clothing and a mask would run around stabbing people ( and not stopping to taunt police ) in a pedestrian heavy area , the cops would actually charge at him ? 
  and let 's say there 's only few cops at the scene , not an small army of them . 
  i do n't wan na bring gun policy to this , but that seems like very inefficient and dangerous for all parties . 
  discussion about armed police ? 
  remember to use only us and uk as your examples . 
  are your police actually trained to attack a person with knife ? 
  what if he would wear clothing that prevented tazer working properly and would run after those other people ? 
  if eu were to become a super power , we would need to be more unified rather than everybody being independent .

  we see similar acts across islamic world . 
  the only places where such acts are not supported within sharia is former soviet states and to an extent turkey . 
   interpreting a religion like islam literally means having no life . 
  it 's impossible to function . 
  factually false . 
  many states function today under sharia . 
  as in right now , as of typing this . 
  and not just in the middle east , there are quite a few asian states in this basket as well . 
   if you actually bothered to read the rest of my post , you should notice that my argument actually minimally relies on the cherry-picking observation per se . 
  actually it literally hinges on this argument , and if this argument is false has no basis whatsoever . 
  so far you have done nothing but spammed lie after lie on the topic . 
  i have no interest in engaging ( or more accurately , just debunking lies you keep spamming as fast as you can into this thread ) any further . 
  debunking of all lies you have thrown into the threat so far has been exhaustively done by large amount of people who specialize on the topic . 
  i have no interest in merely rehashing the same dance of debunking the torrent of lies . 
  i also have no interest in going over all the same lies as you continue to inevitably apply postmodernist logic to everything , allowing you to justify that black is indeed white and argue from that position . 
  good day . 
   all followers of the religion cherry-pick and hold their intellectually-unconvincing interpretations ; isis included . 
  factually false , and your entire argument hinges on this . 
  there are plenty of discussion on why you are wrong on this across the reputable sources on the internet when it comes to is . 
   islam is n't specific on anything . 
  in your case , saying holds true . 
  we 're done . 
  to be fair , they probably secretly love you for it , when they begin the conquest . 
  people following text on the other hand have both the agency , and the text to strengthen their position . 
  which brings me back to my original point yet again :  while people can in fact not obey the rules , that makes them heretics if they follow them , but incorrectly , or apostates if they still claim to follow the religion , while directly dismissing direct orders from the religious teachings . 
  and islam is quite specific on what must be done to heretics and apostates , and people with agency who are followers of islam do indeed follow them . 
  because they are religious people , rather than postmodernist `` black can be white if we just talk about it enough '' bullshitters . 
  religion is a set of specific rules . 
  islam is special among religions in that its rules are according to its teachings `` unerring , universally correct '' and its very name demands following these rules as the name of the religion is literally `` submission '' . 
  while people can in fact not obey the rules , that makes them * heretics * if they follow them , but incorrectly , or * apostates * if they still claim to follow the religion , while directly dismissing direct orders from the religious teachings . 
  as noted above . 
  the reference is `` to match us army in europe '' . 
  not `` overall '' . 
  this is often lost without context . 
  that is exactly why she and people like her want it . 
  us is not going to function as a security guarantor forever , and frankly , it 's a good time to get over the shame of world war two and realise that world is not going to be west-centric for much longer if current trends persist . 
  that means we need to start building up the military capacity to stand up to whoever makes the rules in post-pax americana world . 
  history dictates that those who do not prepare , end up as colonies and vassals , de facto or de jure . 
  this bs is getting tiring . 
  the state structures are still implementing all the laws and policies set by previous governments . 
  there is simply no current government setting new policies , something results of which will not be felt for quite a significant period of time . 
  civ is a pretty optimistic view on humanity in general . 
  fascism is a pretty good and very workable system in it for example , as is communism . 
  islam is a missionary religion . 
  it is a task incumbent upon * every muslim * to spread it to those who have not submitted to allah yet . 
  she is merely following her religion , unlike her apostate `` moderate '' brethren . 
  problem with this line of thinking is that you consider eu as kind of a table full of food , which is obliged to provide you with dishes delicious enough for free every once in a while , so that beast of islamism residing in your country can be kept sated and tame . 
  that is exactly what lead eu to its current state , where in many nation states that form the eu , large minorities and even small majorities are now against the union itself . 
  people do not like it when they are abused in the name of the `` but outsiders need our help '' ideal . 
  and it 's normal to expect your state to take care of your needs as a citizen first , before they begin spending massive amount of resources on helping outsiders . 
  people will tolerate it for a while , but not forever . 
  especially when outsiders behave like turkey , and consistently show their contempt for the same related values and like to chest beat over their history of conquest of the same people . 
  and that time has largely ran out in case of eu . 
  too many people are no longer willing to tolerate this . 
  and turkey 's behaviour in fact demonstrated exactly what the people advocating for excluding turkey kept warning everyone about - that the islamist culture and legacy of ottoman empire is too deeply rooted and will rise the moment eu stops actively feeding the beast with money and hope . 
  and it 's better to face the beast as it is when it 's still outside your house , than when it already penetrated the walls and is on the inside . 
  notably , that is also the problem you are having . 
  you wish for the suppression of that same beast we do , but you are in fact locked in that same house . 
  that is why you would have preferred that your problems would in fact be eu 's problems , because that would give you a chance of solving them in a way beneficial to you , as it would be our collective problem , and you and your supporters would not be a minority in relevant institutions . 
  and while i fully support you in this resistance , i like any sane person prefer to keep such beasts outside , with minimal possible influence on internal politics . 
  with eu as weak as it is due to massive overreach and essential ignoring of locals in favour of immigrating people and overreaching goals on its expansion , it simply can no longer afford that kind of overreach . 
  if eu were to try doing what you would like it to do in relation to turkey , it would destroy itself , because nation states would simply refuse to expose themselves further to these risks . 
  that is the unfortunate reality . 
  i will point out the same thing i recently pointed out to another bulgarian poster that had essentially carbon copy of your complaint , but in relation to his country : you are complaining that eu did not pressure your country into doing things that were against the will of the government and the people . 
  when eu does it , it 's eu 's fault . 
  when eu does n't do it , it 's eu 's fault . 
  how about `` turkey and overwhelming amount of turks that vote for erdogan have their own opinions , and they do what they like . 
  and if you do n't like it , take it up with them , and not us for not being despotic enough toward them '' . 
  of course , you never will do this , because they are not like us and they will not tolerate you or your complaints . 
  `` if you have a different view from mine , you are an ignorant bigot and i have mainstream media narrative to prove it ! '', 
  a good example of a person ignorant of their own bigotry . 
  that was the hysterical media interpretation of the day . 
  officials released a statement almost immediately stating that media clearly blew the issue out of proportions and that problem was under control . 
  essentially they were talking about the boom during 2008-2012 when russians were buying out property near border for holiday and tourism . 
  and one building purchased was right next to a border agency 's building , and the intended tourist trap did n't materialise , likely due to lack of funds post-2012 . 
  so much for that `` scandal '' . 
  essentially the only points of disagreements between these are : 1 . 
  major shia-sunni split that is causing the civil war that has been ongoing within muslim world for over millenia over `` who is the legitimate leader '' . 
  the rest are minor differences that mainly are scholarly items such as `` can we execute the heretic immediately , or do we have to wait for three days is heretic is a woman '' . 
  i 'm not kidding . 
  that one of the key theological differences between some of the sunni schools listed on that map . 
  this in no way mirrors the christian sects , which are so massively different on basics of theology ( i.e. 
  what language service should be held in , are there any saints after christ ) that in islam , any such difference would make school of thought automatically heretical and not islamic . 
  superpowers are not interested in your opinions , much less permissions . 
  i 'm interested in basis why you chose to not interact with my point , and instead provided an example which is in fact directly analogous . 
  we and cattle we keep generally reproduce through very similar mechanisms . 
  females are the bottleneck of reproductive amounts . 
  if you 're slicing up russia , why did n't you give us our right arm back ? 
  yes . 
  but as before , it 's an illiberal democracy . 
  it 's just even less liberal than before . 
  we have our own war history , that is far more relevant . 
  so yes , it does in fact matter . 
  consider using actual examples of actual states , instead of desperately trying to jury-rig an awful analogy from a completely different region with completely different geopolitical situation . 
  i just want to point out that you 're complaining that * eu has n't forced your country to do things against its elected leaders ' will * . 
  no , it really has n't . 
  these kinds of changes are on the surface . 
  fighting corruption takes decades even in best case scenario . 
  it 's not enough to cut off the branches . 
  you have to find and destroy the roots .

  the water has to be at least so-good , there can only be so-and-so many leaks per year , certain quality standards have to be maintained etc. 
  there are water companies in ( almost ) all the countries of the world . 
  in majority of them , however , water is not drinkable without boiling . 
  in some , not even with boiling . 
  edit : and we are directly paying circa 2 000 million euros for road and railway infrastructure maintenance per year , out of state budget of 55 0000 million euros , circa 4 % . 
  this is not enough to upkeep the infrastructure , that has been slowly deteriorating since the depression of early 90s . 
  for example , we do n't have money to build the new rail up to oulu , which is very important -- even essential -- for trade with swedish and finnish lapland , particularly after we started mining there . 
  not to mention stuff like the traffic control system at helsinki railway station ( most of the vr-jokes are largely about our current system , best descriptive with the word `` historical '' ) or the maintenance of the motorways , which are also getting worse by the year , etc. 
  football fields and regional roads are maintained from the county budget . 
  they do n't cost much , but then , the counties are even cutting on libraries , schools and basic medical services , so paying for county maintenance [ kaupunkitekniikka ] to cut the grass , repavement and other upkeep will surely not be left untouched . 
  still , calling the axis and its ( willing or not ) allies a federation is a rather strong claim . 
  edit : based on your downvotes , you actually believe italy , vichy france , germany and finland were a federation ? 
  really ? 
   well , i do n't think anything is stopping finland from changing their tax laws . 
  eu-directives . 
  plus state coffins being emptyish , they would look happily on money transfer from the provinces . 
   helsinki would lose the possibility to siphon off the plant 's profits , but that 's dirty business , anyway . 
  currently , the electricity plant is used to heavily supplement the taxation income and to maintain services that few other cities in finland can afford . 
  the blogpost continues by soininvaara drafting a plan under which the new city-owned incorporated power plant would be heavily in dept to the city , thus never making anything to tax . 
  it 's a similar arrangement to double irish with dutch sandwich , only without caymans . 
  be as it may , thus it works , at least in finland . 
  [ here 's a reference ] ( http://www.soininvaara.fi/2010/04/23/helsingin-energian-voitot-verolle/ ) to blogpost made by osmo soininvaara , who among other things , sits in the helsinki city council and is also a member of the parliament . 
  he 's also the former minister of public health services and has a degree in statistics . 
  not exactly a demagogue , is what i 'm saying . 
  translated ,  the state government demands , due to eu , that the city of helsinki incorporates its powerplant . 
  this would mean that the earnings of the plant , 300 million $ , would be taxable income . 
  helsinki would lose 80 million euros per year . 
  this has popped up in the news and blogposts of high-ranking politicians the past few years . 
  i 'd say that if they were uninformed or lying , somebody would have caught to it by now . 
  that 's great to hear !, 
  however , my town 's municipal electricity and water plants works superbly while also priding themselves for offering very cheap service , while the privately owned electricity companies on the next town over ca n't say the same . 
  so you can see why i would be concerned , 
  my point exactly . 
  the town 's water plant is n't a business . 
  it 's a service , similar to library or schools . 
  this is a heated topic in my part of the woods because the local electricity plant has to be incorporated due to eu ( the city does n't plan to sell it , simply to incorporate it and keep all the stock ) . 
  however , the price of the electricity will ( according to politicians ) raise due to suddenly several taxes will be applied . 
  but municipal-owned private company has to pay taxes , while municipal service is tax-free . 
  the difference is 10-20 % addition to the price of water . 
  yeah , but does n't state owned company also use all the profits to fix these things ? 
  what can private monopoly do better than state monopoly ? 
  i think i have a huge bias against european languages that do n't use the roman alphabets . 
  makes me feel like illiterate . 
  at least with french and italian i can read the words aloud and sometimes even make guesses on the meanings . 
  it 's also somewhat harder to fire people in most european countries than usa . 
  even in places with just the owner and one employee , the employee has a lot of bargaining power . 
  thank you for digging that much !, 
  ah yes , forgot that one . 
  thank you for correcting me . 
   yeah , let 's all prepare for things we do n't expect to ever eventuate . 
  the power plant would have been in danger of failing for any earthquake bigger than 7 . 
  this was known from 2007 and there had been several strong suggestions from iaea to make the changes , but tepco resisted . 
  few times they even got japanese government to resist court-orders . 
  for context ; earthquakes bigger than 8 have happened five times since the end of ww2 . 
  any of those could have done the same if they had happened in the right place . 
  so yeah , perhaps there was n't anything they could have done to resist 9.5 earthquake -- but even if the earthquake would have been a meager 8 in the same spot , this would still have happened . 
  and those odds are n't astronomical . 
  that 's like hoping a tornado does n't take your house in the us midwest . 
  it 's an ok bet when you are gambling on a cardboard-house , quite something else when that house includes a nuclear reactor . 
  please read how tepco had dealed with security concerns the previous ten years . 
  yeah , i should have remembered the hyphens . 
  us states lost a lot of freedom after their civil war . 
  before that , they were `` almost '' independent from a perspective of `` sovereign '' eu-state . 
  i suppose the point is still sore for them . 
  please make sure that whatever you find about the subject also passes to me . 
  i 'm keenly interested . 
  afaik , east prussia was very solidly german since before dawn of time . 
  russians just did an ethnic cleaning , destroyed all marks of german rule and renamed the area . 
  i suppose you mean nokia-the-company , not [ nokia-the-town-with-shit-water ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nokia_water_supply_contamination ) . 
  because if you are , i do n't want to hear about it , 
  you should perhaps ask this at / r/askhistorians , but remember that these were the years of 30-year war . 
  germany was far from peace . 
  disregarding that , the dukedoms had big enough population density and central cities that allowed each area to have their own identity - not to mention enough firepower to protect it . 
  the only real power was austria ( eg . 
  the emperor ) , but they did n't have the strength to do anything as the ottomans were the bigger threat . 
  and as you probably know , this thing `` national thing '' never went anywhere . 
  the divisions remained till german confederation and bismarck tricking the dukes into forming the german empire . 
  hitler had trouble in keeping the dukedoms in line and tried to rule germany as one unit , which did n't really work . 
  and after ww2 the former duchies became states in the german federation . 
  afaik , they have far more independence than the states in usa . 
  but i 'm not german . 
  perhaps somebody here would want to correct me . 
  would be always fun to know more . 
  the main thing is that we beat sweden !, 
  true that . 
  thanks for the example . 
  far better than mine . 
  would you happen to have a link that i could save for later sharing ? 
  you realise the panic was n't over tsunamis , but due to nuclear companies hiding known weak points ? 
  the idea was that if they had fucked up with tsunamis in japan ( which was like forgetting it snows in finland ) , how had things been handled in europe ? 
  the fact that the french fucked up repeatedly while building the [ olkiluoto 3 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/olkiluoto_nuclear_power_plant#unit_3 ) nuclear reactor in finland ( construction started in 2005 ; should have been ready in 2009 ; current projected date late 2015 ) did n't really help improve the appearances . 
  the main threat was n't the tsunamis . 
  it was the lack of trust on the constructors and the operators . 
  germany/eu was busy converting to green energy with set target dates ( [ of which you can read here ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/energy_policy_of_the_european_union ) ) when japan happened and it was decided that until the conversion was finished , it was better to hang with coal than nuclear . 
  but we 're still on line to meet the 20 % target for 2020 and apparently 95 % renewable by 2050 is still possible as well . 
  so no , it was n't just propaganda . 
  we were and we still are converting to renewables . 
  due to japan-factor we back-pedalled a bit with co-emissions , but even this can be spun positively if you really want propaganda ; you see : wind , wave-energy is not stable . 
  you can augment this with water-power ( dams ) but we must have a bigger amount of wind and wave before water can cover the slow-times . 
  nuclear ca n't do this , as you need days - if not week 's !,

  gdp used top mean something , then people realized how much emphasis is paid to it and they did everything they could to distort it and artificially inflate it ( think uk and italy now including * estimates * of drug and prostitution sales in gdp figures, 
  i find that the lines blur but there is a connnection , young libertarians generally turn into your typical conservative over time the same way young anarchists on the left turn more socialist over time, 
  pretty lame if you ask me . 
  and not even a moderator note as to why it was removed in the comments . 
  mods here have been doing a better job of informing people here as to why submissions are removed lately but then when they remove something without a good reason ( from my perspective ) they never state why . 
  [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/unitednationsofreddit/search?q=europe+or+%2fr%2feurope&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all ) is a good sub that shows everything that 's removed from this sub and the reason . 
  i still ca n't figure out why they removed that story about the old french guy pretending he was a stud online and then banging roleplay blindfolded ladies, 
  so this is the scale of `` le libertarian utopianess '' survey sponsored by the koch brothers pet project ... right gotcha , will start taking this seriously any day now, 
  give us liberland flair please for muh libertarn utopia plz . 
  * stop oppressing me with taxes \u2122 *, 
  lol those are good standards that i try to apply as well but for me it 's a constant trade off between letting the odd fatty through the qa process and keeping up my rpm ( ratings per minute ) i apply similar qa standards but then [ these ] ( http://data3.whicdn.com/images/61476380/thumb.jpg ) always slip through the cracks, 
  my account is n't old enough to meet the age requirements yet as i like to change account every so often so my posts are judged on their merit and not individual user bias or peoples cumulative res scores ( yes i 'm guilty of auto down-voting people who show up red due my track record of downvoting them so i asusme others are n't perfect too ) . 
  my point is how much emphasis is put on being a member long term of the community and how much is based on merit , for example if i use my older account which has n't been so active but does satisfy the  1 year requirement will the lack of recent post history count against me ? 
  i 'm definitely sending this article to all the hambeasts that posted misleading face only pictures on tinder just to later rape my inbox and lave me feeling ashamed in my lack of better fatdar . 
   juncker made it clear that a ` grexit ' was not an option , because it would be an existential threat to the 19-member economic and monetary union . 
  there we go greece and syriza wins , a great day for the european left i hope, 
   however you are certainly fooling yourself if you think immigrants sees studying with swedes as an opportunity to see `` how the normal swede acts and studies in school '' . 
  i see you have given up on intergeneration then i take it ? 
  was just thinking the same and then figured that guy is probably just cycling from one girlfriend to the next given the able bodied male/female ratio after the war . 
  i 'd be looking classy too if i was one of the few lucky sons of bitches to still be alive then . 
  some people probably think i 'm calling these europol guys corrupt too and this is such a pro euro sub and all . 
  of course they could be corrupt , or they could be corrupt romanian officers who took bribes , learned from the criminals and decided decided a straight job with europol is better than being a shitty corrupt with romanian police or they could be just good guys . 
  few people would argue romania is n't a hub of illegal online activity anyway . 
  i like this , the most important element is the choice . 
   the most important problem people bring up is the tyranny of the majority . 
  while i think that it 's a real problem , its importance is overstated . 
  it 's nothing a good constitution and judicial system ca n't solve . 
  optional vote delegation would solve much of it as well . 
  generally stupid people are n't the biggest voters anyway and letting people who are n't interested in politics delegate their vote to someone else would clean that up a bit . 
   no , i 'm against stupid masses reducing my rights . 
  ah the old reddit superiority complex showing itself again . 
  while it might not be directly related switzerland is also the world 's happiest county and it 's kinda well known having control over ones life is an important element of happiness . 
  anyway are n't you some sort of `` libertarian '' ? 
  i thought that 's all about direct democracy . 
  well it makes sense , a lot of carding , identity theft and other illegal online activity comes from romania . 
  ironically one reason i heard it was so big there was becasue of police non enforcement . 
  well with an attitude like that how could it not, 
  `` but , but we need more immigrants as we do n't have enough children to fill future jobs . '', 
  imo the youth unemployment problem is one of the most shameless products of society right now . 
  large corporations ... sure , regarding institutions i see no reason why they need such huge focus on branding . 
  being efficient at what they do is their role . 
  thing is pr and advertising houses are more like the high end prostitution industry than say the law profession . 
  governments and bureaucrats think with the `` more expensive must be better '' mindset but in reality they are only paying extra for the allusion of grandeur , intelligence , exclusivity and all that but in reality the same pr houses are serving 20 clients a day the same shtick . 
  there is a case for spending huge money on branding ( say for emotional products ) but for an institution like the eu who has a robust institutional image there is little a creative can do but work within a very limited framework . 
  the fact the new logo is barely any different to the old one is testament to this . 
  well i have the op tagged as a corporate sympathizer and propaganda producing libertard so theres that . 
  as per the rules of the sub i 've retorted it for not providing proper sources for their nice clip art they stole form google images are are trying to pain protesters with . 
  just report it and move on . 
   that literally has nothing to do with the european union but with the contractors . 
  it has everything to do with the eu and lack of common sense and oversight regarding who and how it 's funds are distributed . 
  it 's just the common problem of `` not my money '' and resulting laziness about maintaining proper checks and balances . 
   anyway it 's pretty clear nothing can convince you otherwise so this discussion is pointless anyway . 
  i 'm all for convincing but i 'd like it to be evidence based , the best way the eu can do that is to clean up it 's act and think about the consequences of it 's actions . 
  even the simple think of not thinking about how 50 % grants for construction projects would push up prices . 
   money allocation schemes , mostly for the more developed countries such as building walking paths across the uk or restoring small ports in italy and look what happens ... http://www.theunituk.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=5017:500k-footpath-cash-at-centre-of-anti-fraud-investigation-by-eu&amp;catid=12:unattributed&amp;itemid=6 same problem exists and i remember this first hand where my uncle who is a farmer was telling me how he is getting 50 % funding from an eu fund to build a new type of shed for his animals , this was only available for a certain time and i believe lots of farmers were also applying for the grant to do the same works , guess what happens . 
  local contractors are suddenly so busy becasue of the increased number of building starts due to this grant funding they * have no choice * but to charge double the price ( becasue they are in such high demand ) that in the end the actual cost ( to the farmer ) was pretty much the same as what it is today in the depressed construction environment . 
  if you ask me at this stage most people have first hand experience of how the eu is run as a bit of a joke and the accountability that would exist if politics and power was more local is not there . 
   i highly doubt they know or care that eu companies have more isds disputes than us ones , its the same hatred you see every year with a tinge of extreme left and anti-americanism/corporations . 
  why would i differentiate between getting raped in the ass by an american or european criminal . 
  i 'm still getting the d against my will am i not ? 
  ive read most of what my privilege allows me ( what was leaked unofficially and the cute dumbed down information texts ) and \u00edt seems like with most legal texts much is about interpretation but based on my understanding , the interpretation of others and the historical results trade deals of the past have produced i see no reason to think anything good can come to the average citizen from this . 
  depends on the industry , i 've applied for funding for startups and it was very tight and competitive however move to regional infrastructure where bids are put in by the few monopoly construction firms in the area who know if they do n't out-compete each other everyone wins then it 's often a different story . 
  ghost airport springs to mind http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/12/14/us-poland-airports-specialreport-iduskbn0js06k20141214, 
  it must have been really bad there then as the overspends and bad procurement were what i seen on local projects . 
  wow , they are urging now ... that 's only one step away from pleading and two from resigned . 
  we can do it reddit . 
  it will be our own eu sopa/pipa victory, 
  based on my own third hand experience where eu money is handles by local politicians as license to help their friends contractors get a job they can overcharge for in the hope of getting a kickback one day it 's unfortunately all too common and that 's the problem with big bureaucracy , nobody cares as it 's not * their * money, 
  entirely ridiculous but unfortunately not unheard of either, 
  this is not one of those articles you really need to ~ ~ read ~ ~ view before commenting . 
  a self made it millionaire but yea his qualifications are agreed unknown . 
  still at this point i think finland could use a ceo and not a career politician, 
  and this is why i hate large bureaucracy , nobody gives a shit how much eu money is wasted . 
  then they say the eu was n't to support tech startups but yet they demonstrate they have no idea what they are doing or demonstrate any knowledge as i could get them a better service and all round re-branding with a choice of 50 logo designs and a three stage consultation process for $ 800 . 
  and they wonder why euroskeptics like me exist, 
  nah dude , you do n't see sipil\u00e4 taking a picture of every turd that pops out of his asshole for twitter . 
  i 'm well aware of the stubs affiliation , i just hate the guy so much i will continue to be childish and spell his name wrong accidentally on purpose . 
  was n't there polls a while back that show people think of him as the most insincere i think , the guy always strikes me to have a plastic say one thing but do another look to him and that 's basically it . 
  so in other words the eu can reject it later and break obama 's legacy piece . 
  nice, 
  as opposed to insecure swedish speaking swedes who elect people to just protect their language . 
  sorry but you only have to look at stub to smell the sense of self entitlement off of him . 
   the actual text of the agreement will be public for more than a year before its ratified [ 1 ] i thought this was obama 's `` thing '' he was n't to be known for . 
  if they are to be public for a year after they are eventually released am i not right to assume he has no hope in getting that thing passed before he 's out of office ? 
  not sure if joking and that 's the sad thing ? 
  i 'm seriously wondering how much thing thing cost considering i have a bunch of freelancers churning out better samples for less than 1/1000th of the price right now, 
   how should i know ? 
  you tell me . 
  well in short they do n't support any of the liberal policy 's i mentioned  that 's why you are fierce supporter of russia and putin ? 
  haha . 
  whats with that bs ? 
  where have i ever expressed any such support or care to source me on that . 
  i am however opposed to hurting our own trade with russia in order to help the usa and the eu out in their geopolitical games . ', 
   and what 's your stance on economic issues ? 
  cause what you described now is applicable to socialdemocrats too . 
  economically i 'm against globalization which on a macro scale i see as a sellout of private national industry to multinational corporations which to me limits national sovereignty and puts me more on the left sphere however i have been ant bailout since the very beginning where iceland took a different path on the crisis than the eu . 
  i 'm firmly in the varoufakis camp that bailouts are only a means of prolonging the core problem with would be better dealt with by a debt jubilee allowing nations to grow again . 
  i do n't have any major problem with the election results in finland although they are way to socially conservative for my liking . 
  that said i did n't vote for either and gave it to the pirateparty since there was really no mainstream party that is n't tainted in some way imo . 
  well i would call myself liberal , seeing as i support the right of sexual minority 's to marry and adopt , i am against drug and alcohol prohibitions favoring the `` drug use is a social and not criminal matter '' argument .

  the catalan one wo n't be because it is not supported by madrid . 
  well they had to act now because of the negotiations for new government . 
  these were the more popular mps in the party . 
  most of them will maybe lose their seats in the next election but overall i think most of them were going to lose them anyways if election was called now . 
  while immigration issues boosted the finns party popularity it was traditionally not a single issue movement . 
  if they put up a new party they might be able to get some of the old support for the finns party . 
  there are volunteer `` patrols '' that check as many new edits as they have time to but there is no quality control before publishing . 
  you can go to a page and edit it to say that every balkan politician is a fucking gay squirrel and that would go live immediately . 
  silly things go trough all the time but usually someone corrects the bad parts quickly . 
  there are some articles that show clear political bias and those are sometimes marked with a warning box on top of the page . 
  also pages that are constantly vandalised can be put under special protection that temporarily prevents open editing . 
  the difference is that unlike trump he is actually intelligent . 
  his followers are not but he himself is . 
  almost everything he says publicly is calculated to have some effect on the public . 
  he is wrong on the part where he thinks it 's because of some racial characteristics . 
  if someone wonders what that `` maakuntahallitusmuutos '' thingy is , it 's basically a gerrymandering effort to fortify the centre party power in the provinces . 
  like i said the entire finns party is anti immigration and has been during this government term . 
  the other parties in the government are not that strictly anti immigration but certainly do not have very favourable view on it either . 
  the immigration policy in finland is really not that open you would get from the right wing narrative . 
  for example people from souther iraq do not get asylum in general unless they can prove some kind of personal danger . 
  we are basically sending back people who ran after losing their family in war . 
  also currently people from northern iraq get sent back because the immigration office thinks they can settle to southern iraq . 
  we got a large number of asylum seekers during the past couple of years but not that many of them got to stay and many of those who got to stay got a temporary asylum . 
  the problem is that halla-aho is a clear racist by the real definition of that word . 
  he thinks the african people have inherent negative traits that cause the society to deteriorate if too many africans are present . 
  he also speaks favourably about authoritarian ideas . 
  on the other hand it is sort of an ideal government party . 
  they increase the power of government on the condition that the swedish language status is not diminished which is usually an easy thing to agree for other parties . 
  and several good ministers have come from the swedish party . 
  so i personally have no problem with them . 
  we have no leftist party in this government . 
  and no , the problem with halla-aho is not that he is anti immigration . 
  the entire finns parti is very much anti immigration . 
  i should add that `` known supporter of more strict refugee laws '' is a bit of an understatement . 
  the guy thinks societal problems are an inherent property of people of african origin and has expressed favourable views on military authoritarianism . 
  also the deputy chairpersons they chose include a woman who thinks evolution is impossible ( which in finnish context means she is a complete religious nutjob ) and a man who is basically a stereotypical finnish drunkard spending time with criminal gangs and forgetting his work papers in their clubhouse . 
  since the finns party got a very large share of votes in the previous elections they wanted to add them to the government . 
  not least because they had benefitted from the opposition role quite a lot during the economic crisis . 
  and the other parties were not needed for majority . 
  the party cohesion has been high on most questions . 
  so in almost every case it is enough that they have one more representative present in each vote . 
  essentially very similar reason why the popular vote distribution does not necessarily decide the representative distribution in the us elections . 
  each constituency ( around 100000 voters each i believe ) votes separately and the winner takes it all . 
  so it 's enough the get simple majority in each to get 100 % of the seats . 
  they have a two round system where there can be multiple candidates on both rounds so you do not necessarily need even 50 % of the votes to win in a constituency . 
  you just need more votes than the others got . 
  they get trough it . 
  the most annoying part is that they can bite trough socks . 
  so your ankles are almost always unprotected even though it feels like they are covered . 
  ok , even more annoying is the small parts of your skin that are not so sensitive , like your knuckles . 
  the mosquitoes swarm there without you noticing and you will have a dozen mosquito bites in each finger . 
  the suffocation because of mosquitoes gives much more interesting mental image . 
  with that amount of children it 's really hard for them to go extinct . 
  funnily if i calculated correctly , the 650kg is about the amount we need in a year to sustain a meg machine in our uni . 
  that shit costs something like 50k $ . 
  i think they get small amounts of helium as a byproduct of natural gas production or something . 
  and thats pretty much it . 
  there should be bigger warning . 
  can not unsee . 
  so your basic argument is that any atrocity is justified because someone else has also committed that atrocity in the past ? 
  really brilliant , good job . 
  i have absolutely no problem with someone not speaking finnish and living in finland permanently . 
  but also they have no right to demand any service with any other language than the official ones . 
  oh they already did ? 
  got ta love the reliability of response . 
  like a clockwork . 
  well yeah i sort of take it as granted that the troops have to leave for any kind of solution to be possible . 
  an eagle attacking some kind of a caveman ? 
  i do n't think any resolution where the illegal settlers get to stay is very likely . 
  which is a bit of a problem since many of them have already been there for decades . 
  maybe some solution where they do n't get citizenship of the unified island but some kind of long term visa ? 
  i do n't think there is much chance for compensation of lost property though . 
  does anyone in north cyprus whose parents were citizens of cyprus before the invasion already qualify for citizenship in republic of cyprus ? 
  and suddenly there will be health security problems in montenegrin agricultural products . 
  also montenegro suddendly becomes an unsafe tourist destination . 
  must protect russian consumers . 
  finnish politicians seem to think exactly the same . 
  not really interested in joining except if sweden does . 
  so it seems you will have to take the initiative . 
  this has nothing to do with what genes you have . 
  the money is lost anyways . 
  military cooperation in eu does not really exist yet , everything is done in the nato framework . 
  and uk is by no means essential . 
  the significance of the intelligence i can not estimate but i 'm fairly sure we can do without . 
  sure . 
  they control slightly less than their population share suggests but that is still a lot . 
  what exactly does eu stand to lose ? 
  eu citizens have to move home ? 
  big deal . 
  some negative effects on trade ? 
  yes , but only a fraction of what uk faces . 
  you mean uk newspapers pull all kinds of unreasonableness out of their ass ? 
  eu has made no demands of any kind yet . 
  however the bulk of the financial times estimate is completely reasonable . 
  and i really do n't think uk has any serious leverage in the negotiations . 
  so germans will be exactly as fucking reasonable as they please . 
  even lichtenstein is relevant for someone . 
  the context in that discussion was a bit different . 
  anyways the point here was just that r/russia mod banned me for saying that outside r/russia . 
  they obviously need the plant to provide power for the metro .

  that 's really clever . 
  are these common in sweden ? 
  thanks , had n't seen that one . 
  explains gandhi 's butthurtness . 
  real gandhi would now be spinning in his grave ... because he liked to spin when he was alive . 
  then , of course , he was cremated . 
  so no grave spinning . 
  that sounded familiar ... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjloxbrntz4&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=10m55s, 
  ha , very true !, 
  i personally did n't like it at all . 
  i only saw it halfway because the light show caused a grand mal seizure . 
  woke up on a floor couple of hours later . 
  still flashing . 
  ( hear , hear ) . 
  maybe your `` song '' should have had more tits ? 
  and dildo foam churning . 
  next time lets see some live copulation . 
  that was a fucking disgrace . 
   personally , i think this is the funniest thing i 've ever witnessed , and being an austrian makes it even funnier to me , because i know the debate that has gone for weeks here . 
  i think i know how you feel , as a finn after lordi 's win . 
  the difference here is that conchita was a solo artist , had much less make-up and could actually fucking sing . 
  she was fabulous . 
  * the little book of calm * is better . 
   there was a study made that people in finland with a licence to carry are significantly less likely to be involved in a violent crime or any criminal act than people without one . 
  just to clarify , actual * carry * permits ( outside the law enforcement ) are incredibly rare in finland , the gun permits here are acquisition licenses ( a separate license for each individual firearm ) . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gun_politics_in_finland also , i 'd be interested to see a source for that study . 
  great stuff !, 
  looks like a good comedy series . 
  ( do n't forget to click the english captions on ), 
  oh you americans and your at least 557 varieties of guns . 
  oh man , this is indeed terrible . 
  sorry to hear this . 
  finland just replaced the television licence with a direct unconditional income tax , * yle-vero * , which is 50-140 $ depending on income . 
  the proceeds are used for funding the public broadcaster * yleisradio * . 
   it 's photoshopped to show her face more clearly ( and add ugly make up ) and make the colors pop a bit more . 
  it 's photoshopped to make her face clearly more ugly . 
  i think they were going for a cartoon witch look . 
  i 'm well aware of that . 
  i was talking about the hitler ballot : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/german_election_and_referendum,_1938 my point was to make a humorous comparison of the similar layout ( or gui ) where one choice is clearly a better choice . 
  i 'm not trying to imply : `` britain literally ~ ~ hitler ~ ~ third reich '' , but i just find that ballot really ridiculous . 
  saying `` yes '' is made easier in both cases . 
  `` poor lawrence '' ... 
  the man is clearly a firebug . 
  ah , i 've always thought we were called * reindeer * ( `` poro '' in finnish ) . 
  ( reindeer is apparently * p\u00f5hjap\u00f5der * in estonian . ), 
  i guess it 's the russians that call us `` poro '' ( reindeer ) . 
  yeah , sorry about the perpetually drunken herds of moose hoofing on the time-honored , cobblestone streets of your august capital . 
  i 've actually visited tallinn sober a few times . 
  well , almost sober . 
  ok , i was able to walk back to the boat without help . 
  now when i think about it , moose do n't form herds like reindeer do ... 
  i 'd like to hear some estonian jokes about finland . 
  ** edit ** : thanks for all the jokes . 
  very depressive . 
  good stuff , that gammel dansk . 
  yea , and they also enable you to enjoy the shit stench during and after the defecation . 
  oh , their fucking * sitzpinkel * movement . 
  that probably started because many of their toilets have those dry shelves to hold your shei\u00dfe after the dump . 
  so you can evaluate and enjoy it afterwards , i guess . 
  no wonder this perverted design causes some splashing when urinating standing up . 
  yes , that was a awkward moment for qi . 
  they used an urban myth as a fact . 
  i personally can see the basic income a very good idea , depending on how it would be implemented . 
  here in finland the basic income has received some positive reactions from the left and the right alike . 
  here 's some thoughts : the people living on ( social - , unemployment ) benefits would have * more * incentive to take short , or part-time jobs without the fear of losing the basic income . 
  the current system does n't encourage this at all . 
  you can earn up to 300 $ without losing your benefits , and this requires a lot of paperwork . 
  entrepreneurship would be boosted . 
  the current system basically can disqualify you from any benefits for a year or two if your small business fails . 
  this can raise the risk of starting your own business . 
  the system is also seen as a good way to reduce the absurd ( and costly ) bureaucracy people face when applying for benefits - especially the old people and people with mental health problems are often affected . 
  i understand most of the social workers here are now just handling need-based benefit applications . 
  arguably , some version of an unified basic income could be actually cheaper for the society . 
  this data was collated by ef language school :  the ef english proficiency index calculates a country 's average adult english skill level using data from two different ef english tests completed by hundreds of thousands of adults every year . 
  one test is open to any internet user for free . 
  the second is an online placement test used by ef during the enrollment process before students start an english course . 
  both include grammar , vocabulary , reading , and listening sections . 
   the open online test is a 30-question adaptive exam , so each test-taker 's questions are adjusted in difficulty according to his or her previous correct and incorrect answers . 
  the non-adaptive test is 70 questions in length . 
  all scores have been validated against ef 's course levels . 
  the test administration is identical for both tests , with test takers completing the exam on computers .

  smokers ( and fat people ) are actually cheaper to the society than `` healthy '' people : http://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/05/health/05iht-obese.1.9748884.html study : http://www.plosmedicine.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pmed.0050029 as you see , this does n't even include the huge tobacco tax income the governments receive . 
  this may sound odd , but apparently smokers ( and fat people ) are actually cheaper to the society than `` healthy '' people : http://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/05/health/05iht-obese.1.9748884.html study : http://www.plosmedicine.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pmed.0050029 as you see , this does n't even include the huge tobacco tax income the governments receive .

  then again , the ediplomat has apparently for more business oriented advice than the one op linked .

  how norway being in would fix it ? 
  the countries do not believe they are some `` great nation '' of the world and goal for most countries is not to become that either . 
  i know it is not due to its pretty look . 
  but the result still is that a horrible looking building in the middle of the city is there to stay . 
  i would imagine a more remote building could have been protected for similar reasons . 
  the worst is that the later building is protected now because the `` sausage '' feature despite it being the most hated building according to most polls . 
  all the soldiers where form the rich leisure class so it 's not like they just trained all their lives . 
  asia is so broad it is n't exactly a race . 
  not all muslims wear veils or are strict ( like half of my family who are tatars ) so this kind of broad question is hard to answer . 
  well here is the study but it 's in finnish http://www.finlandsinstitutet.se/fi/files/2017/02/novus-rapport-bilden-av-finland_del2_fi.pdf it did has some graphs and maybe you can find a swedish version somewhere , i did try but maybe i did n't use right keywords . 
  there a plenty of chinese everywhere because there are so many chinese total . 
  there is n't exactly a ton of important historical sites here in finland but there a still ton of them . 
  if finland still had karelia and the other arm in lapland it would look like a maiden . 
  one of the biggest reasons the loss was such a tragedy . 
  well often power in unions is decided by population such as parliamentary seats but iceland would not agree and the rest would probably support this to stop sweden form becoming most powerful country . 
  so sweden would have to be agree with a model where all countries get about equal power and would they ? 
  maybe but it 's one issue . 
  well not usually but when you see raikkonen used so much on f1 it almost seems odd to see the right version . 
  well maybe the poster says he is macedonian and does not count and that is something i do n't want to even comment . 
  but i would still say picking ancient greeks and saying they are greek is a bit odd since it 's such a huge time and culture change . 
  for example italians did not pick any romans ( nor did greeks any of the romans from greece , is that identity so strong in people 's minds they are just romans ? 
  if it had plato could have been on this list twice . 
  elves do n't need to be blond . 
  elves do n't need to be blond . 
  now i am not surprised greece gave full points to lordi in eurovision . 
  there is plenty of good metal gospel bands in finland too . 
  i think your knowledge of swans is limited as well if you think they support a man . 
  there are ( or were at this point really ) some people who liked lenin and his role in finland becoming independent but it was never mainstream . 
  but i would not say he was hated either . 
  lactose free milk is popular here so that is one reason milk is drank so muvh here . 
  i think the stereotype is that you drink you coffee black but all my friends ( and me ) drink with milk and sugar and they are offered everywhere . 
  so while drinking black might be still more common people putting milk into coffee ca n't be that small amount of population . 
  i do n't know , not a lot of people live in most green areas . 
  i did n't know it is drank elsewhere . 
  i kind if want to try now . 
  https://www.google.fi/amp/www.independent.co.uk/news/science/theres-nothing-wrong-with-cousins-getting-married-scientists-say-1210072.html%3famp  the risk of giving birth to babies with genetic defects as a result of marriages between first cousins is no greater than that run by women over 40 who become pregnant , according to two scientists who call for the taboo on first-cousin families to be lifted . 
  so this is maybe not answers why but a lot of people seemed to doupt that poster you responded to . 
  i am finnish and i agree they are ugly . 
  some people went overboard with simplicity and modern style trends and i guess they wanted to save money too ? 
  well those 15th century ones are so beautiful . 
  here in finland most new churches ( built in 20th and 21st century ) are really ugly and we do n't have a ton of old ones let since they were built mostly form wood like all buildings ( well churches actually were a bit more likely to be built on stone ) . 
  there was a post on ugly churches on finland once here if you want to look and then you might see that old style ones are better . 
  the one picture in this post is actually pretty nice for a 20th century church . 
  but i would imagine there would be ways to combine old with new that looks good and is functional .

  she is obviously big but i think it 's unfortunate for her that she has such a large face . 
  her body is n't that unsual ( even though it would still get comments as a health minister ) but her face is n't that common . 
  the point is that it still is bad enough that he does not qualify as a hero in my book no matter how nessecary ( but that is a bit depatable but imo irrelevant here since it would be stilll bad enough ) . 
  like i said hero would be a very exlucive club , it 's dangerous if to if people get called one merely by their virtues with their vices not looked into properly . 
  but like i said you can have a differing opinion if you please but i have never heard anyone consider him a hero before . 
  protecting language is not shittty kind of nationalism . 
  it 's good thing that people can communicate with english or other major languages but having different kind of native languages is a cultural richness that is n't harmfull if you can speak other languages . 
  you need to lack significant flaws like to be a hero like his participation to the terror was . 
  it does not matter what his accomplishments were if the vices are too much . 
  you can personally like him or say the good outweigh the bad but hero should be a very exlucive club . 
  i still would say `` heroes of europe '' should have a higher standard . 
  he can be mediocre as an agent but better at some other things . 
  if you have no clue of music is n't it better know at least something of him ? 
  and i do n't recall him being potrayed as a loser , he seemed succefull in the film , it 's his resentment of mozart that it 's really the issue . 
  she is still a first woman leading the country which is impoaybrt regardless of how many there presidents there has been . 
  and having an description in the title is n't some award so what does it matter if it 's mentioned or not ? 
  it 's still interesting thing to know about a person . 
  well we barely lost to swedes of all people . 
  the studies show that the high sentinces with the inability to join society drives crimes up . 
  but oviously us has other issues that drive the numbers up like the guns being so easily available and poverty in certain places that drives people to crime . 
  the name of colosseum comes form nero 's statue since the statue was near it . 
   he is perhaps best known for his role in the french revolution 's reign of terror . 
  sometimes people do things that are incredibly cruel despite them not even making sense . 
  there must have some some short term be benefit sure , if the production just collapsed they would have noticed . 
  but they could have just believed this would work without real evindence but just thinking it should work . 
  you clearly have not red the bible . 
  they did start to die much before warm weather issues . 
  they started dying because of fishing nets , mercury in the water and hunting . 
  now their numbers actually have risen form 100 to 320 . 
  i think there they should be in between normal office look and the fancy palace look . 
  they are important national institutions so a little culture and identity is good but if you overdo it is distracting and gives the members too much delusions of grandeur . 
  so did the women have to wear ties or was that a men only rule ? 
  it 's a bit off how the chairs look like couches but kind of nice too . 
  well they do have a great legacy but if you read the ancient text they assumed their culture would stay the same for thousands of years in the future . 
  in general ancient cultures were not able to predict process much since it was so slow it was impossible to see within few generations . 
  so only major process they would discuss would be negative with countries falling and stuff and they believed their own superiority so thought it would not happen . 
  its sad you got downvoted . 
  the stars should be the same size and at the same spot . 
  and that huge uk flag ...

  toga was what romans wore . 
  the similar greek garment was called himation , its more simple garment that toga which evolved form himation . 
  yes but the point was about presedents who are elected personally like in france . 
  parliamentary system is differerent . 
  presidents do n't nessecarily care for their parties . 
  they are n't even supposed to here in finland ( but they do n't have power much anymore but this was the case even before ) . 
  if politician ca n't be re-elected they practically do n't have to answer to the democratic system since i democratic systems it 's designed that the politicians remain midnfull of the voters to survive the next election . 
  of course this happens already if some president is elected to a second term when that is the term limit but it is thought that you have performed well in first term to get re-elected . 
  for eu if you get too favorable leave terms and others think they can follow . 
  or finland and norway combined of finland and denmark combined .

   you accept having to do hard work because you 're a man , but for women , it 'd be `` a punishment '' . 
  just because i have to do something , does n't mean it makes sense to force others to do it because it 's `` fair '' . 
  when i had to mow the lawn as a kid , i did n't ask that my brother would have to do it too because the lawn only needs to be mowed once . 
  more importantly , i said in the first place that i 'm not opposed to women having to do something like military service - because i 'm not . 
  i just do n't really care if they do . 
  stop being so butthurt . 
   more like when it 's comfortable for women let me get this right , you 're implying i think women 's issues are more important than men 's issues ? 
  you would be wrong . 
  i care even less about those , unless it 's something that actually matters . 
   discrimination applies all the time , the importance of a military only in selected few times the military does n't just stop existing between wars . 
  it 's there primarily as a deterrent . 
  there are few things more important and i think it 's absolutely laughable anyone would consider `` gender issues '' to be up there . 
   you mention `` civil service '' , which i can tell you , no , i do n't support giving women an extra option in every obligation just because they 're women men can also opt to do civil service instead of military service already . 
  my suggestion was simply that women would choose civil service primarily , where as about 10 % of men currently choose it . 
   having been in the military myself i can assure you that there are several women that were absolutely fit for the military and that the training itself was n't too hard for most men and that it would n't be too hard for the fit modern woman . 
  you did not say anything i did n't already say myself . 
   maybe you should n't have misinterpreted my comment in the first place if you did n't want to get a downvote . 
  read the community rules and guidelines , then . 
  the vote button is not for likes/dislikes , it is for trolls . 
   equality is more important than national defence . 
  quote of the year . 
   all equality would do for finland is having more soldiers ready in case big bear attacks . 
  we do n't really need more soldiers than we have with the current model , we need combat infrastructure and support roles . 
  we need people doing the jobs that are left behind . 
  we already have one of the largest armies in europe in sheer manpower , when we include the reserve . 
  you may argue women could be trained for such things during peace time , with the option of doing military training instead . 
  i would n't disagree . 
  for me this is really a non-issue . 
   obviously , you do n't care about equality but i do , when it matters . 
  i do n't believe in punishing people for punshment 's sake . 
  there has to be a purpose to it . 
  `` we have to do it too '' is not sufficient to me . 
  and , as i already said a dozen times , i 'm absolutely not opposed to women having to do a similar form of service , such as civil service . 
  i just do n't think it 's a major issue worth crying over . 
   some people with a victim mentality think it 's ok how they 're mistreated . 
  as i have already explained , i feel rather indifferent about it . 
  you seem to be the one with the victim mentality , even though you 're not a finnish male and i am . 
  we all have our duties . 
  having been through the military i can tell you with first hand experience that it 's too much for the majority of women . 
  it 's too much for a good portion of men too . 
  that is the physical reality . 
  if you ca n't do the bare minimum physically , you 're a liability in that world . 
  and as i already said , there are women who can and do fulfill those physical requirements , but they 're few and far between and i 'm not sure screening all women for the few gems is worth it . 
  they 're already struggling to come up with things to do for the men that are n't strong enough for combat roles . 
  i would also like to add , the voting system is not intended to be used as a ` like ' button for comments you agree or disagree with . 
  we do not have enough people for a volunteer army , i think we can all agree on that and it 's the basis of the entire discussion we 're having . 
  of course i would be all for abolishing conscription if we did n't need it . 
  when i said it 's necessary , i meant it 's * necessary * . 
  we are a country of 5 million and our border with russia is longer than the rest of the eu 's combined . 
  we need a strong defence and we simply do n't have the manpower without conscription . 
  keep in mind also that you * are * allowed to do civil service instead of military here . 
  i 'm sorry , but that is just not true . 
  there are non-combat roles where physical strength is n't needed , but they 're a minority and do not by and large require military training . 
  for 95 % of infantry positions , physical strength and resilience is one of the most important traits . 
  your gear is very heavy , you have long marches and might not get to sleep for several days in a row . 
  there are women who can put up with that for sure , but are here enough that mass conscription of women is worth it ? 
  they already have the option to join voluntarily . 
   you think that egalitarians want to make `` women 's lives worse '' - which , haha , sorry but indirectly admits to conscription actually making men 's lives worse yes , i outright said that . 
  conscription makes men 's lives worse . 
  making women go through it does not improve men 's lives though . 
  that was my point . 
   you 're willfully ignorant of , get that , your own sex ' discrimination ignorant , no . 
  indifferent , yes . 
   biology is imparted but discrimination is chosen sometimes it 's necessary , like in this case . 
  it 's necessary for us to have a strong national defence . 
  it 's necessary , then , for men to be conscripted . 
  is it necessary for women ? 
  i do n't think so . 
  i 'm not opposed to it , but i do n't particularly care about it or think it 's going to solve anything . 
  what you 're essentially talking about here is `` make women go through it too so it 's fair ! '', 
  when it does n't necessarily make any practical sense . 
  when talking about national defence , practical sense should be the only one that matters . 
  if you want , i can find you the link to a video ( in finnish ) of a prominent feminist politician in finland being asked about the conscription model ( her being a feminist and all ) saying she sees absolutely nothing wrong with the current model . 
  i think women that would make good soldiers already by and large volunteer for military service . 
  i 'm sure the government can figure out appropriate tasks for women in times of war . 
  some of them will be in the battlefield , as volunteering for military service is already allowed for women . 
  i must admit , gender issues are not very interesting to me and i do n't have a bone to pick with women for not having to go through what i have to go through in some aspects of life . 
  ultimately , i care about the defence of the country a lot more and if that imparts certain duties to me , so be it . 
  my life will not improve by making other people 's lives worse and the world is not always equal and fair . 
  tl ; dr i do n't really care, 
  a very complicated issue . 
  i guess the short answer would be , we are also worried about nato . 
  not to mention , it 's only longer than basic infantry service . 
  a lot of people end up doing the full year , not all of them voluntarily . 
  civil service is a much cushier deal , no contest . 
  nothing major . 
  there 's always talk , of all sorts of things . 
  but the situation does n't seem to be changing any time soon . 
  just so happens that the two sexes are not biologically identical . 
  it 's a fact that means there can not ever be true equality , physical realities simply get in the way . 
  i hated my time in the military but i also think it 's necessary . 
  we ca n't rely on outsiders to take care of us . 
  we ca n't rely on foreign military aid , history has taught us this much . 
  i 'm not as unnerved as i 'm amused . 
   and k\u00e4pyl\u00e4 is in fact rather sought-after neighbourhood to live in . 
  particularly `` puu - `` k\u00e4pyl\u00e4 is the best part of helsinki in my opinion . 
  it 's interesting because i 'm used to constantly getting jokes about alcoholism when people find out i 'm finnish . 
  a refreshing change . 
  who knows . 
  it was a mistake to join , but it 's of course easy to say in hindsight .

  to me it sounds like the best method of winning a united republic i 've ever heard of , either that or a sick tourism boost . 
  do n't expect logic and initiate from the irish leadership however , if anything they are the reactionary sort . 
   i think turkey is the only country in the world that still has a problem with it being called what it was . 
  do n't forget the usa in that , for some reason they think it was not a whole `` genocide '' dealy, 
  why would you think irish citizens do n't have unrestricted access to the uk and vice versa ? 
  i have no idea what you meant by that comment, 
   the northern europeans use ruthless business and political tactics toward others , but their secret is that they respect themselves and promote integrity at home this is more and more true i 'm afraid , and do n't forget the swedish refugee guilt that comes along with it . 
   your post sounds a bit `` anti intellectual '' . 
  i ca n't tell if that was intentional or not . 
  that 's funny as a scientist i prefer to use reddit in my fun time to discuss topics i 'm admittedly not expert in but that 's the fun of it . 
  your friend on the other hand seems to be all work and no play . 
  damm you make me think the place is some sort of nightmare waiting to happen now . 
  i kind was hoping if they got the right sort of publicity they would get the right sort of people but unfortunately the libertarian idea of equality falls flat on it 's face from day one because as we all know individual power corrupts . 
  i would n't be so hard on saying it has no economy prospects , again if they got the right people who 's skills complement each other they could work a very viable community/digital and even tourist economy however if some self professed libertarians ca n't decide if they should tolerate gay people or not i do n't hold much hope . 
  i do n't buy too much into the libertarian idea either , in fact i 'm a vocal sceptic most the time , that said i guess i 'm also a scientist so i have no problem trying something out for the sake of an experiment . 
  if anything at least if it later broke down we would soon have examples of some `` no true libertarian '' arguments come about . 
  i will follow this with interest though , funniest thing is i think the one thing they read right now is some strong leadership , something most are no doubt opposed to, 
  thats a fair thing to say but at the end of the day reddit is a general discussion board not a soap box for my sourced pro ttip enlargements either . 
  if over half my comment history was pro russian arguments most here would have no problem calling me a rusian sockpuppet so why hold others to a different moral standard . 
  if you were a budding rocket scientist my advice to you to not worry about preaching the awesomeness of rocket science on reddit but go and discuss it in a circle of your own peers . 
  chances are it will be a lot more beneficial to your career and the science as well . 
  put simply there is a line between being really enthusiastic about something and outright trying to convert people at every opportunity . 
  it will be like venice but with more mosquito 's, 
   anyway , that 's not what discouraged me but the fact that these people had an agenda damm that 's a real shame , somehow when first read `` no communists '' i got the same feeling as well but still nothing to stop another group making a real counter-claim  i 'm sure reddit could muster up some [ sort of fedora clad medieval army to fight it out ] ( https://youtu.be/oggtiu2pjsm?t=25m14s ) but seriously when i think about it nothing about this makes sense . 
  to begin with in the beginning is this whole thing owned by the founder guy and everyone will just be the equivalent of serfs ? 
  how can they decide how , who or under what criteria land should be given to `` citizens '' ? 
  cool idea but if anything right now it has better potential to pan out a good long game donation scam than a real nation . 
  well that 's how paid shills are supposed to work , does anyone here really think thesis is just some guy writing an international relations thesis or whatever and just happens to have time to sway every argument on reddit that pops up regarding ttip ? 
  the amount of campaigning this guy does must take actual hours of his time every day and i refuse to believe someone who is so into free market capitalism as this guy would also be such a terrible capitalist and give away their time for free . 
   the ec released a bunch of documents informing about what 's going on why ca n't we/they/a third party audit the papers and give us all a summary . 
  given how trade deals of the past have not always had the advertised effect i do n't exactly trust the ec 's bullet points, 
   the czech republic already signed up to the euro . 
  now it 's only a question of when , not whether . 
  or they could jut decide the eu is a waste of time and quit, 
  is it illegal to make people aware of publicly available information ? 
  and no i 'm not worried if someone goes an tp 's ( or ** tt ** ip 's hue , hue huel ) her house and she gets upset over it . 
  this is what happens when you let srs types get too much say . 
  put some pressure on a politician `` literally isis '' meanwhile videos of ukrainian politicians been thrown in dumpsters is upvote worthy material because `` dem russians '', 
   1 ) they are forcing a sale not nationalization , that 's still the state inserting itself in the affairs of a private business for political reasons is it not ? 
  my point is i do n't want to see the power of the state when it comes to knowing what 's best for private business and commerce, 
  * ability to no longer nationalize oil fields under ownership of private foreign firms . 
  ##### # justttipthings, 
  what a ridiculously uneducated and ignorant comment . 
  i suppose you think qe policy 's are capitalist cheat codes . 
  well in that case they deserve the title of `` pussies '' overly pc pussies at that, 
  good old / r/europe down-voting inconvenient facts once more, 
  holy shit , that reads way too much like modern day libertarians and given the same circumstances 'll bet they would react in the same way . 
  `` this is my private property and it 's just natural that resources move to the more virtuous , typing and poor people need to work harder , now give me your land '', 
  interesting fact , when asked what other country he would live in if not finland , soini replied , ireland . 
  i read this in some `` weird facts '' page , the guy is also one of a minority of catholics in finland and travelled in ireland for a while so maybe that has something to do with it . 
  wtf germans , where were you ? 
  i keep reading germany is acting like israels puppet in europe these days , a european `` usa vote in the hole '' so to speak, 
  `` do n't rock the boat '' and caring for other peoples sensitivities over common sense seems to be the moto of the 21st century unfortunately . 
  what 's worse is people are afraid to engage with each other over any sensitive issue these days so in the end they just remain paralysed unable to act or form an opinion became of what someone else might think of them . 
  to me it 's ridiculous and embarrassing for any society to stick it ' fingers in it 's ears shouting `` la , la , la , ca n't hear you '', 
  here here, 
  thats a fair point , noise to signal ratio and all that, 
  well to me it reads like you are inventing reasons why keskusta * will * be bad while making excuses for why kokoomus * were * bad . 
  `` not their fault , damm parties they were teamed up with '', 
  oh please if you ca n't defend your own views with fact and reason wthout resorting to censprship there is probably somthing not quite right with your own idealogy . 
  usury tends to pay well, 
  tnx , ive had my own run it with some of the more facist mods so was curous to know what was up their arse this time, 
  damm son , can kiss that goodbye soon no doubt . 
  i have some figures that show if we all did n't discriminate between the days of the week our gdp would grow as everyone getting paid less actually means coorporate olligarchs make more money of us and that 's good overall / s, 
   regarding problems with moderation out of interest what drama did i miss in the latest chapter of the devidreiss tyranny ? 
  i 'm pretty sure power hungry and undemocratic mod 's like this one only do that so if it ever gets to / r/all they can accidently delete the submisson and resubmit it with a lower score gaming reddit for their respective agenda 's ( which always seem to be in a certain uscentric direction ), 
  do they pay time and half in your ttip shill pr dept sundays as well ? 
  oh wait why would they , standards are satan , got it . 
   you 're not here in the czech republic . 
  you do n't see it first hand . 
  as useless and invasive as facebook is it 's very good for keeping in touch with people in other countrys so yes i do see and hear first hand how opinions have changed over the last year or two . 
   every government does it . 
  is n't that the question though , `` who is their government ? '', 
  if the eu is the one their kids are being indoctinated by, 
  can you fix the xbox app as well , i think i 've managed to watch a via through it like never . 
   the pro-russian protestors oh please , this pisses me off about people here now . 
  the anarchists i know in czech republic have been protesting the us military machine for decades and now they are suddenly called `` pro russian '' by the media and useful idiots on the internet for no good reason . 
  you can be against the usa and russia you know . 
  i for one am happy my antifacist friends there made peaceful protest and hope they cont be bullied by the polarised masses that seem to have adopted a george bushesque `` either with us or against us '' line http://afed.cz/text/6062/anarchiste-proti-dragounum, 
  as a european i do n't really see the difference between neo conservationism and the koch brothers style of libertarian which to me boils down to `` remove all the regulations so i can make more money '' i recognize the differences you pointed out but in the end both are far right ideologys that seem to support a toxic brand of capitalism that advances the interests of big business, 
  i would think no less of a koch brothers sponsored neo conservative think thank to say protecting domestic food production is a bad thing . 
  but here 's the thing , farming in all developed countries needs help to compete with cheaper imports from developing nations otherwise what are you going to do , let the land go wild again and import the food from the third world ? 
  nothing is going to change that and it 's the price we pay for food security . 
  also farmers in the developing world might then get higher prices for their produce but ordinary citizens will also get higher prices . 
  then you have europe left in the precariously exposed geopolitical situation where it ca n't feed it 's citizens should others decide they do n't want to sell us food anymore . 
  would you really feel safe knowing all your food comes form thousands of kilometers away ? 
  in the end all the cock brothers as i call them would produce is less food in the world than there is already and more starvation if they got their way . 
  how do organisations like greenpeace , wwf , amnesty international live ? 
  funding and donations but in such a way that they do n't dictate their policy and agenda, 
  people like me do , politics should attract the same kid of people who are attracted to charity work , philanthropists who are interested in giving back to society and not power hungry people who want to better themselves . 
  politics would be better if all money was banned . 
  yes lower prices are bad if it 's at the expense of the producer who makes a tiny fraction of what the final product sells for . 
  you wont be once again when you figure out who all the faces are , 
  proper anarchist or libertard ? 
  in the system we do current live , quota 's do have their place in helping curb the destructive nature of capitalism however, 
  yea i 'm not laughing . 
  [ just makes me think of this ] ( https://bobbiblogger.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/trickle-down.jpg ), 
  quota 's and subsidy 's are not the same . 
  also loss leader selling and greater bargaining power by big supermarkets has made sure farmers barely get paid for their milk anyway . 
  all hail the glorious european factory farm as that is the only thing that will survive this and shittier animal welfare for all .

  that 's quite the username you have there . 
  and it actually affects them . 
  yeah , i 'd consider myself a federalist and i like eu and i think it 's a great achievement , but that in no way prevents me from loving finland and being very proud of our little nation . 
  united in diversity and all that . 
  i 'll tell you what . 
  you 'll set a price for them and we just pocket the money . 
  `` thanks for taking us in . 
  could you point us towards europe ? 
  '' ... '' `` this ... this is n't europe , r-right ? '', 
  `` uhhmmm ... '' `` oh god '', 
  you ca n't expect me to pay full price , these politicians are clearly faulty !, 
  how about this , you 'll sell them for me cheap and i 'll make it worth your while . 
  come on , let 's talk about this over an expensive dinner . 
  true or not , it does sound pretty bizarre . 
  it will be pretty ridiculous if they ban one without banning the other . 
  or do any kind of research , really . 
  but it 's rare to even read the article , so i doubt anyone is willing to do that . 
  i think it could be showing much muslims have been in the news and perhaps been overrepresented by them . 
  but without a some sort of test or control group it 's impossible to say . 
  you could do the same test for gays , another group that 's said to be overrepresented in the media . 
  my straw man disagrees . 
  could be that they 're all subscribed to / r/europe . 
  as a subscriber , i 'm fairly sure that muslims have overran finland and make up approx 2/3rds of our population . 
  allah bless your day , my brother . 
  it 's not based on reason . 
  * bbc : uk votes to have the cake and eat it too *, 
  not being factual has n't really stopped the propaganda . 
  no no , we 're different from those beast . 
  europe would never be like that . 
  they 're a bit loony , are n't they ? 
   or they can try to change things where they are , that 's democracy for you . 
  #  that 's not democracy though i 'd say you either worded that really poorly or you replied to the wrong comment chain if you 're not advocating for the minority to leave if they do n't like it . 
  if you read the full comment thread again , you 'll see why i thought that was your view of democracy . 
  same here . 
  but i think that 's because our school was heavily christian ( at least members , not necessary religious ) . 
  so it was n't an issue before there was more people from other faiths . 
  of course it 's a problem from the separation of church and state angle , but finnish schools and finnish state has some work to do there anyway . 
  agreed . 
  it would n't be a democracy as we have it without that , but some sort of tyranny of the majority . 
  so estonian opposition parties should just leave the country ? 
  it 's not a democracy if the minority ( / opposition ) is n't allowed to voice their opinion and try to change things . 
  being able to critique the majority and work to change things for yourself is kinda the thing about a functioning democracy . 
  besides , just because they 're not ethnic danes does n't mean they 're immigrants or foreigners . 
  it 's kinda odd of the guy above you to assume they 're all foreigners , since a lot of the kids were probably born in denmark to immigrant parents , which means they 're not immigrants or foreigners in any meaningful way . 
  i have a great plan for becoming the president of the united states . 
  i 'll say that god wanted me to run for president . 
  i 'm not religious at all , but i mean , * if * there are gods and i guess there could be , it 's not out of the realm of possibility that one of them thought `` this arttu fella ? 
  he should totally run for president '' . 
  so technically i 'm not lying . 
  i 'd probably be a terrible president , but all things considered , they could do a lot worse . 
  i was thinking of this cup in particular . 
  i 'm not saying they are definitely the worst offenders . 
  it 's just what i 've picked up from news . 
  so , if there 's bias somewhere , it 's there . 
  eh , i really doubt it . 
  well , yeah . 
  that 's the reason . 
  it 's generally not that necessary . 
  so , england , france , russia ? 
  those countries keep coming up in the news . 
  i wonder if there 's any other countries involved in hooliganism in a major way . 
   russia * on the brink of * annexing marseille ? 
  that 'll get everyone riled up and clicking and commenting like mad . 
  and those writing the articles could defend themselves by saying that it * could happen * . 
  western countries shift the blame towards east just like east shifts the blame towards west . 
  that 's just how it goes , i guess . 
  there 's been some major hooliganism from several nations , but the russians were probably the worst . 
  also one reason why they 're getting the focus in here i 'd say is because there 's some serious ( albeit somewhat justified ) hostility between russians and most of the user base . 
  not a huge amount to save up . 
  it 's really not very puzzling . 
  most people save up for occasions like this . 
  so , unless they 're dirt poor and forced to spend all they earn , it 's not very surprising . 
  i 'm not sure how that makes sense . 
  eu ca n't control its borders , but member states can ? 
  but it 's not the eu who is guarding the borders , it 's the member countries . 
  the eu does n't really have its `` own borders '' . 
  what eu can do is to give a list of people who should n't be allowed to enter and the members counties act on that . 
  so , very much like how it works in general . 
  russia is pretty firmly in europe . 
  there 's zero doubt about that . 
  there 's some room for discussion about turkey , but not for russia . 
  i think it should definitely be examined if this is grounds for banning of russia , but certainly not on the grounds of them `` not being european '' . 
  that would just be ridiculous . 
  huh ? 
  i can read that article just fine . 
  is there some localized block or is it read article count ? 
  i 'm not so sure about that , especially the gun ownership . 
  there was n't one solid `` monoculture '' in place before the immigration ( not counting native americans and even they were n't a single nation ) and stuff like that affected it . 
  but i 'm not saying it 's a solid model for europe or any other place than the us , i 'm just saying that multicultural societies are n't an impossibility . 
  eh , i 'm not so sure about that either . 
  i think it fits well in the progress of things , even if the uk referendum was n't going on . 
  things like this do n't happen very quickly and are usually implemented after `` softer '' measures have already proven ineffective . 
  so i think it fits well in that timeline . 
  but , i 'll give you that the * announcement * of this might be because of the referendum . 
  but i would n't put it solely on that either . 
  could be the natural progress of things , could be that the plan was already fairly ready and they decided that the announcement had the added benefit of pleasing populist anti-eu people in europe and in the uk in particular . 
  i * really * doubt that 's the sole reason . 
  whether uk stays or not , we still have this migrant crisis going on and have to deal with it somehow . 
  proposing stuff like this helps with the stay camp , but i doubt that 's their sole objective . 
  or even the focus here .

who cares ? 
  most of the muslims we have here in the west are muslim arabs . 
  that 's the image you 'd get if you only went to / r/europe . 
  in reality many finns do n't want estonian immigrants for multiple reasons . 
  lots of them in construction jobs , people feel they are taking their jobs . 
  many of them are thieves and ethnic russians . 
  some of them are taking benefits , working here , but still pay their taxes to estonia . 
  lower economic class ( poor , badly educated by finland 's standards ), 
  because russia is evil . . duh . 
  pizza with mustard is really good !, 
  i only use it with microwave pizzas tho . 
  please no . 
  but they are still estonians ? 
  most of them are most likely russian estonians , sadly due to your country having 25-30 % of them . 
  not saying everyone is , of course not , but a too high percentage . 
  the booze cruisers do n't live in estonia . 
  they spend a few hours/days in estonia , whereas the ones i mentioned live here . 
  i would , absolutely . 
  twin cities ? 
  really ? 
  would just bring more estonian thieves , hookers and cheap workers here tbh . 
  yes , we are ready for an attack at any minute now . 
  read again . 
  indo-european balto-slavic baltic eastern baltic lithuanian they have a common ancestor . 
  indo-european balto-slavic slavic, 
  wrong . 
  latvian and lithuanian are slavic languages . 
  source [ here ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lithuanian_language ) and [ here . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/latvian_language ) 2 . 
  latvian ethnic groups : 61.6 % latvians 25.8 % russians 3.4 % belarusians 2.3 % ukrainians 2.1 % poles 1.2 % lithuanians 4.8 % others / unspecified as you can see , latvians are only a slight majority in the country , where 30-40 % are ethnic slavs . 
  and in estonia : 68.8 % estonians 25.1 % russians 1.8 % ukrainians 0.9 % belarusians 2.4 % others about 25-30 % of estonians are ethnic russians/slavs . 
  3 . would n't say their culture is drastically different from other slavic countries . 
  we got 1 bronze medal ... 
  it does n't just sound like it , it means that . 
  yes , they want to let all possible refugees in . 
  a few members do n't make the whole party racist . . 
  are portuguese and spanish the same ? 
  or english and dutch ? 
  some would disagree sure , but it is simply a fact , a shared language group means little in the grand scheme of things . 
  and then they destroy the great internet deals we have now , thanks . . 
  yes i do . 
  just because we share a common language , does n't mean our cultures are the same . 
  take for example iran , just because the language is indo-european , does n't make them closer to swedes or germans than to other neighbouring countries . 
  estonia shares common history with other baltics , being under soviet occupation and all . . 
  there is no `` finnish cultural group '' . 
  finnish culture is finnish culture , but it 's certainly 10 times closer to the swedish one than the estonian one . 
  finno ugric is a language group . . does n't make the estonians any less baltic culturally . 
  and estonia just had to copy the finnish anthem . . 
  not just terrorists , they are pretty much non-existent here , but the arabs/muslims just do n't get jobs and commit a lot more crimes than others . 
  they do n't integrate well . 
  i do n't think this is something to be proud of . . unless you wanted to make a joke with the word `` pride '' . 
  hahahahaha . 
  in a population of 8 million . 
  what a joke . 
  the us should be getting 50 million refugees in your opinion then ? 
  italy and greece need to have better border control then . 
  not sure if joking , but the refugee amounts should be in few thousands , not even close to millions . 
  preferably no refugees , we owe them nothing . 
  the first one . . what a joke lol . 
  forest *, 
  they do n't work here , they beg for money . 
  should be `` my cousin is a beggar here '' . 
  and let me guess , it 's only men who have to serve . 
  if i was the us , i would n't want even more beggars to my country either . 
  good . 
  i live in the capital region as well . 
  i do n't honestly know which is used more as i have n't paid much attention to it , but `` yksinkertainen '' is quite a long word , which means people tend to use shorter variations a lot . 
  simppeli is imo more common , but it 's informal . 
  these are not just rumours , they are facts . 
  it 's in the eastern european culture to cheat whenever they can . 
  i find it hard to believe estonia is doing that well . 
  they are pretty poor , have a large russian minority and what i 've heard of their school culture is that it 's full of cheating . 
  georgia used to be a part of the soviet union ... 
  nope . 
  nobody is scared . 
  russia has no reason to attack us so we are n't really worried . 
  the countries russia has invaded have had large russian minorities or even majorities like in crimea . 
  here the minority is about 1 % . 
  agree , we should ally ourselves with russia , so we 'd have no one left to attack us !, 
  for some reason they claim to be neutral even though their flag has a plus on it . 
  if you consider russians and half russians to be better looking , maybe then . . 
  hahaha . 
  it 's obvious she was using , just like the other norwegian skiiers who suddenly rose to the top . 
  no it is not , it 's much further apart . 
  well . . they do need foreigners you know . . to avoid accidentally banging their cousins / s, 
  the only things estonia are known for here are thieves and cheap booze . 
  well . . for example some people do n't want gays to be able to opt for adoption , but might be okay with them being able to marry , therefore their answer would be negative to this question . 
  everyone together !, 
  do it for germany !, 
  germany stronk !, 
  actually it means `` pearl month '' . 
  think about it this way : it 's worse everywhere else . 
  cos we suck . 
  10 years ago we were on the same level as sweden , now 10k gdp per capita behind . . 
  we have sunk low . . 
  when did the americans save us ? 
  they just ruined our plans of greater-finland . 
  increased prices/removal of unlimited data . 
  terrible . 
  thanks eu once again . .

none hopefully, 
  am i the only who rode huge tomato, 
   no more trust for eu - deutsche welle * ( english.ruvr.ru ) *, 
  may be if i ignore things i do n't like they will dissapear, 
  buzzwords, 
  absolutely disgusting, 
  they lack of culture , or hate themselves . 
  this is why they make up and cherrypick their ancestry and heritage ( german-american , irish-american ... ) and try to imitate them . 
  why are there so many retards talking about culture or religion ? 
  the submitter is clear : multiethnic or multiracial . 
  it 's funny because english are barely germanic,

  how has this guy become a mod anyway ? 
  we are scanning the universe but we can not fix the economy think about it,

  fascinating, 
  g8 b8 m8 it will generate sum h8, 
  this video is gold, 
  then why are eastern europeans and southern europeans , who are as poor as other non-european immigrants , less likely to commit crimes ? 
  i do n't always defend the piiggs , but i also hate finland being seen as germoney 's lapdog along holland . 
  the truth is that piiggs are blaming germany 's government and elite , the imf ... while recent poll says that 60 % of the germans see the southeners as lazy and corrupt blaming their entire population . 
  in greece , people insult merkel , and the entire german population feels somehow insulted , and germans insult greeks and not the greek president , which they usually do n't even know the name . 
  ** average greek to a german ** : your government is not applying proper economic reforms . 
  ** average german to a greek ** : oh my god we already said we are sorry for killing 6 trillions and invading pooland why are you calling me a natsee stop living in the past and generalizing everyone is lazy except me you are 0:00 ' 5 seconds late because you are an underman and i love sausages, 
  americans already make the second biggest immigrant group in germany , the last thing we need are more fatsos in this continent . 
  who would know hat travelling would be replaced with a collection of photos of roofs in the xxi century,

  going through every street of every city takes its time . 
  briteeth pls, 
  people outside europe may not be aware of the current economic situation of each country . 
  it 's not about religion or lack of religion but the american culture that differs so much from the western culture . 
  here you are taugh to not give a fuck about other 's beliefs . 
  the person that wrote this is a racist . 
   being 9 and watching action films where dark men rape and kidnap , manipulate and lie , steal and abuse . 
  this is the proof , he would be happy if light men did this . 
  i hope that the submitter of this article gets banned . 
  pay your debts, 
  the british comedy that keeps on giving : in control of their own currency . 
  still manages to do even worse than the eurozone . 
  absolutely no industry , london is carrying on the whole country by being the second biggest money laundry country in the world ( stealing which is what great britain has done through all their history anyway ) . 
  they believe they are north europeans , and they compare themselves to germany or think their culture have anything to do with germany . 
  this subreddits just reflects how poor english vocabulary is , as most of these words can be easily said in finnish but not in english . 
  daily islamophobic thread . 
   [ i actually tagged you as `` anti-eu no argument '' because you keep posting crap like this when you clearly have no idea what you 're on about . ^ ] ( http://i.imgur.com/kchflam.png ), 
  are you angry about this ? 
  ok , but without sweden, 
  because i am not paying even more for your stupidity and incompetence , in exchange of having less freedom . 
  period . 
  you must be really retarded to think that spaniards , italians and greeks are richer than germans . 
  it 's actually called '' perkele '' around here . 
  there is a button for this . 
  why dont you limit yourself to mod with reddit website rule instead of banning people based on their opinions ? 
  not that it matter , retards would still downvote them instead of upvoting/downvoting based on the quality of the post . 
  he also was a mod of / r/canada but got dismissed . 
  indifference . 
  i ca n't , they are blind and blindly believe things that probably are not real just because they are in a book , probably to rip some money off them . 
  we need to buy them carl sagan books and take them to neil thyson meets up so they can know the only truth . 
  on one hand , i am a multicultural tolerant . 
  on the other hand , i am a militant proscience antitheist . 
  what do i do ? 
  dont even bother to reason with these people , they are the ahteist version of the westboro baptist church . 
  let 's hope they somehow win the elections and we can carry on freely with our countries and lives ; germany abandoning this sham is all we need . 
  what the fuck am i reading, 
  uk all day everyday . 
  when greece asks for a 5th bailout and italy and spain go bankrupt , she 's going down . 
  finnish education focuses on educating people so everyone can do their best . 
  in other countries , education seems to be some sort of competition , which only proves that you are good at studying , not at the job you are looking for and that may not reflect the reality . 
  my country 's education system is without questions the best of the world . 
  pros : it is the best of the world cons : you need to live relatively near to sweden, 
  what does this have to do with homosexuality , multiculturalism and blaming germany for everything ? 
  do you know what subreddit is this ? 
  hookers & drugs . 
   young educated people willing to work and whose education was at the expense of some other country ? 
  how can you improve on that ? 
  by giving it to their own countrymen and paying them a proper salary instead of enslaving people from other country in your own , significantly lowering the standard except for richs , who are even richers . 
  you are supposed to create your own job . 
  capitalism 101 . 
  wake up . 
  perhaps when you understand in what world we live you will move on from cleaning toilets with your neuroengineering phd diplm . 
  or perhaps you are not so skilled and intelligent as you believe and you are destinated to clean german toilets . 
  i actually agree . 
  let me expand . 
  their countries have invested thousands of euros , with the hope that they will eventually get it back . 
  as far as i know , germany 's low unemployment rate is thanks to their minijobs aka shitty jobs . 
  also german companies know they are desperate so they hire them to do the same job as a german for half of the money . 
  they are damaging both the north and the south enormously . 
  your tastes as wrong as usual . 
  uli uli uli by tonnin seteli . 
   we plan on carrying everything on our backs . 
  what are the most essential things that we need ? 
  exactly the same as you would carry travelling elsewhere , you are travelling to another continent , not another dimension .

  many sweden . 
  much yes . 
  wow, 
   ostrobothnians ( pampeser ) those around kokkola seem to understand finnish , or at least everyone i have met has . 
  never been to n\u00e4rpes though . 
  and what is finland then ? 
  finland is n't . 
  but i do n't like other people , they make me nervous . 
  i think you are also supposed to boil the water . 
  [ russian language was n't exactly popular when it was mandatory . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/j%c3%a4ger_movement ), 
  interestingly none of the swedish-speakers i know are blond , in fact the only blonds i have ever known have been finnish speakers . 
  they did try to russify us at one point , [ fortunately they did n't succeed ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/russification_of_finland ) . 
  true , just boil it in water and add ketchup !, 
   this old tradition is now under threat by antiwhite leftists seeking to make it an all inclusive celebration where all people can be included in the ritual , ** not just young beautiful scandinavian girls . 
  ** so they would n't like our [ lucia grandmas ] ( https://www.vaasa.fi/sv/nyheter/mirja-kristo-har-valts-till-vasas-lucia-mommo-2016 ) ? 
  so did the [ social democrats ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/social_democratic_party_ ( romania \\ ) ) won the elections ? 
  why are they bad ? 
  you could always buy gas from russia !, 
  so what do they do right in latvia and lithuania ? 
  and why did n't they make it 10 feet taller ? 
  i 'm more interested in football anyway . 
  the farmers would revolt . 
  why did we even do that . 
  damn , not only are you using us as your shield but we have to take care of your little bastard as well ? 
  that 's just evil . 
  oh it 's a job now , so when are you going to pay us ? 
   living in finland you essentially are a swede already . 
  are you serious ? 
  most finns , and swedes especially , would never agree with that . 
  edit : i suppose you are partially correct , there have always been strong swedish influences in our society , but there has always been a relatively large difference between western and eastern finland . 
   i definitely hope the eastern finns will wake up . 
  they 'll never `` wake up '' . 
  first of all the people living in finland , the finns , and the people living in the east have never really been the same people . 
  back in the old days , like centuries ago , western `` finns '' referred eastern `` finns '' as `` ryss\u00e4s '' and eastern finns called western finns `` ruotsis '' . 
  do you know what those words mean ? 
  also even if they had been the same people in the distant past , they have been raised as russians for several generations now , so in other words they are russians . 
  i have swedish ancestry and heritage so am i going to wake up as a swede one morning ? 
  i hope we have a plan in case euro falls apart , maybe sweden will let us use their krona ^ ^ [ pdf ] ( http://swopec.hhs.se/hastef/papers/hastef0224.pdf ) at least temporarily . 
  but why ? 
  are n't they oppressed ? 
  man you germans are stupid !, 
  do n't you know that cutting from education and r&d and investing barns is what winners do ? 
  maybe , but we do n't really have that many of them . 
  hey it 's nothing personal . 
  it is just that i would n't mind if there was , say , a sweden between us . 
  i actually have relatives there , maybe i should join them . 
  ahhhh warm weather and far away from russia . 
  so who are all the people moving to russia ? 
  true , but that does n't make the region swedish speaking , so maybe stripes would have been more accurate ? 
   is still a very prominent christmas symbol ( like this ) . 
  swedish speakers are a majority only in [ ostrobothnia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ostrobothnia_ ( region \\ ) ) , and if you count [ kokkola ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kokkola ) as a part of the `` swedish-coast '' then finnish speakers are a small majority . 
  woah colors !, 
  what 's that tower ?

  i can understand , and i can even sympathize to a degree , how russians would feel , however what i meant that here in finland we have people who still seem to genuinely believe in the friendship between finland and soviet union and the liturgy we were forced spout during the cold war . 
  i suppose that is understandable , however one should not look at our trade with soviet union through rose tinted glasses . 
  our trade with them did n't follow the principles of market economy which meant that we were completely unprepared for the collapse of the soviet union ( see : [ the finnish great depression : from russia with love ] ( http://www.nber.org/papers/w14874 ) ) . 
  good , after that we no longer had to grovel before them . 
  yet there are still people here who seem to be nostalgic about `` the good old days '' and of our `` friendship '' . 
  i wonder what is going on in their heads . 
  there are people in finland , including politicians , who seriously think that we should distance ourselves from eu and other western countries and focus on russia . 
  i wonder if those people are really that nuts or ... 
  thank god for our [ `` big brother '' ] ( https://tilastokeskus.fi/til/ssij/2015/ssij_2015_2016-10-27_kat_001_en_007.gif ) . 
  maybe you too can use sweden to counterbalance russia ? 
  not at all !, 
  it 's not like we have a tree that grows money . 
  no it 's just that the info here is wrong , totally !, 
  most of our billionaires are [ herlins ] ( https://fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/herlin ) who are the main owners of [ kone ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kone ) and [ cargotec ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cargotec ) .

  an emergency cock for those dark lonely nights . 
  i hope so , i have always had love for sweden . 
   because we really like them . 
  i thought you hated us . 
  i do n't know anyone who hates sweden irl , you swedes on the other hand do n't seem to like us . 
  at least you acknowledge our independence .

  erdogan and his inner circle ? 
  absolutely . 
  current reports appear to suggest that turkey is/will be using pretext of illegality of the act to deport the immigrants back to syria . 
  i do n't think you quite understand what `` press '' means . 
  let me help you : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/news_media note how `` television '' is but one small portion of `` press '' umbrella . 
  as for tv networks getting centralized and generally pushing agenda , that is true for essentially all western countries today unfortunately . 
  repealing of laws mandating competition between tv networks across the western world lead to centralized control over them . 
  russia is ahead of most western states on this issue , but is in no way an exception . 
  apologies . 
  i did not realise that we 're only allowed to talk about one specific talk point , which you will lead and the only acceptable answers are `` yes '' and `` no '' . 
  even if neither answer is obviously applicable , for reasons i listed . 
  the entire point of `` lack of alternatives '' makes `` votes in the nineties '' not impossible . 
  upper 90s , certainly . 
  lower , not so much . 
  you can see those kinds of support numbers in certain regions in the western coutries just as well . 
  this especially true in low population regions where everyone knows each other and peer pressure to `` vote correctly '' is immense . 
  again , i point you to the current structure of duma as obvious `` elephant in the room '' sized evidence that opposition in russia is alive and well . 
  flies on the wall you list do n't detract from it in any way . 
  where are you pulling those ridiculous claims of yours from ? 
  i said nothing that would even remotely resemble what you claim . 
  your naivete would be amusing , if it were n't dangerous . 
  over last five years or so , turkey was being effectively rebuked by both eu and us over its hardline islamisation and syria-related policies . 
  this has been a full 180 degree policy turn . 
  turkey gets support for its policies and money , which will be funneled through erdogan 's inner circle . 
  some of it will trickle down to refugees . 
  most will be used to secure erdogan 's position . 
  it 's fairly obvious that money is n't instantly transferred upon reaching agreement . 
  this suggestion implies utter lack of understanding how such agreements work in the most basic sense . 
  it 's also fairly obvious that any money that will be eventually awarded will be funneled through erdogan and his close circles . 
  you seem to think that because one autonomous region , that fought two bloody wars with russia and that is currently under control of a chechen with true chechen culture of `` my way , or fed to my lions '' , it 's relevant and applicable across russia . 
  hint : caucasus , especially violent muslim parts of it are but a tiny part of russia . 
  and it 's pretty obvious that 99 % are n't voting for united russia across the country with state of parliament , is n't it ? 
  i was talking about the way ireland treats abortion in general , not this ruling in particular . 
  it did n't come out as clearly as i intended to . 
  i think you 're missing the big picture here . 
  the end goal of erdogan is not membership of eu . 
  it 's reinforcing his rather shaky position as the de facto leader of turkey . 
  this will be achieved by visa free travel for turks and three billions , much of which will be siphoned to his close circle . 
  he basically won everything he wanted . 
  eu capitulated on this issue , us capitulated on not being forced to act as turkey 's and by extension al-nusra 's aggressions ' guarantor . 
  in terms of politics , he outplayed everyone at this juncture of history , except perhaps russia . 
  but even that remains to be seen , as it could also be a part of his plan . 
  if you think that visa free travel and billions in essentially free cash for erdogan 's closest circle is n't going to help erdogan to cement his position , i have bad news for you . 
  that 's what happened in one of the months of 2014 when there was an issue with gas fields rights over cyprus . 
  it most likely means that violations were simultaneous and across large portions of the border . 
  it was likely a part of pressure package to get greek cypriots to concede more rights to turkish cypriots . 
  the number was presented by greek military at the time , that 's why i remember it . 
  it sounded just as absurd to me as it does to you , until the context was made clear . 
  demands are indeed a hyperbole , designed to provide a negotiating position from which to back from in negotiations to come to an acceptable compromise . 
  parent 's statement that if current demands were to go through , eu would collapse are largely correct . 
  current list of demand , as far as i have seen them are utterly ridiculous , and would tear union apart very rapidly if implemented as-is . 
  they include things like massive limits on freedom of movement , freedom of work , equality among eu citizens and many other points . 
  poland has a new eurosceptic government that is n't known for being very logical in its actions based on their history . 
  i would not be surprised if they cut off their nose just to spite the face in upcoming negotiations . 
  but i suspect their main goal is going to be to keep the poles in britain working and receiving all the benefits . 
  that is the propagandist bs our press likes to peddle . 
  first of all , russia does have free press . 
  after ussr fell , russians feel very protective of freedom of speech they gained as glasnost came to be . 
  visit any magazine kiosk in st. petersburg , and you 'll find plenty of critical newspapers . 
  what keeps putin in power is not suppression of freedom of speech or critique . 
  what holds him in power is lack of viable alternatives . 
  allow me to elaborate . 
  you see , putin 's real opposition , and one that is n't generally mentioned in the west and holds significant portion of russian parliament does not have the kind of pull that putin and his party do in terms of what they offer . 
  russian opposition is formed by three major parties : communists , soclialists ( just russia ) and ultra nationalists ( ldpr ) . 
  what unites the opposition is that all of them are more critical of the west than ruling party . 
  none of them are viable as country 's ruling party , because they can not offer a viable plan . 
  communists are stuck in the past , just russia has a sort of `` let 's go halfway to the past and halfway stay where we are '' and ldpr is viewed by most people as a comedy show more so than anything , not to be taken seriously . 
  here , take a look for yourself : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/state_duma you could compare the situation to that of us and its two party system . 
  do you think that voters would vote for one of the two incumbent parties that largely all represent the same billionaires and multi-nationals if they had an alternative ? 
  of course not . 
  but there are no alternatives . 
  and that does n't mean that system is undemocratic . 
  it simply means it 's corrupt . 
  it already did and it succeeded . 
  it got 3 billion $ , visa-free travel in near future and restart of the membership talks . 
  all for just a series of vague promises . 
  i 'd call that a pretty successful blackmail . 
  that article talks about two people . 
  a few months ago , we had a group of six if i remember correctly . 
  increase in people coming did n't occur then either . 
  where is `` here '' ? 
  greek lack the resources to do the counter buzzing on the same scale . 
  there 's also the issue that antagonists are quite one-sided in terms of force available . 
  what are you on about ? 
  finland and baltics have the border under control . 
  smugglers tried to get a few groups of syrians smuggled a few months ago across our eastern border with no luck . 
  the issue is that there 's a specific deal between russia and norway in the north . 
  the place where the crossing is is in a generally a very low population area , so they had specific agreement in place to make it easy for locals to cross the border . 
  it 's fairly similar as one they have on the shared islands . 
  the problem is that people smugglers are abusing it . 
  the real problem is n't border security , but people smugglers looking for new routes . 
  for norway the smuggling from russia is a whole lot of a smaller problem than from sweden . 
  here in finland , pretty much all of those arriving here come from sweden just shipping them to our western border . 
  it 's ironic that we have a solid reinforced border with russia that is safe because both us and russians are watching it closely , and we trusted sweden to not need the old border structures which were torn down when we joined shengen zone . 
  and now , that border is the leaking one and we have not enough manpower to secure it . 
  right now , russia is a better neighbour in terms of border security and honouring agreements than sweden for us . 
  that 's not really how warfare works . 
  turkey is the aggressor in this one , and it needs to keep up its ability to suprise the greeks through constant buzzing of defences . 
  greeks can not afford to stop intercepting . 
  and no , they wo n't be making a `` deal '' just to save fuel and wear and tear on airframes with what 's at stake in this one .

  do you have to learn german or french ? 
  is it based on which state one lives ? 
  i 'm just curious because you have interesting language mixture in your country . 
  it can help also if you want to sell something in sweden . 
  then the swedish has to be good though . 
  i like the germans , do n't like their government/merkel much . 
  yes , in the 90 's there was mostly debate about trade aspects . 
  it was very hard to know what kind of things you would have to swallow with the free trade area . 
  ( financial crisis decisions , migration now , silly laws , federalism etc. ), 
  if estonia does n't implement this , it 's hard to see how they can into nordic !, 
  ( i would also post some polandball - strip , but they might be interpreted as homophobic ), 
   tax to cover cost will impose an extra burden on the countries that the refugees will go to instead . 
  let 's just blame switzerland and denmark loudly , and hope that they go back to softer approach !, 
  i could n't tell , and i wanted to be sure to include the stieg . 
   to him , our right wing parties are `` strongly leaning left '' , and our media is `` extremist left '' . 
   i think you might be exaggerating a bit here , but i get the gist . 
  i do n't know the concept ( ultra ) progressive that well really . 
  and i do n't claim that finnish and swedish media are the same or even very close . 
  sounds like it 's going to take some time before we have europe-wide solutions to this migration wave ... 
  this is why european borders should be controlled much more strictly , by money/resources given by all schengen countries . 
  the southern/eastern european countries are right to say that the costs and burdens of border control should be more evenly divided . 
  royal rumble 2016 . 
  finnish media leans left , by stats and eye-test . 
  hard to say about the others . 
   where would all those people who were not lucky enough to fit in quotas go ? 
  they would go to / stay in countries near the crisis area ? 
  or in quite a few cases , to another , more stable part of their country . 
  edit . 
  or as the australians do it , to some third country outside europe .

   i fail to see why the eu leaders want this partn\u0435rship with the ar\u0430bs so much . 
  it might be the european oil companies , who want it . 
  they get the cheapest oil from arab countries , and profit . 
  the oil companies influence the leaders , in various ways i 'm sure . 
  yeah , i should 've been clearer , i just meant to comment the viking part . 
  what i meant is that those paragraphs of that declaration were written ~ half a century ago . 
  should it still be valid for today 's situation , or should it be written or interpreted differently ? 
  i mean , ** some ** of the migrants coming to europe are just using our hospitality and those human rights agreements . 
  it feels like a massive waste to give housing & food to the economic tourists . 
  they can send their cv by e-mail , or visit the company 's stable local office . 
  huge part of the human rights defined in int . 
  agreements are self-evident , for sure . 
  but is this too , regardless of the situation ? 
  where does the universality come from ?

  they are supposed to be quite conservative .

  could be the same in sweden . 
  wallstr\u00f6m is a social democrat . 
  we do n't really even disagree . 
  you say above , that we should have agreements with morocco , turkey etc. 
  and control borders better . 
  sounds as good as i can think . 
  at the moment . 
  now wait , as much as i know , we were n't vikings ( or most of finns were n't ) , so i do n't think that 's our `` sin '' . 
  i 'm not sure if this is a jokey wwii reference or not , but yes , why not ? 
  they have such in turkey , jordan/lebanon , do n't they ? 
  the point is , that they are in europe or somewhere else . 
  it 's more expensive to host them in europe . 
  oh man , now you showed your cards . 
  one should always have - ( e ) xit card up your sleeve . 
  maybe it could be somewhere in africa , where the immigrants are taken ? 
  set some kind of camp there . 
  better for migrants , i 'm sure . 
  for eu countries , i would n't say . 
  the extent of right to asylum should be rethought and rewritten . 
  this mess just does n't work . 
  frontex should get more money and powers to work in southern europe . 
  joining and being in the eu * should be and feel like * a privilege . 
  thankfully , the forest companies have started and lately , been able to somewhat diversify away from paper production . 
  but yeah , we have problems . 
  denmark indeed is one of the most equal countries , at least measured by gini . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_income_equality nordic countries are doing decently in this sense . 
  still , the factory owner always `` lived in a mansion '' , and the cleaning lady did n't . 
  how far towards equality do we even need to go , so that there are still good incentives ? 
  deportation of migrants can be tough , because if there 's no passport , the claimed country of origin does n't always take them back . 
  also , in many cases they are not willing to take them back anyway . 
  i might be wrong , but greeks did n't want `` eu coast guard '' on their waters ? 
  it 's not like it 's not proposed . 
   thanks to the eu , the situation in europe is not just peaceful , but extremely peaceful is this really thanks to eu ? 
  what does eu do to eg . 
  franco-german relationship that enhances the peace between them ? 
  except the nuke thing ... 
  i 'm genuinely curious . 
  the most important will be , what the large eu countries do . 
  our politicians will do what germany does , unless it 's something totally outrageous . 
  and even now , we are being hit by russia sanctions all the time . 
  but , i actually want to see what happens if brits exit . 
  it would be an interesting precedence to other eu countries . 
   `` for many mainland europeans the eu offers the promise of freedom from the threat of nationalism '' that made me chuckle . 
  eu should be more efficient in running the things that are naturally run better by eu , and stay the f * ck out of member states ' business otherwise . 
  could this be a region/profession/social group thing ? 
  some of the countries , like iraq and i think afganistan , decline to take back some , or many , of the people that smaller western countries have decided to deport .

  when in doubt here 's some rules of thumb to keep you safer : * flagging a taxi may risk getting ripped off in some cities . 
  often ordering a proper taxi with the help of tourist information/hotel is less risky . 
  * ask for a price estimate beforehand , and keep an eye on the meter . 
  does n't prevent inflated tourist prices but makes * surprise rip-off * prices less likely . 
  * if the driver asks for a ridiculous price and then intimitades or threatens you , keep calm and remember that he really does not want trouble with authorities . 
  * do not just step into a taxi and ask the driver to take you somewhere to * ` have a good time - wink , wink ' * . 
  in some cities the driver may take you to a place where : 1 ) you will get seriously ripped off , 2 ) you will not have good time but possibly get threatened , and 3 ) the return trip will cost much more . 
  in such cases the driver and the place are working together to both rip you off . 
   would like to have you opinion guys , will the swastika ever be seen as something else than nazi symbolism ever again ? 
  i think * the * swastika will be seen as a nazi symbol for a long time in many countries in europe , assuming by * the * swastika you mean [ the swastika nazis used ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/swastika#mediaviewer/file:flag_of_german_reich_%281935%e2%80%931945%29.svg ) as their symbol . 
  but i 'm not sure if that will apply similarily to * any * swastika in the long run . 
  and if you look at it globally , swastikas as symbols have different connotations depending on who ask . 
  and at least here in finland the finnish air force had a swastika as a symbol well before the nazis and it has remained as one of the symbols in use , e.g. 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/training_air_wing,_finnish_air_force there 's also a swastika in some of the finnish official decorations such as [ the i class of the order of the cross of liberty for peacetime merits ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/61/grootkruis_en_ster_vredesklasse_van_het_vrijheidskruis.jpg ) and a swastika also appears in [ the presidential standard of finland . 
  ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7b/presidential_standard_of_finland.svg ) and of course , none of them is the nazi swastika , and their origins have no relation to nazis but are from times well before them . 
  not just any swastika is the nazi swastika , and a swastika does not equal to nazi for everyone . 
  imagine if the nazis had chosen a some kind of circle as their symbol . 
  would all circles be nazi ever since , everywhere ?

   there is no way such a term could be implemented . 
  gas is a commodity . 
  they do exist in some gazprom contracts . 
  but such clauses restricting gas resales are probably illegal in the eu , and there is an ongoing antitrust case regarding them : [ antitrust : commission opens proceedings against gazprom ] ( http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_ip-12-937_en.htm?locale=fr ) ( 04/09/2012 ) in addition to gazprom 's resale clauses the case also covers its monopolistic pricing behavior and clauses restricting gas flows ( e.g.

   russia really could use a better image right now or something positive/not hostile coming from russian government would be a nice change of pace . 
  apparently not even [ alexey gromov ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/alexey_gromov ) can provide such image enhancement any more . 
   maaaaaybe future possibilities of diversifying our nat.gas / oil trade routes somewhere apart from europe , thus when europe moves away from russian energy sources little by little ( strengthening their negotiation position in result ) russia could also have some other place to sell ( eventually doing the same ) . 
  yes , by 2020s russia will likely export more energy and more of its resource commodities to china . 
  but the thing is those exports wo n't replace the volumes ( and probably not prices ) exported to the eu and especially volume of the energy ( oil , natural gas ) exported to china will remain a fraction of what is currently exported to the eu . 
  and the other very important thing of note is china 's long term strategy : china will never choose to import a major fraction of its energy sources from russia and risk becoming dependend in the process . 
  they already have the eu as a warning example , and china 's long term strategy has always been to hedge its bets and to diversify as exemplified by [ this graph . 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/1am18b6.jpg ) despite their propagandist rhetorics the biggest external mid-to-long term threat to the oligarchy currently ruling russia is not nato , it 's the eu energy union . 
   has the eu got enough money to aid the development of another poor nation ? 
  the aid provided and promised so far , albeit substantial , is peanuts to the eu . 
  the real question is can ukraine itself 1 ) have stability against russia 's destabilization efforts , and 2 ) to progress with its societal , judicial , anti-corruption and economic reforms to entice further investement from the private sector .

  also , some months ago , during the crimean pseudo-referendum , this was happening in chinese social media : [ netizens compare lost chinese territory to crimea crisis ] ( http://www.chinasmack.com/2014/stories/netizens-compares-lost-chinese-territory-to-the-crisis-in-crimea.html ) those chinese netizens did n't seem to be too happy about how the red army occupied and annexed large regions of china using pseudo-referendums :  the russia that has never done any good ; if it 's not destroyed , then there is no justice in the world . 
  so , if we were to follow putin 's ideas through , and go by his silly principle of what has ` historically belonged ' to where , russia would become quite a bit smaller .

  they have done so by cynically fanning ethnic russian chauvinism towards crimean tatars and ethnic ukrainians , through manipulation of issues like the status of the russian language , nato , and an alleged tatar threat to `` slavs , '' in a deliberate effort to destabilize crimea , weaken ukraine , and prevent ukraine 's movement west into institutions like nato and the eu .

   they probably came up with the story because a dutch navy submarine and three other vessels are visiting tallinn right now . 
  yes , they were in tallinn but left yesterday .

  professor logachev is one of the ships of interest which may or may not be related to the current events , we do n't know . 
  the ship has capabilities to work with mini submarines , [ has an array of relevant instruments , and also a heavy cargo boom for rov operation with lift capacity of 16 tons .

  the timing of its sailing might be related , or might be a coincidence , we do n't know . 
   other than being a submarine , there is no relation to the event in sweden . 
  indeed . 
  the foreign vessel they 're currently searching for is certainly not the dutch submarine which visited sweden a week ago . 
  but in a way the foreing underwater activity in sweden may be related to the earlier joint exercise . 
  it 's possible a foreing vessel may have entered there to gather intelligence during the exercise , but for some reason has remained after the exercise was over .

  the peking olympics was a great example of this .

  it would be an excellent sanction because it does n't cost jobs for usa or eu people .

  even if that guy is trolling , he is giving an straight view to the mindset of russian army : they are ready to roll .

  i 've shot with that gun myself , it 's still in use in finnish defence forces , remnants of the ussr days when we were forced to by a lot of ussr stuff . 
  it 's old gun but does it job . 
  seriously outdated anyway , it 's from 1950 's ... 
  but every hour we are getting more and more proof of russian direct involvement in ukraine . 
  this shit is about to blow ... 
  who would believe that the russia will be in this phase 5 years ago ? 
  or during the sochi olympics ? 
  are the people in russia believing that they are as might as the ussr was ( militarily ) ? 
  in fact they are 1/10 ^ th of the strength of those days and their equipment is 80 % from the 1970 's era . 
  also their gdp is the size of italy and there is only 110million people in russia ( eu is 550million ) . 
  this is one reason putin is using this kinda warfare in ukraine . 
  he massed 45,000 + troops to the ukraine border two months ago but pulled them back and realised that he 'll be fucked if he would go in with tank spearheads and btr columns . 
  not that ukraine army could n't stop them effectively , but that the world would have crushed russia 's economy and his people would have revolt against him . 
  now he keeps doing this `` arming at nights '' operation and `` maskirovka '' in media ( maskirovka is russian disguising , hazing the truth behind lies and false truth etc. ) . 
  he has done great job at the russian media to rally his people and his popularity ratings are amazingly high . 
  those numbers are so high that it looks like the country is getting ready for war . 
   russia 's defense spending has nearly doubled since 2010 , reaching a total of $ 70 billion this year .

  they probably have cover words for their own stuff , like locations , weapons and they probably use fake calls too . 
  but this is such a major clusterfuck that they are in panic and the pressure is enormous . 
  they have no time to cover things and that 's why they just have to say things clear and loud to get the message through . 
  also the pressure from moscow must be tense and they fear that they 'll be abandoned by putin : it would be their end . 
  they have to make thousands of phone-calls over this situation and those who are clever enough can hide some keywords but it 's always this level that fucks up the most : the last chain .

   male circumcision : everything keeps on working fine . 
  female circumcision : no feelings anymore , just pain . 
  forever . 
  that is incorrect . 
   honestly , this aspect of the whole `` animal rights '' thing does n't really elicit any great sympathy from me . 
  honestly , your lack of sympathy towards pain and suffering caused to animals is irrelevant . 
  your misinformed claim was that animal welfare laws are about ` indirect expulsion ' which they are not . 
   whether or not we bonk them on the head before slitting their throat seems to me to be a pointless argument . 
  if it is pointless whether animals are ` bonked ' or not then why not ` bonk ' them ? 
  and if it is pointless why you even argued that ` bonking ' the animals would mean some sort of ` indirect expulsion ' ? 
  over here we do ` bonk ' to avoid causing undue stress , pain and suffering to animals . 
  and over here person 's religious beliefs are not a legal reason to cause undue pain or suffering to animals . 
  that table leaves out countries such as malaysia and indonesia , and does not provide worldwide prevalence of different types of fgm . 
  in indonesia alone fgm concerns almost 2 million infant girls annually . 
  by far most of the fgm 's performed are type iv such as rubbing , scraping or pinching clitoral hood with an instrument or making an incision on clitoral hood . 
  only small part of the fgm 's performed are type i where part of clitoris or clitoral hood are cut away . 
  and yes , even symbolic rituals with no permanent injury to the genital tissues are indeed categorized as female genital mutilation . 
  but there has been a worrying trend in the * medicalization * of fgm in indonesia : traditional healers/midwives have preferred more of a symbolic types of fgm ( type iv ) but medical personnel tend to perform more incisions and even excisions ( type i ) with their instruments . 
  local islamic clerics ' position on the issue is : [ cleric : do n't cut too much female genital to avoid sexuality loss ] ( http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2010/03/26/cleric-don%e2%80%99t-cut-too-much-female-genital-avoid-sexuality-loss.html ) relevant research report : [ female circumcision in indonesia - extent , implications and possible interventions to uphold women 's health rights ] ( http://www.popcouncil.org/pdfs/frontiers/reports/indonesia_fgm.pdf ), 
   jews have been expelled from countries many times throughout history , sometimes explicitly ( `` jews are no longer allowed in england '' ) and sometimes indirectly ( `` kosher slaughter is no longer allowed in the rhineland '' ) . 
  this would merely the latest in a long line of indirect expulsions . 
  laws banning methods of slaughter that cause undue stress , pain and suffering to animals are not about ` expulsion ' of anyone . 
  they 're about animal welfare . 
  for example , in finland and denmark the animal welfare laws say that the animal must be stunned before blooding to avoid causing such undue stress , pain and suffering to the animal . 
  person 's religious beliefs are not a legal reason to cause undue pain or suffering to animals . 
  for example a devil worshipper can freely believe in a dark fairy but an act of torturing animals to death is illegal even if it was done as a ritual belonging to that religion . 
  for example in indonesia and malaysia the most prevalent forms of fgm are scraping or scratching the clitoral hood with an instrument , or making an incision on the clitoral hood without removing anything . 
   the form where the clitoris is removed is much more severe ( let alone sewing up the vagina , or whichever other horrors ) those are the least prevalent forms of fgm . 
  removing the foreskin is the most prevalent form of mgm and it 's worse than the most prevalent forms of fgm : scratching or making an incision on the clitoral hood . 
  it already is : western women do get surgical trims to their genitals which are comparable to the prevalent form of fgm : making an incision on the clitoral hood , as it enhances sexual stimulus . 
  trimming the labia for estethic reasons has also gained popularity . 
  arguably one can do without actual hard walls if necessary .

  healthy wolfpacks with wide enough territories with game are no risk to humans . 
  they actually keep away from humans . 
  risk factors may rise with illnesses ( rabies ) , lack of game or space , and by getting used to humans . 
  but a wolf attacking human is very rare indeed . 
  and / r/europe is also wrong sub for them . 
   says the european parliament report not european parliament 's report . 
  a demos report , published with the support of the socialists and democrats group in the european parliament : [ corruption , political instability and intolerance : europe 's decade of decline ] ( http://www.socialistsanddemocrats.eu/newsroom/corruption-political-instability-and-intolerance-europe%e2%80%99s-decade-decline ), 
   in general does n't mean never unfortunately , and it would only be a matter of time before someone gets killed . 
  assuming a very long time scale as it is a very rare occurence . 
  in finland the last time a wolf ( allegely ) killed a person happened in 1881 . 
  similar unfortunate effect happens in some areas of countryside in sw finland . 
  an otherwise dark area in the countryside well outside city lights is filled with orange flood from the greenhouses . 
  imagine if the greenhouses had some kind of semitransparent glazing : in the daytime it would let the sunshine in , and in the nighttime it would reflect the artificial light back inside . 
  the lights would need less power , consume less energy , and you 'd also have less light pollution . 
   during almost all of the dark season , the ground is covered by snow , which brightens up the sky . 
  right , the map does not account for the effects of snow . 
  the researchers say they plan to have it included in their future maps . 
  appears to be a matter of definitions . 
  the numbers by that lecture account only for * solid * particulate matter as aerosols , but when one discusses scattering of starlight in the visible spectrum by aerosols in the atmosphere that also includes the effects of mist , haze and water . 
  the amount of water in the atmosphere is higher on an ocean than a desert , therefore causing more scattering of starlight in the visible spectrum , and thusly contributing to the visual brightess of the night sky background . 
  and around the falkland islands .

  quite . 
   if anything the swedish name should be prioritized since it 's the name by which the city was originally founded . 
  depends . 
  for example st. michel was probably only ever used in official papers . 
  the common people ( who did n't speak swedish ) would have used mikkeli from day 1 . 
  this is n't even archaic practice . 
  my mother 's name is written in swedish form on her papers because the priest refused to write finnish names to official papers . 
  neither she nor her parents spoke swedish . 
  so the question is pretty much is the `` real name '' the one used by the lords or the one used by the people ? 
  i would remember that algeria 's petition to join was put down citing location . 
  are there any vacancies ? 
  there 's also the chance of changing a town name when it becomes a political hindrance . 
  nikolainkaupunki/nikolaistad ( the former and later vaasa/wasa ) is no longer on the map . 
  st michel is mikkeli in finnish and does n't have `` saint '' in the name . 
  the same for the other examples . 
  hitler was n't known for his prose . 
  the annotations probably explain how the chapters reflect hitler 's later policies - both implemented and those left on the drafting table . 
  when i was a kid , we called those potatoes ( which we had never seen , only heard about ) `` kinder potatoes '' , as they had a surprise inside !, 
  the exams are n't the end of your life , but it does give you some path dependency . 
  ( though admittedly people who get straight top marks - i almost wrote `` straight a 's - may not be the sort of people who go on to accomplish much in life . 
  you need certain skills to remember facts and certain skills to succeed in organisations . 
  but in general is better to do very well than very badly . ), 
  sometimes the light bulbs have been removed to discourage closing the doors . 
  in the old days when relatively few had the right to wear those hats , they were status and class symbols and were worn through the summer . 
  i see this as an alternative for a summer cottage . 
  renting it now and then is n't the same . 
  part of the charm is to make it your own . 
  maintenance is probably a bitch ( on the least you have to find a place to store it for winter ) , but i 'll be rich when this happens , so who cares !, 
   this really is n't true in this naive way . 
  firstly , stranger rape and acquaintance rape are completely different . 
  true . 
   this is something that is not explicitly distinguished in research that uses a broadly feminist model of gender relations ( at least for the studies i know ) . 
  is the difference made in raw stats ? 
  i 'm unsure . 
   secondly , we know that a majority of rapists , particularly those that have no psychopathology , do n't prefer rape to normal sex , but instead at worst are n't repulsed by rape to the extent a control population is , but often were n't cognisant of the fact that they were raping . 
  i did try to illustrate this . 
   thirdly , rape overall is vastly more prevalent between the ages of roughly 14 and 30 than any other time , for victim and perpetrator . 
  this can not be explained by the `` rape is about power '' idea you could assume that the perpetrator might respect elder people and is less likely to see them as something that need to be `` put in their place '' . 
  but i 'm not basing this on any research . 
   particularly as acquaintance rape is concerned , which is again a vast majority of cases . 
  op was talking about immigrants not having girlfriends and thus `` roaming the streets at night looking for someone to rape '' . 
  i suspect they did n't mean female friends . 
  but yes , i tried to write keeping this in mind , though i did n't want to muddle my point by dwelling on this . 
   it is primarily stranger rapists , and among those especially people with psychopathology ( serial rapists , people with mental illnesses , et cetera ) who rape for domination , and that 's the minority . 
  i was trying to get to this . 
  that 's why i specified that i will be in the money then . 
   it does if you build them railroads . 
  / s the end-result in finland being that many of the original railroads go from west-east ( to transport military from russia ) when the roads go north-south ( as the commerce works ) . 
  that and we have different gauge than the countries with whom we actually have a border union with . 
  it 's not the same : /, 
   put it this way : chinese people rape less than white people in china and in their own country . 
  if there were a million chinese people brought into europe , we could expect the rate of rape to go down . 
  you have two cases , interesting assumption and a really interesting conclusion . 
  let me break it down to you and offer an alternative explanation : ** chinese in china ** : we can assume either - you : chinese do n't rape in china ( that often ) . 
  the reason has to be something in the upbringing ( and perhaps social pressure ) . 
  - me : rapes happen by natives but they are n't recorded due to social stigma . 
  ** white people in china ** : we can assume either - you : whites rape more than they do in their home country , suggesting that they followed rules only from upbringing and social pressure - the first which they abandoned when they moved to china and the latter which they do n't feel at china . 
  - me : whites rape on the same frequency as they did back home , but that they are reported more easily . 
  as chinese probably are xenophobic , reporting rapes done by foreigners probably carries less stigma . 
  ** base assumption ** : - you : ~ ~ chinese in europe and europeans in china are fully switchable scenarios . ~ ~ * chinese would n't rape in europe * any more than in china . 
  - me : people have different upbringing and are likely to do wrong assumptions about certain societal norms . 
  it might be understandable if you move from more lax environment to more strict one that certain problems arise . 
  thus rape-numbers might rise if whites go to china or chinese go to europe , but not both . 
  ** we can hypothesise ** either - you : ~ ~ people naturally rape but our upbringing and ties to society keep us `` grounded '' . 
  thus chinese will rape in europe in droves , * far higher rape reports than the locals * . ~ ~ * i do n't actually know , because you said whites raped more in china than at europe , but the same would n't do to other direction * - me : chinese had problems in the rape records . 
  ( would be interested to see these numbers and see if the numbers vary between non-chinese asians , blacks and whites . ), 
  when they come here , they will continue raping as they did back home , but * chinese are reported competitively more often , but not on as heavy ratio as whites in china * , as the rape report does n't have as big stigma as it does in china . 
  edit : i misread the original quote . 
  edited . 
   some groups are more prone to rape than others . 
  men for example rape more than women . 
  a lot depends on stuff like how you define rape ( and how you define `` normal behaviour '' ) . 
  i grant that if person 's definition of `` normal behaviour '' and society 's definition of `` rape '' are at odds , rape numbers will increase or decrease . 
  to take the example you provided , in [ england rape means that you penetrate a vagina or an asshole ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rape_in_english_law ) . 
  so woman would be incredibly hard to break this law . 
  there 's also a question between the disparity between rapes and reported rapes - do men rape more or are rapes done by females reported less ? 
  second , if a person is without a `` normal social life '' and a girlfriend ( as descripted above ) , would they be interested in raping ? 
  or consuming large amounts of porn ( or by self-improvement ) ? 
  research shows us that rape is done as a power-play , not because a man ca n't control himself . 
  if we have a person who 's interested in showcasing power , they 're more likely to be people who are attracted to power and fame in all forms : jocks , politicians , influential people . 
  that 's why danger of rape does n't directly correlate with victim 's beauty . 
  they would n't be nerds who are content in sitting home studying japanese ( as many of my friends did ) . 
  tldr : the stereotype of rapist raping from lack of alternatives does n't represent the reality . 
  rape happens because of power-play or because the rules between individuals and society does n't match and is ( to some extend ) caused by mistakes , as the assange-case illustrates . 
  acting like rapists are lonely people does a lot of harm to innocents while making us oblivious to the real predators . 
  ( bill cosby ca n't be a rapist - he could get any woman he wanted !, 
  or pay for a courtesan !, 
  go fling that mud somewhere else ! ), 
  that 's what i 'll buy when i finally make it . 
  it 's a muddy topic . 
  hawaii for example was quite clearly a colony . 
  does it stop being a colony when the population is given a voting franchise , keeping in mind that as the local population will never be more than small minority of the whole federation , they ca n't really rock the boat ? 
   how do you know anything about defines the motivations of a rapist ? 
   seriously , you 're talking out of your ass . 
  unless you 're actually a rapist , in which case ... reading psychological and sociological studies on the subject helps . 
  one has a lot of time to do that when you do n't have to take care of social life . 
  and does that justify colonisation ? 
  the definition according to cambridge dictionary is   a country or area controlled politically by a more powerful country that is often far away notice `` often '' . 
   the thing that will happen is a shit ton of immigrant `` young adults '' without a girlfriend or normal social life will be roaming the streets at night looking for someone to rape because they have no girlfriend i do n't know about you , but when i was 17 and without social life or a girlfriend , i just watched anime . 
  and i doubt it was because my flair has a nordic cross .

  look at the stats then : http://www.tradingeconomics.com/russia/wage-growth  real wages in russia decreased 9 percent year-on-year in november , following a downwardly revised 10.5 percent drop in the previous month . 
  meanwhile , nominal wages increased by 4.6 percent , while real disposable income shrank 5.4 percent . 
   edit : it 's now past 81.8 to dollar , past 89 to euro   edit : it 's going to break 82 to the dollar   edit : it 's now heading for 82.5 to the dollar , it made it past 90 to the euro . 
  yep , this is ruble 's black wednesday alright . 
  looks like breaking the 80 triggered some tripwires . 
  unfortunately i 'm quite fond of it and will not give it away easily . 
  you should see the chrystal clear skies that come with this coldness and the dancing northern lights . 
   nope : yes they are saying that . 
  i just quoted the relevant part from their report :  eia estimates that global oil inventories increased by 1.9 million b/d in 2015 , marking the second consecutive year of inventory builds . 
  this oversupply has contributed to oil prices reaching the lowest monthly average level since mid-2004 . 
  ** inventories are forecast to rise by an additional 0.7 million b/d in 2016 , before the global oil market becomes relatively balanced in 2017 . 
  ** the first draw on global oil inventories in 15 consecutive quarters is expected in the third quarter of 2017 . 
  apparently it is you who has not read the report at all . 
  let 's see your quote :  the 2015 growth occurred mainly in north america . 
  eia expects non-opec production to decline by 0.6 million b/d in 2016 , which would be the first decline since 2008 . 
  most of the forecast decline in 2016 is expected to be in the united states . 
  that does not contradict anything i have said . 
  yes , * in 2015 * the growth occured mainly in north america . 
  and yes , the eia expects non-opec production to fall by 600,000 bpd through 2016 most of that in the us . 
  so what ? 
  meanwhile , iran has just said they 'll bring 500,000 bpd on the market as soon as they can , and 1,000,000 bpd by the year 's end . 
  that will more than compensate for the mere 600,000 bpd eia estimates to leave the market in 2016 . 
   and here 's a graph from the same page that you seem to miss out -- note the oversupply shrinking : http://i.imgur.com/7e0pwvd.png that graph shows supply exceeding demand through 2016 . 
  which is what i have said . 
  again it looks like the eia agrees with me . 
   i just see no question for arguments here : libya have literally no inlfuence over today 's oil market . 
  never said that , and i do n't know where you got that `` today 's '' from as i excplicitly said it was a * future * consideration . 
  please do read what i wrote before you choose comment on it . 
  that 's what discussion forums are for : read , consider and then give your opinion . 
  and `` nope '' is not an argument , it 's simple childish denial . 
  wrong thread , mate . 
   half of winter is over . 
  good to hear . 
  it 's currently -37 \u00b0 c outside . 
  just 3 more months to go . 
  * do not dress as a suicide bomber or as a woman . 
   you 'd better read some eia analysis first . 
  i have , and eia is saying the same : stockpiles growing , global glut worsening . 
  also the iea says the same - here 's the latest tl ; dr : http://washpost.bloomberg.com/story?docid=1376-o169356jtseb01-5gcp89el4h18m8e44ifcjm9tl8  crude dropped to the lowest in more than 12 - years in new york after the international energy agency said the global market could `` drown in oversupply . ''  west texas intermediate futures fell 3.3 percent . 
  the iea cut 2016 estimates for global oil demand as china 's economic growth weakens , and raised forecasts for output outside the organization of petroleum exporting countries . 
  the removal of restrictions on iranian crude sales is seen prolonging the supply glut . 
  brent futures rebounded as data showed chinese growth was in line with government targets  `` there 's just too much oil out there , '' said kyle cooper , director of research with iaf advisors and cypress energy capital management in houston . 
  `` while we 're not going to be getting any deliveries of iranian crude , they will displace other oils which will head here . 
  there 's no light at the end of the tunnel . '', 
  ...  nope . 
  great argument . 
  i mean , you have no argument at all . 
  edit : as you ninjaedited your comment . 
   first , the oil market is a virtual market , and all that linear modeling is well off the mark here . 
  whatever you choose to call it does not mean supply and demand are not present . 
  they very much are . 
  your opinion about ` linear modeling ' does not change the fact that we 're in an oil glut . 
  globally . 
  stockpiles are at historical high and growing , as supply is exceeding the growth of demand . 
   second , even if we do talk about adding and removing supply , i strongly suggest you to read some eia analysis first . 
  i have , and their analysis supports what i said . 
  for example , this is what eia says in their latest outlook jan 12th :  eia estimates that global oil inventories increased by 1.9 million b/d in 2015 , marking the second consecutive year of inventory builds . 
  this oversupply has contributed to oil prices reaching the lowest monthly average level since mid-2004 . 
  ** inventories are forecast to rise by an additional 0.7 million b/d in 2016 ** , before the global oil market becomes relatively balanced in 2017 . 
  the first draw on global oil inventories in 15 consecutive quarters is expected in the third quarter of 2017 . 
  very good point !, 
   nope , that means nothing in global context . 
  of course 500,000 to 1,000,000 bpd more to the market does matter on the global context !, 
  the demand will not grow at the same pace as supply this year , and there wo n't be anyone removing that much from the market this year . 
  additionally , the storages are at historic high and oil just keeps on piling up . 
  they 're already renting oil tankers as storage as on-shore facilities are getting full . 
  another , albeit still tentative , political development to keep an eye on through this year and the next is the development in libya . 
  yesterday the rival factions in libya announced their agreement to form a unity government . 
  there are still many issues to solve which will not be easy but it is the first small step towards political stability . 
  due to political instability libya 's oil production has fallen drastically with only 370,000 bpd produced in december while it used to be 1,600,000 bpd . 
  if the rivaling factions in libya continue taking steps towards stability they have the potential of bringing over 1,000,000 bpd to the market - but even in the best case scenario that will take time and would probably become more relevant in 2017 . 
   iran has almost nothing to do with the current oil price . 
  there is of course multiple reasons for the low prices , but it was iran 's return to the market that made the prices fall below $ 30 . 
  iran has said they 'll bring 500,000 bpd to the market as soon as possible , and 1,000,000 bpd by the year 's end . 
  that means the oil glut will not only continue but is getting worse . 
   what 's the stance of the russian central bank ? 
  will they just let it float or try to stabilize it ? 
  last week the rcb said they can not rule out interest rate hike . 
  that was a week ago and ruble has depreciated more since then , but i do n't think they 'll intervene unless ruble keeps falling a lot more . 
  rcb 's problem is having two opposite goals : on one hand they need to allow ruble to weaken to support the gov budget , and on the other hand they have their stated inflation targets which are harder to keep with weakening ruble . 
  balancing between those is a challenge indeed . 
  [ how about a wookie ? 
  is it safe to dress as a wookie ?

   why would sa cut output ? 
  they are the most efficient producer on the planet . 
  yup . 
  but let 's not forget the kurdish producers - some of their oil companies have exceedingly low costs , such as genel with production costs of about $ 1 per barrel . 
  barclays regards kurdish companies genel and dno as among the most resilient companies to low oil prices , and has an overweight recommendation on both . 
  yes the us lifted the export ban that had been in effect since the '70s . 
  but that expected decision has been in the making for years and not necessarily aimed at russia . 
  yup . 
  saudi arabia 's economy is projected to keep growing even if in a lower pace than before : +1.2 % for 2016 and +1.9 % for 2017 as per the latest imf and hsbc projections published yesterday . 
  i hope we get one more of those epic speeches by guy verhofstadt . 
  and in other news the norwegian oil and gas company statoil is planning a new large investment : [ statoil moves ahead with $ 7 billion arctic field after cost cuts ] ( http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-01-19/statoil-moves-ahead-with-7-billion-arctic-field-after-cost-cuts )  statoil plans to invest 50 billion kroner to 60 billion kroner ( $ 7 billion ) in the johan castberg development in the barents sea , compared with about 100 billion kroner earlier , ceo eldar saetre said in a speech tuesday in sandefjord , norway . 
  production may start in 2022 after a final decision in 2017 , according to a draft plan , which includes using a floating production , storage and offloading vessel , he said . 
   `` this is a project that 's starting to get close to what i would call an attractive project , '' saetre said in an interview . 
  at least half of the contracts will be awarded to norwegian suppliers , he said earlier . 
  well , as norway has a diverse economy it 's not all doom and gloom :  even as low prices are putting the brakes on the oil and gas industry , other parts of the economy are benefiting from a weakening of the krone that has made exports more competitive . 
   `` it 's a two-speed situation in norway , '' said storset .

  i was just talking about the stereotype . 
  i 'm hoping for a cold winter with lots and lots of snow . 
  the last two winters have been a bit depressing with nothing but rain and slush . 
  add not seeing the sun for months on end and it gets pretty dull . 
  but snow fixes everything about it !, 
  yeah , usually it 's finland that is alcoholic and sad but i think the dark winters bring sadness jokes to all nordics to some degree . 
  depends on what is needed for the joke . 
  [ nordic winter summed up ] ( https://i.imgur.com/mbtuzjw.jpg ), 
   only sadness and \u00f8l ... 
  confirmed scandinavian . 
  sounds fun , plz gib clay !, 
  i second this !, 
  i wish there were more quality tv-shows from the german point of view . 
  uhh , not sure why you think winter war is especially boring . 
  you could pretty much say that about every war . 
  `` trees everywhere and americans crouching in foxholes '' etc. 
  yes , according to this piece of news a reunification of a family of four requires a salary of 2600e ( which is below finnish average ) . 
  both parents are counted towards this goal , so if the spouse coming from e.g. 
  iraq has a job readily lined up for them that is ok . 
  the reason for refusing a 1500e salary for reunification of spouse and two kids is that you can not support a family of four in finland with that kind of money , finland just is that expensive . 
  so the reunified family would still end up on welfare . 
  apparently the ministry has placed the minimun on a level that requires no welfare which is better for finland but worse for the refugees . 
  as / u/cat _ in_the_ass said it depends on many factors . 
  i 'd expect a finnish university graduate programmer to earn somewhere around 3500e/month . 
  at least the union page says so . 
  yes , it 's true that cleaning is one of the most available occupations for immigrants/refugees . 
  a refugee with no finnish skills was a cleaner at my former workplace . 
  i think you can just link to them and people who are interested can use a translator . 
  wow that is messed up , especially cleaning apprenticeship sounds horrible . 
  this is the same thing that employers require 10 years of experience from 20 year old applicants . 
  luckily i do n't think it is as bad in finland as you said . 
  at one place i used to work at we had a refugee cleaning that did n't know finnish at all . 
  really ? 
  i would be quite shocked if i went to a restaurant and the waiter could n't speak finnish to me . 
  is this true ? 
  do you have a source ? 
  the article speaks of 30 000 people so it is very misleading if it is only about the quota refugees . 
  i ca n't find any statistics on how many refugees learn finnish so i ca n't speak with facts . 
  but i 've read from the news that many of them drop out from finnish courses and stick to others speaking the same language as they do . 
  i may have been wrong with what i said earlier about learning the language . 
  your personal experiences have been good , which is really nice . 
  but it ca n't be extrapolated to all refugees . 
  i 've only ever met one refugee and he did n't speak one word of finnish . 
  he was a cleaner at our company so no language skills were required . 
  but i do n't mean that based on him no one learns finnish !, 
  yes , but still everyday work is done in finnish . 
  you do n't hear english on the factory floor . 
  no problem !, 
  i have n't read it anywhere but i 'm sure that they can choose which language test ( finnish or swedish ) they take . 
  i used the same headline as the finnish state run yle news agency used . 
  this website is n't some rightwing nutjob conspiracy site but run by the finnish government . 
  refugees get free language courses and other social integration courses . 
  did you even bother to read the article ? 
   for example the ministry is well aware of the improbability of family members coming from iraq or syria being able to meet the finnish language requirement . 
   `` it 's highly unlikely that this would end up in the regulations , '' tuunanen said . 
  i think you are mixing refugees to regular immigrants . 
  nothing stops eu citizens from moving here and working and others from getting a visa and coming here . 
  about working in finland in english : very hard . 
  the only field that i can think of that has lots of english speaking workers is programming . 
  almost all work places are filled with finnish speaking people so it is almost impossible to find work without knowledge of finnish . 
  that 's unfortunately true . 
  it is likely that most of them will be unemployed for the rest of their lives in finland . 
  every party is publicly welcoming as many refugees as possible , not wanting refugees is not politically correct . 
  but i imagine behind the scenes all government parties want the flow of immigrants to stop and that is where we get this kind of requirements . 
  usually the finns party has been against immigration but once they got a government seat they also have been quite quiet about this . 
  the greens and the left want to bring everyone to finland but they 're in opposition . 
  i think the public opinion is against taking any more refugees . 
  there have been lots of negative news lately regarding refugees ( rape , crime etc. ), 
  which propably affects the public opinion . 
  i do n't have any study about the real opinions though . 
  yes , it 's the same here . 
  not much unskilled labour needed , mainly just cleaning and telemarketing ( requires finnish language ) . 
  maybe the newcomers could be put to school once they have a grasp of the language ? 
  that 's true , usually they neither learn the language nor get a job . 
  maybe this drives a change in that too . 
  there is n't a minimum wage by law in finland per se , unions regulate wages . 
  as an example for a `` minimun wage worker '' , a cleaner might earn something around 1500e monthly if they get full hours . 
  median wage is around 3000e which reguires that you have a school diploma , for example an electrician or a plumber . 
  sounds good to me , stops unemployed refugees bringing more unemployed people here . 
  also makes them learn the language . 
  if they have a job and are able to support their family , reunification should n't be much of a problem .

  now sweden ca n't put them on trains and ship them to finland as they 've already applied for asylum . 
  absolutely , but for some reason this is completely unthinkable to our politicians . 
  the next best thing is sweden closing their borders , so i 'm just glad this finally happened . 
  yes , but after sweden has sent the lot of them currently in sweden here the flow should stop . 
  from another [ article ] ( http://www.thelocal.se/20151111/sweden-set-to-mount-border-checks ) :  according to ygeman the introduction of border controls means that refugees coming to sweden face three choices : to return to the country they came from , seek asylum in sweden or , for those just passing through sweden , to choose a different route to their final destination . 
  sounds pretty good , no more uncontrolled masses of migrants . 
  they can still apply for asylum in sweden though but now it is controlled . 
  thank goodness , this is going to lower the flow of migrants to finland so much . 
  the immigrant situation in sweden is neither their responsibility nor their problem . 
  in fact you are asking others to solve your problems . 
  [ kari tapio - being born in finland is a lottery win ( 1990 ) ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03qbzik2erq ), 
  that is just false . 
  the tax rate would be around 30-40 % with 70k $ income without any tax deductions . 
  the archive is pretty hard to use but there sure are good pictures . 
  reminds me of this photo ( ca n't find it in the archive but i 'm sure it 's there somewhere ) : [ finnish soldiers walking past a destroyed t34 , june 1944 ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9b/tali-ihantala.jpg ) edit : found it in the archive [ too ] ( http://sa-kuva.fi/neo?tem=webneo_image_preview_max&amp;lang=eng&amp;doc_id=7aa7d22560264217c056f6e930400d0a&amp;archive= ),

  i wish it was like this , but the fact is there 's actual rush hour traffic in helsinki region , and it sucks . 
  not as much as in some other countries , but it still sucks . 
  how ? 
  in finland you 're doing very low level government/other public institution jobs . 
  there 's nothing interesting about them unless you 've literally never held a job in your life , and they 're certainly not going to give you a lot of valuable experience . 
  sure , and it 's quite possible that they 're being intentionally ignorant how tax laws are set up ( and why there 's a good reason for a lot of it ) . 
  it 's not the guardian . 
  it 's virtually ever newspaper in europe and us with the exception of obviously heavily right leaning ones ( it does n't fit their ideology ) and business/finance papers like financial times ( because they know what they 're talking about ) . 
  i 'm getting so fucking tired of people not realizing you pay taxes on * taxable profits * , not revenue , not subscribers or anything else . 
  if you do n't know the terms nol , deferred tax liability , deferred tax asset etc are , you really should not be whining about `` mux tax fraud '' . 
  the article so is absolutely dishonest and did not even make an attempt to show * how * netflix supposedly was avoiding uk taxation . 
  they could 've tried to look in the annual report ( which is public ) if there was some shoddy internal transfer pricing going on , which seems unlikely because netflix is a service provider , not a vertically intergrated producer of physical goods . 
  but that 's not going to happen because the guardian does n't have people who know shit about accounting , finance or business . 
  but what is the point of all this ? 
  the intelligent people would go and do much more productive stuff on their own ( study/work in their field ) . 
  you realize why we have market economy instead of dictating roles for people like 1940s soviet , right ? 
  what the fuck man . 
  the people who 'd sign up for that would be on the less intelligent spectrum of the population ( and certainly have shittier education due to being 2 years behind ) - and they 'd be the only ones able to vote ? 
  talk about a race to the bottom . 
  kids are n't just some free resource to be tapped god damnit , all time you force them to do menial tasks like that , they could be getting education . 
  they will come out on the job market one year later ( assuming 1 year community service ) , which means that there 's they will have one year less of really productive working life ( much more productive than picking up trash ) . 
  additionally that productive year is taken from the very beginning of their careers , not the end , making it even worse due to the knock-on-effect of having to learn the same things as international peers one year older ( less able to adopt new info ) . 
   and yet the point of the finish army is just to delay until foriegn help comes . 
  that 's sweden . 
  the point of the finnish army is just to make it as expensive for the invading force as possible . 
  either way , if for some reason i 'd be forced to fight for eu due to my reservist status , i 'd desert . 
  i do n't think they could legally do that though . 
  not to mention if finland ever agreed to anything like this , it 'd be a small professional standing army . 
  conscription would be scrapped . 
  i see your point , but maybe military integration is not the correct first step in breaking that circle ? 
   national and societal cohesion military training where you spend time constantly with your mates and the military accomplishes some common smalltalk about the crazy , stupid or funny shit people went through among those who went . 
  i do n't think that does a lot for `` national and social cohesion ) . 
  some random voluntary work is probably going to be viewed in a * much more * negative light by those forced to participate , so it wont even really have the above going for it . 
  i 'd that 's a bullshit goal that wo n't even be achieved . 
  just go to work like normal - or study . 
   where kids have to do some sort of civil or volunteer job outside of their home state for a year . 
  complete waste of time . 
  there 's no reason for it , unlike military work which can only be provided by the government . 
  i think you fail to realize just how expensive it is to have a person use up a whole year on something like this instead of studying or working in their particular specialization . 
  in finland conscription training is actually quite valuable , though nowhere near as valuable as getting into uni one year earlier . 
  well i could 've chosen civil service , gone to jail or tried to weasel myself out by getting rejected due to medical reasons . 
  i do n't have an inherent issue with our mandatory conscription , except that it 's sexist as hell because it only applies to men . 
  the situation is wildly different than in the us . 
  i do n't think israel is interested . 
  as an eu citizen who has witnessed the ineptitude of eu - yeah no thanks . 
  as a reservist due to mandatory conscription - yeah definitely not what i signed up for . 
  we wuz kingz n shit, 
  you 're mistaking finland 's putin hate for hating russia . 
  yeah , if you actually look at the statistics , things are not that bad . 
  in fact , this kind of rhetoric could be found even before the financial crisis and such , it 's like the fucking `` darkness '' and `` bad times '' are supposed to be perpetual . 
   will usually move away from the parents at the age of 18 despite that . 
  nope , most people move after military which tends to end at 19-20 years old . 
  it 's also not too uncommon to move out even later because it might take a year or two after starting uni to get student housing ( which is affordable and quite good ) . 
  according to the finnish statistics central the median age of moving away was 21 years old in 2005 . 
  it 's probably a bit younger by now , though the economic situation might 've reversed the trend . 
  [ source ] ( http://www.stat.fi/artikkelit/2009/art_2009-03-16_004.html?s=0 ), 
  to me the words have becpme interchangeable, 
  it 's absolutely disgusting how much money some private firms are making on the refugees . 
  there 's zero bidding on these services . 
  it could be that 32 % support putin and 68 % have a negative view , giving a rating of -36 % . 
  lots of people with russian heritage and sympathies in ukraine . 
  ** the net rating is positive minus negative , while `` do n't knows '' are discarded ** . 
  that 's why you see so many ~ 0 % ratings for relatively unknown leaders because people say they do n't know . 
  so it could be -83 % negative and 17 % unsure . 
  83 % negative and 17 % positive would give a net rating of -66 % . 
  so you 're saying we can strip the rights ( or at least some rights ) of the groups i mentioned above because what they 're doing do not fit your definition of the * common good * ? 
  so people with the `` wrong thoughts '' on the correct economic policies should risk losing their rights ? 
  what about the muslim minority , which in western europe consists of over 50 % antisemites/homophobes and two thirds are fundamentalists according to studies by highly respected institutions ? 
  what about unions that support the good of their members at the expense of the common good ? 
  * common good * is a really tricky thing . 
   should someone be able to say that men or women are an abomination ? 
  why should n't you ? 
  but what if its in the common good to oppress the minority ? 
  what if we confiscated the property of some rich person because the poor have more use for it ? 
  what if we imprison opposition politicians because their speech is causing the country to divide ? 
  you ca n't sacrifice the rights of the individual by just saying `` it 's for the common good '' , or the rights lose their meaning . 
  it 's for this specific reasons why protecting the rights of the individuals is the goal , as what does society consist of if not many individuals ? 
  rights of the individual be damned , as long as it promotes the greater good ? 
  that line of thought could just as well have been used against the gays 20-40 years ago , because the vast majority were offended by them and because they are a small minority . 
  this . 
  tourists keep out . 
  because london . 
  it would be the centre of the whole union yet it does n't represent the nordics * at all * . 
  the whole way the government is ran is totally different , the government philosophy is distinctly anglo-saxon vs. scandinavian . 
  it 's of an entirely different legal family ( common law vs scandinavian ) . 
  it 's kind of a shitty angle but tampere is actually quite alright . 
  not as good as turku/helsinki though . 
  they are worried about the risk of antibiotic resistant bacteria in agri jumping over to humans . 
  jesus fuck , op really botched this one . 
  so they should instead use roaming data which can be like $ 0.20 / mb ? 
  what the heck are `` kurds and allies '' doing in aleppo ? 
  it has lost its meaning . 
  children 10 year from now will wonder what kind of terrible tweet this mussolini guy posted to get known as an infamous fascist . 
  that 's still a ridiculous number . 
  it can work just fine to have 15 % of your population with an immigration background . 
  but not if you introduce 15 % of your population as completely new immigrants from really troubled areas with really troubling cultures , over a really short time . 
  i do n't think this is healthy even if you want multiculturalism , it needs to be gradually built . 
  yeah and we do n't expect kids to have a reasonable independent opinion ( or be able to motivate it in any reasonable way ) anyhow , that 's why they 're not allowed to vote for example . 
   children  voice of the people what ? 
  you do realize why kids are n't allowed to vote , right ?

  besides , roundup is monsanto product so ofc they create a crop that `` uses '' their product and not for example berner 's herbicide . 
  however should be reminded that what russia is currently doing is not that different from what china or us are doing , biggest difference is that of the three only russians do n't give a rats ass if they happen to rock the boat or even sink it all together as long as they possess the only life jacket on board . 
  well not technically when you opposition just so happens to get conveniently murdered or jailed for tax frauds in middle of campaign . 
  you know there 's just so much violence these days . 
  technically they invaded ukraine and krim with oil money that is they oiled the pockets of army tops ranks and others well before the invasion . 
  now they just use east-ukraine to test some missile systems on passenger planes and feed enough supplies and elite troops to keep the stalemate on going since ukrainian government is unwilling to fully commit and crush the opposition in fear of russian `` intervention '' on premise of `` protecting russian civilians '' . 
  try both gulf wars which were in the beginning as conventional as they can be , characteristic is that us et al lost more soldiers during occupation then with actual fighting against saddam 's regime . 
  basically better trained and equipped us lead coalition steam rolled over a much larger army with shoddy equipment and training . 
  same thing happened with ukraine where russians knew exactly how bad was ( and still is ) the equipment , training and most of all morale in the ukrainian army . 
  point being that on this day and age numbers mean nothing unless your battle is fought as a human wave with ww i style tactics . 
  well , so would you if you 'd have a hostile nuclear superpower with as many soldiers as is the population of your country led by totalitarian ideology espousing and advocating for world dominance in our lifetime, 
  if sweden mails in their application to join nato it wont take more than a day or two for finland to send theirs and the russians know this , i think . 
  so they 're trying to keep some kind of ` equilibrium ' in their odd ` we 're not threatening you , no sir . 
  just advising ' kind of roundabout way typical to old soviet politics which putin 's regime has adopted . 
  do n't forget the constant slave raids by the russians . 
  it used to be the primary way for russian czars to pay for their cossack mercenaries . 
  yep particularly at london where it has been a problem for almost 600-700 years or so i.e since the tudors at least . 
  the other one is traffic . 
  emissions were n't regulated before the 70 's and the oil crisis . 
  that fog on those pictures btw is n't ; it 's smog that 's how polluted those cities were at the time . 
  reminded me of an old joke ; learn to recognize poisonous mushrooms and pick only those that you recognize . 
  would be worrying if there were any significant reasons to bomb anything in sweden . 
  as far as i can recall `` being a good guy '' and not just a `` good sikh '' is one of the fundamental tenets of traditional sikhism . 
  b\u00e4ttre folk is an old adage for swedish speaking finns as they in general had more wealth being a one time upper class and because they more or less looked upon ordinary finns `` along their noses '' and fought ( and still do ) tooth and nail to keep `` very important world language '' swedish alive and force fed to finns so that they would n't have to speak finnish in finland . 
  actual long term is `` svenska talande b\u00e4ttre folk '' . 
  it 's not bad as far as vodka 's go though i prefer to leave the grass for sheep and drink mine without . 
  it used to be made from a specific sausage made by a specific company in pori but that company has been gone for decades by now . 
  sausage is onion sausage with real onions not some fake shitty no actual onion sausages you gereally see in the super market . 
  that explains why the style looked very familiar and oddly clean for a russian village . 
  yep , that tiny little village in sw-finland with over 120k inhabitants, 
  that 's because frankly training for american police is rather balls in that it 's short , mostly taught by other cops on field and has an army discipline to enforce `` we vs them '' mentality and that even steven fucking seagull with an illegal boytoy in the basement can be a cop if he want 's to be a one . 
  here in finland it 's 3 years to graduate as a police officer with a university degree in law enforcement . 
  so do i. 
  they can rob me blind because there 's no law but their greed to stop them , and since its the power-grid company they can charge as much as they want and my only option is to either disconnect from grid and to use my own generator or keep suffering from being overcharged and that 's what 's making me so frustrated . 
  i 've no choice what so ever in the matter . 
  well actually there was a one of the best public transports in the world in la during the 30 's and it was deliberately ran to the ground with bribes from the car industry to sell more cars . 
  `` who framed roger rabbit '' is actually based around it . 
  it 's hardly cheap here . 
  i call it a fucking blind robbery that i pay 60-usd for the transport and only 20-usd for the actual electricity i use at my summer cottage . 
  it 's strictly needed for lighting only . 
  everything else is wood heated . 
  i very much feel like fucked in to ass without lube every month i pay my bill to caruna while the rich banksters laugh all the way to the bank . 
  got to love these word friends between finnish & estonian ... \u00fclest\u00f5usmisp\u00fchad - ulostamispyh\u00e4t , - excrement holiday though phonetically yl\u00f6stulemispyh\u00e4 is probably closer but not quite as funny sounding . 
  lihav\u00f5tted - lihavoitumispyh\u00e4t - fattening holidays munadep\u00fchad - munapyh\u00e4 - egg holiday is the only one which does n't completely change its meaning . 
  make the bow from laburnum alpinum , taxus baccata or coryllus avellana i.e just like always . 
  ash was n't the most ideal and never has been for longbow making . 
  the best is yew then elm and third is hazel nut , ash is only slightly better than scottish hornbean . 
  i think the weirdest thing is that by this rate finland is going to be the last refuge for elms , ashes and pines in europe ... 
  so far finland is the only european nation where none of these invasive insects and fungi are n't found ( yet ) , though last year there was a confirmed outbreak of blue asian borer beetles which by all estimation has now been eradicated . 
  how many species of these invasive `` destroyer bug outbreaks '' are we going to tolerate until we force the chinese to either abandon wooden shipping crates or to poison/steam the f ** k out of them and shipping containers in order to prevent this from happening ? 
  we really should take heed from what australia & z are doing . 
  dutch elm disease came form japan at the 70 's , the rest can be traced to china & east asia after 1990 's and americans got their ` pine problem ' from infected foreign live pine saplings brought from europe . 
  many people do n't know this but ash species are also crucial for the forest floor ecology . 
  ash bark & plant matter is slightly alkaline , which keeps the soil rich and from becoming acidic , and major part of what makes central european forests the way they are now . 
  terroist caught in last friday admitted he was involved in `` a terrorist attack to happen in brussels '' and my guess is that this might be it . 
  sounds like the way your average finn pronounces his school taught swedish . 
  well you know an air craft sized missile in a luggage is so easy to miss on a busy airport ... / s, 
  translation : there has been a case in tabloids in recent days where a felon convicted from a murder did n't return from his prison leave in time at the prison of kylm\u00e4koski . 
  the inmate returned ( to prison ) from his unauthorized leave on his own volition one and a half week later at wednesday evening . 
  tells something about our prison system when inmates voluntarily return on their own after they first escape it . 
  might want see the difference between a finnish or nordic prison and a romanian one and ask again ; main difference being that ours has no wall unless it 's meant for wackos , meaning anyone who cares to actually escape from their median of 3-4 years max sentence can do so even if for a few days usually until inevitably found by the police . 
  surpising amount of cars considering it 's 1936 . 
  at least ireland was easy to spot from that guinness logo and ~ ~ athens ~ ~ greece always has that funny looking owl ... 
  like so many obstacles in life the laws of economics are but an illusion held fast by the focus and belief of the one who creates it, 
   i feel like i do n't even know what the stereotypes are about austria coffee and strudels ? 
  i guess hairy like a bear with a mustaches to match means macho these days with all these clean shaven `` tit cheeks '' around . 
  i keep reading turkish y\u00fcrek as juures which means root ( vegetable ) in finnish . 
  that 's the point we do n't name the forests in finland and only rarely are they an isolated ` forest islands ' without a connection to other forests . 
  if a part of a particular forest needs a name then you name it after the nearest convenient geographical location you can name from the map otherwise it 's a forest and that 's it . 
  some flower species only exist on meadows and pastures and pastures and meadow need cows and sheep or other herbivores to stay as a meadow . 
  telling is that when dutch kids were to ask questions from other students in other countries one of them asked from finnish kids `` how many forests are there and what are their names ? '', 
  ^ umm ^ yeah ^ that ^ might ^ be ^ a ^ bit ^ tall ^ order, 
  vowel harmony is extremely regular in sense that it 's tied to which parts of the mouth form the vowel so certain combinations such as a\u00d6 a\u00c4 o\u00d6 etc. 
  for example simply can not exist or they must at atleast have double vowel or a neutral consonant near by such as \u00c4n\u00d6 an\u00c4 ( consequently that \u00d6 and a in that \u00c4n\u00d6an\u00c4 are very difficult to pronounce for a finn , however if you replace that n with m it becomes far easier to pronounce ) and so on and so on . 
  but yeah very very simple rules if you pronounce words like a finn . 
  also ulkomaalainen = foreigner also means `` outside of this world '' = maan ulkopuolinen ie . 
  a literal space alien . 
  always best to not over analyze with languages you 're not familiar with . 
  interesting how \u00c4lem of arabic ( to know ) and el\u00e4m\u00e4 of finnish ( life ) are so close both as concepts and spelling . 
  finland here using some common sense when interpreting the laws as it is any law and edict is followed to the letter no matter how silly the rule it is until the supreme court finally gives an okay to bend the rules just a little ^ but ^ only ^ in ^ that ^ one ^ case ^ and ^ that ^ only, 
  germany and austria because of beer and crazy ludvig 's play boy mansions ; those things are just outrageous i 've only been to one ( and as usual for the life of me i ca n't remember the name except that it was near munich and has a lake in the basement with swan gondolas if you can believe it ) but i would love to see the rest . 
  well kurds are the most available perfect scape goat for the general public so kurds did it , besides those mofos dare to dislike glorious turkish leader erdogan anyway . 
  edit : not that this is in anyway a new idea for example in the 70 's italian right did a series of assasinations with the help of cia of it 's own leaders and blamed it all on the leftist groups , all in the name of stopping the evil boogey man called communism . 
  personally i prefer butter over jam in my oatmeal . 
  eat as porridge , make bread from it , substitute rice with it and ofc make beer & viina from it . 
  mainly barley , rye , oat meal and wheat pretty much in this order . 
  though barley & rye tend to switch by region in breads . 
  wheat bread used to be something to eat when people wanted ` sweet pastries ' . 
  the reason being that wheat did n't grow well in finland , its too cold and soil is too acidic for pretty much anything but barley , oat and rye to be grown in notable quantity before the modern times so only rich bourgeois or land barons could afford wheat fields instead of the three more reliable cereals . 
  well those elk 's ai n't going to shoot them selves you know . 
  the usual which is frozen and a sudden thaw . 
  notice how the border at karelian isthmus does n't change at all in that map while in reality the border changed like every 50-100 years or so depending on which side was winning . 
  that 's what you get when attacking against french designed gun fortress without proper preparations . 
  `` you have been targeted for termination . '', 
  looks like someone has taken a little bit too literal in russia at the local layoff 's . 
  it is . 
  the current producer price is around 7 $ / kilo so that 's about 154 000 usd worth of nuts . 
  also eu uses 220v and that will fry your 110v rated monitors so slugging those to eu is a colossal waste of time , your tower fares better since your power usually has a switch or is rated for both 110 and 220v also the plugs are more then likely incompatible with power power sockets . 
  very much this , personally i think that even if you 're a pedophile it takes a special kind of person to actually go and act out solely on your urges and then blame the victim , your urges or anything else as long as you do n't have to admit that it was you who made the decision . 
  actually depending on sect a devout muslim is required to `` empty him self '' by hand if necessary and middle east has posts along the roads for doing just that .

  do you have any relatives who died for nothing in some shit hole ? 
  well that 's the most likely scenario 2 . but the dollar may have dark future if america keeps printing money . 
  in any case it 's a huge part of your national budget . 
  china has always been very peaceful so maybe it 's a good thing that they are the most powerful again . 
  also eu is n't interested in wars either . 
  maybe wars are a thing only for very young countries such as america ? 
  yes of course ad hominem proves you 're right . 
  eu is by far the most important trade partner for finland . 
  russia is like 5 % so they really do n't matter . 
  well when you went to iraq europe told you to fuck yourself ( quite literally ) . 
  england was the only country stupid enough to join you . 
  yes there is this one co operation contract but that gives nato absolutely no power to deploy anything in finland . 
  no i do n't live russia but i also disapprove these stupid little games of yours . 
  go to austria instead . 
  maybe they are stupid enough to join your little club . 
  also people are not stupid enough to hate an individual because of his country 's oppressive policies . 
  haha you are n't miserable with your ad hominems when someone disagrees with you ? 
  ah the sweet sweet ignorance, 
  well you have some googling to do . 
  your country has very oppressive laws . 
  and you need to attend some societies class of you think that your country has better human rights than anyone, 
  nato has no change if russia wants to take the baltics . 
  no that 's what undeveloped countries do . 
  look at china , they are smart enough to look into future and do n't care to start oil wars . 
  have you seen how much money america owes to other countries ? 
  it 's not like you can afford any wars . 
  good for the 1 % that you think that way . 
  just google `` the most powerful leader in the world ''  funny that even your own scholars recognize putin and xi  actually finnish-russian trade is nearly non-existent . 
  just look at what happened when you started your little oil war in iraq , looks like you have just one european friend and that is england . 
  no finland does n't have any binding defense agreement with anyone . 
  no that agreement does n't say `` nato can deploy '' . 
  is that what fox news told you ? 
  when you really look into this it 's the america who is aggressive not russia . 
  hmm china is propably the most powerful but they are not violent at all . 
  maybe there 's something wrong with your culture ? 
  well is n't it true that your president can incarnate you without a trial for indefinite time ? 
  also is n't it true that your police can murder you at will ? 
  sorry but i really ca n't see how your country is any better than the ussr . 
  bay of the pigs was about freedom ? 
  : dd do you really believe this shit ? 
  :d thanks for the laughs, 
  nope . 
  america went apeshit when cuba became friends with the ussr . 
  they even tried to occupy it but failed :d difference is that russia was actually successful with crimea, 
  you are delusional and ignorant about america 's position in europe . 
  america has absolutely nothing to do with defending finland and that 's a fact . 
  no i meant that us is constantly playing these geopolitical games . 
  do you really think they `` defend '' europe out of pure good will : dd finland trains with basically everybody near it 's borders . 
  so americans participating one multinational war game does n't prove anything . 
  finland has no defense agreement with anyone so you are lying . 
  america is by far the most violent country there is . 
  yep just like usa did with cuba . 
  also it 's pitiful that you do n't mention georgia at all . 
  sorry but most people hate you around here and no one thinks that your little games help anyone . 
  omg you are delusional and ignorant . 
  why did n't you post stories of every exercise finnish army does ? 
  btw as i see you are not a smart person i need to educate you on this : armies train with each other all the time . 
  conveniently you did n't mention sweden or russia at all . 
  there certainly was some provoking going on . 
  i love how you skipped georgia :d sorry to break it to you but most people are happy with no americans playing their games around here . 
  german tax payer in the other hand is very happy about you . 
  are you really sure it 's america who is in the upper hand here ? 
  i mean to me it seems like they save a huge amount of money but america gets very little back . 
  yep people of ukraine and georgia really have a reason to hate america . 
  finland is ranked as the most stable country in world by american scholars . 
  soo thanks but no thanks :d, 
  yes it 's actually a negative factor , so please go home . 
  which propaganda outlet told you that norway and estonia are `` full of american troops '' ? 
  how can you leave from some place you have never been at ? 
  i 'm pretty sure you implied that america somehow defends finland . 
  well you skipped the part where you explain how america helps to defend finland . 
  ah the good old american ignorance !, 
  you guys had better reputation pre internet for some reason :d, 
  and you are an idiot who thinks that your country is great . 
  for some reason google disagrees with you on everything . 
   she endures what is for many aging americans an unforgiving economy . 
  nearly one-third of u.s. heads of households ages 55 and older have no pension or retirement savings and a median annual income of about $ 19,000 . 
  i do n't know how one can have multiple pensions, 
  severance pay ? 
  yes that 's also law mandated, 
  well yes and that 's the reason why in other countries the governement helps people  sounds very scary to end up unemployed in your country . 
  do you mean you have four investment products that you call pension ? 
  `` net per capita financial assets '' you must be joking ? 
  in the real life americans are very poor : http://libertyblitzkrieg.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/american-middle-class1.jpg i do n't understand how you can use your vacation without taking a vacation : s, 
  i have no idea what those are . 
  are you sure about that ? 
  you have you job after like 6 months of sick leave ? 
  no it does n't . 
  not at least inside of our multinational . 
   more than half of americans , 56 % , have not taken a vacation in the last year , according to the insurance company allianz global assistance . 
   last year , the number of unused vacation days in the us reached a 40-year high . 
  for some reason google does n't agree with you on anything . 
  keep telling that to yourself, 
  sure but that 's like the last thing i would like to my tax money to go . 
  all i can say is that at least in my stem field you have better life here . 
  especially if you have children . 
  that 30 day vacation thingy is nice as far as you do n't get fired for taking them . 
  this is very common in america . 
  many people do n't take any vacation out of fear . 
  google it if you do n't believe me  ps .

  it 's a continent that hosts many countries with very divergent cultures , based on millenia of interstate warfare . 
  whoever wrote this one up in who needs a map . 
  tajikistan is not in europe . 
  it 's in asia . 
  same applies to kyrgyzstan , armenia , azerbaijan and uzbekistan .

  the lady protests far too much . 
  just how many animals has he slept with ? 
  this was long in coming . 
  islamisation and islamophilia in academia has been progressing to this point for a while now . 
  state of uk student body has been something of a mix of a horror and comedy for those of us not residing there . 
   turkey implies the turkish republic , which was founded in 1923 . 
  false statement . 
  turkey 's history includes it 's predecessor states built on the same state structures , such as ottoman empire . 
  this was clearly outlined in the premise . 
  you have to be intentionally obtuse to miss the mention of this three times in the short post , including the second sentence . 
   and key players in continuing on science when the europeans could n't even wipe their own ass ( dark ages ) dark ages were largely caused by massive invasion of militant islam onto the continent , and much of the horrors of dark ages , such as for example concept of witch burning is directly traced to books brought in by islamic scholars during the occupation . 
  when you throw off a regime that is specifically designed to improversh people to cause conversions to your militant religion as outlined in islamist dogma and people overthrow it before they convert and normalise relations , the immediate consequences are obvious . 
  but they are also localized to the immediate people , and as people regain wealth and rebuild their culture , you see the actual contents and value of their cultures and religions . 
  christianity has many problems in its dogma , but it also has several dogmaic points that make it objectively better for civilization building that islam , such as separation of church and state which eventually lead to secularism , concept utterly impossible under islamic dogma which is inherently political in nature as outlined in hadith . 
   they did have slavery , yes . 
  do many condemn it ? 
  yes . 
  you make no point . 
  ignoratio elenchi . 
  that was n't the argument . 
  you 're strawmanning . 
  the argument was that slavery done by ottoman empire was exceptionally brutal and institutionalised and codified under civil law to an unheard extent . 
  this is a favourite argument of islamist apologists . 
  `` everyone is equally bad '' . 
  this is patently false . 
  both mass murderer and family father that hides his bottle of brandy are bad . 
  extent of their vices however is vastly different , as is the need to address the issues . 
  there is a reason why once christian empires threw off the islamic yoke and started to rebuild the devastation it caused , we got reneissance , age of enlightnment , universal suffrage and other modern concepts , whereas islamic nations to this day can not even agree to premise of un declaration of human rights because it 's against their religious dogma even when offered to them in form acceptable to most other major religions and cultures in the world . 
  they literally had to have their own convention , that makes specific exceptions for methods used in sharia trumping human rights . 
  again . 
  not all religions , cultures and empires are equally bad . 
  contents and actions matter . 
  in case of ottoman history , contents were far more horrifying that those of european empires , especially when it came to institutionalized slavery . 
  that would be because they 're coast guard and not navy . 
  their resources and capabilities are quite different . 
  if you give navy free hands to blockade , their methods would be quite different . 
  you can netting over key areas to destroy the propellers on any boats , you can use drones and interceptor boats to chase down anything above water with ease and other similar methods . 
  there are several other methods . 
  none of them are easily available to coast guard . 
  all of them are available to navies of the developed countries . 
  that 's the entire point of blockading hostile territory . 
  it 's not coast guard 's job . 
  you chose to draw clear false equivalence , and then you are complaining that it was ignored . 
  it 's false equivalence . 
  why are you expecting it to get addressed ? 
  you do n't even understand that most of blockading is not about shooting . 
  it 's about not having to waste ammunition . 
  with no respect to white washers such as yourself , the premise was clear and your drawing of false equivalence fools no one other than your friends . 
  more generalist babble , that ends in a typical islamist accusation of :  so let 's end the conversation here because this is n't about history , it is about current politics and you only use history as justification . 
  translation : i have no historic arguments that are relevant in the context , i will not concede my point regardless because i 'm religiously invested in it , so i 'll accuse you of being a bigot instead . 
  standard regressive ideology at work . 
  no , i 'm dead serious , and you have gone down the standard regressive left path of drawing false equivalences . 
  the migration wave that is currently ongoing is almost purely because of the open invitation and the death toll is overwhelmingly due to the sheer amount of people trying to get in . 
  this is a unique feature that did not exist prior to this point . 
  the blood is on your hands and those that stand with you on the open border policy . 
  everyone else is innocent . 
  stop projecting your guilt on innocents . 
  i like how i called the entirety of your post 's content in my previous post , and you delivered :  cherrypick , ignore large systemic problems and talk about people rather than ideas . 
  predictable to no end . 
  we do n't need to defend our border . 
  we need to blockade theirs . 
  there 's a limited room for boat launches , and paths are fairly easy to map out with modern technology . 
  this is a problem that was solved during ww2 at the latest . 
  funnily enough , in large part by the kriegsmarine , who needed to blockade russian fleets and prevent us from resupplying russia through european routes as much as possible . 
  whining about `` embarassment '' and about 400 people dying because merkel invited everyone here in a public speech and our leadership still has no balls to cancel that invitation and make it clear that it 's pointless to take the risk because you are n't getting in regardless . 
  people that are dying in mediterranean ? 
  their blood is on your hands , and your friends , who advocate open borders , ensuring that poor masses get a massive incentive to risk their lives to get in . 
  she should have brought a small goat plushie to accentuate the point . 
  it 's not even hard to do . 
  military blockades are something we knew how to do before the modern logistics and radio . 
   i am not romanticizing anything , you are . 
  i said they were brutal and bloody but not exceptionally so , you are the one assuming that everyone else were n't somehow brutal and bloody , i am guessing especially europeans ? 
  this just shows that you have romanticized view of history but selectively so . 
  generalised platitudes again with zero specifics . 
  i provided specific points of history . 
  you provided inane general babbling , and then proceeded to shift blame to victims . 
  this is common to those that romanticise ottoman empire and islamic civilization . 
   besides `` child theft '' and forced conversions were the vast minority of the conversions but that 's irrelevant . 
  they were codified within civil law , and said children were then used as shock troops for further conquest as they grew a bit . 
  i fail to remember anyone being that brutal in europe . 
  codification of this barbarism in law over centuries is what allowed ottoman conquest to be as powerful as it was , and as exceptionally brutal as it was . 
  and eventually it broke down largely because said stolen children started to turn against them as they overextended . 
   you see , if you had an actual knowledge about ottoman history , you could make a very good argument here about individually exceptionally bloody and brutal leaders more inane babbling about individuals . 
  i 'm talking about codified civil law . 
  difference is that individuals come and go and their life spans are relatively short for biological reasons . 
  law remains far beyond life span of any given leader and demonstrate a presence of a systemic , rather than an individual issue . 
  the fact that you have to consistently attempt to derail the argument from long standing facts and large concepts such as legal structures of empire that spawned many centuries to individual leaders and events that lasted decades at most shows a remarkably shallow understanding of history , which is also consistent with being an islamic apologist . 
  cherrypick , ignore large systemic problems and talk about people rather than ideas . 
  actually , we deep freeze them . 
  one of the key demoralizing factors in winter war on the northern front was blowing up mobile kitchens , leaving soldiers without warm food . 
  finland : cooking people . 
  good to know . 
  tampere got hit really hard by mobile phone nokia 's effective dissolution . 
  i still remember doing that to a bunch of exchange students .

  i do n't want it and nothing to do with it . 
  i 'm all for free trade within the union and working freely in different european countries and living in any european country as long as you are working . 
  but this euro and the shit it has brought with it . 
  since it was introduced the prices at least here in finland sky rocketed and have never come down since then . 
  and now these idiots are talking about a federation . 
  when is europe going to realise that we can not economically or socially take as many immigrants as we do . 
  the idea is great but with uk and the likes who are closing internet faster than any other western nations in the conference it can only end as a joke . 
  ah there ... so three left . 
  damn this ship is sinking and fast . 
  who is left in the aaa in the euro . 
  germany , finland and ? 
  well it is n't such a mystery really is n't it . 
  we have been forced into a union that most people do n't want to be in . 
  we have been forced into a monetary union that most people do n't want to be in . 
  countries taking care of their finances get to pay for those who do n't . 
  immigration is reaching havoc in the uk , italy , sweden , france , spain , the netherlands . 
  muslim fundamentalist have sharia patrols on the streets of london . 
  all while more and more traditional jobs have moved to china and other low-cost nations . 
  then we have the increased americanisation of our corporations . 
  everyone is pushed to the brink for quarterly targets , we do n't work and plan long term as we used to do in europe . 
  we work our asses of doing shitty jobs that do n't produce anything except some numbers on some computer , while a manager is screaming his lungs our because you did n't reach the days kpis . 
  fifty phone calls , 300 folded napkins or whatever pointless thing it is . 
  once we leave our work to go home , we get hit in the face with a dysfunctional public transport system , or taxed-to-hell gas prices . 
  we then go to our grocery store to buy food which has seen its price sky rocket . 
  after that we cook some shitty ass dinner , sit in front of a tv getting bombarded by more ads , all while some idiot is calling you ten times to sell newspapers or underware . 
  after this we go to bed ... wake up ... go back to work ... get called fucking french , italian , english , swede by some immigrant youth at the bus stop . 
  finally at work you get the happy news that you 've got a pay chek ... you open it up and see that the government has yet again decide to take almost half of your salary to send to some idiot project in some corrupt un entity half way around the world . 
  once again back to the couch ... turn on the news . 
  stock markets crash , your house is n't worth shit anymore , your car tires just got stolen and the car put on bricks while you took a shit between the news and the tv-series you were waiting fore . 
  so yeah , people might tend to get angry , pissed of and nationalistic . 
  anyone else not the url having the following in it :  theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/nov/05/**migration-target-useless-experts ? 
  migrants yes , but as it says non-eu immigrants just cost money . 
  to quote myself :  edit : these are the basic forms . 
  * finnish : min\u00e4 * swedish : jag * danish : jeg * norwegian : jeg * russian : \u044f pronounced ya edit : these are the basic forms . 
  exactly . 
  in all countries with more than one or two parties you divide the parliament into government and opposition . 
  i 'd say the biggest problem are the french in most cases when it comes to issues that are of importance for the nordic countries . 
  but fore most i think the biggest issue is that the eu expanded to quickly . 
  but yes , i 'd not have any issues with us leaving the eu . 
  sure we could , but there would not be any point in it . 
  instead we could have free movement of people and goods with the countries we want to instead of like now just be a cash-cow for greece and others that lived beyond their means . 
  i 'd say that your comment quote essentially summarises what by many is felt being wrong in sweden at the moment . 
  every party has skeletons in their closet . 
  but when did you see a swedish newspaper write anything about extreme leftist youth ? 
  or when did you see them dig through the history of members of socialdemokraterna to the same extent . 
  i mean this is what my view is and i believe it ai n't all that far away from how others see it outside of sweden . 
  no because of the damn eu :( i buy mine every time i 'm in sweden . 
  i 'd say the main reason people in sweden do n't know about it , is because it is never reported by the news either . 
  from my experience people in quite many cases see the swedish political climate as almost scary . 
  just look how sverigedemokraterna are being harassed by media as well as other parties . 
  compared to finland where perussuomalaiset are just accepted as voted in by the people . 
  not everyone agrees with their opinions but they are still treated with respect . 
  then the whole politically correct gone ape shit thing in sweden raises eyebrows a lot . 
  in general the discussion is more open in the other nordic countries about everything . 
  whereas sweden seems to talk more about `` j\u00e4mnst\u00e4lldhet och integration '' as some kind of fundamental philosophy . 
  maybe some of the others , like vikin83 could elaborate more . 
  on the other hand finland would get back snus !, 
  lol , might be through though . 
  well time will tell . 
  although the thing speaking for it to work is that we kind off already have a union since long before . 
  but it has never been an official one . 
  apparently there is even a subreddit for it already  http://www.reddit.com/r/nordicunion, 
  i think that on this issue finland , denmark and norway are on the same page . 
  sweden unfortunately has some serious issues with its freedom of speech , press and the way they treat elected representatives that do not share the `` main '' views . 
  i 'd say a nordic union would be much better than the european union . 
  nordic countries have so much similarities both culturally , economically and politically . 
  gunnar wetterberg studied this and it would mean that the nordics would be the tenth larges economy in the world . 
  bigger than russia and brazil . 
  it would greatly improve the political power of the nordics instead of now basically being subjects to the european union . 
  it would be a front runner in technology , research and development , as the nordic states already invest a great portion of gdp in science as do nordic corporations as well by tradition . 
  do n't be so serious it was a joke mate . 
  man when they initiated nordpol for the nordic countries a few years back it made the prices even more expensive . 
  hope this works out better . 
  it is because it is an autonomous region and they wa n't to keep it very traditional . 
  to get the right to own property or land on \u00c5land you need to have lived there five years year round . 
  i think it was five , could be 4 or then 6 but anyhow . 
  hate when tourists do that . 
  once had a german couple set up tent outside our sauna at the summer house . 
  guess if i was surprised when i came walking down half naked to find these two there . 
  in this case they were nice , and apologised once i explained to them how the law works . 
  invited them to stay on my property the night and they even joined our bbq that night . 
  ended up being a nice evening but still , the initial wtf moment . 
  hell yes , welcome scotts !, 
  i 'll take you in to the gang with open arms . 
  and you 'll finally get rid of those english :p, 
  you ever been to ireland and ever heard of a figure of speech ? 
  workplace smoking should be so far from the top of important issues in ireland as humanly possible at this point . 
  your infrastructure is like in a third world country , economy is crawling , majority of the young are in part time employment or working as contractors the rest a whole 30.4 % ( eurostat august 2013 ) of youth are unemployed . 
  half of dublin is full of empty office buildings costing the irish taxpayer shit loads of cash whilst the government can not get its act together and lease them out below market price to at least cut the losses a little bit . 
  nama is however only a partial problem in the bigger picture of irish political failure . 
  even if the irish economy has marginally improved it will still take at least 10 years more for it to even get close to being back to normal . 
  during the 90s crisis in the nordic countries it took them 10-15 years to fully recover and they had their own currency to help them along . 
  the august figures show an increase of irish national debt of a whopping 39 % compared to last year . 
  yeah sure , smoking banns are very important . 
  if only ireland focused more on getting its shit together with what matters , instead of focusing on this kind of shit life would be much better . 
  source : just move back home from ireland, 
  \u017bubr\u00f3wka is the shit . 
  i love it . 
  especially on a hot summers day with some apple juice . 
  simple but awesome .

  that 's all it takes . 
  i 've been to narva several times . 
  those people do n't want to be a part of russia . 
  they 're certainly quite annoyed at estonian racism towards them , but they 're not interested in overtures from russia either . 
  heck , to most of them , russia seemed to be mostly `` that cheap place with lower quality of life from which you can get cheap groceries and fuel '' . 
  they quite liked living in estonia . 
  as a result , the fear you describe actually appears to be the main factor feeding the potential for scenario you describe to actually occur in hypothetical future . 
  frankly , clean up the racism ( which notably is n't limited to russians , or need i remind you of open racism against black us troops that recently arrived ? ), 
  and you 'll have no problem . 
  people are still people , and they still overwhelmingly prioritise having a good life over everything else . 
  in poor regions , russian pull is great because they have a higher quality of life ( think crimea , there 's a clear main reason for why people voted for russia , and it 's not cultural or ethnic ) . 
  but in baltics ? 
  not even latvia is bad enough in spite of getting slapped even on eu level for instutitional racism , and countries that have done well like estonia are very low on the risk assessment . 
  on your point on georgia , the question can be extended to russia to a far greater degree . 
  stalin carved up russian ssr and effectively gave chunks of it to other ssrs . 
  intention was that if these were to ever attempt become separatist ( from ussr ) , these chunks would hold them . 
  it 's obvious that he did n't envision a largely peaceful break-up of soviet union . 
  optimally they should have reversed most of the stalinist and destalinisation policies in relation to territorial changes within ussr upon break-up , but entire region was such a mess that no one could think beyond immediate future . 
  a good example of this is in fact crimea . 
  it 's well documented that ukrainian leadership made an offer to return crimea to russia at a time of breakup , but with all the overthrows and internal power struggle , this suggestion was never properly addressed . 
  if it was , chances are we would n't have the problems we 're having today . 
  essentially the problem is that break-up of soviet union was a mess in many places . 
  the rest of your arguments on territorial issues go beyond internal soviet issues , and typically address international warfare and conquest . 
  kurils for example are ethnically ainu , not russian or japanese . 
  japanese empire and tsarist russia took turns trading territory in military conquest over last two centuries . 
  claiming that one part has intristic right to any of those territories is not very differnt from suggesting that poland and lithuania have a legitimate claim to entire estonia , and in fact moscow . 
  why differentiate between war conquests of the past ? 
  we generally accept status quo not because it 's somehow `` more legitimate '' but because it 's simply politically easier to accept it , and because that 's what we did throughout the history . 
  if you got it and can hold it , it 's yours . 
  perhaps the biggest mistake that everyone in europe is making on all sides is thinking that war has somehow changed . 
  it really has n't . 
  you 'd think that examples of turkey/greece war over cyprus would keep people reminded that not even large military alliances can affect how war as a tool of conquest works . 
  we lost chunks of our own country in a war against russia , so i 'm not exactly neutral on the issue , but as a history buff i also recognise that `` give us back karelia '' folks are frankly ignorant of reality . 
  i also happen to remember that we were a part of tsarist russia for a long time , and it was lenin who granted us independence for the first time in our history . 
  it was a political gamble our leadership at the time to bet on lenin before he came to power , and it paid off . 
  that 's how realpolitik works . 
  you do n't get what you deserve , you get what you can actually secure for yourself . 
  a very important lesson to remember for any small country , and one that i strongly urge you as estonian to truly understand . 
  because betting on just one horse ( as you are currently doing with us ) and massively antagonising the big neighbour is rarely a successful long term strategy . 
  instead bet on both large sides , and maintain close ties with both to ensure that it 's beneficial for all parties to keep you around . 
  that is the biggest tenet of both internal and external staiblity and security . 
  on your third point , the actual agreement for russian peacekeepers was in fact ratified by all relevant parties in georgian conflict , and yes , that includes georgian leadership . 
  study the issue . 
  problem was that both sides had a tendency to shoot at each other every so often with mortars and try to buzz each other 's defences ( hence the need for peacekeepers ) . 
  this resulted in georgia annulling their part of the agreement just prior to military assault . 
  reminder : this is caucasus . 
  these are not nice people . 
  their cultures are different , but very much centered around war and violence . 
  as such , attempting to apply our values to them will result in catastrophic failures . 
  as for russia 's leadership being more popular , can i toss you a hypothesis as to why that is so that has nothing to do with invasions , or hostility ? 
  my take on it is that our leadership in the west gets more and more distant from normal people . 
  this has been worsening with the current situation in eu , where entire countries ' populations have been effectively thrown under the proverbial bus . 
  at the same time , russian leadership went for exact opposite route - both president and government routinely come for televised questioning by their own citizenry , and address even nasty concerns like specific incidents of corruption directly and head on . 
  you do n't see that in eu leadership , which likes to dodge these issues instead . 
  the difference for anyone that speaks enough languages to be able to see the difference between the two is honestly staggering . 
  i would suggest that our leadership took example from russia when it comes to actually engaging the population in highest echelons of power instead of the current `` isolated elite that talks at rather than to their constituents '' . 
  show the people that eu and its leadership can honestly meet concerns of the people face to face and takes them seriously . 
  stop talking at people and start talking to them . 
  that out to take out most of the shine out of current russian government 's ideological pull very quickly , at least for those that speak enough languages to get the unfiltered version of all relevant media outlets and are actually not intelligent enough to understand that most of it is fluff anyway . 
  on your point of `` no peaceful co-existence '' , i would simply point out that russians in general actually hammer in the necessity of it when it comes to ukraine . 
  i imagine they 'd face an open rebellion from inside if leadership there was to even imply that they could not co-exist peacefully with ukraine . 
  this for the same reason i mentioned before - blood calls to blood . 
  too many family ties across border to even contemplate it . 
  the current hysteria appears to be mostly top down on all sides , and on russian side it seems to focus more on `` ingrates '' and `` outsiders in ukraine '' rather than ukrainians themselves . 
  a rather crude propaganda as there 's a fairly significant portion of nationalists in ukraine today , but also markedly different to the equally absurd image that western mass media peddles . 
  which is also why i find comparisons to georgia et al absurd . 
  there are far fewer familial ties across borders . 
  those are genuinely different peoples with distinctly different cultures down to the very religion ( ossetians for example are majorly animist and are considered heathens in conservatively orthodox christian georgia ) . 
  well , considering that the current actions are not exactly for stronger institutions but against them through means of corruption of individuals within the system ( kohver , i 'm looking at you as a good example from estonian side ) , leaving them may certainly do some good . 
  on the other end , since it 's unlikely that other side would stop their actions which are equally corrupting , it would likely not get better either . 
  so leaving them would be bad . 
  there are no good alternatives here , but current actions are not helping the situation in any way . 
  that 's realpolitik for you . 
  big countries will always simply use smaller countries for their benefit . 
  all the smaller country can do is try to stay neutral and useful to all relevant parties , and not bow to suck one side 's proverbial dick while mooning the other . 
  that never leads to anything positive . 
  the video that was posted on liveleak shot by one of the georgian soldiers sitting on his apc as he passed through south ossentian capital as well as other evidence cited in eu report on the issue when related to events . 
  or are you disputing the ethnic cleansing part , which georgian nationalists routinely tout and which has already occurred on both sides of the border in both georgian conflicts , with both georgians and abkhasians/ossetians being largely purged from relevant territories ? 
  reminder : georgia is a part of caucasus . 
  they are also the country that gave birth to stalin and his crew and that still views stalin as one of its `` great sons '' . 
  the region known for being at least as violent and cruel as middle east . 
  these people are not nice , and their cultures are extremely violent from our point of view . 
  on all sides . 
  i love how you seem to think soldiers to be machines of war rather than people . 
  that 's quite a monstrous view . 
  you know what other countries are extremely cheap ? 
  those with similar levels of corruption and ease of armed takeovers . 
  there 's a reason why there 's no investor rush to somalia et al. 
  being cheap means nothing if you are almost guaranteed to lose your investment to local warlords if it ever gets profitable . 
  this is one thing that baltics really got right , something that most former ussr states including russia failed at . 
  building strong state institutions . 
  that is what roots out corruption and oligarchic control over economy from inside and stabilizes the society . 
  most former ussr states have weak civic society because their state institutions are weak . 
  this makes them weak to corruption and oligarchic takeover . 
  both russia and ukraine make for exellent examples of this . 
  no offense , but `` occupied territories '' in georgia , moldova , azerbaijan and so on broke away from their countries when ussr fell apart . 
  it always amazes me just how hypocritical baltic folks can be , `` yeah we should have a right to declare indepence , but the republics that are n't pro-west should be forced through violence to submit to the republic they were forcibly joined into as a part of stalinist policies '' . 
  and when it 's pro-russian ones , it 's `` fuck them with a big georgian cock '' . 
  but nagorno-karabakh ? 
  do n't give a toss .

  problems with this issue pop up here all the time . 
  yet it has nothing to do with how other states reacted and should that reaction ( or lack of it ) still effect current relationships . 
  sorry but we were talking about what happened before . 
  well if you think freedom house got it wrong you are free to present your case . 
  edit : also reporters without borders have poland ranked 18 in 2015 , 47 in 2016 and 54 in 2017 . 
  so there are even multiple sources backing my claim . 
  in a very rough 3 step grade yes . 
  obviously it does n't mean that situation is anywhere near as bad as afghanistan . 
   poland 's status declined from free to partly free due to government intolerance toward independent or critical reporting , excessive political interference in the affairs of public media , and restrictions on speech regarding polish history and identity , which have collectively contributed to increased self-censorship and polarization . 
  [ freedomhouse about press freedom in poland 2017 ] ( https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-press/2017/poland ) edit : sorry , but downvoting me does not change the opinion of freedom house on this issue , no matter how hard you hope so . 
  sometimes truth just hurts . 
   poland has been left alone by european allies , not long time ago . 
  lesson learned , pick better allies . 
  well , all i can say is i 'm glad my country got over this train of thought . 
  nobody argued what is allowed , but it does n't mean everyone should like every flavour . 
  and those labels stem from actual real life decisions . 
  yes i agree that sweden was portrayed negatively , but i think it 's not because of what sweden did , so there 's nothing for sweden to be embarrassed about . 
  it 's more about who assange is . 
  no not as such , but labels like authoritarian , nationalist undertone and populist with strong leaning on religious values can be attached to both parties . 
  but the current one is also politically closer to trump . 
  yes , because everyone knows which side macron stands . 
  i do n't see how this was embarrassing to sweden . 
  they tried to do things by the book but failed . 
  however anything short of invading a foreign embassy in a foreign country would have failed anyway . 
  as a nordic person i find it very alien that a suspect of a serious crime would be allowed to make demands for the prosecutor just because he is famous , but i guess that 's a cultural thing . 
  does your country allow suspects to dictate terms ? 
   poland and the netherlands both have a low murder rate that 's at around 0.7 per 100.000 . 
  3.25 , we win !, 
  no wait , shit ... edit : actually that 's gun related deaths , murder rate is more like 1.6 , so we still win/lose, 
  yeah it 's crazy how all [ insert demography ] think that [ insert demography ] are all the same . 
  glad we here are above it . 
  that 's totally irrelevant since we are talking about countries . 
  if a case can be made that some action is generally beneficial for companies of country x , then country x will/should try to do it . 
  if some companies of country x are against said action then it 's harder . 
  because it is harder for trump to spin any wider meaning from this for american companies since few already broke rank . 
  their motives are not that important in this regard . 
  that 's relevant ammo for eu if us administration wants to argue the case . 
   that would be some premium bullshit on googles part and i hope it is just an assumption of those companies , not something google actually tries to pull off . 
  well the important thing to understand is that it would be aimed at us administration to get them to help google . 
  that 's a pretty significant letter , it really undermines the weapons us admin could have in fighting this . 
  neither is military . 
  that 's really the only asset russia has . 
  actually f-secure is european and it is pretty secure . 
  well at this point these threads could just be titled `` told you so '' for all the people who argued it would n't happen . 
  i doubt op was arguing that ? 
   which a lot of people ** feel ** is n't what is happening this is basically one of the biggest problems for the eu . 
   and even a guy bicycling without a shirt . 
  that 's crazy , he could get sunburn on top of the obvious heat stroke . 
  actually not irrelevant . 
  the mechanism is a bit different and the speed is much slower but land rebound is effecting the landscape on longer scale . 
  yeah whenever people think of nazis they think nice and helpful . 
  why does sweden have better neighbours ? 
  actually more like the land is rising , so no . 
   problem is , they are n't even close to similar economies ( and no amount of fudging will fix that ) and so the bit that has to go with that is that when one part is suffering , because of the policies set up for the whole , then the rest have to help out the bits suffering . 
  but their economy is improving . 
  you 're presenting this as if unification is happening tomorrow , it 's not . 
   and then greece got into trouble and germany said `` fuck you '' . 
  still greece is in a situation of enforced poverty due to german action and intransigence , that they have no way out of . 
  while you can argue about the terms a fact is that greece was given money . 
  and everything was approved by imf too . 
  and the situation was not created by germans , it was created by greece . 
   ( since nothing was fixed ) yes , good that you agree with me on this one . 
  many of the proposed fixes were shot down in eu by london city and therefore uk . 
  i guess they are just  content to stick fingers in ears and hum loudly . 
   i 'd love to know what hate i 'm harboring yeah , i 'm sure it 's so ingrained in you that you do n't even see it . 
  but only in this thread you called europeans pansies , and then ( as a true patriot i 'm sure ) called a person serving your own country and you retarded and having a `` degenerate phase '' . 
  well case in point : your opening line to this thread was to call someone retarded . 
  that kind of negativity and hatred . 
  i ca n't even imagine what my life would be like if i had that much anger in me what your posts suggest . 
  i 'd say very miserable . 
  why yes i am , well done . 
  i am intrigued by you the_donald users because you seem to thrive on negativity and hatred . 
  while very rare it 's certainly not like we do n't have our share of attacks on public . 
  few school shootings and the boom at myyrmanni last decade . 
  hey everyone , a real live le_ronald specimen here in r/europe . 
  now be carefull and do n't scare it away , it might look aggressive but it just lashes out because it is confused . 
   karelia meh , we 're content with western karelia , if someone wants to fund eastern parts to catch up to 21st century then go ahead . 
  i do n't think those kind of mass firings are everyday occurrences in russia ( or even in turkey ) . 
  they sure as hell are not in eu . 
   eu forces spending much is not because they are training well or taking active role , but rather they are having modern facilities for their soldiers , providing more salaries and such , which does not have much role in an active combat with russia . 
  i 'll just leave [ this ] ( http://tass.com/defense/885430 ) here ... tldr ; russia kicked some of its top military command out because of the `` non-problems '' mentioned by op , also combat training was an issue . 
  turns out you do need money . 
  yeah and further north places like kaaresuvanto ( which is only a village mind you ) has even the same name both sides of the border . 
  as opposed to 4chan ? 
  interesting ... 
  as are gays in russian culture . 
  should we draw some conclusions from that too ? 
   i do n't believe in the holy free west anymore , where everyone is rich and everything is working right , it 's literally the same shit as russia when it comes to approaches and government-people relationships . 
  it 's the same propaganda in media and us vs them mentality . 
  this image of holy west is the construct of your own imagination , do n't blame us if you were disappointed because of your own fantasies . 
  also saying the west is same as russia in any extent is just as delusional . 
  maybe next time you do an ideological 180 try to stop before you end up at the other extreme of spectrum again , truth is usually somewhere in between . 
  `` jewish republic of turkey '' oh my ... 
  this is where i disagree : being a minister is a political position , not an expert position . 
  maybe apart for minister of justice i see no reason why ministers should be a specialist on his/her field . 
  it helps but it should not be a requirement . 
  that 's why there are actual experts employed by the state . 
  honestly i was not expecting them to last this long . 
  it 's pretty obvious this is not what timo soini had in mind when he formed the party in the 90 's , but instead of actually doing something about it and following through with his talks 10 + years ago he was more interested in getting the votes these hard liners brought for the party . 
  ( * tinfoil hat on * ) this was always plan b for soini if terho lost the election for chairmanship .

  poor companies , so sad no-one told them that investing to russia may have risks . 
   millions of people from the countryside and the small cities will move to western european countries to work on low-level jobs . 
  people leaving the countryside and small towns for jobs either in cities or other countries has happened all over the world and also in european countries at different times . 
  here in finland it happened quite late compared to other industrialized countries and in the 60s and 70s hundreds of thousands were leaving the countryside for industrial jobs in sweden . 
  by leaving they got better wages and better standard of living in sweden as they could have in finland . 
  in post-soviet countries it is happening later . 
  and there 's also another important aspect to it : the soviet collectivized agriculture was labour heavy . 
  as the agriculture gets modernized it can produce more with less labour , and there is less demand for low-skilled labour in the countryside . 
  for them the choises are either education for new qualifications or to continue to work in low-skill jobs . 
  it just so happens that even the low-skill jobs pay comparatively well in the west , and it is a lucrative way to improve one 's standard of living instead of for example getting new qualifications and moving to city . 
  it has both negative and positive impacts , but i can not see it as such a tragedy as some like portray it . 
  what you gon na do about it anyway ? 
  introduce internal passports to prevent people from leaving their village and force them live in it in misery ? 
   however , even if they joined the european union , it 's unlikely the average ukrainian will get the european living standards this century . 
  wow , not for 86 years you say . 
  sounds a bit bold prophecy if you ask me . 
   for more details , ask the bottom half of the romanian employees , who earn less than 200 $ / month . 
  how about cheking also [ other countries ] ( http://i.imgur.com/np53wac.jpg ) . 
  then analysing a bit what you have gathered , and possibly seeing what to do to best foster growth . 
  i mean , even reaching romania would be a big improvement . 
  you can easily study in english . 
  but finding work in finland after that will be challenge if you have n't learned any finnish - but that depends a bit . 
  for example , especially in the ict sector there are companies that work in english and do not require finnish skills . 
  additionally , as i presume you have language skills in ukrainian , russian and english they may be strong points in your resume for some companies working in the relevant regions . 
  in general you 'll need finnish skills and not having it will make finding a job harder . 
  but it is not always absolutely necessary . 
  yeah , i did n't expect either . 
  i actually believed putin when he said that he will not invade ukraine , and then that he will not annex crimea . 
  despite him lying about pretty much everything else i honestly believed him on those two points because invading and annexing just did not make sense - and honestly still does n't . 
  will bite him into ass hard later on . 
   i do n't share the values of us government well , then you do n't . 
  look , i find following two arguments regarding finland 's nato membership pretty silly : 1 ) whether russia is or is not about to annex finland . 
  2 ) something something us . 
  neither of them has never convinced me to support nato membership , and neither will convince me out of it either . 
   we are in eu , indeed . 
  finland is not neutral any more , and staying militarily non-aligned looks a bit contradictory to me . 
   we do n't need to be in some military alliance to show that we share democratic values . 
  and yet you said that you would support finland joining a military alliance . 
  the big difference is that while you 'd support finland joining an alliance that exists only in imagination , i support finland joining an actually existing defence alliance . 
  social democrats was important in the containment policy towards communists who got their funding from kremlin . 
  us funding had nothing to do with a nato membership , which would have been impossible due to treaties anyway ( paris peace treaties , yya ) . 
   finland should n't join . 
  russia has no reason to annex finland i have been on the fence on nato membership for a very long time . 
  now i support it . 
  the potential of a russian annexation has not played part in it , and i find that somewhat lacking as an argument in the first place - both for , and against nato membership . 
  i support nato membership because finland is not a neutral country , have n't been for decades , and it is silly to try turn clock back to times of finlandization by longing after pretended neutrality . 
  as a western democracy and as a member of the eu finland is clearly aligned with the west sharing its values . 
   i would prefer military union with other nordic countries . 
  there will be no military union with other nordics . 
  iceland , denmark and norway are all already in nato , and they 're not about to leave it . 
  that leaves potentially only sweden . 
  there 's no plans or initiatives for a military alliance between sweden and finland . 
  there are only some plans for military co-operation , but that is far from a defensive alliance . 
  and as alliances go it would make much more sense to simply join nato as 1 ) it actually exists and 2 ) has actual military power as compared to any imaginable nordic alliance . 
  and just when you 'd think russian propaganda could n't get any more ridiculous they take it to new hilarious levels : [ 27 sailors resign from the uss donald cook - the american destroyer stationed in the black sea ] ( http://www.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;ie=utf8&amp;sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fsevastopol.su%2fworld.php%3fid%3d60334 ) * the pentagon acknowledged that imitation su-24 attack on the u.s. navy destroyer produced a demoralizing effect on the crew * btw , for added fun check the domain name .

  in finland : http://www.studyinfinland.fi/tuition_and_scholarships/tuition_fees  the tuition fee trial period in finland 2010-2014 is drawing towards its close ( see subsection ` tuition fee trial period 2010-2014 ' for more information on this ) . 
   this means that there are no tuition fees charged in finnish higher education degrees starting in autumn 2014 , regardless of the level of studies and the nationality of the student . 
   but please note that this does not completely rule out the possibility that the situation might change at some point in the future .

  the osce has an observation mission in the region . 
  i do n't know what they have reported . 
  many thanks to you both . 
  in the 90s i used to work on harju street right opposite the park in # 50 , # 51 and # 52 . 
  in fact the park was where i first learned about the march bombing . 
   the fact that the us has it 's mercs there . 
  i 've seen only rumours and unsusbtantiated kremlin claims , would approach with a big grain of salt . 
  thanks to you both . 
  fixed the link . 
  another striking detail is that both guys have a rifle * and * a pistol ( see the holster on his right thigh ) . 
  i do n't know why ` concerned citizens ' would so consistently wield them both . 
  does not mean it 's the same guy in both images , but points to russian spec ops . 
  having both rifle and pistol is standard issue of russian spec ops . 
  they 're trained to wielding them both as their doctrine is that a soldier must never be unarmed or with an unloaded gun . 
  they 're also trained to switch between them on the fly depending on the situation . 
  check this training video of russian spec ops guy switching between his rifle and pistol : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1fy8lblblq&amp;t=1m42s we have seen it before in crimea with russian troops , and now we 're seeing it in eastern ukraine . 
  here 's a ` concerned citizen ' in eastern ukraine today making a convincing point with [ his pistol ] ( https://pbs.twimg.com/media/blfvrdeigae-we6.jpg ), 
   i 'm personally hoping for a eu military in the future since i can see sweden and finland joining that . 
  the de facto defence alliance in the eu is nato . 
  in the 90s there was some attempts of forming another eu defence alliance based on weu or such ( and i do n't mean military co-operation in general , but defence alliance ) . 
  but it became obvious how redundant that would be . 
  if you 're still hoping for one , you 'll probably have to wait a long time . 
  speaking of historical images , does anyone have links to images of tallinn before the soviet [ march bombing ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bombing_of_tallinn_in_world_war_ii ) and after ? 
   bb guns do n't kill 16 police mens in body armor with helmets and stuff indeed . 
  and as the protesters did n't have sniper rifles and aks it rises some questions , do n't you think ? 
   there is other footage with a guy with curly hair who shoots at someone before any slaughter of civilians taking place . 
  yeah , i 'm sure that settles it then . 
  by the authority of youtube it was ' a guy with curly hair ' . 
   again , `` old ladies '' are a part of propaganda campaign conducted by russian oriented side to present themselves as defenders of oppressed . 
  maidan activists used pr shit and media campaigns as well , yet no one accused them of being `` brave , brave , brave '' . 
  putin using civilians as human shields is what he 's rationalising . 
  he 's a very brave man . 
   unlike western `` interventions '' that strive only to bring freedom and prosperity to the world . 
  did n't know of whataboutism in sweden . 
  thanks for demonstrating .

  combination of maniac neighbours , faulty currency and evolution of internet eating into paper manufacturing ... not really eu 's fault , but we could have done a far more flexible response locally . 
  if you see that map , only germans are happy . 
  the rest is in the tank . 
  euro too strong , russian sanctions , traditional industries transforming and couple really idiotic eu policies ( like sulphur tax on shipping ) .

  oversimplification on many levels . 
  finland is trouble due to paper consumption falling and the pulp getting replaced by cheaper production methods , main trading partner getting sanctioned , overvalued euro ( or rigid currency ) , various insane eu policies ( sulfur tax for every export going to eruope ) , and so on ... 4 am , might write morre tomorrow , but ** blaming this on fall of nokia is horse shit . 
  that intervention you quoting was a land grab , not real help . 
  finland had a deep water port in the far north so you could just sail to finland ... 
  the french started loading an infantry brigade ( based in belley ) to send to finland . 
  stalin wanted to avoid fighting the west , so the invasion was stopped . 
  read henrik tala ( 2012 ) https://helda.helsinki.fi/handle/10138/33185 stalin 's offer has been a bit of mystery , since the finnish army was almost out of ammo and men while the russians were not involved in any other wars . 
  so basically stalin just backed off and left finland for no other reason than massive casualties . 
  fully noted . 
  also see the franco intervention that actually took place , without the british pussyfooting . 
  britain = thanks for nothing .

  as for f35 ...

  the next greek-turkish war . 
  they already fought one out while both being in nato . 
  turks run well over 1000 airspace violations a year , at times over 1000 per month when it comes to greece . 
  remember , greece and turkey are antagonists who fought a war while both being in nato . 
  and on the other side of the religious fence , not allowing abortion is incompatible with human rights . 
  let 's be fair . 
  which european countries actually wanted to hold the refugees and not pass them on whenever possible ? 
  that list is awfully short , at zero countries . 
  no one wants these people . 
  even swedes are now saying their country is full , after the initial `` refugees welcome '' attitude . 
  this is going to get worse , because russia keeps getting massive inflow of afghans and syrians constantly . 
  did you read the statement , or did you just knee-jerk based on your prejudices ? 
  because my statement makes it very clear to anyone who is n't overreacting and stopping reading after the first sentence that there were multiple factors . 
  and no , it was n't genocide , unless you 're ultranationalist ukrainian with an axe to grind or their supporter . 
  if you need to look for actions of stalin that meet many criteria of genocide , you do n't need to look far . 
  there were quite a few . 
  the fact that you choose to intentionally ignore the deaths of russians , kazakhs and modovans all from the same event shows that you do indeed have an axe to grind here . 
  reminder : stalin peacetime policies caused more deaths in ussr than that country lost in ww2 . 
  and they played a part in this particular event , but crop failure was still the main cause that triggered the deaths . 
  everything else merely exacerbated the numbers . 
  to call something `` genocide '' , you need the actions to be the main cause and people the specific target of elimination , rather than merely items that aimed for a completely separate goal that worsened the outcome . 
  for example , you would be much closer to reality if you called the people forced to work on actual electrification of ussr genocide , as many of those died horrible deaths directly as a cause of it . 
  yet it still largely does n't meet the requirements because the aim was n't to actually kill those people , but to uplift an post civil war agrarian society to industrial age as soon as possible to stay competitive . 
  and it 's not like stalin was playing favourites . 
  most of his victims were russians , not ukrainians . 
  his own people , georgians also took a significant hit . 
  and he did n't even treat his own son in any special way . 
  he was just as disposable to stalin as anyone else . 
  overall in many events that were in part caused by stalin 's policies deaths were just a part of the fact that stalin 's policies simply viewed people as disposable , and as a result many actions taken were taken without regard to dangers they posed to workers . 
  shall we continue on the `` axe to grind '' portion , considering the original poster , or shall we agree that propagandist wankers do n't deserve to be listened to ? 
  or you could simply read the literature available on the topic in countries that do n't have an axe to grind on the issue . 
  english wikipedia sources offer plenty of suggestions on where to start . 
  it was a massive crop failure combined with massive problems due to lack of knowledge of the new grains being introduced , that was prevalent across the region . 
  crops that did n't fail often either rotted in the fields or just were n't harvested due to lack of know-how . 
  no idea where you pulled your claim from . 
  points to consider : you are far more likely to get killed by a random object falling from a building while walking down the street , or dying to a car hitting you than terrorism . 
  do you feel this kind of fear about getting out to the street ? 
  why ? 
  it 's far more dangerous in comparison . 
  tickets will likely be cheaper now that people have neuroses about these things . 
  use the opportunity . 
  rather suprised at the angle of the story . 
  i thought pretty much everyone who wanted to be informed about ttp and ttip understood that main parties were multinationals against states , not states against one another . 
  they should name him `` gas '' . 
  fitting , and would have a sense of humour to it . 
  it 's the modern consumerism . 
  traditionally decorations did n't come out until late december . 
  but got ta get those sales in . 
  it also hit three nationalities , not one . 
  russians , ukrainians and kazakhs were all hit . 
  to a smaller degree , moldova also got impacted . 
  ukrainian ultranationalists like to pretend many things , one of them being that holodomor just impacted them and was a creation of russians , rather than a massive crop failure that hit all nationalities in the region involved . 
  at the same time stalin 's komissariat had to meet a quota of selling grain to foreign clients to raise hard currency for national projects such as electrification of ussr , so they started squeezing peasants of the `` bread basket region '' , that being eastern ukraine , southern russia and western kazakhstan . 
  which were the regions where most of the holodomor deaths occurred . 
  hence the deaths . 
  severing data links in the area is actually fairly easy for military . 
  you just use jammers mounted on helicopters or aircraft that loiter in the area . 
  civilian grade infrastructure does not have the ability to withstand it . 
  problem is that side effects of this kind of action are quite severe . 
  personnel on the ground will suffer from this kind of jamming , as will obviously civilians that need the information infrastructure . 
  it 's an issue of a cure being worse than disease . 
  anything less , and you 're not really accomplishing much , because reasonably well funded and equipped terrorist cell like one that hit paris will likely have their own radios and you can get a satellite phone/datalink hardware quite easily nowadays . 
  those will remain unaffected by termination of local services . 
  perpetrator with means to counter the raid or avoid it if he was given exact , live information on status of the raid . 
  i 'm nowhere near the optimism you have in terms of science advancement , mainly because i see that while the speed with which we increase gaining amount of new knowledge continues to go up , our ability to actually apply this knowledge is stagnating , due to limitations mentioned above . 
  we have all but exhausted the low hanging fruit in most relevant fields , and often even the one on the middle levels of the tree . 
  the advancement is no longer about making leaps . 
  it 's about massive investment to squeeze a couple extra percentage points . 
  advancement that would be required for your dream would need those leaps , and a lot of them . 
  we 're barely making any any more . 
   the main point was that in the long term nothing says we need factory work outside of history . 
  mr. trump just got elected and one of the biggest reasons was specifically because there is n't enough factory work to keep large amount of people occupied and hopeful for their lives . 
  this is a sociological element linked to our development as species . 
  we need something for people to do , and overwhelming majority of people lack the faculties to become top level specialists required for the style of economy you envisage ( also see # 3 above ) . 
  that means factory style work is needed . 
  and as that declines , science progress itself becomes endangered , because there 's less attention on advancing it , and more attention on desperately keeping the lid on the most destructive force known to man - large amount of people with no hope in their life . 
  his legacy held for almost three quarters of a century , but even he was unable to strip islamism of its power in modern turkey . 
  would be pretty hard to make a dick move with it being glued to the door and all . 
  if you do not have intelligence to decipher `` many words '' , perhaps you should not be discussing complex issues that require them ? 
  he did n't do it to any significant degree . 
  stalin 's issue was building a state . 
  as a result , he was n't targeting people for extermination . 
  he was just targeting any dissidents for slave labour needed to build cities in the great wilderness of ussr . 
  you could survive it and come back . 
  it was hard , but many did in fact survive it and come back . 
  on the other hand , you do n't come back from actual targeted ethnic cleansing . 
  you do n't have to ask jews or roma under hitler . 
  you can ask muslim men in srebrenica . 
  that is what ethnic cleansing looks like . 
  stalin was very egalitarian and meritocratic in how he dispensed death and suffering . 
  that 's why you wo n't be able to find an ethnic group in soviet union at the time that did n't suffer from his repressions . 
  if you opposed him , you got more repression . 
  if you did n't you got less ( but still quite a bit ) . 
  you had to do just one thing to contribute to modern world . 
  just one thing !, 
  and you nailed so many wrong people and still missed the target . 
  seriously , that 's a new level of incompetence . 
  skynet will no longer be buying your services . 
  isis massacring innocent christians and destroying `` pagan '' holy sites , etc , is all heretical according to mainstream interpretations and traditions .

  i guess your approach is worse in the way that the occupation can be permanent ( and also damaging ) . 
  us inflict much more damage in short term but the duration is shorter and you at least end up with a free country . 
  because they like to troll . 
  post-brexit there has been a pretty big increase of leave-voting brits on r/europe . 
  i think pre-brexit they used to quietly discuss amongst themselves on r/ukpolitics, 
  how so ? 
  i dont think they believe they `` own '' any other country but they do feel they have a right to bomb and fuck with any country they wish . 
  those 2 are different things . 
  the russians take over countries , the us just puts countries in ruin to the extent they wouldnt want to take them over . 
  i think there 's a shortage of bar staff in the us , so maybe in that capacity he would be welcome . 
  do you mean because of trump ? 
  or what ? 
  agree she never looks happy but at least she takes things seriously , unlike people like trump and theresa may who have nothing to offer but soundbites . 
  will this make any difference ? 
  i doubt the guy will ever leave a french prison in his lifetime anyway ? 
  yea , how self absorbed do you have to be to think that someone is punishing you when they dont put your needs above their own . 
  i 'm getting bored of this conversation . 
  you are not saying much except repeating that the uk gets a good deal because of their importance . 
  but everything suggests otherwise and the uk is n't quite as important as you think anyway . 
  certainly not more so than 27 countries combined , particularly with a few larger and even richer countries within that 27 countries . 
  they are being seen as costs by the uk , not others . 
  this is evident by the fact they opted out of these . 
  others consider things such as schengen a benefit . 
  true , non-eu countries have different deals , but not one has one where they get everything they want , with no costs or disadvantages involved . 
  i dont think the uk will get anything special , they can get a canada type deal , or a norway type deal . 
  the evidence is in this article . 
  repeating something wo n't make it come true . 
  the swiss tried and it didnt work out and are backtracking on taking away freedom of movement . 
  they do have a slightly different deal but its taken decades to get the agreements in ( which uk doesnt have time for ) , but when they tried with freedom of movement it didnt work . 
  true but like i said , he 's thought to be not that he definitely is . 
  many estonian , finnish and russian papers have reported on it . 
  yet look very different . . 
  all of the `` benefits '' you list are ones not seen as advantages by the uk , and had opt outs for it even while in the eu . 
  you get to pick and choose if you are in the eu , and the uk certainly did pick and choose more so than any other country . 
  it 's just that you dont get the luxury of cherry picking when you are not a member . 
  the uk can seek any kind of deal they want , it doesnt mean they 'll get it . 
  true but uk is the only one , not the other major countries like germany and france, 
  so what if they are , there are other existing countries within the eu for help . 
  not just the uk ? 
  if you refer to military support , you should be talking about nato not eu . 
  unless uk plans to leave that too . 
  if you refer to military support , then you should be talking about nato not eu , unless uk is planning to pull out of that too, 
  the eu would disintegrate if the uk got what its asking for , which is all benefits of eu membership , but no payment or requirement to follow rules . 
  even the biggest supporter of the eu would prefer that !, 
  it 's just that nobody else is silly enough to expect to get it because the rules and payment is necessary and reasonable . 
  the eu is more than just eastern europe, 
  how is the eu trying to prevent the uk trading freely ? 
  the eu arent the ones pushing the uk out of the eu, 
  i guess finland is the verbal kint of countries . 
  agree - so delusional i 'm unsure if some of the comments are trolling or for real, 
  unsure if you 're trolling or for real . . having colonised half the world and those countries acrimoniously fighting and gaining their independence may be `` strong ties '' but i wouldnt say its necessarily in a positive sense . 
  russia doesnt `` like '' the uk , they like that the uk voted leave and weakened the eu by losing a member , potentially improving russia 's position in the world , against the uk as well . 
  i 'm sure putin is as flabbergasted by it as the rest of the world , but happy this fell on his lap . 
  the eu is one of the superpowers that you speak of , its more like the uk is caught between multiple superpowers . 
  any international power the uk has since the fall of the british empire is because they have been perceived as a gateway to the eu , which will soon no longer be the case . 
  the eu will be fine without the uk . 
  the question is will the uk be fine without the eu . 
  that 's not true . 
  it 's not that the eu want to punish the uk , its that the uk want to have their cake and eat it too and anything less than that the uk considers punishment . 
  financial services are something that can easily be done in eu countries . 
  when passporting rights are severed in the uk , a lot of this business moves to the eu . 
  financial services are not a right of the uk that the eu needs access to , the eu membership itself allows the uk to maintain certain financial services activities . 
  bilateral ties are important to all , but they are more important to the uk than any other eu country . 
  the uk exports more to the eu than any eu individual country does to the uk so its much less important to any individual eu country than it is to the uk . 
  sure security cooperation would be appreciated , but if the uk refuses to cooperate in this capacity , i think the eu will be stronger with the 27 countries than uk on its own, 
  yea its annoying they keep calling it punishment . 
  they dont want to maintain membership of the club , they not get access to it . 
  that 's not punishment , its just their chosen course of action . 
  nigel farage 's major claim about getting a good deal for the uk was that german car manufacturers would want to keep markets with uk open and would lobby it to no end . . but it turns out , german car manufacturers benefit more from the eu existing than their access to the uk . 
  so while i can see your point , people have more to lose with giving the uk a good deal that potentially leads to the disintegration of the eu itself than what they gain through giving uk a good deal, 
   they 'll try to emphasise that it 's better if the eu does n't screw over the uk to much if they still want support you sure that the 27 countries of the eu will come knocking on the uk 's door for support and not vice versa ? 
  this is a canadian website , which seems to know very little about europe . 
  there are many countries , incl , finland that have shown record lows since 2011 for support to these eurosceptic / anti immigrant parties . 
  the `` finnish '' version would more likely be putinen, 
  he already changed it to a fence along * some * parts of the border , i believe . 
  noble and very important cause but a bit naive to think this has any chance , particularly with the new us president elect thinking climate change is a hoax . 
  fun fact : putin is thought to be of finno-ugric ( specifically finnic ) ancestry but ( some ) russians find this claim offensive https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/finno-ugric_peoples#finno-ugric_identity, 
  you 're right its railway tunnel but is much longer than 25 km , it would be the longest tunnel in the world https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/helsinki_to_tallinn_tunnel i thought i had read that this tunnel was already approved and going ahead but does n't look like it, 
  also when the new tunnel between tallinn and helsinki is built , the waiting time becomes zero . 
  no i think it means that pm needs to decide what the new legislation should be before parliament votes on it . 
  so instead of voting on `` can we change the law , but unsure yet what we will change it to '' its `` can we change the law to this specifically '', 
   i do not have the sense that european politicians will not now seek `` revenge '' on the uk for wanting to leave us nobody wants revenge . 
  its just that the uk considers revenge to be them not maintaining all benefits of eu memberships when they leave the union and so will call it that . 
  this proposal is ridiculous , why should uk citizens get the benefits of eu membership without the uk government having to deal with any of the responsibilities . 
  i doubt it . 
  the uk has always been the most eurosceptic , i dont think brexit is any indication other countries will follow suit . 
  i dont think brexit is going or will go well either ( or at least thats the perception in my opinion , from it not having happened yet ) which i think is off-putting to people, 
  i dont think the euro has ever been backed by us dollars ? 
  well it is what she went to court for . 
  she 's not trying to overturn brexit , she ca n't and she knows that , she was just justifiably very concerned about how brexit was being handled and wanted oversight from some people who actually know what they are doing . 
  it must 've been worrying also that the government was prepared to break laws to get their way , though it doesnt appear that too many people apart from her realised this, 
  she 's not trying to subvert anything . 
  all she 's trying to do is make sure the government abides by the law !, 
  also , challenge the government and we ca n't help you ? 
  while i agree with everything you said , you do realise that your own country recently voted for their own permanent trump in the form of brexit ? 
  and in the case of the uk , the majority actually did vote for it unlike with us election ? 
  and in a way its worse because they voted in spite of the economy , whereas short term trump may not be that bad for the economy ( not to suggest that any short term economic gains are worth the bad ) . 
  my point is n't to bash the uk over brexit , but one of the problems with this wave of populism sweeping the western world is that people seem confident in pointing the finger at other countries but when it comes to their own , they vote for their own brexit / trump / le pen and say its different or ok because of x , y or z. thats part of the problem !, 
  they kind of have though - vote for wilders or le pen would 've been anti-eu, 
  i wouldnt go study in the uk even if i was non-eu , given the anti-immigrant rhetoric coming from uk which is likely aimed at all , not only eu immigrants .

  seriously it 's annoying how every now and then i encounter someone who begins to lecture me about my culture and how i 'm related to some people i have never heard of . 
  it feels obnoxious and chauvinistic . 
   there has also been genetic analysis that follows up these cultural categories ( haplotype maps ) and you can see they have the same conclusion ( lower r1a and r1b haplotypes ) one of my friends is a person of vietnamese origin who was born and raised here in finland . 
  i guess he has nothing in common with me in terms of culture ? 
   i think you 'd have a hard time anybody who thought of finnish people as lesser people . 
  when i was in germany i encountered a group swedes who immediately began to rant how i do n't belong to there because i 'm not germanic or some shit like that after they had heard where i was from . 
  they stopped after my german friends told them to shut up . 
  edit : i 'm sorry , it 's getting late here and i 'm getting sleepy . 
  as i said it 's tiresome to hear the same memes about my culture over and over again , so i just felt like ranting . 
  my apologies . 
  yes , and some ( silly ) people also blame the eu for our problems with russia . 
   the us seems unlikely to sign a lone finland-us agreement to publicly guarantee defense of finland . 
  the article was about increasing cooperation and said nothing about security guarantees , and the cooperation between us and finland seems already to be somewhat extensive considering that us has allowed finland to buy advanced weapons like jassm and f-18 and the f-35 is a candidate for our next fighter . 
   because they are finnic i have heard people calling us `` finnic '' before but what does that even mean ? 
  if you are implying that we some kind of subhuman mongoloids then you are wrong . 
  [ please do n't come we are homos .

  actually we do n't have that many russians here . 
  and around 60 % of our trade is with eu countries . 
  the amount will slightly decrease after the uk leaves but still a majority of our trade will be with the eu countries .

  that may have been true like 50 years ago or something , but that 's no longer the case : swedish is an irrelevant language for vast majority of finns , and these days we are influenced by germany and usa at least as much as we are influenced by sweden . 
  we also have a maritime cluster , health tech industry and various other industries ( like chemicals and various machinery ) . 
  nokia is also still around and entrepreneurship is starting to take off .

  are there actually any meaningful links between the commonwealth countries ?

  you are mostly right , however finland has also received influences from directly from germany and other european countries for centuries . 
  for example there were finns studying in germany back in 15th century and we imported national romanticism from germany . 
  could you please tell them that we need some good architecture here ?

  [ from wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/okkupert )  the eu , in desperation , asks russia to initiate a velvet glove invasion of norway .

  i do n't know anything about those countries , but i suppose the eeu could have some appeal to isolated post-soviet central asian countries . 
  however russia does n't seem to be the primary trading partner for either country : [ tajikistan ] ( http://atlas.media.mit.edu/en/profile/country/tjk/ ) and [ uzbekistan ] ( http://atlas.media.mit.edu/en/profile/country/uzb/ ), 
  are there actually any potential new members ? 
  honestly i do n't see why anyone in europe would want to join . 
  the eu is the world 's second largest economy so i do n't see what the eurasian union could offer . 
  nokia had manufacturing and r&d operations around the world like every other truly global company , but they still employed lots of people here in finland , which why especially salo , oulu and tampere have been hit so badly . 
  did you read the article ? 
  nokia accounted for 4 % of our gdp and 21 % of our total exports , and more importantly nokia accounted for lion 's share of our high technology exports , and high technology products are the kind of advanced high value added goods that a developed 1st world country is supposed to produce ( instead of third world level goods like paper ) . 
  furthermore nokia was our only really strong global consumer brand . 
  most of our exports are investments goods ( elevators and various machinery for example ) and while there is nothing wrong about making investment goods it 's also important to have consumer goods because if the demand for investment goods drops due to lack of investments in the world you would have at least something to sell . 
  if the old nokia was still around it would be far easier for us to handle our current economic problems . 
   that was innovative , but also targeted at an audience that would never sustain nokia . 
  i was under impression that it sold reasonably well ( at least when compared to lumias ) despite the fact it was n't launched in the us or in the larger european countries . 
  of course it is entirely possible that it was too little too late . 
  true , but the consumer market is also potentially much larger and losing it was a catastrophic failure no matter how one looks at it . 
  however as i said nokia has done very good job at turning things around since then . 
  i think that is possible , there are some good things happening in our economy for example entrepreneurship is starting to takeoff and certain sectors are doing ok ( like maritime cluster and health tech ) and the strong urbanization trend should help as well . 
  however finland 's economy is still very fragile and is vulnerable to external shocks , for example we would be in serious trouble if china were to crash . 
  no not really , the phone business was far larger than the network business so nokia is still a shadow of its former self . 
  however nokia has done great job during the last few years so it 's entirely possible that nokia may do a comeback . 
  well the good news is that nokia left behind a trained workforce and other benefits , so it should be possible for us to diversify our economy and to a certain extend this is already happening .

  you are going to disengage with a very high percentage of your subscribers .

  ( after a glance at the sub , it looks like this is happening already . ),

  there is even a finnish cryptocurrency which offers a [ basic income ] ( http://fimk.fi/en/faq.html ) to finns . 
  the trade unions and social democrats do n't like basic income because they think all such benefits should be work-based . 
  ( and maybe they are trying to protect their power base . ), 
  at the moment it is more of a compelling idea which should be studied and considered ( like the pilot program you linked to ) instead of any real push for it to be implemented any time soon .

  that is a pretty big range . 
  although that was in the 1990s and perhaps we have better methodology today . 
  another relevant question is who estimated 1.4 million people . 
  it is pretty tough to get an accurate picture of a huge crowd of people , and such estimates are ripe for abuse .

   in an open letter to his diocese , bishop thomas tobin of providence , r.i. , wrote : `` ... the church risks the danger of losing its courageous , countercultural , prophetic voice , one that the world needs to hear .

  in finland one of the most vocal parties in regards to immigration is the finns . 
  they have published a [ handy guide in english ] ( https://www.perussuomalaiset.fi/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/ps_immigration_final.pdf ) if you are interested . 
  the tl ; dr version is that they want to limit immigration , but that probably is n't a news flash .

  ah , the continuation war ... 
  ever since independence and before there has been a `` karelian question '' in finnish politics . 
  in more modern times it has gone away as a result of russification of karelia and the strength of the soviet union but in the early part of the 20th century it was an important question . 
  let me try to explain the importance of karelia for finland . 
  culturally karelia was seen in some national romantic ways as one of the few regions where true finnish and karelian culture exists but then being threathened and oppressed by russians and bolshevism . 
  unfortunately under putin this russian threath has re-emerged in a big way but that 's another discussion . 
  when finland declared independence in 1917 , finland and soviet russia found themselves at war . 
  peace was signed in 1920 . 
  at first finland demanded karelia to be a neutral or finnish zone and that the border be drawn like on this map i quickly drew : http://i.imgur.com/wro9y1n.png geopolitically this makes sense . 
  for finland our eastern border has always been the one where invasions come from . 
  it 's a long border and hard to defend . 
  securing our eastern border means the survival of an independent finland . 
  soviet russia was not willing to negotiate for entire karelia but for repola and poraj\u00e4rvi which had already joined the republic of finland : http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ed/tarton_rauha.png finns traded them for petsamo that was to be given to finland already in 1864 but which then never happened . 
  in these peace talks of 1920 finland failed to gain our goals of a more easily defendable border . 
  20 years later this proved to be costly as the soviet union invaded on our entire border . 
  the soviet military strategy was though poor , and partly led to the failure of the red army , but bloody scary . 
  after the war of 1939-40 our eastern border was even more vulnerable . 
  we lost a chokepoint and defensive fortifications on the karelian isthmus . 
  northern karelia and lapland were more vulnerable too . 
  finland was vulnerable . 
  after the war the soviet union continued to be aggressive ; they demanded more land in south karelia than was agreed to in the peace deal , demanded mining rights in petsamo , denied nordic plans of a military alliance , denied finnish-swedish alliance , annexed the baltic republics in june of 1940 , made demands on our internal matters including who can form the cabinet with which ministers , massed troops on our borders and planned a new invasion to begin in late 1940 . 
  in late 1940 and early 1941 the military wanted to mobilise the army because of soviet troop movements but the government refused . 
  it was tense in 1940 . 
  as a result finland approached the only power which could oppose soviet imperialism and could help us gain our land back , germany , and signed a treaty where german troops could use finnish soil to reach norway . 
  the soviet union negotiated with germany and demanded that the soviets could invade finland in november 1940 without germany interfering as agreed in the molotov-ribbentrop pact and as happened in 1939 . 
  the germans refused . 
  allying with the germans saved us from another invasion in 1940 that , with the border so vulnerable , would have led to the occupation and annexation of finland to the soviet union . 
  with german help in 1941 finland could now seek to gain more easily defendable borders in eastern karelia also freeing the karelian people of the russian threath . 
  finnish military strength was n't great enough to gain the borders as drawn in the first map i posted but still we gained river svir ( syv\u00e4ri ) and a more easily defendable buffer zone . 
  to me it 's not realistic to expect finland to stay `` neutral '' and quiet after the war of 39-40 with a huge imperialist neighbour to the east . 
  finland had a chance to solve the geopolitical challenges it faced and still faces when it comes to our eastern border but failed as germany failed . 
  i expect finland to pay the ultimate price for this somewhere in the future with a russian occupation/annexation . 
  : dddddddddd xddddddddd, 
   best place for agricultural work in january ? 
  finland . 
  there was soviet russia , the predecessor to the soviet union . 
  the soviet union then signed a treaty of non-aggression with finland in 1932 , again recognising finnish borders . 
  the soviets of course then broke that treaty seven years later . 
  what are you saying ? 
   we recognize finland 's borders . 
  that 's what you said in 1920 . 
  15 years later the ethnic cleansing of finns began in ingria . 
  a few years after that finland was invaded and you stole our land . 
  in 1997 you said you recognised and respected ukraine 's borders . 
  17 years later you invaded and stole their land . 
  you are imperialist . 
  you are fascist . 
  and you are defending these actions , you piece of shit . 
  we can not have neutral relations . 
  russia will never see finland no more than a harmless buffer state at best or a potential satellite state at worst . 
  russkie go home !, 
  so you are against recognising ukraine 's borders and territorial sovereignity ? 
  holy fuck you are one huge fascist piece of shit . 
  and suddenly this land became `` russian '' after a revolution against russian interests in ukraine while still in 1997 russia was happy to sign a treaty honouring ukraine 's borders ... yeah right . 
  and speaking of stolen land ... you hypocrite . 
  why do n't you fuck off and go cry `` russophobia ! '', 
  somewhere you imperialism defending fascist piece of shit . 
  it 's true innit ? 
  it 's time for the russian people to wake up and smell the fascism and all the death and misery that come with it . 
  i remember when the war started with all that ridiculous russian propaganda started appearing how russian people were saying `` oh , we know it 's propaganda . 
  russian people are good at recognising propaganda . '', 
  yet , here we are . 
  if the russian people know it 's all propaganda what their government is telling them , how can they stand it ? 
  their government is lying about russian soldiers dying in ukraine . 
  burying them in secret . 
  sending weapons and soldiers to ukraine while lying about it . 
  if the russian people know these are all lies why are they letting it happen ? 
  i think they do n't know . 
  they believe the propaganda and lies . 
  if they knew the truth , there 'd be a maidan revolution in russia . 
  putin , even more corrupt than yanukovich , would find himself dead or in hiding if the people knew the truth . 
  that would be a day of joy for me but before that happens more young russian men need to die for putin 's lies . 
  i wish france , germany and the uk would send more soldiers , tens of thousands of them , to the east , to finland , the baltics , poland and further south . 
  that is where they are needed . 
  russkie go home !, 
   a diplomatic solution should be nice . 
  too late . 
  russian fascists already started the war . 
  there ca n't be any referendums now , not under fascist russian occupation . 
  russkie go home !, 
  try staying on your side of the border , maybe we would n't feel so disgusted by the russians .

  `` mulatti '' was n't a derogatory term , say , in the 1950 's and before . 
  it has become a no-no since then , just like `` neekeri '' . 
  i consider the latter to be still a much worse thing to say . 
  maybe it 's just me , but the term `` sekarotuinen '' ( literally `` mixed race '' ) sounds much worse than `` mulatti '' if it is used about a person . 
  because usually one would use this when talking about dogs : `` minun koirani on sekarotuinen '' ( `` my dog is mixed-race/mixed-breed . 
  are the said tourists still mostly drunken finnish middle-aged dudes , or is there a greater variety these days ?

  there is a crap ton of them , and many are actually livable during winters as well . 
  a second summer home , basically . 
  and it was a bloody one . 
  mass executions , prison camps , the works . 
  in finland when people discuss the 1910 's , it is always about the independence and the civil war and the stuff leading to it . 
  all that distant fighting in france ( world war ... one , i believe ? ), 
  is hardly even mentioned . 
  it is in florida that has swamps and space rockets , lots of beaches and fancy hotels , lots of cuban people . 
  `` miami vice '' and `` csi : miami '' . 
  that is what comes first to my mind . 
  oh , and of course that will smith song . 
  not that much , i guess . 
  i believe the default route are group homes at first and then foster families . 
  it used to be weirder , not so much any more . 
  definitely yes . 
  i believe the kids are much more into gaming , youtube and social media these days . 
  television programs and channels have segmented heavily , targeting more specific audiences , and every channel has it 's own web presence , the major ones offering their own online program libraries . 
  i shower every day , sometimes twice a day . 
  and saturday = sauna day . 
  speaking of snow , the climate change is really showing up here . 
  some decades ago southern finland got first snow in november or early december at latest , but these days december can be almost snowless , and you get decent snowfall only in january and february . 
  and it does n't even get that cold anymore in winter . 
  i fully expect to see a completely snow-free winter in southern finland during my lifetime . 
  i remember one mid-january morning , when i looked out the window and saw green grass and fog . 
  finnish-language rap is big and popular among the teens . 
  some of the artists fill up entire stadiums . 
  older generations are more into pop/rock , but some rap artists have become well-known household names . 
  hockey = serious business, 
  yeah . 
  pretty much every town house has an indoor sauna , many terraced houses have their own saunas inside each apartment ( or a common one for the entire house ) , apartment blocks usually have a common one . 
  plus there are all the summer cabins . 
  but saunas are literally everywhere - everybody has access to one , either you have one in your apartment , or the house you live in has a communal one . 
  no , but a federation of nations and/or areas would be nice . 
  it is mostly about disliking your foreign , economic and environmental policies and your politicians and super toxic political culture . 
  so the hatred is against your government and military-industrial complex , not really against ordinary americans . 
  that said , it is baffling how many americans seem to be willing to vote against their own interests ( * cough * trump * cough * ) and defend things like corporations freely jerking people around without any restraints , the death penalty , aggressive gun culture , gung-ho militarism , blind patriotism , not having access to affordable health care etc. 
  and being proud about defending such toxic and inhuman things . 
  especially on internet forums . 
  this does n't make any sense from a european point of view , so many just write off americans defending this stuff as dumb , ignorant and brainwashed by corporations . 
  finland prohibited corporal punishment of children in 1983 . 
  only folk dance groups use them while performing . 
  also some women during festivities may wear them , but it is unusual . 
  plus , death penalty does absolutely nothing to prevent crimes . 
  it only makes the criminals more ruthless - `` so i guess i will face the death penalty now , it does n't matter one bit if i kill even more people and cause even more destruction '' . 
  the finlandia hymn . 
  sometimes , but not that frequently . 
  maybe once a month or once every few weeks . 
  were you raised in a barrel ? 
  for someone who is naive/ignorant . 
  church bells for the church-goers , and the fire alarm/air raid system . 
  there are also nation-wide emergency system on the tv , that sometimes gives warnings if there is an industrial fire releasing toxic fumes , or if someone saw a bear in lapland . 
  in finland the 6th of december is kind of a big deal . 
  there is the televised presidential ball , with all the diplomats , the cabinet , the government , artists , entertainers , athletes and whatnot coming to the presidential palace , shaking hands with the prez , dancing and drinking . 
  there is a military parade in some city . 
  there are flags everywhere , candles are brought to all the graves of dead relatives . 
  `` the unknown soldier '' ( 1955 version ) will always be aired on this day . 
  finland , well-mannered ? 
  kind of surprising :-d, 
  also , `` ulkomaanpelle '' ( foreign clown ) is used generally about all foreign people . 
  `` ryss\u00e4 '' is the most common one used about russians , other not so common ones are `` vanja '' and `` iivana '' . 
  there is also `` slobo '' , which is used both of russians and slavic people in general . 
  why would we ? 
  no gas bill . 
  water is part of the rent , which is about 340 euros per month . 
  electricity is about 30 euros for three month consumption , so about 10 euros per month . 
  we only see those in chinese kung-fu movies , or on a vacation in thailand . 
  except for the letter b. finns do n't do these kind of fancy foreign letters like b , d , f , g , w. . . 
  swedes : happy , positive , stylish , overall nice and pleasant people ( this applies to other nordic countries - norway , denmark , iceland - as well ) . 
  many finn secretly wants to be like a swede , but they do n't admit it publicly . 
  germans : punctual , pragmatic , make high-quality products french : stylish , cultured , live in a beautiful country , great and interesting history , great food british : fun people , have a great sense of humour ( finns love british humour ) , great and interesting history italy : great food , great and interesting history , happy and relaxed folks , beautiful country, 
  latin was an optional language when i was in high school/gymnasium .

  also , the sammallahdenm\u00e4ki bronze age burial ground ( and an unesco world heritage site ) . 
  there are a crap ton of stone age , bronze age and iron age sites in finland , but the vast majority of them are basically just piles of rock .

  they are in nato so i think they 'll be safe even if they were n't in eu . 
  and what kind of response is that anyways ? 
  latvia joins eu for economic and whatever reasons , then you say `` we 're gon na merge into a unified country and be a super power , you do n't like it ?

  his international politics doctoral thesis was about european integration , according to his cv he has published 30 academic articles on eu and before being a prime minister he was the minister responsible for our eu-relations . 
  so his pro-eu stance is real and strong also in finland , and he does not really worry about the the euroskeptic finns party or their voters . 
  the people who are euroskeptics are a completely different demographic group from his voters . 
  other stances , like social policies , economic , taxation and so on are the relatively unknown to finns . 
  he is very media savvy , and knows how to pull the strings of the public . 
  he is one of the most popular , if not the most popular politician of finland . 
  but his actual political opinions are quite ambiguous and unknown for the common people , as his public image tends to focus relatively much on his sports & interaction with celebrities .

  the difference is that instead of drinking small amounts often , like one beer after work daily and wine with dinner , finns binge drink . 
  i think it 's common to all nordic countries . 
  [ this comic is relevant ] ( http://i.imgur.com/czq8oqn.png ), 
  alexander stubb , the prime minister of finland from the conservative coalition party is pro-nato , to my understanding eu-federalist and economically very liberal . 
  he is often described like `` young , dynamic and media savvy '' , but he has been criticized of focusing on his public image and cheerful tweets about mundane things instead of important political issues . 
  [ this is his reaction when he realizes the cameras are on ] ( http://i.imgur.com/1ojgqc7.gif ) edit : while the coalition party is often characterized as `` conservative '' , stubb has liberal values , and previously has taken part in gay pride and made an initiative in the parliament to legalize same sex marriage ( but as the initiative was n't part of the public policy of the cabinet , it got stuck to bureaucracy on a long line of initiatives and never proceeded ) . 
   our evil warmongering homofascist empire !, 
  you make the us sound like a cheesy 70 's leather gay porn . 
  like tom of finland !, 
   i do still have doubts about the overrepresentation of homosexuality in media , it became a fad for a bit to have a queer character everywhere and to be honest that got on my nerves . 
  two points i would like to make : 1 . 
  any tiny minority that has had major trouble being accepted is deemed to be overrepresented in the media . 
  if you think that like , 2 % of people are gay , it is such a small minority that if you make 2 % of characters gay , you end up having no gay characters at all . 
  a soap opera or a reality show with 20 characters to be statistically representative , there would not be any gay characters . 
  and if every show does this , none of the shows ends up having gays . 
  several tv shows acknowledge this , and include gays not to be statistically representative , but to show that * we do n't exclude homosexuality * . 
  majority of the homosexual characters are written by straight people . 
  that 's the reason the homosexuals often stereotypical queen gays : that 's what homosexuality brings to mind for many people , and they write it out / seek reality tv contestants `` who are like gays '' . 
  many gay people are annoyed that the defining aspect of gay characters in tv is their sexuality . 
  i think a great shift in finland happened around the turn of the millennium . 
  but i do n't think finland was that homophobic to begin with when compared to several other countries . 
  sure , things have been shitty everywhere , but i think the lutheran history of finland made finns softer than in say , catholic or orthodox cultures . 
  lutheran religion in general does not strongly dictate the private lives of people , so matters like sex and relationships are n't a huge interest for the church . 
  marriage is n't even a sacrament of our lutheran state church . 
  and as the church has had an effect on the culture , our culture also has been slightly more indifferent towards homosexuality than many other countries . 
  i would assume lutheran religion is a factor also with other nordic countries . 
  in finland , homosexual acts were decriminalized in 1971 ( and ironically they also decriminalized sex with animals in 1971 , as long as the animal does not suffer ) . 
  homosexuality was declassified as an illness in 1981 . 
  but the downside with the decriminalization in 1971 was a new law that criminalized `` encouragement to homosexual sex '' , which was a compromise with the conservatives . 
  in practice this law caused self-censorship in media on accepting homosexuality , as no one wanted to be sued . 
  the law criminalizing `` encouragement to homosexual sex '' was removed in 1999 . 
  after this the media started to be more open about handling homosexuality . 
  same sex civil partnerships came legal in 2001 . 
  after that the public opinion on homosexuality has had a big shift . 
  i would even dare to claim that in the 90 's our parliament was more progressive than our citizens , but during the 21st century the shift has been so big that now the citizens are more progressive than our parliament . 
  now days the majority of finns support same sex marriage and equal adoption rights for same sex couples , but the parliament is still struggling to legalize them . 
  the citizen initiative for same sex marriage legislation has been the largest initiative in finland , collecting twice the amount of needed signatures in one day ( the amount needed is 50 000 signatures during 6 months , the initiative got about 100 000 signatures in about 24 hours ) . 
  how i see is that the public opinion changed in response to the changes in legislation in 1999 and 2001 . 
  when the state declared that same sex couples have the right for civil partnership and freedom to speech applies to talking about homosexual acts also , it sent a message to the people that maybe gays are n't that bad . 
  the more legal equality people have , the less people can base their prejudice on law . 
  and as people can not base their prejudice on law , a lot of people start thinking that maybe there was no reason for prejudice to begin with . 
  and even the homophobic attitudes have changed . 
  rarely do homophobes in finland deny the right for civil partnership from gays , even though they would oppose equal marriage rights . 
  even majority of the homophobes seem accept that same sex couples have the right to civil partnerships . 
  in addition to all this , also the general western attitudes and culture , especially in the 90 's have had an influence in my opinion . 
  the tv tower at least , very faintly . 
  you have to know where to look . 
  i 've heard that on clear days you can see [ this building ] ( http://www.ylitalot.net/images/2008/02/img_8801_c.jpg ) in espoo from tallinn . 
   but not really convinced it hugely opens up berlin from there . 
  i 'm not saying that it would be * the way * to get to berlin , but it would be a viable option in say , in the year 2050 . 
  the eu could be very interested in building an rail infrastructure within the eu to lessen the dependence of our integration on fossil fuels . 
  if train technology keeps upgrading and climate/energy issues are taken more into consideration , i see it very possible that in 2050 people would consider trains as a viable option way much more than today . 
  it would not be as fast as flying , but it could be cheaper . 
  you get on a train 20:00 in helsinki , go to sleep in the train at 22:00 after it has passed tallinn , sleep the night and arrive at berlin at 12:00 local time . 
  and it would not only be helsinki-berlin . 
  it would also be tallinn-berlin , riga-berlin and warsaw-berlin . 
  sure , it 's not as fast as flying , but it 's not dependent on fossil fuels . 
  the difference with the channel tunnel and helsinki-tallinn as i see it is that the tunnel helsinki-tallinn would be * a direct connection * between two capitals that are way closer than london and some other capital . 
  tallinn and helsinki are on the opposite shores of the same gulf , 80km apart and on clear days you can see the highest buildings of tallinn from helsinki . 
  the combined population of helsinki + tallinn is larger than the capitals brussels + luxembourg city , and the distance is under a half of the distance between brussels & luxembourg . 
  there is already substantial traffic between the cities , the ferry taking two hours from helsinki to tallinn . 
  the channel tunnel is n't like london-paris or london-brussels . 
  the distance between london and any capital on the other side of the channel is much larger than the distance between helsinki and tallinn . 
  the channel tunnel does not combine two capital urban areas into a twin city . 
  a tunnel between helsinki and tallinn would effectively mean that people can live in tallinn and work in helsinki , using the tunnel just to commute , and economic cooperation between the cities would be much greater ( helsinki being the economic hub of finland and tallinn being the economic hub of estonia ) . 
  i would also assume that eu might be interested in this because of energy/climate reasons . 
  they were not an important issue 20 years ago when the channel tunnel was built , but currently the eu might very well plan that public transport in the eu could shift focus more on rails in the future , meaning that one could more easily travel the capitals helsinki - ( tallinn-riga-warsaw ) - berlin with a train instead of flying from helsinki to berlin . 
  not an example from germanic languages , but from latin . 
  the hindi/sanskrit word `` maharaja '' means `` great king '' or something , composed of words `` maha '' , great and `` raja '' , king . 
  the latin equivalent would be `` magnus rex '' , also meaning `` great king '' . 
  the similarity is somewhat distant , but hit me when i was in india and learned that they mean the same thing . 
   that you should have read better . 
  it 's not my fault that you are a complete idiot . 
  ( but that was a hyperbole , so you have no right to claim you were insulted , and if you feel insulted , it only proves that you should have read better to understand that was a hyperbole . ),

  obviously there 's a difference between the nsa and moon landing is ake ideas . 
  and as far as conspiracies go pwh sounded reasonable to me . 
  but maybe it is n't . 
  will have to read a little bit myself . 
  i do think it 's important to find the underlying reasons for the american empire . 
  even tho that might not have anything to do with petro dol\u00f6ars, 
  5 years ago you 'd be called conspiratard if you said the nsa is listening to all our phone calls, 
  wait , did sarkozy start it ? 
  gon na read up a bit . 
  brb but yeah btw lybia actually had the highest hdi in africa back in like 2010 . 
  also , kinda socialistic i think, 
  your reading of history seems to be the official one . 
  not that there is anything wrong with that . 
  i , like most people , like to find out the real life actual reasons for things and credible real conspiracies . 
  you kinda seem like you know what you 're talking about . 
  what the hell is the pwh, 
  he is a decent manager . 
  not much else, 
   this is / r/conspiracy level junk or it is a different perspective to look at the libyan conflict from . 
  or do you buy what the obama administration would have you believe that nato * only * attacked because of how humanitarian and nice they are ? 
  they are an ethnically divided country , with only about 50 % being `` persian '' or whatever . 
  so many small languages and ethnicities . 
  also there are young , liberal and also left wing intelligentia type people . 
  so it 's really hard to predict the future of such a large country and what would happen after war . 
  what tha fok did ye just focking say about me , ye little twat ?

   isis had its origins in the saddam regime obviously  a form of it would have risen anyways highly debatable . 
  did you just randomly google something or do you know the contents of your posted article ? 
   could every british adult vote for him ? 
  if they coughed up 3 pounds for the membership in labour they could . 
  it was a new model for electing party leader that was expected to bring in another blairite , they were wrong . 
  there was a huge movement of leftist minded people who joined the party to vote for corbyn . 
  he won overwhelmingly . 
  of course there would be benefits . 
  fucking daily mail readers . 
  `` oh , no corbyn is gon na be weak on isis '' i tell you what haters . 
  if someone as anti war and peace loving as corbyn had been pm back in 2003 there would probably not have been an iraq war , ergo isis would n't even fucking exist . 
  he was democratically elected to that position . 
  if he feels he ca n't do his job properly i 'm sure he 'll resign . 
  he has actually been a decent party leader , moving cameron on saudi arabia etc. 
  just because he is actually a leftist does n't mean he is unelectable . 
  napoleon and washington did things that changed the world for the better . 
  rhodes , not so much, 
  different times . 
  cecil rhodes is most definitely not comparable to napoleon or george washington . 
  do you think a group that call themselves `` soliders of odin '' , ( ironic since they ca n't be very aryan or viking related ) . 
  do you think they just want to hang out and be peaceful ? 
  these people are patrolling in joensuu . 
  back in the 90s they had a problem with skinheads . 
  a blck basketball player had to move from the city because of the racism . 
   police have ... received information about three cases of sexual assault it 's one police chief guy . 
  koskim\u00e4ki who has claimed that there are unprecedented amounts of sexual assault . 
  naturally three reported cases is no where near unprecedented . 
  got a huge cut in my head playing football . 
  an ambulanxe came and some russian guy sowed up my head after an hour or so . 
  cost me 60 $ for everything . 
  if you want better care there are private alternatives . 
  i like it, 
  a tunnel project would bring a lot of stimulation to stagnant economy . 
  problem is , none of the parties seem interested in stimulation of the economy even tho we have a high credit rating, 
  cool thanks, 
  i like the jyben 's version . 
  it 's maybe not the most historically important moments , but it 's the events that define finland 's history in the mind of the every man . 
  i do n't have a source on it . 
  but i 've seen footage from the parliament during the failed coup attempt in 1981 . 
  the communist party leader carillo was on of the two parliament people who did n't get down once the soliders opened fire . 
  instead , he stayed upright in his seat , smoking a cigarette . 
  no matter what you think of communists , that 's pretty cool . 
  that 's what i 'm thinking . 
  i ca n't see soviet leadership allowing screenings of rambo . 
  hollywood films were accepted behind the iron curtain ? 
  or only art movies about the vietnam war ? 
  that 's a shitty talking point though . 
  in europe our economies are not reliant on heavy industry . 
  we have exported our production of most things to low wage countries such as china . 
  while we do n't have that much emissions , the emissions that are the result of our consumption is huge . 
  you are the only nation who has climate change as the third most important issue . 
  so clearly they have had an effect . 
   i would like to see france 's government take a very hard line against radical islam , call it that , and aggressively pursue leads against terror suspects do n't they do it now ? 
  do n't they already punish religious practices that breach french law ? 
   and greatly incentivise social and economic assimilation of immigrant muslim communities integration is swell . 
  prevent youth unemployment and disenfranchment and you 'll hardly ever have a terrorist again . 
  unfourtunately the economic and practical realities lead to segragated communities and youth with a splintered identity . 
  telling them you 'd have to choose between being french and being muslim cant be good . 
  implying this is what creates the tensions that lead to terrorism . 
  a big argument against the jews was always that their allegiance was n't with germany but with the jewish community . 
  making the same devicive statements towards muslims is not helpful .

  the current humanitarian situation in greece is caused by the austerity of the troika . 
  that is not the case with poorer eu countries . 
  eu is naturally offering developement funds for poorer countries than greece , but the condition for poorer countries is n't that their humanitarian developement must be set back , like in greece . 
   at the end of the day , the greeks want a standard of living higher than what they create , and want someone else to pay for it . 
  i 'm not expecting 25 years of mismanagement to be fixed in 6 months . 
  but greece has had austerity for 5 years and the humanitarian situation during those years has crumbled significantly compared to the other countries you said . 
  it 's not just about `` fixing mismanagement '' . 
  it 's also about people . 
  we can not `` fix mismanagement '' and force austerity eternally to get nice numbers , if that means worsening and worsening the humanitarian situation . 
  which one is more people : the numbers or the actual humanitarian consequences ? 
   of course there is a lot of pain in the process . 
  who is the one to define what is the `` proper limit '' for acceptaple pain the greek people should experience under austerity ? 
  is it the troika or the greek people who know better what is too much pain ? 
  is it so that troika can do everything they want and just say `` of course there is a lot of pain '' and still go on , without hearing the greek people ? 
  it had n't been 81 years right after wwii . 
  yet people were n't like `` sucks to be you '' but other countries actively tried to get ( west ) germany on its feet . 
  my point was n't to blame germany as such , but to note that blaming greece and saying `` deal it with yourself ! '', 
  is silly , as it does not solve anything and does not help the greek people . 
  after wwii it would have been silly to say to west germany that `` well , your own fault , suffer the consequences '' . 
  and it was not done . 
  germany was helped , even though they themselves caused the crisis . 
  not tons of people have the tone `` it 's your fault , so you do n't deserve help '' . 
  well , teuvo hakkarainen did describe africans as `` niggers '' and suggested that gays , lesbians and somalis should be moved to \u00c5land islands . 
  and halla-aho was convicted in court of `` agitation '' towards somali people when he said perhaps they have a genetic predisponent to steal . 
  both were member of the parliament at those times , but neither was expelled . 
   you think you can threaten europe with close ties with russia and china ? 
  oh be my guest , go ahead and cozy up to them . 
  the ones losing worse by far will be greece . 
  also , this demonstrates that eu has failed . 
  which by tons of standards is much higher in finland than in greece . 
   neither forced solidarity works , rather that leaves both countries feeling left out . 
  forced solidarity in welfare states is called taxes . 
  that 's an example that works , as for example in finland people largely approve taxes to support the welfare state and to distribute wealth . 
  to my understanding , the humanitarian consequences of austerity in greece are much more severe than in those other countries you mentioned , and the imf has recognized the austerity was much worse for the greek economy than they predicted . 
  humanitarily speaking , there 's no way the required austerity would have worked forever without significant backlash . 
  well , `` the third world '' originally referred to neutral countries of the cold war , like finland , sweden , most of africa and south america . 
  but now it refers more to underdeveloped economies or something like that . 
  so these terms can change quite fast . 
   it is a tragic thing , as millons of ordinary greeks will have to suffer because its ruling elite failed . 
  and other eu countries refuse to help them . 
  greece is cheaper ? 
  and greece mediterranean climate archipelago and harbors are much easier to profit with tourism and trade with than some estonian swamps and hills . 
   no taxation without representation . 
  if i have to pay for greece i want to have a say how the money should be spend . 
  well , we do have the european parliament which controls the eu budget , and if the eu were to redistribute wealth like the us , i 'd suppose the parliament would have a say on that . 
  while eu currently does not collect taxes , it does collect fees from member countries , and if you want to influence that flow of money , vote in the eu parliamentary elections . 
  and as for how national governments redistribute wealth inside eu , that 's what our national elections are for . 
  hitler was democratically elected to the parliament and the nazis were the second largest party in the parliament , and the democratically elected president hindenburg made hitler the chancellor of germany due to lack of a better government . 
  had german people voted better , the nazis would not have seized power . 
  so yea , one can blame the german voters of that time . 
  i actually have n't even thought about how many times a week i have to shop groceries . 
  i have never thought it 's an issue . 
  people can make bad voting decisions , but are we really that cruel that if the consequences are catasthropic for the people we just do n't care , even though we are supposed to be in the same union with the motto * united in diversity * ? 
  germany also was a democracy , and then germans voted for example hitler and other nazis who democratically rose to power , changed the form of government started wwii and then organized a highly industrialised holocaust and then they lost the war . 
  yet after this the other countries were n't like `` sucks to be german , your own fault , deal with your shit yourself '' but other countries actively tried to get ( west ) germany on its feet . 
  i 'd pay the greek bills because greek people are people too , and the current economic situation is just causing humanitarian trouble there , harming the people . 
  greek are still human beings , and being within the eu and eurozone , it is politically more feasible to support them than say , poorer nations in central america . 
  as a finn i 'd support restructuring of the eu to include wealth distribution like in the us , so yea , i 'd be okay with richer countries helping poorer countries to get on their feet . 
  like i 'm not against that the capital region of finland economically supports the poorer regions of finland . 
  the current crisis just highlights that the current structure of the eu is a failure . 
  if we allow the eu to push greece into more austerity causing more humanitarian trouble for the sake of some economic ideology , it merely shows that the current eu is n't really as interested in human well being and human rights as it claims . 
  this undermines the entire purpose of the eu and makes the entire eu much weaker . 
  the motto of eu is `` united in diversity '' but the current situation is more like `` divided in diversity '' , where different countries just think about themselves without any bit of united solidarity , wich was supposed to be the core of eu and the purpose of eu . 
  to unite europe so that there would be no more humanitarian catastrophes like war . 
  but now the troika is willing to let the humanitarian situation of greece to crumble for the sake of economic ideology . 
   greeks have democratic right to vote for other people 's money and those people should just give it to them ? 
  no one claimed anything like that . 
  i think european cities generally also rely much more on public transport , so that 's why they are not that convenient for cars . 
   have you actually considered that people just disagree wit you and therefore downvote you ? 
  that 's not how downvotes should be used . 
  the reddit recommendation is that downvotes are for comments that do n't contribute to the discussion , not for comments you disagree with . 
  a comment with an opinion that contributes to the discussion should not be downvoted just because you disagree with that opinion . 
  i read it from [ here ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/economics/11604518/why-syriza-are-doing-everything-eu-creditors-demand.html ) . 
  in the first quatet of 2015 syriza managed to collect 15 % more taxes than the monthly target , totaling to almost 500 million euros . 
  syriza has been collecting taxes 15 % above the monthly target and overall their primary budget in the first quater was almost 2 billion euros more than the economics had forecasts . 
  several other measures are dependent on does the troika agree with syriza . 
  but as troika is willing to financially support only if greece does austerity , and syriza wants other reforms than austerity , they lack the support for all the reforms . 
  in the first quater of 2015 syriza managed to collect almost 2 billion euros more than the economics had forecasts and managed to collect 15 % more taxes than the monthly target . 
  what are you talking about ? 
  greece had five years of austerity with pro-austerity government . 
  the government did not fight against austerity but endorsed it . 
  it did n't work . 
  even imf has admitted that . 
  greek people for large part very well realized the country has to change . 
  that 's partly why they voted the old parties responsible for the crisis out of the government . 
  the old parties were seen much more tolerant of corruption and cronyism and syriza was notably more opposed to corruption , oligarchs and such . 
  they voted agains certain types of reforms . 
  and voting syriza in power instead of the old corrupt parties was a vote * for * reforms . 
  the gdp went again down before syriza , and originally it went up only because of a temporary influx of tourists . 
  it was not some overall recovery of the economy but a small temporary rise in one sector . 
   ultimately the greek people and the state is responsible for greece 's situation right now . 
  sure , there was a lot of enabling by the eu and banks . 
  so why do you move the responsibility `` ultimately '' to greek people and state when you even yourself acknowledge that eu and banks also were partial to it ? 
  when the euro was introduced in greece , for example german banks were keen on giving credit to greece to help the exports of germany to greece , and the banks closed their eyes from the financial risks . 
  likewise previously greece was led by quite corrupt parties like nea dimokratia and pasok , and the investment bank goldman sachs [ helped the greek government to falsify ] ( http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/greek-debt-crisis-how-goldman-sachs-helped-greece-to-mask-its-true-debt-a-676634.html ) it 's economic situation . 
  banks did know some of the risks involved with greece , but they still gave credit . 
  it should also be asked * do the banks have any responsibility of making bad credit investments ? 
  * or should it be so that banks can always give credit to anyone and not care about the risks , as if the risks come true , governments will always bail the banks out with taxpayer money ? 
  and also about responsibility : likewise ultimately the german people who voted the nazis in power and the state of germany were responsible for the consequences of wwii for germany , as germany started the war . 
  still the state debt of germany was cancelled .

  if you do n't want to engage into a discussion and back up and rationalize what you say , then your opinions do n't matter . 
  throwing magic words around that you have learned from media and discussions do n't make an opinion , they just form a waste of time . 
  excuse me , but it is mercantilism that thanks to free trade people all over the world can afford more ? 
  farmers in india can afford nokia phones ? 
  more and more people in china can afford volkswagens ? 
  how is it that when everybody has more , you call it mercantilism , you need to start backing up your words . 
  the global economy has been growing all the time . 
  billions of people have been lifted from absolute poverty thanks to ever increasing economic growth . 
  if you do n't want to go to india or china to see this , you might want to compare photos of what eastern europe looked alike before the collapse of the iron curtain and how it looks now . 
  well , actually developing countries should be and some are net importers . 
  the idea simply to say is that investments and consumption of today are paid by future growth . 
  the eu commission would take sweden to the eu court due to breach of accession treaty , and the eu court would then decide if sweden has breached its accession treaty , and if so what penalties it would get . 
   that would be a dumb move to force certain countries to join the eurozone . 
  all eu member states , excluding uk and denmark , have an treaty obligation to join the eurozone . 
  the thing in here is that countries are willfully breaking their treaty obligation and not working actively to join the eurozone . 
  that has got to stop . 
  either non-eurozone countries get their act together and fulfill their treaty obligations or the eu commission starts process to freeze their membership . 
  well , if we define that anti austerity is not cutting state budgets , but either maintaining them as they are or expanding them then deficits will stay high , and that will worsen dept to gdp ration until it is unattainable . 
  thus the only way anti austerity will work if it concentrates on increasing economic growth that will keep the debt to gdp ratio tolerable . 
  this means that ... * troubled economies need to make deep structural changes that they actually have n't done to this day . 
  * states have to seek ways to produce more from what they got , i.e. 
  make services more efficient , increase quality of services , etc. . . 
  i 'm very doubtful on do the troubled states have political will to actually implement structural reforms and do they have enough organizational knowhow to increase efficiency of the state . 
  not every technique works the same in every company , however the main thing is that companies need to have the freedom to manage themselves as they want . 
  that is the main thing . 
  in europe what has happened is that states have dictated strict policies that have hampered the ability of european companies to organize themselves as efficiently as possible , thus hampering growth and creating inefficiencies and in general decreasing risk taking . 
   but that is all dependent on what the time parameters are for each country , and how each country is doing with regards to that . 
  these powers surely do n't apply to the uk and denmark , but only those that joined after the $ was introduced . 
  finland joined the eu in 1995 , and joined the eurozone in 1999 , the maastricht treaty obligations were known in 1992 when ec membership negotiations were started . 
  that is 7 years , or 4 years , depending on from where you count . 
  that should be enough for most countries . 
  lets not forget that many countries have fulfilled their treaty obligations , and fast : slovenia ( 3 years ) , malta ( 4 years ) , cyprus ( 4 years ) , slovakia ( 5 years ) and estonia ( 7 years ) . 
  what goes to uk and denmark , while the eu does n't have power in this case to throw them out , adequate power should and could be used to make a case of either leave the union or adopt the euro . 
  like i said before , a single market without single currency makes the market untenable in long run . 
   the sort of process you outline would take several years at the minimum , probably well over a decade ( considering some states that joined in 2004 still have n't adopted the $ , and that 's 9 years ago ) . 
  if over 10 years after the eurocrisis ( and with the $ performing strongly ) these nations still do n't want $ membership then there is something fundamentally wrong with the currency . 
  it does n't matter do these countries want to join the euro or not , they have treaty obligation to do so . 
  if they do n't do so , then they are breaking their treaty obligations not only towards the eu but towards all other member states . 
  usually if one participant of treaty decides to break it , then that treaty it is void . 
  so should the member ship of those countries that broken their obligations . 
  oh yes they do . 
  eu commission has the obligation to monitor that member states fulfill their accession treaty obligations , and if and when they see that a member state willfully breaks its treaty obligations , they can take it to a eu court . 
  penalties on breaking treaty obligations can range from fines to ultimately freezing membership of the treaty breaking member state . 
  in my honest opinion , as soon as this crisis is over , eurozone should use its financial and political power to either make the rest of the eu countries to either join the eurozone or leave the union . 
  they can , but that may not be so wise . 
  many believe that there will be a day of reckoning as soon as crisis in the eurozone calm down , meaning that in some point of time eu commission with the backing up of leading eurozone states will push things to point where either non-eurozone states join it or leave the eu and possible the single market . 
  the single market was created to function with single currency , the current state of things , were some are n't in the eurozone and thus can assist their industries with devaluations/deprecation of their currencies is untenable . 
  actually your currency would be euro or you would be kicked out of the european union . 
  you have obligation to join the euro due to your accession treaty into the eu . 
  no thanks . 
  i 'm enjoying some red wine and bread thank you very much ... what you should ask , why are you expecting that somebody else is responsible on setting up your life ? 
  why is employer responsible for your life more than you ? 
  slaves ? 
  you as an employee make everyday a decision to go to work , it is your decision . 
  anytime you do n't want it , you can quit . 
  you have that freedom . 
  you are in charge , but also have the responsibility that comes with your decisions . 
   the way the eu is structured , the labour market ca n't work the way it works in the us . 
  each country is on its own , they 're trying to force the large corporations to stay in their country ; they lose too much if the companies leave . 
  the government will have to pick up the tab and pay unemployment benefits , etc for those people laid off . 
  most eu countries are bigger than us states and have much more diverse industry and company structure than us states . 
  even if you would have large company relocating , or going bankrupt , it really would n't be felt in the national level . 
   in the us , this is not an issue : if a company leaves california for nevada , it does n't affect that much the state of california because the unemployment benefits , social security , food stamps , etc. 
  are paid from the federal budget to which the company and the new employees will contribute in the new state . 
  if you have a very dynamic economy , even if one company or industry sector is feeling down , the rest of the economy will pick up the slack . 
  for example in the same time as nokia has downsized , the same time other companies in other industry sectors have recruited ex-nokia employees not to mention all the startups . 
   as long as the eu is not going to be a true federation , we ca n't have a flexible job market . 
  we can and should have flexible job market because that is the only way to create new enterprises and new industries . 
  clearly having rigid labor market does n't work for spain , maybe instead of trying to protect few jobs they should concentrate on fueling the economy with freedom - you know , capitalism , it works . 
  in finland we have concept of term of notice during , this is the time employ have to pay wages to the employ , but employ also have to work for it ... * if employment has continued at max 1 year = 14 days * over 1 year , but not more than 4 years = 1 month * over 4 years , but less than 8 years = 2 months * over 8 years , but less than 12 years = 4 months * over 12 years = 6 months and yes , this is too much , there should be no term of notice , no severance pay . 
  we have unemployment funds and social security to cover people , there is really no reason to have term of notice . 
  ... read more about spain  prior to the spanish labor reforms , the labor act required , under certain circumstances such as unjustified dismissals , that employers make severance payments to the terminated employee computed on the basis of 45 days ' gross salary per year of employment with a maximum of 42 months ' salary . 
  the reform law reduces the required severance payments to 33 days per year of employment and caps payments at a maximum of 24 months . 
  additionally , if an employer can demonstrate three consecutive quarters of losses , the employer will now only be required to pay 20 days of severance per year of employment . 
  24 months is absolutely a killer !, 
  edit : sorry , you said the same , unfortunately i 'm running in week batteries . 
   i do n't think this is an issue . 
  i know that the entrepreneurs complain about this , but i do n't see countries with weaker protection for employees being more entrepreneurial . 
  well , there is the us of america . 
  and you know this is not only about entrepreneurs , this also about big corporations , because successful start-up become fast growing companies and fast growing companies become fast growing corporations . 
  if you want to have the next oracle to be born in europe , you need to give ability not only entrepreneurs but also to companies and corporations do what they need to do to be as successful , as profitable and as fast growing as they can be . 
  that is capitalism . 
   you can fire employees with temporary contracts for free the first three years ( two years before ) . 
  new : you can fire for free permanent employees under 30 years the first year . 
  if your company is losing money or revenue ( even having a net profit ) the government the firing costs will be 20 days per year and the government will pay 8 days per year . 
  and the government allows you to use interns as employees and you can fire them for free and you can pay them under minimum wage . 
  you need to have the ability to fire anybody at any time . 
  european companies need to have the ability to for example imitate what jack welsch did in ge ...  former general electric co. . ceo jack welch is the most passionate advocate . 
  he believes that managers should assess their employees every year , and divide them into three categories : the top 20 percent , the middle 70 percent , and the bottom 10 percent . 
    the top 20 should be showered with praise , affection and various and generous financial rewards . 
  `` sprinkling '' financial rewards over a much larger group is a mistake , mr. welch argues . 
    the middle 70 should be given coaching , training , and thoughtful goal-setting , with an eye toward giving them an opportunity to move into the top . 
  keeping them motivated is the most difficult part of the manager 's task , he says . 
  `` you do not want to lose the vast majority of your middle 70 -- you want to improve them , '' mr. welch says in his 2005 book , '' winning . ''   as for the bottom 10 percent , `` there is no sugarcoating this , '' mr. welch says . 
  `` they have to go . '' this is the ability that european companies are missing . 
  just think about how fundamentally different companies would act if they could just from time to time fire their weakest links , from young to senior , everybody under radar . 
  two of the biggest reasons ... * firing employes is either expensive or down right impossible . 
  companies need to be able fire employes when ever they need to and without costs.this means companies ca n't build hyper competitive culture and expansion and growth are much more riskier . 
  * declaring personal bankruptcy is impossible in most european countries . 
  this means that risk associated to failure of new enterprise or startup can easily be prohibitive .

  and in 2006 it was ranked as the # 3 most beloved finnish painting of all time . 
  why ? 
  well , probably because its popularity surged during the winter war and has remained high ever since . 
  and when looked at in that perspective it undeniably has it all . 
  ah , burning charcoal is a very different process and does not work on open air as then you 'll get ash . 
  for charcoal and also for pine tar , which used to be the biggest finnish export especially to the british in the 18-19th cent , you 'd need to dig a pit first . 
  then carefully load the timber into it to get optimal results , cover it , keep the air intakes in check , and burn it very very slowly in almost no oxygen conditions . 
  i 'm lucky to have an old pine tar pit near my family 's summer cottage in the northern finland . 
  a very elaborate construction .

  yep , in finland slash-and-burn was the primary method of farming for centuries since at least 2400-2200 bc and continued until 18-19th cent . 
  in the method trees were cut and some collected , the remaining biomass was left to dry , the area was burned , and then farmed for some years . 
  the painting depicts the burning phase . 
  despite the bad reputation slash-and-burn farming was apparently sustainable in finland . 
  because of slow rotation of farming areas and low population density the method provided relatively good crops , did n't destroy ecosystems and actually gave room for new ones which are now endangered . 
  here 's an interesting paper : [ sustainability in danger ? 
  slash-and-burn cultivation in nineteenth-century finland and twentieth-century southeast asia ] ( http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/3985685?uid=3737976&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=4&amp;sid=21104804469767 )  we claim that slash-and-burn agriculture can , under certain circumstances , be considered sustainable , although ecological sustainability is very difficult to prove , and questions concerning social and economic sustainability also must be taken into account . 
  history , however , shows that slash-and-burn cultivation has for centuries provided a basis for some fairly sustainable societies . 
  in addition , swidden agriculture ought to be evaluated in a regional context , because other agents and external factors also determine how environmentally sound slash-and-burn is . 
  hence slash-and-burn agriculture can not a priori be condemned as a destructive and untenable method of cultivation .

   why are you angry ? 
  you mispelled amused . 
   did i say something that offended you ? 
  not at all . 
   i just wanted clearification on whether will it be a nato thing or a usa-romania thing . 
  i believe i already provided the relevant clarification before your tangent to other things . 
  yeah , good for you . 
  like i said the neighborhoods in the middle east have been nothing but peaceful last few decades , and the everlasting nature of the personal friendship of your family of power with gadaffi is just one more example of the enduring stability on the region . 
  with such far lasting friendships i 'm quite sure you 'll never need a short-to-mid range missile shield . 
  to be onest , after your arguments it does seem kinda wasteful project . 
  perhaps some money could be saved by excluding specifically greece from the missile shield . 
  being such friends with gadaffi there absolutely wo n't be no worries never ever . 
  albeit , and this may be only rumours , i have never met gadaffi personally , but i 've heard he stinks . 
  yes , i read and understood your point the first time you wrote it . 
  what i do n't understand is why you so consistently have failed to understand my replies to you . 
  do you know how much 83 billion cubic meters of natural gas is in terms of domestic heating consumption ? 
  to put it bluntly : the range you 're quoting does not mean that . 
  and if you do believe it does then facepalms for failing physics . 
  also chem and biological . 
  well , good for you for never needing a short-to-mid range missile shield , then . 
  and i have also heard the neighborhoods in the middle east have been nothing but peaceful last few decades . 
  yeah , i 'm pretty sure your gas boiler wont . 
  but if it actually requires more than * 83 billion cubic meters * of gas to run i 'd say ditch the damned thing . 
  i mean , most other gas boilers run with much much less than that . 
   is it going to be a nato base or just a usa base ? 
  it 's part of the nato missile defence system phase two designed to protect southern europe from short-to-mid range ballistic missiles . 
  as per the treaty with romania the us will build , maintain , and operate the land-based bmd site in romania . 
  so do n't worry , you greeks get that part of the missile shielding capability as a freebie , wo n't cost you guys a cent - albeit i 'm not sure how well you 're covered with that station alone . 
  ah , but the joke 's on them as putin is a great athlete and sportsman as exemplified by the fact that he already has the much coveted super bowl ring : [ patriots ' robert kraft : vladimir putin stole my super bowl ring ] ( http://www.cbssports.com/nfl/eye-on-football/22429359/patriots-owner-robert-kraft-vladimir-putin-stole-my-super-bowl-ring ), 
  [ `` halv liter ! '', 
  '' ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=susrm6aclbo ), 
  this is 2014 , not 2007 . 
  with the 83 bcm storage capacity and related reverse flows you can run domestic heating for a long time . 
  unfortunately i do n't have the time to check if your numbers based on your assumptions are in fact correct . 
  but , if you like , you can easily find accurate and most up-to-date data on the relevant eurostat tables yourself . 
  for example on their wiki : http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/statistics_explained/index.php/energy_production_and_imports or on their database portal : http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/portal/page/portal/energy/data/database  this is indeed far from the picture i sketched , you are right . 
  it is , however , not as small as you sketched either . 
  fortunately these are all small countries . 
  i wonder how long it 'll take before the problems are solved , though . 
  the problem in your assessment is not merely your estimates of numbers but your oversimplified reliance on those percentages . 
  in case of sudden stop of russian gas and/or oil imports the relevant questions would be : 1 . in short term : how big are the available storaged reserves ? 
  ( i 'm skipping oil/coal/etc energy storages here , look into it yourself ) currently the eu natural gas storage reserves are at over 77 bcm , or at about 93 % of the full 83 bcm storage capacity ( [ see this table and the relevant graphs ] ( http://transparency.gie.eu/index.php ) ) . 
  that amount corresponds roughly to about half of the annual natural gas imports from russia - remember that russia is only the second largest supplier with less than 30 % of eu natural gas imports . 
  in terms of volume if the russian gas tap would get suddenly closed tomorrow the eu has an equivalent of about six months of russian gas supply already in storages . 
  in terms of energy content the current reserve is roughly 3000 pj or about 17 % of eu total annual natural gas energy consumption of about 18000 pj . 
  with such storaged reserve , if russian gas taps were suddenly closed , and even if there were no additional measures in place such as fuel replacing , prioritizing or energy saving , no-one would freeze to death next winter provided there 's enough injection capacity from the storages to the consumers in different countries . 
  but * without any other measures * after few months there likely would be supply shortages of natural gas in some countries without the russian supply ( varies between countries ) . 
  2 . in short-to-mid term : how large share of it can be replaced by other sources of energy ? 
  again varies greatly between countries . 
  for example in finland it is required by law to have at least five months of fuel supplies in storage ( not natural gas ) in case of supply disruptions , and also required that power stations using natural gas are able to switch to other fuels at will or replaced with other capacity . 
  regarding other countries here 's a very informative read , albeit it does n't cover all eu members : [ energy supply security : the emergency response of iea countries - 2014 edition ] ( http://www.iea.org/publications/freepublications/publication/energy-supply-security-the-emergency-response-of-iea-countries-2014.html ) 3 . in the short term and long : to what extent the russian energy can be replaced by other suppliers , fuels , or energy sources ? 
  for example , there are many oil exporters in the world , and even if a country is currently importing most of its oil from russia does not mean it * has to * nor that russia is the only possible supplier that can not be replaced in the short-to-mid term . 
  but natural gas is likely much more difficult to replace in short-to-mid term due to dependence on the current pipeline infrastucture . 
  what i 'm getting at is that merely looking at your ( assumed ) percentages does not tell us that much by itself . 
   and here we do find a lot of countries in the 80-100 region . 
  pls just stop right there , and take a look at the graph i posted previously . 
  you 'll find only some countries having up to 30-40 % natural gas of their energy mix . 
  what you now mean with the 80-100 region is totally different thing : it indicates how much of natural gas is from russia , not how much of energy consumption is natural gas . 
  for example , sweden uses very little natural gas . 
  even if 100 % of that tiny amount of gas is from russia sweden is hardly dependend on it . 
  and while finland currently gets 100 % of its natural gas from russia , that gas is only about 10 % of all primary energy usage and would be replaced by other sources of energy if it was cut off . 
   although the continent itself may only use oil for 20 % of its power consumption ( which i think is a too low estimate , but i 'm on a simple android now , ca n't find good sources quickly ) , some eastern european countries rely on it in the 80-100 % region . 
  [ national shares of fuels in gross inland energy consumption , 2012 , percentage ] ( http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/statistics_explained/images/0/0b/f6_eu28_gross_inland_energy_consumption_3_2012.png ) only cyprus and malta have that big share of oil in their energy mix . 
  while i do n't know how much of that oil is russian i do believe it would be possible to use oil also from other suppliers if necessary . 
   i do n't know how much reserves there are , almost 80 bcm in oct 8 , graph : http://transparency.gie.eu/index.php/graphs?code=99_99_99 also , here 's an informative related resource : [ energy supply security : the emergency response of iea countries - 2014 edition ] ( http://www.iea.org/publications/freepublications/publication/energy-supply-security-the-emergency-response-of-iea-countries-2014.html ),

  the parliamentary groups made it clear to the european council that they will not vote for any other for commission presidency than juncker , and referred to the lisbon treaty . 
  it 's very reasonable this will go on in the future . 
  i just wanted to highlight the difference between sawdust and cellulose , as sawdust is a familiar dull texture and brings up negative connotations as something to eat , and is even used as a negative descriptor for some foods , so equating cellulose with sawdust is a bit unfair to foods with cellulose . 
  i mean the toys still are * in * the kinder egg , completely enclosed in the chocolate egg . 
  no , in kinder the toys are inside the chocolate shell . 
  cellulose is not sawdust . 
  cellulose is a carbohydrate which makes up a large part of plant fibers in general . 
  it can be derived from sawdust , but it 's present in most plants . 
  for example cotton is one of the purest form of cellulose in nature but is not sawdust . 
  generally cellulose is a dietary fiber and it 's good to have it in your diet . 
  it was n't actual sawdust but cellulose , and it was in grated cheese . 
  it 's used normally to prevent clumping . 
  cellulose itself is a rather common part of vegetables . 
  it 's carbohydrate as a plant fiber . 
  there 's this rather ingenious thing sold in some developing countries : a iron lump shaped like a fish . 
  the point is that when people cook stews and soups they keep the iron fish in the pot and iron dissolves from it so it helps preventing anemia . 
  edit : it was in cambodia , and it 's shaped like a fish because it 's a good luck symbol there . 
  ha , another idyllic wooden area i 've never heard about . 
  even though i know that 's a thing in finland it 's always surprising to see where in different places in finland still has these old wooden areas . 
  i really like them . 
  like there 's [ kaskinen ] ( http://wikitravel.org/upload/shared/c/c7/kaskinen_street.jpg ) , [ parainen ] ( http://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/static.panoramio.com/photos/original/75202061.jpg ) , [ loviisa ] ( https://kotoapoistuja.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/wp_20130711_005.jpg ) , [ reposaari ] ( http://static.panoramio.com/photos/original/78199267.jpg ) , [ port arthur ] ( http://www.vastavalo.fi/albums/userpics/19579/normal_131-189.jpg ) and so on . 
  as said in another comment , it is rather middle class , except if that would be in the capital region . 
  the capital region is notoriously expensive , but outside larger cities ( as this is ) , that 's fairly normal . 
  ilmatyynyalus = air pillow ship . 
  lentokone is not as direct as you said . 
  `` lento '' is * flight * , not * flying * . 
  but kone has a somewhat wider meaning than machine . 
  it 's like apparatus , appliance , device & machine all in one . 
  it 's like a general word for an artificial thing which does the task by itself . 
  computer for example is `` tietokone '' with `` tieto '' referring to information , data , so literally data-apparatus . 
  `` kodinkone '' is home appliance . 
  so `` lentokone '' = flight [ kone ] is not that different from english airplane . 
  [ here 's ] ( http://213.214.149.122/netcomm/imglib/9/264/kultarantavii.jpg ) the finnish presidential yacht operated by the finnish navy . 
  well , it 's not like finns want to socialize with other people any way . 
  i think he was referring to the fact that * vltava * is one letter short of * valtava * , which means `` huge '' in finnish . 
  why on earth would you need 10km empty radius ? 
   apparently the only missing factor to allow tree growth is water , so if we artificially provide that to kickstart the growth , the tree is able to continue living just fine afterwards . 
  and where do you get that water ? 
  from the local water table ? 
  it makes it even more difficult for the trees to establish themselves and reach the water table ( currently 30 meters underground ) then , as the water table decreases . 
  my point was that the climate itself is a problem if it prevents the kickstarting of growth . 
  you can not kickstart growth if the climate is simply unsuitable for it . 
  as a hyperbole , you can not say `` the climate of alaska is not a problem itself for tropical rainforests ** if ** you can get their growth kickstarted '' . 
  there 's a huge `` if '' there , and the if makes it conditional under for example climatic conditions . 
   if even a single tree can manage it all on its lonesome , then more trees will have an even easier time . 
  no , if that single tree is a remnant of different climate , and it had time to grow it roots 30 meters down to the water table , because the climate there did n't abruptly change . 
  new trees do n't grow 30 meter roots in a moment . 
  i had already forgotten but now you reminded me . 
  perhaps worth noting that russia is called * ven\u00e4j\u00e4 * in finnish and `` russians '' are * ven\u00e4l\u00e4iset * . 
  in estonian it 's * venemaa * , `` vene-land '' and russians in estonian is * venelased * , or `` vene people '' . 
  ( other countries mainly use the name `` russia '' which refers to people who row , and the area they came from , [ roslagen ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/roslagen ) in the eastern swedish coast . 
  accordingly , `` sweden '' in estonian is * rootsi * and in finnish * ruotsi * . ), 
  it was n't a straw man . 
  a straw man is attacking the claim other makes by presenting a twisted version of it an criticizing it . 
  i did n't claim you claimed anyone was a pedophile . 
  i was arguing that the logical structure of your assertion has rather interesting consequences , if the logical structure of your assertion is used in connotation with other suggestions , like suggestion someone is a pedophile . 
  it was a hyperbole demonstrating how silly the construction of your claim was . 
  you basically said `` we actually do n't know if it 's * not * x '' . 
  you can substitute x with a pedophile or russian puppet . 
  when you substitute x with russian puppet , we get your comment . 
  when we substitute x with a pedophile , we get a ridiculous accusation . 
  both operate on the same logic . 
  other examples : `` oh there 's a comet approaching earth ? 
  we actually do n't know if it 's * not * a spaceship . '', 
  `` oh an old wooden cup was found ? 
  we actually do n't know if it 's * not * the holy grail . '', 
  `` oh bernie sanders has russian heritage ? 
  we actually do n't know if he is * not * a plot of russia to undermine the us . '', 
  basically : making suggestive accusations like that is silly . 
  just because you are suspicious of something , it 's silly to use that kind of rhetoric where the starting point is that your suspicion is true , and the negation of your suspicion is presented as uncertain . 
  a more logical starting point would be that your suspicion unproven , and the positive claim you make is uncertain . 
  secondly , there is nothing suspicious that call to reduce military funding happens at the same time as some conflict . 
  the world is so large , populated by 200 countries and 7 billion people , that it 's bound to happen that during a conflict someone suggests the world funds less to weapons . 
  these suggestions to decrease military funding have happened all the time , even before the conflicts you refer to . 
  because these kinds of calls to reduce military spending happen all the time , some conflicts are bound to happen at the same time . 
  as a hyperbole , we can see that every time russia has been in some major conflict and there has been conflict in the middle east , the social democratic party of finland has been one of the largest parties in finland . 
  is this suspicious ? 
  no , because the social democratic party * has always * been one of the largest parties , so it being one of the largest parties is bound to happen at the same time some conflict . 
  well , i was talking about reforesting the sahara . 
  remnants of more suitable climates are n't a good indication of the desert to sustain future reforestation . 
  it 's normal for sahara to be a desert . 
  the tree you referred had roots going down over 30 meters . 
  something like that is impossible for new trees , as they do n't have water to grow like that . 
  but a tree which has started growing when water level was higher can slowly grow its roots deeper as the water level goes down . 
  we also do n't know you are not a pedophile . 
  does that mean it is reasonable to think or suspect you as one ? 
  so that kind of rhetoric * `` we do n't know god does not exist , so we must consider the possibility he exists '' * is silly . 
  any claim by anyone could be disputed with an unfounded claim * `` we do n't know he 's not part of a conspiracy '' * . 
  [ looks wicked ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/archive/9/90/20110420210207!saharan_dust_off_west_africa.jpg ) . 
  it is not known where they originated nor what language they spoke . 
  they also could be indigenous to central asia and eastern europe . 
  what insolence !, 
  what outrage !, 
  how can finns not have visa free travel to mongolia !, 
  uh , you 're not seeing the forest for the trees . 
  the point is that * reforestation * decreases co2 because a forest * as a whole * absorbs co2 . 
  no one claimed `` nothing in the forest releases co2 '' . 
  the point was that forest as a whole absorbs co2 and thus reduce atmospheric co2 and thus reforestation is good for the environment . 
  when the issue is reforestation it should be clear that what is meant is the ability of the forest as a whole to absorb co2 . 
  and actually it is not a no-brainer that amount of co2 in the atmosphere helps boost forest growth .

   but do n't act surprised when you keep sprouting racist bullshit then people flag you as such . 
  define racism then . 
  i mean you rant about racism all the time and calling the above user stormfront . 
  this is what you do all the time . 
  it just shows that you lack basic skills to make a point without filler nonsense or name calling . 
  it 's as if you seek some form of validation in your insecure person . 
  furthermore why do you change the subject to a previous discussion when there is now a question about your reaction to what / u/gingor said . 
  but to make it clear my opinion has always been that illegal immigrants should be locked up or sent back home . 
  even in one of my comments that the mods deleted i made it clear . 
  for all i care they can be locked up until they leave . 
  so once again it comes down to the person making an active choice , to be locked up or walk away free . 
  how is that racism . 
   the common tacit european agreement was that as long as immigrant do n't make waves , issues and become productive members of society we look the other way . 
  now exactly what agreement is that ? 
  either i 've missed some legally binding agreement and seriously need to call my representatives and ask what the hell they were thinking . 
  illegal immigrants are illegal and nothing more to it . 
   they 're ** probably ** not a `` free man '' where they come from . 
  assumptions and assumptions . 
  they were free enough to travel long distances to get to europe . 
  furthermore there are legal ways to ask for asylum which they decided not to follow . 
  ruining it for the ones that try to get to europe by following the laws . 
  what you are saying is that we should pat the ones breaking the rules on their back and say good job while telling the ones applying for asylum legally to go fuck themselves . 
  your views are deluded and based on some unsustainable concept of a fair world that will never exist . 
  the rest of your nonsense i do n't even need to address as it is just your attempt grab onto anything that would validate your opinion . 
   it 's stand on your post history around which sadly i ca n't really prove or quote here but you quite know about yourself enough since you apparently thought best to remove/hide . 
  once again nothing to hide here . 
  i 've said that muslim immigration is the biggest threat to european values of equality between genders , freedom of opinion , freedom of speech etc. 
  i 've said that illegal immigration should be stopped . 
  we should also stop organised crime from taking money from the poor and taking them on not seaworthy boats onto open seas . 
  to deter them from trying to come by sea i 've said that i support shooting at the boats . 
  i 've also said that the gypsy issue that has spread across western europe needs to be addressed . 
  no tell me what exactly there is racist . 
  there it is open for anyone to read . 
  so please come again . 
  you keep on seeing racism everywhere and your attempts to justify this are ludicrous and sad . 
  so please if you can not say anything but the same old yapping about racism , xenophobia and `` stormfront '' do n't say it at all because i do not care what you call me . 
  i 'd also dare to argue that non of the ones you call a racist care what you say . 
  instead you could try to have a debate discussing the actual issue but no , you just resort to the same old bull shit which leads nowhere . 
  it makes everyone reading what you have to say more stupid for having done so . 
   that my be one of my big fault to some degree , true . 
  at least we can agree on something . 
   the fact that i might fuck up does n't mean you are n't talking shit about immigrants constantly then acting like a `` surprised innocent '' . 
  define talking shit . 
  is it shit to want to discuss an issue just because you do n't like that it is being discussed . 
  no it is n't shit . 
  it comes straight back to what you just admitted , that what you are saying are poorly concocted opinions based on feelings . 
  i 'm done talking to you because talking to you is a waste of my and others time . 
  edit : typo, 
   if finland had a serious chance of quitting the eu , would you want an in/out referendum the same day as a general election . 
  yes to be honest . 
  more efficient that way . 
  answer my question . 
   what is it with you people advocating jail time for foreigners just for being foreigners then being surprised when people call you out on your blatant dictionary defined by the book plain old racism ? 
  breaking the law , which entering a country illegally is , should have consequences . 
  either you leave as a free man to where you came from , of you get locked up until you leave . 
  you still have all the power in the world to decide if you want to be locked up or not . 
  nothing racist about that what so ever . 
  it is pure common sense . 
  as with any other crime that has punishments to them who commit it . 
  your argument of it being racist has no logical ground to stand on . 
  it 's just some poorly concocted opinion base on feelings rather than common sense . 
  nothing more . 
  hmmm ... well i 'll let you be somewhat right . 
  i 'm still inclined to say that there could very well be a double vote during the general election . 
  i 'm of course not british so my opinion does n't really matter , 
  honestly would be interesting to see how well this correlates with unemployment . 
  i 'm fairly sure that the reason say spain is so high up is because people have time to be at home doing this . 
  that would mean that at least something good is coming out of this crisis . 
  in todays world i 'm amazed how they think censorship will ever work . 
  ok in countries like north korea where most people do n't even have a computer it works . 
  but just looking at china , it 's not like they are n't surfing the net as normal . 
   i do not believe it 's a coincidence that they resemble the nazi swastika so much . 
  it is n't . 
  at least i do n't get the impression that gd would actively hide it 's political opinions which lean very much towards national socialism . 
  what is it with you people that run around calling anyone that does n't think like you racists , xenophobic or stormfront ? 
  i mean are you seriously so bad at debating that the only thing you can do is this ? 
  mein kampf means nothing to be honest . 
  you can find it in any library and a lot of people have it . 
  hell we had to read it as part of political studies as well as the communist manifesto . 
  i have both at home and i 'm neither a national socialist or a communist . 
  it 's 2014 now so there 's more than enough time to have one in 2015 . 
  people do n't need 2.5 years to debate the issue . 
  the issue has in much been debated non stop on and off for years . 
  besides , does n't the scottish independence referendum only concern the scotts ? 
  i mean in the sense that only the scotts get to vote on it ? 
  edit : you could also do as in other countries to have two votes on the same day . 
  when you vote in the general elections you also vote on the eu . 
  once again the age old debate . 
  as i 've asked before , i 'll ask again . 
  at what point do we ask the question : how is it that one group is so universally hated in almost every country that has a significant minority of gypsies ? 
  is it really such a stretch to ask us this question . 
  as it is n't racist , it is a question that stands like a pink elephant in the room and needs to be addressed . 
  finland has its own gypsies and the problems are the exact same . 
  even if they are given housing , food , education , free healthcare and all social benefits they still are over represented in crime . 
  there 's only 10 000 of them in finland and they represent 20 % of all robberies committed in finland ( source : the national research institute of legal policy , rikollisuustilanne 2012 ) . 
  romanian nationals made up 13 % of the finnish prison population in 2011 . 
  in the same report it is explicitly stated that the big rise of romanian nationals in finnish prisons is linked to the rise of romanian gypsies . 
  romanian nationals are the third largest group of non finnish nationals in finnish prisons . 
  ( source : the national research institute of legal policy , rikollisuustilanne 2012 ) now this is just finland , and i am fairly confident in stating that the results are the same across europe . 
  in the case of finnish gypsies , the argument that they are neglected , and poor does not stand as they get the exact same social welfare benefits as any other finn and they are still over represented in crime compared to the size of their population .

  the eu treaties act as de facto laws , because the treaties say they act like laws and overrule national laws and ireland put their signature under the treaty and agreed to this . 
  eu is not forcibly overruling ireland . 
  ireland agreed to be overruled , when it joined eu . 
  if they do n't want eu interfering with ireland 's taxation and business practices , they should not have joined eu . 
  oh by the way it 's not 2018 anymore , well officially it is on paper still afaik . 
  however media here reports that unofficially pretty much everyone stuk , areva , tvo etc. 
  admit that it 's probably more like 2019-2020 range before it is in final operational state . 
  however apparently this time that date is so special , because unlike every other time this time it really really should hold . 
  assuming it passes stuk operational certification inspection and gets starting permission at all . 
  ( though it would be highly doubt full they would deny it . 
  it would be government topling level scandal , if after all this money and time it would not get production permission . 
  so even if it would be little faulty stuk would be under enormous pressure to give a go ahead once the plant is finally complete . 
  otherwise finland just spend 9 + billion for essentially nothing ) edit : oh and do n't worry we did n't learn our lesson . 
  there is now new project to by another nuclear plant . 
  however since areva is pretty much on black list , they are instead turning to the topic of this post , the trusty russian rosatomexport . 
  like that 's not gon na backfire just as badly . 
  but if the full facility design was completed 30 years ago the instrumentation design still in use is also probably 30 years old . 
  you do n't change stuff from a nuclear plant design on the fly . 
  it was designed to be safe with specific control system and design , so changing control system means major design check and overhaul . 
  they ca n't just switch the controls . 
  they have to check the whole design and how the new control would affect the facility and safety design . 
  methane spewing burning swamp . 
  yeah the fuck ups are little bit of a problem . 
  as a finn it is funny to follow the uber optimistic nuclear comments while following the 3x budget 3x schedule mess that is areva and olkiluoto 3 . 
  everybody goes on and on how nuclear is so safe , if one just does it right . 
  they should know these are being build by the lowest bidder construction crews . 
  what ever the nuclear company promises for delivery , their numbers times 2x is a realistic starting point . 
  the problem is due to safety margins , the enormous complexity and rarity of the building projects nuclear power plants almost never complete in budget and on time . 
  many many times the projects are massively delayed . 
  simple facts is construction crews are not used to nuclear style building and fuck up all the time . 
  heck they literally cast the olkiluoto 3 concrete base plate wrong . 
  workers think the can do like with other plants and projects , adapt here and there , maybe think on ttheir feet little bit , maybe cut corner slightly there , do it a faster way that looks obvious here etc. 
  but that stuff does n't fly with nuclear plant . 
  safety margins do n't allow it and whole safety design relies on the plant being built exactly as drawn and not just about like it . 
  there obviously faster way is not possible for specific reason , you ca n't cut even that one weld and you absolutely do not adapt and think on the job . 
  almost every single thing is as it is for a reason down the way each specific weld and joint is done . 
  our only saving grace here in finland is that our nuclear safety agency is on the ball and is n't afraid to step on toes . 
  it came as great shock to areva , that stuk actually wanted to see blueprints , designs and inspect the building phases and good that they did . 
  otherwise that mountain of plant would have exploded on first start . 
  now it 's ten years late , but at least it wo n't go immediately kaboom due to idiot construction workers thinking it is okay to cut their own pipe pass through in the containment shielding . 
  you know it is faster than having to route the pipes all the way around it . 
  i only trust clearly non earth biased broadcasts from iss . 
  none of these earthly rubbish . 
  yes it should be and is illegal , if usa in pursuance of this goal uses methods or conducts that break usa law . 
  for example using torture to get information . 
  also if said conduct breaks international treaties usa has ratified . 
  again also torture . 
  of course usa does n't have to care about breaking the target countries laws ( the whole point of espionage ) , but then should not be surprised of the consequences in getting caught with hand in the cookie jar like agents getting killed in nastier countries or very very very frosty diplomatic relations with supposed allies . 
  like wise counter action should be expected like brazil building a new optical cable to europe to bypass usa or many countries not trusting equipment from usa suppliers for critical equipment . 
  stupid to replace them . 
  adding cell phone alerts is okay , but nothing can beat the reliability of a warning siren . 
  well even after getting past the entrance test , it 's still a 2,5 year training program . 
  so one ca n't exactly do it on a whim and one certainly ai n't going to last through the training without being fit . 
  the long training is a test in itself . 
  assuming one gets one build ready in the first place . 
  ahemmm ... olkiluoto ahemmm ... . . whatever the power company says is the timetable and budget , multiply both with 3 and you have a realistic first estimate . 
  tow boat back to africa ? 
  and what happens when said coast nation navy intercepts and threatens to sink said towing vehicle . 
  you ca n't just randomly tow boats to random nations . 
  the `` close the borders '' is a fancy fantasy when a ) already an european prison camp ( not to mention prison camps are expensive ) is a heaven compared to food situation back home . 
  b ) you also ca n't deport people randomly you need treaties with the home countries ( or are you going to parachute the people back from a military stealth transport ) . 
  home countries with no interest to take the extra burden of the people already having left the country . 
  plus again people would try again simply because the base level of the average living standard is higher . 
  ergo to really close borders in any significa n't way borders guards have to start to shoot people . 
  then the survival instinct will kick in for sure, 
  you do realize to close the borders , you have to start to shoot people at the border . 
  these people are already risking a near certain death on the boat trip . 
  so only thing to motivate them to stop , over a near certain death , is a certain death . 
  meaning border guards shoot anyone illegally crossing the border on sight . 
  or coast guard mows down the boats in the sea . 
  otherwise the people keep coming and keep cutting the fence or ramming the beach . 
  or to put it bluntly a mass migration movement has started , deal with it , because there is no stopping it . 
  partly this happened due to climate reasons , partly political . 
  in the end the reason is of no importance , suffice to say it is out of the hands of the eu . 
  simply put there is no stopping this . 
  it is n't a matter of if people keep coming , but a matter of how to deal with it . 
  this is first calls of the big climate migrations coming due to climate change , so if you think this is bad , just wait couple decades . 
  then options are a ) massive prison camps ( costly and helps no one ) b ) deportation ( not possible in large enough quantities , plus people would just try again ) c ) integration ( costly , but somewhat beneficial in the end ) d ) lots of bullets ( do i have to spell out why this option is not an option ) . 
  more specifically abide by the rules they have no say over . 
  so considering one main brexit argument is brussels meddling with things , i do n't think uk brexiters are willing to do a norway . 
  you are mixing ecj and european court of human rights . 
  european court of justice is the eu court . 
  echr is the council court , but is pretty much the last stop court in eu since all of eu is in the council . 
  also echr gets it 's powers from european convention of human rights , which is pretty much the base constitution of all of eu and as a human rights convention over rules any other law , constitution or treaty . 
  whatever echr orders is the law , since though it ca n't make law it 's orders are legally binding to the nation and must be followed . 
  theoretically rest of the council nations are treaty bound to pretty much use any means necessary to make sure the offending nation follows echr court rulings and implements them . 
  edit : so in brexit uk would not necessarily have to follow ecj , but echr will continue to make their politicians lives hell and uk continues to try to ignore echr even existing . 
  only way out of echr is to shred their promise and membership to european convention of human rights . 
  i 'm pretty sure uk is not crazy enough to shred a human rights treaty signature . 
  apparently you have n't heard of puppet governments . 
  usa do n't need to annex the countries . 
  they already get all the benefits without the hassle of spending all the diplo points on the chess board for full annexation . 
  because frankly a chess board game it is to usa leadership . 
  usa has a long long history of using puppets and pet dictators cuba ( back fired badly ) , iran ( back fired badly ) , guatemala , pretty much whole south america ( at one point or another in the history ) ... ... ... 
  so usa has an empire , it is just organized differently than a traditional empire . 
  oh no nato and it 's mean runner usa are much more flexible . 
  they do n't bother invading countries bordering it . 
  instead they invade countries on the other side of the world . 
  are russians fucks . 
  yeah , but it does n't remove the fact that usa are fucks also just little bit different kind of fucks .

  at least this is n't a job that belongs to the foreign minister !, 
  corruption is a funny thing . 
  when you 're employed by an company seeking to expand into a new country , you must adapt your local branch into the local culture , otherwise it will fail . 
  it 's very easy to think a situation where a foreign company , with high-road executive at the lead enters a corrupt country . 
  he has a great product , surely the government will buy it !, 
  what more , your superiors back in the homeland know that you have a superior product . 
  if you fail to make the deal , you 're clearly incompetent and should find some other line of work . 
  now , he goes to meet the minister , who agrees that the product is superb , far better than the competitors . 
  but he wo n't buy it without some greasing . 
  will the executive choose between the payoff , keeping his highly-paying job . . or will he take the high-road and brush up his cv ? 
  that 's corruption . 
  once it gets a foothold , it spreads . 
  and there 's always corruption . 
  not only in finnish companies at romania , but in finnish companies at finland . 
  we must always be vigilant , stamp it down , to keep it guessing . 
  we must prosecute the executives in their homecountries , even if their host countries do n't . 
  if it gets too organised , it becomes an unwritten law . 
  if we accept that there 's corruption in romania , that it 's `` only '' degrees worse than our own , then we 're already lost . 
  once a product is judged to have a monopoly , the rules change . 
  so do laws . 
  with what do you eat the m\u00fcsli ? 
  sourmilk , milk ( 0 % , 1 % , 4 % ) , yogurt ? 
   this has nothing to do with whether taxes are used to pay for it or not ( they are n't ) . 
  yeah , but you also talked about roads . 
  which are rather expensive . 
   because , as everyone knows , telephone services can only be provided with copper cables . 
  do you happen to have even a vague idea how mobile telephone network works ? 
  hint ; the `` wireless '' part is just till the nearest antenna . 
  after that , it relies on copper cables . 
  the situation is relatively good in finland/sweden , but for example in many parts of us you can only get one cable company offering internet . 
  because , you know , natural monopoly . 
  of the four or five operators national operators , two service my ( highly populated ) area , and only two can offer service . 
  and this is after laws making sharing those wires mandatory . 
   today , we have private telecom companies providing high quality worldwide video telephony services for free ( e.g. 
  skype also relies on copper wiring . 
  you are paying for the copper wiring in the cable/dsl ; skype might offer free calls , but it 's still a business and it does bill people . 
  and true , life is easier . 
  i do remember what it was like making international calls 20 years ago . 
   does it or does it not fall out of the sky for free ? 
  it does , at that !, 
  there 's also a lot in lakes , most of it even drinkable . 
  but the thing is , it does n't rain all the time and i do n't live next to a lake . 
  there 's a free water post outside , but carrying water in and storing it is n't half as convenient as opening tab and drinking directly from it . 
  we did that hundred years ago ( and that 's why there 's that water post outside ) , but there 's a reason why we do n't use it anymore . 
  chemical water purification at the end-point is n't , for limitations of space , half as efficient and the results are n't half as good as doing it centrally ( you know , economies of scale ) . 
  but this is n't really the point . 
  the point is that creating the piping and making the water flow through them is really expensive undertaking . 
  and i 'm quoting wikipedia now ;  a natural monopoly by contrast is a condition on the cost-technology of an industry whereby it is most efficient ( involving the lowest long-run average cost ) for production to be concentrated in a single firm . 
  in some cases , this gives the largest supplier in an industry , often the first supplier in a market , an overwhelming cost advantage over other actual and potential competitors . 
  this tends to be the case in industries where capital costs predominate , creating economies of scale that are large in relation to the size of the market , and hence high barriers to entry ; ** examples include public utilities such as water services . 
  ** the quality of water is just a nice perk . 
  they can offer clean water , the best in the world , so why should n't they ? 
  the raw material is plenty good already , it 's cheap to provide ( also , this is a point of pride ) . 
  also there 's something to be said for water that does n't make you sick if accidentally digested . 
   a large percentage of your tax money goes towards paying for wars . 
  if you disagree with those wars on ethical grounds ... sweden ( and please note that i have a finnish flag next to my name ) has n't been in war for 200 years . 
  military ( peacekeeping ) operations in both of these countries tend to have good support from population and i do n't believe we 've been thought as invaders in operation countries either ( before making the mistake of going to afganistan , where we are mixed up with americans ) . 
  we have n't fought any vietnams . 
  finland still has conscription , but only professional soldiers get to volunteer to leave for peacekeeping . 
  there have been talks about if conscription is necessary , but we also had these talks in 1930s , which did n't really end that well for us ( you know , soviet invasion , having to ally with nazis for want of guns and ammo etc ) . 
  the finnish past is a big reason for how sweden has handled their defence as well . 
  the tl ; dr is that conscription is just a tax among many . 
  it 's not ideal , but there are n't any alternatives . 
  nowadays sweden has a professional army . 
  finland does n't . 
  seeing as how russian media still talks about `` taking finland '' or more subtly `` russian laws trumping finnish on finnish ground '' , there 's a good reason for this . 
  that end-user waterfilter is meant for temporal emergency use in developing countries . 
  the cost-per-litre was several times higher with worse quality than dedicated plant . 
   water is not a natural monopoly . 
  in sweden , you get most of it coming out of the sky , and spread relatively evenly accross all rooftops , in the form of rain . 
  the technology for purifying this water is n't a natural monopoly either . 
  water companies are the definition of natural monopoly . 
  it 's the very dictionary definition . 
  it 's also mentioned in the wikipedia article near the top , i see . 
   it costs a lot more if you 're going to be running 90 % of drinking water down your toilet , in your shower , in your dishwasher and in your washing machine . 
  i rather wash my teeth , bathe , drink , clean my clothes and do my dishes with clean water . 
  if you want to do that in brown goo , be my guest . 
   that 's because it has been heavily subsidised by your taxes , . . 
  it is n't . 
  again , natural monopolies ( and their infrastructure ) are expensive to build and cheap to maintain . 
   which is exactly what this advert is about . 
  the advert is about everything that taxes do . 
  they built the waterworks and now they fund the regulators that keep the quality good . 
  not only for water companies , but also what you can put into lakes etc. 
  further , even britain who has privatised water heavily regulates the field . 
  but i did n't create the advert , so this would be only my view on the subject   ellinen , if you 're happy to pay half your salary ... more like third , but ok .  to run drinking water down your toilet well , water is one of those few resources we have plenty . 
  that being said , the toilets do have two settings to address this problem at least partially . 
   . . and a few unethical wars on the other side of the planet . . 
   feel free to stay in sweden and continue exactly as you have been . 
  thanks . 
  hope you love wherever you are . 
   why create a state-enforced monopoly on the regulatory system ? 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/natural_monopoly  purifying water to drinking standard at the distribution source is a huge misallocation of resources . . do you know how much or little does it cost to purify water to be drinkable ? 
   which is why no state-owned water company has ever been self-sustainable . 
  again , i refer to article on natural monopolies . 
  however , the waterworks at sweden ( and finland ) are state-owned ( as they are in most eu-countries ) , the water is ranked to be better than most bottled springwaters . 
  it also does n't cost much . 
  the above poster is n't too familiar with the local situation . 
  please ignore him . 
  the water company is regulated by government ( and often owned by the county outright ) .

i find that most fancy cheeses taste bad . 
  might as well smuggle a cheese that someone can actually eat . 
  same with some fancy french wine , costs a lot but tastes dry and bland . 
  russia is sanctioned by the eu because of the crimea . 
  russia makes bad cheese . 
  eu countries ca n't sell their cheese to russia , so it has to be smuggled in . 
  that does n't tell us who is funding them . 
  if i went to the market and held up a sign saying `` long live trump '' does that mean trump is funding me ? 
  i would n't be thankful at all . 
  russia is an important trade partner of finland , losing them would be quite bad for our economy . 
  he 's thinking about how sipil\u00e4 will fuck-up finland while he 's away . 
  you would get daily beatings from germany , reminding you to not disobey ever again . 
  hopefully not . 
  they should have never come to europe . 
  the eu should have funded refugee centers in turkey and egypt . 
  you 're not getting my point so there 's no reason to continue . 
  yes so context . 
  in a geography subreddit you 'd use fennoscandia and scandinavian peninsuala etc , but / r/europe is n't about geography . 
  it 's more about culture , history and politics . 
  and in that context finland and iceland are very much scandinavian . 
  in regular conversation the terms are used interchangeably . 
  finland/iceland being/not being scandinavian depends on the context . 
  it 's wrong in geographical terms but in cultural it 's not . 
  sweden and finland we 're together for 750 continuous years . 
  if that qualifies as `` long shared history '' . 
  finland 's 2nd official language is swedish . 
  i 'd also include iceland in the list . 
  at least in my experience people use scandinavia and nordic interchangeably . 
  kinda like holland/netherlands or england/united kingdom . 
  not wanting to leave their ancestral lands ? 
  the government and it 's actions are supposed to represent the common people . 
  same reason why we say `` police '' and not `` the people who stop people who break the law '' . 
  it 's shorter and simpler . 
  everyone knows what it means . 
  i wonder why you got downvoted , only a very small part of turkey is in europe . 
  the vast majority of their population and land is in asia . 
  well i 'd like to see you try prohibit alcohol . 
  we 've tried it before , did n't work . 
  why legalize cannabis and add to our problems ? 
  it 's so nice to see someone who agrees with you on such an important topic . 
  they 'd be on the top of the hdi if they outlawed it . 
  good way to take things way out of context . 
  you know full well that finland had a serious economic crisis in the early 90s caused by bad policy , not alcohol . 
  so because we have 1 murderer we might as well have 10 more ? 
  because serious problems take a long time to appear . 
  semantics . 
  it 's illegal because it 's dangerous . 
  then recognize the authority of the state . 
  hard drugs are illegal for a reason . 
  no i have n't , nor am i planning to . 
  i believe we need to eliminate it , not endorse it . 
  but i have no interest in talking to an anarchist . 
  good day . 
  the high is the negative effect . 
  with alcohol you have to drink a lot to get even similar effects to weed . 
  weed causes hallucinations , delusions , and a loss of the sense of personal identity . 
  dangerous . 
  you wo n't get cancer from a single tobacco , you wo n't get liver disease from a can of beer and you wo n't get heart failure from one burger . 
  but the negative effects of hard drugs happen instantly . 
  and that 's why it 's dangerous . 
  i 'm pretty sure i 'm not . 
  i 'm against hard drugs like cannabis , heroin and lsd . 
  and i 'm not sorry for it . 
  i 'm also against tobacco , but not as much . 
  however , you wo n't get your mind altered mcdonalds causing you to hurt someone or yourself . 
  if you think mcdonalds is as dangerous as weed then you 're an idiot . 
  you need to drink a lot of alcohol for the negative effects to appear . 
  while weed is dangerous even in small amounts . 
  right ... good luck with that . 
  alcohol has been a part of culture for thousands of years . 
  i think it 's fine . 
  america is in a downward spiral regardless and uruguay is a ` shithole ' already . 
  not much we can do to help them . 
   i think most of people would n't risk for `` 5 bucks '' or some other amount a teenager can offer . 
  but druggies would . 
  they could use that 5 $ to buy some for themselves . 
  legalizing drugs would be accepting defeat and throwing the children 's future away . 
  unacceptable . 
  the effects of marijuana can be felt in small amounts , according to the article . 
  have a cup of coffee and see if you start feeling murderous . 
  i think you wo n't . 
  i asked for users , user means someone who is doing something currently . 
  bill gates used lsd when he was in his twenties , not now . 
  his id , the time and amount are documented , great . 
  now what is stopping him from handing the drugs to the teenager ? 
  no he did kill his wife , and was sentenced to 30 years in prison . 
  & nbsp ;  it is my opinion that this disorder was the direct result of psychosis due to severe insomnia . 
   by sleep deprivation , which was caused by the heavy ingestion of diet pills ** and ** caffeine we do n't know what pills these were and how they react in the body with each other . 
  could happen with any two substances . 
  it 's from the article you linked . 
  did you even read it ? 
  i have a problem with excessive consumption of alcohol . 
  oh really ? 
  you think a rebellious teenager wo n't find a way to say , pay an adult 5 $ to buy him some weed ? 
  cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome . 
  the symptoms are severe abdominal pain and violent vomiting . 
  lovely . 
   a denver man who is accused of killing his wife after eating marijuana-infused candy he bought at a legal pot shop has pleaded not guilty to first-degree murder . 
  bill gates is not an lsd user . 
  he has n't used it for a long time .

  the most reliable theory is that the name derives from finno-ugric moska tribe who lived along the moskva river . 
  their main settlement was named moskova which suggest some connections to karelia and tshuudis . 
  one theory suggests that the source of the name is an ancient finnic language , in which it means `` dark '' and `` turbid . '', 
  alternatively , the name may come from the finno-permic komi language , meaning `` cow-river '' or from the finno-volgaic mordovian language , meaning `` bear-river '' . 
  in tatar-turkic languages this wooden finno-ugrian settlement was also called moskova . '', 
  http://www.newworldencyclopedia.org/entry/moscow#name ( in finnish , bear-river is karhujoki and cow-river is lehm\u00e4joki . 
  dark is tumma , synkk\u00e4 and turbid is samea , haalea , sakea . ), 
  most of the names are just modified versions of the original pronounced names with changes to accommodate finnish language : no consonant clusters in the beginning , less foreign letters ( b , c , e , f , q , x , z , \u00e5 ) and names end in vowels . 
  for example `` france '' sounds about `` frans '' to finnish speakers . 
  drop the foreign letter and consonant cluster in the beginning , ad a vowel to the end -  ranska . 
  iceland in nearby languages is pronounced to finnish ear like `` islant '' , ad a vowel to the end -  islanti . 
  for the rest , collected explanations from this thread expanded : alankomaat ( netherlands ) = ` alanko ' means ' a lowland ' , ` maa ' means ' a land ' or ' a country ' . 
  ` maat ' is the plural nominative of the word ` maa ' . 
  so literally , ` lowland lands ' -- netherlands . 
  iso-britannia ( great britain ) = big britain , though the actual name united kingdom is * yhdistynyt kuningaskunta * , a literal translation of united kingdom . 
  it\u00e4valta ( austria ) = east power ruotsi ( sweden ) = from old swedish * ro\u00fes - ( `` related to rowing '' ) , probably from roslagen where finns and swedes supposedly first met . 
  it further derives from proto-germanic * r\u014dan\u0105 ( `` to row '' ) , ultimately from proto-indo-european * h \u2081 reh \u2081 - ( also meaning `` to row '' ) . 
  of the same origin is also the finnish ryss\u00e4 , a pejorative for russians . 
  saksa ( germany ) = from the german area saxony . 
  ven\u00e4j\u00e4 ( russia ) = from proto-germanic * wene\u0111 - ( `` slav '' ) . 
  it relates to the wends , a historical name given by germanic peoples to slavs living near them , itself originating from latin veneti . 
  this was a name given by the greeks and romans to tribes living along the river vistula as well as those in north-eastern italy , in the area now known as venice/veneto ( venetia ; you can see the connection ) . 
  valko-ven\u00e4j\u00e4 ( belarus ) = translates to white-russia . 
  viro ( estonia ) = from the north estonian region by the name of virumaa . 
  edit : on the pronounciation as a source for names . 
  edit 2 : [ i was wrong on the case of france ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/41845h/country_names_in_finnish/cz0olfx ) , though in general finnish has the tendency to finnish words in that way .

  merely posting a link without any arguments of its relevancy here does n't contribute to anything . 
  while for western far right nationalism the unifying factor tends to be heritage , ethnicity , `` race '' , for radical muslims it 's religion . 
  radical muslims do tend desire a geographic territory where their religion would unify people . 
  that 's the reason the us foreign policy in middle east is seen invasive by many muslims . 
  it 's the us invading the muslim world , which according to radical muslims should be an unified nation under allah . 
  from western perspective this is not that evident , as we tend to see nationalism equating to nation-state , but for radical islam , the nation is n't that much about the population of a certain de jure state , but about people of certain religion . 
  for example isis or saudi-arabia both unify their people in a certain geographic territory , not through ethnic nationalism like western far right does , but through religion . 
  the radical islam view is a nation united by religion . 
  radical islamism exists outside the western political map , as the western political map is n't universal , but merely descriptive of the western political world . 
  but if one were to place radical islamism on the western political map , it would be most close to the western far right . 
  thus in a discussion like this it 's pretty understandable to say radicali islamists are the arab far right as an analogue , kind of like one can say '' ______ is the machiavelli of poland '' . 
  that 's not a literal claim some person is the actual machiavelli , but rhetoric tool to point out how similar someone is to the actual machiavelli . 
  yea , most of those can be said about the ussr , but not all of them , making radical islamism closer to far right than far left . 
  and when it comes to far right and far left , i also believe in the [ horseshoe theory ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bc/political_spectrum_horseshoe_model.svg/1280px-political_spectrum_horseshoe_model.svg.png ) , that radical ends of the left-right spectrum end up being more similar to each other than the center of the political spectrum . 
  uh , those old ladies are like lady gaga aged 70 . 
  but in their ideology they have strong similarities with far right : strong authoritarian state which upholds and forces the people to follow an ideology of national unity , sees some people as inherently inferior to their own and which is also used to trample civil liberties , and is used to uphold and justify strong traditional hierarchy and conservative values in the system . 
  that 's a surprisingly high percentage . 
  alcoholic people sleeping on park benches is a vastly more common problem than homeless people sleeping in benches in finland . 
  helsinki has fairly good shelters for homeless people so they rarely have to sleep around , and when they do , they do n't do it next to the busiest street in helsinki in the front yard of the parliament building , where that photo is taken from . 
  yea , it 's sad . 
  also worth considering is that those linked benches are in the front yard of the parliament building extension in the very center of helsinki , in a so called `` parade place '' . 
  the wind is blowing from right to left too . 
  this is already done in finland at least . 
  they study the dialects of the applicants , they ask details about their purported origin like `` if you are from this district of this city , describe what it looks like '' and `` what was the weather like when you left '' and so on . 
  killed by religion without the help of people , or killed by people following the religion ? 
  the belief system only exist because people believe in it and uphold it . 
  religion does not exist without people upholding it . 
  religion exists as people who follow it . 
  comparison to nazis is not a good one . 
  `` german '' is not a synonym to adherent of nazi ideology . 
  merkel is german , but does not adhere to nazi ideology . 
  but muslim means adherent to islamic religion . 
  by definition someone following islamic religion is a muslim , and muslim follows islamic religion . 
  though being muslim is not something you are only playing . 
  it does n't operate like a game , so game metaphors do n't apply . 
  modern islam = the contemporary islamic religion with all it 's variations , including jihadists . 
  what is modern islam if not the people who adhere to it ? 
  elections tell how well the voters think the ruling parties have handled issues . 
  they are not a measure of how well the issues actually were handled . 
  yes , it 's nice when people think it is [ okay for individuals to murder other people if it 's done `` for the right cause '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/november_2015_paris_attacks ) . 
  something good from the yellow press : in finland they introduced the term `` seksihelle '' , * sex heat * after writing an article about someone having sex in a park during a summer heat wave . 
  now summer heat waves are sometimes colloquially referred as * sex heats * , which imo is ridiculously awesome word . 
  i think the difference from +4 to -6 feels greater than from -6 to -30 . 
  i mean , after freezing temperature it 's all pain and nuisance anyway . 
  the weather of finland is more strongly influenced by the continental weather of russia , so the continental hard winter weather sometimes spills to finland . 
  then the yellow press has headlines like `` siberian chaos blizzard invades finland '' or something targeted to microrussophobia in finnish readers . 
  that 's because the roaming ban is n't in force yet . 
  the linked article says it will come in force june 2017 . 
   an independent constitutional court i 'd note that many countries do n't have a constitutional court at all , for example the nordic countries all lack a constitutional court . 
  not just your every day child pornography , but golden shower child pornography !, 
  but does n't this specifically ban selling packages that are more expensive to use abroad than in the native country ? 
  and i also doubt that it 's legal to sell packages that do n't work in other countries , as that would be discrimination based on country . 
  for example if i buy a computer from germany to finland , they can not charge me extra price for the computer just because i live in finland or make it so that the computer does n't work in finland . 
  the point with roaming removal is to make the phone and data markets also single market like this , and that the market is truly one market and i can buy a mobile packet from the country where it is the cheapest , and i pay the same price as the people in that country . 
  thanks , dad .

   some expect that being gay is kind of universal , global thing and homosexual relationships are to be introduced in every other country on their conditions .

  we can build huge pumps which pump rising water away from the oceans . 
  this stream of water can be funneled to hydroelectric power plants which are then used to power the pumps . 
  deviant weather happens even without climate change . 
  climate is the average of weather , so an individual deviant weather can not really be attributed easily to climate change , but the statistical number of total deviant weather events can be . 
  it 's like throwing a mildly loaded dice . 
  the statistically most likely distribution for a normal dice would be 10 throws out of 60 being sixes . 
  but with a loaded dice out of 60 throws , 40 are sixes . 
  it can be then said the total number of sixes was caused by the weight , but is is much harder , if impossible to say which individual six was caused by the weight .

  it does n't maximize the overall benefit and should not be at least fully embraced by the state .

  it 's not far from the methods used by religious groups . 
   nope . 
  while afaik no gmo is proven toxic , every ge plant is different , even if you prove one is n't toxic in any way , it does n't say anything about other/future ge products .

  should we ban those too beforehand ? 
  i did n't remember the size of it but yes , i remembered that the uk is running trade deficit . 
  trade deficit is a problem but creating trade obstacles is worse , because while it can boost internal markets , it typically means more expensive and inferior products that are not competitive . 
  also typically these works both ways as well meaning that the access of british products to eu markets would become much harder as well . 
  not getting eu benefits should n't be a surprise if you leave eu :d one part of eu is that it 's one of the most complex trade deal ever made with contains a lot of integration of the markets which is depends on supranational rulings .

  you seem to assume only mere ignorance of those is the cause here .

  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3ckc9m/cider_consumption_soars_in_poland_despite_a/ ), 
  yes , depending on time frame some slavic peoples were victims , some perpetrators and some both . 
  in the slave trade networks the raiders , transporters , traders and end-clients were often different and who they were changed over time . 
  depending on the time period there were for example varangians , tatars , muscovites and russians making raids to finland and karelia capturing people into slavery , and transporting them to be sold for example on the slave markets of the crimean khanate , from where they ended up to the ottoman empire and middle east and to the other khanates in the east . 
  as late as during the great northern war ( 1700 -- 1721 ) russia invaded and occupied finland , and russians unleashed a reign of terror known as the great wrath ( 1713 -- 1721 ) during which tens of thousands finns were murdered or taken away as slaves . 
   we ca n't talk about the millions of europeans who were enslaved by muslim countries . 
  incidentally , in that slave trade the most high-priced slaves were young blond girls captured from finland and karelia . 
  here 's a well-researched and well-sourced article about that : [ blonde cargoes : finnish children in the slave markets of medieval crimea ] ( http://mikedashhistory.com/2015/01/15/blonde-cargoes-finnish-children-in-the-slave-markets-of-medieval-crimea/ ) yet only few know about all that and there are some who want to believe that also finns have to carry the white man 's guilt including over institutionalized slavery when in fact finns actually were victims of it . 
   when a certain culture is hostile to facts , what does that say about it ? 
  a very relevant article : [ why some of the worst attacks on social science have come from liberals ] ( http://nymag.com/scienceofus/2015/12/when-liberals-attack-social-science.html?mid=fb-share-scienceofus ) and it 's not only hostility to facts but also hostility to science itself freely exploring ideas and researching facts , and even going as far as forming slanderous personal witch hunts of scientists . 
  just for one example , the way biochemist and nobel laureate timothy hunt was forced to resign from his positions after the lies about him making * a joke * in his toast speech . 
  lies which were published by the leftist paper guardian contributing to the misguided witch hunt and to the on-line feminist hate mob 's two minutes of hate : [ the timothy hunt witch hunt ] ( https://www.commentarymagazine.com/articles/the-timothy-hunt-witch-hunt/ ), 
  yup . 
  we do n't have proper mountains in finland but [ fells . 
  ] ( http://www.nic.fi/~yllrasti/tunturi2004.jpg ) that 's because of their age . 
  they formed about 1.8-1 .9 bn years ago , used to be high mountains , but over ages they have gone through many ice ages and stuff eroding them to fells . 
  the mountain range [ scandes ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/scandinavian_mountains ) in norway and sweden formed about 400-425 mn years ago , so those mountains have n't experienced as much erosion . 
  only a small part in [ finland 's arm extends to the scandes .

  pick your poison with the help of the blog above , he has tried almost everything . 
  also , why not celebrate the new year 's eve nordic style : http://www.salmiyuck.com/2010/10/ruining-perfectly-good-bottle-of-vodka.html, 
   how do you even eat salmiaki ? 
  you bravely put it in your mouth , do n't immediately succumb to the pain , and then write hilarious blogposts about your experiences : http://www.salmiyuck.com/search/label/caustic  the tulien salmiakki started off like a normal hard candy : mostly flavorless with a touch of sweet . 
  that 's also a troubling sign for salmiac . 
   with a minute , i was overcome with a unique sensation , almost like that of an impending sneeze . 
  as i continued `` enjoying '' this candy , a numbness started spreading throughout my mouth . 
  that was followed by a slight tingling sensation . 
  this is not the experience i 'd expect from candy ... which is yet another troubling sign . 
   things went downhill quickly . 
  my entire tongue went numb ( yet , somehow started hurting ) , and the tingling sensation started spreading . 
  in the exact opposite manner that menthol clears the sinuses , the tulien led to a difficulty breathing . 
  the numbing pain spread to my gums , teeth , and , well , just about everywhere else . 
   and then i bit down . 
  whatever unholy substance was amalgamated into this candy 's outershell was in its purist form in the center . 
  pain does n't even begin to describe what that sensation was like . 
  or gay-islamist-fascists, 
  well , just saying what it is . 
  in the us they have the second amendmend where owning and bearing firearms is defined as a right . 
  i do n't know of any eu country that has similar constitution . 
  instead owning firearms is regulated and licensed : you do n't have a right to own a firearm you need a permission first , which makes it a privilege not a right . 
   i support gun rights you american ? 
  we do n't have gun rights in europe , or at least i do n't know of an eu country that does . 
  generally over here owning a firearm is not a * right * but you need a licence and stuff . 
  heh , in helsinki the tap water has the final seal of approval of * trouts * rendering their service for over million people . 
  the water is taken from a large lake and flows by gravity through a 120 kilometer long tunnel in the bedrock ( [ the second longest tunnel in the world ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/p%c3%a4ij%c3%a4nne_water_tunnel ) ) . 
  it 's already drinkable when taken form the lake , but get 's sampled , treated , analyzed and monitored as per usual . 
  and then there 's the trout test . 
  trouts are good for the job because they 're cool , laidback sort of guys and yet they have very acute senses and are very sensitive . 
  as migrating fishes they react to tiniest changes in the water . 
  their breathing , heartbeat and behavior is monitored , and if there 's anything amiss , which other tests have n't caught , or if the water tastes even a tiny bit of funny to them they will alarm . 
  i may be drunk but i 'm already home . 
  as per your comments i have learned to know you as a redditor who is well versed in history including military history . 
  just wanted to ask you about something i 've been wondering for a long time : given that finns fought both the soviets and the germans in the wwii do you know if any military historians have looked into the finnish experience of how it was different ? 
  i mean , i have read quite a bunch of finnish unit histories and memoirs and stuff , all in finnish , and those who did experience fighting both the soviets and the germans do mention some differences . 
  but do you know if someone has actually studied that perspective and published on it ? 
  but having islamist terrorists running wild in fort boyard would make the tv-show much more exciting . 
  russia you 're drunk go home . 
   well , arent most school massacres in the eu done with semi-automatic weapons ? 
  the last one was with a sword . 
  let 's ban swords . 
   i do n't see any reason why they should be legal you do n't need to yell . 
  here 's just some examples of perfectly legitimate uses : * national defence . 
  training shooting skills in reserve is important . 
  * hunting . 
  not all hunting requires semi-autos but it is often better . 
  * sports . 
  many shooting sports use semi-autos . 
  * pest control . 
  a semi-auto beats manual hands down when shooting rats or other pests . 
  * hobby . 
  people do shooting as a hobby using semi-autos . 
   you have 1 fucking shot to kill that moose , if you miss , the moose will run away and you are screwed and with a fucking musket the moose is screwed too running around with its guts falling out and all . 
   but this is just my personal view of the subject yup . 
  i can tell you 're an expert . 
   the fact is that this law has been prepared for quite a while , so they used the latest terrorist attack to be able to pass it through with minimal opposition .

  look at [ this ] ( https://www.reproductiverights.org/sites/crr.civicactions.net/files/documents/abortionmap2014.pdf ) map to see how well ireland fits in with other western countries , to which it belongs in every single aspect you can think of . 
  criticizing their laws is not unfair , what really is `` unfair '' ( to put it mildly ) is that ireland has outsourced their abortion policies to the uk forcing thousands of women to travel there each year . 
  abortion is happening in ireland , just not on the irish soil , and there is no excuses for that kind of hypocrisy and cruelty . 
   could not agree if you could n't agree more with this , you could n't agree more with the fact that in ireland the only way of having an abortion is for a doctor to decide the pregnancy is a danger to the woman 's life . 
  not health , _ life _ . 
  otherwise abortion is completely illegal , in every single reason you can think . 
  so are you sure you could n't agree more ? 
  because then you are agreeing with their abortion laws and the fact that in ireland someone else than the pregnant mother herself are seen as the more capable to decide if that woman wants or can to have a child ? 
  there does n't exist any kind of profession in this world where a person would know better than you if you can or want to make the biggest choice of your life . 
  whether someone needs a termination is a matter of the _ pregnant woman _ , not politicians , not doctor , not anyone else . 
  aaand it 's not funny anymore . 
  i \u00b4 m pretty sure this is fake . 
   damn flying nazis/s ? 
  non-brit here : maybe you can write a little analysis about what you think proves my illiteracy ? 
   nope . 
  noone has ever been convicted https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/apr/04/northern-irish-woman-suspended-sentence-self-induced-abortion https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jan/26/ulster-woman-who-bought-abortion-pills-for-daughter-can-challenge-prosecution i do n't understand how you can say that abortion being _ illegal _ is n't a `` punishment '' . 
  not having safe access to abortion is punishment enough , but then you can go to court because your housemates snoop around your trash and do n't think you were hysteric enough about having an abortion or because you are forced to order abortion pills online to your 15-year-old daughter . 
  i think not considering abortion being illegal not being a punishment is incorrect , even if no one would ever be convinced . 
  happy cake day , 
  long story short : brits were supporting during winter war , then came continuation war , finns were forced to fight along the nazis because no resources , the enemy of my enemy and blah blah and it 's not like we could get any other allies anyway ( even during winter war we were left pretty much alone ) , suddenly brits were formally the enemies of finland because we just attacked their ally , ussr pushed churchill to declare war , churchill sent a secret letter to mannerheim pretty much apologizing that they have to declare a war because allies and shit , then they came and bombed somewhere once doing pretty much not damage at all and that 's it . 
  it was pretty much nothing but a formal war to show support to ussr . 
  i think that u/feynization is actually right about not a single bullet being fired . 
  on an interesting side note , the soviets put heavy pressure on the usa to declare war too to finland but they never did . 
  those stubborn ` muricans , ai n't nobody telling them what to do . 
   i remember them bombing finland and sinking many ships . 
  did n't they bomb somewhere in petsamo like once , did n't cause any damage or casualties and that 's it ? 
  i do n't get where you get the ship part . 
  but then again i can be completely wrong so feel free to correct me , is just that i 've never heard them sinking ships . 
  i remember my historian teacher saying that they bombed a river ( ? ), 
  or something and the only thing lost there were the fishing possibilities . 
   maybe not a direct war , but it was n't just like `` hey , i wan na start a war '' and then nothing happens . 
  actually that was exactly what it was , i think . 
  it was pretty much a formal declaration to please ussr . 
  i mean , it was the british empire . 
  they could have easily ripped us apart . 
  they chose not to . 
   i have heard that there are public clinics in the uk that write-off irish mothers who are pursuing abortions . 
  they are n't meant to do this , but i have heard it does take place for those who are very disadvantaged oh that is lovely , i hope those who need it find that option !, 
   in some cases it can be done in a day trip for sure . 
  i do n't really see how it is possible . 
  i mean like i said , with pills that would be impossible ( unless there would be some illegal smuggling and traveling while being very sick and heavily bleeding ) , but even with surgical abortion , i mean it is not a small procedure that can require anesthetic and you are going to be sick afterwards . 
  and there is of course the risk of bleeding afterwards . 
  i guess it can be done in one day , but i feel really , really bad for the women who have to fly on a plane twice in that day . 
  but i have a feeling that you know what you are talking about . 
  still , that can be a very expensive trip when you consider the loss of income and getting someone to take care of your kids and everything ( since if i remember correctly , most irish women seeking abortion are already mothers . 
  i am not sure if i remember that correctly though ) . 
   i 'm not saying it 's an acceptable alternative , but it could be a lot worse . 
  again , this is not what i want and i am trying to paint an optimistic picture of the current scenario irish mothers face . 
  oh yeah , for sure . 
  could be worse , but still it is definitely one of the worst experiences those women have go through . 
  otherwise it would be just women dying and being injured from unsafe abortion and even committing suicides , like everywhere else . 
  your laws without the uk being there would be catastrophe . 
  oh i and i feel like you are trying to paint an optimistic picture , i hope you did n't get that impression . 
  just discussing about it . 
   you mention insane judgement and stigma . 
  there is judgement and stigma everywhere for abortions to some extent . 
  there is maybe just more in ireland , as the added pressure of travel and expense makes what should be a private matter for a poor young mother , very public and very expensive . 
  yes , abortion is to some extent quite often a very emotional topic . 
  however for example here in finland , with an exception of few religious groups , it is widely accepted and not really an issue . 
  i have n't personally ever met anyone opposing it or seen protest against it , we do n't have any political party pushing to ban it ( the true finns leader , timo soini , who is a catholic who converted in ireland btw :d , opposes abortion but even he would be never crazy enough trying to put it on the party manifesto ) and so on . 
  i do think that religion , especially catholism , plays a big part on how obsessed people are about it . 
  still , of course there are even non-religious people opposing it . 
  it can be really hard if you ca n't tell your parents or friends you have had an abortion . 
   people are given the choice to influence the law , so they feel guilty . 
  in a lot of other countries this kind of ruling does n't go to a public vote . 
  abortion law is written into the constitution from the 1930s ( i think , maybe as late as 1950s ) , and irish law states that the constitution can not be amended without a referendum . 
  it 's just a tough cookie . 
  split public opinion , and a constitution that 's very difficult to change . 
  the only alternative that i can see is the eu intervening , if they even have that power . 
  interesting , thanks for the insight . 
  on a off-topic lighter note , always when i hear about irish people feeling guilty i think of [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2mvow3a7t8 ) . 
  you just starting buddy . 
  exactly . 
  i mean , if you really think about it , fighting the ira ( and maybe a `` few '' civilians on the side , but who is counting ) that just manifested out of thin air for no reason whatsoever than perhaps the irish thirst for blood , is n't really terrorism at all . 
  no but seriously , i find it quite astonishing that one of their biggest campaign trashing tools were corbyn 's `` links to ira '' , but then without missing a beat they went on forming a pact with dup . 
   and a touch of support for terrorism ... well the difference is of course that it was the right kind of terrorism , so that makes it okay . 
   the upside is that it 's cheap and easy to fly into great britain for an abortion . 
  i think you can make the return trip in a single day . 
  it 's not really that cheap . 
  the flights might be cheap , but you just ca n't get an abortion and fly back the same day , especially with medical abortion that would be impossible . 
  there is a need for an accommodation and you have to pay the clinic fee in britain which according to [ this ] ( https://www.mariestopes.org.uk/our-private-services/private-abortion/private-abortion-fees ) is quite much , especially if the abortion is caused by fetal abnormalities . 
  it 's at least 1000 euros . 
  overall the traveling is a physically , mentally and financially taxing and from the women i 've talked to i know it apparently is very traumatizing . 
  just like handling something so difficult alone would n't be hard enough , the insane judgement and stigma makes it even worse . 
   most of the youth , i.e. 
  the ones who actually get pregnant , would probably support more access to abortions , i guess i just find it weird somehow , that in general the public and the government itself is okay with people traveling to get one but if it happens on the irish soil it becomes somehow wrong . 
  i do n't get the mentality . 
  in my personal experience , however this is only anecdotal , i have n't googled any statistics ( if there are any ) is that i was surprised how many young irish people are against abortion . 
  i remember when i was in dublin during a huge pro-life protest , and for a 17-year-old girl the thing that made the biggest impact was how insanely many young dudes where marching for a political cause . 
   the republic of ireland is scheduled for a referendum on the matter next year that is going to be very interesting , i guess we have to wait and see . 
  i always knew portuguese people had a good taste . 
   i think that in the case of the child being disabled , the mothers life being at risk , the child being a result of rape or if the child is going to die anyway , an abortion should be allowed . 
  why abortion when the woman is raped is not murder but when the woman has sex willingly it becomes one ? 
  please explain ? 
   i never stated that people around me do n't have sex . 
  is n't there contraception in finland ? 
  yes it is , we have quality health care and still women have abortions . 
  so what you are saying is that in ireland contraception is 100 % sure and those people who do n't want kids always use it ? 
  so in other words , those 166,951 women just did n't have an access to contraception , and each year there is 3500 more ? 
  of course contraception and sex education is the only way of bringing abortion down , but it will never stop it completely .

  whether the results were right or wrong does not matter , because the result can not be trusted . 
  my personal opinion is that crimea is a very , very , very complicated issue and i 'm not sure how to feel about it . 
  you ( and the rest of the crimeans ) have my sympathies regardless . 
  what i 'm trying to do here in these comments is keep facts straight and the discussion free from claims like that from u/chipsfrischoriental that ( i assume ) on purpose oversimplify the issue . 
  you talk about error margins and then spout statistics that are misleading . 
  [ according to wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/demographics_of_crimea#ethnicities_and_languages ) the biggest ethnicity in crimea is russian with 63 % . 
  where 's that margin of error ? 
  and if kruschev 's drunken gift was such a fumble , why was n't it brought up during the budapest talks ? 
  yeltsin signed a deal that russia will respect the borders - a deal that was not kept . 
  you can argue all you want about motives or legitimacy , but that is a fact . 
  problem is , gallup poll is not a fair referendum . 
  if gallup polls were to be final , hillary clinton would be president of the us and britain would be staying part of the eu . 
  it gives an idea of what the people of crimea think - sure . 
  does it accurately measure it - we ca n't be sure . 
  it certainly is n't enough evidence to invoke international law whereas russia failing to honor the budapest agreement is pretty clear . 
  let 's not pretend that you can distill a century long geopolitical issue into one poll . 
  there 's no simple right and wrong in this case . 
  technically , chechnya was n't part of russia when the ussr broke . 
  that means the parts of the chechnyan conflict that was during those years is russian expansion on a sovereign state . 
  i 'm not making judgements here , just pointing out the facts . 
  it 's possible , but that was n't an opinion . 
  chechnya . 
  that is literally impossible to say one way or the other with current information . 
  in addition , it breaks multiple international treaties . 
  stop putinbotting . 
  that 's not actually how wikipedia defines it . 
  according to it , both the uk and all four parts of it are countries . 
  if you are really certain about this , please go edit it correctly on there . 
  it 's the first source people will go to . 
  need to belonh to a group does not automatically lead to the need to divide into groups . 
  because it makes for good numbers . 
  seriously , that money would have been gone regardless of the eu . 
  like someone else pointed out , the law is vague on purpose . 
  it 's classic european law making . 
  it sets a goalpost `` czech will join the euro '' but does n't enforce the timeline or the will to adopt it . 
  exactly !, 
  thanks , i 'll call it bribing !, 
  also quite fitting since that 's how scotland joined anyway . 
  also for future use , might not want to throw around the word country because it 's not explicitly defined when talking about the uk . 
  uk the country or the four countries in the union ? 
  it 's a bit silly in the modern world , but reactionary conservatism is part of human nature . 
  my issue with the side of the discussion is that sovereignty for arbitrarily defined nation states is taken as a given . 
  scotland and catalonia work as great examples against that too . 
  who gets to declare sovereignty for what ? 
  crying for `` muh sovereignty '' is the european equivalent of `` muh freedomz '' in america . 
  it means that the person who utters it has made up their mind and wo n't discuss it . 
  i 'm a federalist too . 
  but forcing someone into a deal is n't the way to go . 
  also the other side - which seems just as loud - is `` muh sovere ... that thing '' . 
  sides of the same coin . 
  why is everyone in this thread so angry ? 
  they do n't have to take the euro if they do n't want to . 
  uk , denmark and sweden did n't either and it was fine . 
  as long as they can take the ribbing , go ahead . 
  well , that 's a way from keeping the remnants of an empire together - bribing . 
  it was raining . 
  greatest army ? 
  what use is an army on an island without a navy ? 
  or did you mean military ? 
  a protest candidate who has no political experience and misunderstands how the legal systems work ? 
  hmmm , i wish some country would show us how that works out . 
  makes sense for politicians to keep it in limbo but the us is the closest partner to both sweden and finland after the other in terms of defense . 
  all it would take is two names on a paper and we 'd be in nato . 
  also the finnish and swedish defense is so , let 's say compatible , that it makes no sense for either to join without the other . 
  yeah , you have n't left , but long-term planning has to be done - unfortunately - without the uk . 
  you can fight by accepting urbanization . 
  when the power concentrates to emptying rural areas , this is what happens . 
  yeah , but those people did n't accept her changes at face value just because she won an election . 
  just like no one hated thatcher 's changes after she was re-elected ? 
  language thing . 
  to a native english speaker you implied it even if you did n't mean to . 
  same thing happens to me all the time . 
  in a perfect representational democracy ( which we all are ) a decision like this should not have been on the people in the form of a referendum . 
  it 's politicians chickening out of their responsibility to represent the best interest of their country and rolling the blame on the population that can be manipulated easily . 
  wait , marxists ? 
  why would they be for remain ? 
  it 's not like the eu is exactly a shining beacon of labor laws qnd working class protection . 
  i 'm truly confused . 
  exactly my point - albeit i 'll grant that smart-arse . 
  the movement between the uk and the schengen area is limited due to geography so naturally brits would n't end up using the possibility as much . 
  to be fair , we southern finns are in a somewhat similar situation where the only difference is the ease of access to estonia and sweden ( which would exist otherwise too ) , but having lived around europe , it is mighty useful when moving around . 
  might it be because the uk is n't in the schengen ? 
  also geographical borders and such . 
  haha . 
  i remember the eu vote . 
  we would have joined regardless . 
  they would have kept asking until yes won . 
  yes , those damn warmongering swedes .

  how long did rome affect world history after the sacking of rome and the fall of western rome ? 
  quite friggin long .

  it would be a serious regression to go back to those . 
  i did n't insult your country . 
  relax . 
   at last , you reveal where you are from . 
  it 's right there in my flair . 
  also where i 'm from has nothing to do with this discussion .

til there are prisma 's in latvia . 
  i think more people want to get rid of conscription than make it compulsory for women also . 
  two games , two wins !, 
  i guess the win against the swedes was expected but the one against turkey was really surprising , even though we 've been in a pretty good form recently . 
  henrik dettman really knows what he is doing . 
  yes . 
  and the swedes have been doing it openly all along : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fra_law * the fra law ( fra-lagen in swedish ) is a swedish legislative package that authorizes the swedish defence radio authority to warrantlessly wiretap all telephone and internet traffic that crosses sweden 's borders . 
  it was passed by the parliament of sweden on june 18 , 2008 , by a vote of 143 to 138 ( with one delegate abstaining and 67 delegates not present ) [ 1 ] and took effect on january 1 , 2009 . 
  serbia seems to be doing good in all the big team sports ( football , volleyball , basketball ) . 
  lots of good tennis players too . 
  also its seems that serbians living in the nordics are often stereotyped with being involved with organized crime and drug trafficking . 
  it 's funny since all the serbs i 've known have been in food industry or students . 
  friendly people with a great sense of humor . 
   and of course emir kusturica .

  are they right-wing populists ( opportunists ) like true finns and sweden democrats or are they something more serious and similar with the greek golden dawn ? 
  how much support is there for the edl really ? 
  i 'm a little confused since in the finnish press they 're considered either as a minor hooligan group or a major far right threat in british politics .

  and i feel stupid for that . 
  stockholm is pretty and clean and safe but the people are too posh and uptight . 
  i prefer gothenburg personally . 
  helsinki is like a smaller , cleaner and safer version of st.petersburg . 
  lots of smug , wannabe-berliner hipsters in certain downtown districts but if you can avoid them the people are generally friendly . 
  i 've only been a couple of times in copenhagen and it was years ago but back then i thought it was the best nordic capital . 
  best parts of continental europe and scandinavia combined . 
  never been to amsterdam . 
  i 'm all for immigration to finland and i think these protestors are retarded but come on !, 
  you welcomed those finnish migrants with open arms . 
  you had a shortage of workforce in your car factories for example and finnish immigrants in the 50-70 's filled that shortage . 
  it 's not even slightly comparable to today 's refugee crisis . 
  where has it been confirmed that a large number of them are isis ? 
  train/bus trip from malm\u00f6 or stockholm to tornio is probably nice and comfy compared to what they 've endured before on their journey from iraq to northern europe . 
  why not ? 
  good benefits and they 're more likely to get an asylum from finland than in sweden . 
  plus the whole process is faster here . 
  i guess they would take a ferry from sweden straight to helsinki or turku but you need id for that so they 're taking the northern route instead . 
  i kinda like tornio/torne \u00e5 , it has certain charm , but i guess in small , remote towns like that the stereotypes are alive and well . 
  there is n't any proof and the article does n't even claim that . 
  the title of the thread is highly editorialized . 
  sweden , and denmark too , has signed an agreement with the iraqi government which allows some asylum-seekers to be returned forcibly . 
  http://mobile.reuters.com/article/topnews/idusl186017520080219?irpc=932 there are other reasons too , for example the processing time in finland is faster as the amount of asylum seekers is smaller . 
  it 's mostly iraqis who are coming to finland from sweden because for them it 's easier to get an asylum in finland than in sweden . 
  syrians are mostly staying in sweden ( or germany ) as far as i know . 
  200 - 300 people , mostly iraqis , are crossing that border every day . 
  surely housing ca n't be a problem if your town has the money to buy smart phones and designer clothes for refugees ? 
   also , i feel there 's a huge stigma about the refugees . 
  governments want to take them it ( rightfully ) and people are reluctant to do so . 
  some people are reluctant of course but not as many as you 'd think by reading finnish internet comments . 
  why do n't every single refugee storm your little town where everything is free then ? 
  i do n't get why you people keep spreading this bullshit . 
  i used to work with refugees and i can assure you we do n't give away luxuries . 
  stop reading `` alternative media '' . 
   yep , everything is free . 
  stop talking shit . 
  the state nor cities do n't give away smart phones or designer clothes . 
  lots of kids migrate by themselves . 
  there are even dedicated refugee centers for underage migrants who came by themselves . 
  not what i meant , but i 've seen that bottle many time in parties in here ... 
  is that the strong , vodka drink with herbs that tastes a bit like absinthe ? 
  ok , cool . 
  thanks for the best swear word !, 
  god of thunder ? 
  do you still use perkunas/perkele in lithuanian ? 
  that 's the thing though - we did n't come from a one place . 
  some of us came from the east , some from the west . 
  it 's not controversial at all . 
  but that 's a linguistic group !, 
  just like the greek people are mixture of all your neighbours the finns are also mixture of finns , northern germanics , balts , slavs , samis , etc. ... 
  what `` race '' do you think we are part of ? 
  i 'm honestly curious . 
  these pathetic assholes are n't even nationalists . 
  it 's a group lead from sweden which has branches in finland , norway and denmark . 
  their aim is some ridiculous `` pure-breed '' nordic nation . 
  i 've always liked latvia and latvians . 
  not least because they 're one of the few countries in europe who care about hockey . 
  also they 're pretty cool people and riga is a neat city . 
  does this mean that nokia is the owner of bell labs now ? 
  i like the gesture but is n't this just a map of population density of finland as pretty much every lutheran parishes around the country are taking part ? 
  it 's mostly an idiotic alt-right catchphrase from people who have never even been to sweden . 
  do people still mistake you as an ice hockey powerhouse because of the mighty ducks and gunnar stahl ? 
  denmark actually has a pretty decent hockey team nowadays with plenty of players from the nhl and top european leagues .

  that does n't matter at all what comes to erasmus . 
  just fyi for everyone : countries that are in eu but not schengen are uk , ir , cy , bg , ro . 
  countries that are in schengen but not eu are ch , no , is , li . 
  it is n't . 
  for example the finnish evil far-right party thinks that the government spending being 59 % of the gdp is not enough . 
  it 's a study , but many messages making a reference to the study get removed already ** now ** . 
  in the future the employees will think that this is perhaps hate speech and remove it even more often than now . 
  the review will be done by people who have been a week or two on a course for moderators , not philosopher kings who have done their doctor 's thesis about hate speech . 
   race , colour , religion or ethnicity lol , so muslims can say anything about hbtq people and women but risk nothing , while we have to consider whether it is hate speech if we defend them . 
  hate speech should just be abolished completely . 
   promoting hate or discrimination against a group of people everything will be that . 
  if i say that `` according to minnesota transracial adoption study , black adopted children have a far lower iq than white adopted children '' , it gets already now sometimes censored in reddit . 
  in the future it will viewed as possible hate speech and censored . 
  sad to see that the enlightenment both began and ended in europe . 
  hate speech is everything criticizing immigration , and everyone criticizing immigration is far-right . 
  it is extremely important to note that your definition is the definition used by europeans and political scientists ( including schoolbooks ) . 
  in popularized contexts in u.s. communism is the same as socialism in europe and scientifically , and socialism means just things like free healthcare for everyone or for the poor and social benefits . 
  bernie sanders describes himself as a socialist , even though he is not a socialist according to scientists and europeans .

  it wo n't really be more than 6 % of the annual finnish gdp . 
  such an amount of money can be borrowed by the two states . 
   the construction of a tunnel is , more or less , ~ $ 250 m / km the tunnel between helsinki and tallinn is estimated to cost $ 13bn , about $ 170m / km . 
  and that 's probably a quite realistic estimate since a recently built subway line in helsinki cost $ 80m / km and the workforce will be cheaper in this case , i assume . 
  finnish politicians should be replaced with danish ones . 
  finland just considers decade after decade whether railroads to tallinn , stockholm and the arctic ocean should be built but nothing happens ever . 
  if you do n't even have healthcare for the gypsies , i ca n't even think how for example people not fulfilling the whiteness norm or the hetero norm would be treated in the prisons . 
  why is housing in the northern cities so much more expensive than in southern cities ? 
  is it only due to climate or also other factors ? 
  for example in u.s. , most prisoners serve the sentence in their state prison , but there is also federal prisons , as well as a federal police force and a federal court system . 
  the boston marathon bombers were for example tried in a federal court and sentenced to death even though there has n't been a death sentence in massachusetts for over a century . 
  finland could have less autonomy than in grand duchy time between 1809 and 1917 , when political dissidents often fled from the russia proper to finland and as a last resort even the russian policemen were not allowed to come to the grand duchy of finland but it was always the finnish police that had to do the arrest . 
  it would feel quite scary that there likely would not be this kind of protection . 
  people from poor countries that intend to stay temporalily are migrants , and people from rich countries that intend to stay temporarily are expats . 
  exactly . 
  we have already politicians like juncker who thinks that countries with far-right parties in their government should be punished . 
  i could easily the eu banning far-right parties for the sake of convenience . 
  one thing that i would add is the judiciary system . 
  it would be ok for me to be arrested by danish policemen , to be sentenced by a danish judge or to end up in a danish prison . 
  so the nordic countries could be one country from this pov . 
  but if eu would be one country , then you would have to accept that you can end up in romanian prison . 
   gdp per capita is meaningless . 
  in the five member states with highest wages : denmark , sweden , germany , finland and uk the monthly wage ranges between $ 3.2 k and $ 4.1 k. 
  in the five member states with the lowest wages : bulgaria , romania , hungary , lithuania and latvia the monthly wage ranges between $ 487 and $ 900 . 
  this difference is n't something that could be compared between the difference between different u.s. states . 
  the member states have also different healthcare systems so that for example romanian gypsies are not entitled to healthcare or social security systems so that the minimum unemployment benefit is $ 120 in estonia and $ 1,436 in denmark . 
  sweden + finland , the baltic sea and finland all look either like a human , a dick or a human with a dick ... 
  this could be perhaps the reason . 
  it seems a bit weird that switzerland , finland and serbia would be highest on the list and the countries surrounding serbia would be low . 
  what will happen to the old railroad ? 
  i was considering that i should perhaps take a ride on it . 
  will it be used after december by local trains or be completely unused ? 
  i admire her for cutting the salary , but it should be noted that if wages would be cut generally then the private sector would have higher wages and high vacancies in the public sector would be filled with power-thirsty , not so competent people . 
  being drunk , keeping large distance between each other and the people having different hair colors , but no one of them having black hair usually gives away nordic countries + estonia . 
  it gives away finns having alcoholistic tendencies and a wt look in this group of countries . 
  is n't denmark also non-pc ? 
  then almost none of the european far-right parties would be far-right , including fp\u00d6 . 
  it might be that according to some definition the criteria are `` rejection of democracy and support and practice of violence '' , but this is not what juncker means or what the media usually means . 
  i 'm not talking about `` violent , ideologically rigid neo-nazis '' but the far-right . 
  the finns party is a far-right party , as is its norwegian , swiss , latvian and lithuanian counterparts , which are in the government , its norwegian and dutch counterparts which are liberal , or its swiss counterpart which were is based on agrarian politics and its dutch counterpart which is based on the center party . 
  poland and hungary seem to be the only countries where this is a problem . 
  in norway , switzerland , latvia and lithuania i have n't at least heard of rule of law problems . 
  one thing could be that fi , no , ch and lv are more or less protestant , and lt influenced by them . 
  perhaps there is something cultural that makes the far-right parties follow the rule of law in these countries . 
  why would juncker then say so about all far-right parties ? 
  finland has for example a far-right party in its government and i have n't ever heard eu to complain about rule of law . 
  that 's a really good point , but in the scenario that the fight is stopped for some time and humanitarian immigration is abolished completely we do n't have to worry about climate refugees . 
  taking refugees causes so much damage that it 's ok if some other damage happens but the humanitarian immigration is stopped . 
  i 'm ok with , for example , hbtq adoptions and the fight against climate change getting paused for 4 or 8 years if the immigration is abolished as an exchange . 
   human rights human rights are not god-given , but can be changed so that the right to apply for asylum applies only within europe . 
  this was actually the original wording in the asylum treaty . 
  or , if the treaties ca n't be amended , then they should be simply abolished . 
  finland has for example granted freedom of speech in 1776 , abolished peace-time death penalty in 1825 and granted universal right to vote in 1906 all without any human rights treaties . 
  why ? 
  do you believe it wo n't send a signal at all , or that the elite thinks that now people want suddenly to ban abortion and abolish hbtq rights ? 
  not leftist or liberal , but just pro-immigration . 
  if the worst thing happens , that is , taking away the right of hbtq people to adopt , that amendment can be cancelled anytime once the immigration has been halted . 
  but if we take muslims here ( and other people from certain places such as certain countries in sub-saharan africa ) it 's difficult to cancel that decision . 
  unfortunately there is a liberal party that oppose immigration only in some countries . 
  as a far-right voter i do n't do it because i would like them to rule but because it sends a signal to the elite that it should abolish humanitarian immigration . 
  no one wants to stop legal immigration between western countries , not even nazis . 
  it would be so awesome it there was a modern , liberal party that at the same time would want to halt immigration . 
  if we think it with numbers : let 's say that 4.75 million voters are western and 0.25 non-western . 
  of the 4.75 million voters 48 % would vote on van der bellen and of the 0.25 million 90 % would vote on van der bellen . 
  in this scenario van der bellen would get 50.1 % of the votes . 
  that 90 % would vote on van der bellen is based on how non-westerners vote in sweden . 
  yes . 
  in the worst swedish slum , roseng\u00e5rd in malm\u00f6 , about 90 % vote on the left , either the social democratic party or the cultural marxist parties . 
  and unfortunately this seems to be reason , why else would liberal parties import people that are so radically conservative that we westerners ca n't even understand it . 
  if this is the case with some postal ballots , then there will likely be some changes . 
  many people are really bad at writing and it 's sure that a certain share of these ballots has been put aside as too difficult to read . 
  do you write the candidate 's name or number on the ballot ( the result is more likely to change in a 2nd count ) or pick a pre-printed ballot or mark a candidate on a list of candidates ( less likely to change ) ? 
   the political spectrum is the same everywhere . 
  then hofer would not be far-right . 
  if the difference is something like 10,000 or 15,000 and the majority of ethnic austrians and/or westerners would have voted for van der bellen , it would mean that a large share of non-westerners would have voted on hofer . 
   the far sides of the political spectrum is for irrational people . 
  it 's just not logical to say so , because what is a far side varies so much depending on the country and even if it 's far-left/far-right there is a huge variation within them , considering that anyone who wants to halt immigration is automatically far-right regardless of other opinions . 
  or if we consider the differences between different countries , the average nordic right-wing politician would be the most left-wing congressman or senator in u.s. 
  to be exact , multiculturalism won due to multiculturalism .

  i wrote :  did n't you just claim you 're `` a financial/commodity trader '' ? 
  ysk the effect of the falling oil prices always has some inertia . 
  first i 'm talking about your unverified claim that you 're `` a financial/commodity trader '' . 
  then i 'm talking about the oil price and the related inertia which seems to be unknown to you . 
  i can not put it any clearer so here 's to hoping that clarification helps . 
  the dutch safety board has already published their preliminary report months ago . 
  the full final report will take time which is normal as they often take even years to complete . 
   too many conflicting views as to what actually happened . 
  their investigation is not about whodunnit or where the missile originated . 
  that is not what such investigations are for . 
  they are meant to investigate the technical side of things , e.g. 
  investigate in detail what happened to the plane in the breakup and what implications/recommendations that may have . 
  the ongoing criminal investigations go further , they are investigating questions such as who fired the missile , where , when and the origins of the missile . 
  the su planned and invaded finland not only once but * twice * ( albeit on second time the su attacked they arguably had a legitimate casus belli ) . 
  both times they were stopped and instead of occupying the country and the unconditional surrender they demanded the su had to settle for some clay and negotiated peace instead . 
  only afterwards did the su change their story and pretend negotiated peace was what they wanted in the first place , which is directly contradicted by the fact that they had already formed a puppet government for their planned soviet republic of finland , and they only dropped their demands of unconditional surrender after their massive attacks had been brought to halt . 
   what are you blabing ? 
  you boldly claimed : `` there is a trend according to your own charts where it is falling '' i informed you that one month is not a trend . 
  on which official report ? 
  there are several ongoing investigations from the incident investigation by the dutch safety board to criminal investigations . 
  you know what 's stupid ? 
  confusing ad-hom attacks for critique . 
  hey , while you 're at it you forgot these civilian airliner shootdowns : [ kaleva ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kaleva_ ( airplane \\ ) ) shot down by the ussr . 
  [ korean air lines flight 902 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/korean_air_lines_flight_902 ) shot down by the ussr . 
  [ korean air lines flight 007 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/korean_air_lines_flight_007 ) shot down by the ussr . 
  and there 's also these no less than * three * airliners that russian rebels backed and armed by russia shot down in georgia in september 1993 : [ transair georgia airliner shootdowns ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/transair_georgia_airliner_shootdowns ) looks like some have far more experteese on shooting down civilian airliners than others ... 
  right , yet it 's not only the baltic sea but also the northern finland would be strategically very important to occupy . 
  so , basically the whole country from the coast to lapland . 
   there are no those reasons in finland except for the possibility of nato the primary reason remains the same as always : geography . 
  has n't changed for millenia , and has always been the reason why russia/ussr has repeatedly invaded finland through the centuries . 
  if there was a larger conflict in europe , russia would try and invade finland just as it has always done . 
  no declaration of neutrality would help to keep finland out of it , nor would being outside of nato ( in fact that would only make finland even more lucrative target for invasion ) . 
  the only way to convince russia not to try it is to have convincing enough defence - either within nato or without . 
  correct , correct , and ohjelma = ett program, 
   why would we ever invade finland . 
  the only reason i can think of is `` geopolitical necessity and national security '' as you said about invading ukraine . 
  well , as a finn i have never heard finland saying so . 
   during the worst of the fallen o\u00efl prices the economy grew at 0,4 % ... 
  did n't you just claim you 're `` a financial/commodity trader '' ? 
  ysk the effect of the falling oil prices always has some inertia . 
  here 's how the contraction of russia 's gdp looks like : [ graph ] ( http://i.imgur.com/wgsgbvj.png )  the economy has a strong industrial base that as soon the economy crash start to take over the growth . 
  dude , russia 's manufacturing pmi is below 50 . 
  and it just fell even more to 47.6 . 
   i clearly wrote it is falling and will reach pre crisis level there is a trend according to your own charts where it is falling and where it will reach an all time low according to prediction . 
  dude , one month does not a trend make . 
   finland said it was because we were lazy and that we just had to work more . 
  could you point out where exactly finland has said that ? 
   may as well keep the trade up . 
  right , but the problem is the russians have less money to spend . 
  finnish exports are dropping but not because they 're on the eu 's prohibited exports list but first and foremost because the russian economy is contracting . 
  for example , by far the biggest export category has been machinery ( 32 % of exports in 2013 , sitc category : machinery and transport equipment ) . 
  as russia 's economy is tanking there will be less demand for such . 
  which does not tell much anything . 
  for perspective here 's the annual figures 2000-14 : [ chart ] ( http://i.imgur.com/nautixu.png ) edit : as you can see the 2008-9 fall in exports was about -53 % . 
  when russian 's have less money they import less hence the finnish exports fall . 
   i was curious how trade has changed since the start of the crisis in ukraine you might want to take a longer time series for perspective . 
  i believe the 2008-9 drop was probably even larger . 
   russia sanctions hit and our economy is hit again . 
  it 's not so much direct effect of sanctions and countersanctions but the weak ruble and the fact that russia 's economy is contracting . 
  and of course the sanctions do play a role in those but so do the oil prices and the structure of russia 's economy . 
  already about a year ago ( iirc ) the estimates said that if russia 's economy contracts by 3-4 % the effect will be about -0.5 % in finland . 
   many banned russians have absolutely nothing to do with ukraine and crimea . 
  can you point out such persons from the list ? 
  who and how many are they ? 
  blatter will go out , if not tomorrow then in the near future . 
  he has already eaten his chocolates . 
   blatter is pretty old himself . 
  he would have to have pretty shitty lawyers to not drag out his case for a year or two . 
  and sooner or later , he will probably be too old/sick/well-connected to be kept in a proper prison . 
  yes , yes , and so what ? 
  does n't matter if he would be in a proper prison or not . 
  what matters is that blatter goes out . 
  right . 
  that 's the cost of authoritarian leadership . 
  the minimum bet is a generation . 
  doubling down costs more . 
   simultaneous ? 
  yes , in the sense that in the same day ( yesterday ) they both proceeded with raids/arrests/interviews . 
  both investigations have also co-operated . 
   us investigation is a couple years old . 
  basically they are finishing up the investigation now . 
  the us investigators said this is just the beginning . 
   afaict the swiss investigation is new . 
  yes , that has been opened recently . 
  * do not become completely retarded ever !,

  has n't read the fucking indictment or does n't realise rico has been invoked . 
  the indictment is like 160 pages long but i do recommend reading it , even if from here and there because the shit in there is ... do n't even know how to put it . 
  try reading it , and you 'll see what i mean : http://images.businessweek.com/bloomberg/pdfs/fifaindictment.pdf  warner stated , `` there are some people here who think they are more pious than thou . 
  if you 're pious , open a church , friends . 
  our business is our business . '' right on brother . 
  your and your pals ' business was to destroy a fine sport for your personal profit . 
  ( oh and btw , ~ ~ nike ~ ~ no i mean `` sportswear company a '' stock owners might want to consider their options of balancing their briefcase as there may be trouble at the horizon with the law and stuff like that . 
  rico is the bad cop with the porn moustache from the '70s movies . 
  with rico not only those who planned and committed the crimes but also those who benefited are brought to justice . 
  so , now as rico has been invoked : dear blatter , good luck with that . 
  no money is going to buy your way out of it . 
  no , not even your fucking billions . 
  rico already has your corrupt geriatric over-80 subordinates who will love to make a deal over dying in prison old age , and they 'll tell all about it . 
  they will .

  huh , i ca n't possibly answer ... too many . 
   what 's the best food on the continent ? 
  italy , france , ~ ~ spain ~ ~ , greece and of course portugal !, 
   where can you find the prettiest women in europe ? 
  at my house ofc . 
  hehe but seriously , it depends on what is your type . 
  if you fancy more the paler/blonder type , northern europe or central europe is more for you , southern europe is if you appreciate that more tanned darker beauty , eastern europeans have the reputation of being feminine and stunning . 
  whenever you go , if there is young people there tends to be beautiful people . 
   in name of equality , the hottest guys are in ireland , norway , france and ~ ~ spain ~ ~ portugal imo . 
  \u2764 \u2764 vive la france , vive la r\u00e9publique, 
  i do n't see the point of this post . 
  at all . 
  oh god , he looks like he is suggesting a threesome and everyone else are uncomfortable as fuck and try to play it a as a joke but he just does n't drop it . 
  or that super creepy drunk uncle who goes on and on how beautiful young women you 've become with your sisters . 
  seriously that was so painful to watch . 
  leave the dutchies alone . 
  if these thingies make sweet sweet love to dutch tastebuds , who are we to judge ? 
  btw my friend who studies in holland finds bitterballen to be very tasty , so maybe looks can be deceiving . 
  oh look , we _ almost _ managed to have a light hearted thread about sweden without involving immigration and/or muslims , and what a tragedy would that have been . 
  so great that you swooped in to prevent that from happening , thank you so much for your contribution in this discussion viharikos ( btw his name means hatercrime , shocking ) !, 
  of course he looks happy , belgian fries are heavenly . 
   and everything was great .

  to tell a girl to man up ? 
  that is gender equality for you ? 
  nice to hear since then my dad is the most equal man in this planet , i heart that like once a week at least :d about pushing me into the wilderness all alone , that i agree on . 
  finnish dads ( dudes ) do n't really care that much about princess treatment or whatever you want to call it . 
  ah , the old classic summer cottage toilet you were always so afraid of falling into . 
  or going when it was already dark , and then you tried to ask your dad to walk with you and he would tell you to stop whining and man up which is pretty strange when you are a 10-year old girl . 
  then you had to take one of your sister which was horrible since they would always scare you . 
  that awkward moment you have so many arguments listed that you ca n't give one . 
  :d  yes , you are clearly the moron . 
   personally i 'd say it 's pretty obvious you have no idea what you 're talking about hmm yup i think we are done here , good day to you sir . 
   teachers can tell students not to speak finnish in recess . 
  the school administration can tell finnish speaking teachers not to speak finnish to their students in the dining hall . 
  teachers speaking finnish in the teachers lounge are asked to change to swedish . 
  not just children , but adults too . 
  and not speak swedish in sense of learning swedish , talking swedish to swedes and using it at school ( and everywhere else ) that would be about integration like so many in this thread try to make it about . 
  this is about not wanting finns talking to other finns in finnish . 
  but please dude , wild horses could n't stop the french from speaking french to each other if they have an opportunity to it , abroad or not . 
  i do n't have to know you to guess that if you left france and had the opportunity to speak french with a french co-worker just between the two of you during the lunch break you would do that , or that you would teach french to your kids . 
   a swedish speaking finn in helsinki usually has more in common with a finnish speaking finn in helsinki than they have in common with a swedish speaking finn from ostrobothnia , much less swedes from sweden there we go , _ exactly _ this . 
  thanks for putting in words i could n't , since this is the most accurate answer in this thread . 
  as a finnish-speaking finn ( in helsinki  ) whose neighbor , one of best friends , huge amount of friends and most importantly ex-boyfriend of two years is a swedish-speaking finn reading something like freddan95 here is suggesting is quite confusing . 
   you pussies just stop it , aina saa h\u00e4vet\u00e4 . 
   oppressed minority , you say ? 
  perhaps we should intervene !, 
  finally we get to put that expensive and time-consuming monster to use !, 
  for non finns , the reason we have mandatory army service for men is that we \u00b4 re preparing to invade sweden . 
  that reminds me , the funniest russian troll i 've ever met online was this sweet dude trying to convince me how we finland is n't really threatened by russia , but sweden ( hey btw , is anyone else worried about the amount of disinformation spread about sweden ? 
  what 's up with it ? ), 
  and especially norway . 
   moron , where exactly did i say that they are n't finnish ? 
  you claimed that they are as culturally finnish as finnish speakers , which is n't the case . 
   they are just as finnish as everyone else , yup , i am _ definitely _ the moron in this conversation . 
  i meant exactly what i wrote there . 
   also helps that you are culturally more similar and more familiar with the country you are moving to . 
  oh is that so . 
  : , d please teach me more about the identity of swedish speaking finns , because this is completely new information to me . 
  let me guess , because swedish-speaking finns are n't alcoholic drunks stabbing everyone around them , right ? 
  i have seen some studies how little swedes know about finland , but it never really hit me until i started meeting swedes ( or even reading the opinions of swedes in reddit . . ) , but it is quite shocking . 
  btw , what he is expressing here is a prime example of the attitude some people have against finns and what kind of stereotypes are still well and alive in sweden . 
   like that 's the only thing where they are similar to us . 
  well , please , enlighten me sir . 
   they would have been ours if the league of nations had respected the opinion of the inhabitants . 
  personally i think that if they felt like joining you guys they would be completely free to do so . 
  and btw , those few people i actually know from ahvenanmaa do n't feel swedish , they identify as \u00c5landers , however that is anecdotal evidence . 
  but i guess you know this better too . 
   that 's just not true . 
  oh no , is that so ? 
  damn , i have to inform everyone this dude from reddit knows their identity better than they do , it must be quite shocking to hear so long in your life how you actually are n't finnish . 
   they have always been significantly overrepresented when it comes to emigrants from finland well no shit :d of course when you speak the language it is easier to emigrate . 
   and they are culturally much closer to sweden than finnish speakers . 
  oh yes , that crayfish party once a year really sets them apart , the cultural differences are just massive , i hardly can manage being friends with them . 
  i see this _ all _ the time . 
  not about swedish speaking finns but between sweden and finland . 
  i still do n't know what those differences are . 
   also this 5 % figure includes people from \u00c5land , who are only finnish in the sense that they are finnish citizens . 
  come get them then , hihi . 
  no , but seriously , it actually is n't and i would love to hear what is your source for that . 
  that 4,9 % is about continent finland . 
  edit : altough it is important to point out since we are discussing this that some swedish-speaking finns feel discriminated and not welcomed to speak their language in public places too . 
   arabic is waaay bigger than finnish , syrians just became our largest minority group , and then there are hundreds of thousands of iraqis , palestinians etc. 
  haha i thought about adding that maybe arabic is the biggest language now since i was unsure of that , but was too lazy to google it . 
  thanks for the correction . 
    i 'm not sure what you are talking about regarding laws against finnish in the workplace , that sounds crazy . 
  https://yle.fi/uutiset/3-5813258 sorry i do n't have any other source for that , it 's in finnish . 
   and the teachers restricting finnish during recess can go fuck themselves < 3, 
   is the discrimination towards specifically finnish , or any language that is n't swedish ? 
  specifically finnish . 
  no other language is treated this way to the point of making laws prohibiting people speaking that language at their workplace . 
  ~ ~ however it is fair to note that no other language has as many speakers than finnish in sweden ~ ~ . 
  or i could be wrong , maybe teachers are telling somali and polish kids not to speak their own language during the breaks too . 
   the ~ ~ finish ~ ~ finnish minority was mostly immigrants and refugees with refugees you mean the kids sent there during the war ? 
   the swedish minority was native to finland . 
  they are not a swedish minority , they are a swedish-speaking minority .

  well he is n't actually speaking swedish just saying random words in between the finnish narration , like `` damen and kvinnor '' , `` b\u00e4sta tittare '' , etc. 
  he is also deliberately using some of them incorrectly . 
  he 's actually saying some swedish words and phrases .

  interesting . 
  you could say '' \u00c4l\u00e4 kata '' in finnish but the word `` kata '' has a bit different meaning nowadays and usually it would be translated as `` do not set ( the dinner table ) '' . 
  kattaa , from which the kata comes , does mean to cover something . 
  so what is `` do not cover '' ? 
  i 'll take it that companies usually use bokm\u00e5l and not nynorsk ? 
  yeah , bloody dane !, 
  thank you for the answer . 
  we too , like germany , have a church tax and that probably is one reason why leaving a church is regulated by a law . 
  sorry about the stupid question but is that legal ? 
  i mean here the freedom of religion act states that everybody has the freedom to join or leave a religious community or a church . 
  and if for some reason the said community would refuse to accept your resignation ( which would be illegal ) you can still simply file the paperwork at the local register office and from that day forward you are no longer a member of that community .

  unilever international sells the british marmite as our mate in australia and new zealand , while sanitarium sells the new zealand marmite as `` nz-mite '' in the uk . 
   vegemite ( / \u02c8v\u025bd\u0292\u1d7bma\u026at / vej-\u0259-myt ) [ 2 ] [ 3 ] is a thick , black australian food spread made from leftover brewers ' yeast extract with various vegetable and spice additives . 
  it was developed by cyril percy callister in melbourne , victoria in 1922 . 
  the vegemite brand is currently owned by mondelez international , [ 4 ] but will be acquired by the australian bega cheese group following an agreement in january 2017 . 
  [ 5 ]  in 1919 , following the disruption of british marmite imports after world war i and prior to the introduction of vegemite , callister 's employer , the australian company fred walker & co. , gave him the task of developing a spread from the used yeast being dumped by breweries . 
  callister had been hired by the chairman fred walker . 
  [ 6 ] vegemite was registered as a trademark in australia that same year . 
  callister used autolysis to break down the yeast cells from waste obtained from the carlton & united brewery . 
  concentrating the clear liquid extract and blending with salt , celery and onion extracts [ 7 ] formed a sticky black paste . 
  so they are as near a same product as they can be with slight differences . 
  marmite ? 
  it 's a salty spread made from a left over bakery yeast , tea , irnbru cans or at least i bring those home with me when i visit england for work . 
  yesterday we had a russian general boasting about walking through finnish lapland to sweden in just two days . 
  i have a vague feeling like someone famous might have made the same statement in -39 and it did n't exactly go as planned . 
  likely because only place to get octopus here in the north is from a can and those are ... well quite rubbery in both taste and structure . 
  no the real answer is because cheese is expensive as hell in the nordics so if you slice it thin you can eat it longer . 
  it 's a technical job but unlike in it you ca n't bunker your self in an office and just code away since you have to be on the field with the machines in question and that means you have to be able to understand at least some german especially if your job also entails on teaching the workers in how to use it . 
  i was flat out told by a german interviewer in email that not speaking any german ( even if the employer in question offers language courses as part of the training package ) is a huge nope . 
  well germany has an abundance of technical jobs atm . 
  in eures so learning german would benefit a technical career quite considerably .

  well , once those poles have been inserted the wall often is supported solely by them and sometimes when the end wall is very high such as in log church , vertical poles are inserted to stabilize the gable but its not a ` true ' stave building because those staves do n't help support the roof . 
  they function more like the flying arches of stone cathedrals . 
  that 's not a stave building , it has been supported later with staves when the log wall has started to crumble from rot . 
  stave houses are unique to scandinavia as far as i know . 
  the thing with houses in skyrim is that they have nordic-style stave framing and decorations but middle-english fireplace and chimney system and central european lathe & clay mortar walls . 
  so yeah , kind a pseudo-nordic when you start analyzing it .

  yeah , tough people in that generation ... my grand uncle destroyed 4 tanks with satchel charges in one battle at spring of -44 and i 've heard that a record which someone else did was 12 . 
  4 or 12 tanks might not sound that much until you realize what a satchel charge is ... 
  it 's a 6kg block of tnt which you lit and throw under the advancing enemy tank . 
  well for starters you might want to try [ eures ] ( https://ec.europa.eu/eures/public/en/homepage ) and follow the links to about 20 different never-heard-of-what-the-heck-is-this . project pages of different eu organizations related to job seeking that never ever disclose or heaven forbid advertise that they even exist because somebody might actually use them . 
  my pet peeve about various eu projects is that they never ` advertise ' their existence to common people . 
  ` kuumaa ' which alternatively means either ` hot stuff ' or ` moon-earth ', 
  while he took part in winter war as well , this one happened in the continuation war . 
  yep , it gets kind of boring when we have plenty of other `` crazy '' guys to pick from . 
  people like viljam pylk\u00e4s for example who killed around 80 soviet soldiers with a submachine gun in one attack just by his own - if we do n't include his friend who kept filling mags so he could keep on shooting . 
  pylk\u00e4s could have killed even more but his sub-machine gun 's muzzle overheated and he was forced to change the barrel which allowed the remaining soviet battalion to escape . 
  h\u00e4yh\u00e4 circle jerk is the one meme i wish i would n't have to witness every single time winter war or snipers are mentioned . 
  indeed , much better for the surrounding neighbor realms to exact tribute in to their rulers personal coffers than losing thousands of soldiers for practically nothing . 
  hotels and hostels in finland go for about 50-150 $ per day and food something around 80 $ per candle light diner , groceries go for around 60-80 $ / a week depending what and how many you need to feed . 
  macedonia the one that looks like a rippoff from imperial japan 's flag ?

  my two favourite mugs are a bit random : nr 1 . is a ( now slightly chipped ) mug i bought for ~ 2 euros as part of a birthday package as a for my husband ( then boyfriend ) . 
  he does n't like it , i use it all the time . 
  it is big and widens slightly in a nice straight line . 
  cheap early nineties non-figurative almost pastel-y decor , think fabric scraps for interiors for car ferries or really nice institutions . 
  nr 2 . is beige and very plain , slightly rounded form . 
  bought in kaunas while on a car trip long ago , ca n't remember why anymore . 
  both are very pleasant to hold , and just the right thickness . 
  not fine porcelain - thin , but not clunky thick . 
  brands vary . 
  often there is some nescaf\u00e9 espresso in the mix . 
  jacobs millicano / momente ( w/o any stupid flavouring ) is a favourite , but is n't sold in my country . 
  the perfect cup is a random occurrence that happens when the right mix of different instants hits the right time of day and the right instant-to-water ratio . 
  sometimes the perfect cup is made in a presso brewer or with ground coffee in a mug ( like in eastern europe ) . 
  whatever dark roast happens to be available that has n't died of old age . 
  eta : the nespresso machine can also make nice things . 
  what would you do with cold water ? 
  water from the electric kettle , a little before or after it has turned itself off . 
  the instant coffee must then be allowed to stand a minute or so before even thinking of drinking it . 
  strongish . 
  but my taste seem to vary . 
  as i said , the perfect cup is a serendipitous event that ca n't be predicted . 
  always sugar , 2-4 lumps depending on size of lumps . 
  preferably added before the hot water . 
  skim milk about 1/4 to 1/3 of the total cup volume . 
  biscuits ? 
  hmm . 
  not necessary . 
  ditto for a piece of cheese or anything else . 
  a nice sandwich with ryebread , cheese and salad can be a perfect companion . 
  very salty snacks like salt sticks or potato crisps should be avoided in combination with coffee - it tricks my body into believing i have eaten some real food . 
  feeling weak and becoming irritable and angry follows 4-6 hours later . 
  boiled eggs ? 
  quick and easy to do in your sleep . 
  especially hard boiled eggs are really easy : put eggs in cold water on the stove , jump into the shower , 10-15 minutes later your eggs are nice and ready to be shelled and sliced ... 
  you are a really good writer , i think i 've laughed at all your posts in this thread . 
  just wanted to tell you . 
   a slightly burnt milk taste . 
  as i was writing i thought about whether to describe the taste of low-lactose as `` milk that has been thoroughly boiled '' , but then went with `` sweet '' , as that is how i most often see it described . 
  for myself i do n't think of the taste as `` sweet '' , i always think of it as `` boiled '' . 
  since the taste does n't bother me ( never drink milk as such , only in coffee and in food ) , and low lactose and long shelf life are important to me , i really like that these are available . 
   you guys in europe are like food mad scientists when it comes to milk . 
  i have had uht milk and it is disgusting . 
  yup :-) and finland seem to be especially mad scientist-y wrt milk . 
  uht milk is usually not disgusting per se , but if it was low lactose milk ( which it often is ) i can understand you ; there 's a definite difference in taste . 
  slightly sweeter - which is part of the reason i like it in coffee . 
  another reason for finding it disgusting is temperature , since it does n't have to be refrigerated ( before opening ) the first glasses would be lukewarm and milk at room temperature tastes very different from cold milk . 
   i am curious why jam died out though , did the soviets take the knowledge to make it with them ? 
  ( i am joking but am still curious ) not estonian , and no soviet past for finland , but i 've noticed the same thing : jam and jellies becoming less common . 
  i think it is just a slow generational thing . 
  might have to do with fresh imported fruits becoming more available ( and cheaper ) year round , and hence jams and preserves losing their importance as `` winter fruits '' . 
  my grandmothers grew up with few imported fruits available in winter ( ~ 1920ies ) , for my parents ' generation ( born 1940ies ) imported things were still scarce after the war . 
  in that world jams and preserves are a big part of fruit during the winter . 
  another thing that contributes is a general move away from desserts ( it seems to be slowly changing again ) as something un-healthy and outmoded . 
  the generations born 1910-1930-iesh still saw a simple dessert ( cookies , berry-soup , custard , a fruit or some tinned pineapple etc ) as a normal part of an everyday dinner , people born after that do n't . 
  my husband had `` everyday desserts '' as a child in the early 60ies , i did n't in the mid-70ies . 
  in the 80-ies desserts really became something `` bad '' , lots of dessert-products ( custard powder , jelly-mix , things like that ) just disappeared from stores . 
  now they are coming back , but more often as ready-made than as powder mixes . 
   [ strawberries ] personally i found no difference . 
  in this case the difference was staggering . 
  the cheaper variety was frozen and packaged in belgium ( iirc ) from morrocan grown strawberries . 
  the more expensive variety ( more than double the price / kg ) was finnish grown , frozen & packaged . 
  the latter was much sweeter , had a much stronger flavour and the berries were smaller and more colourful . 
  i hate it when the cheaper product turns out to be very inferior !, 
   i find it odd but interesting you put jam on hearty foods . 
  see above in the thread - not jam in general , but specifically lingonberry . 
   what percent milk fat do you have access too ( here it is skim , 1 % , 2 % and homo milk ) loads of varieties , and almost all are also available as low lactose or non-lactose , also as uht long shelf-life . 
  me personally i use almost exclusively low-lactose skim in coffee and whole ( about 3.5 % , sometimes low lactose , sometimes full lactose ) for porridges and cooking generally . 
  other common varieties are 1 % and 1,5 % fat . 
  i think 1,5 % is the most common . 
  the newest milk variety is a 2,5 % `` cooking milk '' where they have removed some proteins that are particularly prone to burning . 
  it actually works pretty well , you do n't have to be paranoid about constant stirring when cooking milk-based porridges . 
  ( technically the non-lactose varieties and the `` cooking milk '' are `` milk drinks '' , but nobody pays attention to that - it 's just that when you modify milk in certain ways it ca n't be legally sold as `` milk '' . ), 
  not in finland , and i 've never encountered quark with curd/bits in germany either . 
  the only place i 've had quark with curd/bits was in eastern poland at a b&b - it was delicious !, 
  but i could n't find that particular type ( curds , very creamy , very low acidity/tartness ) it in grocery stores in poland either , so maybe it was a very local thing . 
  you are asking too much in one question !, 
  but let 's see - i 'll start off by saying that i happen to live so that i could go grocery shopping every day , but usually it happens 2-3 times a week . 
  ditto for my husband ( we are both middle-aged and childless ) - we usually go to different stores , he likes big and fancy and i like convenient in the building next door . 
  today i bought low-lactose skim milk ( for my coffee , sometimes i think i 'm a calf i drink so much of this ) , mineral water , vanilla flavoured quark , frozen strawberries ( two different varieties to test whether the more expensive one is really better ) , ready made fish-balls ( like meatballs but fish ) and a few tins of fruit . 
  not really a typical shopping list for me , typical would be something like milk , eggs , black bread , ham , cheese , mineral water , chocolate . 
  my nearest store is not that great for fruit and veg , so husband usually gets those . 
  but let 's see your list : * peanut butter - nope , never bought that . 
  i think you can find it more easily these days . 
  * jam/jelly/preserves - oh yes . 
  quite a large selection . 
  lingonberry to eat with meatballs , cabbage rolls , liver etc is very important !, 
  also of course strawberry or raspberry with ice cream or pancakes and such . 
  * ready to eat meals - yes , these are quite common . 
  some are good , some not . 
  i do n't buy these very often . 
  what is also quite common is `` almost ready to eat '' , like my fishballs today . 
  not a complete meal , but a ready made component of a meal . 
  again , some are good , some horrible . 
  * common breakfast items - do n't really know . 
  tea/coffee and some bread and cheese ? 
  yoghurt maybe . 
  i grew up in a jam & toast household myself , but sweet things in the morning seems a bit frowned on here . 
  * cereals - very common , judging by the variety m\u00fcsli seems rather popular . 
  hot cereals/porridge is quite common too , even in nifty one-serving instant packets . 
  * common beverages - milk , mineral waters , soda - usual coke/pepsi/sprite / 7up/fanta and also local brands .

  given this and getting the politicians ' and economists ' numbers on what is needed to avoid a chaos , i 'm inclined to choose the option with some remaining certainty . 
  anyways , i really respect your opinion and i wish thoughts like that would be voiced more often . 
  if more people thought like you , maybe politicians would have the spine to tell their constituents the truth . 
  all you 've said about what the ez leaders are likely to do is true . 
  just like the us stimulus package was n't large enough to be wholly effective , the european leaders are also likely to come up with just half-measures . 
  but i 'm still hoping that while the end draws closer , they 'll be forced to an agreement that will actually be enough . 
  it probably wo n't be presented as openly and clearly as it should be , and i doubt it 'll be democratic either . 
  though to be completely honest , i 'm not sure if direct democracy would even work in this situation anymore . 
  perhaps a majority of people are so tired with the way things 've been handled , they 'd vote down anything ( this as opposed to voting it down because they believe it to be a worse solution than the alternative ) . 
  we 'll just have to judge it by its merits when it comes . 
  if it 'll save the ez , it 'll most likely do so by stronger integration . 
  luckily , there 's an outcry for more democratic rule in the eu , so if there 's going to be any change to the treaties , changes to make the union more democratic will very likely be included . 
  if we 're going to weather the storm institutional changes like this are desperately needed to give the system more legitimacy . 
  i do n't see why we could n't preserve different cultures in the eu , even though we were more strongly integrated . 
  i think we share a lot stronger values overall than the north and south for example share in america . 
  if we thought of each other as european as well as from our individual nations and recognized our common goals , i do n't see why not . 
  everyone already shares the basic idea of being european , we just need to start looking at it as something we can be proud of . 
  i do n't think you even could make italians less italian or swedes less swedish . 
  but there 's no need to , being european also means recognizing each others differences . 
  that 's why it 's in varietate concordia . 
  if you go to northern norway , you might want to take the road through finland , you 'll get to see some great forest & lake sceneries travelling up towards the boarder . 
  it 's a long way to drive though , haha . 
  still , highly recommended . 
  i do n't think it 's especially admirable of me . 
  i think it 's just the cost of preserving any economic stability in europe . 
  if large countries like italy default on their debts , it will cause a whole scale depression in all europe , finland including . 
  we will have rollbacks of the welfare state and extensive austerity measures to deal with the loss in gdp , on a scale only seen in the beginning of the 90s . 
  none of us wants to go through that again . 
  this is where we 're headed if we do nothing to help southern europe . 
  now if there 's anything we can do to alleviate this problem , with a lesser cost to our citizens than a depression , we owe it to ourselves to try . 
  and italy owes it to everyone else to try as well . 
  the only way to avoid a depression at this point is working together . 
  it may prove at some point that we ca n't do anything to avoid it , but at least for now that point has n't yet been reached . 
  i do agree with you on the transparency and need to be honest about all the deals made in the eu . 
  far too often people are left uncertain of what is actually happening and this generates both distrust and anger . 
  politicians are trapped in not being able to really describe the gravity of the situation for fear of alarming the markets and then not being able to wholly explain to their constituents why the measures taken are needed to remedy the situation . 
  nevertheless , trying to hide the real costs for fear of a populist backlash is n't helping anyone . 
  honesty and ` we 're doing everything we can ' is much more likely to produce positive results . 
  regarding ` i am not saying that they ca n't btw , i am just saying that decades of mismanagement will not be washed away in a few months , particularely when they have n't even elected their pm . 
  ` , i do n't think it can be either . 
  i just think this is the only shot we 're going to get . 
  and as italy recognizes this , it is more likely than ever before to be a turning point in their internal politics as well . 
  i think it 's a feature of the parliamentary system that when gone wrong , it only finds ways to revise itself when it 's on the edge of the chasm . 
  perhaps they could 've made reforms earlier , they certainly should have , but right now what matters is what they do next . 
  pragmatism . 
  they would most definitely have wiped out or deported all the slav population as well , they just did n't get far enough to start that process . 
  it was actually a big constraint on hitler 's eastern campaign , because the germans refused to back up the anti-soviet movements amongst the people and failed to capitalize on their desire to rid themselves of totalitarianism . 
  ( i guess this is hard to do when you 're a totalitarian fascist yourself . ), 
  instead they played on racial prejudices to get some of the people do their work for them and instutued many hated oppressive regimes across eastern europe . 
  the gay person did n't choose his homosexuality any more than you chose your apparent heterosexuality . 
  and homosexuals have the exact same right to celebrate their identity in a parade as any other minority . 
  the only deviation there is , exists in the minds of man . 
  in sweden finns are violent and drunk . 
  in finland swedes are gay . 
  that 's the first time i 've been called a nice motherfucker . 
  though in the interest of honesty , i do believe denmark should be included in the nice motherfuckers too . 
  the silent majority that 's benefited from all the eu projects , rights and opportunities needs to step up and take the floor from the vocal sceptics . 
  and the younger generations that live in a much more interconnected world , that do n't share the old animosities that my parents ' used to have towards other european states , need to start co-operating so we can build a better europe ; a couple of hundred years ago we were the envy of all the world . 
  how ` bout we become an example for all the world instead ? 
  i think the eu is the best thing that 's happened to my country , but it 's up to all us to make it work like it was envisioned . 
  there are still people out there who have n't yet lost faith in a united europe . 
  `` spain , italy , greece etc. 
  have caused their own downfall by lying , cheating and gambling . 
  now they want to drag the north down with them . '', 
  this is unfortunately a quite common point of view in the north . 
  i agree with your point about trust needing to be earned by showing the people 's willingness to vote for anti-corruption candidates , but it 's very hard for the italians to vote for someone who 's not corrupted , because of the whole political process that requires you to do all sorts of shady dealing to even be endorsed and considered a serious candidate . 
  it 'd challenging to surface as a new face in the parliamentary process when prime ministers must become the leaders of their parties first . 
  and i 'd just like to add that if us finns suddenly switched places with the italians and we 'd be stuck in their political system , i doubt we 'd be able to do any better . 
  the problems are structural , and this was probably part of your point , but the debt crisis unfortunately does n't have time to wait for the benefits of structural reforms to emerge . 
  what monti 's asking is that we give italy a chance , even if there is n't much to back it up ; that we trust in them to do it right this time , because if we do n't , then nothing they attempt will make a difference . 
  their ability to succeed depends as much on us as it does on them , because of the way the free markets work . 
  i 'd rather give the italians this opportunity to fix things for all our sakes , than to let their economy fall to everyone 's detriment . 
  i 've always thought this debt crisis is an opportunity to fix the long standing economic problems of the european nations and ensure no similar disaster will threaten us in the future . 
  damn you sweden , you beat us again !, 
  yea , it was a poem before they made it into the song . 
  i think the first stanza actually sounds better in swedish . 
  the problem is ` of our fathers ' is ` isien ' in finnish , but grandparents is made up of grand + parents , so ` isovanhempien ' . 
  and there 's virtually nothing that has few enough syllables to fit the tune . 
  too bad , nice idea though . 
  yea , the germans seem to make sort of pompous drinking songs . 
  i actually had to check whether there was big differences in the lyrics , seems like basically the same stuff we just talk about nature more , though at least ours has no reference to god . 
  i 'd like to change the ` of our fathers ' part though , ca n't help thinking it 's a bit sexist every time i hear it , but there 's no real other alternative that would fit the tune , at last that i can think of . 
  nice tune anyways . 
  nice try finland . 
  also , i agree with op . 
  it 's great that the marseillaise 's survived from way back then . 
  can you get that stuff in a restaurant or something ? 
  next time i go to norway i 'm definitely trying it out . 
  those livers under the peas look huge . 
  what animal 're they from ? 
  i was reading this article and looked at the / r/europe image and it reminded me of jfk 's inaugural address in 1961 : ` in the long history of the world only a few generations have been granted the role of defending freedom in it 's hour of maximum danger . 
  i do not shrink from this responsibility ; i welcome it . 
  i do not believe that any of us would exchange places with any other people or any other generation . 
  the energy , the faith , the devotion which we bring to this endeavor will light our country and all who serve it ; and the glow from that fire can truly light the world . ', 
  would that not be something for us to endeavour to ? 
  so long have we read about old dead thinkers and europe 's glorious past . 
  would we not all come together to lead europe into a new era , bringing the light of reason to all the world . 
  not by the sword or the musket but by our example ; in science , education , the environment and human rights . 
  we too seldom ask ourselves ` what does europe mean to you ? ' . 
  this is what europe means to me .

  continuation : i am a bit irritated by the low support for eu-wide military cooperation over here , though . 
  the whole thing is a very easy equation . 
  our military exists to defend us against the threats from stronger neighbors with possible interests of invading -- the only such potential enemy at this time is russia , so our military strategy is built around making a russian invasion difficult . 
  our military , however , is not strong enough to deter a russian invasion altogether if the russians do decide to invade . 
  neither is our economy , or the population size , strong enough to build an army that could go toe-to-toe with the russian army . 
  and as long as we are a small nation in the pull of the much stronger german economy , which due to our rather unfortunate geographic location we always will be , our economy never will be that strong either . 
  the only option that leaves us is to cooperate with other nations around us that share similar interests militaristically , economically , and politically . 
  this would obviously be the eu . 
  on top of that , if we think ahead , it 's completely untenable to think that our economy would ever develop to a point where we 'd be better off on our own . 
  we 're too small , have too few natural resources , and do n't have the legislation or the taxation to compete for foreign investment either , and the german budget surplus kills the rest of our hopes for competing at the global markets . 
  literally the only sensible political direction for finland to take is to push for tighter eu cooperation with a strong financial policy and internal money transfers , a stronger eu military cooperation with permanent eu troops in finland and estonia/latvia , and better eu-coordinated trade relations with russia . 
  the fact that no one seems to really realise that is worrisome . 
  any possibility you or someone else could summarise it and post it somewhere ? 
  i 've been waiting to read about his actual program for a while , but it has n't popped up anywhere that i would have seen .

  the imgur title translated :  fok_it : big news !, 
  we were commissioned a portrait of the president of finland . 
  although it might be that the commission was received in a dream . 
  and it might also be that we used the wrong picture as a model . 
  but well anyway . 
  fok_it is a finnish comic strip that has been published in a couple of newspapers and magazines over here . 
  very over-the-top satirical and cynical in style , and with the exact same art style that is presented in the portrait here . 
  good stuff . 
  please , the uk is still in the eu and the eea . 
  a bit too early to call them the new switzerland . 
  having been to italy a few times , though , i am of the opinion that there are reasons for those views . 
  because we have tons of russian loan words in our normal lexicon . 
  we 're just as remote from swedish as we are from russian ( one could actually most likely make the claim that we 're lexically closer to russian due to centuries of living relatively close to one another before recorded history ) , yet this map links us to them and not to russian . 
  for accuracy , we should be connected to both , though still very remotely . 
  it probably includes housing , utilities , food , and salaries of the officials who work with the refugees , whether at refugee centres or in state bureaus with all the official paperwork . 
  that figure seems highly likely .

  this seems like a very typical researcher response from someone who studies the risks and costs of substance use ( and abuse ) , be it of cigarettes , alcohol , or narcotics . 
  not that i 'd think it 's bad to focus on cost analysis , i think having that data is very important in terms of making policy and value decisions , but we should also recognise that it 's not the be-all end-all argument . 
  yes , it costs the society . 
  yes , the treatment of the damages caused by it , both to the users themselves and the people around them , is a financial burden on the state and the individuals involved . 
  but is that not the price of freedom and citizen happiness ? 
  is n't limiting that freedom of making your own choices , whether good or bad , and searching for your own lifestyle exactly the restricting thing that gets badmouthed as the `` nanny state '' ? 
  i , for one , would always argue that incurring those costs for the sake of individual freedom and the positives of that freedom is worth the costs . 
  i am an asthmatic , and smokers put me at an increased personal risk . 
  but i am still very willing and ready to pay my taxes for the provision of those services to the people who make those choices , even if they threaten me , and i think many others are too .

  why would he jeopardise this by a chemical attack ? 
  flair doubly checks out, 
  believe it or not , you ca n't actually build a wall between the uk and romania . 
  the wall that / u/stuijfsande is referring to is a metaphor for the common sentiment amongst the british populace that immigration from eu countries is harmful for the uk and that brexit can , in effect , solve that . 
  yes , but you also have to redesign current passenger aircraft , teach pilots how to land on these runways , for safety purposes you can have only one aircraft on the one runway but with many runways you can have many aircraft , and you have no way of expanding an airport . 
  the advantages of this are greatly overshadowed by the limitations in my opinion . 
  well , this is a state election . 
  i believe that in the federal election the `` schulz phenomena '' will be much more present . 
  many people will vote for schulz but not necessarily spd . 
  action on climate change perhaps ? 
  purchasing power has nothing to do with gdp . 
  purchasing power is how much you can get of tangible goods or services with a specific amount of money . 
  this shows that a coffee in finland will cost two times more than a coffee in romania . 
   just because something is democratic does n't make it right . 
  so 51 % voted to leave the eu but they should stay in the eu because it is `` right . '', 
  i really do n't understand your position here . 
  it 's like captain america all over again . 
  according to a poll , 80 % of young people in kaliningrad have been to europe whereas 15 % have been to other parts of russia . 
  i 'm not saying its gon na happen , but feelings might change . 
  the us also supports these following authoritarian regimes : bahrain , brunei , chad , djibouti , morocco , oman , qatar , saudi arabia , uae who happen to not recognise israel . 
  so , why would the us install a puppet government in israel if it supports so many of israel 's opponents . 
  if you 're so into puppet governments i 'd look towards russia . 
  and no , i 'm not talking about trump . 
  i 'm talking about abkhazia , donetsk , luhansk , south ossetia , and transnistria . 
  to add to that , funnily enough , the first country to recognise israel was in fact , the soviet union , lead by josef stalin , the puppet-master . 
  now , i want to state that i do not condone many of the things the israeli and us government have done , especially the treatment of palestinians under the current israeli administration , but i heavily question your belief that israel is a us puppet government . 
  you should n't compare apples to genocides .

  canada is the world 's tenth largest economy with 70-80 % of the economy being in the service sector .

  you must consider the views of the aleepoans . 
  let 's just say the inhabitants of rebel held east aleppo were more than happy to eradicate such factions . 
  this however could change as there have recent ominous reports of wrong doings by the regime as they reentered aleppo,

  most people are familiar with the book but not familiar with its reception in the scientific community nor its scientific criticisms . 
   in response to the growing controversy surrounding the bell curve , the american psychological association 's board of scientific affairs established a special task force to publish an investigative report on the research presented in the book . 
  [ 8 ] in their final report , titled intelligence : knowns and unknowns , [ 9 ] some of the task force 's findings supported or were consistent with statements from the bell curve . 
  they agreed that :  iq scores have high predictive validity for individual differences in school achievement . 
   iq scores have predictive validity for adult occupational status , even when variables such as education and family background have been statistically controlled . 
   there is little evidence to show that childhood diet influences intelligence except in cases of severe malnutrition . 
   regarding murray and herrnstein 's claims about racial differences and genetics , the apa task force stated :  there is certainly no such support for a genetic interpretation ... it is sometimes suggested that the black/white differential in psychometric intelligence is partly due to genetic differences ( jensen , 1972 ) . 
  there is not much direct evidence on this point , but what little there is fails to support the genetic hypothesis . 
   regarding statements about other explanations for racial differences , the apa task force stated [ emphasis added ] :  the differential between the mean intelligence test scores of blacks and whites ( about one standard deviation , although it may be diminishing ) does not result from any obvious biases in test construction and administration , nor does it simply reflect differences in socio-economic status . 
  explanations based on factors of caste and culture may be appropriate , but so far have little direct empirical support . 
  there is certainly no such support for a genetic interpretation . 
  at present , no one knows what causes this differential . 
  it 's a shame that most of the public criticisms centered around the supposed bias and invalidity of iq tests , and it 's also a shame how many people misunderstood the contents of the book - it did not contain sufficient evidence at all for racial determinism . 
  this is the danger of letting scientifically illiterate people read studies and panic all over . 
  you ca n't exactly shop around in the adoption process , and that factor only affects the study that compares upper middle class to lower ses adoptees . 
  not true . 
   dickens and flynn ( 2006 ) analyzed data from nine standardization samples for four major tests of cognitive ability . 
  they found that blacks gained 5.5 iq points on whites between 1972 and 2002 . 
  the gap between blacks and whites on a measure of g had narrowed almost to the same degree , that is , by 5.13 points https://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/releases/amp-67-2-130.pdf, 
  source ? 
  they explicitly did not disregard the origin of the children . 
  did you even read which two groups they were comparing ? 
  the fact that lower stature mothers abort more does not mean that they would give less children for adoption than higher income mothers . 
  there amount of parents choosing to opt out through either means is not equal across income groups . 
  oddly specific study ? 
  it 's a meta-analysis referencing tens of papers from about every corner of recent iq studies . 
  you also seem to be operating under the assumption that there would be a consensus behind your racial determinism without referencing , hmm , say , a meta-analysis that would see if there actually is one . 
  you mean the vanhanen-lynn figures ? 
  they included samples of mentally retarded children , surveys that excluded too high results , and blatantly incorrectly administered tests . 
  if you 'll read the other study i have linked , you 'll notice that excluding methodologically flawed surveys ( either unfavourably or favorably ) and including more recent surveys that vanhanen and lynn excluded gets a figure closer to 80 for sub-saharan africa . 
  and then you have to account all the other factors besides genetics , which are not limited to hdi . 
  do n't get me wrong , i would like to see a study about , say , people adopted from gabon and china in early childhood . 
  but just comparing two countries at their face value , even considering that they have similar hdi , might not be enough . 
   a meta-analysis available at the time of the neisser et al. 
  ( 1996 ) article found an effect of adoption of lower ses children by upper-middle-class parents of 12 points ( locurto , 1990 ) . 
   a subsequent adoption study by duyme , dumaret , and tomkiewicz ( 1999 ) found that the iq difference between children adopted by upper-middle-class parents and those adopted by lower ses parents was about 12 points . 
  look , they clearly specify that the adoptions they studied concerned adoptions that happened from lower - to higher income families . 
  i ca n't bother googling the exact statistics for all adoptions ( which is n't even relevant ) , but somehow i have the gut feeling that lower income families leave more orphaned kids than higher income families , and that higher income families are more likely to adopt said orphaned kids . 
  hell , they even have a minimum income limit for foster parents right there in the federal law . 
  you ca n't just take a correlation and think that it means causation without eliminating the other variables . 
  by that logic , we could just as well say that vaccines cause climate change . 
  it is * not * grasping the straws to require that other variables are eliminated , which many of the studies the article discusses are trying to do - and find that the differences start to shrink when you do . 
  differences in iq do not work that simply though . 
  sure , the difference in iq between , say , a human and a dog is clearly almost entirely genetic . 
  but you simply can not say the same when comparing different groups of humans . 
  there is no evidence that the raw genetic difference in iq between any two groups would even be in the order of 12-18 points . 
  ( this is mostly because it is an overwhelming task to isolate the rest of the variables . ), 
  individuals , likely yes . 
  it 's also worth mentioning that the bulk of the human genetic variance is between individuals and not continental groups , which makes this an even more difficult question to fully answer . 
  and that many groups who europeans view as homogeneous often exhibit the widest genetic variance , a prime example of this being sub-saharan africa which houses more genetic diversity than the entire eurasian continent . 
  a left-wing radical ? 
  which one of the authors ? 
  how does that have anything to do with the scientific validity of the arguments ? 
  the thing is , statistics do not magically change if different people write the articles . 
  author bias only becomes apparent in the analysis , or if they did scientific misconduct ( which you can find by reading the article , not by accusing people without any real life merit ) . 
  and there are plenty of reasons and sources that most adopted kids are from lower-income to upper-income families . 
  it seems to me , overwhelmingly even , that you are the one grasping straws . 
  totally ok to put communists in death camps then !, 
   sweden would at the very least have bent a lot , probably enough to hand in their refugees . 
  it 's for the best that they and their feeble impression of a military stayed out of the way when it would have created a ton of useless victims . 
  another country going poland 's way was not in anybody 's interests . 
  sweden in 1940 is not uk or usa or even france - they can not even deal considerable damage to the offender . 
  but no , let 's just throw more bodies to the grinder because of some hazy moral obligation to fight the baddies even when it causes more harm than good !, 
  of course . 
  i 'm certainly not happy that the people reporting iq studies tend to emphasize their insignificance or test bias , because there are actual scientific reasons not to believe heritability as the main reason , at least as much as certain researchers make it seem to be . 
  from my linked meta-analysis :  we can be confident that the environmental differences that are associated with social class have a large effect on iq . 
  we know this because adopted children typically score 12 points or more higher than comparison children ( e.g. , siblings left with birth parents or children adopted by lower ses parents ) , and adoption typically moves children from lower to higher ses homes . 
  a meta-analysis available at the time of the neisser et al. 
  ( 1996 ) article found an effect of adoption of lower ses children by upper-middle-class parents of 12 points ( locurto , 1990 ) . 
  a subsequent adoption study by duyme , dumaret , and tomkiewicz ( 1999 ) found that the iq difference between children adopted by upper-middle-class parents and those adopted by lower ses parents was about 12 points . 
  a recent meta-analysis by van ijzendoorn , juffer , and klein poelhuis ( 2005 ) found an average effect of adoption of 18 points . 
   ( ... )  one of the most telling of the studies was available at the time of the neisser et al. 
  ( 1996 ) report but was apparently not known to them . 
  this is an adoption study by moore ( 1986 ) . 
  she examined the iqs of black and mixedrace children averaging 81\u20442 years of age who were adopted by middle-class families who were either black or white . 
  the children who were of half-european origin had virtually the same average iq as the children who were of exclusively black origin . 
  hence european genes were of no advantage to this group of `` blacks . '' children ( both black and mixed-race ) adopted by white families had iqs 13 points higher on average than those adopted by black families , indicating that there were marked differences in the environments of black and white families relevant to socialization for iq ; indeed , the differences were large enough to account for virtually the entire black -- white gap in iq at the time of the study . 
   ( ... )  the academic achievements and high occupational profile of chinese and japanese americans have inspired speculation about genetic superiority ( lynn , 1987 ; rushton , 1995 ; weyl , 1969 ) . 
  flynn ( 1991 ) analyzed data from the coleman report for the high school graduating class of 1966 . 
  that large representative sample included a substantial number of asian americans . 
  the asian americans had about the same mean iq as white americans ( actually slightly lower ) but scored one third of a standard deviation higher on the sat than did white americans . 
  sat scores may reflect motivational differences -- for example , taking more and higher level math courses -- to a greater degree than do iq tests . 
  remarkably , chinese americans in the class of 1966 attained occupations of a professional , managerial , or technical nature at a rate 62 % higher than white americans . 
  the picture that results is that asian americans capitalize on a given level of intellectual ability much more than do european americans . 
   we can be confident that the environmental differences that are associated with social class have a large effect on iq . 
  we know this because adopted children typically score 12 points or more higher than comparison children ( e.g. , siblings left with birth parents or children adopted by lower ses parents ) , and adoption typically moves children from lower to higher ses homes . 
  a meta-analysis available at the time of the neisser et al. 
  ( 1996 ) article found an effect of adoption of lower ses children by upper-middle-class parents of 12 points ( locurto , 1990 ) . 
  a subsequent adoption study by duyme , dumaret , and tomkiewicz ( 1999 ) found that the iq difference between children adopted by upper-middle-class parents and those adopted by lower ses parents was about 12 points . 
  a recent meta-analysis by van ijzendoorn , juffer , and klein poelhuis ( 2005 ) found an average effect of adoption of 18 points . 
  https://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/releases/amp-67-2-130.pdf it seems that the environmental components are enormous . 
  you ca n't toss a potential difference of 12-18 points away because you think socioeconomic factors are feelgood bs . 
  https://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/releases/amp-67-2-130.pdf how about you actually read what we know and what we do not know . 
   we can be confident that the environmental differences that are associated with social class have a large effect on iq . 
  we know this because adopted children typically score 12 points or more higher than comparison children ( e.g. , siblings left with birth parents or children adopted by lower ses parents ) , and adoption typically moves children from lower to higher ses homes . 
  a meta-analysis available at the time of the neisser et al.

  a recent meta-analysis by van ijzendoorn , juffer , and klein poelhuis ( 2005 ) found an average effect of adoption of 18 points . 
   ( ... )  it should be acknowledged , however , that at present there is no way of knowing how much of the iq advantage for children with excellent environments is due to the environments per se and how much is due to the genes that parents creating those environments pass along to their children .

  well you said that gypsies are `` totally shit people '' . 
  that seems quite hateful to me . 
  you hate a large group of people because of their ethnicity . 
  how is that not racist ? 
   want to know one of the reasons ? 
  not having the chance . 
  what do you define `` integrating '' as ? 
  i 'm not op , but i define integrating as `` following the laws of the country they live in '' . 
  i do n't give a shit about what people eat , which language they speak or what god they worship . 
  but they have to abandon all illegal cultural or religious practices . 
  domestic abuse , female genital mutilation , forced marriage , honor killings and jihad are all illegal . 
  i do n't care how important these things are to migrants , if they want to live here , they have to follow the same basic rules as everyone else . 
  that 's integration . 
   and if europeans was being refugee and fleeing to middle-east , they would also take them in . 
  not attacking people escaping from wars what ? 
  who 's attacking people escaping from wars ? 
   the biggest racists are gypsies . 
  that would mean that you 're a gypsy , since you 're obviously quite racist . 
   theres the black identity model where they try to deny their color then reject others then accept who they are that 's sounds oddly racist . 
  you make it sound like being black is an illness or something . 
  i think that the cultural clashes are much bigger here . 
  in america , diversity means having a city with a bunch of white , black and brown americans . 
  in europe , diversity means having a city with both natives and immigrants . 
  a white american and a black american have a similar cultural background , while a swede and a somali come from very different cultures . 
  many immigrants in europe have very different values and opinions than the average european . 
  for example , many immigrants have cultural and religious practices which are very important to them , but which are illegal in europe . 
  everyone in finland drinks tap water . 
  actually , i think that racist assholes who condemn entire peoples like this , are the worst kind of people in europe . 
  i see them very day . 
  they 're easy to recognize because they have dark skin , hair and eyes , and many of the finnish ones wear [ very distinctive folk costumes ] ( http://www.ljplus.ru/img4/k/o/kommari_2/romanit.jpg ) . 
  but they live in houses , just like everyone else , not tents . 
  and they have normal jobs , and i 've never heard of one actually telling fortunes . 
  i do n't know how they 're depicted in media . 
  they 're mostly normal people , except that they wear strange clothes , speak a weird language , and have weird rules and customs . 
  well salted popcorn . 
  grand canyon , the great lakes , niagara falls , death valley ,, 
  pretty good . 
  some are a bit rude , but i 've only encountered the polite ones . 
  we never had the chance . 
  finland has always been small and insignificant . 
  until the twelfth and thirteenth centuries finland was an uncivilized tribal society . 
  then it was a poor province of sweden for 700 years , and after that a semi-autonomous province of russia for 100 years . 
  then we managed to become independent , but had to fight two wars to stay that we ( and of course we lost both of those wars ) . 
  and then we had to be all nice and docile to keep the soviets happy . 
  when would we have had the opportunity to conquer enough land to become superpower ? 
  and who would we have conquered it from ? 
  sweden ? 
  not a chance . 
  probably since the end of the ice age or so . 
  finns would probably be the mormonts . 
  a minor people with little power , who always end up in the middle of some big power play between great kings . 
  finns also used to worship bears , which are the symbol of the mormonts . 
  swedes could be the iron islanders , because they 're obviously inspired by the vikings . 
  i guess that would make the russians house stark . 
  and the mormonts of bear island are trapped in between the two just like we have always been between the east and the west . 
  during the first half of the 20th century many finns talked about a [ `` greater finland '' ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/85/suur-suomen_kartta.png ) which would have included many non-finnish regions where people speak finno-ugrics languages . 
  then finland lost ww2 the dream died . 
  i could n't say , i 've never heard of it . 
  those who fought on the communist side in the civil war used to be looked upon much more negatively . 
  for years their family members were n't even allowed to bring flowers to their graves . 
  now they have many memorial monuments . 
  was n't ddr the model country which the east block loved to show to westerners because it was in relatively good shape ? 
  probably that one . 
  i do n't really have an opinion , and i do n't know any . 
  there was a chapter about indians in my history book , it was pretty interesting . 
  it discussed different types of dwellings and sources of livelihood in-columbian americas , as well as the colonization and the present situation . 
  of course , it was a pretty broad description , because the subject is so broad . 
  well , some people say that by counting the cuckoos singing you will now how many years you still have left . 
  so this may just mean that you will live a very long life . 
  here it 's nine different flowers from nine different meadows . 
  and you must n't speak a word while picking them . 
  the left one , i think . 
  low birth rates , many people just do n't want children . 
  i do n't know about sweden , but people here sometimes talk about `` europe '' and `` europeans '' when they mean central and southern europe . 
  yeah , i 've heard so may girls and women say the same thing about egypt . 
  i think that it may be a good idea to just drive everywhere if you 're a woman . 
  i do n't think people here have any attitudes towards them . 
  i do n't think there even are many hindus here . 
   black cat crosses your path means it 's bad luck . 
  here you 're supposed to spit three times over your shoulder to protect yourself from the bad luck . 
  - corpses should always be carried feet first , while living people should * always * be carried head first - if a bird flies in through a window , someone is going to die ( the bird has come to take their soul ) . 
  - if you hear a cuckoo singing , you should count how many times it sings , so you will now how many years you will have to wait for marriage - you should never hand a salt shaker directly to other person , but rather place it on the table, 
  jesus christ , that 's terrible . 
  it 's legal , but the kids have to take mandatory tests in order to make sure that they receive adequate education . 
  i think that this system is good . 
  absolutely . 
  the civil war was nasty . 
  an airplane was flying over europe , when the pilot announced that there was a serious technical problem , and that all luggage would have to be thrown out in order to make the plain lighter . 
  after a while the pilot announced that the plain still was n't light enough , and that it would fall down . 
  one of the passengers would have to sacrifice himself and jump out of the plane , or they would all die . 
  a brave briton stood up , walked to the door , and jumped out shouting `` god save the queen ! '', 
  after a while the pilot announced that the plane was still too heavy , and one more passenger would have to sacrifice himself . 
  this time , a brave frenchman stood up , walked to the door , and jumped out shouting `` freedom , equality , brotherhood ! '', 
  but after a while , the pilot announced that the plain was still too heavy . 
  a norwegian and a finn looked at each other , stood up , grabbed a swede and threw him out while yelling : `` long live nordic co-operation ! '', 
  why did hitler commit suicide ? 
  he received his gas bill . 
   i think you just dont have the `` cafe culture '' . 
  yes , that 's possible . 
  everyone has their own coffeemaker .

  of course you can . 
  watch youtube videos of christopher hitchens debating and wonder how many people his arguing has tipped over from hesitant to atheist . 
  the internal inconsistencies and logical flaws are great attack vectors which most definitely work on many , many people . 
  because you are a great believer in free markets , individual liberty , individual responsibility , strong borders and are distrustful of government . 
  the problem is that very few right wing parties actually do these properly for a variety of reasons . 
  yet voting for actual socialists because a right wing party does not think you deserve to go to whichever public toilet you want ? 
  surely that is dramatic overkill if you genuinely believe the other party will fuck up the economy or allows the country to be run over by people who do not view you with distaste but with homicidal fury . 
  i think of it as deconverting . 
  atheism is not a religion after all . 
  absolutely you can argue and marginalize religion . 
  a very worthy goal and something i thoroughly enjoy doing any time i encounter someone trying to assert religious values . 
  there is no difference between believing in an imaginary being or an imaginary characteristic ( we are the master race ! ) . 
  both are retarded and give you an absolute carte blanche to do the most appalling shit . 
  well , if step # 1 is ejecting such immigrants and step # 2 is voting liberal in next election , the problem seems to be solved . 
  a better strategy surely than just going all `` this is my life now '' to being harassed and beat up by devout muslim refugees . 
   it 's not simple to just reroute it , cause the cables can only transport a fixed amount of energy . 
  the same thing is true of the internet . 
  we just build quite excessive capacity in to the system . 
  the same can be done with energy , and with reasonable enough cost . 
  and yes , since energy cables are bit more restricted it gets trickier . 
  i mean , i assume you know the tricks enron pulled with exactly the stuff you mention . 
  but they did that largely because the us grid was n't mature enough to handle such routing . 
   that sounds like a huge and gigantic waste of resources . 
  who 's going to pay for that ? 
  who paid for the internet ? 
  the government and the consumers ultimately . 
  it 's good value for money . 
  upgrading the net should also allow customers to sell energy to the network regardless of where they are . 
  this would be a true 2nd ( 3rd ? ), 
  generation power grid with tremendous advantages . 
   we were talking about bringing power generation to southern europe , this would mean that there are barely any power plants left in poland . 
  lets not be ridiculously overdramatic . 
  probably more like 30 % of the northern generation at most would move south , and frankly another large clump would head to the atlantic coast for wind . 
   and this would mean if the power grid towards poland from europe gets attacked , then poland as a whole will get a blackout a grid is a hell of a lot cheaper than actual power plants , they can be buried quite deep etc. 
  in any case it 'd be way easier to knock out the polish power plants than to actually destroy the various connections between poland and the rest of the eu . 
  oh and of course , those connections are really quite easy to fix , certainly compared to actual power plants that have had the turbines blown to pieces . 
  i mean lets look at the ( poorly developed and in desperate need of upgrading ) us network : https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d4/unitedstatespowergrid.jpg you go ahead and knock out ohio . 
  stop it from getting electricity with some air raids . 
  and that 's far less populous area than central europe and it 's not a particularly modern network with probably 0 concerns taken for potential impact of air raids . 
  europe could improve on both of those counts . 
  electricity grid is n't some sort of gigantic terawatt pipeline between two countries . 
  it far more resembles the internet , with the strengths that come with that . 
   i doubt any country would see it as a good thing if their heavy industry leaves . 
  germany has a lot of car manufracturer for example . 
  car industry is n't actually that energy intensive . 
  metallurgy etc are ones that tend to require ridiculous amounts and really be driven by energy costs . 
  assuming the cars are still assembled in germany , i do n't think this is a particularly huge deal . 
   of course it 's possible , but it needs a lot of money . 
  the energy that would be delivered would need to be for europe as a whole , imagine how many cables you would need for that and those would go throughout europe . 
  that 's a huge waste . 
  having a unified power grid is far from a waste , it is one of the few ways to allow us to truly tap nature which will always have a major regional impact . 
  it also makes us far more rugged from any sort of terror/war because you can simply reroute until enough of the system gets taken out . 
  with a proper internet style power grid taking out every power plant in poland with massive air raids would not turn off the lights in poland , as they would today , because the grid at large could be turning on extra power plants in the western parts of eu to compensate . 
  this is a huge strategic advantage . 
   no thanks . 
  with the british out , the only countries within the eu where english is already the primary language are ireland and malta . 
  which has the benefit of making it quite politically neutral . 
  also , 31 % of eu citizens say they are proficient enough in english , making it by a fair margin the most widely spoken language in the eu . 
  that 31 % is also very highly concentrated among those that work between countries . 
   it would be more sensible to pick german , french or italian as a primary language but now you 'd be forcing scientists , businesspeople and others that operate on a global scale to learn a new language on top of the one they use to work in asia and with the anglosphere . 
  china going english surely was the last nail in the coffin of some sort of fantasy revitalization of french ( german ? ), 
  as an international language . 
   maybe english should become more like an official second language of every eu country , like spanish is ( afaik ) in some us states , or french is in some parts of ( ? ), 
  this is what i meant really . 
  it being the second language of every country officially would be supremely convenient . 
  it 's pretty close to the status quo already and it 'd mean people moving between countries could trust that they can function anywhere in the eu by knowing one extra language . 
   choosing english as a primary language would probably lead to the decline of a lot of minority languages and thus to a substantial loss of culture . 
  this can happen if the culture is not particularly strong or actively supressed . 
  the latter would not happen in the eu and the former ... well ... 
  i ca n't be too sad . 
  i am not afraid for finnish at least . 
  we 'll manage , and we 'll be more dour than the rest of you bastards no matter how much english we speak . 
  it ** is ** a major problem in terms of currency areas etc. 
  i mean there 's absolutely zero way around that . 
  i think that with the uk out it might be easier to bite the bullet , but i think one of the biggest steps forward for the eu would be declaring english the primary language . 
  that 's the huge bullet france has to eat for eu to move forward . 
  it 's not scorched earth . 
  it 's simply that sometimes economies get really concentrated which means that shocks to those economies create problems . 
  in detroits case it was the car industry , which had been built on us global dominance , not being actually competitive with european and asian rivals when forced to compete on a fair level . 
  you think someone in the us planned it ? 
  there are cities elsewhere on the planet that are somewhat monoindustry . 
  those industries crashing will crash the cities hard , and it seems easier to have the people move to whatever is booming than to try and reinvent the city with 40 % of it unemployed . 
  let 75 % of the unemployed leave and reinvent it without such crazy crash drain and social problems from all the unemployed people . 
  naah , number of easy enough counters there . 
  most obvious one is that energy excess in the south will result in heavy industry moving south to benefit from the cheaper energy . 
  that 's actually quite good and useful , as the north seems to be doing better with the knowledge economy anyway . 
  as for the infrastructure ... germany is being pretty horrible about it . 
  the problem is of political not technical nature there , and europe having a well integrated power grid would be a great way to move forward and enhance europe for the 3rd millenium . 
  also , btw , a fantastic way to stimulate the economy while doing something genuinely useful . 
  war & terrorism ? 
  you realize how much trouble we 'd already be in if particularly spain gets significantly taken over . 
  who the fuck would get there ? 
  and of course france has nuclear etc. 
  any sanely developed power grid would be tremendously decentralized rather like the internet , making terrorism against it absolutely futile . 
  i agree with you that centralization has its problems and i certainly would not like the idea of making poland the bastion of all of europe 's energy , but making spain/italy/france ( with nuclear ) carry the torch to a significant degree until we get fusion working ? 
  that seems strategically perfectly sound . 
   i realise that , but the us population will still be there in 4 years , and they elected him . 
  it was a complicated election with a lot of anti-clinton votes . 
  so i would n't say that americans fell head over heels for what trump represents . 
  still , a healthy quarter probably did , so that 's not so great .

  currently approx 50 % of finnish exports go outside the eu , 30 % to eurozone , and 20 % to other eu countries . 
  like said before in this thread , the only countries with balance of trade with china are finland and germany . 
  the reason why southern countries have had balance of payments and trade deficits is because they do n't export enough . 
  and that is n't fixed by increasing wages in the north to able to buy more olive oil or luxury leather hand bags , it is fixed by creating new exports to new destinations such as china , east-asia , middle-east , india , latin america , etc. . .  juncker is right , many people are so ignorant and selfish that they wo n't admit the obvious . 
  let takes another view . 
  in finland thanks to our choice to have a competitive economy and due to unfavourable natural environment , we have a suicide rate of 17.3 per 100000 inhabitants . 
  in greece the same rate is 2.8 , can we get a rebate from the eu or funds to repair this ? 
  actually not . 
  the metro lines stays in athens . 
  we can also think this other way . 
  the finnish state gives 600 million more to the eu than it receives from it . 
  this 600 million is real money , the state could have build a new metro line with it to helsinki , or actually funded other infrastructure projects with it that are badly needed . 
  or the state could have given the money back to taxpayers . 
  in anyway that 600 million and things that with it can be bought are missing now from here . 
   the language you 're using sounds a lot like the old socialist/communist language - it 's not the people who are against you , it 's the aristocracy/leadership . 
  there 's a hell of a lot of resistance to further integration at all levels of society - most pronounced in the uk but prevalent in every country in varying amounts . 
  that is the case . 
  for example let me take finland as an example , russia is our neighbour that has history of intervening at will , us also has bad habit of doing blackmail and threatening when it suites it , especially in economic matter , big european powers such as france , germany and uk too promote their interests . 
  now if finland would have won seat in the un security council , the seat would have been useless , the country would have voted or abstained based on not making any power angry . 
  so how much real sovereignty there is ? 
  zero . 
  that is what everybody understand , and everybody also understand that spending finite money on something that does n't bring any benefits is n't beneficial to do . 
  maybe with bigger countries such as germany , uk and france there is still a dream that their are influential , maybe , but in the 21th-century international politics will be dominated by super entities like the us and china . 
  nobody else comes close to their power . 
   even the economic factors you mentioned are not certain - time and again centralisation has been heralded as a fantastic cost-cutting measure but has actually lead to inefficiency . 
  something are better done locally , but somethings are best centralized . 
  it is eternal balance between the two . 
   germany spoke out against the iraq war , the uk was all for it ( let 's pretend that country = citizens for simplicity 's sake ) . 
  if there was only the eu representing both then one nation is being massively short-changed . 
  britain would consider the commonwealth to be favourable trading partners , as would the french with the francosphere . 
  if the eu was one massive bloc then this would not be represented ( or , if it was , we would simply be saying `` every nation is a preferred trading partner '' which makes little sense ) . 
  if the whole eu would have been using the euro , there would have been single opinion that is do n't invade iraq . 
  why ? 
  because saddam started to trade oil with euro , which was important economic milestone for the eurozone . 
  unfortunately after the us invaded and occupied iraq , oil is once again only traded with us dollars . 
  in case of commonwealth and francosphere , they are meaningless . 
  china and the us are most important partners in all areas of life to the eu , all other countries and regions are dependent on relations on these two powers . 
  they should pool up their resources . 
  the eu has already done good job in regards of trade relations . 
  the next thing to do should be to pool resources in foreign policy , defence , internal and external security , intelligence , etc. . . those are all things that member states do n't have any real ability to do by themselves . 
  germany is n't going to get a seat anyway . 
  another issue is that does n't have the power at hand that counts . 
  for example if the us decides to invade country x , then it just does it , does n't matter what the un says , in the future the same goes with china . 
  the only thing that the un does is to offer meaningless entities of the international politics to say that they are equals with other powers , when in reality they are meaningless and will stay so . 
  sovereignty is n't an absolute value . 
  the point of a nation state is to serve its citizens , not to aggrandize or promote its bureaucrats or leaders . 
  for small nation states , most traditional state functions are just waste of money , they do n't produce or serve citizens , they just waste money that could be used better , either by returning it to taxpayer or offering more and better services . 
  what nation states need to do is to return to serve core functions of the state , to concentrate on its citizens , to promote the language , to promote the culture , to promote the way of life . 
  these are important things that citizens actually care . 
  and believe or not , most common people actually share the idea , the people who are against it are state bureaucrats and politicians who fear to loose their soap box and tool that they have used to work with . 
  yes please . 
  foreign policy is totally useless for small countries , read countries that do n't have ability to invade other countries at free . 
  it would be better to centralize all foreign policy decisions to the eu and then shut-down or downsize national foreign ministries to bare minimum , not to mention shut-down national embassies and consulates . 
  would save lots of money to do so . 
  unfortunately i think he is right . 
  the problem of banking union is how to pay for it . 
  actually that is two problems because we have to acknowledge that there is two different times , the current crisis time and the post-crisis time and the next crisis time , and all need to be addressed . 
  * in the post-crisis time funds for european deposit insurance fund should come from the banks . 
  however banks are n't equal , they have different legislation and different operating environments that predispose them to different risk levels that should be taken into account when defining what should be the bank/country based insurance payment . 
  * during the crisis time we can safely conclude that troubled banks do n't have the money to pay up any payments anywhere . 
  we can also conclude that troubled countries do n't have the money to pay up for the troubled banks . 
  we should also note that not all countries even have deposit insurance funds , and from those who have , not all funds are equally capitalized . 
  so who is going to pay for it ? 
  if non-troubled countries need to pay it , then they are punished for adopting good policies . 
  * in the next crisis , crisis is an systematic failure of the financial system , the fact is that european deposit insurance fund wo n't be able to cover it , nor is the esm large enough to do it . 
  what to do for example if france and germany would find them in financial crisis ? 
  the current mechanisms would be unable to scope with a crisis that wide . 
  what then ? 
  to go ahead in settling this crisis , we need to address all of these things . 
  i would have rejected also his nomination . 
  where does these kinds of conservatives come from ? 
  if you hold ancient values you ca n't succeed in the 21th-century , actually you could n't succeed in the 20th-century without adopting scientific world view . 
   in germany pensions are ( still ) paid directly ( via tax ) and do n't go the useless detour through financial market speculation which only makes the whole pension system unstable anyway . 
  the problem with that is that the ability of the society to afford pay pensions is directly connected on its ability to collect taxes . 
  with pension funds , part of my pay goes to the fund that then invests it to different investments instruments and markets . 
  it enables companies and countries to access capital that allows them to grow faster , and earning comfortable interest to the fund , allowing savers to invest less to the fund . 
  it should also be noted that thanks to diversification of funds , funds ability to pay pensions would n't be shaken if the finnish state would drift to economic trouble . 
   no if wages would go up the money would stay in europe and would eventually reach spain through higher demand . 
  right now the excess profit money is flowing out of europe ( or into switzerland ) . 
  higher wages would prevent that . 
  most highly developed economies keep around 80 % of the gdp that they produce . 
  less developed and less wealthy economies keep much less . 
  the money already stays here , but again , there is no coercive reason why they would go to spain . 
  money goes to spain if spain produces something that the markets want . 
   like finland has more to offer than nokia phones , spain has certainly much more to offer than apples and tomatoes . 
  also : you could just buy higher quality apples from spain instead of importing low quality from kasachtan . 
  spanish apples are the low quality option , enlightened customers buy finnish apples that have lower amounts of pesticides than ones produces in central , south or east europe . 
  another thing is that one can only buy so much better commodities , somewhere along the line you ca n't any more taste the difference . 
  the thing is that consumers put most of their money to high value items or to services . 
  you need to sell lots of apples to cover one lenovo thinkpad carbon x1 with i7 , or not to mention cars . 
   no we would have to compete directly with american workers on wages . 
  right now for example car companies like ford and gm have factories in europe and in america . 
  without any trade barriers they could instead produce everything in america where wages are lower . 
  and as long as wages in europe do n't fall to the same level they have no reason to come back . 
  most factory work is robotized and in coming decades automation will only increase . 
  already toyota has a new highly robotized plant in japan that can compete in production costs with plants in china . 
  competent engineers , designers and business people on the other hand cost the same in us if not actually even more than in europe . 
  so i do n't really see that us could out compete european manufacturers . 
  not to mention that european manufacturers should increasingly specialize and concentrate on producing high value products and service . 
  in bulk and low value products and services the chinese will beat european manufacturers sooner or later .

  russia does have alot of good tech , problem is they ca n't modernize their entire force , before they planned 70 % of military equipment to be modernized , and now due to sanctions and low oil they have to settle near 30 %, 
  lolno , did you see russia 's logistics in the russo-georgian war ? 
  they ca n't command and control or coordinate that well . 
  not saying they came out of no where . 
  but you can not claim after mass deportation and native emigration influxation thats its defiantiy justified to be invaded . 
  it was a joke because the ussr got kicked out of it and wwii happened . 
  and it also failed to represent major powers such as the usa which did n't join it . 
  the new un made sure major powers had a say in it. ,, 
  nato is a european organization , it was the baltic states and poland ( who are european states in nato ) who called for rotational forces including us forces on their territory , not the us . 
  it was the france ( a nato and european country ) that called for nato support during their africa conflict in mali . 
  sadly even though europe is the biggest economic union , it does not have a common defense and security policy ,, 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/demographics_of_crimea according to this it was above 35 %, 
  the falkland islands referendum was not done under armed military occupation where there was widespread intimidation . 
  no international observors were allowed in crimea during the voting , in falklands it was , and it was n't during a state of crisis like crimea . 
  ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/crimean_status_referendum,_2014 ) 1992 constitutional powers means its autonomous within ukraine . 
  do you really think russia would of let crimea rejoin ukraine after they put military troops there and already dissolved parliament ? 
  i meant the bolshevik government, 
  rip , finland 's in 11th place , must be because of our gun ownership . 
  finland was never a russian oblast , and finland was apart of the sweden before russia , surprisingly invaded and annexed it . 
  and in 1917 tsar russia actually signed finnish independence, 
  the league of nations was the equivalent to the un back then . 
  nato is a european organization , only 2 of the 28 members are outside of europe , ( canada & usa ) . 
  the us is the strongest military in the world , it makes sense . 
  seeing that russia has probably the second military strongest military , it makes perfect sense for us forces to be there . 
  and the 4 battalions being sent to eastern europe , only one of them is american , rest are european, 
  do n't get me wrong , russia probably has one of the ** largest and most powerful land based militarizes in the world , ** but russia 's military is still in the semi-professional stage . 
  russia does have the most conventional artillery and combat tanks in the world , but most of it is soviet-era technology and not kept in the best condition . 
  despite the `` modernization program '' that is taking place in russia , they still suffer logistical issues , and with economic sanctions and falling oil prices , its really only the specialized and elite units of its military that get modernized equipment . 
  could russia occupy the baltics and perhaps poland ? 
  sure , but its defiantly in no position to hold out in long term military operations . 
  skeptical , this decade alot of russia 's collaboration efforts have ~ ~ been stopped by the new world order ~ ~ really failed . 
  * china and russia were suppose to be a thing , yet it really has n't rooted out to much besides weapons deal and stalled gas pipelines * well with the ukraine crisis , there goes all ambitions for the eurasian union * turkey and russia are n't see eye to eye either . 
   `` it was actually majority russian before the deportation '' no you are wrong , before the mass deportations tartars made up 55 % of the crimea population , now their population makes up 12 % . 
  the meijilis are the only political organization representing the tartars , so when they speak out against the occupation you know something is up . 
  ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tatars#crimean_tatars )  the ussr annexed karelia but as you know all the finnish citizens left anyway . 
  dude , they left because russia illegally annexed karelia . 
  russia got kicked out of the league of nations because of their invasion . 
  you ca n't just invade a country , ethnically cleanse all their people and claim `` see there are not natives here , its our land '' . 
  during the continuation war finland fought to retake * the land that russia stole . 
   `` it was actually majority russian before the deportation '' ** no you are wrong , before the mass deportations tartars made up 55 % of the crimea population , ** now their population makes up 12 % .

  during the continuation war finland fought to ** retake *** the land that russia stole . 
  if you did n't notice russia 's economy has tanked now , due to economic sanctions and oil ( the us shale industry has increased production which is one of the causes of increased oil prices ) . 
  what is the uk doing ? 
  trying to jump out of the eu and get stuck into another scotland referendum ? 
  by that i think russia means do n't mess with its ** near abroad . 
  ** * russia did the same exact behavior to georgia in the 2008 russo-georgia war when it seeked closer ties to the west , and russia even annexed south ossetia ( part of georgia ) under the guise of pro-russian forces similar to crimea * russia wants to ~ ~ defend its ethnic population abroad ~ ~ protect its sphere of influence . 
  you need to realize that russia can never carry out the structural reform or has the transparency needed to develop industry to compete with europe or the west of the world , thats why its relies mostly on its former ussr members , either through the eurasian customs union which gives russia exclusive access into their economies while putting harsh tarriffs against all others, 
  you realize belarus is suffering alot more than russian from the sanctions ? 
  apparently the rest of the world does n't . 
  ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/political_status_of_crimea#others ) does n't help russia 's case when countries like cuba , venezula , and north korea only support your cause . 
  as for the legitmacy of the referedum , i 'm fairly certain north korea has held more transparent ones . 
  ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/crimean_status_referendum,_2014 ) 96.77 % , really ? 
  seems very ` legitimate ' . 
  the referedum question itself was bias , it either asked to join the russian federation , or restore crimea to the 1992 consitution powers , which both de facto mean crimea is an ` independent state ' ( except being occupied by pro-russian forces ), 
  before , crimea was majority ethnic tartars ( until stalins purges and mass deportations ) , then during the cold war lots of russians emigrated there during the cold war , as it was a military base and such . 
  when the ussr fell lots of russians stayed there . 
  i think you are focusing too much on crimea , remember that the donbass war is still going on in eastern ukraine ? 
  where actual russian troops are engaging in combat against ukrainians . 
  russia did n't like it which chechnyan separatists tried leaving russia , i do n't see how they justify the current response against ukraine . 
  the sanctions were n't so much over crimea but the changing geopolitical games infused by russian foriegn policy . 
  ironically yes , this started off with crimea , but russia has increased its foriegn policy ambitions in syria , as well as militarization near the baltics . 
  i should add that sanctions will be removed if the minsk agreement ( ceasefire in eastern ukraine ) is successfully done , it does n't include anything about crimea specifically, 
  the sad thing is , russia could of reduced alot of its causalities during wwii if they actually focused on fighting nazism , not trying to invade neutral countries ( like finland ) and suffering a quarter of a million causalities . 
  i agree with toreon . 
  you ca n't just mass deport the local population ( for example , the early tartar population in crimea ) and influx it with your own natives and say its apart of your sphere of influence . 
  i assume russia is not giving back finnish karelia which they stole during the second world war ? 
  victims of capitalism ? 
  the vast majority of former soviet states when they ascend to the eu get a large boost in life expectancy , living standards , and gdp per capita, 
  so is russia going to give back karelia which they stole from finland ? 
  i mean crimea was only given back in 1954 , and russia annexed finnish karelia early 1940 . 
  i find the arguement that just because there are russia citizens there means that its okay for russia the ` mother country ' to annex it . 
  but you seem to forget that crimea before was n't majority russian , it was majority tartar before the mass deportations , during the ukraine crisis the tartar crisis spoke out against the annexation and of course were silenced . 
  same goes for the baltics , you can not mass deport the local population , then influx it with your own and claims its ` yours ' now . 
  rip belarus , they 're suffering more from this incident ( and the oil drop ) more than russia, 
  well there 's that , and crimea has great geographic and geopolitical aspects 1 ) it gives russia another warm water port area ( russia is basically a landlocked nation during winter time ) 2 ) lots of oil reserves in the black sea ... especially near crimea , probably one of the reasons sanctions/blocking investments took place in crimea is to discourage and disable russia from being able to develop infrastructure necessary to possible have the oil industry start drilling there 3 ) most likely russia felt unconfrotable that ukraine was wielding too west , same thing happened to georgia in the russo-georgia war in 2008 . 
  russia annex south ossetia from georgia , sortof as they annexed crimea from ukraine . 
  hi , is finland getting karelia any time soon ? 
  during the cold war , finland was actually in a good economic position , being able to trade with the ussr republics and then also europe , the vast majority of trade in finland is within the eurasian contineent , so i do n't see the big deal , plus finland produces 60 % of the worlds icebreakers so i would n't really say we 're ` landlocked ', 
  finland actually has a vibrant agricultural sector ( yes its highly subsidized , but so its switzerlands ) , with the 2014 ukraine crisis , russia put a food embargo on the eu , and finland ships alot of its food there , since the trade block , low priced food has flooded the domestic market cutting profits from the farmers, 
  our gdp growth is slowly improving , yes we are having stagnant growth , but we do n't have massive layoffs , gdp capita decline , any of that , being in the positive gdp growth is something, 
  i think slowly finland is piecing its economy back together , yeah with the whole situation with russia it kindof sank our growth ( again ) but germany and sweden have overtaken it as # 1 trading partner, 
  ... you know ... you can give back finnish karelia if we 're talking about whats rightfully whose . . 
  in a way we kind of see estonia as our lost little brother that was unfortunate to not escape the soviet wrath in wwii . 
  during the cold war , for at least finland , we were able to trade prosperously with both west & east while keeping soviet external forces at bay . 
  good thing / r/russia is n't as active as / r/suomi, 
  hehe , finland 's flag is over with south america, 
  pls no stormaktstiden, 
  :( we have argentina , we do n't need nordic, 
  do you know if there is a specific subreddit that caters to actual russians ? 
  for example , / r/finland is generally more americanized than / r/suomi that is actually finnish . 
  you did us a great honor . 
  banned for asking about modern day russian opinions on the ribbentrop-molotov pact . 
  i 'm curious , is the standard of living in kaliningrad higher than the average place in russia ( excluding moscow/st petersburg ) or is it about the same ? 
  someone please post this on / r/russia , its worth the ban . 
  how dare you attack their beloved rt news of truth,

  inflation measures the rate at which currency looses its purchasing power . 
  this is tied to the creation of money by our financial institutions . 
  inflation is hence normally tied to the availability of currency , when the supply of currency increases the less value each denomination of that currency has . 
  when a country enters the euro the price increase is faster than the normal rate of inflation as the loss of purchasing power is n't solely derived from the increase of available credit . 
  therefore calling the prise increase just inflation when it comes to countries entering the euro is in my opinion not an accurate explanation of the phenomenon . 
  prises rise die to inflation yes , but the rise in prises we 've seen when a country introduces the euro is not related to inflation and is much faster than the normal rate of inflation . 
  the biggest issue is as you say that companies do increase their prises as people are n't as used to the figures i.e. 
  what is expensive and what is n't . 
  prices will rise like they did in all countries after the introduction of the euro . 
  oh dude ... you just stepped on a ** huge ** land mine in this subreddit . 
  it 's made up by these people and add some pro-eu on top of that . 
  however , anarchism can not fairly be seen as a leftist ideology . 
  per definition they do not want any state at all whilst communism want a very strong state . 
  i have to say that i sadly do n't know much about bulgaria or bulgarians . 
  if this reflects my fellow countrymen i do n't know . 
  but i have neither bad or good to say as i honestly can not say i know almost anything . 
  i shall at least read up more on your country . 
  and people wonder why they should not be allowed into the eu . 
  i find it insane that people think gambling is morally unacceptable . 
  i also think it 's cultural . 
  many countries have horse meat as part of their diet , not as everyday but every now and then . 
  it 's really tasty and good . 
  the lady in pink is hot . 
  meh ... he 's just too much . 
  i like him , but he 's not the right guy to be the pm . 
  horse meat is so good . 
  never understood the scandal . 
  how come so much crap is allowed in food in the us ? 
  i mean this is n't the only unhealthy thing they allow in food there that is banned almost everywhere else . 
  south korea was a surprise though . 
  if someone would have asked me i would have guesses at least top tree . 
  i was thinking the same thing . 
  never knew about them having coding for kids , that freaking amazing . 
   but it is really different thing to pay a lot of taxes so that a complete stranger 200 km away from you can benefit this is how we fundamentally think . 
  i know that in 99 % of the time i 'd not even be closely related or know the person who gets to enjoy the benefit but i do n't care . 
  some day i or someone close to me might need it as well . 
  nothing to do with nationalism or patriotism , it 's not like i feel that it 's a thing i do for my nation . 
  thank god someone got me . 
  cos we like to be drunkiesshshss, 
  i applaud you , as it feels nice to hear it come from someone that does n't represent a majority christian country . 
  this , what you 're saying is very much how many people feel . 
  the extent to how it is the reason for sweden getting this score in this measurement i do n't know . 
  non the less an important discussion . 
  that 's the spirit . 
  lol and we 'd get great weed and hookers . 
  start draining that damn thin already !, 
  but ... that 's not fair . 
  his username sound ... well like one of the `` stans '' which makes it even more weird ... hmmm ... 
  that 's why we prefer scotland ... ,

  sounds like a quote from weeds . 
   ... and science are hardly worth mentioning i am happy to take criticism but i recommend you revisit that statement and look up some facts . 
  if he was american he 'd call us liberal , gay and tree hugging socialist pacifist hippies . 
  it makes you a pickled egg that smells surstr\u00f6mming . 
  i do n't agree with the racism thing . 
  just swedish media that went ape shit over it as they did with the finnish swastika pastries that are actually stars . 
  no it 's not just the best analysis i could come to . 
  i mean there 's no real answer to how certain sociological behaviours occur . 
  one thing we do know is that climate and natural resources affect the way societies were formed . 
  but the rest is just speculation . 
  ooooo just imagine if you got 1 cent form every sperm cell . 
  i 've literally flushed down millions :o, 
  maybe ... if you promise you 'll be more willing to play and share your toys and not just be grumppy . 
  [ oh belgium , they 're so silly ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceg6nqkhd70 )  jokes aside i can very much see what you mean .

  [ think that boat has sailed ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/94/fredrik_reinfeldt%2c_statsminister_sverige%2c_under_sessioen_i_kopenhamn_2006.jpg ), 
   sweden has one for sure , for better or worse . 
  in deed , they just changed their mansions to spraying champagne on people at stureplan . 
  can we send our snobs there as well ? 
  please . 
  but greenland is n't independent per definition ... so you still got hope . 
   `` we dont see ourselves as better than other people - we just live slightly into the future '' thing is , even if we know that we 're doing well in some areas most nordic people do n't think they do . 
  we always feel like second best and nothing is ever good enough . 
  seriously sometimes i 'm amazed how negative we are about our countries . 
  i do this myself . 
  this is why i move abroad every now and then and when i move back i can appreciate things . 
  but after a while you 're back to square one . 
  so northerners that have n't lived abroad very much will never think that they are best . 
  even if we win something in games , become first in a comparison of countries people just say `` meh ... that 's just a fluke we 'll loose that spot next year anyways ... '' . 
  i mean it is truly depressing if you think about it . 
   which i think goes away if you stick around . 
  this is very true . 
  i 've lived in a few countries and different cities and at first it is all exiting and new , then you just become a part of everyday life a peg in the wheel that is every day life and the grind . 
  it is at that point you really start to learn the culture , the life , the ups and downs of an society . 
  now unfortunately i 've not lived in slovenia so i can not really say anything about your country . 
  finland takes the price on being negative over its achievements . 
  the only thing they genuinely admit they did well was to not loose their independence to russia . 
  otherwise as soon as some good news pops up about us doing well in one thing , there are three articles the next day saying that the measurement was flawed because of a , b and c or that if we do n't do c , d , e well be doomed . 
  ffs enjoy the good new sometimes and not just when we do well in ice hockey . 
  interesting , i 'll have a look . 
  thanks . 
  yes please . 
  named as in jack , bob and charlie . 
  i wish , 
  to be honest , sometimes i wonder myself . 
  i mean looking at our politicians you wonder how they know their ass from their elbow . 
  sure we 're doing well , and we are being portrayed as some super success stories but it is n't all a dance on roses . 
  but if i 'd try to analyse it i 'd say that : i think what helps us is that we have since a long long long time ago had to rely on each other women and men alike . 
  before the convenience of modern technology you had to have someone to help you carry logs so you would n't freeze your ass of in the winter . 
  food was hard to come by and we had to rely on each other .

if arendt is to be believed , stalin 's regime did attain full totalitarianism , but it was rather hastily disassembled after khrushchev came to power . 
  the cult of stalin 's personality was repudiated by khrushchev and there were no antisemitic conspiracy theories ( such as the doctors ' plot ) or major purges after 1952 , which were all crucial components of a totalitarian regime . 
  of course , it depends somewhat on how you view the concept of totalitarianism . 
  i think it 's safe to say that post-stalinistic soviet union was still authoritarian and terrible , if not essentially totalitarian . 
  nazi germany and the prc before deng xiaoping 's reforms . 
   the target of the action , or whatever that means in grammartalk . 
  that 's generally referred to as the sentence 's [ object ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/object_%28grammar%29 ) . 
  it is the same thing with certain dialects of the karelian language . 
  there is no hard break between the karelian and finnish [ isoglosses ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/isogloss ) , and many western dialects of the karelian language are mutually intelligible with finnish . 
  i partially agree , although what constitutes a fair share is highly debatable . 
  feminism , at it 's most basic , is the idea that women are people in all the same respects as men . 
  in my experience this is how most feminists see their movement . 
  granted , there are a few crazy types too , but they usually have personal problems or are doing it for shock value . 
   sex organs exist so that we can procreate . 
  there , you made the naturalistic fallacy again . 
  granted , reproductive organs have evolved to facilitate reproduction . 
  that does n't indicate what they should or should n't be used for . 
  to argue so would be fallacious in the aforementioned way . 
  now you gave me synonyms , which all happen to be very different words . 
  can you give it any meaning that is distinct from ` natural ' ( ` useful ' , ` principal ' , ` main ' ) or ` ordinary ' as in the most common ( ` expected ' ) ? 
  define ` normal ' . 
  if someone points out that homosexuality exists in nature , they are refuting the premise of your earlier , fallacious argument , not making a fallacy themselves . 
  you are clearly dodging a question now . 
  before , you stated that homosexuality is unnatural and therefore wrong . 
  what do you think about this claim in light of the links and the quote i posted ? 
  we 'll get to homosexuality being a disorder after that . 
  there is no ` biological viewpoint ' to ethics . 
  there is no particular ` purpose ' to life , and attempts to derive ethics from nature are innately futile . 
  what you made was an [ appeal to nature ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/appeal_to_nature ) , the rhetorical application of a [ naturalistic fallacy ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/naturalistic_fallacy ) . 
   even if we can agree that some things are natural and some are not , what follows from this ? 
  the answer is : nothing . 
  there is no factual reason to suppose that what is natural is good - or at least better - and what is unnatural is bad - or at least worse . 
  from whose viewpoint ? 
  pseudo-darwinian vulgarity ( ie . 
  we must propagate since the species must survive ) does n't count . 
  and , dog breeds are the result of intentional breeding that is aimed towards producing maximum physical variation . 
  comparing them to human variation is a * very * bad analogy . 
  in fact , subspecies or other species-specific groupings do not really exist in the wild because of constant gene flow . 
  natural population always vary dynamically if there are no hard geographical borders . 
  this is obviously the case with humans too . 
  when you hear a biologist talk of ` subspecies ' , they will be referring to a fictional abstraction that helps them in labeling things . 
  just like race . 
  except that with humans , labeling based on fictional categories does n't help anyone . 
  dogs are a * very * bad example since dog breeds are result intentional breeding . 
  natural populations within a species vary dynamically . 
  this is also the case with humans . 
  defined subspecies do n't exist in the wild . 
  they are fictional abstractions that help biologists in labeling things . 
  and labeling based on fictional abstractions is not a good thing when applied to humans . 
  this is basically a nordic thing . 
  although i agree with the statement that race is a meaningless , unscientific concept , many other countries define racism as ` discrimination based on race ' . 
  it 's sad , but it 's true . 
  the usa , for example treats the existence of ` race ' as a simple fact . 
  it 's shocking how racial ideology permeates their society so deeply they do not even see it themselves . 
  you 'd prefer the * ancien r\u00e9gime * , then ? 
   how people live their personal lives is none of the government 's business . 
  it 's a big deal exactly because of this . 
   abnormal behavior yes , because ` abnormal ' ( statistically underrepresented ? 
  nonconformant ? ), 
  is the same thing as * bad * . 
  i think you mean islamists ? 
  they do n't have the organization , the motivation , the chance to political hegemony , the industrial base or the numbers . 
  so no , i do n't think so . 
  those seem like fair points , and i agree with you that everything should be done to combat the threat of extremism . 
  i do think the radicalization of muslim youths is a problem , and a serious one . 
  enabling islamism is probably a huge problem for the islamic world at large . 
  the point i made was that ` muslims ' as an unchanging abstraction is n't sufficient explanation for islamist extremism , as you probably agree . 
   perhaps you 've missed the fact that violent islamism actually exists . 
  i think you 're the one who 's stubbornly refusing to comprehend anything i do n't spell out in front of you . 
  did you read the second paragraph of the last message i just wrote ? 
  yes , i 'm questioning whether violent and organized islamism exists in the extent you and anti-jihadists claim . 
  yes , i 'm comparing eurabia to the elders of zion , since they are both conspiracy theories made possible by the malleability of factual knowledge in a postmodern , information-rich society . 
  no , i 'm not claiming anti-jihadism and anti-semitism are wholly analogous . 
  no , i 'm not claiming violent islamism does n't exist . 
  no , i do n't like you either . 
  behave like a product of the four thousand years of western civilization you are and do n't bring name calling into a civil conversation . 
   * of course . 
  * why did you make such a generalization , then ...  * they did n't do anything in the name of their religion . 
  * ... especially if it so much contradicts this ? 
  the funny thing is , that from a common early 20th century viewpoint , the jews actually * did * . 
  the stab in the back and the conspiracy of the elders of zion were facts in early 20th century europe , just like the violent nature of islam and the eurabia conspiracy are considered to be in some circles today . 
   * i made no analogy at all . 
  * arguably , you made a counter-analogy by negating his . 
  a bad choice of words , perhaps , but my argument stands . 
   * hyper-pc * this is just a common mantra that shows your desire to denounce me as some kind of political * bien pensant * . 
  stick to real arguments , please . 
  just like germany denounces every swastika scribble anywhere ever . 
  right ? 
  the * vast * majority of muslims would never do anything like this . 
  the jews were n't accused of terrorism - they were accused of soiling european blood , of being rich and greedy , of stabbing germany in the back . 
  any anti-semite could produce copious amount of evidence for this , pretty much like every gates of vienna reader can today against muslims . 
  your analogy just does n't hold water . 
  or drunks . 
  or pretty much anybody else , since we have no way of knowing , as you pointed out . 
  yes , i agree that the hungarian hypothesis seems more credible . 
  that does n't outright mean some kind of back formation was impossible - etymology is often * very * complex and seemingly irrational . 
  my original statement was basically just a wild hypothesis . 
  as i said , i 'm not particularly versed in hungarian or romanian linguistics . 
  and i 'm not arguing from a political perspective at all . 
  yes , i 'm aware of that .

  i reasoned that not all follow stuff like / cityporn etc. 
  photography , and as the riverfront of budapest rivals london riverfront , but is less known , it should be presented instead of the village . 
  luckily the rebuilding is faithful to the original :  it was decided to build a bridge as similar as possible to the original , using the same technology and materials . 
  the bridge was re-built with local materials by er-bu construction corp a turkish company , using ottoman construction techniques . 
  tenelia stone from local quarries was used and hungarian army divers recovered stones from the original bridge from the river below . 
  i thought about budapest , which is immensely beautiful , but i wondered it is so recognizable that maybe i put some lesser known place from hungary . 
  now i kind of regret . 
  how do you feel ? 
  i kind of laughed at it when going trough them . 
  `` too much cathedrals !, 
  too much castles !, 
  too much palaces !, 
  too much old cities ! '', 
  old world problems . 
  art deco was kind of futuristic , and yes , that is art deco . 
  you can see some similarities in the use of strong geometric patterns and gradients colors in this art deco painting : https://booksandreviews.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/tdl38.jpg, 
  apparently a part of kazakhstan is in europe , on the western side of ural river , which is understood as the edge of europe . 
  yea there are tons of them , but i realized that europe has so much historic town centers that when you put them all on the same gallery , they do n't stand out from each other . 
  same with castles , cathedrals and fortresses . 
  too many of them !, 
  ( but all beautiful still ) that 's why i chose the more unique ones . 
  yea , i included it specifically because it is so bizarre . 
  prague is a unesco site also , but everyone knows it already , and that chapel was really unique . 
  well lapland is a natural , not a cultural heritage site . 
  and there 's only one site per country to this list !, 
  some countries have only a few while italy has 50 so i made it fair and took one from each . 
   eu is not the trade partner , some member countries of eu are . 
  yea , but by eu i mean other eu countries as a group . 
  the majority of finnish exports go to other eu countries . 
   how exactly talks are going to get ukraine to peace ? 
  you should ask that from our president . 
  do you think politicians will tell all their diplomatic discussions out to the public ? 
  confidence and trust are needed , so naturally they are not going to tell what they are speaking in private . 
  and niinist\u00f6 only has said that he wants to have an open communication , not that he is there to push for peace . 
  and the quote you said says this :  to my understanding the statement of kremlin refers purely to trade statistics , which show a slight declining trend , purely speaking on numbers . 
  unlike how it is usually understood , that is not about crumbling relations , niinist\u00f6 said . 
  so , what about that ? 
   so they will try to pressure ukraine , mostly because russia is main trade partner and also because russians do n't give a shit . 
  actually most of finlands exports go to other eu countries . 
  the main trade partner of finland is the eu . 
  under 10 % of finnish exports go to russia . 
  the sanctios have had only marginal effect on the finnish economy . 
  `` they will try to pressune ukraine '' is your imagination . 
  niinist\u00f6 clearly said he is on the eu side and supports the actions of eu , so whatever he says to ukrainian president , it 's close to the view of eu . 
  politically yes , geographically apparently no , but as `` europe '' is so much a cultural and political term instead of just geographical , yes , cyprus is part of europe . 
  kind of like denmark is part of scandinavia , even though it 's not * geographically * part of scandinavia . 
  fixed , thanks !, 
  [ alanrickmanvoice ] do not disappoint me , future . 
  whatever the first mention of the city is , they are not always said in sources , as several sources themselves do not date the beginnings of the city to the first written records of it . 
  historical research does not have a consistent criteria on how to determine the beginning of some city , so i saw no reason to differ from that . 
  history uses several different sources for determining the age of a city . 
  written sources is one , but if all archaeological findings point that urbanization has happened before first written record , historical research can not ignore it , and neither did i. 
  by googling colchester seemed to be older , and i always aimed for the oldest one i could find . 
  i actually do n't feel it is even almost cheating . 
  to my understanding several buildings we now consider old have been rebuilt during their history , like something is built in 1200 ad , it gets destroyed in 1500 ad and is rebuilt identically in 1550 ad . 
  from our perspective ( or from my perspective ) the building still represent the original one , even though it is not . 
  of the hundreds of years of history , ( and hundreds of years to come to riga ) , the few decades the building was demolished is just a glitch when seen from future . 
  to us it might feel cheating , because the rebuilding happened in our age , not in history . 
  but in the future the rebuilding is also part of the long history . 
  perhaps i 'll make another post about old cities with surviving old architecture , as the oldest cities not always have their old architecture . 
  it was kind of annoying googling the cities and finding out that many of the cities that probably are the oldest do n't look old , and some younger cities actually have older architecture . 
  would be more eye candy . 
  it 's difficult to be consistent , as when looking at information the sources are n't consistent . 
  they say `` this city is the oldest because it was first mentioned already in xxxx '' whereas with some other city it says `` this city is the oldest as archaeological finds confirm continuous urban settlement since '' . 
  ok , thanks for the info !, 
  i replaced nijmegen with maastricht . 
  didi n't understand the link but i take it you read it from there , and the list apparently is also about the age . 
  well i tried to get the oldest one if possible , and while sitguna might not look that old , based on the info i saw it is older than visby . 
  but visby sure does look magical !, 
  thanks for the info !, 
  i replaced enns with salzburg , as it seems to have been unified by romans in 15bc to a city , and got a roman city status at 1st century ad . 
  all i could find points lisbon being the oldest city , while other places that now have cities might have had settlements older than lisbon , but the info does not state that the settlement has been urban like . 
  wikipedia lists them , as part of them is in europe . 
  it 's what i found out seem to be the oldest and still inhabited . 
  it 's not a choice but what i came up with the best information i found . 
  this is not a list about cities that * look * old . 
  some cities might have all of their historical buildings demolished or bombed , but the city itself still exists . 
  the criteria is in the disclaimer . 
  goal was n't to find the best preserved city , but some of the oldest cities . 
  sometimes the earliest record is the date of founding , sometimes the first mention in written history , sometimes archaeological findings . 
  sometimes an archaeological dig proves some city is older that some that has been mentioned earlier in written history . 
  as said in the disclaimer , i looked these up by googling . 
  for example sighisoara is better preserved than mangalia , but mangalia dates to the ancient greek times , while according to wikipedia sighisoara dates to medieval times . 
  i just saw some post somewhere about `` words that do n't exist in other languages '' with the explanations and saw schadenfreude there and thought `` hey , we have that too ! '', 
  there 's also a common words `` paskah\u00e4t\u00e4 '' and `` kusih\u00e4t\u00e4 '' in finnish that i have not encountered in other languages . 
  they mean `` shit emergency '' and `` piss emergency '' and are * de facto * words you use when colloquially informing where you have to go . 
  i do n't know german , but i do know ( or think i know ) that `` schadenfreude '' is the word for enjoyment of the bad luck of others . 
  finnish has it too , `` vahingonilo '' , literally `` the joy of accident/misfortune '' . 
  thanks !, 
  i updated the texts !, 
  i mean , turku is my birth city for god 's sake . 
  no way i would forget that !, 
   niinist\u00f6 can talk all day about solidarity with in the eu , but that does not actually mean anything . 
  talk is cheap , especially coming from a politician . 
  yea , but has he said or done anything that is against the policy of the eu ? 
  he is keeping with the eu line . 
  but they ruined the view with a [ modern bridge ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3e/kirjastosilta,_aurajoki_ja_turun_tuomiokirkko,_kuvattuna_it%c3%a4iselt%c3%a4_rantakadulta,_turku,_8.12.2013.jpg ) : /, 
  i knowingly ignored if the city previously has been mentioned been `` inhabited '' and took as a criteria that the settlement has been `` town like '' , not only people living in the area . 
  that 's why i chose to take the risk to be too inclusive instead of too exclusive . 
  if there is ambivalence i do not want anyone relevant to feel left out .

  instead of paying that money in taxes , i could take one years vacation , do nothing . 
  so who does that differ from conscription , government takes one year worth of my time every year ... from my point of the only difference is that instead of being called private , i 'm called mr. senior consultant . 
   furthermore , on the note of taxes , everyone already pays for the security the military provides , so it 's not like the general population is not contributing to general security . 
  equipment is only a small part of the overall expenses . 
  in case of country like finland either we are going to pay for a standing army of somewhere around 50k to 100k to be ready to fight against an possible invasion or we are going to have an conscription based army that can be assembled and put to fight quickly if needed . 
  and before you start with , `` see you can just pay for the defense , everything can be voluntary '' , then i have to make note that armies that are professional armies like the us army , the people who fight the wars come mostly from lower income segments of the society . 
  joining the army for many of them is `` voluntary '' . 
  a conscription based army is much more equal , everybody needs to contribute and anyone can be on harms way . 
  not to mention that machiavelli had many excellent points about professional armies that are still true even today . 
  a conscription based army is more loyal to the country and nation that it serves than a professional standing army . 
   conscripts are nothing other than fodder in a real war . 
  if you want your country defended you 'll raise taxes and buy proper equipment , not inject more bodies into the meat grinder . 
  you ca n't never ever replace foots in the ground with equipment . 
  not to mention that to make that equipment to become a credible fighting force you need people in the ground , and a lot of them if in case one is to mount credible defense against a country such as russia . 
  you do know that one could also make the same case about taxes . 
  why do n't we make taxes voluntary ? 
  do you see any problem with that ? 
  the thing with taxes is that they provide common services for everybody . 
  if paying taxes would be voluntary then there would be people who would get all the gains of having an organized tax paid society around them without paying for it . 
  conscription based army is the same as taxes . 
  everybody enjoys from the security that the army provides . 
  if conscription would n't be mandatory , then some people would be providing the security and others would enjoy of it without contributing for it . 
  a good healthy society ca n't function for long if its members are n't contributing to its up keep equally . 
  in case of security , conscription is one of the most equal ways to provide . 
  in case of other things modern societies need , taxes are the way for everybody equally to contribute . 
  as a citizen you both have rights but also obligations . 
  in many countries who take their ability to defend their country seriously there is conscription . 
  i went to finnish army for 9 months , some went for 6 months and some for 12 months . 
  while i would have preferred not to go to the army , it is a cheap price to pay for our continued freedom and security . 
  in finland we have saying , country either has its own army or the army of its enemy . 
  i prefer having our own army in our own country . 
  hmmm ... 
  but are eastern european societies really egalitarian ? 
  because when one looks with them for example throe [ hofstede dimensions ] ( http://geert-hofstede.com/countries.html ) they all seem to have very high power distances , and high power distances are n't good sign when looking for equality in society . 
  for example denmark has one of the lowest power distances 18 , when romania has one of the highest 90 , and czech republic 57 . 
  actually when i compare top 10 happiest countries , what they all share are low power distances and high individualism . 
  is that so ? 
  [ world happiness report 2013 ] ( http://unsdsn.org/resources/publications/world-happiness-report-2013/ ) ... [ and with pretty pictures ... ] ( http://edition.cnn.com/2013/09/09/business/earth-institute-world-happiness-rankings/ ) rankings ... * denmark * norway * switzerland * netherlands * sweden * canada * finland * austria * iceland * australia, 
  there is an report for that ... [ global gender gap report ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/global_gender_gap_report )  the report examines four critical areas of inequality between men and women in 130 economies around the globe , over 93 % of the world 's population :  * economic participation and opportunity -- outcomes on salaries , participation levels and access to high-skilled employment * educational attainment -- outcomes on access to basic and higher level education * political empowerment -- outcomes on representation in decision-making structures * health and survival -- outcomes on life expectancy and sex ratio and as one could guess , the nordic countries are at top !, 
  who could have guessed !? 
   in case west vs. east , you ca n't really make that comparison , but it seems that nordics , central european countries , and anglo-saxon countries are leading . 
   here 's the thing : populism is ugly , but it works . 
  populism does n't work , at least when it is put in action . 
  just look at latin america , rampant populism has lead many of its state come failed states from venezuela to argentina . 
  populism can make you win elections , but it is not good for the people when put into action . 
  fuck gazprom and fuck kremlin . 
  we should declare total economic war against russia . 
  we should blockade the whole country , no imports , no exports , no money transfers , no nothing . 
  when the people hang putin and his cronies and torch the gazprom headquarters we can return to normality . 
  otherwise we should treat them as an hostile power and wests global power to sanction any third party that does business with them . 
  lets drive them into bankruptcy and keep them there until change comes . 
  edit : not to mention we should ban entry of any gazprom employee or their family members to us and eu and confiscate all their property . 
  [ borat - throw the jew down the well !!, 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vb3imtjjzfo ), 
  one thing to factor if you would like to study in finland is that you need to have enough money to live a year in here in order to get a student visa . 
  currently the finnish state has defined that amount to be 6720e per year or 560e per month . 
  all other eu countries all so probably has this same legislation , but of course the amount of money needed varies . 
  another thing that i would ask you to consider is what is your plan when you finally start to study and what after studies ? 
  if you study for example in finland or sweden , it is absolutely necessary that you become fluent with the native language during studies , i mean almost like an native speaker , if you do n't then you will have hard time finding work that matches your education and potential from the country you studied . 
  that is unfortunate truth . 
  hope so . 
  i really ca n't understand why these tanks could n't be sold to saudi arabia , they are going to get them anyway from either us or from the americans so it would be better if it would be from us . 
  even better if they are going to be manufactured in spain , less need for bailouts , 
  from the polish border there is only 590km to kiev , and 700km to tallinn . 
  are you really claiming that the german air force could n't effectively operate from polish bases ? 
  both eurofighter and tornady have flight distance of 1390km . 
  yes the sorties would be limited like you said , but they still would be effective . 
   the example of ukraine , which has massively underperformed even belarus , shows that worshipping western ways and plaintatively clutching at their lapels is no panacea . 
  i 'm only commenting this because this underlines the biggest fault of the current russian political leadership ... approx 75 % to 80 % of the russian federal budget comes from oil and gas revenue when counting the service sector to the figure as it is also largely funded by it alone , gas and oil directly contribute 50 % to 60 % of the federal budget . 
  the reason why russia has been able to become more developed is because of oil and gas revenue , but this is n't real development . 
  what is there left is you take all the oil and gas revenue away ? 
  not much . 
  another thing to note is that the only reason belarus has n't collapsed and sinked even lower than ukraine is because russia supports the regime with both funding it directly and giving it discounts in oil and gas prices . 
  there is no development at all in belarus , with out russian support it would be more poorer than the worst parts of ukraine . 
  from this point and this point alone i usually ca n't understand any support for putin and other people in kremlin . 
  they are wasting russia 's resources and opportunities for real growth and real development . 
  germany and other european states do n't need aircraft carriers , air fueling , cruise missiles or accuracy ammunition to protect ukraine and baltic states . 
  what they need is friendly bases and to move their military assets to the designated targets . 
  any air war that is conducted in ukraine , belarus or baltic 's can be handled from german and polish air bases . 
  not to mention armored brigades can easily conduct operations in baltic countries and ukraine , the supply lines are not long . 
  the red army was on the brink of their abilities to continue on . 
  if the us would have dropped two atom bombs to moscow and leningrad , it would have destroyed the whole communist leadership opening the door for the collapse of what was left of the regime . 
  not to mention that the us had material advantage and well rested troops , if they had rearmed what was left from the wehrmacht they could have easily drove the red army from central europe . 
  why did you make a point about libya when the whole operation was about force projection and not about conventional war ? 
  germany has n't ever had force projection abilities and uk and the french have made some investments , but not substantial . 
  in case of operation in ukraine it would n't be a force projection , but more akin to conventional war using friendly bases near the target . 
  seriously , do you vote for putin because he truly represents your world and political views , or is it because there are no better alternatives ? 
  world would have been a much better place if instead of hiroshima , usa would have dropped atomic bomb instead of hiroshima and nagasaki to moscow . 
  it would have been better for everybody , even for russians themselves as all the communists and their offspring would have been wiped away from the face of the earth . 
   90 % of the assets used would have to be american where does this claim come from ? 
  during the cold war the main fighting force of nato in europe would have been the bundeswehr , not the us army . 
  this still holds true , germany is still geared towards traditional land war in europe . 
   opposed the banks which were squeezing those in debt ( moratorium on taking away the house if you ca n't pay , converting swiss frank loans to forint at an unfavorable rate ( should be 1 chf = 240 huf , but they introduced a law saying the bank has to exchange it at 1 chf = 180 huf ) , special tax on the banks is that even legal ? 
  what is wrong with the equipment of the finnish army ? 
  air force and armored units are if not good then at least adequate . 
  we are talking about confidence in here . 
  if any eu/eurozone state can be invaded and occupied without eu/eurozone states together acting against the invader and liberating occupied territories and punishing the invader , then there is no confidence that it could n't and would n't happen again and again and again until there is no eu/eurozone . 
  that would mean that international markets could n't truest that euro has any value . 
  if euro does n't have any value then eurozone members ca n't buy gas , oil , commodities from global markets , it would be the end of the european economy . 
  this is not comparable at all .

   this fearmongering of `` we need to bailout the banks first '' should stop . 
  we need to bailout the people , not the banks . 
  imf has been trying to convince cyprus ' president to let the two biggest problem banks be restructured - laiki and bank of cyprus . 
  imf proposal was that in those banks the big deposits would take a haircut of some 30-40 % . 
  that way the small insured deposits would be secured up to 100 000 $ ( i.e. 
  bailing out the people , if you like ) . 
  but if those two banks fail uncontrollably everybody loses a lot , and it would take long time to sort that mess to see who gets what and when . 
  and it would n't end there as other cypriot banks with exposures to those two banks would be seriously hit and probably fail uncontrollably too . 
  and then people with money in those banks would lose their savings etc. 
  it would be a ultimate disaster for cypriots . 
  last weekend cyprus ' president rejected the imf proposal . 
  but since then they have had the good sense to actually put laiki under restructuring . 
  now the big question is what happens to bank of cyprus ? 
  and the second biggest question is why is cyprus ' prez so heavily opposed to restructuring it ? 
  ( personal savings ? 
  rich pals ? 
  what ? ), 
  while president anastasiades has been wrestling with christine lagarde the eurogroup meeting has been rescheduled multiple times . 
  was to start at 18:00 but latest estimate is 22:00 ( now ) . 
  edit : no . 
  the eurogroup meeting has been postponed again . 
  atm anastasiades , van rompuy and barroso are having another meeting . 
  no hurry , no pressure , by all means take your time ... edit2 : ok , it 's on . 
  i reckon they 're going to need more of that pizza tonight : http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/guardian/pix/pictures/2013/3/24/1364155231872/0add822e-9b73-4795-a621-5dbeaf3a93a3-460x259.jpeg edit3 : no . 
  the eurogroup meeting has been postponed again !!, 
  perhaps even until monday morning . 
  instead yet another meeting with anastasiades , van rompuy and barroso . 
  must be difficult . 
  edit4 : ok , it 's on . 
  the eurogroup meeting starting . 
  president anastasiades just tweeted #eurogroup will start in 15 mins . 
  `` efforts are intensifying , '' he added after several hours of talks and a tantrum of resignation . 
  the word is that deposits in bank of cyprus will get up to 40 % haircut , but insured deposits guaranteed up to 100 000 $ . 
  that 's essentially the same deal that anastasiades rejected last weekend . 
  week of wasted time . 
  edit5 : it 's a deal . 
  the eurogroup accepted the bailout package . 
  http://www.financialmirror.com/news-details.php?nid=29244 but will the parliament approve it ? 
  resigning would be the nuclear option . 
  that would lead to stopping the ecb 's emergency liquidity assistance . 
  and indeed the two problem banks would then fall ( laiki , boc ) . 
  but without liquidity to help fencing it would spread and many other cypriot banks exposed would get into serious trouble and probably fall even without the looming bank run . 
  it would be the ultimate worst case scenario for cyprus . 
  why is cypriot gov so insistent about trying and saving the bank of cyprus ? 
  why ?? 
  k , sorry mate !, 
  man , what is this , srs turned into a bot ? 
   planck results stolen by americans thanks merkel . 
   the finns would rather be in a union with russia than sweden . 
  nope . 
  we even fought wars to fend off a union with russia . 
  generally , i do n't see much point in a nordic union as we already are in the same union ( sans norge ) . 
  the window of opportunity for a nordic union just is n't there any more . 
  it was open perhaps in 1930s and maybe in 1990s but not any more . 
  now it 's just a useless idea . 
  makes more sense to work together in the union we currently are in . 
  yep , the communist president made some very poor decisions : http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/dec/19/demetris-christofias-cyprus-sorry-state, 
  some interesting points from iceland : [ can cyprus do an icesave ? 
  the short answer is `` no . '' ] ( http://uti.is/2013/03/can-cyprus-do-an-icesave/ ), 
  i hope they do listen to this : [ cyprus bank chiefs urge parliament to pass rescue package ] ( http://www.financialmirror.com/news-details.php?nid=29235 )  the chiefs of the island 's two largest lenders , bank of cyprus and cyprus popular bank ( laiki ) have made a dramatic appeal to parliament to approve a package of eu-imposed rescue measures that include a levy on savings that should prevent a banking sector default . 
  ...  `` it should be understood by all , especially the 56 members of parliament , that from the minute it was obvious that there was no alternative , there should be no further delay in the ratification of the eurogroup 's proposal on the introduction of whatever levy on banking deposits above 100,000 euros , '' said bank of cyprus chairman andreas artemi . 
   i want to celebrate this outbreak of common sense . 
  and common sense it is . 
  but i 'll celebrate only when/if cyprus accepts . 
  last weekend they rejected that proposal . 
   guess what happens when banks open after doing haircuts ? 
  correct , bank run and bank sector collapse . 
  here 's the list of options without a possibility of a bank run : * that list has been empty since at least january , probably even for a year . 
   now that russia does n't want to bail them out alone ( though they did extend their older loan and lowered interests which is a win for cyprus ) well , russia never said they wanted to bail cyprus out anyway - and honestly , ca n't blame them for that . 
  already in january they said that rather eu and cyprus should carry the biggest burden of the bailout , and that they might help a little but only with `` certain conditions '' . 
  very good indeed if they gave an extension on their loan to cyprus . 
   i believe that cyprus 's best action course is to do what eu fears the most , get out of the eurozone and start printing its currency . 
  yeah hyperinflation and all of that , but at least it will be in their control and can pull it off . 
  besides , may attract a lot of investors since they become cheaper . 
  fwiw : i do n't think so . 
  the proposal of restructuring those two banks included guarantee for insured savings up to $ 100 000 , and the uninsured big deposits would have taken the haircut . 
  and that 's exactly what 's happening to laiki now , and probably will happen to cob too . 
   how 's that good ? 
  there have been no `` good '' options left for a long time . 
  troika 's proposal of restructuring the two problem banks was one of the sanest options left . 
  instead of rejecting it , it might have been better to take troika 's offer as a basis , to refine it in details and to start doing that necessary restructuring a week ago already - as it 's gon na happen anyway . 
  troika 's proposal to restructure the two problem banks laiki and bank of cyprus was not ridiculous at all . 
  considering the circumstances it was quite sane . 
  yet cyprus rejected it . 
  now that cyprus on it 's own accord has already decided to restructure laiki and it seems probable that cob is next , it seems that it might have been better to take troika 's offer and do that necessary restructuring a week ago already . 
  christofias did make some very poor decisions indeed : http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/dec/19/demetris-christofias-cyprus-sorry-state  now either cyprus accepts the deal , forces eu to offer a better one , or throws another hissy fit and burns the few remaining bridges . 
  i do n't think there will be a much better deal from troika - some cosmetic enhancements perhaps . 
  the situation has deteriorated from last friday , and the square one we 'd be going back to is worse than last week . 
  i think rejecting the proposal of restructuring laiki and bank of cyprus was a big mistake , probably based on hopeful thinking . 
   or driving down the eventual price russia will acquire cyprus for . 
  right , the infamous `` certain conditions '' - as in january : [ russia 's medvedev : help for cyprus only if conditions met ] ( http://uk.reuters.com/article/2013/01/28/uk-eurozone-cyprus-russia-idukbre90r08120130128 ) apropos , my prediction ... 
  according to https://twitter.com/financialmirror bank of cyprus ceo kypri :  damage already done , up to us if it is irreparable reports of boc on verge of default are `` untrue '' there 's no importance if we do n't take the right decision today better to lose the battle than to lose the war maybe we should go for depos haircut . 
  better for hit on banking sector than whole economy or maybe you should have made that decision last weekend already . 
  i do n't understand why cyprus rejected the idea of restructuring the laiki bank in the negotiation last friday , but * now * is going to do just that . 
  and it indeed is a necessary and sensible step , but would have been even better not to first reject it and then do it anyway few days later . 
  bank of cyprus next , perhaps ? 
  if so , then it will be like the original troika proposal of restructuring those two banks to cover cyprus ' share of the bailout . 
  my prediction : eventually cyprus will have to restructure the other big problem bank too . 
  this will cut further from the needed $ 5.8 bn . 
  would be ironic as that was the original proposal by troika last friday - to restructure the two biggest problem banks while cutting 30-40 % of big uninsured deposits and protecting the insured ones .

  the syrian government is much worse than the rebels as shown [ here ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_massacres_during_the_syrian_civil_war ) seeing they 've committed much more mass murders and in greater causality scales than rebel groups have . 
  if trump gets elected and he refuses to defend the integrity of nato both houses of congress will no doubt turn on him . 
  there are well above enough establishment based republicans in his own party that would rather impeach their own president than tear down a century of us foreign policy . 
  you can not deny that his close advisors * have * ties to russia one way or another . 
  and his advisors have openly shared their opinions about russia . 
  finland shares a bigger border with russia than the rest of the eu combined . 
  in all honesty the best you can do is to keep open dialogue and slowly scale defensive infrastructure . 
  it was / s, 
   they boycotted the referendum . 
  it was n't exactly the best referendum ever held to put it mild , however they have wanted one since the dissolution of the ussr and ukraine never gave them one . 
  dude , there was boycotting but not that widespread . 
  having 96.77 % is a ridiculous amount . 
  seeing that tartars make up around 10 % of the population , ethnic ukrainians 24 % . 
  having a referendum in a region where no osce or international observers were permitted to monitor the referendum , while under ** armed occupation ** clearly throws the referendum out as illegitimate . 
  and the general assembly of the un overwhelming ruled the referendum as illegitimate . 
  and only countries such as cuba , syria , and north korea recognize the referendum . 
  not even china recognizes it . 
   had their been a fair referendum , the odds are a large majority would 've voted for russia . 
  ( though not in the 90 % range , mor like 60-70 % ) i can say the same thing . 
  russia new they would not get crimea legitimately . 
  so thats why they had to do the referendum under armed occupation without osce or international observers to judge the fairness of the referendum . 
  it was n't even recognized , smh . 
  because occupying a region with military troops and having a referendum in the next day is a totally legitimate way to calculate popular vote . 
   so what . 
  props to putin for that . 
  he could n't do it better , and i honestly think thats genius . 
  you realize that poland is in europe too right ? 
  you seem to be a kremlin bot by wanting to self warm your own countrys well being . 
   either ** usa ** or fsa has done that , as it was extremely convenient for them , and totally against goverment interests . 
  this here is the only speculation in this post . 
  alright you 're obviously a kremlin bot . 
  you are really subscribing to this ridiculous conspiracy theory ? 
  its not fair that you can dispell any judgements and not hold yourself to your own standards . 
  ** assad is clearly worse ** than the rebels , by just looking at the list the syrian government killed more of its people times over than the rebels . 
  its a pretty clear sign of it being unfair , as it has been rightly called . 
  seeing that there are american , german , british , and canadian soldiers in eastern europe they provide the perfect tripwire . 
  it would be insane for any country , especially the united states to back off when 1,000 of your own troops have been attacked . 
  some us politicians were calling for war with iran when they captured some us sailors . 
  surely a thousand dead us soldiers is going to spark some ass kicking of some kind . 
  germany does n't have any choice . 
  germany is the heartland of the eu , if the eu feels threatened it has to respond to its members needs or watch the entire european project break down . 
  in this current situation germany is providing the soft power and the united states is providing the hard stick if everything goes downhill . 
  france and the uk have a bigger military budget than russia , germany comes close . 
  france/uk spend less than 2 % of their gdp on their military , while russia is spending anywhere around 5.0 % -5.5 % during economic upheaval and unrest , and can not even match western countries spending . 
  there 's a difference between appeasement and not trying to stir up the pot and make the situation worse . 
  without us support no doubt western countries would have to take a bigger role . 
  but more or less likely any increased russian aggression will result in the us in keeping the rest of nato in line and obligated to their security guarantees . 
  for example the rotation of 4 battalions in eastern europe . 
  the us can very easily supply all four of those on battalions with its own troops , but it wants to make sure europe has some skin in the game and blood to spill incase things go downhill so it wo n't have to take chief responsibility of the situation such as in ukraine . 
  its true sweden has not been in a full out war in 200 years but sweden has most definitely been involved in the geopolitics of conflict in europe . 
  sweden had to make several compromises for its neutrality in the second world war . 
  it had to transport the 163rd german infantry division through swedish rails to norway for the eastern front . 
  and sweden had to continuously sell its iron ore to nazi germany . 
  and granted , sweden participated and helped finland by sending volunteers and ` unofficial ' military equipment to finland 's aid in the winter war . 
  i personally do n't think the reason sweden has been at relative peace for 200 years has much to do with how it carries itself as a nation ( although sweden is a model for democracy and peace ) . 
  but more or less likely just luck and geopolitics . 
  think about it . 
  sweden was the only nordic country that did not get invaded during ww2 . 
  iceland got occupied by the allies . 
  norway and denmark were occupied by nazi germany steadfast . 
  finland tried following the exact same foriegn policy approach as sweden did during the second world war but nothing could convince the soviets otherwise and finland had to fight the grueling winter war and later the continuation war . 
  ( in finland we view both wars as one ) look at this [ map . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sweden_during_world_war_ii#/media/file:sweden_locator_map_1942.svg ) if finland fell to the soviet union and was annexed as a puppet state . 
  do you really think sweden would of avoided war ? 
  nazi norway and soviet controlled finland share a border together , and no doubt sweden would be a warzone as finland was during the eastern front , adding onto that the critical swedish ore mines that nazi germany had to protect the supply of . 
  even during the cold war , sweden secretly maintained close ties with the united states in fear of the soviet union . 
  the famed `` mysterious submarines '' that have been engraved in swedish culture during the cold war were mostly nato submarines in the west of sweden such as the a-1 polaris in exchange for a security guarantee . 
  the us also had a helping hand in developing sweden 's saab 37 viggen and anti-submarine capabilities . 
  more or less likely donald trump is just ignorant , his advisors are a different story : http://talkingpointsmemo.com/edblog/trump-putin-yes-it-s-really-a-thing, 
  many of donald trumps advisors have ties to russian businesses . 
  http://talkingpointsmemo.com/edblog/trump-putin-yes-it-s-really-a-thing this had a very good detailed article on it . 
  its no mystery that russia tends to fund separatist and anti-establishment groups throughout europe and the western world . 
  if you look at some of the main euro-skeptic groups , like national front for example , its scary how passive they are on their russian policy . 
  even in the united states , there is tangling within the system . 
  ( us news rumors that putin leaked dnc files to give donald trump a boost ) . 
  and yeah , with donald trump in the us threatening to disband nato , and seeing that some of his advisors have connections to russian business , thats scary . 
  sadly populism has no bounds of reason . 
  russia has no friends , not even really long term partners . 
  cuba and venezuela are too far from reach of russia 's influence , and have little reward but a lot of risk . 
  belarus is just a cannon fodder infront of nato , and lukanshanko and vladimir putin are best of friends , its a relationship of necessity . 
  lukanshanko needs subsided oil to keep his regime up and russia needs a buffer between the west . 
  belarus is smart enough , after ukraine , to try to press off russian pressures to add an air force base in their territory . 
  russia needs china more than china needs russia . 
  granted at this rate china will not need to mass import russian oil and russian military technology in a decade or so . 
  i 'm not entirely sure how russia and turkey will have any meaningful relationship . 
  both russia and turkey are solid on their stance on syria , i see no real way for turkey to give up its regime change goals in syria which is the underbelly of turkey . 
  its probably just more pr for domestic media back home at russia and a boost from isolationism in the international community . 
  may i recommend a [ book ? 
  ] ( https://www.amazon.com/mindset-psychology-success-carol-dweck/dp/0345472322 ), 
  plot twist : europe switches to 100 % renewable energy . 
  russia loses its entire federal budget . 
   hail the royal tits, 
  well thats not fair , you can say the same exact thing about brexit . 
  and we * know * how that turned out . 
  either way i find it baffling that [ nearly 97 % ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/crimean_status_referendum,_2014 ) of people in crimea voted that way . 
  seeing there are the tartars and some ethnic ukrainians who are against russia . 
  but what is done is done . 
  it really has done no good , seeing that only countries with horrible human rights records even [ recognize ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/crimean_status_referendum,_2014#reactions ) crimea 's secession . 
  there 's a difference between refugees and the rebels fighting assad . 
  the refugees overwhelmingly are not in support of assad .

they ca n't nest etc. 
  in the water . 
  here 's another recent finnish protest from a week ago . 
  against austerity . 
  state media has reported that finnish authorities regard e.g. 
  northern and southern iraq and the kurdish areas as safe to return to . 
  so there 's probably little chance of them getting a permanent residence . 
  former residents of bagdad , babylon and nineve have a better chance . 
  indeed . 
  these white ghosts scared me . 
  do n't remember other frights related to moomins . 
  alfred j. kwak series on the other hand ... brr or how about this * warning of fragile ice to kids * . 
  music only , no speech , but hits like a truck . 
  good catch . 
  moralism is definitely close to heart in the western sphere . 
  usa is extreme in some degree , sweden quite much so too when you look at what international image they strive for . 
  like this recent debacle , not forgetting that sweden is at the same time almost the highest per capita arms dealer in the world . 
  finland being governed by sweden is revisionism . 
  being sweden could be more appropriate since finland and the whole idea of nationalism did n't exist for the vast majority of time spent under the same royal . 
  read and weep : only 45 tanks in operation : http://cornucopia.cornubot.se/2011/10/insatsorganisation-2014-endast-45.html air force ca n't do dispersed ops any more : http://chefsingenjoren.blogspot.se/2010/07/lfs-2025-del-2-flygbassystemet.html http://wisemanswisdoms.blogspot.se/2008/12/origami.html no extra crews ( neither tanks or jets ) when it 's time to bring out the stuff from the stockpiles . 
  stockpiled tanks would take up to a year to refurb into operative condition . 
  training of the extra crews estimated 1-2 years based on the first link . 
  yes , it used to be much easier to rob the elderly etc. 
  clueless people with heavy cash holdings and currency-based loans with surprise devaluation . 
  why so few ? 
  is it usual ? 
  in finland i think i went through a few hundred rounds in 2 months of basic training . 
  many also continue at a similar rate for the rest of 4 , 7 or 10 months . 
  so it could get closer to a thousand maybe . 
  nordics at the least have a huge amount of hunting weapons . 
  pistols are not very common , mostly due to draconian permit scheme . 
  this proves that the difference between the usa and europe is nothing close to what op might have envisioned : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/number_of_guns_per_capita_by_country, 
  not even close to matching finland . 
  it 's higher tech on average , but it 's a numbers game when you have that much ground to cover . 
  take a look , here 's literally 1/7th of swedish army . 
  which city are you going to defend ? 
  http://www.6mannen.se/wp-content/uploads/7bat.jpg [ google translate ] ( https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=sv&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=fi&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.6mannen.se%2fdebatten-som-dog%2f&amp;edit-text= ) this for context : http://www.6mannen.se/debatten-som-dog/, 
  sweden is key to holding the baltic sea , which is russia 's closest route to west ( st. petersburg < -  moscow ) . 
  finland . 
  but it is n't black and white . 
  was it ever under russian rule or just the czar ? 
  success only until russians actually started meddling ? 
  they do n't know if you wo n't tell . 
  both cities are chock full of foreigners so you would n't exactly stand out . 
  if you 're interested in more digging , try forest finns . 
  people from savonia and other parts of inland finland make up a large part of the population in northern sweden . 
  besides the native sami ofc . 
  large numbers of forest finns went also to american colonies . 
  for example the traditional american log cabin is an export from finland . 
  it came with these guys . 
  but it 's for sale . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/spanish_aircraft_carrier_pr%c3%adncipe_de_asturias though it has a sister which was built for thai navy , so you could be thinking of that . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/htms_chakri_naruebet india bought a russian carrier baku a decade ago . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ins_vikramaditya then they started on their first new carrier , vikrant ( with help from russians ) . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ins_vikrant_ ( 2013 ) for the next one , vishal they want catobar tech from usa , which is far from certain to happen . 
  interestingly enough they still have a ww2 era carrier , but it 's due for decommissioning in 2016 . https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ins_viraat_ ( r22 ), 
  airbus could 've easily had even more problems . 
  see for example : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nhindustries_nh90#concerns_over_performance, 
  there 's also the possibility that they 'll favor american because ideally they 'd like a tech transfer in the future for carrier production . 
  vikrant really has n't been a runaway success and they probably have identified that russians might lack the necessary knowledge themselves to carry indians forward . 
  for vishal they 'd require plenty of tech which really only the americans have . 
  yes , this could be seen as a malfunction of the tradition of consensus . 
  in this realm of politics some people feel like that the consensus has n't been allowed to be challenged . 
  so i guess the perception of the weight of the problems grew and it was treated with nonchalance ( `` first they laugh at you , then they ignore you ... '' ) . 
  then it found its way to the ballots . 
  the failure of other stakeholders to treat the newcomers appropriately has certainly increased their organisation and provided a source of growing sympathy . 
  media and other parties were more willing to vilify the newcomers rather than address problems or even admit them . 
  so they are both a result of the establishment 's action and inaction . 
  like weneedtofederalize described the danish setting , it 's my opinion that it would 've been wise to actually house-train them to obscurity much earlier . 
  at least in finland the popularity is largely seen as a contra-business as usual vote more than pro-whatever these new guys claim to represent . 
  the old left/social democrats are also victim of their own success . 
  they 've done whatever they set out to do starting in the early 20th century . 
  now they lack a world view to the future . 
  in finland they are in progress of extinction due to 0 draw among the youth . 
  i predict leasing gripens will be quite likely outcome by looking at the recent procurements .

  linus torvalds [ aug 10 , 2012 ] ( https://plus.google.com/+linustorvalds/posts/luhjmwpagvi ) `` q : how do you know you are in the middle of nowhere in finland ? 
  a : sometimes your cellphone downgrades from hspa to 3g . '', 
  the great northern war started the reversal of fortunes . 
  as long as the eu keeps adding more countries the harder it becomes to centralize . 
  for example turkey was for long seen as an opportunity that ca n't be missed . 
  but imagine the trouble it would entail . 
  maybe we should prioritize other things than expansion ? 
  verhofstadt 's two layer eu mentioned in limitlessltd 's comment could work ...

  the reservists seem to be doing fine as far as peacekeeping missions go . 
  actives are mostly assigned to training the semi-annual batch of 2x 12,5 k recruits . 
  air force and navy obviously has some active soldiers flying jets etc. 
  that serve in a similar role than in professional armies . 
  since they are nato-compatible they should be very similar to other n. european units . 
  there 's been talks of reducing the reserves to 250k . 
  but that does n't mean the training would become selective . 
  large reserve participation seems to align well with high willingness to defend in case of an attack even if the outcome is unclear . 
  supposedly 76 % agree . 
  obviously if the reserves were mobilized the military would also seize a crapton of boats , cars etc. 
  to support the logistics . 
  you can go to a local military center and ask if your car/boat is already on the list . 
  emergency preparedness is probably one of the best in the world in finland ( with switzerland ) . 
  it 's based on high participation from the private sector .

  my fav : idiom : `` juosten kustu '' literal translation : like pissed while running meaning : something made very sloppily and in hurry -- as if someone had urinated while running , instead of stopping at the side of the road and taking the time to relief himself in the normal manner . 
  ( the new nokia phone is again like pissed while running ! ), 
  or `` quit beating the dead horse '' . 
   not surprising that that 's not the way it 's seen in finland but that is how it 's seen in sweden . 
  well , i do n't remember what was taught at school , but any finn with a basic understanding of the country 's history would likely concur with what you wrote . 
  the only important difference in finnish historical writing is that when referring to sweden before the 19th century , many use the term of `` sweden-finland '' , because it 's important to remember that sweden then also encompassed the present-day finland . 
  many laymen however tend to forget that finnish nationalism was n't really born before the 19th century . 
  they like to think that finns were first `` oppressed '' by swedes and then russians , while actually the oppression did n't start until 19th century under imperial russia as a reaction to our nationalist movement . 
  it 's not fair to compare sverigedemokraterna ( sweden democrats ) to perussuomalaiset ( sannfinl\u00e4ndarna / true finns ) . 
  although the parties current policies , aims and methods are quite similar , sweden democrats -- unlike true finns -- bears the burden of formerly having people affiliated with neo-nazism in its high ranks . 
  true finns -- on the other hand -- have always drawn a strong distinction from nazism , and enjoy a much wider popular support . 
  my opinion is that this is thanks to their more successful appeal to traditional social democratic values , while strongly disassociating from anti-democratic movements like nazism . 
  while sweden democrats have definitely tried the same , their stand has probably not been as credible thanks to the historical burden .

  the man loaded the stolen goods on a ridable lawn mower , and rode some 10 km in the dark of the night to kes\u00e4lahti . 
  there , after running out of fuel , he broke into another summer house , where he again stole property -- including a gardening tractor with a trailer , on which he loaded the stolen goods from this house . 
  he also took the family 's blueberries he found in the summer house 's freezer . 
  riding away with this combination of vehicles , the suspect started to feel tired and fell asleep in his mode of transport at the side of the road . 
  passers-by notified the police , and the sleeping male was apprehended . 
  the man has admitted his deeds in questioning . 
  the stolen goods were mostly recovered , except for the blueberries that the man ate for himself .

  thank you , what an interesting read . 
  while in lithuania i only tried the high-volume commercial varieties like different types of svyturys . 
  fascinating that there is even much , much more to lithuanian beer . 
  as for the law of not selling beer after 10pm , i was thinking it has to be something new because when i was in lithuania a few years back , i think we were able to buy beer late into the night from the supermarkets . 
  wikitravel has it the law came into effect only in 2009 . 
  i find it regrettable if other northern european countries are following the anti-beer hysteria prevalent in scandinavia . 
  in finland the hysteria has done terrible damage to our beer culture , although it has recently been in recovery . 
  yet , planned new legislation ( not allowing beer stronger than 3.5 % to be sold in markets ) might still prove devastating for the small breweries . 
  btw i would still think kvass is a special type of beer , but i guess it 's ultimately just a matter of taste and opinion . 
  well , kvass is a type of beer to my mind anyway . 
  i recognized the 1 litre plastic beer bottle that i learned are very popular and ubiquitous in the baltics while bike-traveling there . 
  i love how people in the baltics still have respect for their beer , as it 's the best refreshment after a long day of biking . 
  in my country , it 's illegal to sell beer after 9pm except in bars , the common beers are of terribly low quality , and in the popular opinion beer is demonised as a `` nasty '' and `` forbidden '' drink .

  i agree , but i understand the bbc is financed through a tv license . 
  that is archaic , as it makes no sense in the modern times - almost everyone anyway consumes public broadcaster content via tv , radio or online . 
  many people will try to evade the fee and then get really annoyed at the inspectors , and the enforcement also costs money . 
  finland moved to a mandatory public broadcaster tax a few years back , the size of which depends on your total income , and i think it 's working pretty well so far . 
  the tax is paid along with your normal income tax .

   i did n't state this as an example of what happened to me no , you claimed that your daughter was a victim of this crime and went on a dramatic tirade about the surrounding circumstances . 
  the rest of your comment bases on an assumption that because i refuse to believe your daughter was killed by breivik i am one of those `` euro-folks '' who have no consideration for the victims of terrorist attacks and think a rightful punishment for terrorism is a slap on the wrist and some rehabilitation .

   environment that makes it difficult to offer stock options to workers not sure how is that possible . 
  some tax issue ? 
  pretty sure a company is free to offer its stock as it pleases . 
   lack of emphasis on teaching coding in the education system generally scandinavian countries are far higher educated than the us .

  europe is about christianity as much as middle east is about islam . 
  they have many other religions and surely no one would connect middle east with islam ... 
  if the borders are closed the reward of reaching europe would be smaller and risk would be bigger , i think that many immigrants would give up if reward is smaller than risk . 
  they may be poor and desperate but they are n't irrational . 
  if europe closed it 's borders do you think migrants would keep crossing the sea just to die with no hope of reaching europe ? 
  just because they 're not white does n't mean they 're some animals who keep coming driven by instincts .

  russia 's cumbering of timber sales to finland is not a new thing , the high export tariffs were one of the reasons it took 19 years for russia to join wto .

  rents in helsinki are n't that nasty if you look at just one room apartments , but if you have multiple rooms , they quickly shoot up . 
  still , you can rent a single room apartment for 2/3 of what you pay in helsinki elsewhere in uusimaa . 
  and even in helsinki , refugees tend to be concentrated in low income areas , where rents tend to be lower than average . 
   the very vast majority of refugees live in areas with so expensive rents . 
  roughly [ 3200 ] ( http://yle.fi/uutiset/joka_kolmas_turvapaikanhakija_asuu_uudellamaalla__katso_asuinpaikat_kartalta/8449935 ) ( 5600 if you count the neighboring municipalities with higher-than-average but still lower rents ) of the current 25300-ish asylum * seekers * live in helsinki . 
  i could n't find statistics saying either way , but you 'd assume that the majority of people with asylum wo n't be moving around that much in a still unfamiliar country once they 've settled down . 
  at least initially . 
  if you have reliable statistics saying otherwise , i 'd be interested in seeing them . 
  you using helsinki , which has the most expensive rents in the country , often 2x or 3x of most of the rest of the country , as the example is pretty disingenious , since the vast , vast majority of the unemployed people with asylum would n't be getting anywhere near that amount of money as aid for rent . 
  so your claim that `` every refugee '' gets $ 1,100 has no basis on reality . 
  even then , the social services will only pay 80 % of your rent , and if you have a rent so big that you 'd get $ 650 , they wo n't be paying it for too long before you 'll be `` kindly suggested '' to get a smaller and/or cheaper apartment . 
  besides , you 'll have to pay everything that goes over that $ 650 from the basic social security , so you wo n't exactly be living like a king . 
  also , none of this is `` without conditions '' . 
  you 'll have to have a valid reason to get social security benefits . 
  you 're expected primarily to look for work or education . 
  ** and , of course all of this only concerns the [ roughly 25 % ] ( http://www.migri.fi/about_us/statistics/statistics_on_asylum_and_refugees ) of the asylum seekers who actually get an asylum . 
  ** which was around 1800 people last year . 
   and every refugee is paid $ 1,100 a month without conditions in finland , so life is already relatively good even if you do n't work . 
  [ that 's absolute , unmitigated bullshit . 
  ] ( http://www.pakolaisneuvonta.fi/index_html?lid=90 ) if you 're an asylum seeker , you 'll get just under 300 euros per month , which you have to buy food , clothes and other necessities with . 
  if you 're granted an asylum , you 'll get normal social security/unemployment benefits until you can find work . 
  with / r/europe being in the state it is , i ca n't tell anymore if this kind of misinformation is malicious or just misinformed . 
  i hope it 's the latter in this case . 
  and ireland is one of those catholic countries . 
  looks like that example you posted talks only about us military veterans . 
  the [ cdc in the us ] ( http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/ice/ice95v1/c26.pdf ) seems to think international statistics are fairly accurate for developed countries :  for the more developed countries , the evidence presented here indicates that such national data achieve acceptable standards of reliability . 
  i very much doubt many 1st world countries have an aversion to reporting suicides reliably in statistics though . 
  they might get covered up on personal level , of course . 
  especially in catholic countries . 
  well yeah , if you know the lingo the press uses for suicide . 
  every time there are the words `` kuoli \u00e4killisesti kotonaan '' , which translates to `` died suddenly at home '' , in the news , it 's pretty likely that the person being talked about commited suicide . 
  if you 're so panicked about immigration that that will decide who you vote for , you deserve everything you get . 
  unfortunately rest of us get dragged down too with the sinking ship . 
  we in finland are seeing that up close right now , with the populist and anti-foreigner finns party in the governing coalition . 
  they were all `` for the working people '' when they were campaigning , and now they 're shitting on workers with the rest of the right wing parties in the coalition . 
  a couple of tens of thousands of asylum seekers is small potatos compared to the fact that the right wing parties will have a free reign in setting up the laws to favor the employers and big business . 
  they already tried to pass a law to make tax evasion easier for investors , but luckily the plan failed because of the backlash . 
  their next big thing is changing the constitution to limit privacy protections it provides . 
  will be interesting to see what else they might try to sneak in . 
  the same circus will no doubt continue while people are distracted by the scary brown people . 
  `` you 'll get what you order '' , like the finns party 's campaign slogan said during the parliamentary election , funnily enough . 
  to be fair , fast-talking someone into buying a stolen phone is a lot easier if you both have the same native language . 
   these people are running from war yes , but the majority are men not women and children as they present it . 
  what seems to be often forgotten is that it 's also completely logical to send the healthy young man from your family to make a long dangerous trip . 
  ** especially ** when you know that women making the same journey risk being mistreated . 
  if they manage to get asylum when they arrive , they can then apply for family reunification to bring the rest of the family to safety . 
  no doubt there are quite a few economic immigrants among the asylum seekers , but just the above alone tends to skew the arrivals towards young males already . 
  i have to agree . 
  a good bit of investigative journalism there . 
  they managed to interview victims and police officers on the ground too . 
   the far right ** pro whites ** feminists * versus * the regressive left and ** muslims ** ? 
  so , how is this compatible with `` islam is not a race , so hating muslims is n't racism ? '', 
  your real agenda is showing . 
  besides , the muslim immigrants and refugees in europe are far too fragmented and sectarian to form any kind of an army outside the wet dreams of you `` culture warriors '' . 
  right ... `` we had to destroy european culture to save it '' , amiright ? 
   the entire situation looks like a right wing party 's wet dream . 
  which is why the right wing parties should exercise caution before they take everything that 's being said as fact . 
  too often when something seems too good to be true , it actually is . 
   ca n't wait for conspiracy nuts to call it a false flag operation . 
  no need for a grand conspiracy , or false flag - anything . 
  police officers are people too , and they have opinions on politics . 
  some things that were made up to support an individual officer 's personal position could have slipped into that report . 
  obviously , i 'm not attempting to minimize what happened . 
  it 's obvious that multiple things went very wrong . 
  now we just need to determine what they were and make sure that the rule of law will be respected in the future . 
  the helsinki one turned out to be a false tip from people belonging to a different sect than the supposed criminals . 
  turned out to be a false rumor started by people from a different sect than the supposed perpetrators . 
  the police is suggesting that , not huffpo . 
  i 'm well aware that they often like to put their own spin on things , but this does n't look like one of those times . 
  the last time `` german men '' behaved like this was in ww2 . 
  the reason i used the quotes is that it was a small percentage of german men . 
  and this was an even smaller percentage of the male immigrants/refugees in europe . 
  and , if you think the refugee crisis is somehow an actual threat to the german culture , you lack all sense of proportion . 
  germany has 80 + million citizens . 
  they could take many times more refugees and still be the majority in their own country . 
  not that it would make much financial sense . 
   but they count on people like the american you replied to knowing nothing about the legal process . 
  it 's not just americans , to be fair . 
  people do n't tend to know much , or care to know in the first place , in finland either . 
  there are constant rumors about what kind of things and how much money the asylum seekers get from the state , and the concepts of immigrant , refugee and asylum seeker are freely conflated . 
  it does n't even help to correct people , when unfounded rumors heard through a third cousin 's classmate 's coworker are trusted more than the official data . 
  because fear is a handy leash you can use to lead people around . 
  it works everywhere else . 
  why not on the estonians ? 
  well , to be fair , he 's a law student and not a history one ... 
   lion eats 4.5 kg + during winter in sub zero weather ? 
  this particular stork will use more energy than usual just to maintain its body temperature . 
  depends on everyone 's personal threshold for amazement , i guess . 
  of course assad would like to stay in power . 
  given that he is n't exactly the best person to have in power either , i ca n't really blame anyone for not wanting to fight for him . 
  and , secularity is no doubt a good feature to have in a country , but it ca n't be the only benchmark for a society . 
  finland itself had a bloody civil war only twenty years before the winter war , between royalist/capitalist `` whites '' and socialist/communist `` reds '' , where almost a 40 000 people died . 
  over 10 000 of those of hunger and disease in terrible conditions in prison camps . 
  the war left deep scars in the national psyche that lasted well into the 60s/70s and in some ways even further . 
  the only thing that probably saved finland from decades of white repression and possibly a very different future was germany losing wwi , and with that , the influence it had in finland . 
  the white side had to compromise and take the reds back into politics , which gave them a representation and furthered national unity . 
  despite that , small scale repression and attacks on leftists continued until the early 30s when far right activists took the former president k.j. 
  st\u00e5hlberg and his wife to one of their `` drives to the country '' , and began losing support . 
  there was even talk at the time of a possible military coup being planned by army officers who considered the current government too leftist for their tastes . 
  the reason the finns could unite to fight a war only less than a decade after that , is that we had a well defined , external enemy , and we agreed that we were all fighting for the self-determination of the country , despite what side we were on politically .

  edit : this guy puts it well in simplest possible terms in this video on bloomberg : [ pkverleger llc president phil verleger discusses the changing economics of oil with betty liu on `` bloomberg markets . '' ] ( http://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2015-12-11/iea-warns-of-worsening-oil-glut ) `` oil is the new corn . '', 
  as opec cartel lost its power to set prices the oil market has become a very competitive free market , like any other commodity , which keeps the prices low . 
  and if there is a swing producer on this new market it 's the numerous us frackers who can and will react swiftly to price changes . 
  for opec to get their cartel position back they would need to cut their production and at the same time others to cut their production even more . 
  for every barrel saudi arabia would cut others would need to cut three . 
  wo n't happen . 
  `` much of the oil will stay in the ground . '', 
  that concerns longer term . 
  it has become more and more obvious that with efforts to mitigate the global climate change much of the known oil will need to stay in the ground . 
  and on long term the old adage `` oil in the ground is worth more than money in the bank '' does not hold true any more . 
  to make money you 'll have to produce while you can even for smaller profits , which means more competition on the market . 
  `` there is no benchmark . '', 
  `` venezuela is the first to give up . '', 
  probably so , and if venezuela 's production falls the oil prices will spike up . 
  but that 's only short term because the us frackers will swiftly rise their production for better prices causing the prices to fall again , and we 're back to square one . 
  `` opec is irrelevant . '', 
  that 's a dramatic way to put it , but does ring true . 
  opec has lost their power - at least for the time being - and some very dramatic changes need to happen if they were to get their position back . 
   turkey thinks that everyone is shit , but the kurds are the shittest of all not really the kurds but for example pkk and its affiliates . 
  turkey does train and support kurdish kdp-aligned peshmerga forces which are fighting against isis .

   do you happen to know what is the annual growth rate of norway 's fund [ here as a graph in nok . 
  ] ( https://www.regjeringen.no/contentassets/c1fa9f108f864c4baa13fa35c767ddb8/market1_2015spu.jpg ) you can read about it on norwegian gov site [ here . 
  ] ( https://www.regjeringen.no/en/topics/the-economy/the-government-pension-fund/government-pension-fund-global-gpfg/market-value-and-capital-inflow/id696852/ ) growth comes from two main pillars : investments gaining value , and new capital flowing into the fund . 
  last two quartes the fund has filed losses mostly due to investments in china losing value but it still remains the largest in the world and the losses are not significant in long term : http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-10-28/norway-sovereign-wealth-fund-suffers-biggest-loss-in-four-years  the $ 860 billion fund lost 273 billion kroner ( $ 32 billion ) in the third quarter , or 4.9 percent , the oslo-based investor said on wednesday . 
  its stock holdings declined 8.6 percent , while it posted a 0.9 percent gain on bonds and a 3 percent return on real estate . 
  it was the first back-to-back quarterly loss in six years . 
   `` we have to expect fluctuations in the value of the fund when there are large movements in the market , '' said yngve slyngstad , its chief executive officer . 
  `` with the fund as big as it is today , this can have a considerable impact in the short term . 
  the fund has a long-term horizon , however , and is in a good position to ride out short-term volatility . '' new capital is still flowing into the fund and the net flow is positive although it has slowed down due to low oil prices : [ graph ] ( http://i.imgur.com/xnlibnz.png )  and what was it for russia 's before sanctions ? 
  [ graph of russia 's foreign exchange reserve 2013 to present . 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/scapskt.png ) the reserve has lost roughly $ 150 bn and has shrunk from over $ 500 bn to current $ 365 bn . 
  remember that russia 's fx reserve consists of multiple components such as cash , gold and the reserve fund . 
  last year and earlier this year russia 's central bank burned through a lot of cash when defending the falling ruble . 
  also the russian gov has had to draw funds to finance the gov budget deficit due to low oil prices and sanctions stopping international financing . 
  the reserve fund is shrinking rapidly , has fallen to about $ 66bn , and could be gone next year : [ russia : key reserve fund to run dry by end of next year ] ( http://bigstory.ap.org/article/ef9af6dc1ffc42be8b352864dc2a45e8/russia-1-2-reserve-funds-run-dry-end-next-year ) as you can see the situation in russia is very different from norway . 
   russia does n't actually violate airspace , yes it does . 
  sometimes they have been even using military aircrafts pretending to be civilian traffic while violating the sovereign airspace of its neighbours . 
  and they have been willfully putting actual civilian traffic at risk by flying into busy airways with transponders off . 
   putin strengthened the state 's control over its assets to stop the ludicrous amount of robbery done via the privatization schemes us specialists suggested in the 90s . 
  good story bro . 
  while privatization was recommended by the relevant international institutions the hairbrained scheme how to do it was planned , decided , and implemented by russia - by russian experts and by russian politicians . 
  that was done against the recommendations , and russia was advised that their idea of how to do privatization was pretty much the worst . 
  and the results were pretty much just as disastrous as was expected . 
  the only one to blame for the idiotic manner the privatizations were done is russia . 
  yet russia would n't be russia if it did n't blame everyone else for their own failures . 
  norway has [ the world 's largest sovereign wealth fund worth about $ 855 billion ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sovereign_wealth_fund#largest_sovereign_wealth_funds ) . 
  russia has nothing comparable to norway 's sovereign wealth fund . 
  what russia has is about $ 365 bn of foreign exchange reserves with most of it illiquid , already earmarked for different purposes , or tied up in wealth funds such as the reserve fund ( ~ $ 66bn ) and the national wealth fund ( ~ $ 74bn ) . 
  meanwhile the price of oil is falling to new lows , brent currently at 40.12 and falling : [ graph ] ( http://i.imgur.com/6adjojf.jpg ) and also ruble is falling , it 's already close to 70 rub/usd : http://www.xe.com/currencycharts/?from=usd&amp;to=rub&amp;view=1d, 
  the name sibelius comes from house called sibbe/sibbes in lapinj\u00e4rvi , finland . 
  that 's the house where juho '' sibbe '' matinpoika ( 1759-1820 ) lived . 
  his son johan `` sibbe '' juhonpoika ( 1785-1844 ) moved to loviisa , and later on adopted the name sibelius . 
  johan sibelius was the grandfather of jean sibelius . 
  here 's the genealogy of his family back to 16th century : http://www.sibelius.fi/suomi/suku_perhe/suku_sibelius.htm, 
  a typical low-effort comment by a three day old account . 
   is not wide to say that someone speaking russian is russian i think it is . 
  my friend speaks russian and she 's certainly not russian . 
  i speak english and i 'm certainly not english nor british . 
  and while i also speak swedish i 'm not swedish either . 
  to claim that speaking a language means you are also of that ethnicity is foolish . 
  what is `` russian '' anyway ? 
  when the russian gov claims to protect russian minorities outside its borders it seems that merely speaking russian means you 're russian , which is ridiculously wide definition . 
  but when russian citizens join terrorist organisation the definition of `` russian '' seems to suddenly become exceedingly narrow . 
   so basically common knowledge from the year 2010 . 
  certainly the actual numbers have changed since then , and those numbers likely vastly underestimate the actual numbers . 
  for example , in finland the number has probably doubled since 2010 . 
  facts are not a matter of world view but reality . 
  he probably refers to the fact that this year alone finland has received over 30000 asylym applicants , the vast majority of them being from iraq , somalia and afganistan which are predominantly muslim countries ( only about 500-600 from syria ) . 
  their presented number of 40000 muslims in finland underestimates the actual numbers . 
  and it 's actually their estimate from 2010 . 
  muslim population in finland has probably doubled since then . 
  the article says :  energy-hungry turkey relies on russia for 55 percent of its natural gas and 30 percent of its oil . 
  that 30 % does n't sound correct . 
  according to eia and the international energy agency ( iea ) oil from russia was 3 % in 2014 : [ fig . 
  turkey crude oil supply mix 2014 ] ( http://www.eia.gov/beta/international/analysis_includes/countries_long/turkey/images/crude_oil_supply_mix.png )  in 2014 , most of turkey 's crude oil imports came from iraq and iran ( figure 3 ) ,5 with each supplying slightly more than a quarter of the country 's crude oil . 
  the share of crude oil from russia , once the largest source country of turkey 's crude oil , has fallen as russian crude oil is increasingly being directed toward asian markets . 
  there already is one from 1989 : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_winter_war_%28film%29#tv_series * it tells the story of a finnish infantry regiment `` jr 23 '' , which consists almost solely of men from southern ostrobothnia , focusing mainly on a platoon of reservists from kauhava . 
   russia has always had a more organic stake in the levant . 
  we have known since 2003 that [ putin is dobby . 
  ] ( http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ymcwbfu4dxs/vlgsucd1lci/aaaaaaaajcm/guhww_91l5a/s1600/putin-and-dobby.jpg ) in 2003 , after the film * harry potter and the chamber of secrets * had premiered , russian lawyers were busy preparing a lawsuit : [ russian lawyers say harry potter character dobby is based on putin ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/film/2003/jan/30/harrypotter.news ) findlaw 's opinion on the matter : [ does putin have a case against the ` harry potter ' house elf ?

   well , he 'd be hard pressed to shoot it to europe from there . 
  how so ? 
  width of the bosphorus strait : 0.7-3 .4 km igla 's operational range : 5.2 km seems within range to me . 
  it 's a joke . 
  and a good one imo . 
  sometimes his jokes just go whoosh in r/europe . 
   i 'm saying absolutely nothing about the bcg report - only about the forbes article that draws certain conclusions from the report . 
  sounds like you 're claiming that forbes is misrepresenting the bcg report , but at the same time you do n't want to say anything about the bcg report . 
  what exactly is wrong in those `` certain conclusions '' of forbes and how are they not supported by the bcg report ? 
   according to them people of taiwan are twice as rich as russians are , and that sounds reasonable . 
  taiwan is an advanced economy producing high-added-value goods and having highly developed finacial sector , and i 'm quite sure that average taiwanese are wealthier than russians . 
  [ the credit suisse report ] ( https://publications.credit-suisse.com/tasks/render/file/?fileid=bcdb1364-a105-0560-1332ec9100ff5c83 ) says :  taiwan is a prime example of a successful asian tiger economy . 
  its average wealth is usd 151,800 , well above the level of even the most successful developing and transition countries , and close to some countries in western europe . 
  wealth rose from usd 107,000 in the year 2000 to usd 167,900 in 2010 , with no decline during the global financial crisis of 2007-09 . 
  currency depreciation caused a 12 % drop in wealth in usd in 2011 , but wealth stayed level in domestic currency terms and has since edged upwards again . 
  over the entire period 2000-13 , wealth per adult grew by 2.7 % per annum using current usd and by 4.3 % per year using constant exchange rates . 
  sounds correct to me .

  the film was spoken in english ( a huge concession ! ) . 
  it 's set in new york ( because nothing ever happens in eu ) . 
  that was the best we can probably ever manage , and that film was still only a flash in a pan . 
  we speak strange languages . 
  nobody outside eu is going to be interested in watching films that were originally finnish , swedish , german or french ( or what have you ) . 
  if a local film does great in europe , hollywood makes a new version where the plot is moved to usa . 
  it will never be given a place in theatres on its own . 
   all the while the us produces masses of cultur , many very bad and some very good . 
  in europe , we then produce copies of what the us invented culturally ( web sites , tv shows , movies , etc. ), 
  but lets not talk about that . 
  lets talk about the fact that people need to be able to value their own cultures . 
  if all the films , tv-shows etc. 
  are based in new york , people will start to think new york as the standard . 
  people will take cues on how to behave from those shows , as they lack better sources . 
  seeing second-gen immigrant somalis acting like afro-americans because that 's the only role models they get is really depressing , to give a fairly easy example . 
  we need local tv-shows that showcase local problems and show that stuff happens near us . 
  shows that tell us about how we we deal with immigration ( which means somalis among the cast and shown as part of the society ) , about our own local problems caused from living where we do ( like what happens when your wife decides you need a digital tv adapter right now and the closest store is hundreds of kilometres away over frozen ground ? 
  * ) , historical films about our history , not about killing indians or conquering the west . 
  and so on . 
  this stuff is important . 
  while tv should not be used in lieu of school , it can be used to complement . 
  to tell about our society , our ideals , our problems . 
  easy example to illustrate ; when you show boobs in non-sexual context eu-films , you are telling ; `` this is n't a big thing '' . 
  if kids only see american films , they think boobs are a big thing , a sexual thing , and thus the next generation will act accordingly . 
  sure , the stuff is partly copying , because there are only so many ways you can do the big story lines , only so many things that work on screen . 
  but devil is in the details , as the saying goes . 
  think , perhaps , stargate and doctor who ; both are pretty similar shows , but for the fact that the first mentioned is more about military superiority when the latter is about using your brain and abhorring guns . 
  and this detail makes all the difference . 
   the only modern cultural good we seem to be good in are video games . 
  we make great films , tv , books , art etc. 
  the problem is that it does n't get translated to anglo-saxon world , and thus we do n't notice it 's relevancy . 
  this is an example of our cultural inferiority complex . 
  our video games -- how european are they , really ? 
  i do n't really like that many games ( my taste is rather narrow ) , but are n't they english and often set in america ? 
  we are n't even the heroes in our own stories !, 
  the only exemption i can think of is the assassin 's creed-series . 
  do we really want a situation where cheap us produced garage wars-type programs take even bigger slice of television programming ? 
  or all the films at theatres are either hollywood made or at least inspired ? 
  it 's important that local and eu-made programming will be done and shown in the future . 
  otherwise us values and cultures will become the norm and our own as the marginalia from which young people want out of . 
  lobbying is simply about telling your view to the politician . . preferably repeatedly and in several ways . 
  there 's nothing sinister about it -- the fact is that a politician is not a master of all walks of life and would otherwise do stupid decisions out of ignorance . 
  yes , they get briefed by people from bureau ( see : * yes , minister * ) , but they might also have agendas or ignore certain viewpoints for convenience . 
  so , for example , some librarian might lobby the city council for a bigger budget by explaining the importance of library to the community ( which the alderman might not bring readily up , only telling how much closing library would ease the money problems ) . 
  the idea is that all parties will have their say and then the politician can decide without unknowingly trampling any rights . 
  this is the basic level . 
  then when stuff is far from where you actually live , you ca n't actually go to talk to the politician yourself ( like you can on city council level , as the politicians are farther from you and they have more votes to think of - be it national politicians in stockholm or bryssels ) , and instead you start writing letters ( thats lobbying too ! ), 
  or you form an association who hires a lobbyist ( which is what eff is in usa and edri is in eu ) . 
  still pretty above ground . 
  some companies hire lobbyists as well , as they have interests as well . 
  as long as all parties get their time , things are well . 
  it starts to stink of corruption when the lobbyist pays for the politician either to listen to him ( like treating him to an expensive dinner while explaining his point of view ) or offering cash-backs ( or other favours , such as a job after the term ends ) in favour of the right vote . 
  another problem is that the politician might not think citizen-organisation lobbyists may not be sen as legitimate when corporate interests ' lobbyist is seen as one ( for example , the politician accepts shell 's lobbyist but not greenpeace 's ) . 
  but if the lobbyists deal fairly , the politician understands she must be evenhanded etc. , then the arrangement is a great way to keep the politician in his glass tower connected to the people at the ground level . 
  disclosure ; i 'm a member of several citizen associations that lobbies the national government for better legislation and/or money for certain projects . 
  i 've also held some very low-level county-positions after getting the minimum number of votes from town population ( we 're talking about tens of votes ) . 
  mostly the `` lobbying '' talks were similar to what you can imagine talking to jehova 's wittnesses is like . 
  i imagine the people get a lot more professional when you have more power than just one in eight votes on should a parking hall be shut down as dangerously poorly kept . 
  plus swedish ( and nordic population in general ) is concentrated on the towns and cities , as building infrastructure ( schools , hospitals , supplying stores etc. ), 
  is rather expensive for just few people . 
   i genuinely believe putin won the elections fair and square . 
  the ballot box stuffing was so blatant that even putin acknowledged it and installed web cameras to observe the boxes . 
  they were still stuffed , even when the feed was broadcast to to web . 
  [ link ] ( http://observers.france24.com/content/20111206-russia-election-fraud-caught-video-ballot-stuffing-erasable-ink-putin-protests ) not to mention that you can obviously see the manipulation in the results data released by the russian federation . 
  [ link ] ( http://www.angrybureaucrat.com/2011/12/statistical-analyses-say-recent-russian.html ), 
  i wish i could be optimistic , but we have bent so much even on points where we are clearly on top , like swift . 
  all the important servers are in eu , yet the banking details are still given to usa . 
  the same goes with ( before linked ) cloud services , european tourist visits to usa . 
  in the latter point i would be satisfied if the information turnover would even be equal , but eu very clearly acts like a client state . 
  i do n't think this time will be any different . 
  and a lot of native english speakers , street signs one can read , newspapers etc. 
  ( not that snowden has a lot of time to play tourist . ), 
  mission accomplished !, 
  pity there was n't air carrier available . 
  ok , that 's better . 
  what sort of changes would you do then ? 
  using the american confederations ( in both north and south america in 18th century ) and german confederation as warning reflections against present eu ? 
  the point is that we are n't living in ancient greece , with no previous knowledge of what works and what does n't . 
  we live in 21st century with thousands of years of knowledge on human behaviour in general and on confederations in particular . 
  and confederations have very bad track records . 
  now , it might well be that the problem is n't in the idea , but in the execution . 
  after all , all republics before usa were pretty much fucked as well and they were n't seen as a stable model either . 
  but here we are , in the 21st century , and republics are everywhere . 
  but washington et al did n't go with the idea of republic half-assed . 
  they realised that these things tend to be unstable and easily turn into monarchies . 
  and they took steps to ensure this does n't happen . 
  what you 're saying is that just because the rock did n't float the past 30 times , it might float the next time . 
  you know , one definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting different answers  if you would bother to think ways to make confederation as a model , i 'd listen you . 
  but , as i said , you did n't and going with euro without proper planning has already almost done us in . 
  you are confusing too things . 
  turkeys ( i suppose you mean the animal , not the nation ) do n't understand humans , have no concept of human culture or history . 
  but we understand humans and our history . 
  and expections happen , but they do n't happen without reason . 
  the only exemption i can think is switzerland , and they are quite small unit . 
  i do like confederation model myself , but liking is n't enough . 
  you also have to create a system to make it work . 
  otherwise it 's just euro-mess again . 
  you are intentionally forgetting income levels . 
  everything pays and costs more in north , so the debt follows the rules . 
  i 'd be happier without the debt , but there it is .

  go fucking read the 1951 un convention on refugees . 
  you need a reason to have your asylum request accepted and thus receive the status of refugee . 
  `` theres a war going on in a part of my country '' isnt a valid reason . 
  you need to have concrete proof that you are under the risk of death , torture or other persecution in order to be granted asylum . 
  also why do you think most of the asylum seekers we got were iraqis . 
  why do you think they skipped sweden as soon as they heard that the finnish policies on iraqi , somalian and afghan asylum seekers are outdated and less strict than in sweden ? 
  we got the shit from the bottom of the barrel , thats why only half of the asylum seekers that came here were granted asylum . 
  the rest will have to be deported even though their countries dont want them back  94 % of syrians are granted asylum . 
  well no shit , syrians are legit refugees unlike some guys from baghdad or south iraq . 
  only 2 % of the refugees that came here were syrians btw  you 're literally making up numbers like ' a majority are n't refugees ' and ` at least half get their asylum request rejected ' . 
  this is n't an oversimplification , it 's objective fact . 
  you do realize that theres also a huge amount of asylum seekers that lie about their identity and claim to be syrians , hoping that the lies are believed and they get almost certain asylum ? 
  im only talking about finland , sure its possible that on the grand scheme of things the number of genuine refugees could be higher than here . 
  propably is . 
  but theres still a very significant amount of people coming in as economical refugees and making shit up about being in a risk of death . 
  youd do that too if you lived in a shit country like iraq and had enough money to pay human trafficers to take you to europe . 
  you really dont see the difference beetween finland and crimea ? 
  crimea is geopolitically very important to russia . 
  for ukraine , its not worth anything really . 
  thats why kiev didnt use to really give a shit about crimea or its population which led to them remaining overwhelmingly pro-russian , much more so than the population of donetsk or luhansk . 
  russia annexed crimea the moment yanukovich was ousted , because the new government/rulers likely wouldnt agree on russia having the naval base there . 
  this naval base is the home of the black sea fleet so its extremely important . 
  what do you think that for example the us would do if there was a anti-us coup going on in say , germany and it threatened nato airbases in the country . 
  any super finland on the other hand - not really that important . 
  if russia got into armed conflict/aggression against us it wouldnt be an annexation , that would cost too much . 
  it would be attrition warfare and setting up extremist groups to use as insurgent pawns to try and pressure finland into accomodating to whatever interests russia had . 
  after you downvote me , try to calm your butt , think with your brain and see the situation objectively . 
   three sam divisions tracked him for some time , but failed to obtain permission to launch at him . 
  all air defenses were brought to readiness and two interceptors were sent to investigate . 
   bet you 'd have a riot yeah what a great idea it would be to destabilize russia , right ? 
  do a reality check, 
  russians were already the majority in 1920 's, 
   trying to scapegoat it as ` nasty immigrants coming for my benefits ' is just dismissing the actual problem and is honestly kinda disgusting im not scapegoating it , learn to digest what you read . 
  yes i dont like people who come here and request asylum and try to pass off as legit refugees just because they think they found an easy way to move to europe . 
  im not saying theres no actual refugees in the migrant flow . 
  there is , alot of them and they deserve to be granted asylum . 
  but the others need to be thrown the fuck out with their bs stories , `` lost ids '' and lies about their age  like , people would want to leave their homes and families just so that they can get an iphone ? 
  yes they would . 
  if you lived in iraq or something youd likely consider going to europe aswell and making up a story about your life being in danger . 
  and then request family reunification if you get refugee status . 
  tell me , why didnt we get syrian refugees here in finland ? 
  we mostly got iraqis , afghans and somalis who actually travelled through sweden to get here ? 
  at least half of them get their asylum request rejected and deported . 
  do you know why ? 
  because they werent eligible for it , they were economical migrants fleeing the shitty conditions of their country and not actual war or persecution . 
  and they knew it was easier to get asylum here in finland than in sweden . 
   it does when ` being shitty ' = ` trying to kill you ' . 
  youre oversimplifying the situation . 
  there was many other reasons for it . 
  ahmadinejad was very incompetent , sanctions or not . 
  so youre just gon na fly an armed drone over moscow ? 
  good luck, 
  are you saying that all of the asylum seekers and illegal immigrants that come to europe are refugees ? 
  they are all fleeing war and repression ? 
  i think that the situation began when people who live in countries where their lives are very difficult realized that they can just pay some money to a trafficer and go to europe illegally and get away with it and be provided for if they just request asylum . 
  sure , theres alot of genuine refugees but id say the majority of the people who migrated to europe during this recent crisis were economical migrants , fake refugees who are fleeing the fact that their country is shit and doesnt work , not war . 
  your country being shitty doesnt make you eligible for asylum . 
   end the occupation of crimea . 
  crimea is pretty much rightful russian territory . 
  it has russian population that have been overwhelmingly pro-russian for ages now , not just recently . 
  and also it has an important naval base . 
  i think what russia is doing in donbass is stupid bullshit and they do it only to bleed ukraine . 
  but crimea belongs to russia . 
  btw sanctions wont make russians `` vote out '' putin . 
  thats pretty naive . 
  sanctions have literally never made people turn against a leader that knows how to play people . 
  as i said it would * discourage * the economical migrants . 
  if you put them in camps to wait for their application to be reviewed a ` la australia , fewer of them will want to embark on the journey . 
  the camps dont necessarily even have to be on an island . 
  hungary shows that even the idea of having to wait in a camp for months discourages alot of the migrants but still gives the genuine refugees a chance for asylum . 
   for instance , le pen at some point offered to throw all muslims out of france , be them foreigners or french citizens . 
  ok thats a fair point , i dislike that bullshit too  btw , france has a civil and human rights history that would n't allow any camp solution like in hungary . 
  how is it against human rights to keep illegal migrants in camps until they have their asylum applications reviewed and resolved ? 
  put independent observers in the camps to make sure the conditions are humane . 
  as i said , this will discourage the economical migrants posing as refugees which will greatly lessen the burden , thus making human trafficing less profitable/widespread and itll make the conditions better for the legit refugees aswell because people wont instantly assume they are all economical migrants . 
  i agree that the whole anti-muslim and racist sentiments are fucking stupid and distract people from the real issues . 
  theres actors such as politicians , ngos etc. 
  who have personal interest in keeping the flow of asylum seekers uncontrollable . 
  for example here in finland theres politicians , mps , who actually run companies ( or their fiance or relative or a friend runs the company ) that make money by accomodating asylum seekers . 
  but because there was such a `` hurry '' when the flow of asylum seekers was uncontrollable , no one cared if the contracts etc. 
  for these companies had shady shit on them . 
  thats how you get things like one asylum seeker costing 250 $ / day . 
  there was attorney companies that would offer `` legal counseling '' to the asylum seekers . 
  most of these counseling meetings never happened yet the people who ran the asylum center put their name on the paper so they would get money for the state to fund this legal counseling that never happened . 
  so my point is , corrupt politicians are the problem . 
  they want to uphold status quo so they can keep doing whatever shady shit they are doing , whether its pocketing money from the state or something else . 
  in south europe you also have the mafias running ngos that make an agreement with the human trafficers to pick up a load of migrants when they are about halfway across the mediterranean to make the trafficing faster . 
  theres no doubt that these criminals would bribe or pressure officials and politicians into supporting lenient policies on asylum seekers . 
  though mainly the reason the refugee crisis was handled in a very ineffective and slow manner was the blind ideological sentiments and the idea that european countries could just keep letting people illegally immigrate and get away with it by asking asylum . 
  all the shady shit i mentioned is just another detrimental side effect of this situation, 
  legal immigrants = / = illegal migrant `` refugees '' . 
  im pretty sure most of the asylum seekers didnt come to france via a plane . 
  you dont need a wall . 
  you just need to discourage people from illegally entering your country and seeking asylum just because they know if they ask for asylum , they get to stay even if not documented . 
  hungary has a pretty sensible police regarding this . 
  arrest them , put them in camps till they have their applications processed . 
  this will discourage the economical migrants/fake refugees while still allowing the legit refugees to get asylum from your country . 
   obviously . 
  because the opposition does n't have planes . 
  so they ca n't throw barrel bombs at you .

  i just read the wikipedia article on right to roam and it seems rather limited :  the new rights were introduced region by region through england and wales , with completion in 2005 . 
  maps showing accessible areas have been produced . 
  really , maps ?!, 
  for comparison : i 've only seen barbed wire in finland in the immediate vicinity to cows . 
  and it 's ok to go wherever as long as it is n't somebody backyard ( eg . 
  somebody is moving the lawn regularly ) . 
  anyway , this was just an example . 
  this was years ago for me , so i 've forgotten a lot . 
  but it all felt rather strict . 
  like playing one of those old computer games before sandboxes became a thing . 
   which is considered to be in eurasia so is japan . 
  i realise that . 
  i was talking about the mentality behind these rules that still exists . 
  you ca n't even go hiking in the countryside because everything is covered with barbed wire . 
   i do enjoy that placing a postage stamp upside down on an envelope is high treason , because it has a portrait of the queen on it . 
  other fun ones : it 's laws , rules etc. 
  like this that made me dislike living in uk . 
  it seemed that you were more concerned with rules than with solutions and the general happiness of the citizens . 
  but then , all those countries have high population density . 
  i 've travelled extensively in finland and sweden and the roads are n't that good here either when you get to the roads that just support local people . 
  pretty much . 
  also that because their politicals are all millionaires , they do n't really have much sympathy for union-organisers . 
  in europe , left-wingers have made it illegal to disturb union organisers -- in some countries ( such as finland ) there are laws that demand that employers help organising unions . 
  in usa , the laws pretty much make clear that hiring people to beat organisers is illegal only if tv-cameras are present . 
  pretty average . 
  would n't really jump out from a crowd . 
  you think it 's better that highest person in the realm is a man , if gay , rather than a woman ? 
  you 're a real class act !, 
  ( i know this was n't what you were thinking , but it 's a real concern . ), 
  edit : and i have no idea why you were downvoted . . or why i was , for that case . 
  i was just going for an observation . 
  that and * kamel\u00e5s\u00e5 * ? 
  the important word here is `` relative '' . 
  as in `` relative poverty '' , 50 % of median income . 
  ( which is really low-balling , the official standard is 60 % , iirc . ), 
   how is it chosen which union does negotiate , or does everyone for themselfs ? 
  all unions are members of bigger unions who in turn are part of bigger unions . 
  ultimately there are three confederated central unions that represent wage-workers , salaried employees and academic professionals . 
  each of these sends their own representative to the meeting . 
  on the other side of the table there are representatives of similar industrial/employer-confederations . 
   usually the employers side is dominated by the conservative near organisations and the employees side by the social democratic near ones . 
  the unions are very close to social democratic party which they tend to fund ( with a small amount of money going to socialist party ) . 
  and the employers send money to the bourgeois-parties . 
  i would n't laugh . 
  if a company hires people in romania for 1 $ / hour and sends them to sweden , those contracts are legal and binding , says ecj . 
   it completely ignores the cost of basic provisions ; enough food to prevent malnutrition , water , electricity , shelter , sanitation , education , healthcare , clothing , etc. 
  most of the countries on the list have separate allowances for rent etc. 
  so the static tells how much you have to work on top of the safety net to get out of poverty . 
  students are usually in the worst position in developed countries . 
  in finland if you 're unemployed you will probably get about 1000 $ / month from the government as this is seen as the lowest amount on which one can survive , but if you 're a student you get at most 450 $ +300 $ loan . 
   but if i 'm an employer for a very vague job , what 's to stop me finding people who are n't part of a union ? 
  [ you might be interested of this post i just wrote ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/35bqw3/weekly_hours_at_minimum_wage_to_move_out_of/cr3g5q4 ) . 
  sweden is encountering problems because of ecj-decision that you ca n't enforce union salaries for foreign companies that send employees to sweden . 
  our professor ( who had done research on the area ) claimed that they were going to solve this by transitioning closer to finnish model ( which is fine for ecj ) . 
   if i do n't need skilled employees , what makes me negotiate with a union ? 
  not understanding british system that well , i 'm guessing you have different union structure . 
  while we have small unions , they are part of bigger unions and they in turn ultimately represented by confederal central unions that represents pretty much everybody . 
  we have three unions : working class unions those who are paid wages , one for salaried employees and one for academic professionals . 
  together , these three unions cover all employees in finland . 
  so you can always escalate until you can grind the whole country to a standstill . 
   it 's strange that not a single scandinavian country is depicted on this chart since i would expect them to rank quite low . 
  this was just handled at school this week . 
  nordic countries are n't on these lists because we do n't use minimum wage system . 
  instead the unions negotiate minimum wages with companies * . 
  the companies that do n't negotiate or where unions do n't have enough power are then put on strike until they bend . 
  as such , in finland the minimum wage for waiter is 9,97 $ / h but cleaners and green area workers have minimum wage closer to 7 $ / h. 
  apparently this is a better system ( according to cross-eu research ) than singular minimum wage as it takes better into account the productivity on different fields . 
  however , it presupposes strong union-strength . 
  when such strength does n't exist , the state has to introduce semi-optimal system instead . 
  personally ( even knowing the history ) i find it very curious that something like this does n't exist in usa , seeing as how you dislike strong government controls in general . 
  * in finland , the unions negotiate with whole industries and the conclusion is then made into lawful minimum wage table , even for companies that are n't part of the employee/employer unions . 
   `` founding fathers '' ( \u3063 \u0ca5_\u0ca5 ), 
  slightly positive feelings for eu in general here ( positive for free movement and the peace-process , negative due to things relating optimal market areas and structures that direct finland toward more liberal welfare regime ) . 
  * te deum * and * ode to joy * always leave me speechless . 
  i also think the flag is really neat symbol and i feel it connects us ( here at the edge of civilization ) to the larger context of european history . 
  otherwise i feel rather phlegmatic over the subject . 
  and here 's the kicker : all the symbols i listed were only later adapted by eu : they 're originally council of europe-symbols ( or ebu ) and could be used free of eu : but i do n't think almost anybody does . 
  you note that the previous speaker did differentiate between musical and political sensibilities . 
  do n't be a dick . 
  worked for trapped in reddit . 
  is n't finns a centric party , though ? 
  just to repeat from another thread : the official name of the party is * the finns * and a direct translation would be * common finns * or * average finns * . 
  their ideology is very much defined by nimbyism , not by far-right . 
  they were originally populist splitters from centrist agrarian party and have n't gotten too far from their roots . 
  i find it surprising that the artist bothered to draw the lower panels again instead of copypasting . 
  [ they can into nordic the same way as finland did . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nordic_model ), 
  as i said , there 's overlap . 
  terrorists might go after military targets , too . 
  and the distinction is n't always very clear ( those collaborators were n't military , for example ) . 
  best translation would probably be `` common finns '' . 
  the idea being that they 're not elite . 
  edit : everyday finns is even better . 
  the problem is that many spots like railways are both . 
  but i hopefully did n't claim that the two terms are the same : i meant that there 's overlap . 
  and you had the rightful heir the next 800 years ? 
   no , you really ca n't . 
  did belgium or portugal oppress other countries in europe nope . 
  i did say `` pretty much about any bigger nation '' , not `` every nation '' . 
   would go as far as to say the uk did n't really either in ireland , the famine was just a result of horrible neglect .

  there 's always something to learn from history : a laskiaispulla wo n't kill you , but 14 in a row just might . 
  and , although they are yet to have own independend country , we should n't forget our cousins the [ mari people ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mari_people ) , who only in the 16th century adopted christianity but have to this day upheld their traditional beliefs and still widely practice them . 
  * `` christianity was adopted by the mari in the 16th century after their territory was incorporated into the russian empire during the reign of ivan iv `` the terrible '' . 
  adoption of christianity was not universal , however , and many mari today still practice paganism in syncretic forms , or purer forms adhering to organized neopagan mari traditional religion organizations . 
  pagans constitute a significant minority of 25 to 40 % of the mari . 
   ( but i suppose it still does n't rule out they may have been influenced by someone finnish ) the horror . 
  the horror . 
  influence of someone finnish . 
  :p seriously , it 's just a webcomic making jokes , and open to critisism as such , but it 's not historiography . 
   nevertheless , the narrative does feel odd to me , and it does fit with the recent nationalistic tendencies of the true finns . 
  leaving true finns party aside , how * is * our long common history taught in school in sweden ? 
   i guess it stems from the fact that we learn very little about the swedish era in comprehensive school . 
  are you sure ? 
  because back in my school days in the '80s it was extensively covered from kings and military to impact to art and society . 
  which is no wonder as those over 600 years covers the most of finland 's written history , and is indeed an important part of it . 
  has something changed there ? 
   i remember learning something about gustav vasa and some stuff like that in elementary school but never really thought it was interesting anyway . 
  then perhaps , and i hope , our different experiences are a matter of perceptions , as i was always very interested in history , and was also lucky to have good teachers . 
  nah , but it 's only a comic with jokes . 
  not to be taken as historiography or too seriously . 
  anyway , through a link there i learned about funny personifications of finland and sweden and other countries in japanese manga and anime : [ strike witches ] ( http://strikewitches.wikia.com/wiki/suomus ) - apparently those female characters are based on finnish wwii aces such as [ ilmari juutilainen ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ilmari_juutilainen ) . 
  and in [ hetalia ] ( http://hetalia.wikia.com/wiki/sweden/finland ) the complex relationship between sweden and finland is all too funny !, 
  and now take a good look at a 2 $ coin . 
  can not unsee . 
   i would n't be surprised if the author of this comic is a true finn supporter . 
  as the author of the comic is [ an american ] ( http://warmfuzzyglow.com/my-new-project-a-webcomic-about-finland-10257/ ) , i 'd be surprised if he has ever even heard of true finns party , or has a chip on his shoulder . 
   as a swede , i wonder where all all this resentment is coming from . 
  recently maybe just our language dispute overspilling . 
  there is an opposition to the compulsory swedish at schools . 
  and some leave no stone unturned to dig some dirt to fling aroud whether it 's relevant to the compulsory swedish or not . 
  now , i do n't know how it gets reported in sweden , but perhaps there 's a tendency to sensationalize at least in the headlines i 've seen . 
   the truth is that finland was never treated as a colony of sweden . 
  it was a part of sweden , and treated just like any other province of the realm , quite unlike the narrative in this comic . 
  during our 600 years together we had our ups and downs . 
  personally i respect , and love our long common history , but also recognize that it is open to different narratives some closer to ` truth ' than others . 
  all in all , i see that the long period as a part of sweden had a positive impact on finland and it 's future . 
  and some of the swedish kings are fondly remembered in finland . 
  then again . 
  russia easily conquers finland . 
  achievement unlocked : instant autonomy !, 
   anyway , here 's to our common history and glory days !, 
  sure we are . 
  but the comic is authored by [ an american ] ( http://warmfuzzyglow.com/my-new-project-a-webcomic-about-finland-10257/ ) . 
  esa has not excluded russia , as russia has n't been seeking for a membership or an associate membership like canada has . 
  during last two decades the relations between esa and russia 's roscosmos have deepened into significant partnership and cooperation in many areas such as : human spaceflight , launchers , science , earth observation , navigation etc. 
  esa and roscosmos have an partnership agreement ( `` cooperation and partnership in the exploration and use of outer space for peaceful purposes '' ) and roscosmos participates in many projects . 
  more : http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/policies/space/esp/international-cooperation/russia/index_en.htm esa also has different cooperation agreements with argentina , brazil , china , india and japan . 
  edit : here 's a most recent example : [ jaxa and esa sign amendment to the agreement concerning cooperation in the field of space parts ] ( http://www.jaxa.jp/collabo/int/index_e.html ) ` let 's desing and test our parts in a way that we can * both * use same parts ' is a very good idea to avoid reinventing the wheel and overlapping manufacturing . 
  and it works already . 
  i get your point , but as esa has no rule to exclude non-european countries , i just wanted to add two often neglected countries . 
  israel already has [ a cooperation agreement with esa ] ( http://www.esa.int/about_us/welcome_to_esa/israel_signs_cooperation_agreement ) , and aspires closer relationship ( perhaps even eventual associate membership ? ) . 
  canada has been an associate member of esa since 1980 and has contributed significantly to projects . 
  canada will also have a role in the exomars project : http://www.urthecast.com/blog/updates/roscosmos-esa-collaborate-to-jumpstart-exomars/ so strictly speaking the headline is not correct as esa is not neccessarily the same as europe . 
  here 's a map of countries with different stages of membership : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:european_space_agency_enlargement_including_associates.png ( also australia used to be an associate member , but sadly not any more . ), 
  yes , at least in my country ( finland ) . 
  but it obviously depends on issue being reported . 
  if it relates to the federal government it is reported as such ( i.e. 
  us says this and that , us congress votes on something etc ) . 
  if the issue concerns a state or a city then it 's more specific ( i.e. 
  wildfires in colorado , tornado in oklahoma city , detroit probably defaulting etc ) . 
  i 'd think it 's pretty much same way in the us . 
  sounds like a nice event !, 
  reminds me of the [ tall ships ' races ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_tall_ships%27_races ) which are held in european waters every year , but the waters get rotated , so every four years it 's for example in the baltic . 
  you could start here : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_parliament#elections and here : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/elections_in_the_european_union those have links to further resources . 
  animation europe has a list of over 400 animated feature films from 1926 onwards : http://www.animationeurope.com/filmlist.asp and in imdb someone has made list of almost 300 films : http://www.imdb.com/list/-93epwtlwpo/ they include both adult and children 's films . 
  here 's some animated feature films i 've liked . 
  they 're not all cartoons , some use stop motion or mixed technique . 
  some of them are for kids too : [ the illusionist ( 2010 ) ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_illusionist_ ( 2010_film \\ ) ) [ persepolis ( 2007 ) ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/persepolis_ ( film \\ ) ) [ the triplets of belleville ( 2003 ) ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_triplets_of_belleville ) [ otes\u00e1nek ( 2000 ) ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0228687/ ) [ kirikou and the sorceress ( 1998 ) ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kirikou_and_the_sorceress ) [ krysar ( 1986 ) ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0174834/ ) [ when the wind blows ( 1986 ) ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/when_the_wind_blows_ ( film \\ ) ) [ time masters ( 1982 ) ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0084315/ ) [ allegro non troppo ( 1976 ) ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0074121/ ) [ la plan\u00e8te sauvage ( 1973 ) ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0070544/ ) [ yellow submarine ( 1968 ) ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0063823/ ) [ animal farm ( 1954 ) ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0047834/ ) edit : oh , and not to forget the obligatory cat : [ pettson & findus ] ( http://www.imdb.com/find?q=pettson+%26+findus&amp;amp;s=all ) ( 1999-2009 ), 
  but still lacks the heavy-metal . 
  that part needs some further progress as we currently do n't have any metal bands for infants . 
  so far just toddlers and kids are covered : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6shd7jrhcm, 
   the united states defines infant mortality more broadly than europe , and therefore overreports infant mortality when compared with many nations in europe . 
  as finland and us have similar definitions it is not a factor when comparing the reported numbers . 
  in * some * european countries there are some differences in definitions ( eg . 
  czech republic , france , ireland ) , but in finland they 're similar to the us . 
   yeah , sorry about ww2 old chap , circumstances demanded the greater good an ' all that . 
   we know . 
  no hard feelings at all . 
  that was the realpolitics of the day . 
   still , you 're in the eu now and we 've got nukes , ai n't nothing bad gon na happen to you lot now . 
  perhaps you see why i 'm not too convinced about that . 
  as spoils of that same war there 's a captured british navy boat in finland . 
  i just wanted to add that . 
   soviet union achieved its goals , even though it took longer than expected . 
  su did not succeed in invading and occupying finland . 
  thanks for stating the obvious , as we 'd be pretty alone if the bear got angry . 
  and indeed it would look grim by the numbers . 
  then again we 've never much counted on anyone really helping us in an actual bear circumstance ( maybe as a lesson from history ) . 
  unfortunately looks like our generations to be are ready cover that : [ imgur ] ( http://i.imgur.com/dhcqsop ), 
  regarding the interest rates greece already has a debt relief program in place . 
  despite the huge amount of debt greece 's interest payments are below eurozone average , and will be kept low for years to come : [ see these charts ] ( http://i.imgur.com/zyoo1ar ) the loans issued by greece loan facility and efsf have very low interests . 
  in fact glf loans are below market funding costs of some euro countries , meaning those countries are in a way making fiscal transfers to greece . 
  please see the latest imf report on greece : http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/scr/2013/cr1320.pdf * the margin over 3-month euribor on the $ 53 billion in debt to the greece loan facility ( glf ) was reduced from 150bps to 50ps , and the 10bps operating fee on efsf lending was eliminated . 
  the glf reduction brings it below the market funding cost of some euro area member states , implying an effective fiscal transfer from countries facing larger effective sovereign borrowing spreads . 
  the change in borrowing terms is estimated to alleviate the debt burden over time achieving a cumulative debt reduction by 2020 of approximately 2.6 percentage points of gdp . 
  * now , a haircut is a different matter . 
  i believe some form of haircut would probably be needed at some point before 2020-2022 to meet the target of reducing the debt below 110 % of gdp by 2022 . 
  to keep greece 's debt as is on that trajectory will be difficult , yet not at all impossible . 
  depends on how greece can keep on with the reforms , and on wider macroeconomic developments in the near future . 
  in short : * 64 .

  in real world on the other hand , we had a law put to vote here in finland a few years ago on gay marriage . 
  one of the parties in government was against it and wrote into the government program that legislation would not be introduced by governing coalition for the vote . 
  parliamentarians introduced the legislation as an independent measure and it passed legislative process , was voted in and signed into law . 
  this possibility exists in most european democracies today . 
  it 's the point that keeps government `` honest '' , by ensuring that if minority within the government uses political machinations to avoid specific legislation that enjoys popular support within parliament from being introduced ... it gets introduced by mps from outside the government instead and will pass and actually written into law . 
  so i 'm happy to tell you that the problem so your carefully artificially constructed has been fixed for many decades in parliamentary democracies . 
  this has nothing to do with `` electorate '' . 
  it has everything to do with enabling mps that are directly elected by electorate to actually perform legislative duties even in face of unpopular resistance from some of the government elements . 
  it 's a norm in parliamentary democracies . 
  on your second point , you appear to be denying the fact that these nice streaming sessions you watch have little to no actual impact on what is being actually put into the directives , as parliament is still largely a rubber stamp for commission that can accept or deny what commission puts before it . 
  if it attempts to append , commission simply pulls legislation and puts it before the parliament again . 
  parliament has no power to vote in measures it `` adopts '' . 
  all those measures go back to commission , which is not compelled in any way to actually keep them in the text . 
  we 've seen these elements quite a few times already , nastiest one being the patent directive which got buried specifically because commission simply would not budge on parliament 's `` amendments '' no matter how much parliament tried to get it to do so . 
  what you are watching on the stream is good theatre . 
  unfortunately , there 's little substance beyond that , due to division of powers within eu power structures . 
  again : emps can propose anything they want , just as i personally can . 
  that 's freedom of speech . 
  what is actually relevant in terms of legislative * power * is ability to actually put these suggestions into law . 
  that power is in the hands of the commission . 
  to fix this , we would need to disempower commission and transfer relevant powers to parliament , which is unlikely to happen for foreseeable future due to power plays within european union power structures . 
  so essentially , you agree with my point in its entirety . 
  however you just quote a large body of technical evidence that demonstrates it to be true ( european parliament has no power to propose legislation , vote on it and have it pass ) , but allows you enough technical leeway to pretend that it still has a `` power to make amendments '' . 
  may i point out that it 's weasel words like these that earn eu it 's reputation is lying , utterly untrustworthy organisation among much of electorate ? 
  i presented a direct critique aimed at the supposedly `` credible '' evidence that used methodology that is utterly absurd and makes it impossible to draw conclusions you chose to quote . 
  your rapid shifting of goal posts implies your agreement with my point , so i rest my case on that topic . 
   and as per your own words it can therefore effectively propose ammendments . 
  do you have reading comprehension issues , or are you perhaps suggesting that just saying to a politician with power `` i would like this done '' is `` effective proposal of amendments '' ? 
  because by your logic , if i go to see my politician at a rally , and ask him to institute a specific law , i have `` effectively proposed an amendment . '', 
  notably my words carry just as much weight as those of european parliament suggestions to commission . 
  frankly , your thesis makes a mockery of parliamentary democracy . 
  as a european , you should be ashamed . 
   the parliament has several ... including voting the law down . 
  no , it has only one method of influencing in a legislative process in a meaningful way . 
  that being vetoing the entire proposal . 
  not just single law , but entire package as being proposed by commission , which is why commission typically bundles legislation with items that would be hard to push through if voted on individually . 
  honestly , what is it with this denial of obvious in terms of eu lately ? 
  are you afraid that if we talk about problems within eu system as they are , eu opposition will increase which is inherently bad ? 
  hint : if these problems are n't addressed and soon , eu does n't have much time left . 
  brexit , regardless of outcome is 50/50 already , and people in other states are starting to inch towards leaving as well because they see that no one is even trying to fix eu , and instead stonewalling and pretentious obfuscation is used to silence anyone pointing out the problems . 
  and democratic political unions do n't survive long when half of their population is against their very existence . 
  if this is n't addressed , next eu parliament elections are going to be a bloodbath for eu supporters . 
  consider reading the report . 
  specifically `` methodology '' . 
  they arrive at their numbers by asking victims of violence that they assist . 
  and then projecting this number to general populace . 
  why ? 
  because charity itself say that it has no clue on how many people of african origin there are . 
  in case you do n't understand math : you can not derive a percentage of total population being `` x '' if you do not know how much total population is . 
  not to even mention polling just the victims it specializes in helping and projecting - it 's like taking a rape charity making a poll among its constituents on topic of `` how many of you encountered sexual violence '' and then publishing a study that says 100 % of women in our societies are raped . 
  you 're looking at two racist bigots basically telling you that : 1 . 
  russian ethnicity does n't even exist . 
  it 's nationality instead . 
  it 's formed of extremely bigoted , evil , subhuman , violent , nazist , chauvinist , [ insert demonising word here ] people , who are pretty much wanting to just start killing anyone who is n't a `` russian national '' ( actual claim of gerbaire above if you follow up the thread ) . 
  it 's folks like these that make russians genuinely afraid of europeans and what we 're supposedly planning to do to them . 
  frankly , i understand them . 
  last time people through this about them , it was nazi germans . 
  not even during the peak of cold war did propagandists lay it this thick . 
   issue being that they are not in control . 
  they are just a part of it . 
   islam itself actually outlines this , in granting specific exceptions to muslims acting against islamic values until they take political control . 
  notably we have countless historic examples of people such as yourself ending up converted or extinct because they believed in the same things you did . 
  yes , reading comprehension . 
  practice it , and do n't quote out of context :  especially when you 're trying to wage a war where parties do n't just hide among civilian population , ** but are civilian population . 
  ** there 's a reason why the war is called `` civil war '' . 
  no , it can not . 
  the article merely allows parliament to suggest changes to commission . 
  there is no mechanism to compel commission to care , which means that this line is dead text . 
  you are factually incorrect that national parliaments can not legislate on their own in europe , just as you are factually incorrect that european parliament can compel commission to introduce legislation . 
  in most of the parliaments across europe , government is a parliamentary majority , and as such , it 's majority in parliament that is proposing legislation . 
  in case of minority government , they are still overwhelmingly parliamentarians . 
  not so for the commission for obvious reasons . 
  i can not be bothered to repeat this point further . 
  you can try to comprehend the difference , or you can continue with the inane point you 're making , that `` saying we want to have this legislation , pretty please , and do n't ignore us ! '', 
  is the same as `` we will propose and vote on this legislation because majority of us supports it '' . 
  or is it just bridal training ? 
  not at all . 
  blasphemy is irreverence or insult or to god . 
  heresy is belief in the wrong god , or wrong kind of belief in specific god . 
  these are different things . 
  problem being , those wives are real scary when you piss them off , or so i hear . 
  ever wonder why those ultras are that violent ? 
  they are just training for the beating they are getting back home :d, 
  you appear to have missed the fact that your claim has been pointed out already . 
  yes , parliament has an effective veto , as it can vote the proposal down . 
  there is however no mechanism that compels commission to make changes to legislation . 
  not before the no vote , and not even after . 
  they may just as well go `` fuck it '' and pull the legislation completely , which makes the `` nuclear option '' extremely unattractive to the parliament if package contains sufficient amount of positive elements . 
  the reason why i say `` one last time '' is because this is not a new thing , and not something that only myself has mentioned . 
  this is in fact mentioned in the original story . 
  i am merely re-iterating the same point . 
  one last time . 
  you can talk about everything you want . 
  parliamentarians love to do it , since that 's all they can really do other than vote . 
  reality is that there is no mechanism to compel the institution that has power to actually introduce legislation to the parliament 's vote , that being the commission , to actually include anything that parliamentarians talk about . 
  and parliament has no power to propose legislation for itself to vote on . 
  which is the power that actually matters , and is typically present in parliamentary democratic systems . 
  the result is that parliament spends a lot of time talking about things that do not matter in the slightest , because commission simply ignores it and puts things to vote as it sees fit . 
  this really fucked up arrangement is basically a mix of national governments being generally afraid of parliament actually being able to make proposals that it could vote on and political elite in europe not being big fans of democratic process ( refer to mr. junker 's infamous political quote about referendum results for example ) . 
  again , it can propose amendments in the same way i can propose you install an anal probe into your anus .

  grexit would help greece much more in the long run, 
   a better candidate would be a basic old age pension , strictly tied to age because everyone gets old after all . 
  ** it would be at the subsistence minimum of the poorest country , ** so we are going to turn romania into florida then are we ? 
  black sea baths for all, 
  what a load of shit , the greek public sector is smaller than the that of the uk in terms of government employers per 100k people, 
  thats a fair point as well, 
  `` capitalism lunging from crisis to bigger crisis '' ? 
  here we are ? 
  http://imgur.com/ku1ntfd i 'd much rather be looking at what 's inside other peoples fridges though but backed out from shame after seeing i only have half eaten kebab shop pizza from last night and 1.5 l cola, 
   who is this `` everyone '' you speak of ? 
  everyone as in ... the court of public opinion , the popular narrative , the majority , call it what you want but i 've noticed a change, 
   `` you live freely if you have n't a reputation to lose . '', 
  i can totally see that on a motivational poster * `` you live freely if you have n't a reputation to lose . 
  '' * * adolf hitler *, 
  you really do n't know how pr works then do you . 
  i have n't been on reddit or following this since friday but that also makes it obvious how the public mood has changed and everyone now sees it as a german takeover of another sovereign nation * #thisisacoup *, 
  sch\u00e4uble the ellen pao of europe , now if only he would just resign as well * #thisisacoup *, 
  i 'd rather live in a log cabin with my reindeer and grow potatoes for the rest of my life than live in the federal neo liberal european union, 
  i 've often said the same about ukraine and it 's inability to wait six months for a democratic maidan instead of rioting, 
   if you 've been following ttip , you 'd know that a good chunk of the documents in this leak have been available for some time from the eu 's ttip website . 
  no , nicely worded pr summary 's have been available . 
  for the same reason i do n't read a car brochure to find out how it runs and what falls off after a few years . 
   ireland is the beneficiary of a fairly secret but very real policy of monetary financing . 
  while potentially illegal and certainly opposed by ecb and eu policy , ireland is actually paying off a substantial part of its debt to itself : ireland 's central bank took over the debt of the infamous anglo irish bank , whose speculative excesses cost the irish economy nearly 20 % of gdp when it became insolvent . 
  this is what i 've been saying for the past week regarding the `` we ca n't brake the rules '' `` our hands are tied by the ecb '' crap that schwable doodle has been singing the only difference between ireland and greece is ireland submitted itself to becoming a neo liberal tax haven for big business and sold off or monetized most of it 's remaining state assets and greece did n't . 
  it 's also worth noting ireland would be dealing with 30 % / 40 % youth unemployment as well if they were n't all highly mobile and english speaking who easily picked up jobs in the us/canada/australia and beyond edit : it 's also worth noting that debt monetary financing seems to be aimed ( in my opinion ) more toward taking the pressure off the current government as there is a very real threat of left wing sein fein taking power next year , the details of the deal stipulate that the bonds the central bank of ireland currently hold are to be sold onto the private market in increments . 
  looks like our dear eu ` eurogroup ' have been having some more secret chats about how to shape europe the way they wish behind closed doors . 
  i can smell the sweet sweet eu transparency from here, 
  oh come on , you think most people want to be part of a european superstate considering how undemocratic and frankly shit the eu has been showing itself to be over the past decade , up here in the north we are too good to have our country reduced to southern levels and the south does n't want northerners telling them what to do . 
  you 're not lying , it may well have prevented it but all that would be happening is we in the north would be paying for greece and well it 's obvious that 's not the position we want to be in so therefore slowly backing away is the logical option apart from that i would say the biggest issue here in finland is that people do n't want our good homogeneous population diluted down with refugees and their good old multicultural values because it 's now obvious how that has been a failure in the uk , france , germany , sweden . 
  people are becoming more patriotic as i 'm sure you have noticed thanks to the problems associated with immigrants and that is the dominant trend , add in some more economic hard years and it will only continue . 
  even stratfor the intelligence agency who are usually pretty on point predict rising nationalism and a possible split in the eu . 
  all people myself included want is a free trade area , even the common currency that saves me a few minutes once a twice a year changing currency is getting old thanks to the lack of economic sovereignty it brings, 
  yes but there is still no reason our side needs to be agreeing with further eu integration and i 'm sure other member states agree so right there you see how we do n't have to be on out own . 
  in fact i 'm pretty sure most finn 's would agree with what i said along the lines of let 's be friends but not get married, 
  finland is not an export economy , as least not anymore as we now run a trade deficit and have done for many years . 
  there is some credit to your claim that having our own currency would mean it would be strong anyway thanks to the silliness of the euro zone but then we are free to print in order to keep it down as sweden have been doing . 
  if they actually tried to discredit geithner that is pretty ridiculous given his standing and credibility . 
  ireland got permission to turn their private banking debt into t bills issued by their central bank with a 40 year maturity . 
  i ca n't find the link now as i 'm on mobile but basically the descussion was , why did the ` troika ' break their own rules when mr germany minister is here saying to greece rules are not to be broken and xyz is illegal . 
  it 's clear to me there is two euro zones . 
  one for the good guys and a debtors prison for the rest they do n't like the look of . 
  and let 's not talk about germany breaking surplus stability and growth rules and france for it 's deficit spending . 
  he 'll even finland is now breaking the the rules as well now but who cares we are good guys right ? 
  thank you , i finally laughed , time to hang up reddit for the night, 
  yes i can only describe it as closest to shrooms overall but as the shaman guy was saying to me it 's a medicine and cleansing process so if your body is sick you may well feel very sick . 
  naturally being where i was i 'd been living off a pretty clean and natural diet in the week beforehand but compared to the shrooms i was far more aware of my body the whole time as in it would have made me mentally and physically sick if i had a big mac in my stomach at the time . 
  other than that peru where i went was great , at first i was afraid of all the shit i might find in the jungle and then after the whole spiritual thing i became pretty comfortable about it and ended up tagging along with some americans who were following a pretty well known alternative route back to civilization , funny thing after two weeks with no contact one of their parents reported them missing and we were met by the peruvian search and rescue but then they turned out to be cool and got a free helicopter ride  i can say for sure such a trip wont make any medical condition worse that 's for sure and when it comes to dealing with death and spirituality it certainly is one of the medicines for the soul and it sure shored up a belief in me that life is by no means pointless nor do we just simply die . 
  i guess the only downside is it might leave you questioning a lot of the shit we do in the name of progress on this side of the world and even make you dismayed with the world around you . 
  i say why turn our ass to either side when you can dance with both . 
  well i pretty much did and experienced the same these finnish `` madventures '' guys did on their gonzo travel show : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glopagbd0k8 basically the spiritual , `` everything is connected '' , there must be a god of some type warm feeling most people report , kind of like we somehow only experience time on a linear plane but that there is a separate non linear that is more in the spiritual but we are not normally aware of , then to be more specific i remembered my own birth and first breaths as if it was yesterday like literally `` seeing the light '' set and setting of course is the key thing with these types of experience so the jungle is indeed perfect and getting there is the metal preparation time but only thing i would do different is not to make it all about the drugs as it 's possible to overhype it . 
  if dmt is like crack cocaine this is like really good cocaine in that you will remember the whole experience and it wo n't just be over in 15 mins but naturally wont be as intense but leaves you time to actually process it . 
  i 'd only ever smoked dmt once before doing that so i was kinda like `` oh this is n't nearly as mind altering as i thought '' but at the same time i learned a lot more about myself and got a lot more from it overall which is a good thing . 
   the reason behind that is the imf analysis that came out . 
  and the imf is basically the international financial arm of the usa so that report and it 's timing is not meaningless either, 
  you left out that vat on medicines is being left unchanged at the lowest rate which caught my eye, 
  nope he 's right , i spent way too much money going to live wild in the amazon for a few weeks , getting one with the nature and eventually taking ayahuasca to meet my soul . 
  not exactly the same thing but i 'd sure be interested to check this out, 
  yep , i 'd like to say there is still hope for change but the `` meh slowly becoming germany would n't be so bad '' has turned to `` no way i want to follow in their footsteps '' soon we 'll be having no kids and throwing away our cultural identity to work our entire lives as efficiently as possible as well . 
  yep , i was calling myself a finnish european for a while as well but it 's fair to say the euro has ruined our economy ever so slowly as well . 
  fact is it 's no fun letting germany decide how your economy is best run . 
  we could really do with becoming more compedative as our exports have been falling back in recent years but hey that 's not our decision now . 
  with debt forgiveness and actual money for investment the country . 
  do n't expect to hear about that thought until the western media has it 's day of gloating about the raw deal syriza got . 
  true but at least more and more of us want to pack our bags and quit rather than continue with the charade or have you heard if the true finn 's success . 
  well i say that because i think we are above germany and france and they are not exactly model society 's . 
  importing foreigners instead of giving their own people time and space to have kids is one in a list of many straws but to put it simply i like our own culture just fine and believe in our leaders ability to effectively rule ourselves without some bueraracat shaping our economy to their liking, 
  truth that your country leads an undemocratic quasi debt colony dictatorship too much to handle twice in one day ? 
  yea they did n't seem to care to much about the deal they did with ireland that now has it 's central bank buying government debt . 
  the most stupid thing about this is the eu has no rules if you are a government that does what it 's told . 
  wait is n't that a sort of dictatorship, 
  and yanis did n't break rules , he just said he had to record meetings to keep track of what was said . 
  in any case who established this ` eurogroup ' and gave them these powers to discuss the future of nations under secrecy, 
   delusional wow , all i read is about how the eu and troika are an undemocratic bunch of economic hitmen trying to turn the rest of europe into the new franco german empire and fuck everything about that . 
  they have used every dirty trick in the book to undermine syriza and i will never forget this , anti eu for life now . 
  it 's pretty ridiculous and the media propaganda machine tried to have a go at yanis for recording the meeting on his phone to keep track of what was said/agreed, 
  well it 's not relevant to the current events considering it discusses a pre election greece brooding about the possibility of a yes vote and the author seems positively hard about the prospect of syriza leaving office, 
  terrible and out of date article, 
  that sounds really interesting , reminds me of the almost as infamous irish letters where the ecb was `` strongly urging '' if not demanding them to formally request a bailout . 
  then there is also this weird deal where they broke their own rules letting the irish state collect payments on bonds it then issues back to the government there which breaks their own rules . 
  http://www.forbes.com/sites/karlwhelan/2013/02/11/irelands-promissory-note-deal/ just goes to show how much rules mean to different debtors or should i say subjects, 
  you took my examples there before i had time to mention them , smoking and climate change . 
  the latter is the probably the most controversial in our time as it really is divisive among conservatives and progressives and science reflects that . 
  unfortunately it seems ( at least to me ) to cause the scientific community itself to get dirty and start ousting some of the paid climate change deniers http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/feb/21/climate-change-denier-willie-soon-funded-energy-industry look i understand the biggest enemy to science is the dodgy scientists that discredit their good work so there is motivation to weed them out but at the same time in the grey areas that are n't of huge importance like climate change there is less motivation to care about one corrupt scientist and ii fear it will only become more common unless we make it independent of business or get more critical with scientists so they sort out their own garbage . 
  at the end of the say i think they need to be paid better for starters, 
  sorry but it 's been brought up many times in a russian context that people comment saying along the lines of `` look at this guys post history '' it 's obvious what their agenda is and such comments are never treated as personal attacks . 
  are you saying i should report all comments referring to the particular and one directional nature of someones post history as personal attacks from now on ? 
   within reasonable amounts like i said ** within reasonable amounts ** anyway i 'm not advocating for anything , the precautionary principle the eu has adopted is just fine by my standards so i hope that answers your questions . 
  but generally speaking foodstuffs and products which have an impact on ones health over a prolonged period that ca n't be lab tested on humans over a long period , the bad design of a car axle might cause you to have an accident but that could then be easily identified and you could be compensated in full . 
  if i get sick in 20 years and by that time it 's been shown that gmo corn actually gives that specific type of cancer it 's very hard for me to prove i eat that specific corn every day and it caused the problem . 
  given those two examples it should be pretty clear what things should be treated with caution . 
  any further probing questions are just you being a jerk since this sort of `` where is the proofs '' shitposting is all you seem to do on reddit, 
  i 'm not talking about any sort of scientific conspiracy , propel just want to get paid for their work and it 's the private industry jobs proving the science private companies want to see that are first of all more numerous and secondly get paid best . 
  it 's just logic and then when you think how science is just consensus based then you see how it can very easily be a problem . 
  sure , maybe they do n't like that word , i 'm sure it 's ok to highlight the fact 95 % plus of their posting history is devoted to just one specific lobby intensive topic though and it 's the somehow implied derogatory nature of the `` sh ** l '' word that 's the issue here ? 
   name a single thing that has been proven safe . 
  water , air , marijuana . 
  of course within reasonable amounts , too much of anything is dangerous i 'm not a scientist but i would presume via every available toxicology test , devise a scale of `` potential for harmful effect '' instead of just `` well i ca n't find anything bad '' and of course it 's observable effect over time on a small scale before mass introduction . 
  but like i said i 'm spitballing shit that 's not in my field but forcing people who do n't want to be test subjects is not the way to go . 
  eh we just did that via 1 trillion in qe to aid banks and big business , why not 400bn to write off one of the biggest political crisis of the eu ?

  these daily show comedians became the only people questioning the status quo . 
  in polls it 's shown that people like colbert and stewart are seen as more trusted than cnn , msnbc , fox and the main newspapers . 
  the responsibility to inform the public was neglected by the news media so comedians have taken over that job . 
  it 's quite tragic . 
  in / r/europe the most sensible comments are downboted and the most xenophobic ones are at the top . 
  so gongrats, 
  naah lets just assume that this proves that every refugee is actually an ungrateful migrant . 
  definitely a huge issue with an eu army . 
  a lot of nations are really opposed to all interventionism , especially because of the experiences in this millennia . 
  i guess that 's why it makes sense to have the army require unanimous support from all participating nations ( at what point is this term obsolete :d ) . 
  but the eu army could surely be extremely useful for enforcing un policy and such . 
  aaa , now that you say so it makes sense, 
  agent provocateurs are real things , but so are violent anarchists ofc, 
  all of them . 
  at least when you 're gone . 
  no but of course a common defense would be in a treaty much like nato 's article 5, 
  the prime cause for such an army would be defensive . 
  the eu has no need of attacking foreign countries . 
  you might not understand this since you have primarily attacked countries ever since the normans conquered you, 
   maybe that is just my german soul and our experiences after ww1 that tells me that . 
  i actually read a paper for school recently and they claimed that this is one of the main reasons that germans think that the central banks should only maintain price levels and not take any further part in the economy . 
  funny how we are shaped by our cultures, 
   germany and france have tried to get get new eu laws trough to regulate the finacial sectors problem is that their visions are sort of different . 
  germany has traditionally been quite monetarist while france is more keynesian , so their visions of what the ecb should do and how rules are enforced means that the eu has a hard time at directing effective policy . 
  the germans especially have a quite punitive view of how the crisis should be handled , it is this german view of things that dominating the eu . 
  so the greeks could blame the french in so far that they are complacent to german austerity through out europe . 
   they just thought the whole western world is evil and all of the people who are not like them just serve the evil . 
  hmm , sound sort of similar to my views :d . no wonder that i think they sound reasonable . 
  no but european values are extremely important . 
  what we actually have done and are doing is n't always as nice . 
  but we should n't lose sight of our values . 
  the rest of the world does n't seem to have so much of it , so we need to compensate . 
   to trow grenades at embassies or stones at police officers wont change a thing . 
  acts of terrorism and vandalism are not tactics i really agree with . 
  but it would ludicrous to suggest that it never has had an important role in implementing change . 
   in the end there is no my or their reality we all live in the same reality . 
  absolutely . 
  which is why it is important to try to understand the viewpoints of different groups . 
  otherwise things like brexit and trump will keep happening, 
  far away from your reality . 
  there is quite a mainstream leftist argument that says that germany and france are the stooges of international finance etc, 
  u wot m8 ? 
  this is why free markets arent inherent\u00f6y good . 
  `` oh our workers want to mane more than 4 euros an our ? 
  guess they wont mind their jobs going to china , haha '', 
  imperialists gon na imperiliaze, 
  the difference between greece and poland would be that the poles did n't want communism and they most definitely did n't want to be dominated by russia . 
  in greece stalin did nothing , the communist there were home grown after fighting the nazis for like 5 years . 
  when britain invaded they mainly did n't fight germans but rather greeks of anarchist/socialist politics who had liberated greece already . 
  greece would not have become a satellite of moscow . 
  rather a part or close ally of yugoslavia . 
  which would n't necessarily have been bad for them . 
  so i 'm sure you see the difference now . 
  britain did n't invade greece out of benevolence but rather out of larger geo political and imperialist reasons . 
  remember the british empire was still existing at this point . 
  greece is really useful for controlling the bosphorus and the suez canal i think . 
   yugoslavia became a non-aligned communist state with very limited soviet or british influence i think that the west actually aided yugoslavia a bit during the cold war but kept it quiet . 
  on the other hand the americans have been indicating that debt relief is a good idea . 
  so at least obama ought to be much more popular than any german official . 
  where does the anti-american sentiment come from ? 
  anger at imperialism of america and britain killing communists and installing dictators after the second world war ? 
  or is it a cyprus thing ? 
  i 'm 21 but i 'm still a fucking baby in many ways, 
  seems kinda fucked up on first look , but you would assume that the german legal process is creible, 
  very interesting . 
  portugal is then seemingly quite close to the brics nations . 
  you would understand if nations like france and germany are upset by this since it might threaten european hegemony somewhat, 
  which is worse in a way, 
  there is something quite satisfying about an `` indian government spokesman '' exercising power over the prime minister of britain . 
  thinking about how much churchill is spinning in his grave gives me great joy, 
  itt : people confusing legality of an act with their gut reaction, 
  do some charity in the jungles of the philipines , better be sure not to talk to anyone who could potentially be an islamic terrorist . 
  you might get murdered by your government . 
  if a government decides to kill specific people a trial is needed . 
  anything else increases the powers of the governments over everyone in the world, 
  you never have a list of enemy combatants to kill . 
  i highly doubt it , at least not in the coming one or two decades . 
  everyone is so interdependent at this point . 
  there is really little reason to reverse to old school nations . 
  the eu can undergo huge reforms though of course, 
  france could as well to be completely fair, 
  join the navy , see the world , catch every continent specific pokemon, 
  this election is pretty interesting . 
  the smaller scale seems to allow for a democracy that is n't quite as easily corruptable and open to new ideas such as those of the pirate party, 
  i disagree . 
  i think european politics is in desperate need of people with alternative ideas gaining power . 
  but in the case of podemos i 'm obviously not as well versed as you, 
  btw while i have your attention do you have any good recommendation of a news source about spain that is somewhat leftist/anarchist/liberal in english ? 
  to me it sounds like there should have been some form of larger possibly centrist coalition government . 
  it is possible in war time so why not now, 
  lol , appearently blairites exist everywhere, 
   moci\u00f3n de censura vote of confidence perhaps ? 
  looking at your politics i would be thrilled to have an alternative to the traditional ruling parties, 
  wahlroos is the finnish example of an absolute liberal right winger . 
  this is a bit funny because it shows that basic income is not some form of radical idea . 
  at it 's core it 's really just a way of managing a system of welfare more cost effectively in a time where less work is available . 
  you can draw parallels to how bismarck created a welfare society to prevent a socialist revolution . 
  if you are a lithuanian and 50 of your countrymen died you probably dont like it gettung trivialized, 
  and capitalist commercials https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgm14d1jhuw, 
  yeah in the circumstances it was pretty alright .

  a roadmap . 
  a clear calendar . 
  no more intentions . 
  and we have seen nothing of the sort . 
  yes , greece has previously made proposals but unfortunately not presented * actual plans with the necessary specifics * . 
  and such plans must be extraordinaly detailed just as the earlier one has been - no-one will accept replacing the earlier detailed plans with new vague ones which can not be even evaluated for their lack of specifics . 
  [ here 's an example of an actual plan with the specifics needed . 
  you 're certainly free to base your views on that . 
  i for one am still waiting for a proposal which incudes an actual plan with specifics , as does the eurogroup and pretty much everyone . 
  you can see from the example in my comment what is meant by having an actual plan . 
  i think many have read the expired proposals . 
  hence the critisism of lack of specifics . 
  here 's an example of what is meant by having [ a plan with specifics . 
   any and all collective bargaining rights have been abolished in greece since the 2012 bailout agreement . 
  if that is actually true then it 's solely greek govs action as the troika never demanded such . 
  the terms have always been about bringing the unions ' operation aligned with international conventions and the best practises in the eu - which was not the case before . 
  in fact such action goes against the moa where it is stated :  the rules for strikes by unions have remained unchanged for over three decades , and greece is an outlier in the eu in prohibiting lockouts , even as a defensive tool for employers during labor negotiations .

  and he 's not wrong . 
  it has to be discussed in any case - even if there 's no grexit . 
  it 's unlikely the banks will open this week , and we do n't know when greece will be able to lift the capital controls . 
  with all the uncertainty the possibility that greece might need humanitarian aid in the near term is there even without grexit . 
   italy 's debt burden now at record high 132 % of gdp though . 
  about 2/3 of that debt is domestic , so external debt is not that high . 
  regarding your original question : italy 's debt is sustainable . 
  the debt profile is favourable , they can service it and are not about to default on it . 
  but having such high debt brings vulnerabilities and risks with it . 
  and a serious shock hitting italy 's economy could lead to a situation where italy 's ability to service its debt could become under risk . 
  for analyses , see [ imf country report no . 
  14/283 - italy ] ( http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/scr/2014/cr14283.pdf )  annex i. 
  debt sustainability analysis  italy 's public debt is sustainable but subject to significant risks . 
  italy 's public debt ratio continues to rise , and at around 136 percent of gdp , is the second highest in the euro area . 
  external financing requirements and gross public financing needs are also large due to the rollover of existing debt . 
  most of the public debt is held domestically . 
  market risks are mitigated by the long duration of debt , much of which is under a fixed interest rate . 
  the main risk stems from a growth shock , in the absence of structural reforms , which could result in an unfavorable macro-fiscal dynamics . 
  contingent liabilities in the financial sector also constitute a significant risk . 
  perhaps it 's related to the problem of arranging short-term bridge financing for greece :  a greek government source confirmed that athens was seeking an interim financing deal to cover its debt service hump over the summer ahead of a longer-term program . 
   the eu sources were reluctant to discuss how greece 's short-term needs would be funded . 
   two sources said it would be a mixture of releasing 1.9 billion euros in profits returned by the ecb to member governments on its greek bond holdings , and ** either bilateral loans from friendly countries ** or a decision by the ecb to allow greece to issue more short-term treasury bills . 
  could that imply passing the hat among the eu-28 ? 
  italy 's pm matteo renzi just confirmed the summit will happen on sunday and that it will involve all 28 eu leaders , not just the ez . 
  well , they were correct in saying there is no way of reviving the second bailout which has expired . 
  releasing those accumulated funds is a separate issue . 
  of course , the problem is that those funds are limited and probably not enough to cover the needs for even one month never mind bridging over several . 
   that 's why we have executive branch , right ? 
  get a job done . 
  indeed . 
  as for the quick bridge financing there 's some funds that could be released to greece quickly and could cover at least some of what is needed . 
  the efsf bailout program ( the second bailout that expired last tuesday ) included mechanisms to pay back to greece the profits that the ecb and other countries made on the loans to greece ( yes , contrary to the popular reddit-meme the institutions and countries have not been making huge profits on the loans ) . 
  as the second bailout program expired last tuesday also those mechanisms expired . 
  yet those mechanisms still have some previously accumulated funds which would have been given to greece if the program had continued . 
  afaik there 's about $ 3.3 bn in ecb , $ 1.85 bn in esm , and about $ 1.5 bn by ez governments . 
  my numbers could be off , but you get the idea : releasing those funds to greece could be a quick process without the need of going through the national parliaments - needs an unanimous decision by the eurogroup though . 
   again , fair point . 
  ecb payment likely takes precedence . 
  imf has the seniority . 
  i do n't know if it 's possible to pay the ecb before first paying the imf . 
  what we 're currently looking at in this clusterfuck : after greece let the second efsf bailout program expire there 's little hope of a quick solution . 
  the current word is ( rumour ) : greece is probably going to ask for bridge financing to take them over july and a couple of months after that . 
  then they would need a new mid-term financing program from the esm mechanism for about 3-4 years . 
  so , we would be looking at 3rd and 4th bailout program for greece . 
  good luck getting that accepted by the national parliaments . 
   state of play in previous 4 euro years ( last 2 tele-conf ) * euro groups he means the past eurogroup meetings and teleconferences . 
  wow . 
  interesting . 
  should have checked the customer 's name back then . 
  [ ` no triumphalism ' ] ( https://pbs.twimg.com/media/cjuafdfweaevswx.jpg ), 
  imposing capital controls was greece 's decision . 
  they had to do it because they had a banking run going on , which was accelerated during the weekend after the greek gov 's decision to leave the negotiations and call a referendum instead . 
  also , the breakdown of the negotiations to extend the bailout program led to the ebc freezing the ela ceiling to greek banks - which was an expected decision and according to their mandate . 
   i was referring to an offer with the same terms . 
  those terms were for the extension of the second bailout program . 
  the extension of that efsf program was feasible both economically and politically . 
  now that program has expired , and there 's no chance of reviving it . 
  if there will be further bailouts for greece that would require a completely new bailout program . 
  while the terms could be superficially similar the terms can not and will not be the same because the new bailout would not be from efsf mechanism but esm which a different beast . 
  also , greece getting a third bailout may not be politically feasible . 
  it will be very difficult to get the ez countries to agree to it and national parliaments to accept it . 
   the age difference in oxi vs nai says it all - older people in the country fundamentally care about a status quo that massively benefitted them and young greeks are watching as their futures are being gambled away . 
  there 's also another aspect to that . 
  the youngsters do n't remember the times before . 
  to an extent you can see that same phenomenom in all eu countries - including some younger politicians who were not participating to the long process when , how and why emu and then euro was formed . 
  older generations remember the times before the emu and euro when european countries competed against one other with competitive devaluations in a race to the bottom . 
  here 's for example frence 's historic inflation rate : http://www.tradingeconomics.com/embed/?s=frcpiyoy&amp;d1=19580101&amp;d2=20151231&amp;h=300&amp;w=600&amp;ref=/france/inflation-cpi, 
  interesting . 
  yet the greek pm tsipras ( syriza ) claimed there would be a new bailout deal ` immediately ' after the referendum , and even claimed that a no-vote would give him better position negotiating that . 
  but you say it was actually samaras wanting that . 
  look , i do n't want to delve deeper into the intricacies of greek politics which are obviously incomprehensible to me but apparently the fact remains that greece does not need a third bailout , and that is indeed good to hear . 
  the media had made me to believe that greece was seeking a third bailout . 
  and it is indeed good to hear they do n't need it nor want it . 
  yea , how dare they . 
  should not have punched . 
  should not have fired .

   but france could easily have imprisoned everyone in the camps let 's steelman your argument here for a moment and assume that you are in fact correct and such measure is possible . 
  what would results be ? 
  would the pressure within the system to go to uk be reduced or increased ? 
  would alternate , far more dangerous and violent means of entry be devised ? 
  would consequences grow even more severe for people in the region around the tunnel and transit services ? 
  unfortunate reality is that pressure is not coming from france nor uk . 
  it 's coming from the early stages of migration `` pipeline '' , that being in middle east and asian regions from which islamic migration is coming from . 
  trying to address narrow range of symptoms on specific border will simply clump the migrants on the other side for a short while , increasing pressure . 
  and as france is far more vulnerable to `` resisting death cult of islam is actually racism '' rhetoric peddled with saudi money in the mass media , population will inevitably rise against such measures as their death toll starts to rise on all sides . 
  at the same time , as young men of arms bearing age , many of whom have combat experience from their host countries get more desperate , you will start seeing even more violent methods of entry , with likely taking of hostages , murders , even organised attacks on police . 
  and these would come not from easily monitorable camps , but from spread out people that coordinate over social networks via their mobile phones . 
  there 's a reason why so many of the migrants in the current wave have high end mobile phones today . 
  these are their tools of organising penetration of each border , blockade and obstacle placed in their way . 
  you need eastern european levels of conviction among populace to resist this kind of agenda . 
  historic examples of what happens when muslims actually overrun and get to rule your country . 
  western europe outside spain and portugal lacks these experiences , making the `` resisting death cult of islam and its adherents is racism '' agenda far more workable on the populations . 
  and populations do elect leaders in western europe . 
  and much of population has indeed swallowed the narrative , and deprogramming only really happens when they come face to face with reality of what large muslim communities actually do to outsiders . 
  problem being that it 's not `` france '' that is the problem . 
  it 's the entire framework under which movement of people is handled throughout eu combined with migrant crisis . 
  it 's a sum of contributing factors , most of which are out of reach of both uk and france to affect to a significant degree . 
  as a result , penalizing oneself and france for it will do very little to solve the problem . 
   i mostly agree with your points , although i would say you probably overestimate ldpr 's popularity . 
  i 'm a history and military buff . 
  every single nationalist movement that gets great and takes over the reigns of a state is severely underestimated at the start . 
  hitler 's and lenin 's platforms were about helping people economically as well at the start . 
  relevance of this history during our times is aptly demonstrated by things like brexit and rise of afd in germany , golden dawn in greece , party for freedom in netherlands and so on . 
  these are people who 's rise to full blown extremist nationalism is only limited by ambitions of their leaders at the moment . 
   if ttip would go through , and us further economically isolate russia and china , in case of russia at basically zero damage to us but weakening both europe and russia , i can imagine a lot of people getting their pitchforks out . 
  this has already been done in the poison pill of unconstitutional overthrow in ukraine and the follow-up where us successfully transformed russia-eu relations from getting ever so closer on all relevant points to new cold war of today . 
  i suspect they underestimated the importance of europe and russia on the middle eastern catastrophe however , which is why they 're de facto aggressively pivoting from asia back to europe and middle east today . 
  that one is now an immediate priority for their geopolitical interests , as europe is no longer able to be the keeper of the floodgates , and russia is no longer cooperative . 
  and their favourite ally in the region , saudi arabia has demonstrated utter inability to fight a war even in a poor and small bordering state of yemen in spite of having fourth largest army in the world . 
  `` us gmo food '' is fast on the way to become `` german gmo food '' with bayer 's monsanto deal . 
  corporations ' economic interests are a whole different pie from geopolitics , and suggesting that these interests are `` national '' is rather naive . 
  honestly most of the anti-americanism is vastly overrated . 
  us citizens are just as stuck with their elites as we are with ours , and their electoral system is even more polarised and protected from any kind of real effect that populace can push on it through democracy . 
  they 're simply nationalist and self-centred , and in real world , that is the sane policy to have . 
  the bride and groom one was the epitome of black humour . 
  literally . 
  well done . 
  problem is that the moment you do this far away from your own people , large portion of said people has been conditioned to scream `` racism '' at that very government . 
  which still scares government officials . 
  the only exception is something violent happens close enough to home , when they feel that extreme measures are actually protecting * them * from the islamic terrorism . 
  fear is the most base of our emotions , which is shaped by evolution to override everything until situation causing fear is resolved . 
  as a result , it overrides the conditioning to whine about racism and same people that have their `` whine about racism '' conditioning triggered in cases when they are not afraid for their own safety , as is the case with calais jungle , accept similar security measures when they are actually afraid . 
  problem being that tunnel is too important for uk itself to shut down . 
  that would be cutting off the nose to spite face . 
   polish people as a whole have an incredible work ethic , and are willing to fucking grind for very little hourly pay because comparative earnings are astronomical between uk minimum wage and polish average wage . 
  when you have a salary that is more than that of a doctor in your home country doing low skilled labour , you 're going to have great work ethic . 
  same would apply to native brits if they got that kind of salary . 
  there is a reason why free movement of labour is genuinely a bad idea . 
  it creates a massive drain of people from poor states to rich ones , and at the same time creates an ever increasing amount of jobless people who can not get jobs because gastarbeiters take them and work for far less than is a living wage in the country . 
  then you have ryanair basically fly these people home every weekend for a price of a bus ticket , so they do n't even spend the money in the economy in which they earn it , and situation fubar is complete . 
  now let that continue for a decade , and suddenly , you have open animosity towards the poor guest labourers where there was none . 
  the real target of animosity should be elites that devise this kind of policy . 
  poles are acting as scapegoats here . 
  these are n't people who get to decide these things , and these are n't people that want to sabotage livelihoods of lower earning people in uk . 
  so close to the terminator . 
  just a little bit less travel and it would have likely gotten full sunlight . 
  personally , i 'm worried about who they are losing the vote to . 
  ldpr looks like the sponge sucking up the votes . 
  that means attitude shift of `` west is a partner '' to `` west is an enemy '' that was being pushed hard for by western hawks has finally started to actually occur on the fringes of population . 
  to get a good war going , you need to convince people on both sides that they are actually enemies . 
  russians have been stubbornly refusing to do so for last couple of years in spite of insane rhetoric used against them around here . 
  it looks like some of them are finally giving up and starting to read giggsters of this reddit as actually representative of our population rather than what they are in reality - propagandist shills trying desperately to convince populations that overwhelmingly ignore their fiery over the top rhetoric . 
  and once that change actually starts , it 's very hard to reverse it . 
  considering how weak europe already is with migrant crisis basically starting to purge the political system from inside in hit countries and brexit being what it is , we 'd need stable relations at least on russian side pretty desperately at this point . 
  middle east is n't going to calm down any time soon , pressure from china is going to keep on ramping up , and us has already shown that they will not allow europe to unite to a degree where it will threaten its dominant position in the world ... we need stabilization more than anything right now . 
  so that is truly bad news . 
  did levada actually receive foreign funding though ? 
  it sounds like a pretty huge mistake on their part if they did , and still wanted to retain their impartial image in the state . 
  especially when you 're a most trusted political pollster in the world where western major foreign policy goal has been destruction of constitutional order in russia for last two years . 
  receiving funds directly from powers that set destruction of constitutional order in your state in that kind of a scenario is going to make you extremely suspect of being a tool serving their interests . 
  the saddest part is that united russia is apparently losing ground to ldpr according to the poll you linked . 
  that 's the extreme nationalist party that has usually been in the fringe , advocating for essentially similar things as us neocons - complete geopolitical domination of nearby states . 
  apparently united russia has n't been nationalistic enough for these voters . 
  if the polling resuts are real , russian public is really circling the wagons even harder under the western pressure . 
  the outcome is the geometric opposite of stated one . 
  putin is ever so popular , and crazy nationalists are apparently becoming more popular than ever while moderates are declining . 
  i not only did read through your points , i even quoted out your points and addressed them specifically . 
  i am here for the discussion on topic , and occasional smacking of too obvious shills such as yourself when they try to present points that are based on fantasies and misconseptions . 
   this is ludicrous , ridiculous . 
  after 25 % collapses , and in the absence of active policy to further shrink an economy ( or absence of war ) , economies just do not behave in this manner . 
  they do if the economy size was a direct result of a massive bubble . 
  bubble deflates and you get the real economic activity instead . 
  with all the cpr greek economy got with essentially free long term loans , it did n't have any inertia in its collapse as bubble economies tend to , and as a result , it went down to the real size of its economy , and is now growing at roughly the same pace as the much of the rest of europe . 
  the `` rebound '' comes from inertia of collapse taking economy too low momentarily . 
  the fact that writer ignores this rather obvious explanation in favour of repeating himself twice on hyperbolic adjectives demonstrates a worrying lack of self-awareness . 
  and in case people forgot , the other major reason here is that main engine of the economy , the young people have left greece during the crisis in droves , mainly due to ease of doing so under eu rules . 
  the obvious problem is that if you 're out of eu in the name of these tax deals - the companies with the deals will leave . 
  the main reason they 're in ireland is because ireland is a part of eu , while having corporatist mindset in its taxation code . 
  that grants said companies all the perks of paying taxes in an eu country , and existing in a tax haven at the same time . 
  the moment ireland exits eu to stay a tax haven , it becomes another shitty tax haven like those small islands in atlantic ocean . 
  not really worth it for major companies due to penalties associated with it . 
  at least it 's not potatoes . 
  / ducks . 
  seriously though , the only thing that would have made it better was if they took a bite out of each apple before sticking it on a fence . 
  it 's still a great protest - funny , on point , does n't really disturb anyone and makes its point in a way that anyone will understand . 
   you could easily get a small-medium-sized ev and rent an ice for your yearly trip to lapland or 3-4 month trip to the cabin just no .

  as a kid we had neighbour family of onni , toivo and rauha ( happiness , hope and peace ) . 
  mom is * \u00e4iti * or * mutsi * and dad is either * isk\u00e4 * or * faija * . 
  mutsi and faija are both helsinki slang , * is\u00e4 * and * \u00e4iti * are the correct terms for mom and dad . 
  siblings , aunts , uncles and cousins by first name . 
  grandma is * mummu * to me and granddad was referred to as * pappa * . 
  american mormon missionary tried to ambush me in a conversation while waiting a tram . 
  i was so flustered i somehow ended up pretending to be deaf . 
  not my highest point . 
  university students have a lot of parties/bar crawls/general happenings where you mix and mingle with students ' from other departments . 
  friends ' friends .

  same for german . 
  i understand writing pretty well still , can navigate swedish or german websites/stores easily and stuff like that . 
  but the good thing is , the basics are now in the brain . 
  if i were ever to move to sweden or germany , i 'd be constantly exposed to the language and i 'd probably pick it up quickly again . 
  so i do n't think all those years of learning were wasted . 
  same in finland . 
  i almost never see it happening here . 
  75k city in finland . 
  edit : exception being if there is [ this particular sign ] ( https://www.google.fi/maps/@62.6047291,29.7530658,3a,63.3y,141.62h,89.31t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1seveg3cgjp5klbvax5-p0bw!2e0!7i13312!8i6656?hl=en-gb ) . 
  if you want to look at the silver lining , the hundreds of millions of dollars of war reparations the soviets demanded kickstarted finnish metal industry . 
  now seen as success stories like nightwish and children of bodom . 
  i have a large red beard , and east asians often stare at me . 
  i think i look normal/nothing out of the ordinary so must be the beard . 
  it may be part of the reason , but not a very big part , otherwise finland would be much lower too . 
  after ww2 finland lost [ over 10 % of its land to russia ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/28/finnish_areas_ceded_in_1944.png ) , with that also access to lake ladoga and the arctic ocean , and one of our biggest cities vyborg . 
  in comparison the area lost was about as big as estonia or denmark . 
  it 's not really a political issue anymore . 
  something like 99 % of the finnish population was evacuated and the lost areas have since been repopulated by russians and ex-soviets . 
  of course there are some people who still entertain the thought of `` get karelia back !, 
  '' , it pops up in the media every now and then , but it 's mostly used in jest for the vast majority of people . 
  ok , last time i had to buy cigarettes was this spring , ca n't remember the brand but it was 6,50 e. 
  probably marlboro red , first thing that came to mind at the store . 
  i thought they raised the taxes again 1st of july so i guestimated ~ 7e . 
  the price of a cigarette pack is 16-24 dollars in the us ? 
  lately i have been regularly playing tekken 7 and civilization vi . 
  also been clearing my bundle backlog of indie point 'n' click adventures , a couple games i recently finished were the silent age , the samaritan paradox and shadows of the vatican act 1 . 
  you can buy cigarettes at almost every grocery store or kiosk , but the government has recently increased the fee for the seller , so stores are limiting the checkout lines from which you can buy cigs . 
  the seller is n't allowed to display any tobacco products either . 
  supermarkets usually have [ these machines at the checkout ] ( https://im.mtv.fi/image/704944/landscape16_9/1024/576/b781bbd90b99a1c933124cf2110a0146/zm/1303429.jpg ) , you have to ask the clerk for the product 's number you want , push the button and it spits out the cigs . 
  a pack of cigarettes costs about 7 euros , but further tax increases have been planned . 
  menthol and other flavoured cigarettes will be banned by the year 2020 . edit : here in the eastern finland black market for russian cigs is alive and well . 
  most people know a guy ( who knows a guy etc. ), 
  who sells cigs for about half the price they cost in stores . 
  plenty of bunkers in the east , most famous one being the salpa defence line of bunkers , fortifications and trenches . 
  [ example photos . 
  ] ( http://retkipaikka.fi/vapaa/salpalinja-viimeinen-este/ ) there are also several bunker museums along the salpa line . 
  technically they are not called bunkers , but korsu instead . 
  in practice they served the same function , were mostly underground and were often made from steel and concrete , though wooden korsus are common too . 
  district heating from a power plant that burns woodchips and peat . 
  if it 's hot , i drink about a bottle ( 1,5 litre ) a day . 
  the minerals , especially kalium ( or i guess it 's potassium in english ) , help keeping your fluid balance in check . 
  [ star of africa ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/afrikan_t%c3%a4hti ) is the first one that came to mind . 
  it 's been very popular for decades , not too complex so kids can play too and i think most finns have played it at some point in their lives . 
  you can also sell the berries tax free , unless you do berry picking for a living . 
  [ and use a device like this ] ( http://www.clasohlson.com/medias/sys_master/8873114927134.jpg ) . 
  in some ways it 's similar to finnish accent , spaniards ( mostly ! ), 
  pronounce the way words are written like finns do , at least when speaking english . 
  it 's phonetically simpler than native english speak , so easier to understand . 
  that 's my theory at least !, 
  spanish one is somehow super easy to understand , even when it 's really thick . 
  unlike thick italian or french accents . 
  i watch a lot of formula 1 and alonso and sainz are really easy to understand , while people like boullier and sometimes grosjean , or fisichella and davide valsecchi , are often difficult to understand . 
  i believe he is doing just fine . 
  i lost interest quickly too , but his other channel , beyond the press or something , occasionally has interesting videos so i stay subbed to that . 
  [ this map shows that there probably are n't boars in the stockholm region ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a9/sus_scrofa_range_map.jpg/1920px-sus_scrofa_range_map.jpg ) . 
  strange , since finland and russia both have them more north than sweden . 
  not really hotness , just a mustard flavour and the texture is more paste-like , thicker . 
  felix has by far the most different flavours in finland , but there are some store brands and smaller companies making it too . 
  herkkumaa being the second biggest brand . 
  in finnish it 's called `` kurkkusalaatti '' , or `` sinappikurkkusalaatti '' ( a bit more mustardy , sinappi being mustard ), 
  no , it was about westerners travelling to countries in the mena region , kinda like this thread . 
  the original point of the thread was something else though , in one `` subthread '' it veered into tourism . 
  everyone agrees on the government 's conservative and religious backwardness . 
  but not getting into that , it is one of the safest countries in the region for visitiors . 
  recently in some thread , ca n't remember the sub , someone said that iran is a safe country to visit and they were downvoted to oblivion and got a lot of `` iran ? 
  are you fucking kidding me ?! '', 
  comments with upvotes all around . 
  propaganda spread by some countries does clearly work . 
  finnish governments travel advisory for iran says security situation is safe and there is no hostility towards foreign tourists . 
  low risk of terrorism and crimes agains foreigners are rare , but areas bordering iraq , pakistan and afghanistan should be avoided . 
  hbo nordic movie selection is a joke , there are like a couple dozens movies and most of those are stand up sets . 
  but the series selection is pretty great . 
  all hbo shows plus some from showtime , amc , fx , bbc , etc. 
  i rarely watch movies anymore anyway so this is perfect for me . 
  i cancelled netflix when they blocked the us , uk & canada vpn workarounds . 
  huh . 
  did n't know about that . 
  i only checked the irish embassy site in italy and they said a passport is needed for the irish , maybe it 's more lax the other way round . 
  did you go straight to ireland from the schengen area or via uk ? 
  because ireland and uk have a common travel area thingy with themselves , no passport checks . 
  kinda like a smaller schengen , or similar what the nordic countries had before schengen . 
  once you got to the uk with your passport , you did n't need it anymore because of both of them being in the eu stuff . 
  ireland is n't in schengen , so irish people need a passport to enter the schengen area . 
  you 're all good .

  i believe the problem is not only rising tuitions , but the fact that even bankruptcy does n't wipe student loan debt in the us . 
  i find this strange , you are not guaranteed a job after graduation but have to take huge financial risks to graduate , while almost all other kind of debt clears with bankruptcy . 
  yup , most of the costs of installing a toilet is from plumbing and connecting to the sewage system , the actual bowl is the cheapest part . 
  [ it 's time to kick ass and chew bubblegum , and i 'm all out of gum . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0gz4y9w6o0 ) could n't be more american . 
  one that 's not mentioned , americans are always chewing gum . 
  fun fact : finland 's most popular chewing gum brand is jenkki ( yank ( ee ) , meaning all americans not what it means in america ) . 
  yes , accessed from the bathroom , [ this gives you an idea ] ( http://www.blosius.fi/images/kylpyhuoneremontti_palin_0703_tuomarila-2.jpg ) . 
  even many single room/studio apartments nowadays have a sauna . 
  also most houses have the sauna inside , not as a seperate sauna building in the backyard , although those are not unusual either . 
  some apartment buildings in finland have a communal barbecue spot on the inner yard of the building . 
  and `` chinese '' : hui lai lee = one having a break, 
  here 's a good example of what makkaraperunat , or mp , or paskalaatikko ( shitbox ) etc. 
  technically that 's a british movie , according to imdb . 
  now i know why colbert used to say that `` oregon is the canada of california '' .

  agriculture -  heavy industry  services sector . 
  the only factually correct point in your entire post . 
  what you miss however , is that first phase is the phase with no middle class , second phase is the one with middle class , and last phase is the phase of withering middle class . 
  actually read up on economics instead of just pretending to find out more . 
  while your pm talks about how well it 's going , your country 's cancer patients are dying in treatment queues , schools push out people that ca n't even manage proper swedish , and your big cities are starting to resemble the places where their ghetto dwellers are coming from . 
  but according to you , that 's a success story . 
  you used to have it pretty good . 
  not anymore . 
  the numbers when properly polished still look good . 
  reality on the ground is all together different , and that 's not just my opinion . 
  now you 're just sad in your ignorance . 
  one of the main reasons that western civilization got the current point is factory work . 
  it demanded that people move to cities , where they organised and started demanding reasonable wages . 
  which lead to birth of middle class . 
  with factory jobs largely gone , middle class is slowly withering away across the world , outside countries where factory jobs are still present ( i.e. 
  china ) . 
  and yes , that includes sweden . 
  one of the main reasons as to why most migrants are ghetto dwellers in your country is because there is no heavy industry with lots of jobs to give them a way to integrate into society through work . 
  robots have already replaced much of labor . 
  you 're so late for the party , it 's not even funny . 
  that 's why factory jobs are half gone in developed countries already . 
  the growth comes from the fact that they 're slowly getting cheap enough to replace people . 
  the formula is easy . 
  `` can robot replace human at less cost '' . 
  when answer becomes `` yes '' , you replace the human . 
  and that job is never coming back , because robot will keep getting better - human stays the same . 
  that 's why i keep talking about `` geography '' . 
  it 's not that bad of a hint , is it ? 
  which are located to the east when you look at the map . 
  which is my point . 
  my only claim is that i 'm not a mind reader , and neither are you . 
  i was referring to your people moving east for high paying jobs . 
  mainly due to geography . 
  i see . 
  i assumed that most people just travel over the border to work in nearby region ( kind of like danish-swedish border works ) or alternatively just move to the other country to basically permanently reside there alongside their immediate family . 
  to my understanding , most of them are not gastarbeiters but ukrainians that live in russia and have done so for a long time . 
  that is not necessarily relevant . 
  many people become extremist in certain views when they find religion in their adulthood . 
  because there 's a very active turf war between us intelligence organizations , and signals intelligence is nsa territory . 
  they 'd start a massive shit storm within us intelligence systems should cia encroach on their turf in a significant manner . 
  this has nothing to do with `` communist era '' . 
  pretty much everywhere in nordics you must tell the authorities where you live . 
  authorities have to plan things ranging from basics like how many doctors offices , ambulances , fire fighters and police are needed in each region , to knowing where you are to be taxed for regional taxation and so on . 
  it 's a sign of working state structures more than anything if such data is readily available to authorities to plan how to set up the minutiae of the civil society . 
  housing is n't affordable in finland either , especially in helsinki . 
  it 's the cultural aspect around here . 
  once you go get your higher education ( which is what most people do ) you are expected to move out and strike out on your own . 
  for men , mandatory military service helps this further , but essentially forcing all young men and women that volunteer to go through a period where they are fully weaned off their parents . 
  but yeah , a lot of parents still offer their kids services like doing their laundry or sending them home cooked meals . 
  especially if they live close by . 
  i moved to a city almost 200km away from my parents , and my mom would still ask me to bring her my laundry to wash when i would visit every once in a while . 
  things like military may wean you off your parents , but they do n't wean moms off taking care of their children . 
  this is a video of the production cycle . 
  just publishing that alone is a far graver crime than everything else put together and multiplied by ten . 
  the damages the company could sue for revealing specifics of their manufacturing process alone would ruin any of these people for life . 
  he 's not wrong . 
  if you have jobs , it 's always someone from the east that does most menial parts of it . 
  we have a whole bunch of estonians and russians doing similar stuff here . 
  and to be fair , even specialist jobs are given to them . 
  not only are they much cheaper , but they can also have some really good specialists . 
  i recall having a friend who did welding qc work in wharf in turku back when it was owned by stx ( i.e. 
  koreans ) , he was talking about how about half of his qc work is for that done by russians , and they have amazing qualifications . 
  many of them are actually certified to weld even specialist work done on submarines . 
  in russia , it 's the asians , usually from former ussr that work there . 
  not sure if ukraine 's pay is good enough to allow for the same thing to happen there . 
  overall , in europe it 's `` folks from the east work in the west '' that rings true , with exception of spain and portugal . 
  the one truly valid reason to have eu . 
  it 's too big to be pushed around by foreign capitalist interests , and therefore can actually maintain rule of law even in face of massive pressure . 
  vikings were the sea fairing people that lived mostly on the northern side of baltic sea basin during age of vikings . 
  finno-ugric people living around gulf of finland were among them later on , though historically evidence has been rather scarce , as most evidence of vikings has been in writings of their enemies . 
  they started in modern southern sweden , norway and denmark , and then expanded across the baltic sea , and eventually all the way down the major rivers all the way to black sea and even mediterranean through atlantic . 
  due to the nature of their conquest , they sired progeny even in places where no major viking cities have been known to exist . 
  if i have , it was entirely unintentional . 
  it does n't specify the time frame , but if this is from the time when us also nailed intel for monopoly , the fine is far too small . 
  for those that do n't remember , it went as follows : amd releases it 's k7 microarchitecture , which for the first time in its history wipes the floor with intel 's microarchitechture of the time in all relevant metrics . 
  seeing the superiority , amd predicts significant demand for the chips , and builds a factory to meet this demand . 
  demand does indeed materialize , but oems like dell , hp and so on are all `` sold out '' on amd hardware . 
  in spite of amd having chips to sell them from the new factory in droves . 
  investigation reveals that intel had a deal where it gave oems illegal anti-competitive rebates should they maintain high percentage of their total pc sales on intel 's platrform . 
  going below this percentage would cost makers these rebates . 
  that means they could not meet the demand for amd hardware without breaking this limit . 
  so they were chronically `` sold out '' on amd pcs in spite of massive demand and availability of hardware to build these pcs from amd . 
  intel got slammed with record fines for this in us , but in reality , even careful calculations say that financial benefits in extra profits for intel was somewhere between 4 and 6 times the amount of the fine . 
  this action also crippled amd , which was in debt due to building the factory , and not being able to sell the hardware to oems to build systems out of due to the illegal actions of intel . 
  the specific point of star trek was in fact to showcase dystopian future where even the nationality that was utterly demonized at the time of creation ( such as russians during cold war in us ) was shown as a great friend and subordinate of `` typical flamboyant but skilled us leader '' . 
  japanese by comparison were close allies of us at the time of creation of characters in question , so that was n't as controversial . 
  racially , far more controversial was character of uhura . 
  black woman who is highly erudite and capable , serving as a communications officer ( one of the nastier cliches of the time was that black women were highly uneducated and simple ) and even going as far as getting the first interracial kiss on tv . 
  her character was literally a result of push by martin luther king himself , who had personally convinced the actor playing her to stay on after the first season `` because this role is where you are not a black character , but equal character '' as i recall it . 
  are you in the middle of major city ? 
  these kinds of rates are usually affordable in major cities , where large amount of subscribers within small geographical distance allows pushing rates down . 
  if you live outside major hubs , the costs skyrocket , as you need similar infrastructure , but costs have to be spread across far fewer payers . 
  that means less infrastructure and slower speeds to keep costs reasonable . 
  as far as i understand it , they actually left much of their progeny where ever they settled after the age of vikings came to an end . 
  rurik settled in novgorod and became the sire of the royal house of muscovite russia and then russian empire . 
  many vikings spread throughout the major cities that were linked to trade routes , not just to byzantine . 
  essentially many of the finno-ugric peoples spread throughout the region across eastern fennoskandia and modern western and northern russia have some kind of viking descent . 
  some spread as far as volga river . 
  viking civilization , being sea and river fairing civilization spread alongside water surfaces , where their boats and their unique naval combat skills enabled them to push thousands of kilometers down the rivers , as far as river access allowed it . 
  but vast majority of their progeny , at least genetically , still resides in fennoscandia .

   journalists having their own views and biases . 
  that 's true too , definately . 
  you present 50 + % of voters as if they have absolutely no clue . 
  i do n't believe that 's how it is . 
   mainstream media is mainstream because it 's the most reliable while i agree that most blatant lies can be found in alternative media sites , the mainstream media has it 's agendas . 
  what is talked about and how . 
  most owners of msm are part of economic elite , and that affects their agendas . 
   romania has great engineers and hopefully a bright future . 
  most crucial part is to start founding their own companies and exporting . 
  if you mean sarkozy , he has been for limiting immigration in his later speeches . 
  i do n't have the links at hand though . 
  `` two-speed '' might sound nicer to eurocrat comrades . 
  did he recommend throwing molotov cocktails ? 
   process their rejection and kick them out is a reasonable action plan . 
  and in case of strong and stupid unions and relatively high salaries , plus fixed currency , you will slowly bleed employment to lower cost countries ... 
   if you open it up for severe crimes , despite all constitutional and human rights concerns , people will very quickly demand to deport refugees for lesser crimes . 
  you are saying this like it 's something horrible . 
  there is a bunch of immigrants in jails that absolutely should be deported , even if they had to run for their lives occasionally in the other end . 
  how stupid and uncontrolled you have to be anyway to commit serious crimes if you honestly run for your life ? 
  there was some kind of deportation agreement made between eu and afganistan , just a few months ago . 
  the process was lead by germany , i believe . 
  that 's how it should be done . 
  i do n't know how cooperative libya is though . 
  ( where the euro-immigrants are coming ), 
  the insurance might not cover . 
  the source of his patience , maybe . 
  i think us starting school the year we are 7 sends us down in this index . 
  and just when i thought i was out , they pulled me back in, 
  some claim that the venetian top families moved large parts of their wealth to amsterdam , when venice started to lose it 's power . 
  they could also change their name to `` doctors with borders '' . 
   ` asian ' generally only refers to indian or pakistani . 
  i thought this is an anglo-american thing ? 
  when you do n't have time to think , the winter goes past in a hurry !, 
  own food production , some of it , is pretty important also in case of some kind of crisis , or conflict . 
    government use my tax money to pay for illiterate immigrants  somebody needs to pay your pension when you 're an old fart and there 's no magical vault where all your contributions where kept apart and are just waiting for you to collect . 
  it 's very debatable if illiterate immigrants ever get to the position where they become tax * payers * . 
   rt is 100 % russian propaganda . 
  sometimes they report things that are good to know , because they also suit kremlin agendas . 
  of course one should expect bias then also . 
  and how would some outer party inspect that ? 
  if a group of nordic reporters say : `` no , we do n't self censor , the environment is fine ! '', 
  how would they know if that 's true ? 
  no , you just squeeze them a little bit more . 
  the steel company ex-workers go to government tit , and you raise prices , maybe after a year or two 5 % , then when they are used to it , maybe 5-10 % more , and so on . 
  do you really think that juncker is going to change it ? 
  well , their position is a little bit different , but amazon can `` subsidise '' it 's prices for a long time . 
  a relatively wealthy nation can do that for even longer time . 
  but you have a good point . 
  as long as he drinks coffee , yeah . 
  let 's put it this way . 
  if all competition would be bankrupt/out of business , would amazon keep the prices as cheap as they are ? 
  so they can sell their own products instead , in higher prices ? 
  lots of european industries use processed steel . 
  exactly , it 's not fair competition on their part . 
  `` europe '' can be based on co-operative organizations , but eu is a power structure , a hierarchical one . 
   i have a frank temper i 'm frank in tallinn and earnest in stockholm . 
  that works nicely , for a while . 
  we can vote , but as one statesperson said : `` what difference does it make ?! '', 
   sharing knowledge and expertise , ... tackling problems that can only be approached at sufficient scale and so forth . 
  that 's true . 
   faster and more capable organisation , very debatable . 
  and specifically , what does it do , if they can make fast decisions that are shitty for the finnish province ? 
  and i have hard time coming up with evidence of fast decision-making . 
  and the rest is jingle bells and shopping frenzy . 
  there 's quite a lot in biology , chemistry and medicine . 
  at least in finland . 
  there 's some kind of trend in those fields , i believe . 
  they should mention it on the package though . 
  english could only be used between union officials . 
  english is already the working language in some nordic companies , e.g. 
  storaenso and nordea , i believe . 
  ( i mean when finns and scandinavians are both present/in e-mail chain ), 
   once we 're wealthy , homogay countries more money , muscle and mustache , and your chances skyrocket . 
   waterhose them ? 
  teargas them ? 
  cops have to use quite hard measures to contain people who resist them in our home countries . 
  maybe those same measures ? 
  and if there is a lot of people , water and teargas , maybe , why not . 
  how did you find out ? 
   beats you at being gay and mustache . 
   besides , issuing debt with close to zero interest rates is a limited risk anyway . 
  as long as you can pay it off , and are not forced to just roll it over with higher rates . 
  and i guess there the risk is limited too . 
  i 'm proud to be european , but it does n't mean i want more eu . 
  europeans are the best or close to the best in basically everything . 
  vitamin d helps too , in addition to coffee and alcohol , of course . 
  st. petersburg is a bit too close for nuking . 
   someone somehow got his hands on a military grade rifle , with the intention of selling it . 
  that has to be prevented in the future . 
  you ca n't fully prevent that by laws . 
  especially ones trying to prevent hunters getting their rifles . 
  teutoburg is the most german and most asterix-name ever . 
  well , my muslim neighbour works at the university , but that does n't tell everything about all muslims . 
  so i agree with `` not every ... '' . 
  but if you look at the employment stats and crime stats , those are the reasons that something should be done to halt the mediterranean influx . 
   i dont think brown people living in europe is such a big problem , it 's not about the skin colour , for many . 
  it 's the different culture , different educational and working background/habits that make things difficult . 
   because we want to prevent situations like they happened in many countries during the holocaust . 
  this is not really fitting comparison . 
  mena immigrants are quite different than for example jews at the time .

   as ukraine stares into the abyss , where is europe 's leadership ? 
  busy trying to stabilize the situation . 
  not trying so hard to be loud is probably the most effective way forward right now . 
  whether you see the current leadership in kyiv as legitimate or not , new elections for no doubt legitimate leadership are set for roughly 1 month from now , it 's time to start focusing on that . 
  additional note : 80 % of russian crude oil goes to eurasia , the eu countries being the most prominent importers . 
  that 's \u2248 35 % of the russian gdp coming straight from europe . 
  yes , but banks are all international in one way or another . 
  you can not sanction a russian bank and expect only russian victims . 
  historically foreign sanctions against regular people rarely ends well . 
  `` we 're imposing sanctions on `` bank abc '' because our fellow citizen `` def '' has assets and shares in said bank . '', 
  or `` we 're imposing sanctions in `` bank abc '' because we speculate that fishy trades have taken place . '', 
  try explaining that to the populace who have their life-savings in that bank . 
  a sanctioning move against a billionaire would have very little effect compared to all collateral damage it would result in . 
  no billionaire has their assets in only one basket . 
  all banks are like this , if we impose sanctions because of the clients and trade that happen in these banks , then dutch and english banks should have to go as well . 
  regular people would be the real victims here . 
  timchenko holds finnish citizenship , as do the rotenbergs . 
  eu can not sanction one of it 's own citizens . 
  last conscription in ukraine was set for autumn 2013 , so it was about to be abolished . 
  here 's one : http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2013/feb/15/ivan-kashinsky-photography-roma-buzescu this is n't the one i originally read , and is much shorter , but it supports my statement . 
  the projects were approved . 
  the roma who acted as demolitioners were n't given the factories or the land , they were simply given the job to tear down the factories because nobody else would . 
  they made a good chunk of money shipping the scrap elsewhere . 
  that 's still how the industry works , however today you 're usually paid to do the job at a price . 
  but back then there were no resources to do so . 
  the cofferts were empty so giving the scrap was the only way to get someone to do it . 
  again . 
  the metal was n't stolen , the tear-downs were given away by the state because someone had to do it . 
  letting factories just rust and fall is bad for the environment and would have made the lots unusable in the future . 
  the state did n't have the resources to coordinate the project so it was given away . 
  the landlot still belonged to the state . 
  do n't always assume the worst ... 
   the tear-downs were given away . 
  do you understand that sentence ? 
  they did n't steal anything . 
  the tear-down of the factories were literally given away/sold cheap because the state did n't have resources to do anything productive with it . 
  and how many russian oligarchs today did n't do the same ? 
  the fall of the soviet union was a golden opportunity . 
  the factories were long abandoned , rusting and useless . 
  the tear-downs were given away because there was no power in place that would do it otherwise . 
  it 's debatable in reflection , but legal at the time . 
  for those saying this is money from organized crime : i 've read this story several years in a row now , it seems to pop up every couple of months even here on reddit . 
  i recall that the rich roma of buzescu , along with many other roma clans , ** got rich completely legitimately ** selling scrap metal from abandoned factories after the fall of the soviet union , netting several billions in todays worth combined . 
  people need to realize that roma are n't one group of people , they are a collection of hundreds of clans across europe all having their own culture traits . 
  the majority are n't beggars or traffickers !, 
   but the snow is n't left on the roads for the winter in cities snow goes away if it has n't snowed in a while , but even then the road is too icy enough for the majority of those who bike to abstain . 
  however , bicycle lanes , even in helsinki , are covered with snow all through december-march , depending on weather obviously . 
  it 's even worse in smaller towns . 
   they also continue so through the year . 
  some , the grand majority switches to public transport or car . 
  that is true but it still does n't add up , remember that we 're talking about bicycling as a primary form of transport , not people who occasionally take the bike to work or the store . 
  even in helsinki bicycle lanes are poorly coordinated compared to having lived in the netherlands . 
  unless your office happens to be situated on the right side of helsinki , or in the centre , you would be suicidal if you took your bike , cars will simply not give you room . 
  not to mention that there is n't a public parking system , you 're lucky if a building has a parking rack for more than 5 bikes . 
  again , i 'm not doubting that they have reached this conclusion , i 'm just saying that there 's something legitimately fishy here i.e. 
  they have forgotten to take all factors into consideration . 
  i need to dispute the relevance of this poll . 
  there 's absolutely ** no chance ** in reality that finland scores this high being the sparsest country in the eu , not to mention the 4 months of snow . 
  this could hold true if they had only asked people living here in the capital region , which they probably did ... 
  the problem is not that we simply do n't have the resources to create a common stance on things . 
  the european way is to go to the un before doing anything , as opposed of the us taking an aggressive stance from the beginning . 
  the last thing we need is to develop a bad relationship , or even a frontier , between the eu and russia . 
  russia is a significant trade partner with the eu . 
  namecalling is counter-productive if you hope for any diplomatic talks to succeed . 
  most toyota supra mk4 : s in europe are japanese imports , so they are rhd anyways . 
  lhd supras can cost up to 2-3x more due to rarity . 
  i calculated that it would be cheaper to commute from a family sized apartment in central tallinn to helsinki with a small personal helicopter ( robinson r22 ) than to buy a similar family sized apartment in central helsinki . 
  helsinki is in a housing bubble . 
  the french rate is 15.5 % social security and 19 % `` real '' capital gains tax for a total of 34.5 % , so it 's already . 
  previously as a non-resident you only had to pay the 19 % but hollande changed that . 
  you do n't circumvent taxes , you circumvent income tax . 
  income tax is progressive and is determined based on the amount you earn . 
  capital gains is flat whether you earn $ 1000 or $ 10m . 
  in france capital gains is 34.5 % . 
  in france investment income capital gains can be taxed at source at the rate of only 24 % . 
  this only applies to executives who exceed $ 1m in money earned from a `` salary '' or a `` wage '' . 
  these are not the `` rich guys '' that will bring in a lot of tax revenue . 
  the real rich guys earn their money from capital gains , which is n't covered by this tax . 
  and when talking about executives , companies can just start paying them in stock and financial securities/derivatives and the executives too will be exempt . 
  i also thought it sounded good at first . 
  however , there 's usually a `` but '' to fast-track `` solutions '' like these . 
  let me explain why this is a solution on the expenditure of how much we value citizenship , essentially an instant depreciation of your freedom as well : citizenship is not only a mere passport that gives you rights to travel the lands as a citizen , it 's also means the country has an obligation in the eyes of other countries to take full responsibility for you . 
  by revoking citizenship a country does n't just renounce said persons right to citizenship , the country also forces another country to take responsibility for these people . 
  this is why we have statements of temporary vs permanent ** recidency ** in the first place . 
  the whole deal with these is that they are statements you can revoke because they are n't a foreign contact , it 's strictly a domestic agreement . 
  when people start revoking the higher standard you actually downgrade/deprecate the value of citizenship to `` residency '' status . 
  so what should be done ? 
  do not take on people , aka responsibility , you can not handle in the first place . 
  do n't accepct people you have doubts about or at least stand up for the responsibility you accepted . 
  if it was as easy as just deporting all criminals over the english channel then it would already have been implemented . 
  is it a possibility that they will ban reddit ? 
  because there sure is content even i would call disturbing on here . 
  i think we can agree that those are valid points . 
  however , we are talking about children . 
  can a child take a decision like this ? 
  because the last problems we want a terminal ill child to experience are those adding more mental stress and pressure with a matter they can not fully comprehend yet . 
  e.g how do you tell a child that this is a possibility ? 
  because many sure wo n't even know that the term `` euthanasia '' really exists , let alone that it is an option for them . 
  children are labeled children because they are n't rational people , yet . 
  a child is not going to consider all his/her options independently like you and i do , a child asks for input from other people .

we drink a shit ton of coffee tough, 
  i heard paris amells like piss because nobody bothers srarching for toilets when out they just find the nearest bush,

  uuh , there was a monster truck accident and uuh , some record heat i guess, 
  those wheels can do some serious damage, 
  wouldnt work in finland because on of our isp is named dna, 
  i think they stopped importing all food product from finland not 100 % sure , there was atleast a surge of russians buying all the stores empty by the finnish side of the border, 
  where the hell does these fuckers get motherfucking hand granades ? 
  hang their soul ? 
  hanged by the neck until dead, 
  but in this case it was made to cater to islamists, 
  good thing i moved away from sweden . 
  the multicultural thing is getting out of hand, 
  circus finlandia is starting soon here in oulu other than that pretty much nothing because school starts in about a week, 
  oi we are not addicted to vodka * hides 5 litre vodka bottle * i 've been clean for 3 days now , thats a record, 
  the private school i went to here in finland had linux on all computers ( this was about 2003-2008 ) we were taught basic animation and programming on them and we also played that pinguin game when we had free time, 
  umm ... hi , i brought cookies, 
  hey if our pres wants to learn about flowers who am i to judge,

  dont make me laugh, 
  and what does corruption have to do with equality ? 
  every country will have some corrupt assholes from time to time, 
  i do not know what you find funny,

  i didnt actually want to go to torinranta but my friends are forcing me to socialize, 
  it might also be vappu and die . 
  i certainly have a high chance of dying today, 
  til im considered blond in some countries, 
  wait . 
  did something happen ? 
  my dad has 2 saunas 1 he uses in the summer the other for winter, 
  i would have loved to go but i couldnt due to my mental `` stability '' . 
  altough i am in the reserve if anything would happen, 
  i cant put my tounge on it but i know that place , maybe talvikangas ? 
  right now its like -20 in sy\u00f6te , so good skiing weather, 
  its usually a t-shirt a sweater and a jacket for the upper body and boxer , longjohns and jeans for the lower body, 
  ah okay , i was a bit confused because my brother is gay and married, 
  what does the other type of partnership mean ? 
  we had snow yesturday here in oulu but it melted today, 
  nope , the lights on my car suddenly died at the wrong time wrong place . 
  i hated that car . 
  typical peugot, 
  i know that guy , he gave me a fine once . 
  nice guy, 
  i dont know if were even talking about the same school anymore . 
  oh well , more for me, 
  nope she has never eaten her own vommit, 
  youre lying about the praying thing , it never was like that, 
  when was that i went to the same school 03-08, 
  my whole family loves salmiakki and even my dog loves it, 
  what do you mean ? 
  i love salmiakki and always has, 
  natural born talent , i dont know any finns that hate salmiakki, 
  you would fit right in , almost everyone here in finland is quiet except when drunk, 
  wat , i live in oulu and have never experienced that . 
  wich school did you go to ? 
  already won before it even started , yeaah high five !, 
  ( seriously tough , i have no idea what these are supposed to be ), 
  my phones camera is broken so i couldnt take a photo , i will take my camera with me next time im in the centrum and see if i spot new ones, 
  if only i could make this up, 
  i saw them in torinranta and rotuaari, 
  and that sticker is going to do anything ?

  this goes deeper than refugees or `` feminism '' or whatever reddit is obsessing over this week . 
  amazon.de is getting really good . 
  they 'll find a way to cope . 
  what 's important is rhat the rest of the eu sticks together . 
  things are about to be very scary for a while,

  there was an article a few weeks ago about deportation flights to iraq . 
  a lot of those who are denied do n't want to stay anyway, 
  over the past year the agency says it had rejected about half of 28,216 asylum applications while approving about one quarter of them . 
  fourteen percent of the applications were written off and eight percent were dismissed before being processed .

  animal rights people burned busses amd you blame leftists and pro-immigrant groups . 
  okay . 
  i need to search for it , but it was poliisi 's own numbers . 
  it was highly upvoted in the last thread about this here . 
  things were really weird last fall . 
  they have mostly gone back to normal , but the media amd populists tried very hard to scare people into feeling a certain way . 
  a result of this was a lot of hard-working people with dark skin feeling really unsafe for a few months . 
  things are fine now . 
  you 'll be fine . 
  you might get drunkenly bothered but if you say you 're working/studying those people usually back off , as terrible as that sounds . 
  during the height of the refugee crisis last year , my indian coworker had a few really shitty experiances with people yelling racist stuff at him , but thankfully it never went further than that . 
  report anything to the police if you ever feel personally targeted or afraid . 
  have you ever been to finland ? 
  we do n't really have antifa , just some wannabes . 
  you 're free to look up the 2015 crime stats for far right vr far left crime in finland . 
  far right had double the instances with many of those being assaults and other violent crimes . 
  far left was mostly ignoring the police and things of that nature . 
  i 'm getting tired of non-finns/people not living in finland bringing up antifa or `` far left violence '' . 
  we do n't have all that much violence to begin with , that 's why people hate the finnish resistance movement - for trying to encourage violence . 
  thiscgets reposted every few weeks and nothing has changed since the last repost , so i 'm removing this . 
  there 's still some weird stigma on reddit about calling nazis nazis , though . 
  a year ago , if you 'd said this in certain subs , you 'd have been called a leftist sjw who hates finland and blah blah blah . 
  it 's better now , but it was really bad at one point . 
  certain groups on reddit really tried to spin the idea that neo-nazis were n't nazis , just concerned , average people fighting against the letists who hold them down - despite not a single left party being in the current government in finland . 
  the finnish resistance movement is a neo-naxi group . 
  before anyone shows up whining about the classification , please google them . 
  they deny the holocaust amd harass immigrants and politicsl `` opponents '' regularly . 
  these people do not need to be defended in any way . 
  they are the definition of scum . 
  they litter my town weekly with racist flyers , usually near schools and playgrounds . 
  they take photos and videos of people without their permission and get right in their face to try amd instigate the other person to attack them . 
  they keep registries of people they do n't like/people they consider traitors and many of them have been charged for doing so . 
  they are neo-nazis . 
  let the downvotes pour in . 
  i 'm the one who has to constantly worry about these losers beating up my friends , not you . 
  this thread would make more sense in / r/askeurope or / r/askuk . 
  thanks . 
  yeah . 
  i go to lidl every so often to browse around , but unless they 're having super lauantai or something prisma is almost always cheaper . 
  the whole `` lidl is cheapest '' is just clever marketing . 
  i have a few friends who refused to accept this until i started sending them pictures of my reciepts . 
  lidl is n't that cheap anymore . 
  prisma is actually the cheapest place to buy groceries .

  are there any statistics available about gender and age those arriving greece ? 
  they all get registered there now so probably this statistics should be available somewhere ? 
  but none of them are really asylum seekers . 
  just economic migrants pretending to be refugees to abuse european welfare systems . 
  finland and russia have undersigned an agreement already long time ago that russia must check visas and other documents before letting people to border zone . 
  about two months ago russia just stopped applying this agreement anymore without any valid reasons . 
  so how are deportations going at the moment ? 
  any hope that at least most of them could be deported ? 
  maybe directly back to their home countries if russia is not cooperative . 
  we got mainly people that had lived in russia for years . 
  russian economic problems made the nordic welfare state to look very attractive to them . 
  understandable but not a really a valid case for asylum . 
  if i have understood it correctly , russia is not that interested to become a `` transit country '' between middle east and norden . 
  the migrants that came to norway and finland from russia were mainly people that had lived in russia for years . 
  russia is not that keen to be a transit country and allow uncontrolled flow from the middle east to nordic countries . 
  at least this is how it seems to be at the moment . 
  they unfortunately will come if certain countries continue to deliver them free lives in european welfare state . 
  and that is the only reason they come in the first place . 
  some people seem to have serious difficulties to admit this . 
  yeah . 
  lets open direct routes to german border and sacrifice germany . 
  maybe you can then rethink whether you can or can not change your policy . 
  germany 's refugee policy can hardly be called `` humanitarian '' because it lacks any coherent strategy and is n't particularly effective way to help anyone . 
  i guess germans do it because for years they have suffered from national identity problems related to the german past . 
  this is their way to finally feel good about themselves . 
  germany has become like the crazy cat women . 
  obsessed to `` rescue '' more and more cats even though it makes more harm than the good . 
  the cats being dirty , malnutritioned and retarded because of inbreeding . 
  they are not in immediate life danger in turkey . 
  this migration to northern europe is mainly economically motivated . 
  by allowing the illegal immigration turkey makes money . 
  starting from the flight company ending to bribed border guard . 
  why would they stop it ? 
  the reality seldom corresponds to utopian day dreams . 
  but compared to the rest of the world , there may be some truth in it too . 
  the problem is that these guys obviously are here for free lunch . 
  those dont exist anywhere . 
  good idea but maybe hopelessly utopistic . 
  well , at least turkey must have accepted to take them back ... 
  why do u transport them to athens . 
  suspend all ship connections . 
  economic migrant pretending to be a refugee is a welfare fraud . 
  we have a right to protect ourselves from that . 
  if you want to give all your money to an opportunist you are free to do so but not on tax payers money thank you . 
  so greece and turkey are capable of cooperation after all ? 
  this whole phenomenon may be like a mass psychosis . 
  people let themselves to be fooled because everyone around them is doing the same . 
  but of course the whole idea to make yourself wealthy by moving to a country with good welfare benefits is completely wrong and unsustainable . 
  wealth comes from work , innovation , enterpreneurship etc. 
  not from the welfare state . 
  in a way or other the magic spell of this easy economic migration must be broken . 
  european societies can handle it up to certain point but if this goes too far our societies will break . 
  these people must find ways to improve their lives in their home countries . 
  any statistics what the unemployment rate in rinkeby is ? 
  does the swedish media ever cover the problems with these no go zones in honest way ? 
  turkey probably needs eu more than eu turkey . 
  it is nato member also . 
  but the eu leaders should have some spine in the negotiations and explain erdogan some `` hard facts '' . 
  so that he would step down from his illusions as the new sultan ... 
  hope it works . 
  i 'm just suspicious how benevolent turkey will be . 
  they clearly have their own game going on . 
  why does n't she then clearly urge greece to open the hotspots ? 
  and say that germany takes refugees but only directly from greece . 
  not from it 's borders . 
  asulym applications can be processed in the camps . 
  those who get accepted live in the city . 
  economic migrants stay in the camp until they cooperate to go back voluntarily . 
  force against the migrants . 
  when you close inner european borders and deport people to camps . 
  yes it is . 
  but at some point you probably have to use force to implement it . 
  i mean these volunteer organisations who are partially organizing this illegal immigration . 
  many of them politically motivated . 
  yes i would close those too . 
  if necessary open camps there too . 
  if greece cooperates deport them to greek island . 
  all land borders can be closed . 
  does greece have any choice ? 
  not really . 
  when they arrive greek island they need help to continue travel . 
  just turn a couple of islands into camps . 
  and provide them help voluntarily to go back when they get bored . 
  but up to this point it seems turkey just tries to scam money from eu . 
  are there any european ngo 's behind this ? 
  giving them help to organize and build equipment to destroy the fence ? 
  i wouldnt be too surprised if left leaning ngo 's were operating there and making sure the media represents the situation in `` the right way '' . 
  sacrificing part of greece is better than the whole continent . 
  border control is enforceable if u just want to . 
  and because your country is further away in the north you could cooperate with balkan countries to close their borders . 
  eu as a whole could suspend asylum right and close the borders . 
  and at the same time invest money to improve refugee camps . 
  the real refugees would get their help but doors would stay closed for opportunists . 
  but now she gives all the keys to turkey . 
  do you really believe they are not gon na use them into their own advantage ? 
   a couple of suicidal nordic countries who ? 
  where ? 
  you still need an effective method to filter the economic opportunists out . 
  they have no intention to return . 
  germany could help greece by closing borders .

  why would a military need mentally or physically incapable people ? 
  do you understand that if our world would be solely based around what people * want * to do , no one would do anything worthwhile nor any social order could be upheld ...  people should n't be forced to join the military . 
  it 's a big responsibility , and it may mean having to kill someone or die . 
  nobody should be forced to take that responsibility . 
  oh boy , you should kill people who are killing you and your people : oo how horrifying is that ?? 
  almost as horrifying as self-defense if someone is assaulting you . 
  you do n't need a military career to be able to defend your country ... 
   do you agree with indoctrination of children ? 
  obviously not to this extent ...  you do realize modern nationalism differs from late 19th century / early 20th century . 
  the nationalists of 1918 were farmer soldiers and heroes . 
  modern day nationalists are demagogues - wolves hiding among sheep , promising a mythical pagan land of wonder where everyone is pale white , talks in latvian without an accent and become erect when they hear the anthem . 
  yeah right ... 
  somehow modern nationalists are entirely different than nationalists in the past . 
  magic , right ? 
   pointing out `` if '' as its some swear word is hilarious to me . 
  latvia is more free than finland in this one simple aspect - because even if we might be fucked during an invasion , and even if it is positive for the development of young finns ( i lived in finland and talked to the locals ) , we do have the freedom of choice to participate in military , national guard and paramilitary groups . 
  your state forces you to - and you revel in it . 
  a state should not force people to participate in the military - the citizens should flock to it . 
  who gives a fuck ? 
  our nation is able to defend itself , yours is not . 
  if we 'd want total and absolute freedom , we would have an anarchy . 
  but we do n't want that . 
  we are willing to trade some of our `` freedoms '' to a secure and well-being country . 
  we are not that self-centered you know . 
  our own personal desires are not always the center of the universe . 
  what kind of a country is n't willing to even defend itself ? 
  what kind of people it inhabits ? 
  just asking ... 
   live your life , and join the military when you 're of age if you want to . 
  yeah , live your life happily in a bubble , no war will ever break out , join the military * if * you specifically want to . 
  and then the war breaks out and your people are catching fucking butterflies . 
  gg :d do you know that your country would n't even exist without nationalism ? 
  they just did , and now they 're in power :d, 
   time to emigrate . 
  again . 
  and thanks to attitudes like this , countries * need * patriotic leadership . 
  do you know what fascism is ? 
  at least 20 % of austrians disagree , 
  please , that 's just stupid ... 
  it 's like saying leftists support communism because they are on the left . 
  more like the times when women were allowed to be called `` women '' without assuming their gender and so on ... 
  i know it 's pretty far-fetched at this point , but how long would it be that way if there was no conservative attitudes in the west ? 
  i 've never heard `` family values '' used as a homophobic thing ... 
  his left hand looks like it 's from a cartoon ... 
  sweden did have a fairly decent and self-sufficient military back in the day . 
  it 's not like they had won a total war against germany , but they most certainly would have caused great casualties . 
  only the jews count ? 
  because equating racism to dictatorship is the pinnacle of intelligence , right ? 
  so does supporting the left . 
  why ? 
  i do n't know , stalin ? 
  and that makes him a prick ? 
  lol, 
  ah , typical leftists  ), 
  why is he a prick ? 
  sounds pretty logical to me . 
  here in finland , people who earn like 2500 $ a month and still live on rent often consider themselves `` middle-class '' . 
  but while american middle-class must have enough cash to pay for education and healthcare and all that shit , finns have it guaranteed already . 
  almost as cringy as german guilt over things that happened 80 years ago . 
  two wrongs does n't make it right . 
  that 's why we are not allied with russia or nato . 
  yeah , you better be sorry !, 
   [ translation in the comments ] no translation in comments ... 
  no , but i remember how they helped destroying libya . 
  well , our government is planning to cut one billion from our education and our country is less than 10 % of france by population ... 
  this would be funny if people would n't whine about the chilly summers 24/7 ... 
  without world wars , we would n't probably have eu and would still constantly compete with each other . 
  wwi and wwii worked as a certain wake up call . 
  not even the plague wants to visit poland : dd, 
  the only good thing about tourism is the boost for economy . 
  otherwise it 's nothing but destruction of culture and environment . 
  til that serbians , nazis , bolsheviks , tamil tigers and los zetas are all just like isis . 
  i do n't know why . 
  why ? 
  un operations in balkans were a total disaster ... 
  i have a book about finnish peacekeeping operations all around the world and they said they were not even allowed to return fire if they were shot at by a sniper the balkans . 
  `` just like isis '' except different from every other aspect than genocide ... 
  it 's interesting how much poland geographically moved to west after wwii . 
   what does turkey and russia have anything to do with this ? 
  they suppress/jail/kill protesters as well . 
  i 'm not defending their quality , but if someone is happy with his gifted shitty headphones , i do n't mind . 
  is russia communist ? 
  i 'd be happy if i got free decent headphones ... 
  but instead of looking cool and dangerous with all those runes and skulls , they look weak and stupid . 
  but us is 3rd world . 
   how the fuck ca n't you care about the soundquality of your headphones ? 
  it also completely invalidates your opinion on headphones in general . 
  not everyone is an audiophile ... 
  surprise surprise , 3rd world country is a 3rd world country . 
  there 's no trash in the tuska because all of it is on the stage  ), 
  who the fuck said anything about coal plants ? 
  are you a bit dull or what ? 
   dark ages could never happen today . 
  we are a global society and when stuff is discovered in china it 's easily learned in uruguay . 
  and then it just happens and nobody saw it coming ( except maybe / r/collapse ) ? 
  one big energy crisis and some unexpected environmental disaster and we are fucked . 
  our complex infrastructure would wither in front of our very eyes . 
  stuff would become scarce . 
  you could n't rely on electricity anymore ... a new dark age is completely plausible . 
  if it has happened once , there 's no reason to believe it could n't happen again .

  it 's the job of those harmed by his actions to attach cost to them , that would make it detrimental for him to leave , and instead make it preferable for him to stay and build up his own country instead . 
  just as we have done throughout our history . 
  understand that i 'm not against personal desire to want a better life . 
  i 'm against enabling of those desires in a way that is destructive to both societies he leaves and one he parasitises . 
  a cost needs to be attached to such actions to dissuade them to significant extent . 
  and if you think that macedonia is badly off , we have several places in africa where this kind of migration condemns hundreds of millions of people to abject misery . 
  their states can never improve because after spending significant effort bringing the children up , they do n't stay and build up the country and help to raise the next generation . 
  instead they pack up and leave hoping for better life elsewhere , because that 's just easier to do on a personal level . 
   or i walk . 
  this option is the problem . 
  modern people tend to walk away at the slightest sign of discomfort to themselves . 
  marriages , countries , even their own children . 
  with disastrous results for the society . 
  and in the end , overwhelming majority is worse off for it . 
  fact is , extreme freedom of movement in its current form is a very recent thing , and is proving to be extremely destructive because of reasons outlined above . 
  and no , if you were n't given an option to easily leave , you would have found a way to earn a living . 
  it would have been less comfortable , certainly . 
  but in process , the state and its people on average would have been better off . 
  and someone would have been trained in your place in us to be a skilled worker . 
  so net positive there as well , as long as you look from the point of view of the society , rather than the rich , who got to enjoy a cheaper worker who is n't as demanding and drives the quality of life for locals down . 
  this relationship is parasitic in nature , not symbiotic as you seem to suggest . 
  all relevant parties are worse for it but the parasite . 
  by definition , that is parasitism . 
  this is a huge problem , that has a lot to do with ideal of free movement of people . 
  young do n't stay in their countries fixing them if something is broken . 
  instead they take the path of least resistance and go somewhere where things are fine . 
  that is extremely destructive on societal level . 
  country of origin gets worse because there are n't enough people to correct the problems . 
  country where they go gets worse because of influx of underpaid gastarbeiters who lower quality of living for working class in the country and effectively parasitise and slowly drain resources from their middle class . 
  which eventually results in country becoming yet another broken state . 
  this process can only end with all decent states eventually succumbing , or freedom of movement being curtailed to an extent . 
  it is . 
  most people in the state are muslims , and fully support islamist theocratic government , that is democratically elected as they are indeed in a majority . 
  islamic theocracy is not in direct conflict with democracy if majority of people are muslims who support it . 
  it 's in direct conflict with human rights , which is a completely different topic . 
  indeed . 
  if they lose , and it seems likely that they will as every mullah is screaming for akp supporters to come onto the streets and stop the coup from their minarets , this is going to be the swan song of secularism in turkey . 
  looks like erdogan did n't disempower army enough , and they are going to try to perform their key role in turkey as envisioned by kemal ataturk . 
  that is , prevent islamists from grabbing power and bringing in islamic theocracy over secular republic . 
  it 's going to be interesting to see if it 's too late , or if they can still get the job done . 
  it 's undemocratic as heck , but from european point of view , they 're the ones fighting against the darkness that is a savage islamic theocracy supported by majority of population . 
  i merely pointed out the lie in your supposed debunking of my point . 
  nothing more , nothing less . 
  rapid back pedalling from your point that you engage in above is quite telling about the fact that you knew to have been lying . 
  the fact that you clearly can not comprehend the difference between `` fact '' and `` your opinion '' is fairly obvious from your last post as well . 
  another point of confusion you share with aforementioned uk youths . 
  i do n't quite understand your complaint . 
  we had no one recognise our independence until russia recognised it . 
  that 's modus operandi for becoming independent . 
  most want the one you get independent from to recognise you first to avoid diplomatic problems . 
  as for the rest , we 're been there with you . 
  it 's not that you ca n't understand the point . 
  it 's that you pointedly do n't want to . 
  i would argue that he was wildly successful . 
  he got a lot of people to believe his lies , and was instrumental in turning the situation in europe to be as explosive as it is today . 
  i happen to know about kharkiv , as that 's where the daughter company of my relative 's workplace is . 
  so yes , there were rapings and killings . 
  in fact , they ran the kiev 's stooge and his paramilitary rapists out of town for just those actions twice or thrice . 
  see , when nationalistic young men overthrow a government , they start seeing where ever they 're told to go as their own private fiefdom . 
  that 's universal , and an element into which all military forces run into . 
  in case of being just after the overthrow , and getting put into the region where people who 's president you just overthrow massive voted for said president , you 're going to have a good motivation to get some more reckoning . 
  and with young men with guns , reckoning usually comes in form of raping and killing . 
  again , not something limited to that specific country . 
  you see it in the most disciplined armies of today , such as us invasion of iraq and afghanistan , with infamous leaks of covered up cases of soldiers breaking in , grabbing the teenaged girl and raping her while her family is kept at gunpoint . 
  after an overthrow , with rag tag paramilitaries who did the overthrowing , and who now get to rule over the ideological enemies who voted said president in power ? 
  you 're going to see a wave of that . 
  surely even someone as propagandised as yourself can not deny this ? 
  in the end he came with apcs and basically turned his residence in a fortress . 
  so locals could n't toss his bandits out any more . 
  ca n't fight armoured autocannon platforms with just small arms . 
  it was a cause of significant disappointment for the locals that they simply were n't prepared for it . 
   not to mention that finlandization is particularly despised among estonians . 
  and yet , you surrendered far more sovereignty than we ever had , and to an empire far away . 
  reminder : sovereignty in eyes of internal law is the sole right apply and use force within specific borders . 
  as you still do not `` despise '' your own policy over this , and yet `` despise '' far lesser concessions simply based on racist criteria , it shows a significant amount of hypocrisy . 
  that is quite an extreme interpretation , specifically designed to limit amount of people allowed to read the quran . 
  it reminds me of `` well they drank alcohol , therefore they are not muslims '' argument often used of islamist terrorists . 
  accurate translations have existed for a very long time . 
  this is where parallel to bible is accurate . 
  it 's true that the only `` true '' bible is in latin , as canonisation was done in that language . 
  but accurate translations exist and bible can be read literally from those just as well . 
  same applies to all holy texts . 
  notably , quran is just one of the three foundational texts of islam . 
  other two being the hadiths ( the commandments of the prophet ) and the sunnah ( the story of muhammad 's life that every muslim man must aspire to emulate to his best ability ) . 
  it 's the two latter ones that are actually the worst - much of ideology of jihad for example is straight out of sunnah , how muhammad waged his wars against unbelievers , and requirements of muslim men to emulate him . 
  all of these have been accurately translated to major languages , and are easily available . 
  then we 'll talk after you outgrow that phase . 
  clearly whatever it is you read is not material provided behind the link . 
  link clearly stated that his main sin was n't `` providing support '' but lying about facts on the ground to everyone , including the public , even in the face of nation leaders who already knew him to be lying . 
  and then consistently ignoring their warnings , and conspiring against his own commander in chief . 
   stop telling me irrelevant shit about anatolia those who do not learn from history are doomed to repeat it . 
  regressivism has a specific definition - regressing into past state . 
  the fact that we are sliding back to early iron age religion 's ideas of society , such as lower human value of women than men , violent anti-semitism that is coming from islam , challenges to freedom of speech , acceptance of extreme violence of its religious tenets ( i.e. 
  `` we ca n't call it islam , lest we radicalise other muslims '' movement ) . 
  all of these ideas radiate from islam and it 's apologists , and all are inherently regressive . 
  they regress our progress as society . 
  as you clearly tell me that you should not be told about the past , because it 's in your own words `` irrelevant shit '' . 
  there is no greater demonstration of just how regressive you are . 
  you literally do not want to hear specific historic examples , because they would shatter your self image , and force you to admit to your own ideological regressivism . 
  that is the angle peddled by the said apostate mullahs .

  i 've done quite a bit of winter bicycling and the difference is really drastic . 
  does n't feel so good idea when you get fined by the police . 
  nah , it was a light hearted jab . 
  but seriously , there are many ways you can define western europe and eastern europe . 
  nato / warsaw pact is the most widely used but that divide makes only sense in our narrow time frame . 
  that 's exactly what a jealous eastern european would say . 
  ilya repin is pretty amazing . 
  alexander the second was a pretty cool dude though . 
  easily the most benign foreign monarch we ever had and the one to free the russian serfs as well . 
  poles would of course disagree because of his violent suppression of the january uprising . 
  a target list from late seventies or early eighties would be even more chilling . 
  nuclear stockpiles were much larger and both countries had more missiles . 
  we were n't . 
  saying otherwise is belittling what estonia for example went through . 
  they were a part of ussr and gdr , hungary , poland etc. 
  were satellite states . 
  it takes pretty special mental gymnastics to think we were on the same boat . 
  old volvos yes but there 's nothing special about the new ones . 
  what kind of bidets ? 
  here we have [ these ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ad/bidee_shower.jpg/220px-bidee_shower.jpg ) at almost every bathroom . 
  he 's not bj\u00f6rling but that was nice anyway . 
  ah , thanks . 
  the meanings are sometimes confusing . 
  it depends . 
  in british english i think it 's called marmalade . 
  you are right . 
  there are a lot of high rise suburbs in many parts of europe because of the heavy urbanization and baby boomer generations after the war . 
  there were n't enough apartments in city centers to house everyone and building planned suburbs was deemed to be the most efficient way of addressing that . 
  one consideration is the usage of land . 
  in usa there 's a lot of land so your suburbs look more like [ this ] ( http://www.houstonhomeandcondo.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/houston-subdivision.jpg ) . 
  the definition also means cultural differences . 
  we never were a part or a satellite of the soviet union . 
  a udinese and juventus striker who was a regular in the national team is bound to be famous . 
  what a sad specimen of a joulutorttu . 
  it 's burned and has too much marmelade . 
  what about gravlax ? 
  here it 's among the most important dishes . 
  the project seems to be more about economy than military . 
  basically a job-creating program which at the same time maintains the ability to produce indigenous combat aircraft . 
  basically all germanic and finno-ugric languages , russian and sanskrit . 
  there are probably many more . 
  czechoslovakia was really of the charts . 
   unfortunately , the methods of delivery are ever-improvable . 
  i do n't think it 's necessarily a bad thing . 
  effective delivery methods are one reason why using nuclear weapons in anger would be incredibly stupid . 
  you ca n't defend against icbm 's carrying 10 mirv 's . 
  anyone who starts a nuclear war will be obliterated . 
  before advanced icbm 's the concept of first strike was more appealing because with luck and good planning you could have delivered a decapitating first blow , at least nearly so . 
  but what about taffel ? 
  some of the flights are designed to gather intelligence . 
  they want to know how our air force responds in different situations and how fast the intrusions are detected . 
  there are also sigint planes involved to intercept radio traffic . 
  no doubt some of the violations have been accidental but the problem is there are no repercussions from any of them . 
  they can afford sloppy navigation because the worst thing that can happen is a strongly worded letter to the ambassador . 
   if anybody is trying to invade my home , i 'm sorry but i 'm going to aim center mass , pull the trigger and i 'm not stopping until he 's not moving or the gun goes `` click '' . 
  you do that in finland and you 'll most likely go to jail . 
  using deadly force is only allowed if yours or another persons life is in immediate danger . 
  the point is that finland is so safe that the whole matter is almost irrelevant here . 
  i 've never heard someone proposing allowing gun permits for self-defence . 
  it 's not a matter of ideology and constitution like in the states . 
  in switzerland you have to get a permit for open carry but i 've read they are quite rare . 
  however you can transport the weapon openly when you are going to range or back to home from there , naturally unloaded . 
  getting a permit for self-defence is extremely hard because you have to prove your life is threatened . 
  you have to understand that fantasies about protecting your home with firearms is an uniquely american thing . 
  shooting people in civilized western european countries is really rare . 
  really ? 
  they have a large reservist force just like us . 
  i 've never heard anyone saying that . 
  it concerns hunters as well . 
  many of them own and use semi automatic rifles . 
   my only recourse is to call the police and hope they will arrive on time before somebody has forced his way in ? 
  so the only choices are to shoot the intruder or call the police ? 
  there are other means to defend yourself . 
  it 's a slippery slope . 
  if normal people arm themselves criminals have to do so as well . 
  besides finland is a very safe country with strong national cohesion . 
  guns are treated as tools and sports equipment here , not weapons for self-defence . 
  i 've managed to cut my consumption to 2-3 portions a day . 
  i actually like it better this way . 
  til . 
  i wonder if the border is even marked up there . 
   and practically arctic . 
  not arctic enough for norweigians . 
  they come to oulu to have beach vacations . 
  switzerland 's system is a mix of representative and direct democracies . 
  false . 
  parole hearings begin every other year after 12 years in prison but in theory you could remain behind bars indefinitely . 
  in practice the maximum is about 20 years . 
  if the prisoner is still deemed dangerous after that he/she will be a subject to involuntary psychical treatment for as long as necessary . 
  i 'm actually slightly worried about icbm defence systems . 
  if mad is n't a certainty the threshold for using nuclear weapons becomes lower . 
  this is 2015 , not 1985 . 
  russia has no political influence in finland any more . 
  that does n't mean we do n't have to consider their existence though . 
  having an untrustworthy and bellicose nuclear power as a neighbour is tricky but so far we have managed decently . 
  in fact the government is currently reworking the aforesaid law . 
  it prevented us from helping sweden with the submarine hunt which was a real shame . 
  unlike you we are neutral . 
  actually the current law forbids us to take military action abroad aside from peacekeeping operations . 
  joining the nato is the only way to guarantee help .

  and no one is excusing arab terror groups , i 'm simply explaining their existence and putting them into their historical context . 
  it is this article and all its fanboys who are insisting on a binary `` europe not to blame only arabs to blame '' while being careful not to actually discuss any single conflict or issue . 
  lol of course i 've heard of the ottoman empire , but it seems that that 's * all * you 've heard of . 
  the modern conflicts were not caused by the ottomans because the ottoman system was decentralized local role in a wider federation . 
  the policy was called `` several nations , one state '' , and in arabic * ittihad al-ansar la tawhiduha '' * ( a federated , rather than an assimilationist , unity among the empire 's elements . ), 
  in fact , the arab revolt of 1916 was caused precisely by ottoman attempts to centralize the state and turkify non turkish parts of the empire . 
  right before the collapse of the empire , the cup party mandated that arabic must be taught in arab regions by turkish teachers , and that lawsuits must be held in turkish . 
  these were some of the most hated policies in arab regions . 
  having said all that , the creation of saudi arabia , the statelets of kuwait , qatar , uae , the partitioning of syria and lebanon and israel , the neglect of the kurds - these are all british and french ventures . 
  what 's your source ? 
  i do n't think this is true at all post-nasser . 
  he removed any references to islam from the constitution and established a free public school system and a campaign to reduce illiteracy . 
  the vast majority of egyptians went to state schools that were more nationalistic than anything else . 
  of course , many parents took their children out of schools to work , and illiteracy has steadily risen since sadat , but education was definitely not provided by mosques and churches in lieu of state schooling . 
  look you obviously do n't know what you 're talking about and have to resort to this muslim lands lebensraum nonsense . 
  as i explained to someone else just now : the palestinians rejected the state proposed by the u.n. because the proposed jewish state would be larger than the palestinian state and would have a 45 % minority of palestinians . 
  the proposed palestinian state was smaller and would 've been 99 % palestinian . 
  what 's more , a majority of the land in the proposed jewish state was owned by palestinians . 
  so why on earth would the 45 % minority accept that ?? 
  secondly , the arab states only interfered in the conflict in may 1948 , after 300,000 palestinians had been ethnically cleansed and widespread news of massacres by zionist forces . 
  this is all well documented and you can read about it by picking up any mainstream israeli history book on the issue , by benny morris , avi shlaim , ilan pappe , zeev maoz , etc. 
  what you 're saying is directly contradicted by the government of britain itself . 
  the british government established a committee in 1939 to investigate its actions in palestine , and concluded : `` in the opinion of the committee it is , however , evident from these statements that ** his majesty 's government were not free to dispose of palestine without regard for the wishes and interests of the inhabitants of palestine ** ... '' britain created israel by drafting the balfour declaration and then actively supporting the creation of a jewish state in palestine , which was finally implemented in 1947 by the u.n. arthur balfour , who originally pledged the british government to the zionist project , clearly shows his disregard : `` and zionism , be it right or wrong , good or bad , is rooted in age-long traditions , in present needs , in future hopes , of far greater import than the desires and prejudices of the 700,000 arabs who now inhabit that ancient land . '', 
  also , ben-gurion 's memoirs state that israel was the first to start the war . 
  and finally , the palestinians rejected the state proposed by the u.n. because the proposed jewish state would be larger than the palestinian state and have a 45 % minority of palestinians . 
  the proposed palestinian state was smaller and would 've been 99 % palestinian . 
  what 's more , a majority of the land in the proposed jewish state was owned by palestinians . 
  why on earth would the 45 % minority accept that ? 
  * watch this video by & lt ; insert hate preacher with no qualifications here  explaining why these ancient hateful europeans have been at war ever since the romans !, 
  what conflicts in the middle east are caused by the treatment of women and gays ? 
  or has this conversation descended now to `` everything is not europe 's fault therefore nothing is '' ? 
  europe did n't cause my car crash either . 
  it * did * cause many on-going conflicts in the middle east and africa and asia . 
  hahaha wow many logics !, 
  so you 're saying that britain creating israel as a jewish homeland in palestine was not causal to the conflict ? 
  or france 's creation of a christian homeland was not causal to the lebanese civil war ? 
  or britain 's military and monetary support of the al-saud family totally unconnected from the al-saud conquering arabia with a mercenary army ? 
  no you 're right , no connection whatsoever !, 
  hahah so how is anatolia any more violent than europe was in the last 100 years ? 
  they 're incomparable . 
  it 's factual to point out that europeans killed 100-200 million people in ww1 and ww2 , and then they like to discuss how everyone else is so violent . 
  totally b.s. 
  you mean peaceful like serbia ? 
  montenegro ? 
  albania ? 
  or europe in the 1930s and 40s ? 
  anatolia is and has always been more peaceful than europe . 
  europe becomes peaceful for like 10 years and all of a sudden everyone forgets that the largest killing in human history has taken place in europe . 
  what ethnic groups ? 
  people like you who obviously do n't know modern middle eastern history like to throw out these sorts of empty cliches , like that there are many ethnic groups battling each other forever . 
  it 's an obvious fact that many conflicts would 've been avoided if european colonial powers had not messed things up , like the israeli-palestinian conflict , the kurdish conflict , the creation of saudi arabia , invasion of kuwait , etc etc. 
  most of these have nothing to do with ethnicity . 
  and i already said that there might have been other conflicts . 
  we just ca n't know what they were because most of these conflicts are very obviously a direct result of european state building projects . 
  haha it 's obvious that the one and only thing you know about the middle east is that there see shias and sunnis . 
  and yes , of course shias are killing sunnis literally everywhere in the middle east . 
  good job . 
  it 's a fact that the us tried to squash communism in the region by supporting far right islamist regimes . 
  those regimes supported jihadists and spread jihadi ideology that the us is now battling in iraq and syria . 
  do the minimum and at least read the wikipedia pages on these countries . 
  egypt , syria , and iraq have been secular states since the 1950s and earlier . 
  and fyi - they 're not killing each other because of religion , they 're killing each other to see which group gets control , and because there are no strong national identities in the middle east that would supersede religious identities . 
  this article is totally devoid of information or historical context . 
  the brutal regimes and radical islam are a direct consequence of the colonial regimes . 
  it 's highly unlikely that ibn saud would 've conquered the territory of arabia had britain not paid him 100,000 pounds a year for several years so that he could pay for a mercenary army . 
  had they not done this , the far more liberal hashemites would 've spread their own brand of islam . 
  and had the european powers not created israel , the israeli-palestinian conflict would n't have happened . 
  had there been different borders , the kurdish separatist movement would n't have developed or saddam 's violence against them . 
  different borders would also have avoided the iraqi invasion of kuwait and the following american interventions into iraq . 
  we can also thank france for creation of lebanon as a christian homeland and the resulting lebanese civil war . 
  so `` sykes-picot '' as a shorthand for the colonial creation of arab states is definitely the cause of most arab problems and wars today . 
  this is n't to say that we would n't have had conflicts or wars without the colonial period , but we ca n't say what those would have been . 
  the reality is that we did have colonialism , and most of our serious problems today are a direct result of that period . 
  forgot to add the whole western sahara issue to the list of european colonial cock-ups . 
  as well as the sudanese civil war and separation of south sudan . 
  yes exactly . 
  you were saying they need secular education , and i pointed out to you that most have had secular education since the 1950s . 
  egypt and syria and iraq and turkey have all been just as secular , if not more secular than italy or several eastern european states , just as an example . 
  see the right wing christian militias in lebanon . 
  the phalange , or kataeb , perpetrated the sabra and shatila massacres . 
  you can find plenty of full on racist interviews on youtube with their leader , bachir gemayyel . 
  they modelled themselves on the nazi party in the 30s and even adopted the nazi salute . 
  lol . 
  most of the middle east is already secular . 
  egypt was secular under mubarak , tunisia under ben ali , and syria under assad , iraq under baath - all authoritarian dictators . 
  for that matter , i 've lived in finland and in the middle east , and in finland i was forced to take christianity class . 
  in the middle east ( kuwait and egypt ) i was n't forced to take any religion class . 
  this was 20 years ago , but puts things in perspective for you . 
  i guess it 's similar to golden dawn infiltrating the greek military . 
  teenaged boys playing soldiers are never the deepest thinkers . 
  this is the dumbest comment i 've seen in years . 
  are you a teenager ? 
  obesity is a health problem . 
  being brown is n't . 
  you can choose to not `` like '' anything you want , but when the government clearly makes a law targeting brown people then that is racist . 
  do n't insult our intelligence with this kind of garbage comparison . 
  that 's an ad hominem argument . 
  he likely suffers from [ cultural cringe ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/cultural_cringe ) or is just a regular idiot . 
  the statement `` descendents of non western countries '' is unequivocally racist . 
  it means it does n't matter where you 're from or how long you 've been in denmark or what your personal views are : the government sees you as a demographic threat because you are n't white .

  i would like to see it become official . 
  as we have the long border with russians , they do n't and since there is no formal alliance with sweden ... 
  ... i would n't call it teaming up but it is what it is . 
  is it the owner of the building who is removing them or somebody else without any permissions ? 
  well this brings back childhood memories , it 's not the first time swedes are submarine hunting . 
  i can not honestly guess what the hell is russia trying to accomplish with this . 
  is there a reason why some italian politicians seem to be so pro putin and russia ? 
  but the passport is standardised travel document . 
  do we really need two of them ? 
  and you are right about the yanks !, 
  if only it had been written in french too , because it 's the new official language of the eu travel documents - you know , 
  to be honest i liked the previous design of ours more , the one that \u00c5land is using , than the current one . 
  it 's too cluttered with all the text in the middle . 
   op 's design is very internationally recognizable . 
  that it may be but there are couple of reasons why i do n't like it . 
  firstly it looks too much of a travel document issued by european union to an italian person rather than a passport issued by italy , a member of eu , to one of its citizens . 
  i like it more the way it is now . 
  there are common guidelines but each country has a unique design . 
  if eu becomes a federation then yes , an identical passport is a good thing . 
  the other thing , why i do n't like it , is that it looks too merry - bright colours , that flag strip . 
  passport is an important travel document and its design should reflect it - darker colours , metallic embossing , coat of arms etc. 
  i do n't mind the current burgundy red but dark purple might have been an interesting choice . 
  a bit of royalty in your pocket - you people of foreign lands , thou shalt bow before me !, 
  well , you probably should say `` you shall bow before me '' , one does not want to become too familiar with the masses , now do you . 
  ^ ^ the ^ ^ whole ^ ^ bowing ^ ^ thing ^ ^ - ^ ^ it 's ^ ^ a ^ ^ joke . 
  because you can not use an id-card outside of the schengen area as a travel document . 
  it looks like some sort of a rallycar stripes . 
  burgundy was a compromise . 
  one of the early suggestions was lilac . 
  [ here 's an article about it ] ( http://www.economist.com/node/21548936 ) . 
  i personally prefer the embossed coat of arms of the country than the flag or the eu stars . 
  [ here are most of the current passport covers of the eu member states ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/passports_of_the_european_union#overview_of_passports_issued_by_28_member_states ) . 
  is there any change that you could have an another referendum about the voting system in the near future or was that really a once-in-a-generation opportunity as mr. firth said at the time ? 
  was there actual study that a change in voting system would cost 250 million pounds ? 
  that sum does n't sound plausible . 
  what !? 
  what do you have against the children might i ask ?!, 
  yes , it was terrible ad that had really nothing to do with the question in the referendum . 
  that was hilarious and sad at the same time . 
  i 've always thought that british politicians are great orators - not all of them i see . 
  well was n't that a lovely ad that had nothing to do with the referendum . 
  what happened 1982 ? 
  there is a sudden spike in liberal 's popularity . 
  also , i 've read that you had a referendum about your voting system and people decided to keep current first past the post one by quite big margin 70 to 30 percents or something close to that ( if i remember correctly ) . 
  why did n't people want the change ? 
   miliband is so awful what 's wrong with him ? 
  why is he awful ? 
  i 've read elsewhere that people do n't like him but there has n't been any explanation why he is so disliked . 
  indeed !, 
  i do n't think that he meant it literally but as a metaphor how the world changed and nokia with our paper industry were caught off guard . 
  i 'm curious , is the king of belgians fluent in all official languages of belgium ? 
  does he have to be ? 
  reason why i was wondering it is that i 've heard that the king is one of the unifying factors in belgium ( do n't know if that is true or not ) . 
  unfortunately a lie repeated enough times becomes the truth if unchallenged . 
  you can always buy [ a micro apartement ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4foar8i26g ) . 
  intet problem !, 
  and i blame google translator for any mistakes . 
  apparently the swedish idioms i 've learned do n't translate properly to danish like : f\u00f6r all del. 
  :d at least you tried !, 
  i could offer couple of comebacks but they are old ones and not really that funny anymore . 
  for the future , if you do n't mind , do n't use triple or quadruple vowels when writing faux finnish if you wish it to look more authentic . 
  how kind, 
  as i do n't follow sports in general and i 'm not initiated to the minutiae of the football so i do find it a bit boring . 
  i can understand why handball is more fun to watch . 
  okei , i was just curious . 
  in finland you did ' t have to have a surname until 1921 when we had our first law about surnames and until 1929 woman did n't have to take her husband 's surname ( before some took but not all - different traditions in different parts of country ) . 
  in 1987 law was changed and now women do n't have to take their husband 's name . 
  same sex couples not to be able to take common name when registering their partnership was a way to appease traditionalists and religious folk and to have some legal difference between marriage and registered partnership . 
  not be able to file a joint adoption is the other one , as / u/molehole pointed out . 
  irony of course is that our current , what people perceive as traditional , surname convention is n't that old - or traditional . 
   it feels weird to read . 
  because you did n't expect to read such a thing in a novel written 86 years ago or because the way it was written ? 
   finns like to get shitfaced and kill people . 
  people whom they have been getting shitfaced with and probably in a group of alcoholics and persons who are marginalised in society . 
  just to clarifyi , a bit . 
  lazy you say ? 
  i would n't call you lazy after this post .

   i frowned upon the twelve naked boys as did the people of tampere , in 1906 .

  is the water company going to install water meters and people are afraid that this will result water becoming more expensive ? 
  we have them and one of my childhood memories is parents shouting : close the tap , do n't run the water if you are not using it - happy times :d, 
  you can read it [ here ] ( http://yle.fi/uutiset/7523572 ) .

  we had a proper beach smoke sauna rented , pushed it to ~ 125c , covered the meter and let them in with drinks . 
  they freaked when we took the cover off the meter :d, 
  indeed . 
  i 've had quite a few friends who moved out of main cities because price of property outside main hubs is going down . 
  but that carries a downside , as economic development process is about urbanisation , so it 's pretty much `` be in one of the  100k cities , or lose money by buying your house '' . 
  which is the point i was making . 
  to be able to afford lifestyle like this outside the main large cities requires a very good job , of which there are fewer and fewer outside the main urban centres , or ownership of a successful small business . 
  that is not something average person can reach in their 30s . 
  for most , that level of comfort comes a couple of decades later . 
  at one point in turkey 's history , it was overwhelmingly christian . 
  this romanticised version of ottoman invasion and islamic world in general is getting tiresome . 
  they were the key players in properly industrialized slavery , and the key players in institutionalizing systemic slave raiding , systemic child theft and forced conversions . 
  most people who had to live under them hates them to this day for those atrocities . 
  because there 's a limit to what you can do in a single war . 
  even if you go above and beyond . 
  ottomans on the other hand were brutal over hundreds of years , and not because individual ruler was particularly bad , but because the system in the state was aimed to produce that level of brutality . 
  vlad the impaler died and those that came after him were n't nearly as brutal as he . 
  ottoman empire persisted through centuries , and was brutal throughout its history . 
  i did n't say anything of the sort . 
  my point was that both costs of living and salaries that far out of main growth regions are lower . 
  in larger cities , certainly . 
  in smaller ones , not so much . 
  both cost of living and salaries in smaller cities are notably lower . 
  also known as parenting :d . that 's at least half of it . 
  probably more . 
  it gets better when they grow a bit . 
  many of the residential saunas are actually pretty weak , but most people do n't really expect a proper smoke sauna experience from them either . 
  in a proper smoke sauna , you can easily push to 110c . 
  now that is a good experience . 
  he 's pretty much an upper class , as he 's a company owner . 
  most people around here are middle class , and a whole lot less wealthy . 
  they can reach the same wealth level , but when they are ten to twenty years older , provided they do n't get divorced or go stupid on spending instead of saving . 
  overall , it 's a good country if you have your stuff together like op does . 
  but probably not quite as well off . 
  considering that you just called ottoman turks from 600 years ago `` nomadic '' in a discussion about historic facts from that age , we 're done talking . 
  someone with that much ignorance about relevant historic facts is n't worth talking with . 
  if you wish to continue with this discourse , i recommend reading up on relevant history period so that you have some basis for arguments . 
  of course , that would likely make you comprehend that your initial claim is in fact that of false equivalence , and that i 'm correct in quoting historic facts as the reason . 
  false equivalence . 
  ottoman invasion was exceptionally bloody and brutal . 
  i 'm talking about concrete historic facts , not generalist platitudes . 
  historic reasons . 
  last time turks was allowed in europe , they raped their way to vienna over hundreds of years . 
  of course it is . 
  in a meme-filled head of a sad and simple person that sees the world in black and white . 
  actually this is likely a wrong thing to do . 
  right thing to do would be to infiltrate those sites , locate , track and monitor those who use them to glorify terrorism , and then go after them . 
  these sites are a symptom of islamism . 
  security apparatus needs to treat the cancer itself , not the cough it produces . 
  hitler only took about 20 % of total votes to get in power . 
  this argument of `` this many did n't vote '' has no relevance whatsoever on person 's power . 
  it 's the ability to get enough votes to enact political machinations to get significant political power within the government that matters . 
  your argument is completely comparable to argument of liberals in germany in early 1930s . 
   i 'm not arguing in bad faith at all , russian officers are proven liars i like how you manage to successfully contradict yourself so quickly . 
  you are utterly ignorant of history if you think that your forefathers `` gave us a regiment '' . 
  they did n't . 
  volunteers came on their own . 
  as for `` loyalty '' , the biggest atrocity in finnish history to day is known as `` isoviha '' . 
  that translates to `` big hate '' . 
  that 's when russians took vengeance on finns for swedish actions of mass slavery and mass murder of russians in decades prior . 
  swedes obviously hid behind us , as they always did and did n't suffer the brunt of consequences for their atrocities at the time . 
  so it 's not about `` alliance '' . 
  it 's about you hiding behind us , knowing we 'll take care of the problem , while doing little to nothing to help . 
  which continues to this day , with your running down of your military in last few decades , knowing that we have universal conscription among males and voluntary among females , so as usual , we 'll hold the front . 
  even through your mass media screams about evil russians . 
  guess who they have to come through to get to you ? 
  yeah . 
  your attitude is demonstrative on why i 'm insisting in paying my respects to volunteers and their support structure , and not mainstream people such as yourself . 
  under the thin veneer of supposed sympathy , there runs a deep feeling of smug superiority and blatant racism towards your eastern neighbours . 
  after all , we 're just your former colony , to be raped and crusaded at your will , and to lay down our lives to defend you . 
  and if a few of your countrymen see your actions as deplorable and come to help , well , you 'll just appropriate their accomplishments as your own . 
  i have never in my entire life voted right wing . 
  i 'm staunchly socialist and liberal . 
  i 'm in my thirties . 
  your desperate character assassination attempts are demonstrative of your lack of arguments on topic . 
  overwhelmingly so . 
  sweden made a huge point of staying neutral in the conflict , and all the help , as little of it as came was very much against the mainstream which dictated neutrality and not intervening in the conflict . 
  that 's why i raise my hat to the volunteers and most certainly not the swedish government and mainstream society , which continues to view finland as an expendable safety buffer against russia . 
  if you wish , i can cite you massive body of historic evidence of this , that starts back with swedish crusades into finland as it made a territorial grab when muscovite russia was weakened by mongol-tatar yoke and has n't ended to this date . 
  really now ? 
  assaulting and defending recently taken positions is not useful for invading ? 
  who is the tactician/strategist you can reference to support this utterly idiotic claim ? 
  this does n't even address the fact that russians have the exact same claim , on the exact same merits , which suggests that you do understand this fact and are arguing in bad faith . 
  extrapolation is meaningless only if practised on single case scenarios . 
  in this case , it 's done as a statistical analysis to the existing long running trend . 
  in fact , that 's the entire point of the said comic . 
  you ca n't do much with a single observation . 
  you need many statistical points to draw conclusions . 
  which we have in this case . 
  if you think i 'm wrong , feel free to hit the books . 
  or even fire off an email to randall munroe . 
  if he has time , he 'll likely be nice enough to explain to you why you are massively misrepresenting his position , turning his entire argument on its head in your ignorance . 
  most hilariously of all , you are actually guilty of the very thing you imply cerlic is guilty of . 
  extrapolation from a single point of data . 
  you are suggesting that just because extrapolation from single point of data is incorrect , all extrapolation is incorrect . 
  are you seriously suggesting that the massive bounce of militant islam across caucasus just occurred because `` saudis travelled there '' ? 
  hint : a few outisiders who try to preach aggressive , militant and violent theology get thrown out or arrested in places that are the way you suggest . 
  it was n't . 
  us intelligence correctly identified islam as excellent tool of state subversion , and ussr had to spend enormous amount of resources keeping a lid on it . 
  they mostly disarmed it to the point where today , if you want to see majority populations of muslims who have at least some kind of meaningful support for western liberal values , you 'll only find them in cis countries .

  so it is first going for a cup of coffee and some salty , then to art museum which after dinner and later few drinks in a small and moody intimate bar . 
  most european nations in the last century have lost more land and have had to relocate more people than in israel-arab conflict . 
  by the way , south is not the only `` chilled out '' place . 
  finland resembles germany in `` efficient '' culture , but thanks to having more pragmatism orientated culture is much more flexible than many other countries that are in my opinion quite rigid . 
  southern europe fails if it does n't embrace market capitalism . 
  other parts in europe have experienced similar or even worse hardships and they have moved on and become successful again by embracing capitalism . 
  first of all canada is not situated in europe , that is a major hurdle . 
  opening up membership for countries not situated in europe would open up doors for all third world countries to apply membership , and denying them membership negotiation when canada was taken as member would lead to call for racism . 
  not going to happen . 
  secondly canada joining the eu would lead to escalation of relationship with the usa . 
  us has stated publicly that it is and will be unchallenged military power . 
  eu is already seen as potential challenger of us hegemony in washington and canada/quebec joining it would be a slap on the face as the western hemisphere belongs to us area of influence . 
  in case of norway/switzerland option , this could be workable , but canada would need to first get the fta pact done . 
  [ risto ryti ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/risto_ryti ) was the fifth president of finland , from 1940 to 1944 . 
  ryti started his career as a politician in the field of economics and as a political background figure during the interwar period . 
  he made a wide range of international contacts in the world of banking and within the framework of the league of nations . 
  ryti served as prime minister during the winter war and the interim peace . 
  later he served as president during the continuation war . 
  after the war , ryti was the main defendant in the finnish war-responsibility trials . 
  and after greece there are ireland and portugal , and after them there are spain and italy ... are you going to just shrug your shoulders and say that if we ca n't handle them then we should just disband altogether ? 
  how about germany , if germany would be in trouble , who could pay that ? 
  the fact of the matter that throwing money away is a never ending path that leads only to more and more money being burned . 
  in case of agricultural subsidies , yes they are expensive and should be canceled , but guess what , that money belongs to european taxpayers , not to states . 
  as a european taxpayer , i have to say i 'm not ready to see not a single euro going more to states , what european states need to do is to tear down themselves if they do n't have financial base to support them . 
   troika covers all social spending that is crazy expensive . 
   eu can pay off greeces debt easily , just cut agricultural subsidies , especially for sugar and meat again , expensive !, 
  what you are saying is that there should be huge transfer of wealth from well doing eu countries to less well doing states . 
  the problem with this is that there is no logical end to it . 
  there would have been no revolution that riot police could n't have handled . 
  it is better to adjust now than to wait until the situation is so bad that even more drastic measures are need in order to save the economy . 
  they should have cut so much that instead of increasing taxes , they could have lowered them . 
  that would have satisfied markets . 
  if the finances of country are in trouble then what the state needs to do is to cut down bureaucracy and privatize state functions . 
  do remember that taxes do n't generate new value , value is generated by the private sector , not by the state . 
  the eu commission has given blind eye to sweden in regards of joining the eurozone as when sweden joined the eu , eurozone was n't still formed and not all details were solved . 
  however when old eastern block countries joined the eu , eurozone had already been created and was functioning . 
  after the current crisis is over i have no doubt that the commission will take a hard-line against countries not fulfilling their treaty obligations . 
  ukraine and belarus produce both commodities and goods that compete with each others . 
  when eu and ukraine will ratify accession agreement , ukrainian exports to eu will have lower import tariff than belarus , this means that ukrainian products either become cheaper or ukrainian manufacturers get bigger margin . 
  either way exporters in belarus will either loose markets or have to settle for lower margins . 
  the eu accession treaty already obligates poland to join the euro as soon as it full-fills criteria to join . 
  the decision was made long ago , it is now for poland to make good up on the promises made in the accession treaty . 
  signing / ratifying association agreement with ukraine will hurt economy of belarus and moldova as ukrainian exports to the eu become more competitive due to trade agreement , thus aiding regime change in belarus and political reforms in moldova . 
  another thing to note is that by having association agreement with ukraine , russian influence will decrease in ukraine , which is another benefit too . 
  the problem with moldova that many other poor countries also face that they are n't lucrative or even competitive destinations to outsource services or manufacturing . 
  ukraine , belarus and moldova would be excellent places to move manufacturing and assembly , but unfortunately due to mix of corruption , lack of rule of law , inefficient state bureaucracy etc. . . investments are not happening . 
  i 'm going to just say fuck off to you . 
  clearly it is waste of my time to talk to you because you clearly do n't have any intend to discuss nor maybe even intelligence for it . 
  please take your mein kampf to your arse and keep it there . 
  the problem with your reply is that you go out and equate my dislike of multiculturalism and demand of having one culture in a country to opinions expressed by mr. hitler in mein kampf . 
  you do understand that with that kind of hardline opinions you are only going to segregate yourself and your opinion . 
  colour of skin , gender or sexual preferences are things that you ca n't decide by yourself , however culture , values and beliefs are something that you can decide . 
  it is wrong to discriminate based on something that you do n't have any control , but it is not wrong to discriminate based on choices that you have made . 
  i for example would never hire religiously devoted , racist , homophobic or misogynistic , those are all value choices that individual has made . 
  i myself am against multiculturalism , there is one culture in finland and that is finnish . 
  if one wants to be finnish i do n't have nothing to say against that , you i have everything against people who do n't participate to our society and share our culture . 
  if you do n't want to be finnish , then you have the freedom to go back where you came from . 
  simple deal . 
  rebranding racism to involve everything will only water it down until people just shrug it off . 
  this is already starting to show when some people and politicians start their sentence `` if it makes me racists that [ insert something ] then i 'm '' ... 
  more or less the same case as in the 80s in finland . 
  small savings banks gave out huge loans , some due to incompetence , but many more because person a knew person b and they had business partner c. fun times . 
  the exception would be opt-out from common fisheries policy , but i do n't imagine that the eu would allow this . 
  on the other hand i do n't think that icelanders would want to ever join eu as long as we have current fisheries policy which should be drastically changed . 
  i have been offered work from other nordic countries , germany and uk . 
  i have n't bothered to move , things are good in helsinki . 
  the only thing that works is greed . 
  greed , for lack of a better word , is good . 
  greed is right , greed works . 
  greed clarifies , cuts through , and captures the essence of the evolutionary spirit . 
  greed , in all of its forms ; greed for life , for money , for love , knowledge has marked the upward surge of mankind . 
  because group of students can make something happen that huge multinational billion dollar corporations such as toyota and volkswagen ca n't ? 
  is that arrogance or is that realism ? 
   this poster is not very old . 
  we do provide language courses and there is something called instegsjobb which is there to make it easier for specifically refugees to get jobs and to function in society . 
  sd were against this because they thought it was discriminating to swedes . 
  we do n't want assimilation , we want them to be a part of our society , whatever their religious beliefs , native language ( as long as they learn our 's ) and customs is none of my business . 
  also we do n't have free immigration , a majority of people who seek asylum are denied . 
  no offence but state provided or subsidized jobs worsen the problem , not fix it . 
  if the economy needs engineers , business majors , doctors , lawyers , researchers , etc. . then you need those people , not people without education . 
  you also has to take into account that for almost any profession , you need a vocational degree which take 2-3 years time to study when you already have basic education . 
  you only set immigrants to fail if you do n't understand this . 
   i think in most of the cultures in the world it is expected to get a job , as higher education is n't available for the majority of the people in some parts of the world . 
  what cultural values are we talking about ? 
  gender equality and individual freedom ? 
  gender equality is still a problem in our current society . 
  men still go around and use sex-related insults . 
  women 's salary are still lower than men 's salary . 
  there has been no pm in sweden who has been a woman ( however i think our current government has more female ministers than male ministers ) . 
  sd who claim to be protecting women 's rights from muslims and immigrants in general are dominated by men . 
  there big differences between countries . 
  you make it sound like that there is no difference between saudi-arabia and sweden . 
  in reality there is . 
  in reality there are huge differences between cultures in case of individual freedom and gender equality . 
  for crying out loud we did n't know term honour killing before there was immigration from middle-eastern countries that put much more emphasis on honour and family than individual centric western cultures . 
   individual freedom as we see it today is also something relatively new to the west , especially gay rights . 
  also our individual freedom is n't something we can take granted for just because `` it 's our culture '' . 
  new laws are every now and then trying to be passed regarding surveillance and wiretapping . 
  also you do n't seem to be a big fan of individual freedom because you want everybody in finland to become finnish and to abandon their own culture in favor of your 's .

  the comment sparked an outrage , with headlines like `` arhinm\u00e4ki made cheek 's mother cry '' and yes , it was inconsiderate for a culture minister to say such things , to single out an individual performer .

  ** full text : ** ## america issues a travel alert covering europe yesterday , the united states issued a travel alert aimed at those thinking of visiting europe , warning them of the risk of potential terrorist attacks `` throughout '' the continent . 
  on the face of it this seems odd . 
  no one denies that the threat of terrorism this side of the pond is real . 
  france is still operating under a state of emergency following the attacks in paris earlier this year . 
  it will soon host the european football championship , the world 's third-biggest sporting event after the world cup and the olympics . 
  few doubt that terror groups have a beady eye on the event -- least of all france itself , which is deploying 90,000 police , soldiers and security guards to watch over the tournament . 
  it seems reasonable , therefore , for the state department to point out such specific concerns . 
  but how useful is it to apply an alert to an entire continent ? 
  shamila chaudhary , a counter-terrorism expert and former official with the obama administration , told the bbc that terrorism in europe was now `` normalised '' . 
  europeans , she said , `` have been in denial about their domestic terrorism . '' but europe is a large and diverse place . 
  the risks of being caught in a terrorist incident are miniscule . 
  it seems as bizarre to issue an alert for europe as it would be for all of asia or africa ( or indeed the united states ) . 
  travel `` alerts '' do not advise people to reconsider whether to travel in the first place -- that is the job of the state department 's more strident travel `` warnings '' . 
  and according to john kirby , a government official , the current guidance , which is an extension of that issued after the attacks on brussels in march , is not based on specific intelligence . 
  but gulliver is left with a feeling of bemusement that a visit to europe is now akin to an act of bravery . 
  what does this mean for business travellers ? 
  probably little more than some extra ( and pointless ) security training for those intrepid enough to visit the continent . 
  as we have mentioned before on this blog , road warriors are often more measured about the threats they face overseas than casual travellers . 
  most can do the maths and thus reassure themselves about the slim chance of getting mixed up in anything nasty . 
  and in any case , as we also pointed out , underpinning any bravado is the simple fact that people do what their job expects . 
  but companies themselves are becoming more concerned . 
  according to research by american express global business travel ( gbt ) , a corporate-travel firm , over the past two years the safety of employees has overtaken cost to become organisations ' biggest concern when organising work trips . 
  and since the paris attacks , says elyes mrad , the head of the firm in europe , requests for proposals are now more likely to focus on questions specifically related to terrorism . 
  twenty-four per cent of companies now provide travellers with security training before their trip , reckons gbt . 
  firms have a duty to take warnings from government seriously , says mr mrad , but equally it must be remembered that the guidance coming from officials is generic , aimed more at the general traveller than battle-hardened businessman . 
  so firms must be savvy enough to undertake their own risk assessments without necessarily being swayed by the official line . 
  two weeks after the paris attacks , mr mrad decided to move a team meeting from brussels to the french capital to allow staff to show solidarity and to prove that , as far as is possible , business life would continue as normal . 
  that seems like a more sensible approach . 
   we are too reliant on russian gas .

  and eu is a much more diverse place than the us . 
  oil and electricity use are also indicators of your environmental footprint . 
   because that 's the definition of propaganda . 
  cherry picking data to make sweden look better than the us .

  city can mean two things : 1 . 
  administrative region called `` city '' . 
  like `` city of london '' . 
  a relatively large and dense urban area . 
  espoo , helsinki and vantaa are administratively separate cities . 
  when people talk about where they live and work , they tend to refer to the administrative cities , especially the people within the capital region . 
  as an urban area they are one whole , one city and is commonly treated as such , for example keh\u00e4 iii seen as the limit of the city , and capital region compared as a whole against the rest of the country . 
  lower taxes for rich people . 
  after all , it started as a private community of rich people .

  yes , the finnish-swedish is a different thing . 
  it 's the mother tongue of swedish speakers here , and they have a different accent in english , whereas those whose mother tongue is only finnish have a different accent from that . 
  edit : where does the term `` moomin swedish '' originate ? 
  do the moomins in swedish dubs speak with a finnish-swedish dialect ? 
  or is it just a reference that it 's a finnish-swedish thing ( tove jansson being a fenno-swede ) ? 
  as a curiosity , [ here 's tove jansson speaking ] ( https://youtu.be/d1_iedjegzq?t=1m53s ) . 
  i have no idea how that sounds to swedes . 
  though it 's worth noting that the mother of tove was swedish . 
  what is quiet singy ? 
  a few english teachers of mine ( native english speakers ) have said finnish so flat that finns seem like slow dumb retards when speaking english . 
  to my ear it is at least . 
  not as much as swedish or norwegian , but still . 
  i 'm not that familiar with icelandic , but iirc it has preserved the monotone of old norse , whereas danish , swedish and especially norwegian have evolved this singy songy tone . 
  finnish also has a flat tone for unrelated reasons , so when speaking english finns too have a rather flat tone as the accent . 
  i noted that for example [ bj\u00f6rk in this video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75wfthpow8y ) has an accent which strongly resembles finnish accent to my ear . 
  [ edit : compare to the [ strong accent of our former prime minster ] ( https://youtu.be/gxsqzbhalfw?t=9s ) ] incidentally the dialect of swedish spoken in finland also ( to my knowledge ) has somewhat preserved the flat tone of old norse , and some rural swedish in finland preserves some features which only remain in icelandic too .

  when the ticket inspector came and greeted us with '' * sgyygh flgorgh fglyoyherg * '' and kept talking to us we could hardly contain our laughter .

  there 's also [ this finnish skit ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_gtamzdloc ) about a danish biologist skiigge b\u00f6y on an excursion to finnish nature . 
  yea it 's not really architectonic . 
  all the stations are built the same way with the same basic structure ( 90 meter platform with exits on both sides ) and it 's just decoration and lights to make them different from each other . 
  there has been shorter trains before . 
  the [ blue lights ] ( http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-jlvvofexxwy/t4qlz2ub0wi/aaaaaaaaacy/jiba8oy48ti/s1600/_dsc9621ps.jpg ) have for a long time marked where the short trains stop on the platforms . 
  so that 's why it 's not entirely clear are all the trains short now , as there has been shorter trains before . 
  i was especially thinkin of rogue one . 
  it 's because some of the deleted scenes [ were shot in a subway station in london ] ( http://i.imgur.com/4x42qmy.jpg ) . 
  they calculated that with the shorter interval of trains , there actually will be more carriages per hour than before . 
  iirc they already switched to shorter trains , and i have n't noticed any change . 
  to my knowledge l\u00e4nsimetro will be late less than a year . 
  it was scheduled to open in august 2016 , but it has been postponed several times and it seems it will be fully running in june 2017 . 
  only recently the construction became a joke , and the delay of 10 months still is nothing compared to olkiluoto 3 , which actually was supposed to open in 2009 and probably will be * 9 years late * , whereas the delays of l\u00e4nsimetro are rather recent , from last summer . 
  also slightly '' * evil corporation with secret underground research facilities focusing on deadly viral mutagens * '', 
  most of helsinki residents have originated from outside helsinki for over 150 years . 
  so the people who are n't drunks move to helsinki and become cunts . 
  no , it 's decades old . 
  every language has phrases like that . 
  think of `` lead lies '' in english . 
  what does it mean ? 
  to be fair , most of inner helsinki still is rather old . 
  architecture [ like this ] ( http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-7z6gwtzkh4g/vq51ohvdfei/aaaaaaaasde/shsfv9psjk0/s1600/img_0097x.jpg ) is still rather common . 
  to my knowledge helsinki still has a notable amount of art nouveau buildings by international standards . 
  i know that some old buildings were demolished because they realized it 's more expensive to modernize them than to build a new one . 
  like some buildings did n't have indoor toilets , they had crappy heating , small rooms and spaces and such . 
  iirc reason for protecting it is n't that it 's somehow pretty , but because it is an example of a ( failed ) utopia , an example of the building mania of the 60 's and 70 's . 
  so in a way it 's purpose is to remind `` look what you did '' . 
  i do n't know anything about the situation in india , but to me that sounds doubtful as india has over a billion people and to my knowledge has no social safety nets comparable to finland . 
  finland on the other hand already has minimum income and only 5,5 million people . 
  it 's a test . 
  they realistically can not test it with all finns without any previous tests of ubi . 
   i wouldnt say im similar to the russian rebels in ukraine . 
  similar * rhetorics * , not similar actions . 
   i have both swedish and finnsh citizenship and i lived in \u00c5land during the years that really shape you as a person so i identify as an \u00c5lander bc thats were i grew up and have relatives . 
  then why did you say stockholm is a `` foreign '' capital if it is the capital of your country of birth , of which you have citizenship of and where you have lived most of your life ? 
   i dont think you should compare me to perus or sd . 
  that is very unfair , im fine with finland being multiethnic but i just dont see any reason for \u00c5land being a part of finland . 
  your talk about how '' ** if we had our own people defending us and representing us ** '' and '' ** obviously you want people with your language and culture representing you . 
  nations are built upon that ** '' has strong undertones against a multi-ethnic society . 
   finns would stop having to accommodate \u00c5land in their politics and \u00c5landers would get more influence over their island . 
  were \u00c5land part of sweden , it probably would have less influence in sweden as * it would n't be a minority language in sweden anymore and would have no need for autonomy to protect the language * . 
   \u00c5land was before 1809 part of `` swedish '' sweden , finland was distinct in the sense it was treated as one of swedens 4 `` lands '' alongside g\u00f6taland , svealand and norrland . 
  [ half of finland was part of norrland ] ( https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/norrland#/media/file:map_swedish_lands.png ) . 
  if we follow your logic , then all of norrland should belong to finland or to sweden . 
  so , which is it ? 
  are finnish lapland and northern ostrobothnia parts of `` swedish sweden '' or should the modern swedish norrland be a part of finland ? 
   so swedish speakers in finland speak distinct dialects that are unique to finland whilst \u00c5landers speak a dialect related to those spoken in svealand , sweden . 
  all swedish dialects are somewhat related to other dialects . 
  \u00c5land swedish has features shared with both swedish in sweden and in finland . 
  likewise the ostrobothnian swedish is related to westrobothnian swedish dialects . 
   as i said the most important thing for \u00c5landers is autonomy but if presented the option of retaining their current status but inside sweden instead most \u00c5landers would prefer that . 
  asi i said , i have never seen opinion studies which support your claim , only ones that have the opposing view from \u00c5landers , that they prefer to be autonomous part of finland . 
   when walking in the foreign capital stockholm i can speak my mother tongue and feel at home , whilst in my own capital helsinki i usually use english and treated like a foreigner . 
  english is not an official language of finland in any form . 
  if you speak english in finland , of course people treat you like a foreigner . 
  what did you expect ? 
  also in your [ other comment ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6q02ka/wonderful_%c3%a5land_i_grew_up_on_this_beautiful/dkw24sd/ ) you said this :  i was born in sweden to a swedish mom and a \u00c5landic dad .

  seems pretty harmless ( at least in theory ) compared to how they 're often represented . 
  like , if they want to do decide things between them based on their customs , that 's fine for me , as long as they respect the existing laws . 
  waka waka eeh ehh , it 's time for sharia, 
  not to mention make it all spotted . 
  there 's also -40 which is the same in fahrenheit and celcius . 
  it does n't really have any good proof going for it . 
   prozes ei esitt\u00e4nyt v\u00e4itteelleen tarkempia todisteita when you follow the cited source the `` proof '' seems to vanish . 
  it 's basically just someone saying `` yeah , this is totally the deal here '' . 
   if the russian media claims , that some russians lives in a climate of fear in x. 
  would your respond still be ` biased source ! ', 
  surely russians are experts on the issue ? 
  the point being that their possible bias could be affecting their reporting and should be taken into account . 
  ideas going to comment how surely the ( upper ) limits of their airspace sovereignty come into effect here , but ...  there is no international agreement on the vertical extent of sovereign airspace ( the boundary between outer space -- which is not subject to national jurisdiction -- and national airspace ) , with suggestions ranging from about 30 km ( 19 mi ) ( the extent of the highest aircraft and balloons ) to about 160 km ( 99 mi ) ( the lowest extent of short-term stable orbits ) . 
  the f\u00e9d\u00e9ration a\u00e9ronautique internationale has established the k\u00e1rm\u00e1n line , at an altitude of 100 km ( 62 mi ) , as the boundary between the earth 's atmosphere and outer space , while the united states considers anyone who has flown above 50 miles ( 80 km ) to be an astronaut ;, 
  i doubt they 'd declare war on russia and send in troops , but they 'd probably give other kind of support like intel and equipment . 
  i 'd imagine same for nato , when it comes to fibland or sweden . 
  that 'd be awesome even if just for to see the reaction of some of the people on this sub . 
  a lot of people on reddit are considering rt a valid source and a decent news site , when their objective is the same as that of the loonier sites . 
  russia is pretty good at this game . 
  sweden is expensive overall . 
  not as expensive as norway , but quite expensive still . 
  happened upon that store just a few days ago . 
  it 's * way * larger than you 'd think before stepping in !, 
  i thought it would be a cute little boutique , but the there was section after section and then a whole another floor !, 
  almost lost my friends there , haha, 
  ironically ironic ? 
  yeah i do n't really know what you mean by that , that 's too many layers . 
  i 'm honestly annoyed by the `` virtue signalling '' term . 
  it 's almost as bad as `` fake news '' . 
  both are applied so liberally that there 's no sense to it . 
  it 's like when people accuse someone of `` virtue signalling '' . 
  like , so you see the virtue in what i 'm saying and it 's bad because ... ? 
  nazis are socialists , it 's right there in the name !, 
  wake up sheeple !, 
  that 'll teach them !, 
  significantly harder to have a kid that way though . 
  you do n't have to have a relationship to have sex , dummy, 
  please no , / r/mapporn is bad enough as it is, 
  are you serious ? 
  this is a joke, 
  you sure about that, 
  i 'd say it 's just reddit 's finnish community going apeshit and that it 's not representative of finns in general , but this time i feel like that 's not really true . 
  there 's people out there who actually feel this strongly about this stuff . 
  it 's not really `` mistake '' when there 's no set borders . 
  which makes it even weirder why some finns are getting so worked up over this . 
  must be something in \u00e4itiyspakkaus that they forgot to put in mine . 
  what 's triggering about this though ? 
  or am i missing a meme ? 
  are you guys looking away when raising your hand ? 
  if not , that 's your right hand silly . 
  that 's insulting mostly because how unfunny that joke is . 
  it 's like doing `` i 'm going to finnish this , haha '' thing . 
  downright insulting . 
   triggered fins will flock to your comment in hordes and insist that nazi germany and finland in no way fought together but just happen to fight the same enemy at the same time . 
  i know that point is sometimes made in history classes and whatnot , but i ca n't really see people on reddit trying to point it out very enthusiasticly . 
  looks terrible either way . 
  though i guess most of these are meant to be jokes and not actually good looking . 
  interestingly you replied to a wrong comment from me . 
  i 've never seen this before . 
  i was n't talking about my impression in particular , but how he 's generally viewed . 
  you could google `` trump anti-lgbtq '' and see how many complaints there are . 
  which shows that a lot of people see this administration as anti-lgbtq . 
  and that was what i originally said . 
  good that we 've finally circled back here . 
   he has not actually done anything negative for lgbtq some seem to consider statements like the ones from the president and vice president alone in being harmful , but it 's not something i 'd get into since i have n't read anything on the subject . 
   it factors into it because i was making a sarcastic comment with regard to your pathetic virtue signalling . 
  virtue signalling ? 
  what are you on about ? 
   they were saying the opposite of what you said , so no ? 
  you were n't calling out low-effort popular comments ? 
  i thought that was what you were trying to do so i assumed you 'd call out both of us . 
   the fuck does that have to do with anything ? 
  that i had serious doubts , even if you were seemingly calling out low-effort popular comments , that you 'd do it equally to comments from different viewpoints and were n't just `` calling out '' ones that you disagree with . 
  but since you 're calling out `` virtue signalling '' ( ? 
  ) , i guess it does n't have anything to do here . 
  though the term seems to be really popular among the folk that would frequent those subs , so it 's related , if not directly or the way i meant it . 
  how does bravery factor into any of this ? 
  also , you should see the comment i replied to . 
   dae drumpf stupid xd xd hope you congratulated them for their bravery also . 
   moderator of  r/womenfortrump  r/mittromney  r/thanksobongo somehow i doubt it . 
  i 've seen people call anti-trump comments `` edgy '' . 
  i think it 's used just to disparage the commenters , but it could also be because anti-trump stuff is stuff against an authority ( which would be `` edgy '' in a way ) but because it 's popular , it 's * mockingly * called `` edgy '' as in `` not really edgy but a weak attempt at being edgy '' . 
  it gets complicated and like i said , the word has been really overused . 
  and like you said , some people use it to refer to anything slightly provocative or offensive as `` edgy '' . 
  like the german carnival floats where trump was taking it in the ass or something , i do n't remember . 
  though i do think that 's somewhat edgy in the provocative/offensive sense . 
  whether it 's `` true edge '' ( lol ) or something like that , i have no idea , i 'm not sure what the word was supposed to mean originally . 
  so in your mind , do those comments make him seem less or more anti-lgbtq ? 
  you keep repeating that they have n't been banned but i did n't even say he was . 
  just that the act alone of tweeting that they should be banned makes him seem anti-lgbtq . 
   even if he personally is moderate on the issue , it should n't be surprising that his administration is *** viewed *** as anti-lgbtq . 
  i feel like we 're discussing different things . 
  do you mean that the administration is n't anti-lgbtq in their actions ? 
  because i 'm saying that the administration is *** viewed *** as anti-lgbtq because of the comments by the president and the vice president . 
   or am i misunderstanding what people mean by `` edgy '' ? 
  could be . 
  my whole point originally was that everything is labeled as `` edgy '' , it 's used as a general retort even when it does n't really fit . 
  from what i can tell , it 's still pretty popular on reddit . 
  i do n't know about other places or about ( stand-up ) comedy in particular , but as a general retort it sees a lot of use here . 
   `` [ p ] lease be advised that the united states government will not accept or allow transgender individuals to serve in any capacity in the u.s. military , '' trump tweeted wednesday morning .

remove borscht from sweden, 
  some expensive clothes . 
  9 years between the video and award . 
  should he banned from receiving any awards or degrees for what he did long long ago ? 
  least favorite of any european country neighboring russia : russia, 
   finland was irresponsible to become so dependent on such an unreliable trading partner . 
  one of the largest counties in the world , your largest neighboring country , a developing market , common history , common trade from the cold war onward , etc. 
  but hey , i guess we should have ignored them just in case they decide to go full retard . 
  modern mountain bikes with disc brakes have larger rotors in the front , just because the front brake is the more effective one . 
  locking the rear wheel is n't the most effective way to stop , same as with cars and abs . 
  as for using both brakes at the same time , it doesnt take too much practice to learn not to lock them and to change your center of weight to prevent going over the bars/keep steering easy . 
  front wheel brakes are much more effective than similar read wheel ones . 
  tldr would be that when you brake , the weight gets shifted off from rear wheel to front wheel . 
  ask anyone riding a motorbike which brake they use when they actually want to stop . 
  same applies to bicycles . 
  most russians i see just buy basic groceries , toilet paper , cereals , shampoo etc from cities close to border . 
  but the package this is also true , some post offices have been having some problems due to large volume of packages needing to be stored for russians . 
  in finland the maximum you get from goverment as uni student is around 500 $ . 
  after i pay my rent , which includes water etc , i have 250 $ left . 
  i could survive on that , but it would n't be much fun , so i either work part time , or take cheap student loan if i 'm not working . 
  some people are still happy enough to live on ~ 200 $ / month for the 5-7 years it takes for them to graduate , but i just do n't understand those . 
  denmark strong, 
  go and find a nato country with enough money to simply buy two huge ships just so russia wo n't get them . 
  if the country really needed ships like that , most countries would be happy to put that money in their own ship building industry . 
  at least they hit . 
  those bmp 's in the ambush on the other hand are all right next to each other . 
  beautiful until you break a track . 
  then shit sucks even without the civilians there to bother you . 
  military gear gets moved by train all the time . 
  shit , fdf conscripts with 6 months of service look more like soldiers than this bunch . 
  that group of old and fat guys ai n't marching anywhere further than to nearest pub . 
  maybe if you had more than 24 heavy artillery pieces for the whole country . 
  i doubt they would suddenly have that good translator software . 
  its much easier to just hire some guys who speak and write fluent estonian . 
  `` fund '' the north african governments to improve their border control and ensure that they find and deport these welfare refugees before they get to ships . 
  with enough `` funds '' we could pay more than the traffickers pay to officials , and get traffickers to prison too . 
  it also seems to include basically the whole russian army manpower , random number of tanks and aircraft . 
  then it counts mortars for estonias heavy artillery , but not for latvia or lithuania . 
  looks like the reporter went to internet , googled some unsourced infopictures and yahoo answers responses , and then went to make this graphic . 
  ones thinking of doing so were quickly executed . 
  shut up and get in to the train . 
  [ mean while in sweden ... ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pw3e64soseg ), 
  while the thing is completely political , in a way russians is in `` morally '' better position . 
  they are `` defending '' their `` oppressed '' brothers , while argentina attacked falkland islands based on shaky justification on the islands belonging to them . 
  in reality russia just wants to reinforce their position in eastern europe , while discrediting ukraines new leadership , and discouraging spreading of riots to russia by making ukraines riots look like a failure . 
  they do n't seem to have any markings to identify themselves as russian , so i would guess they are militia with russian equipment . 
  now you can go back to / r/pics, 
  so , is the regular police willing to use force to break up the situation ? 
  since the current regime is n't yet too stable , i ca n't imagine them being too eager to take such orders , considering break up of berkut and talk over legal action over earlier fights . 
  knowing you ca n't trust the people giving orders to back you up makes things pretty complicated for the police . 
  finland here . 
  unless you live near some army base , you wo n't be seeing much . 
  armored vehicles tend to stay in their training areas since its so expensive to move them long distances . 
  i think units training for urban combat have some exercises in helsinki , some even in the metro tunnels during nights when they are closed anyway . 
  biggest military parade is yearly on our independence day , and its broadcast in national tv . 
  mostly conscript units marching with a lot of vehicles shown after them . 
  i do n't know why they thought that pepper spray and whips are the best way to approach the situation . 
  [ http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/military_of_switzerland] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/military_of_switzerland ) 200 leopard 2a4 , 200 cv90 , at least decent conscript training , active reserve training , relatively easy to defend country , etc. 
  i 'd dare say your comment is inaccurate . 
  pretty much what i was thinking . 
  since lack of conservation is mostly about money ( not enough rangers/poachers pay larger bribes ) , sell the existing ivory in legal ways and give money to elephant conservation . 
  you 'd maybe get even more money than from the illegal trade . 
  or throw away the money for a silly symbolic gesture . 
  at some point you can just start copying previous `` news in spain '' posts , and nobody will notice , as the content is always the same . 
  i think incoming olympics might actually be big enough factor to not do that . 
   used by western special forces units but not commonly available elsewhere . 
  yes , i 'd imagine most european countries dont allow online ammunition sales . 
  the way guardian talks about them makes it seem like they are something very special secret special forces bullets . 
  just reminded me of the craze over `` cop killer bullets '' some 10-15 years ago . 
  edit : i could n't quickly find online sources for hydra-shock in europe , but i did find multiple mentions and [ photos ] ( http://juutilainen.1g.fi/kuvat/petri+juutilainen/harrastukset/ammo+testit/ruoste+006.jpg ) of it on some finnish shooting forums . 
  also some sites listing it as being in their catalog for security professionals etc. 
  http://www.cheaperthandirt.com/product/amm-407 http://www.academy.com/shop/pdp/federal-premium-personal-defense-hydra-shok-jhp-9mm-luger-124-grain-handgun-ammuni http://www.luckygunner.com/40-sw-165-gr-jhp-hdra-shok-federal-le-50-rounds truly a rare and hard to get ammo . 
  used mostly by special forces and youtubers shooting water bottles . 
  considering games workshops history of being almost consumer hostile company , wildly varying warhammer video game quality , and creative assemblys recent history of barely playable game launches , i 'm pretty reserved on this one . 
  probably closer to ten million than one million . 
   estonia nope , ca n't do that . 
  that 's the rules . 
  i think we have to wait for scotland to recognize its independence first . 
  but we wont be returning people to sweden , as dublin agreements say we could/should do , so all this will accomplish is that those immigrants wont go all the way to helsinki just to register themselves . 
  meanwhile swedish national railway company is knowingly transporting , ( [ even stopping paper checks , allowing some to travel without train tickets , and allowing these people to carry more luggage than usual ] ( http://www.hs.fi/ulkomaat/a1442027290216?jako=798ba35de02ea8bea0a1136269779c16&amp;ref=tw-share ) ) people to northern sweden just so they can come to finland . 
  swedish immigrant authorities acknowledge that these people are going to finland and is doing nothing to it , other than helping them . 
  russia might be shitty neighbor in many ways , but at least their border guards do their fucking job . 
  looks like other one is being kicked on the ground at the end . 
  polar bears are cute though . 
  the first paragraph of the article mentions that . 
  i wonder what their foreign and military intelligence agencies have done in the last 25 years . 
  probably just drank tea and only now remembered that they actually have a job to do . 
  ah right , the incitement case was still pretty stupid , and did include display of double standards using somalis as an example . 
  it is , but i do n't think simply raising a nazi flag is enough . 
  all the sentences on `` inciting hatred against an ethnic group '' that i know of have been of long full retard rantings . 
  ~ ~ other than one case with jussi halla-aho where he got a sentence for making a parody about some magazines opinion piece where he replaced the word finn with somali . ~ ~ edit : see below, 
  tank shoots them . 
  5:18 , then at 5:31 you see a btr that was hit in flames . 
  some redditors speculated that the tank fired a solid penetrator ( apfsds ( ? 
  ) ) , which is why the btr was n't completely obliterated . 
  according to saab , 180kg/m ^ 2 ( weird measurement ? ), 
  and after watching a couple of videos , the thickness required vs sand might not even be that great . 
  i 'm starting to question whether its really that great solution , other than maybe at ships where you do n't really have sand available . 
  looks like that . 
  you probably have had enough time to move away , get more protection or something .

  but you seem quite firm in your convictions so i suppose we 'll just have to agree to disagree , 
  this is , , , bulgaria ? 
  cheers , there is this funny counter circlejerk against sam harris at places like / r/badphilosophy where people make fun of dumb sam harris `` followers '' . 
  so you tend to generalize about you guys . 
  nice to see that some of his fans have some chill . 
  good comment m8 happy new year :d, 
  tbf to myself that was because i looked at his highest rated comments where he explains how islam is the problem, 
   regressive-leftest i might be , how do you define it ? 
  myself i do n't like to generalize people if i can avoid it, 
  you could have just said you like sam harris , woulda saved us both some time, 
  let 's see , your two top comments are  because muslim-majority societies have a strangle hold on the un and have destroyed its legitimacy ? 
  they vote as a block for the most despicable and backwards and always win . 
  and  if you can ban the klan costume and ban nazi flags , then you can sure as hell ban the burka . 
  tell me , what makes you hate greenwald so much . 
  you would n't by any chance be a fan of sam harris ? 
  really ? 
  the guy who broke the biggest story of the century is the same as a website that says the government is turning frogs gay ? 
  smh, 
  while the person you two are describing is true , that kind of person is very uncommon , especially on the left ( where i 'm from ) . 
  just because you are against increasing tensions between the west and russia does n't mean you somehow are a putin apologist . 
  http://www.dailykos.com/story/2013/1/30/1182442/-glenn-greenwald-responds-to-widespread-lies-about-him-on-cato-iraq-war-and-more here he writes about it himself here , he also mentions other misconceptions about his character . 
  he was a practicing lawyer at the time and simply trusted the media . 
  he did n't ever advocate for the war in any way . 
  saying that he was for the iraq war is quite misleading . 
   agreeing with tucker carlson of all people about russia being not all that bad citation needed , i watched that interview , it seems that people are angry simply because the anti-russian hysteric narrative is being questioned . 
  why do people here hate glenn greenwald so much ? 
  what bad things has he done since snowden ? 
  questioning the lack of presented evidence for the `` russian hack '' is hardly equitable to being pro-russian, 
  that 's what happens when you host a google critical documentary on a google owned site i suppose, 
  i dont realuy agree . 
  dn is the most credible newspaper in sweden , is it not ? 
  that 's why the means are controlled democratically you doofus , 
  it 's also real comvenient, 
  that 's the things tovarisch , you are making thigs waaaaay too simple . 
  my guesa is you didnt even really live through any communism, 
  https://www.reddit.com/r/askhistorians/comments/20hf1i/did_stalin_really_kill_millions_of_people_how_do/ here the top response is someone arguing that even including famines the number s isnt higher than 6 million . 
  the 30 million figure seems to be ungrounded, 
  sooo , only people with ballsand brains are on reddit ? 
  sorry m8 , but i dincerely doubt that, 
  trump got like 3 million votes less than hilary , trump only got something like 24 % of eligible votes . 
  also , communism has been widely vilified in various media . 
  people do n't like it for no reason, 
  you 're probably right , i just really dislike the saudis, 
  i do n't think eastern europe was included , so no big surprise, 
  yeah , these anecdotes here might not be useful for understanding communism and it 's impact on those countries, 
  shit if you have enough money you 'll get health care and an education in fucking somalia, 
  possibly implying that the ones who are pro communism are older people ? 
  that does n't matter , here 's a more interesting quote  reflecting back on the breakup of the soviet union that happened 22 years ago next week , residents in seven out of 11 countries that were part of the union are more likely to believe its collapse harmed their countries than benefited them 7/11 hmm, 
  opinion polls from eastern europe often show a relatively high amount who would like communism back , surprising to see so little of that positivity, 
  yeah it 's pretty crazy stuff , it gets lost since it was so close to ww1 . 
  but it pretty much seems like the syrian civil war today , but instead in russia, 
  in the distant future stalin will be seen like djinghis kahn . 
  not for his evil , but for what he accomplished , history is weird like that . 
  his crimes are vastly exaggerated by western society . 
  it 's not like he personally ordered 30 million innocents to be murdered so he could keep power . 
  he indirectly murdered countless of innocents , but not at the scale that we like to think . 
  your point still stands of course . 
   that 's great , and even though new government was n't as efficient as everyone hoped , let 's give it some time . 
  but no if the people have a revolution , partly because they are tired of the war , and the new government keep fighting the war , they are pretty much asking for another revolution . 
   most countries have good healthcare and education ** cough ** * america * ** cough **, 
   industrialisation there is nothing like totalitarian communism if you want to industrialize an agrarian society extremely quickly . 
  your inconsistencies cast doubt on everything you say, 
  most socialists would like the control of the means of production to be with the workers and not the `` state '' . 
  that 's why we saw the kronstadt rebellion and the mahkonists ( spelling ? ), 
  in ukraine https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kronstadt_rebellion, 
  i live in finland , the land with the lowest corrpution index , sadly , we too have crony capitalism , unfourtunately there is no capitalism without some crony in the mix, 
  capitalism is the same system that forces bangladeshi girls to work 14 hours a day so that their little sister will have a chance to go to school . 
  our wealth and comfort is enabled by the suffering of others , such is life in global capitalism . 
  it is debatable if there are any reliable alternative systems , but capitalism sure as hell is n't `` fucking awesome '' for the vast majority involved in it . 
   as there will never be a situation where ** people want to all be the same let alone be entirely the same ** socialism is about the means of production being controlled by workers or the collective , not necessarily everyone having the exact same amount of money all the time . 
  https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2gpfmp/polls_show_eastern_europeans_miss_communism/ many eastern europeans want communism back, 
  i thoroughly enjoyed reading this comment !, 
   the main reason eastern europe isnt as wealthy as western europe is because of the failed communist central planning policies of the ussr convenient, 
   not understanding the internal tribal dynamics and the loose mixture of religion , tribal loyalty and nationalism means a lot of times there is gross simplification can we all agree that saudi arabia are assholes here ? 
  it 's just a bit shitty writing m8 :d but the point is totally true , america is a very dysfunctional democracy atm , 40 % of 21st century elections have gone to the one with less votes , corruption tilts all policy towards the right and imperialism, 
  never seen these, 
  ooggaa boogga people inside these lines are the ones who are good people, 
  this is really confusing . 
  i go to school right in the building behind that stage , also i have no idea what this music is . 
  edit : i looked into it , very sad plane accident , cool music , thanks for posting op !, 
  implying nationalism isnt the most muh feels ideology, 
  fascinating . 
  well , it kinda is, 
  actually the sample size has been determined to be way too small to generate any reliable data . 
  this is basically a vanity project for the government to be perceived as innovative and benevolent while they implement all around austerity and centralize health care to a fewer number of cities, 
  nah we are too influenced by the racist empire sweden . 
  i doubt that your understanding of sweden 's position during the war is very comprehensive . 
  there was a book called `` finlands sak \u00e4r v\u00e5r '' ( the cause of finland is ours ) that sold 600,000 copies . 
  the campaign resulted in a force of around 100,00 volunteers that left to fight for finland against the soviets . 
  in addition the campaign provided economic aid , clothing assistance and medical personnel . 
  the campaign was financed by the swedish industry as well as trade unions . 
  the assistance was desperately needed , as we were both outnumbered in terms of economic , military and man power . 
  i , for one , am very thankful to the swedes that helped us in our time of greatest need . 
  i 'm not sure what you 're suggesting sweden should have done differently . 
  should i turn myself into the hague or will a shin beth team take me to israel eichman style ? 
   most people do n't think germany should carry the blame for the holocaust ( rightly so ) , why should sweden get props for something that happened at the same time and was mainly initiated by the danes in the first place ? 
  i think sweden deserves props for helping us in the winter war . 
  at the same time i do n't necessarily blame the current russian government for the crimes of the soviet union . 
  historical blame for a nation that has changed it 's system of government since then and credit for good historical deeds are not equivalent in my mind, 
  of course not .

  just because they still exist and have a culture does n't meant there is n't racism , i mean do you suggest there is n't racism towards black people in the yankees ? 
  i know not all of them are romanian . 
  i also thinks it 's arrogant to believe that just because romanis have behaved in one way for a long time it 's mistaken to believe it will continue that way . 
  perhaps , a little bit racist . 
  i found an interesting contradiction in your comment  we treat them plenty good but this is how they are and this is how they live  the western countries have no gipsy because they killed almost all of them or sterilized them like they did in scandinavia . 
  racism is rampant against them , to this day . 
  we do n't `` treat them plenty good '', 
  cool , i will . 
  thanks for the tip, 
  this is good news for everyone . 
  maybe some of the poor people begging outside our grocery stores that are romanian will have a large enough incentive to return home and do something more productive then making me feeling guilty about their extreme poverty even though i myself am by no means rich . 
  yeah sure you have a point, 
  is hollande like a worse version of jimmy carter then ? 
  clinton and merkel are hard to compare event though they seem similar . 
  one essentially cause the western regime change in libya among lots of other things . 
  her greatest merits are sitting in talks with foreign leaders , and doing the bidding of american imperialism . 
  merkel , even though i do n't like her , has lead a country for like a decade now , successfully , more or less . 
  clinton was n't liked by the public . 
  the reason she won the popular vote does n't somehow legitimize the `` liberal elite '' or just `` elite '' for short . 
  trump was the most feared candidate in history pretty much . 
  many voted against trump not for clinton i think . 
  merkel is doing what politicians are suppposed to do . 
  lead . 
  and then , if it works out relatively harmlessly people will praise her in the history books . 
  in swedish it means high school as well, 
  i consider myself fairly skilled in language . 
  i can read and write two languages excellently , and one decent . 
  and i agree , i never really learnt finnish or english in school , but rather from tv , watching simpsons in english with finnish subs, 
  same with finland , finnish and swedish is taught to everyone . 
  reading anthony beevor 's spanish civil war right now . 
  it 's really a tragedy your whole history . 
  especially the peasants . 
  as a libertarian socialist i 'll always mourn catalonia . 
  such a rich region running itself without commissars or capitalists could have sent an example for the world . 
  that neither a totalitarian state communism or ( capitalism if you will ) or fascism had to rule the people . 
  the idea that mutual co-operation could rule an area . 
  it 's a shame . 
  the whole thing . 
  his infliction on press freedom does n't seem too severe . 
  he asks for his relatives and children to be unmentioned . 
  nothing yle has to comply with . 
  the more damning thing is that around 100 milllion euros went from the state to a mine that then gave a 0.5 million contract to the business of a relative of sipil\u00e4 . 
  yeah after driving on the road that goes around rome i was convinced you would be higher . 
  people were treating the rush hour as a formula 1 race, 
   the states makes a continuous effort on road safety how would anyone outside spain know this ? 
  our history is of course wildly similar . 
  but from a finnish perspective it 's hard to see why russia ca n't have functioning relations with it 's neighbors . 
  after all france and germany were mortal enemies for at least 200 years . 
  thats like , your opinion , man, 
   iraq was a necessary and successful war m8 whatever you 're smoking let me have a hit . 
  cause that shit clearly fucks you up, 
  maybe you should care, 
  except that one foreign policy decision, 
  having a view point is n't equal to being the british propaganda arm of news corp.  it does n't take much insight to realize that that 's not the outcome that was intended ?? 
  how so ? 
  chairman corbyn would no doubt need to send blair to scotland for 15 years of re education before he can return to politics, 
  iraq was the enemy of iran . 
  if you wanted to weaken iran , invading iraq is violently illogical, 
   ours is more about stability , especially preventing iran from exporting its revolution , for which a secular , democratic and pro-western iraq would be a vital ally . 
  iran has been strengthened thanks to the invasion . 
  after saddam was ousted the new government were basically iranian puppets . 
  so your statement is completely untrue . 
  i 'm not saying that i know exactly why iraq was invaded . 
  but i doubt the reasons were altruistic , and i know that it was at the very least partially motivated by the strategic oil reserves in iraq and the strategic importance of iraq in the middle east as a whole . 
   the guardian is the left 's daily mail and anything in it has to be read with skepticism except the daily mail is a propaganda tabloid that runs what murdoch wants while the guardian is run by an independent trust . 
  the guardian published and got access to the snowden leaks about the prism program and more as well as info about the sykes-picot line a hundred years ago . 
  please do n't put them in the same sentence ever again, 
  that article is simplified . 
  this one is better https://www.theguardian.com/environment/earth-insight/2014/mar/20/iraq-war-oil-resources-energy-peak-scarcity-economy saddam had control over lots of oil . 
  and therefore had the power to regulate the market and increase oil prices by strangulating the supply of iraqi oil . 
  an invasion made sure to sustain global oil flows and moderate global oil prices . 
  there were of course other factors , but most of them were also related to maintaining strategic control over the resources in the middle east . 
  or why do you think the war was started ? 
  turkey is secular . 
  does turkey oppress religious people ? 
  of course not . 
   http://edition.cnn.com/2016/03/15/middleeast/ankara-bombing-female-suicide-bomber/ so your argument is that if you are pro democracy you can not commit acts of violence ? 
  or that you can not perform terrorism if you are pro democracy ? 
  what about the american revolutionaries ? 
  they used violence and terrorism to achieve democracy . 
  if you were british back then you would be complaining about the horrible boston tea party . 
   it will be more like north korea if u ask me in rojava the ruling ideology is democratic confederalism . 
  the idea of villages autonomously ruling themselves with direct democracy as a part of a larger confederacy of these autonomous villages . 
  the ideology is as far away from north koreas totalitarianism as one can imagine . 
  just because a state is secular it does n't imply that religious people are oppressed . 
  are american christians oppressed ? 
  of course not , even though america is nominally secular . 
  also the kurdish state would most likely be democratic confederalism , or democratic socialism , not really oppressive . 
  closer to switzerland than stalin, 
  tony blair has charisma , problem is more than that is requiered to be politically relevant, 
  and do the hpd voters want democratic confederalism ? 
  how much support does the ypg has among the kurds ? 
  he has to be an absolute narcicissist not to understand how hated he is, 
  chillax bro, 
  so kurds are quite religious then ? 
  do they want a religious kurdistan or a religious turkey ? 
  what does this imply ? 
  its hard to inturperet these stats as a non turk ? 
  i followed the situation in mali . 
  it definitely would have been ludicrous to let a few hundred islamists take over a country .

  industrial breweries started booming in the 19th century and the brewing technique with bottom-fermenting yeast was learned from bohemia .

   is the patent on this a problem for developing this kind of technology ? 
  to the contrary . 
  because it has been patented and the patent has expired long ago , the technology is somewhat easier to develop as it has been publicly detailed in the patent and not lost into secrecy .

  helsinki and tallinn signed a letter of intention in 2008 and since then premilinary feasibility studies have been made about a possible [ helsinki-tallinn rail tunnel ] ( http://www.gug.fi/web/page.aspx?refid=62 ) . 
  the hard crystalline bedrock is favourable for building a tunnel , though in the tallinn end it 's covered with 200m of sedimentary rock so the tunnel would probably need to run deep beneath it . 
  the geology of the underwater part needs more detailed geophysical investigations . 
  there 's also experteese of building long tunnels into bedrock such as the 120 km [ p\u00e4ij\u00e4nne water tunnel ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/p%c3%a4ij%c3%a4nne_water_tunnel ) .

  from [ this thread ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/1mrj2p/unfortunate_pixel_fault_on_salford_media_city_big/ ) . 
   i have read the article you linked and that is not true . 
  they are compalining about android and mobile in particular . 
  please re-read what i wrote : the complaint is not about availability of android or about gpl or open source or free software per se . 
  here 's the crux of the complaint in other words as per [ fairsearch ] ( http://www.fairsearch.org/mobile/fairsearch-announces-complaint-in-eu-on-googles-anti-competitive-mobile-strategy/ ) : `` google achieved its dominance in the ** smartphone operating system market ** by giving android to device-makers for ` free . ' but in reality , ** android phone makers ** who want to include must-have google apps such as maps , youtube or play ** are required to pre-load an entire suite of google mobile services and to give them prominent default placement on the phone ** , the complaint says . 
  ** this disadvantages other providers ** , and puts google 's android in control of consumer data on a majority of smartphones shipped today . '', 
   it is all about bundling , which android does not have . 
  right . 
  good to hear we agree on what the complaint is about . 
  it 's about google 's behavior of bundling its software and services . 
  to that point it 's irrelevant if there 's no bundling in vanilla android as the complaint is not about that but what google does with its exclusive agreements . 
   how is google responsible for what manufacturers choose to do ? 
  they can certainly ship aosp + fdroid instead ( or any other number of app stores ) , but nobody is doing it ( google play just provides a better service ) . 
  the complaint is that when android smartphone makers want to include for example google play they also have to bundle other google 's services by default thereby limiting consumer choice . 
   no it 's about mobile as the quoted parts show . 
  mobile does include tablet , so the example is perfectly relevant . 
  it 's not . 
  the complaint is about smartphone market also sometimes colloquially referred as mobile market . 
  laptops are mobile devices too but they 're not what the complaint is about . 
  i 'm sure many would agree that kindle is not a smartphone , neither is a laptop - even if they 're both mobile devices in their own way . 
   samsung is offering their own app store as well on their phones and not all google services are available by default . 
  so it 's either with google play and other google 's services , or no default google 's services only without google play ? 
   nobody is stopping manufacturers from releasing android and bundling it with their own services , exactly like amazon , or with some other services ( you can preload it with bing , bing maps and all that ) . 
  yet the complaint is not about that . 
   android is freely available and anybody can use it as they please ( before they get threatened with lawsuits from microsoft for patent infringement that is ) . 
  their proprietary apps and play store services are not freely available and are certainly not bundled with android . 
  please remember that the complaint is not about the availability of android or about gpl or open source or free software per se . 
  it 's about google 's behaviour in the eu market regarding the exclusive agreements with smartphone manufacturers when bundling google 's services in smartphones . 
   the existence of the kindle fire , which is running android and contains zero google services is a nice example . 
  the complaint is about googles conduct in the smartphone market not tablets , and as an example the existence kindle fire is not relevant to the point . 
  demonstrating that android smartphones on the eu market actually do give the consumer the choice of whether to use google 's services or someone else 's by default would be more relevant . 
   note that windows phone is worse in this regard , because it is bundled with all of microsoft 's online crap . 
  look , i do not care about the companies or their perceived hypocrisy . 
  what i do care about is the consumer choice and competition on the market . 
  and that is what the complaint is about . 
  i do not know if the complaint merits an action , but the posted letter by fsfe certainly does not address my concerns , and i do hope the commission will take a careful look into the matter . 
  his reasoning is basically an argument from ignorance : * a balloon with sampling apparatus is send to the stratosphere . 
  * a piece of a diatom is found in the sample . 
  * says does n't know where it came from . 
  * does n't even try to compare it with the numerous earthly species of diatoms . 
  * therefore : aliens !, 
  every now and then these panspermist crackpots make similar claims and create sensationalist headlines .

  you really think erdogan could find all of the * usa backed islamist terrorists * in the turkish military within a week ? 
  haha, 
  i have to disagree . 
  rt news and sputnik news only appeals to a small percentage of the population that is already prone to conspiracy theories such as nwo , armageddon , 9/11 truthers , ect . 
  it only becomes a problem when our own domestic media has to present their viewpoint in an effort to appear `` balanced '' . 
  you can clearly see this in the us election and during the mh17 shootdown . 
  in the us , which clearly has a giant bipartisan issue with its two party system , liberal media has to walk on eggshells when criticizing trump ( republican nominee ) to avoid backlash from conservative outlets even when he is saying direct lies . 
  same with mh17 shootdown , even though russia changed its story 2-3 times within a week , from saying ukrainian anti air systems hot it down to ukrainian jets , our media reported it anyway , making it appear as its a `` balanced '' approach when russia had literally no evidence . 
  foreign media can only have so much of an effect . 
  as long as we have a large plurality of media sources in the west . 
  and our established media has a decent dose of skepticism when it comes from russian claims let them waste their money . 
  pretty much the entire international community is on board . 
  china is n't even taking a bullet for russia this time . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/political_status_of_crimea#stances great irony is the countries that do support russia 's claim are already pretty isolated and disliked by the international community at large . 
  ( for example , north korea , syria , venezuela , ect ), 
  it got really worse after 2014 crisis and the `` sanction war '' between the eu and russia . 
  its not as direct censorship as in china but if you are `` independent media '' in russia you need to step in line or you wo n't get your broadcasting title renewed . 
  i totally agree , i wrote something similar . 
  the best thing we can do is have volunteer organizations like the [ `` baltic elves '' ] ( http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/03/20/the-baltic-elves-taking-on-pro-russian-trolls.html ) that go out and try to disprove russian propaganda . 
  other than that , we need to make sure russian propaganda does n't get force-fed into our media . 
  in western media we try to find a `` balance of viewpoint '' even if the other side has absolutely no evidence to back up the claim . 
  in the us election cycle you can clearly see this with donald trump . 
  he spews out direct lies and liberal media has to walk on eggshells to try not to piss off the conservatives and `` balance viewpoint '' titles . 
  again , the problem with freedom of press , free trade , and individual rights is that you will always be at a disadvantage to countries who do not follow those rules . 
  russia since the crackdown in the 2014 ukraine crisis has been shutting down independent media and heavily limiting foriegn press and ngos . 
  sadly in the west , that means we are open to foreign-oriented media that comes from russia . 
  channels like rt and sputnik appeal to a small percentage of audiences in the us and europe that are already prone to conspiracy theories and other nonsense . 
  there is no use in trying to change their opinion . 
  in the situation in which this becomes very dangerous , is in the western media we tend to try to give a `` balance '' viewpoint even if the opposing side is spewing too much nonsense . 
  you can clearly see this in the us election , where donald trump says a complete lie , and liberal media has to literally walk on egg shells to try to not piss off conservative media . 
  during the mh17 incident , many news networks kept reporting too much based on russia 's perspective . 
  jesus christ i remember that one week where rt switched from saying it was ukrainian anti-air systems that shot down the plane , to it being ukrainian jets . 
  the problem is our media has to report that bullshit in an effort to seem `` balance '' and that confuses our viewership by making it seem like a bipartisan issue when it really is n't . 
  i agree there really is n't much to be done at the institutional level . 
  otherwise we will be no better in censorship or being selective about media than russia . 
  but in the baltics for example they have the [ `` baltic elves '' ] ( http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/03/20/the-baltic-elves-taking-on-pro-russian-trolls.html ) which is a group of volunteers who try to debunk russian trolls and false media . 
   * about 40 % of all generals and admirals in the military have been dismissed . 
  * talk about a purge . 
  eastern europe basically believes western europe will leave them for dead at the earliest sign of trouble ( some cases is true ) and western europe just sees eastern europe as a liability . 
  the united states has been seen more reliable even compared to european counterparts . 
  arguably one way or another ~ ~ nato ~ ~ the united states held a balance in europe . 
  need to remember , the us makes up 70 % of defense spending in europe . 
  thats a big ally to loose . 
  and while countries like france and germany were hesitant at first in sending troops to reinforce the baltics , the us did it relatively no problem and brought along the canadians . 
  i was reading an article that russia wanted to sell kaliningrad to germany , but germany refused . 
  i do n't know the authenticity of the information . 
  kaliningrad is to russia as israel is to america, 
  well , its not at least like / r/russia where they ban you for having another view point . 
  * `` job interview '' *, 
  yeah , i really only found information on nasmas i. 
  says [ here ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nasams#service_history ) that they are used to guard the airspace around the white house, 
  yes , they could not observe because crimea is not recognized by the un , not apart of osce , and ukraine which is a osce member did not invite the referendum . 
  the majority of polish aa are manual anti air machine guns . 
  most of the finnish anti air surface to air missile systems are mobile short range nasmas ii and crotale systems . 
  international observers were not permitted . 
  they were n't permitted because first off crimea is not a recognized state . 
  and ukraine which is an osce member did not invite osce observers there in the first place . 
  secondly , why would the osce send election observers there when crimea/russia turn back military osce observers ? 
  the whole point is to make sure the election is fair and open . 
  by refusing entry of osce military observers who 's purpose is to monitor conflict zones you already nullify any chance of an fair and open election . 
  russia can not just invade and occupy a territory , and expect the osce or international community to go ahead with it . 
  because russian troops in crimea is obviously a conflict of interest , and the majority of the international community has rightly ruled the referendum a farce . 
  international bodies deciding that the referendum is illegal is not completely different business than openness in crimea . 
  the osce is the largest intergovernmental security-oriented organization and along with the un human rights which boycotted the referendum . 
  its the international bodies that send they observers . 
  the un general body ruled 100 to 11 that the referendum was illegal . 
  and the states that do support russia 's claim are afganistan , cuba , kyrgyzstan , nicaragua , north korea , and venezula . 
  the great irony is the majority of countries that do support russia 's claim are already currently sanctioned and isolated from the international community in the first . 
  we do n't have oil and we ranked pretty good  ; l at least we beat svierge, 
  those smug norwegians with their 100 %, 
  ;( hey we 're not rich !, 
  actually surprised we beat swede . 
  rip atleast sweden is willing to help you against russian aggression, 
  there was an article by mats alvesson and karl yden that claimed that a large part of the officer corps of the swedish armed forces was preoccupied with administrative tasks instead of training soldiers or partaking in international operations . 
  they claimed that swedish officers were mainly focused on climbing the ranks and thereby increasing their wages and that the main way of doing this is to take more training courses . 
  and again finland is still conscription based . 
  having 12 % of officers is a little odd though if you 're comparing it to the us military . 
  qq talk about finland . 
  we 're not a nato member and share a bigger border than any other european country combined with russia . 
  why does n't poland have decent anti-aircraft systems ? 
  finland is non-nato and at least has dozens of norwegian and french anti-aircraft surface-to-air-missile systems . 
  and we have a ton of us anti-air stinger missiles in reserve . 
  sweden 's defense policy is basically using finland as a cannon fodder . 
  i think its because sweden just pays their soldiers a larger salary , and of course that cuts down on the amount of operations and equipment . 
  but sweden does n't share a border with russia so i do n't see any harm in that . 
  i think if nato intervened it would of been a big fiasco . 
  it was one small uninhabited island , and no deaths have even occurred . 
  did you want the united states to send a carrier group to support you guys ? 
  a big portion of defense funding goes to salaries , not necessarily military equipment and operational costs . 
  i 'm actually a bit suprised that sweden spends around the same as finland . 
  ( seeing that you have a population nearly twice our size ) but i guess its because you guys do n't share a border with russia . 
   1,72 oh man , russia must think you are trying to revive operation barbarossa, 
  yeah , the southern military district ( caucasian area ) has even more troops committed than in western europe . 
  yeah , the uk and france outspend russia on defense while only using up about 2.0 % of their gdp . 
  russia on the other hand is going through economic turmoil and even with 5.39 % they can not keep up with the majority of western european countries . 
  pretty amazing that the uk and france both spend nearly twice per person on their military compared to russia , while only using around 2.0 % of their gdp . 
  russia on the other hand has to spend a whopping 5.0 % and can barely catch up to the rest of europe . 
  no you do not understand . 
  the osce was * not permitted * to monitor the so called referendum . 
  observers from the osce earlier [ tried to gain access into crimea ] ( http://www.euronews.com/2014/03/15/thwarted-crimea-mission-of-osce-observers ) but were denied .

  yeah , cause war magically causes everything in the world to turn to desert , oh wait it does n't . 
  because they would collapse . 
  russia has huge landmass , but its still a mere regional power , not something that could fight nato head on . 
  not much of a world war if western allies just kick russians ass . 
  it would be `` the day russian ass was kicked by collective west '' war . 
  or , like napoleon wars , maybe its just called putin war . 
  what a boring name for a war , nobody would read about it in school . 
  no , actually we get rights because there is a state ensuring nobody breaches those rights . 
  they are n't some magical thing that people are born with , rights are not a natural thing , they are a consept created by human minds , they are not real . 
  while you see state as some big construction which is there for you convenience or against it , i see it as a collection of my country men and our efforts create a better place for ourselves . 
  its not separate from us , its part of us . 
  in event of great external threat we all might be required to participate to danger to defend ourselves , that is our resposibilty . 
  my country and fellow country men will ensure i get education , healthcare , safety , even pension . 
  my resposibiliies include paying part of my wages as taxes so we can afford this to generations to come and in case of external threat take arms and defend it . 
  also , military service is one of those things that you do n't have the right to not to do in crisis if goverment so chooses . 
  funny how rights were n't a magical thing but actually just a man made law , is n't it ? 
  even internationally draft and military service are exluded from actions and things goverments can not do . 
  in event of war that requires goverment to draft , you ca n't use `` muh rights '' to run away from it , food for thought . 
  i did n't spot anyt equipment on the apcs that would give free view around them , do they have those ? 
  alteast here in finland apcs are not allowed to be driven without the commander being outside during peacetime , as its very difficult to see anything from inside , its almost impossbible to react to other cars if they fuck something up without commander having eyes out there . 
  incorrect . 
  no , not exactly . 
  i do understand the point , but the calibers you chose has the difference between `` goddamn there is a inconvenient hole trough my palm '' and `` oh my god my whole arm has disappeared in a mist of blood and flesh , and i am going to die painfully '' you actually have to hit very well with .22 lr , where as you can pretty much shoot anywhere with .50 bng and cause a casualty . 
  no , not if you compare those two calibers its not . 
  alone it is n't , but its used as reason to enjoy all the rights , without accepting any resposibilities . 
  if were going to discuss green , the earth is actually completely ok with warfare . 
  it turns the soil more than anybody ever bothers to do and human bodies work as great fertilizers . 
  what warfare does bad is destroy human created infastructure and lives . 
  those however might be destroyed by the invader after the war to even worse extend , if they are allowed to occupy and govern your lives . 
  nature is going to be fine with anything we do , one way or the other . 
  question is if were going to be here to share that change in nature after the fact . 
  did you just tell me to read my own comment ? 
  not really . 
  sometimes there is some small news article about it , but its the online forums or blogs that go `` omg , are they nazis ? '' . 
  theyre great fun to read if you sometimes come across them . 
  goddamn germans ruining it . 
  i want [ the swatika back ] ( http://www.axishistory.com/images/stories/f/fi-brewster-buffalo.jpg ) , its glorious !, 
  for our [ armored forces ] ( http://www.axishistory.com/images/stories/f/fi-t50.jpg ) as well . 
  return the swatika !, 
  flag of the finnish air force staff uses a swatika . 
  it 's always nice to follow the foreigners shitstorm that ensues when they [ march with it in parades ] ( http://globalfire.tv/nj/graphs/fin_officemblem_swastika.jpg ) . 
   thirty - first fighter wing f-16s have deployed to estonia , to participate in bilateral training with the estonian air force . 
  what training does the estonian air force participate to ? 
  quick look at estonian airforce leaves one wondering what their purpose is . 
  radar , anti-air and logistics ? 
  the thread started from question of if finnish military is better than baltic militaries combined . 
  it is , is the anwser , i do not know how you have a problem with this . 
  why should i not do this comparison when it is the comparison asked ?!?!!?!?!, 
  funding is very different and was simply pointed as the reason as to why baltic states do not have considerable military equipments or weapons . 
  finland uses its whole budget to itself , while all baltic states have their own , so efficiency of the combines baltic militaries is weak . 
  `` some data '' , yes you need something that you use to do the comparisons . 
  estonian military budget was not why baltic nations are weaker , they are weaker because they do not have weapons , budget is the reason why they do not have those weapons . 
  as for nonsense about us vs nordics you said , it is not worth an comment . 
  you for whatever idiotic reason really got caught on that estonian budget , i have mentioned the combined military budget of all three baltic states twice as well , nevermind the other factors which you completely ignore and keep on giving bullshit about some fucking estonian budget i only mentioned is comparable to our acquisition budget . 
  its not a point of a lot value in this discussion . 
  -  your do n't seem to read or understand anything i have written . 
  as for my rudeness , so fucking what ? 
  i have zero problems being rude , it seems to be your problem . 
  you said stupid shit about countries size and somehow made that a reason why we can not do comparison here . 
  as a finn i compare military of my country to russia , its quite more capable to do stuff than we are , it is quite a bit larger than we are , it however does not make it stupid or annoying to do . 
  territory is indeed good information to have as well , but that was not really the question here . 
  finland is bigger , it gives them more ground to fight on without risking losing stratetigally important areas , which again is better for finland , where as in baltics many of the important locations and targets are very close to each other and there is very little area to manouver . 
  this can be good or bad for defender , but if you lack equipment to fight this is sort of a moot point . 
  as for your whine about downvotes , i have downvoted exactly one of your comments , the one where you say i compared separate baltic countries to finland , which i never did . 
  oh no , what ever will i do . 
  some idiot over the internet took an imaginary point while disapporing what i posted , oh the horror . 
  could not care less . 
  no way , estonia is not alone the whole baltic ?!, 
  the point was that the part of our budget we use to acquire items is the size that estonia has for its military as whole , you clearly read nothing i wrote . 
  majority of finnish budget goes to keeping the military running , budgets of the baltics are so small they can barely do just that . 
  also , i did not compare separate cababilities of baltics states to finland , i compared them all combined . 
  finnish defence budget is 2,6 billion , combined baltics are ~ 1billion -  finnish budget is 2,5 times the baltics but combined baltic equipment amounts would need to be multipled by a 100 to get what finland has . 
  1,8 billion of finnish budget went to upkeep , i can only wonder how much of the baltic budget goes to that . 
   not so sure if their military is much better than baltic militaries combined finland has 2,5 times the budget combined baltics has , and somehow has managed to scrap togetther more than ten times the equipment baltics has . 
  finland has an adequate air force and ~ 230 main battle tanks , which baltics do n't have either at all . 
  huge indirect fire cababilities , which on baltics is quite small and more about heavy mortars . 
  baltics has a problem with that they are all under funded with all money pretty much going to running the military , leaving very little to aquire new equipment . 
  finland uses 446million for acquiring equipment , thats more than whole budget of estonian military . 
  defensive forces do not need to match the offensive forces . 
  it gives a group of light troops which goverment can use in event of a crisis very fast . 
  while mobilizing reserves can take week or two , a ready militia mobilizes in less than a day . 
  many of these organisations work with military and get their weapons/uniforms/trainers from it . 
  in finland participaring to local defence organization gets you uniform and equipment exluding firearms . 
  well , not that we would mind protecting baltics in event of war , that is what we would be doing if we were part of nato . 
  but taking complete responsiblity of guaranteeing estonia , latvia and lithuania is something we were not in position to do , we have enough military power that we could keep russian incursion from getting deep into our territory , and place some pressure towards petersburg , but were not really in position to be the main force attacking russia in event of a war to keep baltics safe . 
  unless we get some incredible funding from outside to do so . 
   you 're just as much undefendable as we are our defensive capabilities are not even comparable . 
  it always makes me laugh how you get us citizenship if you happen to be born on the mainland , but if you are born on overseas territories you wo n't get citizenship even if you serve in the military . 
  that russian army defeated the greatest military of that time period as well , it was not as it was a completely useless military force . 
  while officer purges weakened their military considerably , it was still massive force and not something you faught against half-heartetly . 
  it still does n't change the facts how much easier it is to defend finnish area compared to attacking it . 
  russian battleships are neat indeed , but unless you plan to wage war on open seas , which baltic really is n't , their strenghts do n't really get to show and even then you require that your enemy is willing to do the same , finns would not do that . 
  finnish sea area is pretty nice for defenders as well , it has lot of small island and with almost no depth . 
  finnish missile boats wo n't be speeding about in the open sea so i am very interested on how you were planning on losing them , battleship ca n't do jackshit if it ca n't find them , which is going to be difficult when these boats have pretty good stealth technology and are hiding around the millions of islands finland has . 
  they are carrying anti-surface missiles which have range of 200-250km and we have these missiles on the ground troops as well , russian battleships wo n't be doing anything on the battic sea unless they want to risk a chance to be sank to bottom of it . 
  as for spetsnaz , annoying buggers indeed , but they will not be even reaching the ground before being shot down , unless they decide to come over the damn sea like tomorrow at 8 and even then it could be difficult as finland does have some anti-air and anti-surface equipment active pretty much around the clokc . 
  helicopters wo n't be flying anywhere , especially not over open sea , helicopters ca n't take a hit from even the most basic form of aa . 
  making a landing from sea is possible , but that would be very expensive and good portion of their forces would be in the bottom of it before they reach their target , after which comes problem of supplying this massive force , which it would have to be if its going to actually be a threat , which they will not be able to do at that point as we would know apporximatetly where they are so we would know where the supplies would be coming to , be it by ship or by air it would be destroyed . 
  force without supplies wo n't fight for very long . 
  this year ?

  for muslim apostates , there are . 
  i dislike both , but muslim ultraconservatism is clearly the bigger threat . 
  social liberals should treat islam as the ultra-conservative political ideology that it is ( similar to how other ultra-conservatives are treated ) - instead of sheltering it . 
  i 'm pretty sure erdogan has a ton of enemies . 
  turkey would likely try to make it look like a defensive war , despite being the aggressor .

  currently it is punishable to carry out certain acts , preparing terrorist crimes , leading a terrorist group etc.

  it is not . 
  they have a law criminalizing it going through currently , so in 2017 it will be illegal , i will post link when i get to my pc it 's illegal to be a major financer , to lead one and to commit and plan terroristit acts thougj, 
  in finland it 's not even a crime to be an isis member , so of course they get asylum, 
  considering that even isis members are being granted asylum in eu nowadays , all bets are off edit so for the downvoters : so here are the links to the fact that being a terrorist member is not illegal : http://www.uusisuomi.fi/kotimaa/147352-ministerio-vahvistaa-terroristijarjestoon-kuulumisesta-tulee-rikos-suomessa it 's in finnish ( use google translate ) , but the key points are that the ministry of justice is planning to criminalize participation in the activities of a terrorist organization so classified by un or eu .

  well if you think about it like that , sure . 
  but from my understanding there was a real risk that erdogan 's turkey would 've joined the eu some time ago . 
  this coup folded because no military big hitters backed it . 
  if the heads of the military actually wanted a coup everything would be over in an instant . 
  at least turkey will never be in the eu . 
  thank god for that . 
   mfw it 's an ` random internet guy tries to lecture cross border m&a consultant ' - episode enjoy my net contributions , polan, 
  it generally is n't in the interest of a nation to disband it 's state , unless there are lower level governments that can take over some of the vital function . 
  certainly disbanding unfavorable cooperative arrangements with other nations can be in the interest of nations . 
  either way , you 're missing the point . 
  there 's no point having eu just for the sake of eu . 
  if it 's not serving the interest of the people , and is merely a vehicle for some federalist dreamers to achieve their utopia , we should n't go on with it . 
  eu is n't a state , it 's a cooperation body . 
  the interest of the citizens of the nations in the eu should come first . 
  the eu as an organisation ought to be completely expendable , and disbanded if deemed to not be a benefit for the citizens . 
   it 's been one of the objectives of the eu for a long time not officially it has n't . 
  of course power hungry people like schulz and van rompuy was n't to concentrate all european power in their own hands against the wishes of its people , but they 're pretty far off still . 
  i 'm pretty sure most people in eu do n't want that , nor did they vote for that when they joined the eu . 
   the reason is to make european countries into one , including the people . 
  ... what ? 
  so what ? 
  they 're right about `` states should n't ban alternative viewpoints om history '' , but wrong about everything else . 
  i think it 's a bit frightening how fast you guys are all for banning free speech , especially over something that happened over a 100 years ago , about which most people will not give a shit what erdogan thinks . 
  exactly , and one day we may find ourselves in a position , where foreign nations begin to ban your point of view of history . 
  it may not seem so extreme at that point anymore , after all , countries like france had done it before . 
  well that would mean there 's something we all accept as true , except for a small band of `` fringe '' views , because someone managed to propaganda us into those views . 
  to me that sounds like even more of a reason not to let governments ban fringe views , even if they appear totally false . 
  sure , but what does banning holocaust denying achieve ? 
  they 're already anti-semites in this case , you 're just giving government more authoritarian powers without any benefit . 
  it 'll be reminiscent of some bizarre psychedelic scenery, 
  why ? 
  what kind of unhealthy road ? 
  it has been legal to deny those facts in finland , yet i ca n't see how we 've gone down an unhealthy road ? 
  education lets people decide for themselves , generally in the right direction . 
  do n't you see the problem with states deciding what is a fact and what is not , and then banning any opposing views ? 
  what if you happened to live in turkey and turkey banned the recognition of the armenian genocide ? 
  the problem here goes beyond an event that happened a 100 years ago . 
  yes because the state has historically been so great at deciding what is fact and what is not . 
  even now we have the state of turkey saying the exact opposite . 
  rather than being forced to accept the viewpoint of whatever state they happen to reside in , i 'd let people get to decide for themselves based on scholars and arguments . 
  goes for other topics as well . 
   if you do nothing about it , history will be rewritten . 
  when has this happened though ? 
  limiting free speech sounds more dangerous than erdogan foaming at his mouth about the term genocide . 
   yet there are still many holocaust deniers in europe so what ? 
  there are always some with silly or contrarian opinions . 
  it does n't mean we need to ban those . 
  the government is of course welcome to state what its view on various issues . 
  governments banning alternative views on history is much worse than a few people 's false view on history . 
  if historians have decided , then let their arguments stand , yes ? 
  it 's not so much turkish propaganda , but the fact that most europeans are n't taught a lot of caucasus history in school , which is understandable . 
  quite frankly , i think the armenian genocide is too far removed in history and geography for many europeans . 
  they are mostly satirists ( trolls ) or complete fringe lunatics . 
  you do n't need to ban flat earth theories because arguments and evidence on why the world is round is so robust . 
  if the evidence and arguments for the factual accuracy of the armenian genocide are robust enough , surely a ban on denial would not be needed to keep the revisionists as a fringe opinion ? 
  and if the evidence and arguments are not enough , maybe there are still thing to discuss ? 
  on a general level it signals insecurity about your own argument if you have to ban opposing views .

  my point was that while hand farming might save space , you 'll have to use a lot more fertilizer etc to keep up with the additional crops per m ^ 2 and it 'll likely wear out the soil quicker . 
  yeah , working by hand might allow you to grow more per area for a few years , however 1 ) total amount of nutrients in the soil remain the same 2 ) farming by hand is so inefficient most of us will have to be farmers to produce the amount of food we produce today . 
   because the biggest barriers to feminism in the eu at the moment are islamic ? 
  they are a big barrier , it does n't matter whether they 're the biggest or not . 
  most of western europe women without a migrant background already have reached equal rights . 
  the focus should be on women whose basic freedoms are limited by the threat of culturally and religously motivated violence . 
  if there are other sects that are as toxic as islam ( and related cultures ) , those should be addressed as well . 
  of course if men live under certain circumstances , those causes should also be addressed ( e.g. 
  scientology ) . 
  the euroskepticism might be bad for netherlands , but certainly more anti-islam politics is needed to secure equal rights of all eu women , including muslim .

  omg finally someone from greece on this sub !, 
  how do you feel about coming from a corrupt country that 's asking for handouts ? 
  plus buying a tesla makes ecological sense there . 
  your energy supply is 90 % co2-free hydro . 
   extrapolating anti-russian activists being shut down to the whole population and make it about nation/race is dishonest . 
  dissent and suppressing popular opinion is oppression . 
  it affects all crimean tatars . 
  even their flag has the ukrainian colors out of thankfulness for the ukrainian government for letting them return , so it 's not a fringe group of people who feel this way like you paint it to be . 
  ebin, 
  1 ) firstly , crimean tatars have lived in crimea for centuries . 
  slavs are a more recent introduction . 
  secondly , the word `` slav '' comes from proto-slavic . 
  `` slovo '' used to mean `` word , '' which contrasts `` nemts '' meaning `` mute '' , a word for foreigners . 
  furthermore , the turkish and crimean tatar words for `` slave '' are `` kul '' and `` qul '' respectively . 
  the use of the word `` slav '' for `` slave '' came from the byzantine greeks .

  karelia is part of russia because finland has accepted the loss of territory and so has the international community . 
  that is not the case between ukraine and crimea . 
  nor is there a reason to change that as long as there is no valid referendum . 
  he said the fuel would be cheap . 
  norwegian oil is not cheap . 
  i never argued about the de facto status . 
  but we should n't just accept their claim for it and concede to their violent takeover of the peninsula . 
  i know i wo n't recognize crimea as russian until 1 ) there is a fair referendum and 2 ) the right of the crimean tatars to their ancestral homeland is secured . 
  this is pure speculation until we find out for real . 
  this guy needs to stop painting crimea with the same color as russia . 
  we ca n't accept the illegal referendum . 
  the local population has to get to decide in a * free * vote . 
  not really , but i wish there was . 
  we really need to hit 2 % . 
  norway is n't a member of opec . 
  but that accent though .

  no , they do n't .

  not really . 
  he hated turks and arabs and was a fan of breivik . 
  islam had nothing to do with it . 
  not all mass killings or shooting rampages are terrorist attacks . 
  the munich shooter was n't -- as far as we know -- connected to any terrorist network nor was his goal to instill fear in the german people . 
  he just wanted to kill people . 
  am from helsinki . 
  can confirm . 
  speak for yourself . 
  if you painted that with a pure white , it could actually look decent .

  i find it extremely undemocratic how a pm can raise to power like this completely unelected . 
  i 'm sure there would have been plenty of people willing to take the job and with more favorable public image . 
  may just had the right party affiliation . 
  shit just got scary .

  arguably it has also led to more people dying on the sea . 
  i believe in the netherlands it 's mostly caused by the numerous greenhouses . 
  i 've always wondered why is it considered economical for greenhouses to light up the sky instead of projecting the light on to the plants . 
  if the greenhouse glasses were made semitransparent , or if there was an electronic system to turn them into mirrors at will , then the ceiling would reflect all the light back into the greenhouse instead of leaking it to the sky . 
  and as a result the plants would get more light with less lamps and with less electricity . 
  but apparently there must be a flaw in my thinking as in reality lighting up the sky seems to be the way to go . 
  can anyone familiar with greenhouses shed some light on what is wrong with my idea ? 
  why is it not being done ? 
  i do n't have the stats from austria , but here 's a related research paper by institute of criminology and legal policy in finland : http://www.optula.om.fi/material/attachments/optula/julkaisut/tutkimuksia-sarja/xz5bk8f2h/265_lehti_ym_2014.pdf compared to native finns the crime rate of rape is 13 times higher by men immigrated from middle-east or north-africa ( mena ) . 
  and that is after accounting for sociodemografic factors such as age , income , and housing - those factors do not explain the fact that immigrants from those regions are far more likely to commit rape than native finns or immigrants from other parts of the world . 
  in 2012 third of all rape convictics in finland were of foreign origin and in aggravated rape 41 % which is alarmingly high considering their small percentage of population . 
  so , at least in finland it is a fact supported by data that males from mena are far more likely to commit rape than males from other parts of the world . 
   i am confused . 
  i thought the right is in charge of the country ? 
  they may be but they 're not running the labour party . 
  the muslim women 's network uk says discrimination and systematic misogyny has been going on for decades in the labour and that the party is complicit in it . 
  [ here 's relevant part of their open letter with some very good questions addressed to the labour leader jeremy corbyn . 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/xfvnqc6.jpg ) i do n't think problem in labour party is something other parties should be fixing . 
  i think that task should fall onto the left in uk , and fairly so . 
  the discrimination reported in the article has been going on in the labour party and it is only approriate to call out the left in the uk on that . 
  the muslim women 's network uk says that such discrimination and systematic misogyny has been going on for decades in the labour and that the party is complicit in it : [ women 's rights organisation says muslim women ` blocked from seeking office by male labour councillors ' ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/leading-womens-rights-organisation-says-muslim-women-blocked-from-seeking-office-by-male-labour-a6857096.html ) * muslim women 's network say the national labour party is ` complicit ' in local male muslim councillors ' ` systematic misogyny ' * edit : [ here 's relevant part of their open letter with some very good questions addressed to the labour leader jeremy corbyn .

   why does everyone go for the nazi camp thing on this sub i never suggested anything of the sort and do n't act like i 'd even consider it . 
  i did n't say anything about nazi camps and i do n't know why you choose pretend that i did . 
  i think establishing nazi camps in europe would be a bad idea , and i would not support nazi camps even if someone proposed them . 
   at the end of the day i was arguing that integration should n't be solely down to the individual but also encourage by society and the government . 
  yes , i very much agree with that . 
  but is n't that being done already ? 
  i mean at least over here there 's language courses and other relevant education readily available - and i 've worked as a teacher on such courses myself . 
  yet even with the assistance and opportunity provided by the society there will always be those who are not willing to actually integrate , and choose to see the values of the society they have migrated into , such as egality , as abhorrent or even blashemous . 
  and then they try to rule other people around them by imposing their own incompatible set of rules and values , which leads to blatant wrongdoings described in the op or even worse [ to things like this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/a3alral.jpg ) . 
  in such cases i do n't think the problem is lack of assistance integrating but the unwillingness to integrate . 
  as the old idiom says , you can lead a horse to water but you ca n't make it drink . 
  so far the law-enforcement has done pretty good job in finland , and they managed the events of the new year 's eve pretty well - at least if compared to what happened in cologne . 
  on the new year 's eve the police was warned beforehand about a planned mass-gathering of asylym seekers in helsinki and the police was prepared accordingly . 
  still the number of sexual assaults in helsinki that night was high and police received reports of one rape , two attempted rapes , and 12 other sexual harrassment cases . 
  now there are reports that there will be another planned mass-gathering of asylym seekers in helsinki tomorrow night . 
  there has been messages circulating in the social media and asylym centers calling for gathering at the center of helsinki on saturday evening at eight o'clock . 
  the police has prepared by doubling their presence . 
  yle report : http://yle.fi/uutiset/poliisi_vahvistaa_joukkojaan_helsingissa_lauantaina__uudenvuoden_tapahtumat_voivat_toistua/8653250 google translation : [ police to strengthen its forces in helsinki on saturday - `` new year 's events could happen again '' ] ( https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=fi&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=fi&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fyle.fi%2fuutiset%2fpoliisi_vahvistaa_joukkojaan_helsingissa_lauantaina__uudenvuoden_tapahtumat_voivat_toistua%2f8653250&amp;edit-text=&amp;act=url ), 
  how do you propose the society should help integrating those who do n't want to ? 
  some sort of forced integration ? 
  re-education camps ? 
  or what ? 
  having a special open doors day is not the best way to conduct such pr campaign . 
  churches and synagogues are open to everyone and anyone can visit . 
  declaring a special day when mosques are open to public might be counterproductive : the message can be perceived as the opposite of openness as if mosques are n't normally open to public but need a special day for that . 
  instead of a special day a better way to do such pr would be to have a longer campaign , at least a week or preferably much longer with the message : welcome any day . 
  the same thing as always - try to take over the world !, 
  you can lead a horse to water but you ca n't make it drink . 
  of course the society can provide assistance and opportunity to better integrate , but should n't integration be first and foremost individual 's own responsibility . 
   why just the left ? 
  the reported discrimination based on systematic misogyny happened within labour - a leftist party which at the same time chooses to boast about their record in selecting female and ethnic minority candidates . 
  edit : the muslim women 's network uk says discrimination and systematic misogyny has been going on for decades in the labour and that the party is complicit in it . 
  [ here 's relevant part of their open letter with some very good questions addressed to the labour leader jeremy corbyn . 
  assad and russian bombs . 
  could you please name the criteria that cyprus did not fulfill ? 
  because i 'm not aware of any . 
  what a speech , i actually burst into a spontaneus applause . 
  estonia , i 'm jealous of your ability to produce true statesman-kaliber politicians - first lennart meri and now toomas hendrik ilves . 
   like usa never supported terrorists or gave them weapons i do n't think the us was supporting those guys . 
  yup , he 's the guy who wrote some of the biggest lies about 9/11 . 
  basically , whenever something notable happens that guy lies about what happened . 
  a liar by trade . 
  apparenty the term does not originate from the colour of the paper but possibly the colour of ink or a popular comic * the yellow kid * : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/yellow_journalism#origins:_pulitzer_vs._hearst, 
  yeah , seems that has become more and more common , yet that is an unfortunate usage of the word tabloid as print size has little to do with content or editorial policy . 
  the term you 're looking for is * yellow press * . 
  well , being a tabloid does not tell you how good or bad a news outlet is . 
  for example , all finnish leading newspapers are tabloids - yet that does not mean they 're unreliable or anything like for example the daily mirror . 
  i think having a grudge over what happened in 2008-9 might be more relevant , and left saudi arabia with little reason to trust russia . 
   six opec countries , russia agree to hold emergency meeting the problem with the claim `` six opec countries '' is the exceedingly short list of countries provided which has only five countries named ( venezuela , iran , russia , oman , iraq ) and of which only three actually are opec members ( venezuela , iran , iraq ) . 
  could you parse your comment ? 
  i do n't know what `` news part coems from oben '' is . 
  additionally , he very specifically talks about government agenda . 
   there are many , many media outlets out there which report precisely and passionately and refuse to be intimidated . 
  they are viewed , listened to and read . 
  you could start to list examples in germany here -- the primetime heute-journal news on public broadcaster zdf , the s\u00fcddeutsche zeitung and frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspapers , for example -- but the list could go on and on and would never be complete . 
  i find it surprising the editorial does not even mention what the former director of zdf bonn wolfgang herles just recently said in a radio interview : that the public broadcaster zdf 's reporting - what to report , how to report and what not to report - is set by government agenda . 
  he calls it scandalous , and that such pro-government journalism leads to people losing their trust in journalists . 
  here 's the relevant part of the interview with english translation : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_8kdqkp0q6q i find his comments especially interesting considering how vocal germany has been in bashing poland . 
  i spotted the story on / r/journalism yesterday : https://www.reddit.com/r/journalism/comments/43xq6m/former_head_of_germanys_zdf_admits_national_news/ also yesterday there was a number of english language reports on this but today they do n't seem to appear on my google search any more for some reason . 
  today google says some search results have been omitted . 
  which is a bit strange coincidence . 
   us did start to destabilize that region way back when they wanted to end ussr by funding independent rebels it was actually the ussr that invaded afganistan starting the war there . 
  and if that 's not destabilizing then i do n't know what is . 
  yet the history of violence in the middle east region goes far further back than that . 
   the whole destabilization of the middle east ( geography lesson here , libya is n't the middle east ) is the consequence of the us led invasion of iraq . 
  right , nothing happened in the middle east before 2003 ... 
  must have been a die-hard fan . 
   its already accepted that immigrants do n't take your jobs indeed they mostly wo n't as only 10 % might get a job in the first year :  the integration of refugees in the german labor market will be a lengthy process . 
  of which go from the federal labour agency , so scheele . 
  ** `` we should not have too high expectations . 
  if things go well , maybe ten percent in the first year after entry have a job after five years is the half , after 15 years 70 percent . 
  ** `` the local workers would need in the foreseeable future no competition by the refugees to fear . 
  `` for her aufholweg is much too long , '' said scheele . 
  but scheele acknowledged that refugees with local long-term unemployed could compete for jobs . 
  that could be so in individual cases if no specific qualification is required . 
  source , frankfurter allgemeine : http://www.faz.net/aktuell/wirtschaft/wirtschaftspolitik/fluechtlinge-kosten-deutschland-bis-2017-rund-50-mrd-euro-14045355.html  immigrants do n't help or worsen economy in any direction i do n't know how adding long term unemployment by millions is good for the economy . 
  their reporting on this is correct . 
  promoting a special day may be counterproductive - as i already explained above .

  you do n't win a war by sending massive human waves against a smaller opponent . 
  you do n't win a war by ordering a mechanized assault through a mountain range . 
  t-34 would most likely have very little use in modern war , but the thing is that t-72 is not t-34 . 
   saddan hussein tried to do that against americans in the gulf war ... you know what happened ?? 
  he was not given a chance to even shoot , their tanks were taken out before they even had a chance to fire back . 
  85mm tank gun from world war 2 also can do plenty of damage against anything , but the thing is if you enemy has more advanced weapons , you wont have a chance to use it . 
  in gulf war , t-55 's and t-72 's had no chance to do it , most of them got wrecked before even firing anything at anyone . 
  that 's because iraqi army was utterly shit from every aspect other than size . 
  they hardly maintained their outdated equipment , they did n't have competent leadership , their troops were demoralized and they did n't have any idea of how to wage war . 
  usa was a polar opposite . 
  so is russia . 
  they actually have military doctrines that work . 
  they actually have competent leadership and military strategists . 
  they actually have modern technology which they know how to utilize . 
  the situation is completely different . 
  americans could n't snipe russian t-72 's beyond their range because they would n't sit in open trenches in the middle of a desert . 
  americans could n't bomb everything to pieces because russia has state of the art air defense system and capable ( albeit small ) air force . 
   and here we come back to that military budget problem . 
  americans are not the only ones who have very advanced tanks and weapons that will outrange russian stuff , only thing russia has is raw numbers . 
  and that frankly is not worth much these days yeah it is n't , but the thing is that russia has a lot more than just raw numbers . 
  they have well trained readiness units , they have state of the art technology in areas that need it , they have tons of modernized and entirely capable soviet-era equipment , they have experience and long military traditions . 
   air superiority is far more important thing than territory you 're going to hold . 
  airborne division can be transferred fast from place a to place b in pretty much instant . 
  also given russia 's geographical location it 's not hard to push over flat terrain . 
  territory creates security and russia has always relied on it when it comes to fighting against an invader . 
  how easy was it for napolean or hitler to push over russian flat terrain ? 
  what comes to air superiority , how are you going to maintain it on an area as big as russia , especially when you have one of the best anti-air systems in the world against you ? 
   russia has no global relevance . 
  yeah , keep telling yourself that . 
  * attacking an opponent 's character rather than answering his argument . 
  * i did answer your argument and before that i called you a silly fuck . 
   it 's not western nation , neither it is considered as western nation . 
  not even russians consider themselves a western nation . 
  oh really ? 
  read a fucking history book ... 
  they are part of europe and they are part of the christian world . 
  they have followed western ideologies and adopted western traditions and customs throughout their existence ... 
  even if they may oppose some aspects of the modern `` western '' culture that is dominated by the usa , they are still very much a western country ...  because ussr was a superpower , russia is not a superpower . 
  do you understand ussr was made out of 15 different countries ? 
  of which russia was the biggest one and had the most influence and power in ussr . 
   again you do n't know what 3rd world countries mean . 
  their gdp is lower than india 's . 
  and their population is 10 % of that of india ... how many russians do you see shitting on the streets ? 
  well , india will become a true giant at some point , but they are still very underdeveloped in many aspects . 
   given how much more natural resources they have than norway : 26,490 $ ( russia ) vs 69,249 $ ( norway ) says it all where they putting their money , doing same mistake as ussr did . 
  russia 's economy is not very diverse , especially compared to countries like norway , but it 's not a banana state either . 
   ussr , not russia . 
  ussr was led by russia and russians . 
   they still ca n't project their influence globally other than small neighbouring nations through warfare that alienates them more than helps to expand influence in region . 
  is syria their neighboring country ? 
   that means nothing in modern world . 
  yeah , absolutely nothing . 
  it 's all the same is your country a small city-state or a large empire having half of the planet within its borders ... who cares about silly resources and sheer size , completely irrelevant . 
  i mean yeah , size is not the most important aspect when it comes to global relevance , but it still matters ...  9th by population ... 
  so nigeria and pakistan is now relevant to everyday politics too ? 
  no , you silly fuck . 
  i have just stated around million and one reasons why russia is still relevant , population being one of them . 
  those same reasons do not count to pakistan or nigeria ...  economy that is built on natural resources extraction just like middle eastern and african countries are , once reserves are out , good luck with that `` economy '' . 
  given their potential they 're super behind on what they could have been . 
  except that russia is not a 3rd world country . 
  it 's an industrialized western nation , with a lot of resources . 
  do you understand that ussr competed with us for several decades ? 
  do you understand that it 's not possible by just exporting natural resources like resource-rich 3rd world countries do ? 
   saudi arabia has invested more money in their military , than russia . 
  i think thats saying something . 
  yeah , it says that saudi-arabia is investing more money to military than russia . 
  do you think warfare is all about money ? 
  russia has decades of more military tradition than saudi-arabia and they produce pretty much all of their equipment in their own soil . 
   russia counts as powerful right now , because of all the leftover weapons and tanks they have from soviet era . 
  and those things are getting older each year , and russia doesnt have the money to replace them with modern weapons . 
  if russia is willing to invest in something , it 's their military ... 
  so money has never been an issue ( well , maybe in the 1990 's ) for russia . 
  the thing is that they do n't have to replace all of their soviet-era equipment because it 's built to last ... 
  there 's a reason why my country also utilizes old soviet equipment to the fullest : it 's cheap , it 's reliable and it gets the job done . 
  not many western apc 's costs 18 000 $ per unit like mt-lb did when we bought them from sweden ... russia is constantly modernizing their military in areas that require modernization . 
  even if most of their military consists of conscripts and older soviet-era equipment , they still have extremely well trained and modern readiness units as well in their military . 
   you can boast about your mighty t-72 tank army only for so long , until people realise they are old outdated shits that pose no danger . 
  yeah , let me shoot you to your face with a 125mm tank cannon and let 's see will it pose any danger ...  to give a comparison - usa has 8000 m1 abrams tanks ( all of which are modern machines with latest technology ) , while russia has something like 500 t-90 's and 300 t-72b3 ( that barely pass as '' modern '' machines ) . 
  the rest of their inventory are old garbage from 1970 's . 
  yeah , and that 's why american military costs ten times more ... 
  maintaining such military would be an economic suicide for a country like russia . 
  like i said , usa has been the global leader in pretty much everything for the last 100 years . 
  but when we compare russian military to that of european countries , it 's far superior . 
  and probably way more cost-efficient than american military ... 
  eu consists of 28 independent nations ... 
  it does n't even have its own military . 
  china on the other hand is already huge , but still very underdeveloped in many aspects . 
  usa , well , usa has been global leader in everything for the past 100 years ... russia was the second most powerful country in the world less than 30 years ago ... 
  they still have the second most powerful military in the world and they are even pretty much self-sufficient when it comes to military equipment . 
  russia is the biggest country by area and ninth biggest by population . 
  it has an enormous amount of natural resources and pretty large and developed economy . 
  russia might not be as relevant as they were 50 years ago , but whether you like it or not , they are still pretty relevant . 
  green dog car . 
  that 's also an idiom that makes no sense . 
  behind the times ... do you even understand how stupid it is to say something like that ? 
  it 's impossible to be `` behind the times '' ... countries that have n't adopted same-sex marriage just have n't adopted it . 
  adopting stuff like that wo n't magically bring your country `` forward '' in time ... 
  it makes no sense . 
  cuz money  cultural heritage what a sad world we live in . 
  and its size , and its resources , and its military , and its previous position as a global superpower ...

   in february , the austrian parliament amended the country 's century-old `` islam law . '' the new legislation , though controversial , is a significant achievement . 
  in promoting a moderate , homegrown islam compatible with democratic values , austria has taken a positive step to combat extremism while protecting religious liberties . 
    the original islam law , passed in 1912 , sought to integrate thousands of muslims who officially came under the rule of the austro-hungarian empire following its annexation of bosnia and herzegovina in 1908 . 
  predominantly roman catholic , austria-hungary extended muslims the same rights of worship as other official religions , and granted state protection to islamic customs , doctrines and institutions . 
  but the empire 's breakup following world war i left just a few hundred muslims in austria , and the islam law became irrelevant . 
    the current landscape is vastly different . 
  a 2014 university of vienna report put the number of muslims in austria at over 550,000 , or about 7 percent of the national population as of 2012 . 
    the number of muslims first began to increase in the 1960s and 1970s , with the arrival of tens of thousands of guest workers from the balkans and turkey . 
  refugees from bosnia and kosovo followed in the 1990s ; more recently , austria absorbed thousands of asylum-seekers from syria , afghanistan and iraq . 
  there has also been natural expansion among second - and third-generation immigrants ; as of 2009 , about half of the country 's muslims were austrian nationals . 
    the reforms follow years of lobbying by muslim leaders , who argued that their people have effectively remained second-class citizens . 
  the updated law confirms islam 's official status and expands muslim rights . 
  muslims will be allowed time off from work to observe islamic holidays and be able to receive spiritual care and halal meals in hospitals , prisons and the armed forces . 
  the law also establishes a theological program for imams at the university of vienna , where instruction will reinforce european social values . 
    but other reforms , which vienna says are aimed at counteracting extremism , are contentious . 
  the updated law bans other countries from financing islamic groups , and bars foreign clerics from leadership positions in austrian mosques . 
  all imams must speak german , and muslim clergy must prove `` professional suitability , '' either by completing the university of vienna program , or demonstrating equivalent training . 
  stressing that austrian law takes precedence over shariah , it requires muslim organizations to show a `` positive attitude toward society and state , '' or risk closure . 
  ( it remains unclear exactly what constitutes a `` positive attitude , '' or how this will be monitored . ), 
    austria 's reforms set a precedent in europe , where concerns about extremism have been echoed by other governments . 
  the french prime minister , manuel valls , has voiced disapproval of a `` reflexive '' reliance on foreign funding by france 's muslim institutions . 
  sebastian kurz , austria 's integration minister , says german and swiss officials have expressed interest in similar financing controls . 
    advertisement   continue reading the main story  advertisement   continue reading the main story   austrian reactions have been mixed . 
  muslims have generally -- if grudgingly -- accepted the reforms . 
  the islamic religious community in austria , an umbrella group that helped draft the amendments , conceded that the outcome `` probably comes closest to the needs of both parties . ''   but because austria 's christian and jewish groups do not face language restrictions , and may receive foreign financing , others find these measures highly discriminatory . 
  some muslim organizations have vowed to bring complaints to austria 's constitutional court . 
  on the other end of the spectrum , the anti-immigration freedom party opposed the law , deeming it ineffective in curbing extremism . 
    some objections have merit . 
  a blanket ban on foreign financial support is a blunt instrument that risks alienating muslims by subjecting them to special rules . 
  and while many islamic institutions depend on foreign funding , not all of these donors have extremist ties . 
  but the law eschews any attempt to differentiate between foreign sources , and some moderate islamic groups are unlikely to survive . 
  even the organization for security and cooperation in europe , reviewing the proposed bill , found the ban unnecessarily broad . 
    the language requirements may not achieve much : extremism is as likely to spread in german as in any other language . 
    but these measures respond to a real concern . 
  a small yet growing number of austrian muslims is embracing radical islam ; officials say nearly 200 have left the country to join jihadist movements in the middle east . 
  with the reforms , vienna is acknowledging the current climate while striking a balance between civil liberties and national security . 
    freezing foreign revenue streams remains the best way to encourage the development of an independent austrian islam . 
  the ban is aimed especially at turkey and saudi arabia , which are vying for leadership of the sunni muslim world and whose governments have exported their competing versions of islam to austria for decades . 
  saudi arabia , which has been accused of sponsoring the spread of salafism and wahhabism -- anti-western ideologies that seek to impose shariah -- has financed the construction of mosques in austria and operated schools and cultural centers . 
  turkey 's president , recep tayyip erdogan , has urged austria 's turkish muslims to reject assimilation . 
  according to mr. kurz , at least 60 muslim clerics currently working in austria are turkish civil servants paid by ankara 's religious affairs directorate . 
    funding by saudi arabia , turkey and other foreign governments is often aimed at shoring up their broader geopolitical interests . 
  preserving this patron-client relationship will only impede the full integration of austria 's muslims . 
  the financial restrictions are necessary in order to break these ties , and will help foster greater self-determination . 
    austria 's updated islam law may be imperfect , and muslims have a right to request more nuanced legislation . 
  but to the extent that the reforms broaden the rights of austria 's muslims , and help thwart extremist foreign influence , they are essential . 
  one century ago , austria officially recognized islam . 
  today it may again be at the vanguard of muslim integration .

  http://www.expressen.se/kvallsposten/arminas-15-skrev-sjalv-om-konflikten/  two versions of why  there are currently two versions of the reason for that arminas killed . 
   14-year-old father in an interview with aftonbladet claimed that her son was subjected to bullying by arminas pileckas . 
   prosecutor pernilla tallinger leading the preliminary investigation has not wanted to comment on what the 14-year-old said in interrogation . 
   - it has been a long interview with him in which he gave his views on the matter , she has previously told the evening post . 
   the other version is that arminas pileckas protected a classmate against the 14-year-old and asked him to let his classmate alone . 
  it should have triggered the altercation at the end of november . 
   several sources told the evening post that at least two witnesses heard by the police supports that version . 
   the swedish media council ( governmental body ) if swedish government dont like it then it is doing something right . 
   according to the father , the real background to the assassination at g\u00f6inge school in broby , sk\u00e5ne , is that arminas had been in a minor brawl with the syrian student in december . 
  the syrian had sexually harassed a girl and arminas came to her defense . 
   -- a week later , we went to the school for a meeting . 
  the boy swore he would take revenge on him , and that is what he did , says the father .

  bottom bar is where age/gender/income / area is taken in account .

  however there are always risks in any system , you just have to deal with them . 
   i have not thought about this one at all . 
  could you explain more what you mean by this ? 
  does this mean that finland is somehow less likely to be invaded by the russian army or something if it is in a currency union with france and germany ? 
  ( i admit ignorance of finland 's geopolitical security situation ) . 
  in short yes , and further integration with central europe will drive this . 
  you might ask should n't we have then a bigger army or ally with nato , and to this i have to answer that security is balancing act . 
  if finland would arm itself to the teeth or ally with nato , it would scare of the russians , and that is something that we do n't want to do . 
  however deeper integration with the eu is less frightening because they do n't see it as an potential aggressor , a powerful and potentially troublesome neighbour , but not something that would actively seek aggression . 
   true , but since your biggest trade partner is sweden , ca n't it become a problem as well ? 
  i guess though it is cheaper to sell to us now , so i guess the euro is good in that sense . 
  value chains cross borders , in case of finland and sweden our industrial value chains are highly linked with germany and the rest of the central europe . 
  even in case of sweden transaction costs are lowered for example when swedish company buys components/parts from germany and then sells them back to the eurozone , there is reduced transaction costs and lowered currency risk . 
   how ? 
  you have higher interest rates now than sweden , denmark , less control , have to borrow more and aid other countries more . 
  have n't your costs increased as well ? 
  the interest rates are a non-issue when they are this low . 
  when we talk about currency risk we talk about a sudden fall or surge of the value of currency , for example due to speculative attack that took boe out in the 90s . 
   i can understand being part of the eu , given finland 's history with russia , but how is finland more secure as a euromember , as opposed to a eu member ? 
  because with euro you have something valuable that you share and that you could all loose . 
  in case of the eu , what you share is a common market , something based on legislation and common will to work things out , in case of euro you have something that is very tangible . 
  but lets not loose the focus in here . 
  eu and euro are only parts of the finnish geopolitical security , they progress it , but real security is gained with deeper integration . 
  * lower transaction costs * reduced currency risks * increased geopolitical security, 
  driving license is not valid id document in the schengen area , only eu identity card or passport are valid documents to proof your identity . 
  there are two parties at fault in here ... * israel should restrain more of itself , maybe return to 1967 borders in exchange to permanent peace with all parties . 
  not to mention that they should really crack on hardliners . 
  * arab states and palestinians should stop institutinalized anti-semitism and accept losses . 
  most european countries in the last century have seen millions or tens of millions loose their homes and lands , and yet , that is all in the past . 
  people have moved on . 
  overall i do n't care . 
  you have too state centric view to the eurozone crisis . 
  the real solution to the crisis is to enable member states to go bankcrupt while shielding the banking and private sectors from the public meltdown . 
  to achieve this you need to open up the unlimited coffers of the ecb , but you ca n't do that without making treaty changes to increase the power of ecb . 
  pooling of debt on the other hand is not a solution and will not be suggested . 
  what europe needs is more market orientated policies and usually every treaty change has progressed them . 
  i really do n't see any large objections for further integration as the direction of integration will lower overall risks in the euroarea and does n't cost taxpayers directly . 
  not to mention that there will be another europe wide banking crisis in next ten years if ecb and the union does n't get more power , hint sepa is a really big thing in the future . 
  there definitely will be a treaty change , the problem is that ... * germany wants to include everybody , and thus wants to have eu treaty . 
  while the new treaty would make the union to have two tiers officially , it would n't exclude or put unnecessary obstacles for outside countries to join the core . 
  * however if germany ca n't include everybody , then there will be a new treaty , one of exclusion , one that only covers eurozone countries and will dive a wedge between the euroarea and non-euro countries . 
  this is more or less what france would want , a tighter but more deeper union where it would have more power than it currently has . 
  * for other eurozone states than germany or france i would guess that it is the same . 
  there are problems and those problems need to be fixed by deepening the union , and that calls for a new treaty . 
  it really does n't much is it eu or eurozone treaty , nobody else has any option than to follow . 
  now in case you are wondering why i am not talking about non-eurozone states is because they do n't matter . 
  if we have worst case scenario where economic situation calls for deeper union , but non-eurozone states prevent a new treaty , then we will have a situation where the rest of the union is more or less ejected to eea and the core goes on . 
  the thing is that we are talking about serious amounts of money in whole another ball park that we have seen in europe since the ww2 . 
  essentially we have left the good old days of integration by ideas and visions to hard ground of realpolitik , and that means whole new rules for integration . 
  representing both sides of the cold war equally would be the same as representing the nazi point of view in equal terms in berlin jewish museum . 
  there is no scientific proof that coal is harmful to the environment . 
  but there is scientific proof that nuclear causes deaths , just remember hiroshima and nagasaki !, 
  every time you use nuclear power , the government makes another nuclear bomb to destroy the world . 
  yours sincerely , your average green . 
  you ca n't use that as an excuse when ex-soviet satellites like the czech republic is fast reaching your gdp nominal per capita . 
  what about when ex-soviet republics like estonia reach your per capita levels ? 
  will you then claim that the soviets left estonia in much better condition than your dictatorship over 15 years before the ussr collapsed ? 
  let me ask few questions ... * are there any portuguese wind turbine and solar cell manufacturers ? 
  because the last time i checked the major corporations were from germany , china , etc. . * are there transmission capacity to actually transmit energy to faraway markets like france and germany ? 
  do you know by the way how much it actually costs to build up that capacity ? 
  the answer is very much . 
  i 'm sorry , but there is currently no money be made from renewable energy if you are n't the producer of actual equipment . 
  if someday renewable energy can compete without subsidies with other forms of power generation , then it makes sense to build facilities , but until then it is money thrown into wind . 
   there was no public debt problem before the crisis , no one is saying the country di n't had problems , but reckless spending was not one of them . 
  if there would n't have been property bubble , there would have been public debt problem , having a property bubble masked the funding shortage of the public sector . 
   the biggest problem portugal had the last 10 years was that it di n't manage to convert the advances it made on education , health , logistics , etc , into economic growth and wealth generation . 
  and whose problem is that ? 
   but like said before , keep on the ignorant hatred you have to the southern europe . 
  it is you who is all about hate . 
  it seems that any criticism towards policies that were in effect in southern countries is constructed as hate speech . 
  it more or less seems that everything was just a-okey , and then the big bad financial crisis came and ruined the fantastic paradises of south - there was nothing wrong internally in countries in question , it was all because bad international investors and foreign governments that caused the misfortune . 
  economic left/right : 2.38 social libertarian/authoritarian : -4.05, 
  because it is economically sensible . 
  in finland there is one new epr reactor being built by tvo , industry owned nuclear company . 
  the state has given them another permit to build another one beside it . 
  also the state has given permit to fennovoima , backed by e.on and industry , to build a nuclear plant to northern finland . 
  in sweden the state has given permission to replace current reactors with new ones - close one , get permit for one new . 
  currently one operator has started a process to get a permit to build new and close one old down . 
  the reason why some countries like germany are phasing out their nuclear power plants is because no politician has been man enough to say the trueth to the electorate , which is that without cheap energy european countries will go bust . 
  as that is the real deal , it is now wonder that new coal plants are build in germany . 
  i really ca n't see that building new coal plants is a solution , in here thanks to nuclear , power companies are facing coal out . 
  i have ussr branded pocket flask . 
  there is no more greater justice than having all communist symbols and items become part of consumer based capitalistic lifestyle . 
  did you by the way know that the image of che is copyrighted and it is being actively sold for merchandise producers ? 
  ai n't that cool . 
  finally che can be part of the triumph of capitalism . 
  which itself really was n't that much . 
  introduction of capitalism is in the list of things to do ? 
   perhaps the best way for the government to create jobs would be to invest in wind and solar energy , which would reduce energy spending . 
  wind and solar are money sinks . 
  the only reason why germany and denmark have been so eager to give subsidies to build renewable energy is because their domestic companies have largely benefited from them . 
  wind mills are products of metalworking and machine industries . 
  solar cells are products of material and process industries . 
  if you do n't have companies specialised on these products , it is total waste of money to invest in them , money just either goes to germany or china . 
  much better idea to produce energy is to build nuclear plants . 
  while they usually have to be ordered from outside the country in question , they produce so cheap electricity that it soon makes it all up . 
   anyway portugal was n't communist and did n't have much of those either . 
  that does n't make the case any better for portugal . 
  but hey , is czech republic communist enough ? 
  their gdp nominal per capita in 2011 was 20,444 usd , almost the same as portugal 's 22,413 .

  this has everything to do with housing and relocation policy rather than failure to integrate and/or amount of immigrants . 
  we do it right in finland . 
  they get relocated all around the country to prevent ghettoisation . 
  similar to how high income and low income housing are mixed in the same areas . 
  if sweden just sent them everywhere instead of giving an entire city block of housing to immigrants this problem would have been avoided from the get go .

  i dont understand how, 
  i like the way you think about travelling .

  surely they had other models to offer also, 
  do n't know about the sanctions but huge players like india , china and russia do n't like to buy from america . . hell they could n't even get brazil to buy their military jets , canada is backing down etc. 
  well if i had to choose one . 
  also politically many big buyers prefer airbus . 
   our current reserve is +900 000 people . 
  the same number for ukraine , is 700 000 . 
  do n't lie , finnish military is only 230k . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/finnish_defence_forces iraq had 1,15 million troops and reservists , absolutely no match against usa . 
  coalition had only < 200k in the invasion . 
  with simultaneous air and ground assaults they destroyed that big finnish style mass army almost without own casualties . 
   so have technology and tactics for defending places , as well . 
  there 's nothing stopping russia from landing their troops to helsinki ? 
  how about some anti-aircraft . 
  you mean anti-aircraft guns ? 
  well those do n't help against submarines , ships and missiles . 
  americans were able to cripple iraq 's air defences with no problem . 
  also anti-radar missiles are cool   that is just fundamentally wrong . 
  yes , russia would use some of their world class special forces units and airborne troops to conquer cities . 
  but in order to move armor and massive amounts of troops , you still got ta march through that thick forest . 
  try to understand that . 
  no you do n't , i 'm pretty sure russia has something similar to marines and even the current setup of their baltic fleet includes amphibious ships  so you have fun in your `` thick forest '' while ruskies are raiding alkos on the west coast . 
  also they do n't need to `` conquer '' that many cities as there are basically one that counts . 
   according to wikipedia , the u.s.a led coalition ( they did n't fight alone , mind you ) had 309 000 troops , and the opposing iraq army had 375 000 men . 
  hardly twice as less , mate . 
  sorry but i think you have trouble with comprehending english , mate . 
  iraqi army had close to 1,2 million soldiers when you count reservists like you did regarding finland :p also i was talking about the actual invasion . 
  that usa did pretty much alone and nowhere near 375k troops participated . 
  later other forces like kurds joined but this was in the occupation stage . 
   we actually do have some . 
  plus if you have been through military service , you 'd know they teach us to dig trenches and foxholes on a massive scale . 
  well you do n't have anything that can be used in actual fighting . 
  some depots are underground yes , but those wo n't help you to kill ruskies . 
  i really do n't care what they teach you to do when the fact is that ww2 style war will never happen again . 
  at least if you really think that all the men would go away to karelia to wage war :d  again , foxholes are great at preventing that . 
  have you studied anything , or are you just saying things ? 
  :d ahahah you do n't even know what a cluster bomb is . 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94rkrwduuok you and your friends would be dead as hell if a strike like that hit your puny holes . 
   that 's neat . 
  if you 'd be called to the front and you run away , be prepared for a shit ton of jail time . 
  do you honestly think finland 's government would just forget about the people who ran away ? 
  they 'd haul your ass back here ( even years after the war ) and you 'd face +4 years of jail time . 
  probably worth it , tho . 
  well given that `` the front '' could be at senaatintori i do n't really care . 
  there 's no legistlation in finland to warrant jail time for not volunteering to die , that 's some right wing bullshit wet dream . 
  you are lying , pathetic . 
  i feel sorry for poor , uneducated fuck like you . 
  in modern war you do n't `` declare war '' and march to other country with your army :d just look what happened in ukraine . 
  russia took crimea without single shot fired regardless of the fact that ukraine has bigger army than finland . 
  technology and tactics have both changed . 
  there 's nothing that could stop russia landing their troops directly to helsinki . 
  you are delusional if you think that wars nowadays are fought in forests far away urban areas . 
  you have fun in your foxhole in karelia while ruskies detain the whole government in helsinki :d i 'm of course drinking coctails somewhere in bermuda :p `` the core '' , whatever that 's supposed to mean , is n't `` the same '' . 
  usa absolutely destroyed iraqi army twice with less combat troops . 
  according to your stone age playbook this should n't be possible as `` defender needs only 1/3 of the manpower '' right ? 
  finland does n't have a network of bunkers . 
  also if russia has anything comparable to american bunker busters , they would be obsolete anyways . 
  also let 's see how you survive in your hole against some cluster bombing ( finland has no cabability to prevent that )  btw . 
  in ` nam american losses were nothing compared to vietkong 's . 
  that war was ended on purely political reasons , not because south vietnam/america/australia suffered a military defeat . 
  indeed . 
  kotiryss\u00e4 was also a succesful tactic . 
  well did n't obama force saudi arabia to make a huge purchase from boeing ? 
  also boeing gets huge amount of state aid . 
  so there 's no reason to point out that `` airbus is owned by governments '' as it is a very much profitable company . 
  airbus is still clearly bigger when you compare amount of units sold : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/competition_between_airbus_and_boeing#orders_and_deliveries, 
  i 'm sorry but america ca n't really make stuff anymore . 
  it really bugs me that we allow shit holes like ireland and luxemburg to pull their shit inside of the union ... 
  scary place . 
  it 's funny how in my country every single paper and decision is public, 
  well they still sell more planes than boeing . 
  no one cares about the 60s in 2016 , sorry . 
  well if they really can do that, 
  is n't your country filled with migrants ? 
  keep in mind that this individual does n't speak english almost at all . 
  so maybe something was lost in translation, 
  are you telling me you ca n't find a wife who cooks for you ? 
  no it does n't sound nuts . 
  this is russia that we are talking about . 
  that 's what you get when you vote for merkel !, 
  but wait !, 
  is n't it so that germany 's leader is n't even directly voted for ? 
  umm no . 
  they ca n't force eu companies to comply even if their owners are in usa . 
  no it 's you who are lying . 
  your link does n't even discuss that . 
  de facto nato support is over 50 % in finland, 
  propaganda is important to keep that shithole from falling apart, 
  that 's not how it works in modern war anymore . 
  you are a victim of leftist propaganda . 
  sorry but airbus kicks boeings ass nowadays . 
  boeing could n't even make a new jumbo . 
  they would n't exist anymore if your government was n't so hungry for weapons they make, 
  so are you admitting that usa is actually no better than russia and there are no rule of law ? 
  just use non american clouds and the problem is solved, 
  well that 's not how law works in europe . 
  usa has absolutely no power over european registered companies . 
  speak for yourself . 
  `` old '' people can be very `` savvy '' . 
  finland gets a lot of them already, 
  50 persons a week is nothing compared to how many came from sweden and germany .

  `` se '' is very easy . 
  in spoken language it 's used about everything `` i ordered a pizza , * it will come within a half an hour * '' in spoken finnish would be * `` se tulee puolessa tunnissa '' * . 
  `` i called her , * she will come within a half an hour * '' in spoken finnish would be * `` se tulee puolessa tunnissa '' * . 
  and `` i called the doctor ( gender unknown ) . 
  * he/she will come within a half an hour * '' in spoken finnish would be * `` se tulee puolessa tunnissa '' *, 
  because as someone who naturally uses gender neutral pronouns in native language , i have noticed the benefits as compared to when writing english . 
  so i do see a point with the word , so i do understand the suggestion to extent i could see myself using it in sweden , so your stance that you refuse to take me seriously either because of some other people you do n't like seems rather extreme and fundamentalist . 
  so you oppose anything they suggest , just because who they are , not on the merits of their suggestion itself ? 
  like it does not even matter if the suggestion itself is good , you just want to shoot down every suggestion they make ? 
  there 's a finnish comedy sketch about your attitude . 
  you look how the people you do n't like think , and you take the opposite stance . 
  that way you do n't have to think yourself , you just disagree with the ones you do n't like . 
  it 's `` externalizing your thinking to idiots '' . 
  gender neutral pronouns do have merits , as finnish has , so there 's nothing wrong to advance the use of them . 
  languages have always seen some artificial control and these things start by not being established . 
  what 's the harm in it ? 
  finnish for example uses the similar pronounced gender neutral `` h\u00e4n '' or more broadly , even living/non-living neutral `` se '' to refer people . 
  you can refer to a trash can and you grandmother with the same pronoun in finnish . 
  you refuse to take finnish language seriously ? 
  i 've heard they were also influenced by neighboring finnish ( which is also a minority language in sweden ) , which has very similarly pronounced `` h\u00e4n '' as a gender neutral pronoun ( as gender pronouns do n't exist in finnish ) . 
  calling people as `` se '' is not grammatically correct * written * finnish , but it is grammatically correct * spoken * finnish . 
  and languages are primarily a spoken phenomena . 
  speech is the primary form of existence of languages , and written languages just reflect the actual language . 
  this is why we consider languages which are no longer spoken to be dead languages . 
  written finnish is a somewhat artificial construct which no one really speaks . 
  it is meant to be a neutral formal language for writing and extremely formal situations . 
  it is not meant to replace the spoken language . 
  when you are describing the grammar of spoken language , you ignore the grammar of written language . 
  you can not say the grammar of spoken language is `` wrong '' because it differs from the written grammar . 
  so , in the actual spoken language , `` se '' means `` he/she/it '' and makes no distinction is the subject a person or a non-person . 
  in spoken language `` se tulee maanantaina '' , without additional information , could be understood as `` he/she/it will arrive on monday '' , so one might be speaking about a person or a mail order . 
  `` se '' as an umbrella term for persons and non-persons has been a part of spoken finnish even before written finnish was created . 
  i 'd note that `` se '' in spoken finnish does not mean only `` it '' . 
  in spoken everyday finnish `` se '' is an umbrella word meaning `` it/he/she '' and it has always been . 
  only in formal written finnish does `` se '' have the sole meaning of `` it '' . 
  many finns do not seem to grasp that spoken finnish has different rules and grammar of its own , separate from written finnish , and many use solely the grammar of written formal finnish to describe how spoken finnish is used . 
  that 's why many finns tend to describe that we refer to people as `` it '' while in truth in spoken language the word `` se '' does not make a distinction are you speaking about he , she or it . 
  that distinction only exist in the somewhat artificial and formal written finnish , and it can not be used to describe spoken finnish , which can be considerably different from written finnish . 
  `` se '' translates to `` it '' only from formal written finnish . 
  in spoken everyday finnish it has always meant `` he/she/it '' . 
  so when translating spoken finnish reference to wife , `` se on tuolla '' the correct translation would be `` she is over there '' , not `` it is over there '' . 
  yea * suomenruotsalainen * literally means `` swede of/in finland '' but since i have swedish speaking relatives , i have lived in substantially swedish speaking areas and know swedish speaking finns and some of my friends are `` just finns '' merely because their swedish speaking parents decided to speak finnish instead of swedish to them as kids , i have habituated to understand the * ruotsalainen * or `` swede '' in * suomenruotsalainen * to mean just language , completely independent of swedish ethnicity . 
  like my swedish speaking cousins are like `` fuck you sweden ! '', 
  when finland loses to sweden in ice hockey . 
  i kind of like that fashion photo shoot for that reason . 
  it really tries and accomplishes portraying the elitist rich fashion cliches about swedish speaking finns . 
  here 's another one : http://hs11.snstatic.fi/webkuva/taysi/560/1305820877095?ts=691, 
  i doubt they will . 
  center party does not have that vocal opposition to the law , even though i think majority of them were against it , so i doubt they make it an issue in cabinet negotiations like christian democrats made . 
  a cabinet of center party , finns and christian democrats ( which in theory could be quite anti-lgbt rights ) would be a minority government , so they need a pro-lgbt rights party in the cabinet . 
  all the other parties already have an official stance to support the same sex marriage . 
  in practice the cabinet negotiations would be kind of reverse of the last cabinet negotiations . 
  coalition party needed a strong majority government , so they needed the christian democrats , and their ultimatum was that the government will not make an initiative for same sex marriage . 
  in the next cabinet negotiations , the other parties can make an ultimatum for the center party that the government will not block the citizen initiative . 
  so there would be no government support to blocking the initiative . 
  in theory , the parliament could still vote to block the initiative , just like the initiative was voted for in the first place . 
  blocking the law would demand a new initiative , and it could not come from the government . 
  so it would need to come from individual member of the parliament or a citizen initiative . 
  initiatives from individual representatives have a very low chance of succeeding . 
  this happened to the same sex marriage initiative made by stubb during our current parliament . 
  it got buried in the parliamentary committees under the government initiatives , and it was never voted in the parliament . 
  citizen initiative would again need 50 000 names in 6 months , which is unlikely . 
  if the issue came into vote , for the parliament to retract the initiative would demand that majority of the given votes are against same sex marriage , which seems unlikely considering the parliament gets more liberal with every elections , and blocking an already approved citizen initiative is quite bad pr on an issue that is not an important issue for the majority of finns . 
  also interestingly , true finns have also started downplaying their attitudes towards immigration , which i see as kind of softening their stances to make it easier to get into the government . 
  `` sjw '' policies are strongly associated with socialist policies if not an important part part of them . 
  the underlying principles in left and socialist policies are the opposition of social hierarchies and support for social equality and solidarity . 
  in economics , this turns into opposition of rule of capitalistic class in the expense of working class , but in other areas , it turns into opposition against the rule of men in the expense of women , against the rule of heterosexuals in the expense of sexual minorities , against the rule of white in the expense of non-whites and so on . 
  at that time , conservatives easily could have dismissed them as `` social justice warriors '' but now , a hundred years later we consider universal suffrage and equality in education and work self evident . 
  [ here 's a better photo ] ( http://hs13.snstatic.fi/webkuva/taysi/1920/1305820877141?ts=264 ) . 
  to expand : in 2011 we had presidential elections . 
  every party has a candidate , and if not one of the candidates gets over 50 % of votes , there will be a second round . 
  in the first round sauli niinist\u00f6 of the coalition party got most votes but under 50 % and the green candidate pekka haavisto , who is openly homosexual and campaigned [ with his partner ] ( http://is12.snstatic.fi/img/978/1288510790923.jpg ) got the second most votes . 
  so in the second round the presidential candidates were sauli niinist\u00f6 and pekka haavisto . 
  while niinist\u00f6 won with numbers like 65 % vs. 35 % , i think it was very surprising that in the first round a green openly homosexual candidate with an ecuadorian hairdresser as a partner surpassed the candidates major parties like basic finns , social democrats and the center party . 
  i did n't think finns were that tolerant , but i guess having a female president for 12 years have shifted the attitudes , as when she was elected we had a discussion `` can we have a woman as a president ? '', 
  she ended up being one of the most liked president of history at that point . 
  otherwise i also think the situation is quite good . 
  civil partnership was introduced in 2002 and it has almost the same rights as marriage . 
  internal adoption is allowed , so you can adopt your partners child . 
  single gays are also allowed to adopt . 
  the legislation currently limits the adoption right for couples only to married couples ( meaning unmarried straight couples can not adopt jointly either ) . 
  most of finns support same sex marriage and adoption rights . 
  however in the parliament the government cabinet party christian democrats have effectively barred the government of making initiative for same sex marriage and adoption . 
  so in 2013 a citizen initiative was made , and it got 100 000 signatures in one day , whereas the requirement is 50 000 names in 6 months . 
  conservatives in the parliament tried to block it , but in the end parliament voted to approve the initiative . 
  it will come in force the latest 2017 , as before that the parliament must change all other legislation to get rest of the laws in sync with the new marriage law . 
  like probably in every other country , in smaller rural areas the attitudes are of course more conservative , but in general the attitudes have changed a lot in 15 years . 
  to me it seems that many people who had the attitude '' * why are the gays so political , why ca n't gays just keep things to themselves * '' have shifted more to '' * i do n't really care , it 's none of my business , but i guess there 's no harm in equal rights , whatever * '' . 
  i have no idea about individual houses , but in apartment buildings it 's generally included in the rent / general maintenance charge , so it 's not priced according to use . 
  sometimes it 's can be separate fixed cost , was like 15 $ / month in one otherwise cheap flat i used to live in . 
  it was built by a private obscenely rich merchant for himself . 
  the tsar bought the building to be his palace in finland . 
   not sure emotions it 's not * show * emotions . 
  and `` finland '' originally was the southwestern area of modern finland . 
  now known as `` finland proper '' . 
  sweden/sverige in finnish = ruotsi . 
  comes from roslagen , the area north of stockholm , which is fairly close to finland . 
  roslagen is also speculated to give russia its name , as in germanic settlers from roslagen settled into russia . 
  russia in finnish is `` ven\u00e4j\u00e4 '' . 
  sex slaves ?

  from what i recall you can influence the decision based on travel and special studying differences ( for example , swedish schools ) . 
  this all probably changes when you go to rural areas !, 
  i imagine there are n't a lot of schools that you can choose from . 
  you have a good point but that point you are making makes arguing about anything futile in my opinion . 
  if what you are saying is true then he just did nothing else than state his opinion out loud . 
  he did n't argue it any further . 
  i might be moving the goalposts here . 
   it depends on his opinion on what marriage is supposed to be , what your opinions are on the matter is n't some universal truth you know . 
  it is not about the topic of the argument i was pointing out . 
  it was the way he defended his position which was laughable . 
  i do n't judge politicians by `` how much they agree with me '' but by how they argue their stance . 
  if you ca n't argue your stance in the parliament of a democratic country as a member of said parliament of all places then i think you are not a good politician . 
  if you use 7th grader argumentation then you are not a good politician in my eyes . 
   if marriage is supposed to be according to him a state between a man and a woman , then there can literally not exist gay marriage and his statement is completely reasonable . 
  i heard many good arguments against the equal marriage law ( for example that the state should only register two people as married and that 's it , they should leave all the rest to the church the couple are members of , or that this law will force pastors to marry people they do n't agree with and be labeled as discriminating people ) and mr. hakkarainen 's argument was by far one of the worst if not * the * worst . 
  i do not know if you are finnish or not but finland passed same sex `` marriage '' in 2002 but this was called a civil union and it lacked rights heterosexual marriages had : inheritance and adoption for example . 
  this law just finalized and made ( will make in 2017 iirc ) civil unions just ordinary marriages instead of marriage lite . 
  no it 's about a man who 's argument against gay marriage was `` you ca n't make a law that makes the sun rise from the west '' and so you should n't pass a law that allows equal marriage laws to homosexual couples . 
  that is literally 7th grade argumentation and you are running a country , not some online chat room . 
  he is acting like kimi inside his head . 
  `` brrrmmmmmm brmmmm '', 
  managed to defend itself from italy ( with help from italy 's competitors ) and people backed off : http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/first_italo-ethiopian_war, 
  i would have added `` now i am a soldier , so that others can be what they want '' , because that 's what protecting freedom is about . 
  this is true . 
  not everyone who leaves for syria actually went to fight . 
  it is only logical . 
  yea that 's why i said what i said . 
  have n't seen it used so much so it does n't have credibility . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/horseshoe_theory i admit i should n't really use this in a convo , because i can only speak 2 or 3 sentences about this `` theory '' . 
  the day they do n't they stop getting soldiers . 
  one of the ways to make people do this kind of shit is to start them young . 
  i bet most of the people leading isis and other terror groups were born into jihadism ( like afghans vs. soviets , israel vs. the arabs ) . 
  really fucking sick . 
  i remember people buying beers by the pairs at 7 am . 
  i was at the bar getting coffee , and apparently some people prefer long drinks for waking up . 
  i wonder of the flight has decreased after people * really * found out how they were carrying out this vision of an islamic state . 
  during it 's time of declararion it really looked attractive to people . 
  they advertised it as some kind of sharia theme park . 
  now that more and more things come out i wonder how many moderate-leaning people still went ? 
  i think that the only group of people finns hate more than immigrants , refugees ... ** anything ** are the russian government . 
  some of that might be all those environmental attacks . 
  while they are extreme forms of protests , destroying and damaging property that belongs to companies accused of ruining the local environment must total to a large sum . 
  mmmm ... lax ... 
  aka `` the mujahideen approach '' . 
  that just means you ca n't let loose without it . 
  i can dance for hours without any alcohol in my system . 
  my friends just bring me down because they are acting too self consciuous . 
  you are free to call them idiots . 
  it is short-sighted though . 
  calling someone and idiot is dismissing the reason why they are acting like * idiots * . 
  i could call a woman who ca n't leave her violent boyfriend an idiot , but then i would have no idea why that woman is acting irrationally and pretty much self-destructively by staying with him . 
  it 's a cult , man . 
  it 's both sad and scary at the same time . 
  i 'm not equating the two , but scientology is one of the few organizations that know mind control extremely well . 
  there are certain methods that cults use , naturally or learned , that help people make irrational decisions . 
  like i said to a commenter above , somewhat good examples are pyramid schemes ( multi-level marketing ) or even abusive relationships . 
  how many times have you heard of people falling for pyramid schemes ? 
  or unable to get out of abusive relationships ? 
  some people know damn well , again -- by learning or just naturally , how to make people make completely irrational decisions . 
  i watched an interview about cults , and the guest was a cult expert . 
  one of the things that stuck with me was that you should not call people who are victims of cults `` idiots '' . 
  people who are lured by cults are not thinking rationally anyway . 
  the easiest way to see this is by going to a pyramid scheme event or talking to someone who is a member of one . 
  they are irrational even in the face of pretty compelling evidence . 
  i 'm not excusing her behavior . 
  it 's just that isis recruitment is a lot like ( or is exactly like ) cult recruitment , which is extremely efficient at making people comply and disregard common sense . 
  i clearly remember reading an article where they said that it was n't funny anymore . 
  i remember it because it was posted here and people misinterpreted the article 's title without reading what they actually said . 
  this is probably the same person , who when charlie hebdo themselves said `` we kept beating the dead horse , we'er not doing muhammad comics for a while '' , got riled up and thought ch were giving up . 
  this guy must live in an alternate europe if he thinks that most people `` failed '' their so called test . 
  many countries of the west are inherently liberal compared to the majority of the world . 
  what this person generalizes europe with is the very left of the already left-wing people . 
  i guess he scored a point since i read his article , though . 
  contrary to popular belief , not all whites , asians , africans , etc. 
  look all the same . 
  if conscription is not your thing i did mentioned the possibility of using other kinds of trials . 
  conscription is just the easiest one ( and i 'm biased since i 'm from finland ) since lots of countries have a military and * just a camping trip * would probably not be enough so that young people would take the trial seriously . 
  if a camping trip teaches you how to maneuver towards defensive positions where you will meet an enemy , that would make the trial a lot more . 
   then conscription would only serve to make an illusion that you 're a `` proper adult '' , after completing it . 
  that 's you opinion . 
  however i think that only people who are ready for adulthood and adult responsibilities should be able to know how to kill or capture a person , which the army teaches . 
  because school is about getting knowledgeand getting a diploma showing that you have the said knowledge . 
  as i said it might not work for everyone as you have been going to school for 11 years and gotten at least 3 diplomas . 
  the only bodily exertion getting a diploma needs is staying awake and trying to finish essays before a deadline . 
  going through military training is about both the body and the mind . 
  if and when you complete it you are part of the people who are ready to defend all your rights and your countrymen . 
  if you 've seen any coming of age rituals from peoples all around the world it 's a combination of overcoming barriers in your head that would never be tested in a comfy life . 
  once you show that you can complete the task and show that you have grown , you are celebrated as a new man/woman . 
  conscription is the easiest one to do in a modern society imo but it can be non-military and all about survival . 
  i ca n't / do n't have time to explain this in many other ways . 
  if you do n't agree then it 's fine , we just have different opinions . 
  that stuff in the military is designed to train you to sit in the cold trenches without losing your mind . 
  war is a lot of sitting and waiting and a lot of fearing for your life . 
  any mental toughness thatyour life and training has given you will be useful . 
  it most likely is n't . 
  the mundane , repetetive and annoying stuff is something that builds you up , whether it is in the military or not . 
  that 's just my opinion though . 
   you 're romanticizing conscription . 
  i very much am in my opinion . 
  half of me is telling me to just stay home .

  i 'd like to know who the `` some '' are the media is quoting . 
  oddly , this [ bbc article ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-35425735 ) finishes with exactly the same two paragraphs :  in neighbouring denmark , meanwhile , the government this week approved legislation to seize the valuables of refugees in the hope of limiting the influx of migrants . 
   some have likened the danish proposals to the confiscation of gold and other valuables from jews by the nazis during the holocaust . 
  it has n't been made clear who originally made this comparison that many media sources quote . 
  personally , i generally have liked guardian 's reporting ( except for some of their rabid op-ed pieces ) but their stuff on the eu migrant crisis seems to be really off - edit : [ here 's a screenshot ] ( http://i.imgur.com/htvnhke.png ) in case the one who copied the other decides to alter their article . 
  it 's now on bbc : http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-35425735, 
  i might have . 
  like i said , those were `` related '' pages from the rotherham wiki . 
  yeah , you 'd think those other cases would have been reported even here in finland , but if they are not even covered locally ... 
  similar apologism is prevalent is in other countries , too . 
  [ the swedish police ca n't even mention criminals ethnicity anymore ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/swedish-police-are-not-allowed-to-give-descriptions-of-alleged-criminals-so-as-not-to-sound-racist-a6810311.html ) and they do n't have any published statistics on how many criminals are foreigners . 
  all in fear of sounding racist . 
  it 's not quite as bad in finland , but there 's still a good amount of whitewash and blame to go around towards the original population . 
  it 's absurd . 
  this whole thing is absolutely unreal . 
  i 'd read about the rotherham gang before , but had no idea that there are many more similar child molester gangs where all perpetrators are muslims or of muslim heritage , and all the victims are white . 
  just related links from the rotherham gang wiki : * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rochdale_sex_trafficking_gang * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/derby_sex_gang * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/oxford_sex_gang * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bristol_sex_gang * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/telford_sex_gang * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/peterborough_sex_abuse_case * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/aylesbury_sex_gang * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/keighley_sex_gang,

  country names in the grand ole opry . 
  gud point . 
  i suspect that this is one of the main reasons for lower numbers in germany , italy , spain etc. 
  certainly possible . 
  also , swedish is compulsory for finnish speakers ( and finnish for swedish speakers ) , and those who choose it as their first language , start english ( or some other language ) a year ( or two ? ), 
  later . 
  although i believe that around 90 % of finns start with english as their first foreign language . 
  i just find norway 's 90 % a bit dubious . 
  i 'd like to know how the survey was done . 
  thanks , that was interesting . 
  the answer to the question of why 75 % of all the world 's mining operations are based in canada :  `` there 's two sides to it , '' he said . 
  `` one is that there is a concentration of expertise in mining finance and mining law , it does have a historical basis '' he is of course referring to the various canadian gold rushes , the nickel deposits in sudbury , coal in cape breton , etc. 
  `` the other side is that canada provides very favourable conditions . 
  the listing requirements for the tsx [ toronto stock exchange ] are pretty lax , the disclosure requirements are pretty lax , you do n't have to have canadian directories or canadian shareholders to be a canadian company ... and the canadian government does n't ask too many questions about whether you 're paying your taxes in other jurisdictions ( i.e. 
  foreign countries where the mines are operating ) . '', 
  yeah , me too . 
  especially the 16 and 20 point difference to sweden and norway was rather surprising . 
  i wonder what the methodology in the survey was . 
  if it was by self-evaluation , i would n't be at all surprised if the finns would generally downplay their english skills . 
  why not make a sauna set . 
  i mean a real , working sauna set . 
  as much as i like [ the futuro house ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/futuro ) , its shape and curves do n't translate well in lego \u00ae . 
  that was interesting clip ( despite the poorly chosen soundtrack ) !, 
  conversely , i 've been little baffled a few times when in literature a person is described as `` black irish '' . 
  my first impressions were often something like phil lynott , which often clashed with the narrative . 
  then i learned that the term can also refer to a dark-haired ( sometimes with darker complexion ) irish phenotype . 
  yeah , we are few . 
  lot of empty space on our land . 
  denmark and norway have populations of similar numbers ( 5-6m ) . 
  if you 'd ever heard about finland , i bet you would tolerate us slightly . 
  might very well be . 
  thanks for the correction !, 
  right , thanks . 
  a misremeberance , for some reason . 
  it 's fairly similar to ireland , actually . 
  helsinki and dublin have both roughly 1-1 ,5 m people ( urban areas , not just municipality ) . 
  we have two cities ( turku and tampere ) that are little bigger than your second city , cork . 
  your country has a million or so ~ ~ more ~ ~ fewer inhabitants but finland [ is much bigger in size ] ( http://i.imgur.com/zajazlk.png ) , which means we have very sparsely populated areas . 
  they do n't even have to be drunk : https://youtu.be/cb2ncqfppsy?t=1m32s ( harry and paul ), 
  well said , and i agree . 
  it 's pretty much same deluded narrative in my country ( although we have the greens bundled in with the left as red-greens ) . 
  this false dichotomy hinders us dealing with the problem . 
  a good and well-rounded article . 
  recommended !, 
  yeah , i know . 
  i just posted it because i realised that my favourite pipe tobacco is kind of bruno st. really do n't like your cheese , though . 
  i heard it [ burns ] ( http://i.imgur.com/dxif82y.jpg ) well . 
  cheese is in huge demand over there . 
  here 's [ some footage . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koyqbsmeihm ), 
  well , the evidence certainly points that way . 
  could n't have been norwegians , their favourite cheese is not actual cheese at all . 
  [ cctv still of the thieves . 
  i thought he was talking about vice `` reporters '' . 
  thanks for the insightful comment . 
  the headline sounded absurd to me . 
  what an intriguing story !, 
  it reminded me of another serial imposter , [ fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric bourdin ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fr%c3%a9d%c3%a9ric_bourdin ) . 
  there 's [ a fantastic article on him \\ ( new yorker , again \\ ) form 2008 ] ( http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2008/08/11/the-chameleon-2 ) .

  finland googeled spurdo sp\u00e4rde the most !, 
  just kidding , they googled that fatass kardashian . 
  and so did estonia , but interestingly latvia googled vladimir putin the most . 
  i do n't what to think about that . 
  what should i think ? 
  right , right . 
  i get it now . 
  sort of like the black panthers , except not even close .

  does anyone have any idea what would have happened if more than 50 % had voted no ? 
  what does that mean ? 
  there is only one party , and you can vote yes for the party or no for the party ? 
   we ( slovaks and czechs ) had elections , just that there was only one political party . 
  so what was voting like ? 
  could you still choose which candidate to vote ? 
  dinosaurs had eggs , no ? 
  build a wall around stockholm and make stockholmare pay for it . 
  clinton would continue to keep europe safe with us military presence , against europeans ' complaints opposing the us military presence in europe . 
  this is was europeans want . 
  trump might do what europeans have long said they want : withdraw us military presence in europe . 
  this is not what europeans want . 
  step 3 : no communists . 
   western swedes , eastern swedes , why do n't you guys unite into empire again ? 
  because then we 'd have to be in the same empire with the swedes , probably even ruled by them . 
  now , a dane-finno-norwegian empire i could get behind . 
  it might look a bit funny on the map , though . 
   the article 's claim is that second language speakers understand each other better than they understand natives . 
  here 's who i understand most easily : 1 . 
  americans 2 . 
  second language speakers without strong accent 3 . 
  second language speakers with strong but easy accent , like nordics , german , spanish , indian 3 . 
  british 4 . 
  second language speakers with strong and difficult accent , like russian , chinese 5 . 
  strong french accent 6 . 
  strong scottish accent, 
   hardly ever see them in the us . 
  here in the us east coast , all supermarkets have them, 
  sure . 
  just google some instructions . 
  it will take 3-5 years before you get your first fruit . 
  ok , so if i eventually understand them , after having asked a couple of times for them to repeat slower and clearer , then it must have been scottish dialect . 
  if it was the scots language , i would not have understood them at all . 
  how do you tell the difference ? 
  the most difficult english accent i have encountered was in northern scotland . 
  compared to that , russian , french , chinese , polish , indian , whatever , have been easier to understand . 
   polish and ukrainian are related languages . 
  from our ( finland ) point of view , all indo-european languages are related . 
  i remember a cashier in germany , in student cafeteria at leipzig university , who not only did n't speak any english , but also did n't seem to comprehend that a foreigner does not understand her when she tries to explain something in german . 
  or perhaps she just did n't give a shit . 
    ( how the fuck am i supposed to read german while listening english ? ) . 
    quite easily . 
  all the blue countries manage to do just that . 
  to be honest , when you reach the level where you understand almost all of spoken english in movies , the subtitles can get annoying if you disagree with the translations . 
  watching the movie is distracted by getting angry on how bad a job the translator did . 
  so in portugal you never get bored of eating salted cod ? 
   nobody makes fun of us like we do . 
  do you mostly joke about italians in general , or the people in other provinces of italy ? 
  the mutual pairs : * spain - portugal * uk - ireland * czechia - slovakia * ukraine - russia, 
  so basically it depends on how well a 10-year old boy is able to explain his story , whether it will be a rape or not ? 
  what if someone rapes a disabled child who can not speak in a coherent manner ? 
  will that ever be a rape ? 
  so as long as you rape a child in an isolated place ( like , a closed room ) so that there are no witnesses , and you do n't leave physical injuries ( like bruises ) , it can almost never be a rape ? 
  do you think the court was exceptionally careless , and this is why it is going to retrial ? 
  or is the legal system such that it is normally nearly impossibly to legally prove that a child was raped , thus normally almost all rape cases will only be convicted as sexual abuse ? 
  it is an interesting viewpoint that an adult can have sex with a 10-year old child without it being a rape . 
  and even further , if anyone who commits the crime of having sex with a child can then claim that it was n't a rape , it is an even more interesting viewpoint that in austria then the crime of raping a child pretty much does n't exist , all such acts can only be convicted as sexual abuse . 
  norway , we are sorry we made such fun of your delicate doping situation . 
  please reconsider .

   how many refugee shelters are there in poland ? 
  according to this [ article in the guardian ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/may/13/ukraines-refugees-find-solace-in-poland-europes-most-homogenous-society ) , the 300 000 -- 400 000 war refugees that poland took , were not put into refugee shelters , but they were given work permits and they are more or less integrated into the society .

   only 5 % of bailout money went to greece 's state & people you do n't understand what taking a loan means , and what a bailout means . 
  the bailout went to pay greece 's loans , because greece could n't pay them . 
  so yes , the money went to the banks who had given greece money , but greece had already got ( and spent ) that money years earlier when they took the loans .

hey , just be happy we do n't spell it reval ... / s, 
   just out of curiosity , do you have an opinion on why folks in , say , poland , would n't go in for clothes dryers ? 
  the noise produced , the initial cost , the electrical cost of operation , the fact that they tend to put stress on clothes and reduce their lifetime ( though they do make for fluffier , softer clothes ... my few experiences with line-dried clothes have been that they are stiff ) ? 
  widespread use of clothing types ( e.g. 
  natural wool ) that are not particularly dryer-friendly ? 
  we actually have a tumble dryer , but we very seldom use it . 
  all the things you mentioned above , plus you have to de-lint it and stuff . 
  we mostly only use it if we need something dry quickly , or to get hairs and lint out of things ( originally bought it when we had a dog ) . 
  and it 's convenient for things like big sheets that are hard to hang when they are wet if you are alone . 
  i think dryers are pretty common in finland , though . 
  what i really would like , if they were available and not horribly expensive , is what we had when i was a child in the 70-ies : an electric drying cupboard . 
  it is basically a metal cabinet with a small heater and a fan . 
  we actually have an old one that is no longer works , and we keep it just because it is a darned convenient design for hanging loads of stuff in a small space . 
  was n't there an exchange of roughly a million ( + - a couple hundred thousand ) people between czechoslovakia and hungary as well ? 
  this is really interesting re the tomatoes , because spain must also produce quite tasty varieties : there 's one chain in finland where the cheap store brand spanish cherry/plum/cocktail tomatoes are nearly always good and flavourful . 
  it 's really quite weird because other chains also have cheap spanish mini-tomatoes , but only this one particular store brand is 85 % reliably tasty . 
  and you can usually see/smell if the current batch in a shop is of the good variety . 
  indeed . 
  this attitude is what i find most troubling when it comes to the swedish `` humanitarian superpower '' - stance . 
  a deeply racist expectation that everyone at heart wants to be rescued by the noble swedish system , but are basically savages that ca n't help them selves unless treated like retarded kindergartners . 
  was n't the news a year ago ( or more ? 
  or less ? 
  my memory is bad ) that ups and other courier/package deliveries wo n't deliver to certain post codes ? 
  because of safety concerns . 
  iirc it did n't make any waves in normal swedish media , but as a finn i was deeply shocked . 
  * our * ideas ? 
  do n't you realise that these are lgbt ukrainians ? 
  yes !, 
  even my local alepa has some . 
  never seen it in lidl though . 
  not all the varieties . 
  the one with nuts and raisins is pretty good . 
  and they used to have one that was dark but with cream in 5x40g bars that was awesome . 
  i wish there was less of the local stuff . 
  i miss some of the nice things they had when they first came to finland and it was centrally sourced :-( if i want to buy fazer candy or maksalaatikko i can go somewhere else . 
  no need to be a snob . 
  lidl actually has some decent cheese , not the gourmet stuff ( at least not cheaply ) , but quite nice everyday cheeses . 
  which would be truly weird , since it is about the worst ( small , messy , too many people , bad selection , horrible queues ) one in town . 
  unfortunately all the good ones are out where the tram does n't go :-(, 
  interesting . 
  what are some latvian dishes you miss ? 
  and have you tasted m\u00e4mmi yet ? 
  i noticed it is starting to appear in stores again . 
  iirc you like breadpuddings in latvia , so you might actually like m\u00e4mmi . 
  ( eat it with cream and milk , and sugar . 
  the sugar is important for texture/mouthfeel . ), 
  know next to nothing about slovenia . 
  richest ex-yugoslav country , borders italy and hungary . 
  first ex-yugoslav member of the eu ? 
  happen to know a bit about slovakia , due to spending holidays there on road trips . 
  slovakia is like central europe 's finns , or maybe norwegians . 
  a bit terse , `` engineer-minded '' , and crazy about nature and hiking . 
  but your cities are much prettier than ours , and you have wine !, 
  and some hungarians left , which is always a culinary plus :-) ) . 
  generally in finland i would guess that people would know more about slovakia than slovenia , due to sports . 
  but maybe slovenes are good at hockey and ski-jumping too ? 
  ( not a big sports fan ), 
   people usualy asked how we coped with that terrible war . 
  and i say , it is okey now , as it was before , because our czech bros helped us a lot back then whaaaa ?!, 
  what war ? 
  oh , i see - do people get very confused by this answer ? 
  or do they just accept it and forever walk around with the idea that brave czechs were involved in the dissolution of yugoslavia ? 
  and had n't the slovaks been agitating for not being ruled from budapest since < ca n't remember exactly  ? 
  i think i 've read something about politicking in the 19th century to get slovakia ruled from vienna instead of budapest . 
  here in swedish speaking finland we also joke about norwegians ( and about swedes ) , but when it comes to the danes it is really only two types of jokes : - ca n't understand what they say / hot potatoes / throat disease - jokes that revolve around danish-swedish misunderstandings and/or swedish tourists being idiots ( k\u00f6penhamns roligaste st\u00e4lle / h\u00e5ll byn ren , f\u00f6lj en svensk till f\u00e4rjan ! ), 
   `` in umbra marelui urss '' quick language question : the acronym would stand for uni-something repub-something ( soviet / ??? ), 
  socialist-something ? 
  possibly with the last two switched around . 
  just curious about things like this - and when/where soviet ( council ) was translated and when not . 
  and i 'm stupidly proud of remembering that `` mare '' is big , not anything to do with the sea , in romania . 
  that is a feature of your language that is a real head-scratcher for us tourists as it is n't an uncommon word in signs and names :-) ( is - lui a case ending because of the preposition ? ), 
  this finn agrees . 
  just subtract all the chain restaurants and minsk looks exactly like a soviet capital should have looked ca 1975 , but never managed to outside of propaganda . 
  ( i am not joking , this was seriously my primary thought after two days in the city a few years ago when i first visited . ), 
  but in this particular case it is worth noting that all but one of the victims were citizens of muslim nations . 
  the bombing in sultanahmet got much more publicity . 
  this might have something to do with the kurdish issue . 
  i think most europeans feel very uneasy about the turkish-kurdish question . 
  if you start to learn even a little bit about it you quickly get horrified , muddled and just plain disgusted with all sides of it . 
  so it is more convenient to just down-play it . 
  in general turkey is a horribly difficult case of cognitive dissonance for modern europeans . 
  on one hand we applaud the modern , secular turkey . 
  on the other hand we absolutely abhor the genocidal nationalistic traits that are so closely linked to it . 
  edit to add : we can sort of gloss over some of the horrible historic things that shaped modern turkey ; we like to pretend that was all in the past , and turkey will of course now become more friendly towards minorities and switch to a more inclusive nationalism , embrace its multi-cultural history and generally become all niceness towards every group that ever lived within its borders . 
  yeah . 
  turkey is a hard thing to love unconditionally . 
  the [ list of victims ] ( https://twitter.com/hayriituncc/status/748073972735090688/photo/1?ref_src=twsrc%5etfw ) did n't actually include one single eu-citizen . 
  ever heard of sri lanka ? 
  or the origin of suicide bombers ? 
   take the security checks in airports and move them to the entrances . 
  which is exactly what atat\u00fcrk airport has had for many years now ... ( ok , so a bit different - they actually have double checks , a quick one ( gate + scanner ) at the entrance to the departure floor and then the thorough one after check-in . ), 
  look at a map of where the explosions/shootings occurred . 
  one close to the entrance security check , one at the arrivals floor , one in a parking structure . 
  as i said , none of this is of any use if the real problem is that you want to keep out eu-citizens with a job who pay their taxes ... 
  but that 's not how it has usually been framed , is it ? 
   yeah i do n't care about non-eu migration in this discussion . 
  not talking about non-eu people . 
  talking about eu citizens : citizen of eu-land a travels to eu-land b. 
  does n't manage to get a job . 
  money runs out .

   but that is in no way a guarantee that it will not happen again . 
  it is n't . 
  that 's why the parliament has been raising a stink about it regarding the mff 2014-20 too . 
  [ long-term eu budget negotiations : ep sets out its stance ] ( http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/pressroom/content/20130312ipr06440/html/long-term-eu-budget-negotiations-ep-sets-out-its-stance ) * the resolution highlights the growing problem of payment shortfalls , which prevent bills being paid and jeopardize eu programmes . 
  last year 's shortfalls meant that several important eu programmes , such as erasmus , the research framework programme and the social fund ran out of funds early in the year . 
  * * parliament insists that the issue of unpaid bills from 2012 must be settled before concluding the multiannual financial framework ( mff ) negotiations , as agreed in last year 's budget talks . 
  parliament also wants a political undertaking from the council that all bills falling due in 2013 will be paid in 2013 , so as to avoid `` rolling over '' a deficit into the new mff . 
  the eu can not legally run a deficit . 
  *  countries have paid , countries have met their commitments . 
  well , there 's problem . 
  countries have made commitments but not paid for all those commitments . 
  now it 's 2013 , the last year of mff 2007-13 and budgetary commitments should be met with actual payments . 
  but with the council it seems to be like pulling teeth ( see their decisions jul and dec 2012 ) . 
   a lot of big deposits at smaller banks ( with probably around 99.9 % russian money ) do n't take any haircut ... and there 's no reason why they should as the banks have not failed . 
   you do n't want to be complicit in lies and theft . 
  there 's no theft happening - when a business fails there will be inevitable losses . 
  but in this case at least the small insured deposists are guaranteed in a failed bank . 
  it 's the uninsured deposits that will take a haircut and share & bondholders will also take losses . 
  the bail-in in cyprus is to guarantee at least the small insured deposits . 
  it 's the big uninsured deposits that take the haircut ( plus shares and bonds ) . 
  and if the `` wealthy investors '' have already taken their money out it 's not german people 's fault . 
   i would like to know the reason for why the eu can not pay its bills ? 
  because there 's not enough money to cover all the budgeted and completed programs from 2012 . 
  those commitments can not be paid without funding in form of payments . 
  that was the original reason they were rolled over to 2013 budget . 
  but the austerity guys in the council thought that it would be beneficial to make also 2013 budget payments too small to cover that . 
   who is responsible for this ? 
  [ ** council ** adopts its position on the 2013 eu budget ] ( http://consilium.europa.eu/homepage/highlights/council-adopts-its-position-on-the-2013-eu-budget?lang=en ) * on 24 july the council adopted its position on the draft eu budget for 2013 . 
  the ministers agreed that the increase in payments should not be higher than 2.79 % compared to the 2012 budget . 
  * * in absolute figures , the council position amounts to 132.70 billion euro in payments ( i.e. 
  actual amounts that could be paid out in 2013 ) and 149.78 billion euro in commitments ( i.e. 
  promises to spend money , which do not necessarily have to be paid out in 2013 , but can be spread over several financial years ) . 
  * * it constitutes an increase of 3.61 billion euro in payments and 1.88 billion euro in commitments compared to the 2012 budget , but a decrease of 5.23 billion euro and 1.15 billion euro respectively if compared to the commission 's proposal for the 2013 budget . 
  * then it was already known that the payments would not be enough . 
  and already in oct 2012 the commission proposed amendments : [ amending eu budget for europe 's students , scientists , ngos ' , businesses and regions ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/budget/news/article_en.cfm?id=201210231543 ) * the commission has adopted today an amending budget to enable it to meet its legal obligations towards beneficiaries of eu funds . 
  this is in line with the joint statement the council and the european parliament adopted the day the eu budget for 2012 was adopted inviting the commission to request additional money `` in an amending budget if the appropriations entered in the 2012 budget are insufficient to cover expenditure '' . 
  * and in oct 2012 the parliament 's position was : [ eu budget 2013 : avoid payments shortfalls and invest in growth and jobs ] ( http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/pressroom/content/20121019ipr54020/html/eu-budget-2013-avoid-payments-shortfalls-and-invest-in-growth-and-jobs ) * to enable the eu to pay its bills in 2013 , council cuts in the european commission 's budget proposal must be reversed , said parliament in a vote on tuesday . 
  reinstating funding for payments in 2013 would help to protect popular eu programmes , such as erasmus mundus and the social fund , against funding shortfalls like those that disrupted them this year . 
  * the 2013 budget was adopted dec 2012 and it was quite clear that the budgeted payments would not be enough and amendments would be needed : [ eu budget 2013 adopted : statement by commissioner for financial programming and budget janusz lewandowski ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/budget/news/article_en.cfm?id=201212130801 ) * `` however i am concerned that the approved budget will in all likelihood not be sufficient to pay the incoming bills . 
  the adopted budget is $ 5 billion below what the commission estimates necessary for 2013 , and another $ 3 billion remain outstanding from amending budget 6 in 2012 . 
  this means that the pressure on the 2013 eu budget will be tremendous . 
  there is a serious risk that we will run out of funds early in the course of next year . 
  i am concerned that by systematically cutting the commission 's estimates , the council transforms the eu annual budget in a budget for 9 to 10 months ; last year we ran out of cash to pay all the claims in november , this year was in october and next year i expect this to happen even earlier . 
  * * i can only hope that , building on the amending budget agreed this year , both the council and the parliament will honour the spirit of the joint statements in which they ask the commission to initiate any necessary action according to the treaty and , in particular , to request additional payment appropriations in an amending budget if the appropriations entered in the 2013 budget prove insufficient to cover expenditure '' . 
  * and now we are here : [ eu budget 2013 : more funding needed to cover unpaid claims from 2012 ] ( http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_ip-13-291_en.htm?locale=en ) more info on developments here : http://ec.europa.eu/budget/news/article_en.cfm?id=201303191223  what is being done to correct it ? 
  the budget is being amended to cover both unpaid expences from 2012 and expenses in 2013 ( e.g. 
  croatia joining needs about 1.1 bn more ) . 
   i actually find it rather extraordinary that the eu apparently are so bad a budgeting , that they need extra money all of a sudden . 
  not `` all of sudden '' . 
   what more - i am afraid that if they get extra money now , it will become a `` habit '' and the eu will not longer care to balance its budget ( which they are supposed to do , but apparently do n't do ) . 
  the amendmends * are * about balancing the budget : payments should meet the commitments . 
  postponing the payments indefinitely does not work . 
  ( whoa , should n't have swinged that claymore of compensation - april 1st ... ), 
   the rule in question is that a euro country must n't have a yearly budget deficit higher than 3 % of its gdp . 
  if that 's the criteria then actually the first to break that rule was portugal . 
  in 1999 portugal had a budget deficit of -3.1 % and in 2000 -3.3 % . 
  then in 2001 four countries broke the rule : germany ( -3.1 % ) , italy ( -3.1 % ) , greece ( -4.5 % ) and portugal ( -4.8 % ) . 
  see this [ eurostat data ] ( http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/portal/page/portal/government_finance_statistics/data/main_tables ) for the first countries to break it : [ imgur ] ( http://i.imgur.com/i0tmvup ), 
   of course , but let us not forget that a `` northern '' nation broke the rules first - germany . 
  what was it that germany was first to do ? 
  indeed . 
  we pay . 
  as we live on this planet , and the dysfunctional stuff is our invention , then we are the ones to pay for it . 
  with imaginary stuff . 
  obviously . 
  that time he was keenly objective , just as is common with brits . 
  the world never actually worked before . 
  not that it works these days , but did n't work before either . 
  no normalcy there to return to but dysfunctionality as usual . 
  yeah , but then again pretty much anyone who said we 're really up shit creek would have made an accurate assessment . 
   what they 're saying is some heavy shit indeed . 
  and make no mistake about it , they 're all saying it . 
  and mean it too . 
  unless some special circumstances apply . 
  but they mean it . 
  seriously mean . 
  really . 
  this time , and for now on . 
  perhaps . 
  in stead of bail-outs it 's gon na be bail-ins . 
  i guess it 's because : 1 . 
  no funds to do otherwise . 
  political support lacking even if funds were available . 
  the voting public ( at least in those countries still with some credit left ) is fed up with bail-outs . 
  us northeners had no sympathy for cypriots , despite how small a sum it actually was . 
  it 's the morally ` right thing to do ' - ants vs. grasshoppers and all that imagination stuff . 
  never saw the eurogroup , the commission and the parliament climb on the same high horse like that . 
  so maybe this time they mean it , or it 's just a special occasion . 
   if an obnoxious catchphrase is n't clever the first time , it is n't clever the second or third time either . 
  clever . 
  i feel so bad for you guys . 
  about what happened . 
  and about what we did .

  if they start gutting education like sipil\u00e4 wants , though , then i may change my tune . 
  i 've removed this because it 's already been posted a few times over the past few days . 
  you 're welcome to go to any of those threads to discuss this topic . 
  thanks !, 
  hi there . 
  could you please repost this question to / r/askeurope ? 
  you 'll get better answers there . 
  thanks !, 
  i did that on saturday at my friend 's party . 
  her family has a house on the sea and a new terrace , so we danced all night to ys\u00e4ri but then someone asked for abba and abba delivered . 
  abba is love . 
  hi there . 
  i think this post would be better suited for / r/askeurope . 
  please repost there with a little more clarity in your question . 
  thanks . 
  i 'm just in a loving mood lately . 
  i want to hug it . 
  poor thing looks so lonely . 
  true finns are also anti-lgbt . 
  it amuses me how so many people defending these far-right parties and saying muslims will never integrate into western society seem to have a lot of common beliefs with hard-line muslims in regards to lgbt issues ... 
  i do n't think it was a `` fuck russia '' song . 
  i think it was a `` this is the story of what happened to my family in 1944 '' song . 
  and it beats to the sound of sileeeeence, 
  yup . 
  exactly this . 
  i 've been called an islamic apologist by far-right finns on here and as an atheist it blows my mind . 
  somehow thinking not to judge entire groups of people based on what cults like isis does means i loooooove islam . 
  in the minds of those people , if you do n't hate all 2 billion muslims on earth , you 're far-left , pro mass immigration , and a sjw . 
  this is what gets me down about reddit sometimes . 
  during the hockey world championship last week , the racist finnish forums were flipping out because a few well-known not-native finns were taking pictures in the finnish national jersey and cheering for finland . 
  i 'm not `` pro mass immigration '' . 
  i 'm pro rational thinking and pro looking at things from all sides . 
  i 'm pretty center when it xomes to immigration but because i 'm not racist and because i think all these sob stories about how europe is dying or how millions of brown people are raping our women , i 'm an evil communist . 
  excapt several states had documented electoon issues in the primaries . 
  reading the comments here you 'd think austria just elected bin laden as president . 
  this sub is so ridiculous sometimes . 
  better stop stalking me `` bro '' . 
  posts like this are so embarrassing, 
  jesus did he really say that ? 
  excapt i never pretended to be a finn . 
  my flair in / r/finland literally says i 'm an immigrant . 
  i am regularly in the local paper talking about immigrant life . 
  inconvenient details of your agenda here . 
  `` foreigner posing as a finn '' lol . 
  go away, 
  ugh i know . 
  i did n't used to think he was attractive until he hosted with petra this year . 
  now i just want to ravage him . 
  well , yeah . 
  have you seen m\u00e5ns ? 
  so a girl who works in raisio , which is literally just a bunch turku suburb most people only know of for shopping , knows more about the current safety situation in finland than someone who 's lived here for five years and who is active in nightlife and immigrant communities in southwest finland ? 
  okay , then . 
  well , i live in pori , slightly less than two hours from turku . 
  i 'm regularly in both turku and helsinki because of work and friends . 
  i go out a lot . 
  i 'm really active in the ys\u00e4ri scene so i 'm at nightclubs and stuff . 
  i also worked with refugees for six months so there 's that . 
  i 've never seen refugees or anything harass anyone , only the opposite : drunk finnish guys trying to pick fights with people for looking foreign , assuming some indian guys here on work visas were syrian , etc. 
  of course there 's always that weird group of turkish guys at the one night club here but they 've lived here longer than i have and i 've never seen or heard of any trouble . 
  the only issues that seem to happen here with harassment are generally at student parties , and again , that 's been happening forever and those people are n't refugees . 
  sorry to burst your dystopian bubble but finland is still pretty boring and pretty safe . 
  your friends are either lying for attention or are very paranoid . 
  walked home from the monkey about 2km to where i was staying at 3 am two months ago with my friend . 
  the only people we saw on the street were newspaper delivery people . 
  you 're more likely to get hit on by a creepy drunk finn than anyone else . 
  those girls are full of it . 
  `` foreign looking men '' aka other exchange students at student parties , which has been happening since the dawn of time . 
  so confused why ireland did n't go forward . 
  i 'm going to listen to westlife all day tomorrow . 
  also feel bad for the macedonian lady and her donuts . 
  guy was an ethnic german with a history of drug and psychological issues who was barefoot and named paul . 
  liberally nothing to do with muslims or immigrants or anything . 
  `` come the fuck on '' . 
  guy was an ethnic german with a history of drug and psychological issues who was barefoot and named paul . 
  literally nothing to do with muslims or immigrants or anything, 
  native germans with drug problems running barefoot and stabbing people at 5 am ? 
  portuguese trump supporter sounds like an indie band . 
  the chorus part of this song was made in 2012 for an ad by one of finland 's biggest phone companies . 
  it was such a hit that they finished the song and turned it into a single . 
  the artist , eini , has also done a bunch of finnish covers of songs , including motherfucking xanadu . 
  daycare in finland is affordable if you 're poor . 
  but for two working people it can be expensive , especially with multiple kids . 
  i do n't know how ither people do it . 
  also less and less daycare resources . 
  and also everything is really expensive .

  not all the soldiers go into the front lines to fight . 
  also you rarely see israel being commended for having solved this problem in equality ... almost , men 36 months and women 21 months of service . 
   if you hear a new word , you 'll probably have to look up how to spell it . 
  but how do you look it up if you do n't know how to spell it ? 
   i 'm afraid there 's just no statistics or facts given forward by the pro-choice campaign to dispel my fears of abortion as a contraceptive so what about the rest of europe ( minus ireland and poland ) where abortion has been legal for ages already ? 
  are you thinking europeans are currently using abortion irresponsibly ? 
  or do you think it 's only the irish who would use it irresponsibly if it was available in ireland ? 
  your comment is otherwise sane and and level-headed , but who the fuck opposes abortion ? 
  in europe , in 2016 ? 
  what is wrong with the irish and the polish ? 
   numbers who switched their political religion from barack obama in 2012 to trump in 2016 . 
  anyone who voted for obama last time ca n't be easily dismissed as a racist . 
   we have a lot of words with turkic origins like : kebab ? 
  plz add more jpeg until aland disappears . 
  maybe that\u00e4s how finland is spelled in slovakian ? 
  as far as i know , algae growth depends on available nutrients , not temperature . 
   it is not at all realistic to think that turkey can attack greece and bulgaria with the rest of nato and the eu just standing by . 
  in the balkan wars in the 1990s , it took years and years before europe and nato finally got their shit together and we 're able to decide what to do . 
  unless they 'd be mistaken for refugees and put to refugee centers for a couple of weeks , like happened to [ a chinese tourist in germany ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/08/chinese-tourist-who-lost-wallet-in-germany-ends-up-in-refugee-shelter ) . 
  is it only polish , or should tourists avoid speaking in any foreign language ? 
  are there any estimates on the number of people who entered but did not register at all ? 
  more like bigfen mire . 
   to be fair , she did ask people above her for permission , so the blame should fall on that person . 
  who was that person ? 
   the problem is figuring out what germans should spend more money on . 
  migrants ? 
  found the fascist . 
   are there any better sites with articles about this ? 
  at the moment it 's on the front pages of https://www.svt.se/ and http://www.dn.se/, 
   people would eat frogs https://openclipart.org/image/2400px/svg_to_png/222252/feels.png, 
  after you scanians have annexed \u00c5land , will you annex sweden , too ? 
  religions are not monolithic constructions . 
  there are different interpretations and they change in time . 
   they must be reading the wrong book then or they just have a different interpretation of what the text means , than your stone age sentiment . 
  just like during the cold war , now in 2017 in some european countries we are again afraid of russia . 
  because of your geographical location , you in new zealand are fortunate in that you will never need to know the fear of the possibility of your country being invaded and taken over by russians . 
  you will never need to contemplate how far you 'd be willing to go to avoid something like that happening . 
   cryptofascist eco-fascists vs. cryptofascists . 
   best-organized state in the world totally, 
   the burden ( integrating and paying for refugees ) poland has taken in and integrated about 1 million refugees from a war-torn country . 
  they have definitely done their share and more . 
  it is easy to defend the human rights of a handful of islamist activists when they are plotting to take over a country . 
  it is much more difficult to defend the human rights of 78 million citizens when the activists that you defended actually take over the country . 
  it is easy to say that human rights belong to everyone no matter what , but in this case 78 million people are losing their human rights . 
   there is nothing wrong with it there is nothing wrong in the abstract idea of having a culture that is different from the european culture ( like , usa or japan ) . 
  but there is a lot that is wrong in the present turkish culture in practice . 
   we would have to change the constitution . 
  could n't you just reinterpret your constitution ? 
  that 's how america did it . 
  besides the new york times article already linked , eu commission also has similar figure [ in this publication ] ( https://ec.europa.eu/epsc/publications/strategic-notes/irregular-migration-central-mediterranean_en ) . 
  what about [ something like this ] ( https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/i/41dsmnnhdwl._sy355_.jpg ) ? 
   i still find it absolutely mind boggling that western nations threw their weight behind these terrorists . 
  were there any better alternatives in those regions ? 
  assuming that , to promote peace or at least stability , you have to throw your weight behind * someone * . 
   / r/norge and do you speak nynorska or bokm\u00e5l there ? 
   they 're fleeing from taliban . 
  some might end up joining the taliban people who fled from taliban would end up joining taliban ? 
   at some point why call yourself christian jew or muslim if you ignore your religion altogether at least christians can say that god speaks to them directly , which then takes priority over whatever is written in the bible . 
  which coutry has a larger army ? 
  how would you achieve that situation ? 
   til that dictatorship is better than democracy . 
  in iraq , the alternative to dictatorship was civil war , not democracy . 
   his father also had to put down a bloody uprising in hama would it have been better if the uprising had not been put down ? 
   i was assuming these were annual elections . 
  where the fuck do you live , if your country has annual elections ? 
   if i 'm not mistaken in italy it 's a proportional vote ... and italian political history is a complete mess . 
  only france and uk have first-past-the-post voting systems europe ( as far as i know ) , rest of the european countries has proportional voting , and not all of them are a mess . 
  i say italy being a political mess has more to do with italians than their voting system . 
   i find it so fascinating that a party can receive over 30 + % of the national popular vote just a short month ago and end up with less than 10 of 577 parliamentary seats . 
  you probably live in a country with proportional election system . 
  france , usa and uk have one-candidate electoral districts , which makes them gravitate towards a two-party system . 
  center-left party masquerading as far-left ? 
   that 's where i was born . 
  in the windmill on the left , or on the right ? 
   i do n't like that halla-aho chose huhtasaari and especially hakkarainen into his team . 
  as far as understood , the party general assembly voted on the chairperson and on the vice-chairpersons , so halla-aho did n't choose them , but people ( party members in the general assembly ) voted them in . 
  are the northern irish catholic less religious than the protestant ? 
   very socially conservative  hard line christians . 
   oppose gay marriage  oppose abortion are these things true for also the catholic parties in northern ireland ? 
   at the least there are eu funds there is also high competition for the eu funds , it is not easy for a newcomer from outside to be successful in applying for those , with all the experienced eu scientists also applying all the time . 
  is france going to start giving more funds to climate science ? 
  good point . 
  thank you . 
   so the uk also has a semi-democratic system ? 
  what 's up with the anglosphere doing everything so different ? 
  first-past-the-post is how the first still existing democracy , usa , did it . 
  i guess the british copied it from there . 
  i thought marx wanted the means of production , not the products ? 
   my own uncle genuinely asked `` what has the eu ever done for us '' months after the referendum hey , you people are still asking what have the romans ever done for you . 
  and it 's been a while . 
   are their sides so bad that instead of saying anything positive about them , they can just ridiculously parody the opposite one ? 
  in this election , pretty much yes . 
  freedom , haggis and bagpipes . 
   the original planning also included those . 
  in a 2 \u00d7 denser city , all services will be , on the average , 30 % closer . 
  so with the new density that you do n't like , a 1000m walk to a library , could be only 700m , for example . 
  it 's not just money . 
  in a denser city , there will be more restaurants , shops , services , daycare , schools , libraries , doctors , within a convenient 5 to 10 minutes walking distance . 
  i mean , what would france do if russia actually took over estonia , latvia and lithuania ? 
  germany does n't have the capability or the will , and france does n't have the will , to defend the countries at eu 's eastern border .

  italy and ( especially ) greece got overwhelmed while everyone else was just sitting idly by . 
  then when the people started to pour over to other countries , * that 's * when finally the talk about doing something together got some steam . 
  but even then country one by one started doing measures to stop the flow . 
  and that has been a * very * slow process , italy and greece are still overburdened and so on . 
  when something is bigger than one country that 's exactly when the eu should come in and help . 
  but we failed to do that and now we get to pay the price . 
  hopefully next time the countries in the eu see further than their own borders . 
  `` they 're not my problem '' does n't really work when it affects everyone . 
  i doubt throwing greece and italy under the buss would 've worked either . 
  they would 've just let people come through and everyone would 've just tried to fend for themselves . 
  sometimes unified front is way better than everyone just being selfish and making things worse . 
  does n't really help . 
  you need to process them case by case , if you want to follow the laws , treaties and principles i 've mentioned . 
  some things make it quicker , like an agreement that a certain country or area is not dangerous , which enables us to send the applicants from there back . 
  but that still requires us to process them . 
  there 's honestly no solution that 's quick , cheap and easy that does n't also require us to break those treaties and principles . 
  and breaking them would have its own repercussions . 
  there 's no easy way out for us , not anymore . 
  well i assumed we were working in accordance to existing eu laws , universal declaration of human rights , unhcr 's 1951 refugee convention and so on . 
  if we disregard laws and treaties , not to mention eu 's own principles , we could do it a lot cheaper . 
  you 're all just hungry for our sweet sweet timber !, 
  sure , people have thought about that . 
  but where to ? 
  and what is the timeline we 're talking about ? 
  we do n't have existing laws and agreements for that ( afaik ) , and negotiating such things takes up time . 
  time we do n't really have anymore . 
  the relocation plan is an emergency measure , meant to quickly ease the burden on greece and italy and even that is progressing very slowly . 
  imagine how slowly outside relocation would move . 
  relocation to countries outside of the eu will probably move in tandem with the emergency measure , but ca n't replace it altogether . 
  oh , we 're way past point where we could just tell greece to set up camps and hope them to succeed in that . 
  if we had helped greece before with setting up camps and guarding the border ( in addition to working more heavily with turkey early on and so on ) , we would be in a much better position . 
  but we 're past that , unfortunately . 
  not true . 
  unhcr provides ample material on the subject [ ( detention guideline ) ] ( http://www.unhcr.org/505b10ee9.pdf ) . 
   [ ... ] detention of asylum-seekers should normally be avoided and be a measure of last resort . 
  as seeking asylum is not an unlawful act , any restrictions on liberty imposed on persons exercising this right need to be provided for in law , carefully circumscribed and subject to prompt review . 
  detention can only be applied where it pursues a legitimate purpose and has been determined to be both necessary and proportionate in each individual case . 
  respecting the right to seek asylum entails instituting open and humane reception arrangements for asylum-seekers , including safe , dignified and human rights-compatible treatment . 
  and it goes on and on . 
  but the gist of it is that you * are * allowed to detain asylum seekers , as long as it 's in accordance of with and authorised by law , is n't arbitrary , discriminatory and so on . 
  ( the guideline is quite extensive . ), 
  i do n't think there 's much else to do in accordance to the 1951 refugee convention ( unhcr ) and eu 's own laws . 
  is there an alternative that * would n't * fuel eu skeptics ? 
  if the eu had acted decisively and in unified front when this issue was n't as big and mostly limited to greece and italy , we would probably be in a much better position . 
  but no one wanted to do that then ( least the eu skeptics ) and now something drastic like this has to be done . 
  it was a shitty situation in any case and now that we let it progress this far , we have to make shitty decisions . 
   based on feelings rather logic what are you basing this on ? 
   no country is benefitting from all of these immigrants , so why do they keep pushing them down eu 's throat ? 
  well turkey used them as leverage . 
  and the signatories of the 1951 refugee convention are bound by that . 
  so , the one doing the pushing would be the un and even eu 's own laws have much to say about this . 
  better and more committed frontex cooperation could 've probably lessened the problem we 're now facing . 
  but nah , everyone is unwilling to do anything until it directly and in a major way affects them . 
  greece ( and italy ) we 're both pretty overwhelmed by the whole thing . 
  i * really * doubt it . 
  i do n't think there 's any framework for punishing countries that want to leave and do it `` in accordance with its own constitutional requirements '' ( from the `` secession clause '' , treaty of lisbon ) . 
  the relocation scheme does take into account gdp , population size and such things , so it 's not nearly as bad might seem at first . 
  though if the wish is to have zero , of course it 's worse than that . 
  treaty of lisbon provides a secession clause , so if it 's what you want , you 're free to seek a referendum . 
  probably , even though uk has n't got anything to do with this . 
  uk , ireland and denmark will have to specifically opt-in to be included in the relocation scheme . 
  in the event of one or more member states being confronted by an emergency situation characterised by a sudden inflow of nationals of third countries , *** the council , on a proposal from the commission *** , may adopt provisional measures for the benefit of the member state ( s ) concerned . 
  *** it shall act after consulting the european parliament . 
  *** so , at least it has went through multiple hoops before being forced on anyone . 
  ( and still the legitimacy is being questioned in eu court . ), 
  well greece is absolutely being crushed under the weight of the problem , especially given their `` preexisting condition '' , so relocating the refugees according to the `` distribution key '' seems like the best way to go . 
  i hope something could 've been done sooner and more decisively , but that did n't happen so here we are . 
  and once you look into the how they 're planning to distribute the asylum seekers , it does n't look * that * bad . 
  they 're taking into account many of the factors that are required to process the applicants swiftly and in a proper manner , as to not overburden countries . 
  it 's not the optimal way to handle the migrant crisis , but it 's probably the best way at this point . 
  i agree , though as a side note :  that 's the whole problem in a nutshell . 
  according to the un refugee convention the first country where refugees arrive has to process the asylum requests . 
  i did n't actually find this in the 1951 refugee convention ( at least with quick searching ) . 
  i know it 's present in the [ dublin ii regulation ( html , english ) ] ( http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/txt/html/?uri=uriserv:l33153&amp;from=en ) , with the wording :  illegal entry or stay in a member state  where the asylum seeker has irregularly crossed the border into a member state , that member state will be responsible for examining the asylum application . 
  though it continues :  [ ... ] this responsibility ceases 12 months after the date on which the border has been illegally crossed . 
   when the asylum seeker has been living for a continuous period of at least five months in a member state before lodging his/her asylum application , that member state becomes responsible for examining the application . 
  where the applicant has been living for a period of time of at least five months in several member states , the member state where he/she lived most recently shall be responsible for examining the application . 
  which , in light of recent happenings , can be seen as pretty problematic . 
  no wonder the more `` desirable '' countries are looking to tighten their application process . 
  if you 're wondering what the legal basis for the relocation is : [ european schemes for relocation and resettlement ( pdf ) ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/home-affairs/what-we-do/policies/european-agenda-migration/background-information/docs/communication_on_the_european_agenda_on_migration_annex_en.pdf ) :  on the basis of a distribution key , the commission will , by the end of may , propose triggering the emergency response system envisaged under articl e 78 ( 3 ) of the treaty on the functioning of the european union and introduce a temporary european relocation scheme for asylum seekers who are in clear need of international protection . 
  article 78 ( 3 ) of the treaty on the functioning of the european union ( [ link to tfeu ] ( http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/txt/html/?uri=celex:12012e/txt&amp;from=en ) ) :  78 ( 3 . ), 
  in the event of one or more member states being confronted by an emergency situation characterised by a sudden inflow of nationals of third countries , the council , on a proposal from the commission , may adopt provisional measures for the benefit of the member state ( s ) concerned . 
  it shall act after consulting the european parliament . 
  the legal basis of that has been questioned by two members ( afaik ) , so it will probably be debated , but this has been used for the justification for the plan . 
   right to decide on how a country distributes its welfare ? 
  i 'm sure the eu has some say in the treatment of asylum seekers , but is n't this mostly handled by the eu ? 
  *** edit : *** the 1951 refugee convention , united nations high commissioner for refugees ( unhcr ) , chapter v : public relief and social security , part 1 : public relief and health care , 1 . international standard :  the contracting states shall accord to refugees lawfully staying in their territory the same treatment with respect to public relief and assistance as is accorded to their nationals  1951 convention , article 23 , public relief [ pdf ] ( http://www.unhcr.org/cgi-bin/texis/vtx/home/opendocpdfviewer.html?docid=3cf33fbc4&amp;query=refugee%20benefits ), 
  the current system is kinda giving the finger to the border countries . 
  shared weight would better ensure that no one country does n't have to take all the others pressure and ensures that everyone is committed to doing something about this mess . 
  the current system of `` you take care of it ! '', 
  is fucking terrible and something needs to be done . 
  i somehow feel like that 's more likely to happen with nato than common eu military . 
  nato would have less to lose with that one and could start playing the long game , while eu would be pretty fucked if it just gave up half the continent . 
  a lot of people are worse than ignorant when it comes to how the eu works . 
  well it would hurt them more than us , so maybe the eu just stopped giving a shit ? 
  that would be pretty hilarious , actually . 
  `` we 're leaving and we really mean it ! '', 
  well everything the eu does that i do n't agree with is undemocratic , of course . 
   i do n't recognise any eu legitimacy on the issue well okay ? 
  i mean , i must be reading this wrong .

and swiss had to remove that 1km/h so they can show the world how safe they are . 
  im not saying they should get better salary just common sense that it would work that way here . 
  in the long run if companies and investors are being taxed hardly they will move away with the jobs . 
  unless state has its own companies that can give job to everyone . 
  the green party is whining about cuts made to education while when they were in charge they had much bigger cuts to education . 
  populist much ? 
  but its silly right ? 
  highly educated should get better salary . 
  still the greens want higher taxes to more wealthy and better paid people ? 
  this was election that cant be compared to parlament elections . 
  most likely if jussi halla-aho will be elected , the anti immigrants will vote for finns party and they are in -2 % - +2 % range . 
  its true , because they have many ex communist party members in the party . 
  also they oppose current governments immigration policy which includes expulsion of criminal immigrants ( really bad for greens cause these people will get to danger in their home country ) and stricker standards for which area is safe and which is not . 
  well the green party chariman ville niinist\u00f6 spreaded false information that kids and pregnant women are being sent back to afghanistan which wasnt true . 
  and incited his supporters to attack against the police who are working with the deports . 
  which means `` join us to make sure people arent sent to danger '' he attacked against the courts decision and green party supporters tried to disturb police work . 
  i think it shows in the post if its edited . 
  as i said earlier , what youre saying is only letting them blackmail us . 
  if you do something to us we 'll attack on you . 
  i thought akp was the terrorist organization ? 
  so we cant really do anything ? 
  just hope this wont happen again ? 
  because if we say anything bad about them they just do another attack . 
  are we really letting them blackmail us like that ? 
  and the people whos agenda is to let them enter arent responsible in any way for this ? 
  even though people have warned this will happen . 
  yeah but they arent killed by other group like christians right ? 
  their religion is bad for people . 
  in fact all religions are bad in some way but others like islam really bad . 
  finland 100 years , its time to make this right and bring finlandia hymn for our national anthem . 
  its so beautiful compared to maamme . 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yv0rghhgn4 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ff2jg89n7io, 
  kurds have high fertility ? 
  youre in trouble when they gain population over time . 
  yeah i know but it was so obvious . 
  do i need to give source for like this is a rock so that people believe its a rock ? 
  and well about the source our finnish newspapers considered it reliable so dunno why these people dont . 
  well about the petersburg bombing i said based on the pic of the suspect i linked that its a muslim terrorist which russians have later confirmed . 
  shitload of downvotes . 
  so i figured out these people are mostly lefties and its useless to say anything like this . 
  you dont know how lefties think . 
  if they think its wrong then its wrong even if you give proof . 
  if i say its because muslim immigrants of course it gets downvoted even if its true . 
  http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/immigrant-children-in-sweden-blamed-for-countrys-poor-test-scores-a6934111.html `` a report by the government-run swedish education agency said more resources were needed for schools with large numbers of pupils who are immigrants or who have two immigrant parents . 
  it said immigrant children were 85 per cent accountable for a four-per-cent increase in the number of children failing to get good enough grades in the final years of school , according to afp . '', 
  `` we already know that immigrant students on average have lower performance in school . 
  now we know more about how much the increasing proportion of immigrant students has affected overall performance , '' she said , according to afp . 
  do i need to give the simple reason why sweden is doing so badly ? 
  oh but you cant say it i get so many minus votes if i say it . 
  nobody knows the truth but there are theories it exploded too early and was ment to be exploded after the place was locked and nobody was thre . 
  kinda like vandalism . 
  well , he looks like typical muslim and most of the terrorists are muslims :d, 
  the only bombing in finland hasnt been confirmed if it was intentional . 
  muslims anyway, 
  all killed by islamic terrorists, 
  you mean the red pin ? 
  has any of you been there ? 
  can you confirm there actually are people there ? 
  from what ive learned from erdogan the difference is that germans are nazis and austrians arent . 
  ( yet ), 
  kids are pranking with their lives . 
  ive always been happy for our danish brothers . 
  every dane i know wonder why are we shooting ourselves in the leg by letting them in ... 
  http://www.zmescience.com/medicine/hiv-aids-finnish-immunity-26112013/ idk how trusted the source is . 
  but its in the internet so i has to be true right ? 
   like abraham lincoln said . 
  2,5 % or so are immune to aids in finland . 
  every victim is too much . 
  soviet union ceased to exist in 1991 ? 
  i know its dry but they still have bananas there . 
  he promised that the bananas they stole back then will be returned . 
  no he said `` number of kids for people born outside of sweden to 2.17 '' like all people born outside were muslims . 
  so of course that number is lower because europeans are in it . 
  well , do you know which is the biggest group born outside sweden ? 
  no i promise if you look at it for 30 mins its 2017 . 
  and if you look at it for 9 months its 2018 . 
  magic ? 
  naah , germans never made that far . 
  the years are just going slowly . 
  wait 30 min and you get to 2017 . 
  northern countries look bigger than they are . 
  i mean germany and finland are actually about the same size . 
  can we give some refugees back in exchange ? 
  30s are in fashion again ? 
  what the hell ? 
  the first pic is from germany-turkey non aggression pact signing most likely . 
  its because we just received well trained doctors , engineers and all sorts of experts from somalia and iraq . 
  some say half of them cant read or write but theyre still amazing experts . 
  i 'll give my personal support aswell . 
  not going to turkey or any muslim country ever again . 
  we 'll see how they like it when tourism dies . 
  youre bragging with -6 ? 
  really ? 
  thats like nothing . 
  where is the great atat\u00fcrk when you need him ? 
  im not talking about isis or any certain group . 
  im talking about the endless and endless waves of millions and millions of people coming to europe from africa and middle east . 
  meanwhile we are losing millions and millions of our people . 
  the ratio is going worse every year . 
  there will be a time when we are done .

  one from the president , second one from the whoever is the top boss handling the nuclear weapons command . 
  this a safeguard against the president going nuts . 
  that gives the image that the president can just order nuclear weapons to be used out of the blue . 
  the president alone can not order this . 
  the president is homewer required to authorize such an action and realistically the request to authorize it would come from the nuclear weapons command , not the other way around . 
  i really doubt that the nuclear weapons command would under `` normal '' , below defcon 2 circumstances follow the order from a president to initiate a non-provoked nuclear strike . 
  sure . 
  the army should not take any official stance on political matters ( apart from matters of defence policy and such ) and this should be strictly enforced . 
  but i dont think that ww2 memorabilia displayed at an army base is a sign of right wing extremism . 
  its just pictures of wehrmacht soldiers , helmets and decorations . 
  its healthy appreciation for the military history of the country . 
  now , it would of course be different if they had ss caps and nazi flags hanging around on the walls, 
   according to them macron has been buying meth for bitcoins and also buying hallucinogenic salt baths . 
  i dont like either macron or le pen but if thats true id vote for macron even though i dislike him more than le pen . 
  this is good for bitcoin, 
   not doing this would be allowing the anonymous people behind the leak to successfully interfere with french 's democratic process . 
  man theres alot of shit with anonymous or no sources whatsoever being thrown around during this election yet this is the only case so far where the media was warned to not publish ? 
  and also far-left extremists . 
  far right and far left extremism feed eachother in a cycle of constant conflict and escalation . 
  id bet the main reason you see it like that is due to your own political views . 
  stating that all armies `` tend to be filled with far right morons '' is quite a statement so i expect you to have something objective to back it up with . 
  im open to think about this if you give something to back up your claim . 
  do something constructive instead of making wild claims and downvoting replies you disagree with, 
  100 % agree with the last paragraph . 
  this especially applies to a country like germany where most of the people arent really into serving in the military ( the reason being is that patriotism/nationalism is sort of weird for most germans ) so youre right about scraping the bottom of the barrel for recruits . 
  i guess this is one of the bad things that happens when alienate people from patriotism . 
   germany is n't really that patriotic , except for the army and football matches . 
   the army is known to be a safehaven for ( far ) right wing people . 
  patriotic or nationalistic doesnt equal far right or any sort of extremism . 
  thats like saying all muslims are salafi jihadists . 
  all jihadists might be muslim but that doesnt make it right to generalize . 
  the same applies to patriotism or nationalism . 
  all right wing extremists might be nationalist but that doesnt make it right to say that nationalism equals extremism . 
  its logical that people who serve in the military are patriotic because literally their duty is to defend the sovereignty and the legitimate establishment of their country . 
   they were promoting it . 
  tbh that tweet is very neutral in that regard . 
  i wouldnt say they promoted this conspiracy theory . 
   has the power to order the use of nuclear weapons its a bit more complicated than that . 
  my point was that all these `` lets ban free soda refills '' - things are superficial , just for show . 
  if you want to combat obesity in this way , you should just ban fast food alltogether or ban advertising of fast food . 
  im not saying banning free soda refills is bad , it just doesnt have any effect on obesity from a public health perspective so its stupid . 
  education is still the best way to combat obesity . 
  we need someone like carl sagan for nutrition stuff to make the information interesting and easy to grasp for most people . 
  forget all the cliche oversimplifications like `` eat vegetables and you dont get fat '' - stuff . 
  you need to educate people on the things that this is based on . 
  you need to teach educate people about calories in , calories out . 
  publicly combat/debunk all the fad diets , weight loss pills , magic fat burning 5min exercise routines and whatever quackery and promote ways to make a sustainable change in dietary habits based on easy-to-grasp information on nutrition . 
  make a free version of myfitnesspal or something for people to use and promote it . 
  most people are not stupid as fuck , they will grasp information if you make it interesting and present it in a practical way . 
  e : yeah but go on and downvote me since i dont think that superficial actions will fix the obesity problem . 
   government is fighting obesity as well , for example by banning free soda refills in fast food restaurant thats stupid . 
  people get fat because of their routine eating habits . 
  not because of free soda refills . 
  if someone goes to a fast food restaurant routinely , the problem isnt free soda . 
   also , i have a former-finnish-citizen friend who was , how to say , taken by the swedish government in the early 70s as a child many finns had that happen, 
  we have to protect finnish minorities in sweden against the fascist junta, 
  yes, 
  crap like anti-vaccination mentality is not by any means specific to people supporting populist movements . 
  one tweet that trump sent = / = all ( real and alleged ) populist movements . 
  people across the political spectrum have been affected by all kinds of quackery , disinformation and pseudoscience . 
  unfortunately , once a person starts to believe in something like this , its really hard , even impossible to convince them otherwise . 
  which is why imo anti-vaccination disinformation propaganda and all sorts of quackery should be made illegal . 
  criticism is okay but mass propagation of lies that lead to public health issues is not . 
   modern day nationalists dislike these ngos ( like nato and the un ) and are threatening to bring back the same foreign policy that people had in the early 20th century which was heavily based in the same idea of nationalism and lead to ww1 and 2 . 
  theres good reasons to criticize un and the nato . 
  btw `` pax americana '' refers to the peace in the americas and in west europe . 
  its not the `` state of the world '' . 
   have people not seen the damage brexit and trump have done to their respective countries ? 
  the damage was already there . 
  thats the reason brexit and trump happened . 
  yeah not every european country is ridiculously anti-israeli . 
  the difference beetween sweden and finland in that aspect is actually quite impressive, 
  these guys are self-admitted nazis . 
   especially the riot police that has a history of violence . 
  no shit . 
  you need violence to disperse violent riots . 
  what , do you think the police should fucking bow and submit to these violent extremists ? 
  if you go throw rocks and molotovs at police and beat them with sticks , dont bitch when you get beaten with batons or shot with projectiles . 
  its democracy . 
  the fact you dont agree with how someone votes doesnt make them any less of a human . 
  whatever . 
  this discussion is fruitless, 
  i just commented several times where i explained how collective punishment on a whole ethnic group is not okay and when it involves ethnic cleansing , its regarded as genocide . 
   and they betrayed their country . 
  as such they had to leave . 
   citizenship means something a collective punishment on an ethnic group and thus ethnic cleansing . 
  period . 
  very similiar to srebrenica  they were n't asked to move but were starved and shot ? 
  doesnt matter . 
   since when were the serbian bosnian the official authority ? 
  they proclaimed themselves as the official authority  did finland genocide the soviets when they had to leave the country ? 
   citizens of another country were no longer welcome in poland . 
  as i said alot of them had lived in poland prior to ww2, 
  i guess you could say the bosniaks who were murdered were citizens of yugoslavia and `` committed high treason by being supportive towards separatist militias ''  did the jews collaborate with anyone you know the nazis genocided other people than just jews right ? 
   do you understand the concept of citizenship and duty to one 's country ? 
  yes but i dont think wholesale ethnic cleansing is okay, 
  by that logic you could accuse all the civilians of the areas you just occupied with `` high treason '' because they supported the government of the hostile country and genocide them . 
  by this logic , srebrenica was not a crime nor a genocide . 
  the civilians supported bosniak militias so it was okay to kill them for high treason ? 
  honest question .

  how would europe react if russia started saying how europe would be best split between the industrial north and the lazy south because they clearly have nothing in common, 
  but yet nobody calls them on it . 
  i do all the time but it 's like talking to a wall . 
  now the same bullshit is being spouted regarding ukraine but when point out how austerity and imf vultures will just make it worse i get called a paid russian shill, 
  lets just not mention the one in power right now though shall we  that said unlike merkel her nudes are something i could look at . 
  just wish we had leftist politicians that could speak like that here too . 
  thats cool , it just grinds my gears every time i hear of us spreading more democracy and fucking up nations . 
  how are people fooled time and time again , to quote russell brand , we do need a revolution, 
  pwc will say anything for a price, 
  yea and i would say the same about the usa and their colonial aspirations . 
  less arms/more education , i say, 
  hitler did a lot of preparing for war despite being told not to and he got his war as well, 
   if he was an obedient dog like the gulf arabs he 'd have been just fine . 
  you are showing your colours right there , so essentially everyone must lay down to the west or be killed ... nice good to know things have changed so much since the colonial era, 
  you tell me then but i know gadaffi had plans to stop selling it in usd and the as we know the americans do n't take threats to the petrodollar lighty . 
  also  the starting pistol has been fired on bids by britain and other western powers to secure a slice of the oil prize in libya when france said it was `` fair and logical '' for its companies to benefit . 
   at the moment , the libyan oil industry is in limbo . 
  real progress wo n't come until the next licensing period , during which the government will offer new onshore and offshore zones for exploration and production . 
   the last round of divvying up resources began in 2005 under the exploration and production sharing agreement iv . 
  to win bids for joint ventures under the epsa iv framework , international oil corporations had to offer huge shares of production -- often approaching 90 percent -- to libya 's national oil corporation , or noc , and agree to significant risks and huge signing bonuses . 
  http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/sep/01/libya-oil i expect they will do a bit better than 90 % this time, 
  not exactly , google should have local servers anyway and if you book through a russian site i ca n't see how it would post an issue . 
  europe has already considered the local data idea as well, 
  and that 's why defense integration and corporation is what 's required and not more spending . 
  everything does n't require money and europe combed already has the second biggest military in the world , unless we plan on taking out the us we do n't need more money thrown at it . 
  being tied to the sinking american ship is not something i want for sure however, 
  nato plundered libya pretty well in the form of oil contracts for their nations backers ( corporations ), 
  yea that sure worked well all through history / s, 
  good thing we do n't want to join an aggressive military alliance then, 
  i suppose if you see someone getting beaten on the street you ignore that as well . 
  personally i prefer to engage those i disagree with, 
  inforamtion and while american media does n't twist things in the same war russian media does , it often just omits events and details that does n't fit the narrative . 
  there is a reason we do n't shit about ukraine in the american media these days even though more people are dying there than ever right now, 
  well there was the `` exploding air conditioner '' story for a start, 
  oh come on , even the bbc is just as bad these days too . 
  i 've barely seena single mention fo the shelling and humanatarian issue in ukraine right now but when there was protests it was front page every day, 
   russian propaganda you mean news you do n't agree with . 
  do n't get me started on how ukranian propaganda is just as bad or do you even recognise this ? 
  ugh , feed lot beef is nothing like grass fed ... no thanks, 
  totally agree , you do n't just install democracy , old generations pretty much have to die off before anything really happens . 
  the yeltsin years and his oh so great `` imf advisors '' are the reason russia is so wary of the west now . 
  they tried to plunder the country and hand it over to a few olligarchs the west could rely on to keep power ( ala saudi arabia ) but it failed . 
  russia is a transitioning country , give it time, 
  shit like this is why bitcoin  paypal, 
  referendum on new members mandatory in all states, 
  i thought to limit myself to the economic sphere of sterotypes but maybe i could have thrown in some free market , coorporate welfare as well, 
  go bet your pension on the heavily manipulated stock market and hope it all works out yankee doddle, 
  i sure got enough downvotes to tell me that anyway . 
  ok , anglo then . 
  sound so typical of an american perspective though , `` cut public spending and invest in the stock market '', 
  i guess an ~ ~ american ~ ~ anglo publication had to give them something back after hearing the bj remark ... or maybe it 's just because they are the americans bitch in europe :p, 
  so just the usual `` trololol '' from the uk then, 
  so in other words no privacy rights . 
  or do we now get swat teams and militarized police killing bursting into our homes holding us at gunpoint now too ? 
  take your downvotes and go home , you 're not making any sense, 
  yea it 's a possibility but it 's also a possibility today . 
  in the end it 's a lose-lose scenario since the other company will do the same back to you . 
  for the same reason we try to avoid war because both sides stand to lose more often then not . 
   so you will impose a rationality test on people who want to run mobile phone companies ? 
  i 'd assume the barrier to entry , ( having enough equipment to provide service to a wide enough geographical area to make your network useful ) would mean you realistically would not be dealing with that many individuals and with amount + resources invested to make a network i 'd asume the interests of these people are aligned so i cant see where disagreement will come from . 
  of course if the existing service was good enough that it 's not feasible to add a nother player to the market than no need to worry , if your company is lazy and inefficient than maybe you need to address something . 
   also , as game theory has taught us , there are often strategies which allow one party to sabotage others and still benefit , especially in complicated situations . 
  that 's interesting , i 'm not sure what sort of strategies you are thinking of but i 'm always interested to hear . 
  as it stands i do n't hear of too many people with vendetta 's against phone companies investing in signal blockers or the likes but feel free to inform me of your thoughts, 
   that is the definition of extortion . 
  in the us that 's capitalism baby : =p if you do n't like it go and find someone else who will sell it for less but not blackmail and extortion . 
   i see no reason why the same could not be the case with russia and there is no reason to think the us had some malicious hidden intent in the immediate aftermath of the collapse . 
  you make some good points but let 's face it they did n't do a very good job with russia now did they ? 
  after ww2 the us was a real democracy and not the ironic plutocracy it is today and yea it sure did help get germany and japan back on their feet but iirc the thinking at the time was , this was necessary to stop the dreaded spread of communism . 
  by the time we get to the 70 's 80 's and 90 's the us was more about taking down governments who were unfavorable to them and installing ones who would do as they were told , i 've read confessions of an economic hitman and what they did in south america was criminal so i dont blame those states for hating the us today . 
  america built up a huge debt fighting the cold war and unlike ww2 there was n't going to be the same post war boom due to it 's cold nature , none the less the cost was the same so i see perfect logic when thinking about their actions in other states around the same time how they would want to get a payday from the fall of the ussr . 
  during the 90s i read the russian state was getting 15 cents on the dolllar for it 's oil and gas with a huge amount going to shell and other companies who got to pump and refine it , in any case it was a terrible deal for the state . 
  if america really wanted to help get russia back on their feat why would they see to it they get as little as possible from their own resources ? 
  as far as i can see up until 2012 [ bp owned russian oil ] ( http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2012/10/30/russia-re-nationalizing-its-oil.html ) so the only people who seemed to profit were a few olligarchs and western corporations who did the work . 
  i 've read up a lot on putins rise to power and it seems all he has done ( while also making himself very rich ) is take on and fight the olligarchs even though they initally backed himand take back russian resources from private and foreign control . 
  while this might not suit the west from a purely neutral standpoint he 's not been the world leader given the lot he got when he came to power . 
  sigh ... 
  your first link is in relation to ukraine but you just misread i guess or just happened to not put it in context but in any case nothing was up with the lithuanian supply and nothing was cut for them . 
   the european union and russia traded charges of blackmail on friday over the future of ukraine . 
   the kremlin threatened the country with trade losses worth billions and costing hundreds of thousands of jobs if it signed up to a strategic pact with the european union , senior lithuanian officials said . 
  your second link is firstly relating to oil products and not gas and in fact cites russia saying it was a brief cut for maintance but again you leave that out your third link is well fox news so need i say more ... . . but all i will say is small countries will always have less bargining power than large ones like germany and the price they pay for gas is on par . 
  fox news ( why would i expect less from them ) are of course happy to quote prices from 10 years ago as relevant to today . 
  oh and lituania 's problems can be pointed toward belarus and not just russia but i know they love to blame all their problems on russia http://www.euractiv.com/energy/belarus-stops-gas-transit-west-news-495494, 
   that 's not really true though . 
  russia ( and several other former soviet states ) did a horrible job at privatising assets -- something the west really can not be blamed for -- how can the west not be blamed , it was western advisors and the same economic hitmen who messed up south america along with the imf who steered them through the whole thing . 
   when resource rights were sold , they were not put on open market auctions for the highest bidder ; they were privately sold to well-connected individuals with government links ( especially kgb ones ) . 
  that 's not strictly true although in the end it did go that way , to begin with there was the vouchers system where state assets were divided up in a sort of national lottery iirc , the shares were given out to the population but 1/1000th of some factory worth to a person living through the worst times in russian history who needs to eat . 
  not to mention the fact someone who lived through communism their whole life has no idea what such shares are worth so very soon those who were smart and not so desperate could buy vouchers for pennies on the dollar and build themselves up huge business out of nothing . 
  all of this was done under the eyes of the west who were more than happy to watch power move to a few private hands who could be easilly be influenced . 
  yes the whole thing was botched but they werent exactly getting the best advice imo , i mean why could the state not keep most assets nationalized instead of giving them away for nothing if they were not under pressure to do so ? 
  i 'll admit i do n't know the in 's and out 's and the whole story but regardless of whatever side you like to take when putin came to power and took the power back from the olligarchs it was the best thing someone could have done to help rebuild the russian state . 
  i believe the west wanted to make sure there was no russian state hence the botched way it was let go into private hands . 
  i do n't agree , any rational group of people could decide on a concensus that works for all and would be cheaper too since the huge government bribes you have to pay for access would not be needed . 
  as it stands spectrum is widely underutilized anyway, 
   its not like russia could/would blackmail europe like they do/have done with ukraine and other eastern european countries that dared to turn towards the west . 
  russia cut off gas to ukraine over unpaid bills and the fact they were stealing gas destined for eu clients . 
  yes russia offered them below market prices but removal of that because they turned down the offer to join the eurasian union over the eu is no more blackmail than the eu not paying agriculure subsidys to a country who decides to leave it 's zone . 
  how has russia blackmailed , finland , lituania , poland , estonia , germany ? 
  oh yea they have n't because they did n't break terms and pay as agreed . 
  pretty rich coming from the guy who wo n't source his claim russia spent 50 billion propping up the `` stock market '' the figures are there but i think it 's about time you learned to do some independent study of your own :p bty : i do n't claim they all go home i said they are foreign born so can and often do go home after their studies are completeted .

  that idea is just racist, 
   i for one see no reason to believe that they will behave in the same way that our parents generation behaved ok so you are apparently better than professionals at estimating population growth . 
  anyway experts have another opinion than you . 
  you are implying that these people will have to rely on government assistance . 
  which they will , but in the end it is no doubt economically beneficial . 
  http://simonhedlin.com/2013/01/21/demographic-cliff-ahead/ but let 's not dwell on demographics . 
  you seem to not like our muslim friends at all . 
   wether you like it or not . 
  these people arent europeans . 
  they have grown up under largley undemocratic , unsecular regimes . 
  they have grown up in countries where respectign womens rigths to vote and womens rights to handle their own lives does not exist . 
  they come from regions where ethnicity is not a diffuse concept of nationality , but something that you kill each other for . 
  the syrians actually lived under a secular dictatorship back in the day . 
  much like you did . 
  but your problem is probably with them being muslim . 
  women 's rights is a problem in islam but that problem will become smaller as they integrate into european culture . 
  fun fact , the swiss women got the vote in 1971 , the syrians did in 1953 . 
  fact remains . 
  the syrians are often educated and stem from a civilized society . 
  sooner or later they will integrate . 
   they come from regions where ethnicity is not a diffuse concept of nationality , but something that you kill each other for . 
  a lot of the chaos in the middle east stems from the colonial times . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sykes%e2%80%93picot_agreement genocide is n't a part of their culture or dna . 
  i can promise you they wo n't genocide each other inside europe . 
  also i would n't expect such a smug attitude about genocide from an austrian . 
  that was before there were brown people in our back yards, 
  are they really safe in turkey ? 
  what about iraq ? 
  whether you like it or not the population in europe is getting old and numerically smaller . 
  immigration is a way to combat that . 
   we are at war with the muslim world yeah you 're right . 
  maybe it 's not about color . 
  after all we were at war with the jews 70 years ago, 
  nope probably not . 
  us europeans just enjoy focusing on how things affect us . 
  the real refugee crisis is not in europe . 
  it 's in turkey , lebanon and other neighboring countries, 
  it might very well be erdogan too, 
  this is the answer . 
  also this refugee crisis is nice misdirection from the situation in greece , where the german establishment basically blackmailed them into submission . 
  both groups are human beings . 
  the problem is that many europeans do n't seem to have any empathy for them because they are brown , muslim , foreigners . 
  this is a very small party . 
  they are under threat to fall out of parliament unless they do something populist like this, 
  serious, 
  i 'm afraid that it 's gon na happen everywhere eventually . 
  i do n't like the thought of the government having more tools to control the population . 
  also , even though they say they 'll use it for '' a biobank to reform health care '' it 's likely they will use it for criminal investigations . 
  when the swedish foreign minister was killed like 10 years ago they used a data base like this to get the dna of a suspect . 
  since 1975 there have been blood samples of new borns in sweden to quickly diagnose genetic diseases . 
  these tests have been saved for research purposes . 
  when the police had a suspect but did n't have him in custody they still wanted his dna to make some tests . 
  from the saved blood sample they got the dna and concluded that it was the same as on the murder weapon . 
  a dna base like the one the estonians are preparing is surely going to be abused by the police at some point . 
   such as criminal investigations i think it would be pretty spooky . 
  i do n't like the idea of the government collecting everyone 's dna if they will use it for criminal investigations . 
  it 's my dna and i should be able to choose what i do with it . 
   should tell you what your future holds when the demographic bomb blows and suddenly these people vastly outnumber everyone else . 
  well , there would be much fewer of those muslims if he and bush had n't invaded iraq, 
  meh , the left-wing is in a bit of identity crisis . 
  back in the day the socialists where a realistic threat so bismarck defused their power by giving them some welfare . 
  today when there are more resources the world has taken a sharp rightward turn, 
   cultural phenomenon 1789 , 1848 , 1871 , 1968 the french are good at cultural phenomena . 
  yup . 
  that 's france . 
  birthplace of the popular democracy . 
  not only parliamentary democracy , also corporate . 
  oh fuck , climate change and rising ocean levels is gon na fuck you guys up . 
  it 's a shame , i like your country :(, 
  at least there was no bail out to gree ... oh wait a minute . 
  they have n't kept a single promise have they ? 
  i ca n't believe that the top comments look like this . 
  why would you dismiss the critique of these trade agreements as left-wing populism ? 
  these things are huge threats to our democracy , our health and to our economies . 
  what 's wrong with him, 
  it 's not like sweden would turn into 1984 because racism is illegal . 
  hitler could n't legally come to power in sweden in accordance with this law , i 'm okay with that . 
  larger political problems in sweden is their dreadful treatment of drug users and addicts , and their prostitution law , where the buyer and not the seller is considered a criminal , a system that has lead to more prostitution in sweden . 
  in general the swedes have a smug tendency to assume that what ever they are doing always is the best . 
  you can purchase health insurance and get awesome health care relatively cheap, 
  gongratulations you picked apart my statement and insulted it . 
  i am finnish so naturally i do n't really have my finger on the pulse of american society . 
  none the less my two examples are in my opinion quite interesting . 
  the fact that a news channel would fire someone so they would n't question an upcoming war is pretty unsettling . 
  the fact that 70 % of americans believed hussein had links to 9/11 in 2003 should not be dismissed . 
  you make it seem as if the public believed this simply because they were stupid . 
  fox news anchors kept mentioning saddam and 9/11 in the same sentence , indirectly implying a link . 
  the american public felt that it the iraq war was revenge for 9/11 . 
  the american media failed to properly mention that saddam was n't related to 9/11 . 
  if that is n't evidence for a quite biased news media i do n't know what is . 
  but again you might be more informed than me . 
  was there somewhat critical news reporting at the time ? 
  is there constructive mainstream media today ? 
  well your media was shit http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/washington/2003-09-06-poll-iraq_x.htm i remember that phil donahue was fired from msnbc a few weeks before the war because he would have questioned it . 
  it 's just my general perception that the american mainstream media was , and is , very dysfunctional . 
  if you think otherwise please tell me why . 
  the issue is far more complex than you present it . 
  the american media , especially during the bush years , was incredibly servile to the white house and establishment in general . 
  no one was questioning the iraq war , the patriot act etc. 
  the mainstream media is still today very much a tool of the powerful in america .

finland is not a neutral state . 
   finland because related language and culture i love you too sweetie . 
  that 's why there are all those `` ie , ei , uo , ui , yi , ai ... '' etc in finnish words but not in the same words in estonian . 
  something similar but not quite the same happened to saami in southern finland as well . 
  it was even more radical , a vowel shift , for saami . 
  i do n't know what it 's about southern finland mixing up vowels in words ... :o, 
  silly estonian , you forgot the diphthong . 
  it 's `` tie '' . 
   i 'm an ignorant twat . 
  ftfy . 
  100 0000 m2 100 00 are 100 hectare 1 km2, 
  controversial ? 
  what is this ? 
  the immigration situation in europe and neighbouring regions is in a state of mess . 
  north africa , sahel and the middle east are increasingly unstable regions with a massively growing population in many countries . 
  there 's war in north africa , war in ukraine , war in the middle east , frozen conflicts in transnistria and the caucasus , economic hardship and uncertainty and a growing young population in many of these regions . 
  it has lead to disaster and it 's only going to get worse in the coming decades . 
  regions bordering europe are unstable and the eu has no answers to these problems . 
  i suspect we 'll just wait and see the problems become worse and worse and create a fortress europe in the end . 
  providing family planning and birth control to many of these regions would be a cheap way to prevent problems in the future . 
  the population growth trends in the sahel , for example , are simply unsustainable and will lead to problems . 
  we could help them now instead of paying more for it in the future . 
  do n't worry . 
  many of the loanwords are so old ( from proto-germanic or proto-baltic or even older ) that it 's difficult for native speakers too to know if its a loan word or not without the help of an etymological dictionary . 
  modern ones like `` televisio '' , `` radio '' or `` internet '' are obvious but older ones like `` lattia '' ( compare modern english or swedish `` flat '' ) are not so obvious . 
  i lub you . 
  you 're both cute . 
  se on kivaa * partitive case . 
  yup from gothic . 
  `` em\u00e4 '' would be the finnish word for mother . 
  also notice `` emo '' for animal mothers . 
  in estonian mother is still `` ema '' . 
  i have no idea how it got borrowed . 
  maybe the word got loaned by a group of finnic speakers on the coast and then spread from them . 
  i 'm no linguist but i 've done some reading on my own . 
  i 'm not a 100 % sure . 
  i guess it could be from swedish too . 
  does n't matter because they were borrowed from swedish and german , not from latin or greek . 
  they 're not all swedish-words . 
  many germanic loanwords predate swedish and are actually loans from proto-germanic . 
  the reason for this is that when proto-finnic language arrived at the gulf of finland around 3 000 years ago ( 1 000 bce + ) there were already some proto-germanic speaking people living on the coast of modern day finland . 
  these people then mixed with the finnic speakers giving us much of their vocabulary . 
  there was no swedish back then . 
  swedish loanwords are two millenia older . 
  i made a cute little map of this : http://i.imgur.com/7y3eprq.png saami is wrong but it 's close enough . 
  interesing reading for finnish-speakers about the language history of finland : http://www.elisanet.fi/alkupera/kielet_suomessa_kautta_aikain.pdf, 
  not always though . 
  * sammas could be older , from proto-indo-aryan . 
  idk, 
  found the german . 
  ya , they all say that . 
  correct . 
  oh please . 
   it 's almost germanic in finnish too : `` viini '' a loanword from swedish `` kumi '' a loanword from german `` lakritsi '' from swedish `` ja '' from proto-germanic `` makeinen '' from `` makea '' or `` sweet '' in finnish , originally from proto-germanic `` vaahto '' and `` sekoitus '' i 'm not sure of , could possibly be loans from 2000 + years ago from proto-germanic or baltic . 
  idk, 
   hello / r/europe i am greek hey babe . 
  finnish surnames : korhonen ( rich , proud or possibly deaf , mentally slow ) virtanen ( stream ) m\u00e4kinen ( hill ) nieminen ( cape ) m\u00e4kel\u00e4 ( hill ) h\u00e4m\u00e4l\u00e4inen ( tavastian ) laine ( wave ) heikkinen ( heikki , a finnish first name ) koskinen ( rapid ) j\u00e4rvinen ( lake ) first names are boring . 
  - nen or - inen is just something you put in a surname , like a diminutive i guess . 
  some linguists even group ugric and samoyed as ugric-samoyed branching off from proto-uralic . 
  there probably was no finno-ugric proto-language so it does n't make sense to classify languages as if there was one . 
  also karelians in karelia . 
  uralic big !, 
  finno-ugric is an outdated term . 
  uralic should be used instead . 
  finno-ugric excludes the samoyed languages but according to 21st century research there 's no reason to do so . 
  there was no early split into finno-ugric and samoyed branches from proto-uralic . 
  that does n't say much . 
  things have changed after 2008 . 
  our gdp has n't grown in 7 years . 
  unemployment keeps going up . 
  for the next ten years 2016-2025 predicted growth is 1 % per year . 
  it 's going to be a difficult decade . 
  long term predictions for 2026-2035 are n't much better with 1,2 % yearly growth predicted . 
  i hope they are relocated back to where they came from . 
  i do n't give a fuck about your faith . 
  your faith does n't get to dictate laws . 
  want different laws ? 
  piss off . 
  respect the laws or fuck off . 
   the issue is that you have a group of frustrated , alienated young men who do n't understand the cultural expectations they 're living under . 
  why are they here then ? 
  they do n't belong here . 
  black africans belong in africa , not here . 
  blacks will never be finns , they 'll always be others . 
  they are supposed to go back to africa once the war or whatever is over . 
  i do n't understand why are blacks let to come live in the country ... 
  why are blacks , muslims and russians let into the country ? 
  they add nothing to society but cause problems . 
  * balt ftfy . 
  happy summer solstice !, 
  roma and gays are ok . 
  blacks , muslims and russians can fuck off tho . 
  borders should be closed for such people . 
  after clicking that link it took me five seconds to realise i was n't having another migraine attack but the text was just in greek . 
  ca n't comment on the article but the way i 've seen medical companies promote their products , here in finland , is by arranging short training to doctors and nurses . 
  if you take part in the training/promotion of their products they 'll pay for your dinner . 
  sometimes they have longer 1-2 day trainings with lectures and all , meals and accommodation provided of course . 
  they also visit wards directly and bring bakeries to the staff along with the product they 're promoting and give a short presentation why it 's such a good medication/product to use while the staff is enjoying their coffee break . 
  is this corruption ? 
  maybe , maybe not .

  i also never mentioned eta . 
  he has officially become the worst president of the usa ever . 
  i mean i thought it would be impossible to beat w. bush but man has obama over done him . 
  at least i 'm not part of a country that sells its sole to the highest bidder . 
  showing that you do n't have any real experience of what it was and that your are incapable of understanding basic statistical data . 
  i 'm done arguing with you . 
  have a nice life in the perfect sweden when it blows up in your face . 
  i wo n't be helping you out when it happens . 
  do n't know where these idiots have been but we have tons of wild rives in europe . 
  i 've got my summer house next to one here in finland . 
  in the nordics there are plenty of rivers flowing completely free . 
  it is about the freedom of a region basically . 
  some within the population of this particular region feel , that they do not belong to spain and should be a free sovereign nation . 
  independent and free from outside political influence . 
  for this exact reason some will also support the people incarcerated for actions relating to this cause . 
  for them the acts committed are a part of the struggle for independence . 
  in the same way as the american revolutionaries went against the crown , these people are going against the nation of spain . 
  questioning the claims by spain on the territory they consider theirs . 
  just to point out some things . 
  yes , i do think islam is a dangerous and fanatic religion . 
  and todays sweden does suck , i lived in sweden for more than 20 years , so trust me i know what it 's about , what it was and what i think went wrong . 
  i 'm not talking out of no experience , i lived , worked and was a part of swedish society for the majority of my life . 
  the reason i left was when political correctness became more important than the true value of democracy and freedom . 
  values sweden used to stand for before the leftist invasion of the press , public sector and politics . 
  reading your comments and the stupidity within them suggests that you never experienced what used to be sweden before the 90s . 
  depends on what you define as racism . 
  what i 'm saying is that the swedish democrats are n't a racist party . 
  they are conservative right wing party and having peoples privacy infringed upon because of their political stand is n't ok in my book no matter what you think . 
  here is an example of ridiculousness in sweden regarding people loosing their jobs : http://www.sydsvenskan.se/sverige/sparkad-for-sina-asikter/ i 've been reading your post here before and your generally pro political segregation and talking yourself warm over sweden being a democratic paradise . 
  if you truly value democracy you should never accept anyone for being discriminated for their political opinions nor the party they decide to belong to . 
  the law `` hets mot folkgrupp '' explicitly discriminates against swedes . 
  [ source ] ( http://www.jk.se/beslut/tryck-ochyttrandefrihetsarenden/3217-03-30.aspx ) loosely translates to english : in a case where someone criticises swedes they do not fall under the jurisdiction of the law . 
  so stop giving us the bs that the law in sweden treats everyone the same , it does n't and has never done when it comes to this law . 
  and aftonbladet is very much a national newspaper in the precise same way as the guardian or any other form of media that is available throughout the country . 
  seriously you 're always so full of shit in your comments and arguments . 
  we know you love sweden as it is , but do n't try to lie to us about the facts that can be found by anyone bothering to look into it . 
  it still does n't give you the right to harass people for having political views . 
  that is against the foundation on what is democracy . 
  if you are truly for democracy then you support the right for everyone to have and express their opinion . 
  in swedish you have two words rasist and fr\u00e4mlingfientlig two very different words and the swedish democrats fall under the latter . 
  in sweden , if you share the views of the swedish democrats that is in the parliament then you 're fair game to harassment by media . 
  in some cases people have lost their jobs , been excluded from unions etc. 
  it is behaviour not acceptable in any democracy . 
  sweden a functioning democracy ? 
  well if you call it a functioning democracy when people loose their jobs for supporting a party or having their identities exposed by national newspapers for having opinions then yes sweden is a democracy . 
  but for the rest of the world that is n't a democracy . 
  freedom of speech is limited in sweden by social stigma and your law agains speech regarding to groups of people that does n't give the swedish the same protection under the law as it does to any minority . 
  in a democracy the law treats everyone the same not like it does in sweden . 
  as long as it comes with some dutch cheese . 
  mmmmmm i love dutch cheese !, 
   ... self fulfilling prophecy at its finest as is irish economic planning . 
  sweden needs to get a grip on free speech and democracy in general . 
  and they seriously mean this is n't terms for exclusion from the eu ? 
  i mean as this shitty union was n't enough of a leaking ship already . 
  fuck you malta and you so called shit hole to a country . 
   in reality however you would hope true journalists would be more bold and trusting in the value of free speech than anyone rather than avoiding debate and free discussion . 
  this is it . 
  i think the best thing that the internet has given us is the ability to not be herded the same way we could before . 
  and traditional media is still struggling with this reality . 
  selling is n't the problem the problem is the lack of responsibility of their actions that they have to take . 
  and everyone makes a typo once in a while , so shut the fuck up . 
   what happened to the idea of personal responsibility ? 
  this is the problem . 
  banks do n't have to take personal responsibility . 
  each time they fail , the `` too big to fail '' banks get bailed out by the taxpayer . 
  the same people that would have lost their deposits in the first place . 
  you 've just described the inherent problem of the whole industry . 
  only problem is that you did n't connect the dots . 
  and before you ask me to go research this i 'll point out that i a masters degree in economics . 
  the problem lies in the fact that bankers are continuously bailed out by the state creating a [ principal agent problem ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/principal%e2%80%93agent_problem ) on steroids , where bankers can take unnecessary high risk without having to carry the full economic consequences of their actions . 
  if there were no government bailouts then the willingness to risk would be much lower in these banks . 
  what we have now are banks taking high risks with their clients money while being very sure to have their backs covered by the taxpayer if their investments fail . 
  and if that was n't enough the industry creates bonus systems that reward high risk taking , pushing traders to pursuit insane investments . 
  one step in solving the problem would be a ban on government bailouts of banks and the complete separation of investment banks and `` consumer '' banks . 
  this would force the consumer ( you ) to take an active decision to put your savings in the hands of banks with higher risk and it becomes your own risk to carry as well if the bank fails . 
  the financial sector is so flawed that if it was a casino it would have been regulated down or boarded up in the 80s by government . 
  i know it rocks in general to be from the north  we 're like germanys little brothers and while we might say bad things about germany we still like to snuggle with our big brother every now and then :p jokes aside , thinking of it northern countries have been very tight with germany since [ hanseatic times ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hanseatic_league ) . 
  sure you can . 
  you can make the argument that the germans are already paying for it with their taxes on income etc. 
  so there is n't anything in the eu law that would prohibit this . 
  it does not stop you from moving freely . 
  only limits the roads you can move freely on . 
  majority of eu countries have tolls on their roads except germany , finland , sweden and denmark and maybe a few more . 
  sweden however has congestion fees in stockholm and gothenburg . 
  if i do n't remember wrong when i read about this , the nordic countries would be exempted at least finland and sweden that do n't have tolls on their roads either . 
  so i guess the idea would be that as germans are allowed to drive for free on our roads so can we on their . 
  could be wrong but i have a vague memory of reading this . 
  one thing is sure , the fed does not have any of the gold it says it does . 
  that 's why i was curious to see if you got any of it shipped back home . 
  why do billionaires steel , cheat and lie to make money on the stock exchange . 
  human greed basically . 
  if there is something i wo n't do . 
  it is to argue against a german when it comes to beer . 
  they simply are never wrong regarding beer , so the un should just shut up and do as told !, 
  think if the eu spent just half of what it spends on idiotic bureaucracy on science . 
  of the 49 % of the whole eu budget that the eu spends on agricultural support which produce is dumped on the world market we could take 25 % and invest in science and technology . 
  i find london so non-british . 
  every time i 'm there and that is often because of work it strikes me how few brits i see . 
  and it is expensive as hell :(, 
  on the topic of gold .

  in finland and other european countries the principle is that usually there has to be double punishability , which means that the crime must be punishable in both countries , but then there is also crimes where this not needed and it 's enough if the crime is punishable in the court jurisdiction . 
  typically some crimes , such as war crimes are punishable in european courts even if they were committed abroad and they were legal in the jurisdiction where there were committed . 
  this is also the case in finland were people have been many times convicted for example genocides even when they have been committed abroad and it was legal to do the genocide . 
   and then the right-wing use the media to say `` the immigrants are rioting '' when it 's they who caused it by going in to their neighbourhood making them feel unsafe . 
  i would otherwise think that this comment is sarcasm but i ca n't be sure because you are swedish . 
  :d do you really believe that if the faaar-right goes to a ghetto and protests there , it 's the extreme right 's fault if the refugees start to riot ? 
  that 's like seeing the refugees as animals who ca n't control their behavior and rely on their instincts . 
  they entered a ghetto which inhabitants feel that the ghetto is their property and whites are not welcome to the ghetto . 
  there is videos on the web where the refugees just say outright that this area is `` ours '' . 
   he organized a `` pride-parade '' to march through an immigrant neighbourhood . 
  this was criticized by the swedish national lgbt group rfsl , among others , who said that `` this was a way to increase tensions between groups within society and this was a political trick '' . 
  sad to see that even they use the post-marxist hierarchy where muslims are above hbtq people . 
  it wo n't . 
  even when there was massive riots night after night , the party got 13 % in the elections after those riots . 
  if you look at the [ inglehart -- welzel map ] ( https://hbdchick.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/welzel-inglehart-cultural-map-2015.jpg ) , you notice that the protestant europe and muslim countries are the opposite ends of the culture map . 
  i believe there is a conflict when your parents and the society you grow up in are so different . 
  why should human genetic engineering not be embraced ? 
  it 's a fact that they are smart , and iq tests show it , although the difference is not that big when the average iq of the chinese is something like 106 . 
  however , despite this iq that the tests show they have n't had good societal institutions to support the growth . 
  the biggest problem is that china was for a long time communistic . 
  historically canada has been about 50/50 between protestants and catholics , and ruled by protestants . 
  none of the top 10 countries is a clearly catholic country . 
  the majority in canada and australia speaks a germanic language , what did you mean by the question ? 
  all countries have a culture of bitching . 
  when a thread about this survey was started on a finnish forum , the conclusion was that finland is one of the most corrupt countries in the world and it 's only the supreme court 's task to review the constitutionality of laws , so the study is obviously bullshit . 
  no , many people just search for porn `` in their own language '' . 
  in switzerland the most popular search phrases are german , french or italian porn depending on the region . 
  why are the top 10 countries in all rankings protestant and/or germanic ? 
  is there different r sounds in danish ? 
  the american schools do a good job when the whites are compared to native europeans : http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_-empadqx4hm/trkvzasdwni/aaaaaaaaays/26q8mk1dt3m/s1600/pisa.jpg, 
  it would usually make sense , but in a case where the boy just decides to just stab a passer-by until the passer-by dies the sentence may give the signal that human life is not that much worth . 
  is it the sound of getting strangled , the extremely open and relaxed a-sound or some other sound ? 
  all student dorms should be built in ghettos . 
  at the same time , more dorms can be built for the same money but unlike other social housing the students brings social capital in the ghetto instead of being social housing residents with low social capital . 
  finland has also the most lax sentencing system in the world . 
  countries that have less inmates are either very small such as liechtenstein or seriously underdevoloped such as afghanistan . 
  sometimes the system feels a bit scary , though . 
  a 16 year old boy who stabbed a random man on a street has to sit 4 years in a prison and will then be freed . 
  this is explained quite well in many english faaar-right sites , for example : http://www . 
  *reit*art.com/london/2016/03/01/we-believe-in-islam-mosque-praised-by-police-tells-congregation-to-kill-apostates-and-non-muslims/ replace * with b. 
  that would be at least a good common currency area . 
  meh , it 's enough that there is a wall somewhere between stockholm and uppsala . 
  norrlanders suck in air while making statements , so there is common linguistic base , and uppsala can be saved from the apocalypse . 
  that would be illegal . 
  it 's viewed as a better alternative that women do n't go outside than that they have weapons . 
  they are according to police reports committed by people with either broken swedish or foreign-looking people ( saying arab-looking would be too much even for the police ) . 
  i actually thought that there is perhaps pc people who believe in holding an arm 's length to a refugee . 
  so also my sarcasm detector beeped at the male guardian . 
  i have n't actually realized it before but `` move '' and `` touch '' are same word in swedish . 
  so move ( around ) and touch ( yourself ) are expressed the same way in swedish . 
  must be many funny google translations , like hundreds of women moved around becomes hundreds of women touched themselves . 
  the chances of getting raped are small for a woman if she drives a car from door to door , thus there should be no curfews and woman go then outdoors with their own responsibility . 
  it really is . 
  or the journalists probably do n't see themselves as brainwashers , but instead are just radically pc , but effectively it is brainwashing . 
  this is the case when compared to media in english , finnish , norwegian and danish . 
  the cultural elite is radically pc in general . 
  there is for example theatre plays where women scream that why do i have to bear all these sins that my forefathers have done , and why do i have to have all these white privileges that i ca n't even understand as a white person . 
  how is it misleading if the original title is `` polisen varnar kvinnor i \u00d6stersund f\u00f6r att g\u00e5 ut ensamma '' ? 
  and who would ** not ** have an agenda ? 
  i 'm by nordic standards an immigration critic , extremely liberal , left on social politics and moderately right on market policies and want to see more equality but i 'm not a feminist . 
  so what kind of person over the age of 13 is agenda-free , and does these agendas mean that i ca n't post something on internet forums that for instance show basic income in a positive light , because i have the agenda of being left on social politics ? 
  or is it so that other agendas does n't matter but if you are an immigration critic then you ca n't post anything about immigration on the internet ? 
  can the open and tolerant people post pro-refugee comments or is it so that people with no opinion on the issue can post something about it ? 
  then there would be almost no posts about immigration because at this point almost all europeans have some opinion about it . 
  yes , and if you go out without a male guardian you can keep the men at arm 's length , so getting raped is your own fault . 
   they seem to imply that its a problem with men that isnt native swedish ( caught one person in germany after he tried to leave sweden ) and making reference to a festival in 2014 & 2015 where the police/media decide to ignore where a lot of foreign men were sexually assaulting young girls . 
  yes , the pc swedish media do n't tell anything but at least according to the far-right fria tider the criminals either spoke broken swedish or looked foreign . 
  they do n't care . 
  the areas and schools are segregated so that the swedes live in areas with the other residents being also swedes . 
  then the swedish media brainwashes the swedes with things like swedes dare to report rapes while norwegian and finnish women do n't dare to report rapes . 
  it says that 6 women has been either sexually harassed , raped or assaulted and because of that the police recommends that women should not go outdoors . 
  perhaps in future it will recommend that women may go outdoors if they have a hijab , but now it recommends so . 
  it is true that sweden , denmark and finland are poorer than about 35 to 40 states and uk is poorer than all states when purchasing power is compared . 
  i would say that the differences are so small that socialism would still be better for americans even if it would make them a bit poorer . 
  even if it sounds sexy that the nordic countries are so poor , the numbers is that in the poorest nordic country , finland , the average household has a purchase power of $ 26k while in usa the average household has a purchase power of $ 32k . 
  it 's also worth pointing out that uk is poorer than finland even though it has a class society and low social mobility like u.s. 
  it 's hilarious to think that 4th largest country in the world is nigeria . 
  well , in sweden it 's also the people themselves who wants censorship . 
  in an upper secondary school the pupils demanded trigger warnings if a book contains love between white heterosexual people . 
  it has gone ridiculous in both u.s. and the nordic countries . 
  in usa i ca n't understand how names and pictures of juvenile suspects who have done almost nothing can be published and in the nordic countries it 's typical that the of the murderer or rapist in a famous case is not published in media and you have to look after it in the internet . 
  i 'm afraid what consequences this will have for liberal and left-wing policies . 
  both conservative and right-wing politicians can now start to point what is happening to dat librul sweden as if leftism and liberalism would also mean extreme immigration . 
  norway , denmark and finland are also liberal and radically leftist with normal immigration policies , but most people are stupid and ignorant and could very well start to connect those things in their minds . 
  perhaps this is removed as local news like the 60 minutes camera team that got assaulted in a swedish ghetto ? 
  yes , that 's true , it 's conservative but it 's the only party that clearly opposes immigration . 
  italian , because it has a beautiful melody and only the five vowel sounds a o u e i. 
  2nd icelandic and 3rd the southeastern dialects of norwegian . 
  icelandic just sounds beautiful and it actually looks also beautiful in writing , consider just the icelandic vedur compared to weather , vetter or v\u00e4der . 
  when speaking those norwegian dialects , the voice go up all the time and the speaker sounds like it would be on ecstasy . 
  arabic and somali are clearly the ugliest . 
  no , it was just something that an old granny said in a store while looking at swimsuits . 
   voice-over : countries using usually one or just a couple of voice actors whereas the original soundtrack persists, 
   for example , he is constantly talking about income and wealth inequality , which are not exactly right-wing talking points . 
  yes , but then the top 20 % owns 93 % of the wealth in u.s. 
  if we think about fighting against inequality , in the municipality of helsinki , both vihre\u00e4t and kokoomus have agreed on building 60 % different types of social housing when new residential areas are built . 
  ( kokoomus is the main right-wing party for non-finns reading this . ), 
  so there is clearly worries about inequality among the right-wing . 
  that even the right-wing parties want to have free university education is also an indicator of this . 
  previously you had to open slightly the bikinis to see the butt -- now you have to open slightly the butt to see the bikinis .

  yes , they 're all very beautiful . 
  of course i could n't wear any of them since i 'm not sami . 
  i think the skolt sami dress and enonteki\u00f6-kautokeino dress are the most beautiful ones . 
  skolt dress : http://oddaz.saaminuett.fi/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/mg_4719.jpg enonteki\u00f6-kautokeino dress : http://media.lily.fi/sites/lily/files/styles/wide/public/user/22529/2014/11/saami6.jpg, 
  that 's because finnish is a finno-ugric language and not indo-european like french , russian , greek , english , swedish , latvian or most other languages spoken in europe . 
  yeah , i meant the older minorities . 
  according to wikipedia there are 470 000 finnish speakers , between 40 000 and 70 000 me\u00e4nkieli speakers , 9 500 romani speakers , 9000 sami speakers and an estimated 750-1500 yiddish speakers . 
  i would n't call this `` a couple thousand '' . 
  the finnish ones are very rare too . 
  mostly older people wear them on very rare occasions . 
  you only really see them on folk dance groups . 
  thank you . 
  do they work now ? 
  yes , and they also have people who speak romani , yiddish , finnish , and me\u00e4nkieli . 
  you do realize that there are five minority languages with official status in sweden ? 
  or do you think hat finnish , me\u00e4nkieli , romani , sami and yiddish are swedish dialects or something ? 
  there are a lot of places in finland where swedish is the dominant language , though . 
  that looks delicious . 
  - the rye mcfeast , a hamburger with dark rye bread - cheese nuggets with oltermanni cheese - paulig 's coffee - porridge with dried raspberries - porridge with apple and cinnamon can you get milk in other countries ? 
  that necklace thing is gorgeous . 
  greenland , right ? 
  why ? 
  it 's funny , morris dance was mentioned in a discworld novel and for the longest time i thought terry pratchett has made the whole thing up . 
  i love the provence one , very exquisite . 
  yeah , i was surprised when i first drove on a german autobahn . 
  i mean , i knew that there are 17 million dutch people in the world , but i did n't know they were all in german roads . 
  the only way your gigantic population can fit into your tiny country is by having one third of your population in trailers on german autobahns at any given moment . 
  belarus . 
  why is that country so weird ? 
  they still have death penalty and their `` president '' is scary . 
  it 's awesome if someone tries to learn finnish . 
  perplexing , but definitely admirable . 
  also , username checks out . 
  wow , those hats look like crazy wedding cakes . 
  love the colors !, 
  really ? 
  i think these dresses ( from marken , i think ) are very beautiful : https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/0a/13/81/0a138122221f2bd801c05d37887fe7f6.jpg https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/236x/e0/c6/92/e0c692e4bfad80d856dbcc73aebb9feb.jpg https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/fe/12/00/fe1200192ab2217f28ecb19c60984949.jpg, 
  not dumb , but funny : the catholic church is worried : there are not enough exorcists, 
  apparently in kauniainen , espoo and sipoo . 
  they 're all part of the metropolitan area surrounding helsinki . 
  china ? 
  do you even know where china is ? 
  moon is great . 
  i saw it without knowing what it was about , thinking it would be an exciting sci-fi adventure . 
  it was so sad , one of the saddest movies i 've ever seen . 
  most movies i 've seen are partly , or completely american , but my favorites are : - full metal jacket - fargo - watchmen - doctor strangelove - silence of the lambs, 
  i know that a lot if belgians , frenchmen and germans buy petrol , tobacco products an alcohol product from luxembourg because they 're relatively cheap there . 
  the finnish law says that ( my translation ) : `` anyone who publicly destroys a finnish flag or uses it in an disrespectful manner or removes a publicly displayed finnish flag without permission is to be sentenced to a fine for desecrating the finnish flag . '', 
  this is not the law , but the acceptable way to get rid of a worn out flag is to either cut it into small , unrecognizable pieces and throw into trash , or burn it . 
  so burning a worn out flag is in fact encouraged . 
  in official circumstances people like to speak `` kirjakieli '' ( literally : book language ) . 
  it 's the official finnish in which books and newspapers are written . 
  everyone can speak and write it without thinking , but no one speaks like that in their everyday life . 
  - gingerbreads . 
  the molds come in all shapes too . 
  traditional ones are shaped like men , women , pigs , stars , spruces , reindeer , hearts and flowers : http://www.martat.fi/site/assets/files/4893/piparit_id_14507.jpg - pulla : http://vuodatus-media-1.vuodatus.net/g/11369/1219492.jpg - joulutortut : http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-wxdimwtql8a/vi3babxhs-i/aaaaaaaabwi/ikrvfqbtj9o/s1600/tortut3.jpg ( a few years ago some swedish newspaper commented that they look like swastikas :-d ) also tons of chocolate . 
  the joke 's that she 's dating putin , right ? 
  i think the funniest joke i 've heard about russia is the darkest one . 
  we 'd read in the paper that boris nemtsov had been assassinated right next to the kreml and naturally none of the cctv : s had caught it . 
  everyone thought that it was kinda funny because it was so outrageous , and my mom jokingly said : `` i 'm sure that tomorrow some chechen is going to confess . '', 
  the next day a chechen confessed . 
  can you tell me one joke ? 
  do any russians joke about putin ? 
  come to think of it , it does n't really work so well in english . 
  in finnish the word for `` sharing '' is also the word for `` deviding '' and `` splitting up '' . 
  i know an old finnish ww2 era joke about this : it was quiet in the trenches and the soldiers of both sider were resting between battles . 
  a russian soldier decided to pick up a megaphone and shout some propaganda . 
  he shouted : `` hey , finnish guys , why do n't you surrender and come here , we have mahorka !, 
  ( russian tobacco ) a finnish soldier answered : `` no , you surrender , we have tobacco ! '', 
  `` no , you surrender , we have communism ! '', 
  shouts the russian . 
  there 's a brief silence and then the disappointed finn shouts : `` oh , then you were probably lying about the mahorka too . '', 
  apparently scientology has tried to gain the status of a registered religion , but failed , as it is considered to be more of a corporation than a religious movement . 
  in 2011 there were 120 people in finland who belonged to the finnish scientology association . 
  vladimir putin logged in on facebook and saw a post about ukraine , and thought : `` i got ta share this ! '', 
  i dunno , in primary and secondary school it is , but after that people seem to realize how much easier it is to make fun of the good old superpowers . 
  i think it 's a tie between america and russia . 
  yes . 
  yeah , i agree that sanders was obviously the best choice . 
  but clinton was still miles better than president pussy-grabber , and sometimes you got ta be pragmatic . 
  he supports torture , brags about sexually harassing women , childishly insults his opponents and goes around saying racist shit about everyone . 
  well , i guess he 's the hero america deserves . 
  people not wanting to vote for clinton even though it was obvious that sanders was n't gon na win . 
  the alternative was fucking trump and people still did n't wan na vote for clinton ? 
  no , and no . 
  everyone here has been talking about joining nato for twenty years or so . 
  i think bush junior and his `` wars on terror '' are a big reason why we have n't . 
  and now there 's trump . 
  i 've never heard that . 
  i mean , i know that ` murica is a nickname for the us , but i 've never heard that sentence and do n't understand what it means . 
  is that even grammatically correct ? 
  a weird nerd who likes to sit alone in a cabin in the forest . 
  he does n't really talk except when he 's drunk . 
  how do you define western europe , though ? 
  is finland in western europe ? 
  what about poland ? 
  there are two different definitions for `` nationalist '' in the oxford dictionary : 1 . 
  a person who advocates political independence for a country : 2 . 
  a person with strong patriotic feelings , especially one who believes in the superiority of their country over others . 
  i can only speak for myself , but here 's what i think : 1 ) well if you 've never been in finland and do n't speak finnish , and neither do your parents ... well no 2 ) depends on whether they consider themselves finnish 3 ) yes , if they consider themselves to be finnish .

  because there 's limited amount of stuff one can produce and export . 
  you ca n't sell it everywhere all the time , so you 'll sell it to some markets . 
  they were selling some of their stuff to russia . 
  now they 'll simply sell that part to other markets such as the eu . 
  i do n't get what the big deal is here ? 
  there 's quite big markets for chicken , fruits , and vegetables out there . 
  russians are certainly not the only ones eating food . 
   guess the us was lying last year when they started bombing isis . 
  refineries , oil rigs and the fuel supply were supposed the first targets . 
  they were targeted and bombed already last year . 
  the problem was the damage was repaired . 
  so a better plan was needed . 
  and in october the coalition started their new campaign which has been very effective . 
  the effectiveness of that campaign is the reason we see hundreds of oil trucks concentrated in the desert because of back-logs caused by the new accurate stikes on oil facilities . 
   how is it possible that the russian can destroy so much oil related infrastructure and hundreds of vehicles after more than one year of coalition airstrikes ? 
  it is n't and they have n't . 
  russia has made many nonsensical claims about the effectiveness of their inaccurate dumb bombs such as claiming to have destroyed first 500 and then no less than 1000 oil trucks in one strike . 
  those nice round numbers are obvious bullshit . 
  brave little taylor comes to mind . 
   desecration what you believe they are sacred ? 
   it probably comes from the millions of soldiers that gave their life so the polish and others `` sub-humans '' slavs did n't end up 1/3 exterminated , 1/3 enslaved and 1/3 `` germanificated '' . 
  the soviet union invaded poland with germany in 1939 . 
  they did it together , they even had an agreement about that . 
  on its occupied eastern half of poland the soviet union immediately proceeded to arrest , mass murder and deport people including women and children . 
  during their reign of terror 1939-41 the soviets murdered at least 150,000 people , imprisoned 500,000 and deported more than 1,200,000 . 
  then the soviets unleashed another reign of terror in poland in 1944 . 
  and then some are opionating that poles should be grateful , and respect the ugly monuments celebrating that . 
   there is nothing wrong about bombing all internationally recognized terrorist groups . 
  fuck yeah , let 's start bombing internationally recognized terrorist group hezbollah in syria at long last . 
  no wait . . russia is flying air strikes * for * them , not against them . 
   turkey is doing the same to greece , i just think it is hypocritical . 
  greece and turkey have contested airspace over the aegean . 
  they both repeatedly violate other 's airspace depending on which one you ask . 
   also , russia was fighting isis that area is not in hands of isis . 
  and in syria only a small fraction of russian airstrikes has actually been against isis . 
  they 're there primarily to prop up assad with air support . 
   never had any intention at all to bomb turkey , so i do n't get what the big deal is you can not know the intentions on an unidentified fighter jet coming from a warzone failing to identify while disregarding all instructions given to it . 
  syria has breached turkis airspace before , syria has also shelled turkish territory , and in fact syria has claimed the turkish territory as its own . 
  turkey has good reasons for their roe . 
  had the russian fighter identified itself and followed the instructions it would have gone differently . 
   literally just 1 person in the uk no , it is very well networked in syria - not just a single person . 
  the key word being * realistically * . 
   soon it will be easier for putin to just keep a list of non sanctioned countries . 
  right , and let 's keep in mind that these are technically not legal sanctions . 
  instead of imposing sanctions in accordance of international law and treaties , russia has imposed import bans in breach of the treaties while stating nonsense excuses for doing it . 
  for example they claimed that turkish chicken or tomatos have suddenly in one day become substandard or hazardous to russian consumers . 
  and that 's obvious bullshit . 
  if turkey was to take it to international dispute settlement they could legally seek compensation for damages from russia , and turkey would have a good case . 
  but countries rarely bother . 
   turkey shot down a russian plane and refuses to apologise for the transgression apologise for what exactly ? 
  afaik there 's two very different versions of what transpired , and in the russian version even the path of the aircraft makes no sense . 
  and if the turkish version is correct there 's nothing to apologise for as the mistake is on the russians . 
  so what exactly should turkey apologise ? 
  should they simply approve the russian nonsense version on the events and apologise for that ? 
  or stick to their version ? 
   so if that is not a reason to sanction a nation , then what is ? 
  no , it really is n't a reason . 
  if it was then there would be international sanctions in accordance with international treaties and laws . 
  a reason for sanctions could be for example invading , occupying and annexing neighboring country or parts of it , as has happened in ukraine , or other transgressions of international treaties and law . 
  and if russia considers that international law has been transgressed here then they should call for international investigation for example through the un sc . 
  instead russia has produced a list of excuses by making silly claims : no-one believes turkish chicken or tomatos have become hazardous to russians all of sudden in one day , yet they claim that is the reason for the import bans . 
  so far they have produced a nonsense version of events , imposed nonsense import restrictions , and nonsense travel bans . 
  additionally russia 's actions are in breach of the international trade treaties they have ratified themselves as a wto member . 
  and turkey could seek compensation from russia through the relevant dispute mechanisms in place . 
  but in practise , despite russia having done similar antics time and time again , countries rarely bother to take the issue further and the companies affected seek other markets instead .

   say it plainly deceleration  15.8 to 15.3 uhm ... the last inflation rate number from oct is actually 15.6 % . 
  look at the graph . 
   why would you to to only to the past 6 months instead of its high ? 
  because the question is not what was the highest point but what the inflation rate is doing . 
  if it was currently slowing down then we 'd see a graph where it is falling . 
  yet what we see is not slowing down but remaining about the same . 
   in average that give you a minus -0,1 % per week of decline never heard of such metric before . 
  is this the part where we invent new metrics for fun ? 
   i assume the annual inflation rate is set to dip toward 12 % by the end of the year from its current rate of between 15 % and 16 % , because of a base effect . 
  yes , as the inflation rate was high already in nov and dec 2014 that will be reflected in the coming year-on-year numbers . 
  try looking further into graph , to me it looks like inflation rate has remained more or less the same for the past six months ( 15.3-15 .8 % ) . 
  that 's not slowing down , that 's remaining the same . 
  well , does n't look like much of a slow down happening so far : [ graph ] ( http://i.imgur.com/nunob2i.png ) and were inflation rate to reach the projected 12.7 % by the end of the year it should be falling pretty dramatically . 
  of course , what helps a bit statistically is the fact that nov and dec 2014 had already high inflation rates and that will be reflected in the coming year-on-year numbers . 
  my god , executivemonkey is ken m in disguise . 
  now we have to limit our posts to reposts of executivemonkey . 
  there 's certainly both room and need for more * precision * air strikes , both tactical and strategic , by the coalition ( 1 ) . 
  the us has been conducting by far the majority of the coalition air strikes ( overall ~ 80 % ) , and they will step up when uss harry s. truman arrives to the gulf ( 2 ) . 
  and earlier also the gulf states in the coalition ( saudi-arabia , qatar , bahrain , uae ) conducted air strikes against isis but then the yemen thing happened and they have been concentrating on it since leaving more of the burden on the us . 
  good thing that france brought the cdg in operations , and hopefully the uk commits more strike capabilities in the future . 
  there 's also always need for more * well-trained * ground troops . 
  even if local militia guys want to fight isis they 're not necessarily up to the task . 
  running around with spray & pray tactics is not that effective other than getting you killed . 
  not that isis is better trained or better at fighting but they tend to have good defences built . 
  1 ) and i mean coalition , as the precision of the russian strikes is not very good and only a small fraction of them have been against isis anyway . 
  2 ) there has been no us carrier on the gulf since october after uss theodore roosevelt left because of growing repair back-log . 
  during its operations on the gulf the carrier launched about 1,800 sorties against isis in iraq and syria . 
   the west is hitting strategic targets , and tactical targets . 
  the coalition is doing * both * and has been doing that for a long time . 
   there is little to no ground to air coordination atm . 
  the ground troops have been and are conducting tactical target designation for air strikes . 
  coalition conducts air strikes to support the advance of ground troops . 
  for example , during ground attacks the coalition is hitting daesh fighting positions as designated . 
  examples of air strikes conducted on nov. 26 , note the tactical strikes : \u2022 near fallujah , two strikes struck an isil tactical unit and destroyed an isil rocket rail , an isil fighting position , an isil improvised explosive device ( ied ) cache , and an isil command and control node .

  estonian russians ** are not ** some evil upper class , they are a mostly linguistic group which is actively ** refused ** estonian citizenship even though nearly all of them would like to apply for it . 
  2 sides to each story . 
  wait . . did you say most serbian people online do not * know * about bosnia , or that muslims live there ? 
  how does that work ? 
  oh and please , are you seriously going around making racist jokes and then listing different nationalities from `` goofy '' to `` butthurt '' ? 
  oh and p.s. 
  many would prefer `` pakistani '' or depending on home region , punjabi , rather than `` paki '' . 
  i 'm sorry but that is a load of bs . 
  americans , at least their politician ( s ) , constantly see themselves as victims . 
  then you see newspaper articles about how bad , bad , china and mexico treat poor , poor , u.s. and whatnot , it 's getting ridiculous . 
  and i 'm sorry but that is also a load of bs . 
  visegr\u00e1d 4 , or at least their politicians , constantly see themselves as victims . 
  then you see newspaper articles about how bad , bad eu and turkey treat poor , poor , hungary and poland and whatnot , it 's getting ridiculous . 
  and i 'm sorry but that , again , is a load of bs . 
  russians , or at least their politician ( s ) , constantly see themselves as victims . 
  then you see newspaper articles about how bad , bad , nato treats poor , poor , russia and whatnot , it 's getting ridiculous . 
  ** okay , a low quality post , but i was making a point ** . 
  if you only recognise the whole `` victim '' dialogue being unique to turkey , you need to look literally anywhere else and you 'll see it as well . 
  100 % you 'll find an article about how your own country does the same thing . 
  nobody in this world actively considers themselves oppressors , rather the other way around . 
  makes for quite effective political dialogue , as you can see with how the western world ( that includes turkey and russia ) have been voting for the past decade . 
  to be honest many people know about srebrenica and nothing about armenia . 
  and of course if , as u/charmack90 mentioned , bosnia/croatia/serbia are insignificant countries , armenia and the assyrians are probably even worse off . 
  and i do think the bosnian war is a really important topic to cover in history because it showcases how nationalism and patriotism are based on little to no actual facts or rational thinking . 
  the whole idea `` bosniak '' and `` serb '' ethnicities are troublesome , there were actual examples in the yugoslav wars of serbs `` cleansing '' other serbs , because the differences between serb , croat and bosniak are so miniscule . 
  i mean we have n't really learned much about how to write and teach history . 
  9/11 , in terms of deaths , was 1/3 of the bosnian war , and 1/500 of the armenian genocide , but a depressingly huge amount of people ( europeans , too ) know nothing about the two latter events . 
  and i do n't think any of us here are actively trying to downplay any of these events , but the way we teach and handle history tells ** a lot ** about us , our morals and political ideals today . 
  still do n't think that 's entirely the case , at least outside of germany . 
  it 's actually inside germany where the education system spends a lot of time on ww2 and attempts to not enforce nationalism in any way . 
  the latter one is not actually a bad thing . 
  it 's something that other countries should adopt . . having little kids sing national anthems every few weeks and learn unreliable/coloured accounts of national history is no different from forcing a religion on them before they 're old enough to choose for themselves . . which these kinds of education systems often do as well . 
  `` even '' my country 's accredited eduation system does this . 
  only lately can kids in more urban areas seek an alternative to religious education , and pretty much everybody 's patriotism is being pampered with the type of history education we teach our kids in k12 . 
  that 's the thing . 
  azeri-armenian border dispute -  bad blood . 
  azeris often considered not only turkic , but turkish -  more bad blood . 
  sort of the same case with albanians and serbians i guess . 
  devshirme drama and all that . 
  umm , no ? 
  i think it 's pretty obvious when someone recognises the remembrance day vs. when they , without knowing anything about the conflict and people themselves , use it to advance their already dubious arguments . 
  i mean i used to read the comments of eurovision song contest entries ( just to educate myself as a person i guess ) and you * do not * want to know the type of cancer the comments of armenian , azeri , bosnian , turkish and albanian music videos have . 
  russia gets away with it because the amount of russian eurovision fans are able to overpower the racist comments there . 
  it 's not even reddit where most users are of a similar demographic , depending on sub of course ( gender , age , nationality , etc. 
  ) , and it 's still worse circlejerking . 
  uhh . . what 's your point ? 
  my country can be seen as responsible for oppressing an indigenous ethnic group for a long time ( and is equally reluctant of admitting it ) but i do n't expect swathes of people to all vote for the 1 candidate in 1000 whose sole goal is recognising this issue ( that deals with * others * ) while i know many people do it ( albeit jokingly ) , i do n't go around antagonising my american friends because of trump . 
  there is no perfect democracy ( esp . 
  considering contemporary turkey . . and u.s. ) and as such blaming people for shit governments do should n't be a given . 
  and that 's because democracy is an imperfect system to begin with - i believe politics researchers are known to refer to it as the `` dysfunctional lesser evil '' quite often . 
  not sure i understood you , but my point was that the holocaust happened in western europe whereas the armenian genocide occurred in the middle east . 
  you can see people talk about 1 but not so much about the other . 
  still we call certain media outlets `` global media '' ( e.g. 
  cnn , bbc , al jazeera , etc. ), 
  even though actions show their reporting is anything but global or worldwide . 
  the listening post linked an awesome video on this topic today which is why i 'm bringing it up . 
  same reason why a massive terrorist bombing on a really important mausoleum in sindh province , pakistan a month or two ago was worthy of maybe one news article on bbc ( and the reddit thread was an obnoxious circlejerk about the pakistanis `` deserving it '' ) whereas gang violence in stockholm got people talking about it for weeks . 
  globalisation and `` global media '' misuse the word `` globe '' . 
  i do n't disagree with what you said but imo you 're treading the needle between saying the turkish government is fucked up ( which today at least it pretty much is ) and that the * turks * are somehow responsible/evil/etc . 
  idk why but the whole armenia-azerbaijan-turkey ethnic relations reminds me of the balkans and how the lines tend to obscure between governments and military rule to blaming ordinary people there as well . 
  we 've many examples already of why those lines should never blur . 
  rip . 
  what makes the whole thing sadder is that their deaths have been made into a political tool to advance certain movements ' agendas . 
  it 's quite disrespectful imo . 
  oh and many armenian movements themselves are also guilty of this . 
  calling out the turkish government for not recognising is one thing , preaching hate against azeris and turks on the expense of innocent people is another . 
  benedict anderson is a good author to get familiar with in order to recognise that what 's tragic about genocide is not the nationalities it affected , but the * people * . 
  west-centric media is making it increasingly hard but really people dying in kabul or yerevan should n't be treated differently from people dying in nyc or paris . 
  all right , `` indistinguishable '' is an aggregate term , but the words `` freedom '' and `` democracy '' are just that , words . 
  it 's a tricky discussion but when i speak of culture and national history i 'm not really sure how corruption and democracy fits in . 
  our culture is n't inherently more democratic than that of others , n'est pas ? 
  what makes the karelians of russia so vastly different from those of finland that their ethnic similarities should be ignored ? 
  i think turkey , finland , estonia and hungary all suffer from this idea that `` west '' is good and we need to work and work to become one with the `` west '' , whereas `` east '' is evil incarnate with whom we share no similarities whatsoever . 
  i would n't call you wrong . 
  i mean from outside inspection finland has much more in common with the baltics and poland than with iceland or denmark . 
  and similarly the baltics , poland and finland are infinitely more like russia than say , germany . 
  no matter how much it might trigger this sub , russia and russians are very very similar to many european countries and peoples in general . 
  i mean going outside europe most people are surprised russia is n't in the eu . 
  eye-opening to consider outside opinions and not just drown in insider bordering policies . 
  well yeah , but i meant more of in the swedish empire , kalmar , viking and norse-germanic sense of history and ancestry . 
  like all countries that are smaller than their neighbours ( mongolia , cyprus , korea , afghanistan . . ) , our history is very concerned with sweden and russia but the `` feeling is not mutual '' . 
  not trying to alienate the country or anything but like in estonia there are strong political agendas behind it , ergo making it seem are more western and unlike russia than we actually are . 
  ukraine and south korea are good examples where their relationship to their `` big scary neighbour '' makes them want to appear completely different . . 
  whereas if we 're quite honest they are indistinguishable from one another . . 
  even on a political level most times . 
  i mean finns have a hard time being nordic already . 
  not being a part of scandinavia , having a completely different ancestry and national history , speaking a non-related language and being behind the others in gdp , hdi , gender equality etc. 
  is a tough set of circumstances . 
  gini is the only one finland and estonia do well in but nobody really cares about it . 
  estonia would have to deal with the same challenges dialed up to eleven ( thousand ) . 
  but maybe we can all agree that being considered nordic does n't really matter too much . 
  i mean few people know of any of these countries and being scandinavian/nordic/etc hardly gives you any respect outside certain , really specific areas ( welfare policies and education mostly ) . 
  vaasa , tampere , turku and \u00c5land especially all have high values in that regard . 
  my generalisation is basically just in terms of population/pop . 
  density and other things . 
  the drop from uusimaa to < insert huge amount of municipalities the names of which i can barely pronounce  is quite huge compared to some other countries of similar size . 
  sure . 
  though we should keep in mind the whole `` eastern europe vs western europe '' thing is quite new . 
  i mean we 'll most likely see huge changes in our lifetimes . 
  full reversal is unlikely but france , iberia , the british isles and the nordics will definitely change .

  no one has mentioned latvian or lithuanian yet ? 
  those are weird , but small . 
  hungarian and basque , too . 
  albanian and finnish and estonian probably also . 
  for art-nouveau you must go to prague ( also really nice 1930 : ies functionalist villas in prague 6 ) , if you have n't already . 
  and oradea / nagyv\u00e1rad / gro\u00dfwardein almost on the border between romania and hungary - smaller city , but absolutely fantastic . 
  oh , of course riga ... ca n't help you on goth churches , sorry , not my thing ;-), 
  yes , this . 
  i 've been to vienna , bratislava and budapest , and one thing i 've always wanted to do was take a boat from vienna to bratislava , or even better all the way to budapest . 
  there 's just something about traveling from one great ( but not too big ! ), 
  city to another by river . 
  i think if i wanted to splurge i 'd pick a nice hotel in bratislava , and then do vienna and budapest by boat . 
  i wonder if there is still hydrofoils between the cities ? 
  one day for vienna and maybe stay overnight in budapest for the food . 
  vienna and bratislava are close enough that it does n't matter much which one you fly into . 
  august is a very crowded month , and can be hot , but not hot like in italy or greece . 
  me too !, 
  i 'd also add jordan to the list . 
  only place i 've been to is samarkand , and that was as a young teenager in 1986 ( i think ) . 
  quite stunning that central square with the madrassas . 
  but buchara was somehow more interesting , more organic and you felt the history there much more than in samarkand . 
  at that time ( early gorbachev years ) what was most interesting was actually the difference between uzbekistan and leningrad - how much better the food was ( our russian intourist guide was absolutely in heaven , ate everything in sight ) , how vibrant the local marketplace was . 
  also the weird thing in museums where on one hand imperial russia was bad , but on the other hand also good . 
  that 's a really interesting list - i wonder if it is accurate ? 
  that list puts finland below sweden , but here * every * shop has both normal milk and uht milk . 
  the uht is almost always low-lactose . 
  since i never drink milk as milk , and am moderately lactose intolerant , i really like that it is available everywhere . 
  the taste is no issue when you put it in coffee or use it for cooking . 
  it is a tiny bit more expensive than regular milk ( for store brand , the branded varieties gets noticeably more expensive ) , but it is worth it for the convenience of never having to remember how much milk you have at home in the fridge , i just see to it that i always have one extra unopened . 
  and it really lasts and lasts and lasts , way beyond the best before date . 
  surely someone does ? 
  or you would n't have all the other packaging alternatives ? 
  i think one reason why it never caught on here ( & presumably also sweden and other places where it once existed but no does n't ) was that it was the first / one of the first forms of selling pre-packaged milk . 
  when going from taking your milk bottle/can along to the shop , giving it to the shop assistant to fill it up , and then walking home with it again and placing it in your fridge or cool larder ( or paying much more for milk in actual glass bottles ) , to just picking a package yourself from a shelf it is a big transition . 
  so any small faults/inconveniences in the packaging will make people extra grumpy . 
  plastic bags for liquids is also quite unappealing esthetically , no matter what you print on it . 
  even though i have very little experience with milk or cream sold in bags , i imagine it is n't that easy to puncture them by accident and create a huge mess . 
  but that is only because of reasoning : if they were as fragile as they look , they would n't be on the market anywhere for any length of time . 
  and related to that : i wonder if the material used in the 50/60/70ies was less user friendly than what they use now ? 
  material science and plastics has advanced quite a lot , so it is very possible that the milk bags old people complained about and make fun of were quite different from the ones used today . 
   nowadays - cartons in a shape like this milk from my small hometown that shape is called a tetra-brik . 
  in finland it is mainly used for uht milk mostly ( and for juices and custards and milk alternatives ) . 
  regular milk is mostly sold in gable top cartons . 
  ( there does n't nowadays seem to be anything intrinsic about the packaging shape and shelf-life , there are actually gable-top uht milk also available . 
  it is probably for historic reasons that the brik-shape is more common for things that do n't need refrigeration . ), 
  i have heard stories that we used to have milk in bags before i was born/around the time i was born ( 1972 ) , and everyone always says it was very un-practical and no one liked it . 
  i have no memories of ever seeing milk in finland in bags , only that typical carton ( what is it called ? 
  edit : it is galled a ** gable top ** ) , and tetra-briks . 
  i think i 've also read something about this packaging in sweden , with a tone of `` lol wut tf ?! '', 
  and pictures of the pitchers one was supposed to use with it , so i guess it has also been used there at some point . 
  i 've tried it twice . 
  first time it was n't that bad , second time i actually could n't eat much of it at all and got slightly nauseous . 
  i think the difference was that the first time there was a choice of fillets and whole fish , and a veteran very kindly steered me towards the fillets and helped by showing me the optimum way of preparing it on my plate so it actually tasted pretty good . 
  second time i just could n't get it right and gave up pretty quickly . 
  my experience was that the actual flesh of the fish * is * quite tasty , but skin , bones , innards ( & of course the brine ) is horrible , far too close in taste to the smell . 
  also , soft flatbread really helps . 
  as do onions and other additives . 
  yeah , but they 've gone seriously mainstream only this last year . 
  the name literally means box or drawer . 
  there 's the traditional christmas casseroles of swede/rutabaga , potato , carrot and liver ( different families have a different assortment of these at christmas ) . 
  especially the liver one is also eaten all around the year . 
  and then there is makaronil\u00e5da / laatikko - minced meat and pasta , cabbage ( with and without minced meat ) and mashed potatoes ( with meat , a bit like a shepherds pie ) . 
  all of them available as ready meals from all supermarkets . 
  another thing that is common enough in finland but not seen much abroad is reindeer meat . 
  especially smoked and salted . 
  again available in every small supermarket . 
  verrry tasty but pricy compared to beef or horse . 
  fresh reindeer meat is also available , but except for frozen shavings not that common . 
  very tasty , but again quite expensive . 
  ( imported deer meat is nowadays very common , and i think this is because it tastes similar to reindeer but is much less expensive . ), 
  blood pancakes - not exclusive to finland , but pretty common . 
  again , you can buy them ready made in even the smallest shops . 
  when i was a child ( 70-80ies ) you could also get a dry blood pancake mix , but i 've been searching for that for decades now without any luck . 
  another not-exclusive-but-more-common-here-than-elsewhere thing is spinach pancakes . 
  perennial favourite in schools , also available ready-made in all shops . 
   it 's important that they are made from black bread . 
  indeed . 
  i remember first encountering estonian garlic bread in the mid 90-ies , before it was mass-produced as a snack and every little bar made their own . 
  heaven !, 
  then you started mass producing it , even exporting it , and i tried buying it a few times , but it was just meh . 
  have n't wanted to taste it since . 
  nowadays i can get estonian-type black bread here in finland , but unfortunately i am too lazy to make garlic bread myself . 
  so i fear that heavenly taste of fried black bread dripping with garlic butter will stay a fond memory of my youth :-), 
  interesting . 
  now the curd bars are invading finland too . 
  they have even reached my local , very very small grocery store . 
  interesting . 
  i first encountered pumpkin oil in one single restaurant in slovakia , and was instantly smitten . 
  have bought it in germany a few times to take home , and have even seen it here in finland here and there the last few years . 
  i agree about it being extremely tasty on salads . 
  it was my gateway to oils on salad in general , before my meeting with pumpkin oil i hated any oil on salad , now i can eat like a normal person without a fuss . 
  kofola is lovely . 
  less sweet , more herbs , more coffein . 
  not as carbonated . 
  it 's a pity it is n't exported . 
  now i want to travel to czech-or-slovakia again . 
   for 18th century war history , helsinki has sveaborg , an island fort that is still inhabited by hundreds of people . 
  there are guided tours daily . 
  sveaborg was used in ww2 as well and there is an old ww2 era submarine people can visit , and the south coast as multiple old cannons . 
  also worth noting that sveaborg was mainly built in the mid 18th century ( starting in around 1750 ) , so if you are at all interested in late pre-modern stuff , this is a very interesting place .

  why ? 
  is one person responsible for an entire race ? 
  i ca n't make heads or tails of your `` argument '' , it makes no logical sense . 
  reddit clearly does , `` as a black person i watched this thinking please do n't ... . '' is a common top comment in any r/videos `` armed robber does bad things '' video, 
  i did n't say mass shootings , just talking about your average run of the mill homicide, 
  it 's a direct quote , not an article, 
  i do n't get the point of your comment.if anything you should point your sarcasm to the israeli media in the article i linked that only serve to amplify the message . 
  i 'm sure most normal jews reading about this will just be facepalming going `` why did he have to be jewish '' same as any time there is a shooting in the us black people will think `` please do n't be black , please do n't be black '' stereotypes exist , get over it, 
  what 's ironic and somewhat disturbing is that * jew bankers * literally did this . 
  [ missing moldova fortune raises fears of anti-semitic attacks ] ( http://www.timesofisrael.com/missing-moldova-fortune-raises-fears-of-anti-semitic-attacks/ ) way to reinforce a negative stereotype in an entire country guys, 
  it 's behind a paywall for me but [ here is a google referred ft link ] ( http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0cb4qqqiwaa&amp;url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.ft.com%2fcms%2fs%2f0%2ffb55b4f2-14fc-11e5-9509-00144feabdc0.html&amp;ei=4iccvzvvgywasah2347qbw&amp;usg=afqjcnhy4haeg7apgkx7uusxpqtwqm_yrg&amp;sig2=kmwz98hkf9tztv43p9-uva&amp;bvm=bv.96041959,d.bgg ) that should work ( assuming it 's the same article ) there is so much stupid going on in europe i find it unbelievable we are following this same path of destruction when the answer is simply launch qe for the people , instead of debasing the money supply and giving the money to the banks we need qe with the money going directly into state infrastructure projects that will employ people in their construction and add value to the economy in the long run . 
   even if putin wanted to help , he ca n't . 
  his finances are not that good and he has enough problems on his plate . 
  why does he need to help , he only needs to cooperate * a greek default is bad for europe and by proxy good for russia as it weakens europe . 
  * it 's in russia 's interest to ensure a post ez greek economy at a very minimum does n't collapse even further as greece doing just fine outside the eurozone shows other members there is indeed a second way * gas pipelines and porting russian gas through there over eu pipeline plans . 
  * greece with zero debt is not the same as greece with 170 % or so to gdp . 
  by simply extending credit at normalish rates with perhaps guarantees in place they can get them through the storm and after that the greek economy will recover much after just like iceland . 
  if putin does n't offer them something then he 's not as smart as i gave him credit for imo . 
   greeks do n't have money at this point , they still have a strategic position . 
  also , europe has been trying do diversify its energy imports , which would make greece a large transit point , that in the hands of russia and europe has failed again , saying goodby to more diverse energy suppliers . 
   nobody told them to turn our country into russia 's bitch . 
  it 's called leverage and despite what you say it 's good to have options as it gets you better deals . 
   but how can they physically be raped by women ? 
  i guess blackmail rape could still technically be rape , i.e. 
  `` you sleep with me or you 're losing your job '' , which in the end could end up just being blackmailing if the male does n't consent , but other than that i ca n't see how female to male rape could happen . 
  you 've never woken up with a boner ? 
  i sleep very deeply and i 've literally woken up inside my gf on occasion , she think 's it 's sexy and usually i do n't complain but sometimes it has felt inconvenient . 
  actually she 's pregnant right now and counting back the weeks i have a running joke going that it could be a rape baby , she does n't like that at all . 
  thankfully that makes this ruing sound just a little less insane . 
  germany and it 's digital stazi gema have got to go however, 
  well it would be nice to have a choice, 
  i think that poll was shown to contain a lot of bias and the reality is n't as simple as that . 
  i 'll admit it 's not fully representative but every little helps . 
  i 'll still like to see it though, 
  there is no such thing as defenses , most the money in the world is in private hands and if a few of them think the 10 year outlook for europe is continuing negative all the defenses in the world will mean nothing . 
  as much as i hate the banking class with a passion they really are naive enough to never see the crisis coming, 
   it is blatant that the formulation of the answers are designed for a specific purpose . 
  the first question includes a negative alternative at the end . 
  moreover , even if we ignore the blatant manipulation , the poll still would be wrong . 
  the person answering in polls is always inherently predisposed to choosing the `` middle solution '' . 
  there should have been equal number of answers concerning the two events of staying in eu-leaving eu . 
  thank you for this , when i see a lack of interviews on the streets it does make me wonder why that might be . 
  if i was a greek person right now i would be setting up a camera on the street continuously recording and stopping 1000 people at random to ask them honest questions . 
  while no poll is unbiased at least the recording serves as proof you did n't intentionally manipulate it and serves as proof . 
  is there any english reported media that you say accurately describes the situation that i can investigate ? 
  what would you say the opinion of greeks are now , they still support syriza ? 
   do you think that the current proposal and the following third bailout will pass in the finnish parliament ? 
  from what i 'm reading you guys are n't very happy with greece . 
  good question , you know it has n't actually been discussed as much as i thought it would be here , i 'd imagine we would approve it if the germans did . 
  even our eurosceptic finance minister sounds quite soft at least in this english article . 
   `` credibility will be compromised and rules will become meaningless if they are n't applied . 
  it will erode credibility and support for the eu . 
  one would hope that greece is able to pull itself together , but the syriza government has n't made the situation any easier , '' he observed . 
   however the foreign minister said that something must be done about the country 's acute crisis . 
  maybe i do n't but i 've sure invested hundreds of hours of spare time in it at this stage . 
  it is difficult to tell who is gaining what from this but i can only assume all `` emergency '' talk makes the prospect of a deal before the end of the month more acceptable to both germans and greeks, 
   if they are not going to let it happen , they sure as hell should stop this right now . 
  nobody will accept a lose/lose deal unless there is enough fear generated first . 
  that 's how politics seems to work . 
  oh yea i agree with your line of thinking , illegal migrants are a great bogeyman to distract us from our own problems too . 
  does n't really matter with regard to the euro , merkel has recently said a weaker euro is still desirable to help exports in southern states . 
  1:1 with dollar is acceptable . 
   except greece wo n't back down . 
  i do n't know why everybody 's convinced themselves syriza is bluffing , when they clearly mean every word they say . 
  greece is not bluffing , germany/ecb/imf are now bluffing hoping discord about all this `` preparing for emergency measures '' will turn public opinion in greece to supporting a syriza negotiation . 
  it also has the side effect of buttering up the germans for a last minute bailout should it come to that . 
   what is there to think ? 
  they think they 're fate is in the hands of others , which is perfectly true , and they 're waiting to see what will happen . 
  i 'd just like to hear some opinions from real people of different age groups , i hate recycled media opinion and like first hand accounts more . 
  anyway i 'll bet you or any other other regular here a pizza delivered to an address of their choice there will be deal . 
  i 'm still convinced the eu wo n't let this happen . 
  this is just the market shakedown and `` look what happens if you do this '' to force public opinion and get greece to back down . 
  at the same time i also think it would be better for greece if they did leave but selling that seem to be difficult at home . 
  on a sidepoint , why have n't i see any interviews with greek people on the streets regarding their opinion on this , all you hear about is eu talks but i never hear greek people being interviewed on what they think . 
   and was not ordered to do so . 
  the * order * is the motivation that deep down the author knows this is exactly the sort of bullshit that can earn him a promotion . 
  proving your loyalty is how you rise to the top is these morally corrupt media institutions . 
  i 'd call them worse but reddit seems touchy about outright namedropping `` western propaganda '' and that right there is how censoring yourself begins . 
  but what would it be called ... the robin ? 
  remember kids , at the last g20 they were in an awful rush to get all countries to implement bail in legislation . 
  i 'm not dumb enough to keep my savings in a bank but be aware it 's not safe either if shit does go south, 
  eh i am very much left of the political spectrum but also very much anti illegal immigration . 
  it 's not black and white but put simply i believe of taking care of our own people and fixing our own problem so then we are in a position to think about others . 
   there 's nothing crazy about corporations hiring a few trolls on reddit to try and manipulate people 's opinions against their own interests , when there are billions of dollars of additional profits to be made by ripping off the 99 % . 
  do n't worry they are not stupid enough to let an opportunity like that go to waste www.reddit.com/r/iama/comments/pku22/iama_former_koch_industries_pr_sock_puppet_ama/, 
   `` expiration date '' `` best before '' is not an `` expiration date '' as someone who lived off the reduced isle in the supermarket and even dumster diving in college i wanted to slap that ungrateful bastard so hard right then . 
  after 2007 and well there is no way to go from france to ireland without entering international water as well . 
  i believe if you arouse suspicion emigration authorities are within their right to ask you to present id and they usually know who to pick out based on appearance , ), 
  nope , seen it happen from finland to estonia as well, 
  it 's still dumb that the mods do n't mention why and when they remove popular submission in the comments, 
  hey i 'm just an advertising guy , obviously we need a few military experts onboard this startup enterprise as well . 
  that said they could be useful for raids on the shores of libya sandbagging boats before they leave the shores, 
  someone had the right idea when they said we should crowdfund it . 
  our * leaders * will surely get the point when have enough money pledged to buy and man the mistral ships to kick pirate ass with a private army in the mediterranean . 
  why ca n't we just get some millionaire to buy a pirate ship and be the hero europe needs right now . 
  oh wait , the richest in society probably love this, 
  nobody can be held responsible foe somebody elses private corruption . 
  damm a lot of people seem to be unable to understand sarcasm in these comments, 
  the guy was only obeying subreddit rules by using the same title as that on youtube . 
  if the mods wanted they would have told him to resubmit it with a different title if this was the only issue .

  essentially any such official diplomatic mission is under pretty much de facto diplomatic immunity to such things . 
  the options for receiving country are pretty much refuse the meeting and tell the other side to go home or tolerate them . 
  one ca n't exactly throw any foreign government officials like mps or ministers on an official government visit to jail . 
  if they travel there as private persons , sure it would apply . 
  as part of diplomatic delegation , they are pretty much de facto diplomatic immune , even if not technically officially so as accredited diplomat . 
  of course there calculation here is , which side needs wich more or which side wants to make the negotiations smooth . 
  for example technically they might not need to or want to wear hijab , but the diplomatic calculation was that having iranians on good mood was more important than their principles on this matter . 
  or they do n't mind or really have that strong principles on it . 
  of course there is the political calculation , which now bites them . 
  bending apparent principle matters for diplomatic reasons , makes one 's home turf think how stead fast those principles really are . 
  yeah . 
  it is tragically funny frankly . 
  like first an foremost that is that bad negotiating on european countries . 
  essentially willingly making themselves officially dependent of usa ( which gives huge diplomatic leverage to usa ) , when eu members easily as combined entity is enough to guarantee eu 's safety . 
  yeah . 
  like say declare that lisbon 42.7 means what it means and it will hold . 
  frankly eu does n't need usa . 
  even the current european forces could easily repel an russian attack ( which is highly unlike ) . 
  just make it clear russia has to fight whole eu , if they start messing around in eu territory and they wo n't attack . 
  it anyway makes more sense to have closer intra europe defense co-operation , rather than eu usa co-operation . 
  purely on geographic grounds . 
  as certain ww showed , europe can be bombed to pile of rubble and it does n't affect american daily life . 
  however it does affect rest of europe directly . 
  so it makes sense to do common european defense , than intra-atlantic defense , since other european nations have vested interest to not only have enough strength to win a defense , but to prevent attack in first place . 
  since be the war in anywhere in europe , it will affect rest of europe . 
  like say new old plan lisbon 42.7 . 
  ai n't people happy now greece demanded that written in in case turkey attacks . 
  handy to have multiple security co-operation organizations . 
  avoids the all eggs in one basket problem . 
  pensioners in general . 
  from all over europe . 
  moving to spain for old days ( atleast part time ) is a very well known thing here in finland . 
  probably true for most northern eu countries also . 
  sun and warmth nothing more to it really ( + spain is common vacation spot to begin with among finns so it 's familiar . 
  problem is counter propaganda is still propaganda and now a days people seem to have short tolerance for propaganda from any side or anykind . 
  like my first question was `` is russia trying to get le pen elected '' or `` is dgse trying to get le pen not elected '' . 
  dgse is also an intelligence agency and frankly at the moment my trust for intelligence agencies from anyside , including my own , is negative million . 
  just like russia can do disinformation warfare , so can france and dgse . 
  of course it would be way more gross violation of principles , if dgse intentionally tried to affect their own nations election result . 
  of course it is also possible dgse is being honest , but as said i trust no one be it americans , russians , french or finns as it comes to intelligence agencies . 
  those agencies have got their hand caught in the political cookie jar couple times too many to be trusted . 
  pretty sure we finns would prefer accepting organized refugee quota , than uncontrolled refugee overflow from russia , sweden and norway . 
  i was a bit of a shit show in tornio , when the flood began . 
  as in call army to help organize emergency tent housing etc. 
  levels of chaos . 
  far easier to organize refugee handling when one would at least get like a weeks forewarning on the amounts involved . 
  do we like massive flood of refugees , no , but if it is to happen , let it be damn organized flood at least . 
  pretty sure most of finland and finnish politicians here are practical and down to earth enough to know , there is no stopping this flood . 
  this involves forces literally beyond control even whole of eu ( like multiple wars not involving eu ) or even human kind ( like climate patterns shifting ) . 
  is it controversial . 
  absolutely , any issue of this scale is . 
  beyond rational talk ? 
  maybe for true finns , but mostly all the other groups and the government `` machine '' is concerned with far more practical and day to day issues , like how to feed and house the refugees . 
  since we ca n't exactly leave them in -20 c freeze in a tent village . 
  did anybody like when the refugee flood started ? 
  no , but at least in finland i think the reality of the situations absolute inevitability has set in and mostly the question is now practical handling of the situation with minimum chaos and disturbance to the operation finland ( been running for almost a century now . ) . 
  and no random anybody just walking , flying etc. 
  to the country and saying `` i want to move to finland '' wo n't get finnish ubi automatically ( since they just do n't get to automatically move in with residency to finland ) , so no we are n't exactly concerned about that . 
  more we are conserved with what the born and bred humans inside do with that ubi . 
  hence why there is ** experiment ** running . 
  no but the overall touch might be little more patient . 
  this is a good tactic . 
  it shows people care about the police . 
  if people care about police , police care about people . 
  if police care about people , people care about police . 
  it is a mutual symbiotic relationship . 
  neither can get respect from the other without given it back . 
  gesture like this is n't about what happened last night or what happens next night . 
  doing this kind of gesture will in general build a good relation between groups . 
  people must understand police has job to do and police has to understand people walking on protest are there for a reason , so they wo n't just disappear conveniently when told to , because being inconvinient is one major way protests work . 
  the solution is to make sure public education is not shit at teaching critical thinking . 
  so the solution is not less education , but more and better education . 
  i in no way implied the current situation is a good and sustainable situation in this regard . 
  mostly the problem is ... ahem ... some democracies politicians are reluctant to put resources in critical thinking education , because for it to work against manipulation by outsiders , there ca n't be off switch . 
  which means once you turn on that critical thinking effort , also their own political manipulations and machinations get spotted by the new more critical population . 
  frankly people should realize in a democracy the vulnerability of the whole general population to political and ideological manipulation is a matter of ** national security ** . 
  just like nation needs military armor and defense against military threats , it needs mental , political and ideological defense against manipulation and foreign nefarious influencing . 
  in case of democracy that means armoring every citizen against being conned by foreign agitators and manipulators . 
  only problem is that armoring works against domestic threats also . 
   so is nato still necessary ? 
  for eu ? 
  technically not . 
  practically yes for sometime , since the necessary practical work to make 42.7 credible deterrent is just starting aka closer ** eu ** lead defense co-operation and coordination in europe . 
  essentially eu is taking step to make sure nato is redundant and not necessary in future for european common defense , incase nato in future fails eu . 
  eu is very much about common shared redundancies for unlikely events , which eu members have no resources to do alone . 
  case in point galileo , which was solely done as a redundancy move for gps . 
  europe was 99 % sure they could trust usa on gps availability , but to get that last 1 % of certainty in case of extremely unlikely scenario eu spent billions of euros . 
  just in case . 
  ( plus to support european space industry and technology development ) . 
  just like 42.7 it is one of those `` just in case '' things of eu . 
  actually written initially mostly on the pressuring greece , because nato member greece , feared nato member turkey would attack it . 
  reason , see cyprus . 
  since nato does n't involve itself with internato wars , greece wanted secures from rest of eu , that should greece get attacked by turkey , rest of the european nato members would n't just sit idly by ,, 
  treaty of lisbon is an eu treaty and 42.7 is one of it 's articles . 
  for simplicity here is what it says :  mutual defence clause ( article 42.7 teu )  if a member state is the victim of armed aggression on its territory , the other member states shall have towards it an obligation of aid and assistance by all the means in their power , in accordance with article 51 of the united nations charter . 
  this shall not prejudice the specificcharacter of the security and defence policy of certain member states . 
   commitments and cooperation in this area shall be consistent with commitments under the north atlantic treaty organisation , which , for those states which are members of it , remains the foundation of their collective defence and the forum for its implementation . 
  finland could n't exactly expect nato to honor it 's military alliance with finland , since there is no official alliance between nato and finland . 
  nato has zero legal obligation towards finland , unlike eu and it 's members . 
  those have obligation to aid finland in defense in case finland is attacked .

oh , wow i am stupid . 
  you live in the 80 's ? 
  the strong and capable men should go back to their country and fight their wars instead of fleeing and then complaining that the country which took them was n't `` good '' enough ... 
  oh those poor elementary school students , i feel bad for them . 
  swedish since 7th was already pain in the ass . 
  it did change . 
  if you attend a proper finnish schools then you will always learn english from 4th grade and swedish from 7th . 
  swedish should be banned anyway , it 's a waste of time and could be used to learn some other more useful language . 
  english is always forced in the 4th grade . 
  swedish is forced in 7th grade and in some cases you can skip it completely if your reason is good enough, 
  that 's only 19th and 20th century , most countries had problems at the time . 
  why not go even further back in time ? 
  their history is fascinating . 
  finnish is much harder . 
  there is this tool called photoshop which can create very realistic pictures . 
  how come when it comes to these articles , people deny that programs existence ?

  ` murican troll please . 
  go ` murica someplace else . 
  seriously why the hell do you think i am russian ? 
  everyone with a different opinion is from russia ? 
  that 's some fucked up logic , mate . 
  kind of like us has been for quite some time, 
  millions of people dying from both sides is wet dream of americans ? 
  you americans are some fucked up people ... 
  dude ... 
  i do not understand that comment . 
  the moon landing was faked !!!!!!, 
  media freedom in sweden ? 
  please ... 
  ever since the muslim problem , free speech is long gone . 
  any negative or truthful news and opinions on the immigration are censored and removed . 
  people are raped but the government covers it all up to make sure that the muslims remain `` the good guys '' ... 
  just stereotypes or are the japanese really that retarded ? 
  in russian you pronounce it like `` t\u0161ehia '' , so it makes sense . 
  it sounds weird because of english , but in slavic languages it totally makes sense . 
  there is little evidence backing the claim that putin is a multi-billionaire . 
  most likely made up bullshit to make him look even worse than he already is . 
  how exactly is it giving a finger to russkies ? 
  it 's more like shooting yourself in the foot . 
  staling was not russian nor did he like russians . 
  millions of ukrainians and russians and pretty much everyone else died because of him . 
  i 'd say this is a middle finger to georgia . 
  like ukraine is doing any better . 
  still is , not as much , but expensive . 
  what is usa even doing here ? 
  wow , i had no idea . 
  i guess you learn new things every day . 
  i am pretty sure when lenin was alive , there were no memes . 
  are n't you spanish ? 
  both come from both sides . 
  just because it 's not shown on bbc , fox , and cnn , does n't mean it does n't exist ... 
  well , as you can see we can look at this situation both ways . 
  both sides release credible proof and bullshit proof . 
  so how come the western media is right while russian wrong ? 
  and that 's important because ... ? 
  you do know that satellite pictures are literally the easiest proofs you can possibly fake , you do n't even need to be a professional photoshop user . 
  most of the time nato `` provides factual evidence '' , it 's just some random important guy claiming something when interviewed by a big media outlet . 
  while russian sources have videos and pictures of things happening there . 
  commies *, 
  you know if someone attacks your country for no reason and nobody out there wants to help you , except one country who is also in a war against your enemy , what do you do ? 
  tell them to fuck off or accept their help and equipment when you are running out of your own ? 
  also about the independence , russian empire ceased to exist , so obviously we were no longer part of it . 
  and since no country had control over us anymore , we became independent . 
  our independence was signed by the russian provisional government that got into power for a few months after nikolai 's death and before bolsheviks took control . 
  those same bolsheviks who took control of the country and created soviet-russian , also supported and equipped the commies in finland . 
  we owed germany for helping us in our civil war , during winter war nobody wanted to help us except those good old germans , they already helped us against the same enemy once , so why not again ? 
  our government was never influenced by nazis or anything , we merely fought with them against ussr to keep our independence . 
  you can thank me for this history lesson later . 
  well considering that ussr attacked finland for no reason and before that , tried to install a commie government by funding a civil war . 
  we have our reasons for revenge . 
  actually finns didnt go that far . 
  we stopped once we got our old border back . 
  that ended up being a good move because stalin did n't accuse mannerheim for any war crime after the war ended , not attacking leningrad might have been one of the reasons . 
  finland never collaborated with the nazis , we were a free democracy that got invaded by the commies for no reason , `` argueforthesakeofit '' . 
  they banned the communist party because the last time it was allowed , it led to a civil war and also because everyone hates commies . 
  but i guess you are just arguing for the sake it . 
  nooo do n't leave . 
  i really wanted to go to uk in the future for studies ... 
  it 's apparently a big thing in the islamic world as well . 
  then you did n't understand what was said in the video . 
  then that means you did n't watch the video . 
  you do n't even understand the language or anything that was said in the video . 
  your opinion ca n't be taken seriously . 
  did n't really happen as you described it . 
  he was n't beat up and he was n't even criticizing putin , but ramzan kadyrov . 
  and that video of him on a treadmill was uploaded to facebook and ig , he did n't do it on tv . 
  link ? 
  most countries probably , but i would guess that it does n't happen in a place like saudi arabia very often . 
  the country is also right next to me , yet for some reason i am not scared . 
  you live in a 90 celsius climate ? 
  imperial russians were n't all that bad , it 's the red commies that were hated . 
  well they did kinda build helsinki . 
  oltermanni is heavenly . 
  food from the gods themselves . 
  there are always exceptions . 
  but generally a small country with a small population will have a much easier time developing and taking care of it 's people when there are n't hundreds of millions of them . 
  that too obviously . 
  but corruption does n't just come out of thin air and i bet if corruption disappeared tomorrow , most issues in russia would not go anywhere . 
  reading that makes so angry .

  on android i 've heard of anything between 90-99 % of the downloads for paid games being pirated . 
  there 's just so many games , many of them free that people are not willing to pay much for something they have n't gotten a chance to try . 
  it also depends on what kind of game it is . 
  some games are more like services nowadays that are constantly updated and meant to last for years . 
  for that kind of games , the pay once model does n't work too well in the long run .

  funny when it 's a white woman , everyone ( even some people here in the comments ) go to great efforts to paint her as a * victim * , how she 's been `` seduced to join in '' but if it was a muslim man most people would want them the exact same treatment as these evil worthless vermin have given to all those people ( including children ) they 've tortured , beheaded , buried alive or raped .

  or what if it 's a young woman with a flat chest ?

  i 'm not saying and i do n't think you 're going to stone infidels and gays because i do n't think you take the bible as fundamentally as you think you do . 
  but hey , that 's just my opinion . 
  as an atheist , i actually agree with you that being a `` moderate christian '' ( or muslim/jew ) makes one either ignorant or a cherry picking hypocrite but to take the bible ** literally ** and putting into action what is told in the book ( gods commands to kill certain groups of people ) ? 
  that makes you a misogynistic , homophobic , racist ethnic cleanser and a religious terrorist . 
  people who actually have read the bible also know that jesus said that all those horrible laws of the old testament are still valid for his followers .

  i agree but in many western and asian countries the birth count is already near or below replacement level . 
  population growth is mostly driven by africa right now . 
  child mortality has decreased a lot though ( which is great news ) , that 's why the population is growing as much as it is . 
  but if there were less babies then more resources could be put on the babies that are born . 
  i would n't call it inhumane , it 's way more humane than having 10 children and seeing how many of them can make it past the age of 5 ... not to mention in many countries in africa , women do n't really have a say in whether to have more children or not . 
  there might be no contraceptives available and rape is common ( if it happens inside marriage it often wont even be considered rape ) . 
  you can not make that comparison when [ large parts of africa are uninhabitable desert ] ( http://sedac.ciesin.columbia.edu/gpw-v2/images/africa.gif ) etc. . . 
  sadly with climate change it 's only going to get worse . 
  i believe sterilization after 2nd or 3rd child birth would be a fair way to prevent overpopulation getting out of hand , protect the climate and save millions of children from otherwise certain death . 
  `` routinely siding with palestinian terrorists '' is a bit extreme way to put it , but i feel like you 're using a strawman here , u/misgenderedrhino did n't state what his/her stance is in regards to the settlements . 
  i 'm pro-israel in the sense that i think israel has a right to exist as a nation , jews have a right to exist as people and they have a right to defend their own people ( do not forget they 're also protecting peaceful arabs/palestinians working or living in israel ) . 
  at the same time i 'm anti-settlement . 
  but on the other side you have terrorist groups like hamas that want to completely wipe israel off the map . 
  you have [ childrens tv shows about `` shooting all jews '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oram-usqhq ) , you have [ 67 % of the population supporting stabbing attacks on civilian jews ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/palestinianauthority/12051848/more-than-two-thirds-of-palestinians-support-knife-attacks-against-israelis.html ) , [ there 's parents training toddlers to stab jews ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzwpfvrsgqq ) ...

  finland can into southern europe !, 
  fyi european jews make up less than half of all israelis . 
  many jews from the middle east moved there because it got dangerous to be a jew where they used to live . 
  many europeans moved there after legally buying land from local landlords in the ottoman empire way before ww2 . 
  take a look at the timeline picture i posted . 
  the region has been under numerous different rulers and had different majorities , sometimes jews , sometimes christians , sometimes muslims . 
  there are no agreed rules that people can use to claim their right to a piece of land . 
  after the collapse of the ottoman empire many new arab/muslim majority countries were formed by * british/french literally drawing lines on a map of middle east * ( this is partially why the region is such a mess even today ) but yet you 're only questioning the legitimity of a tiny jewish country formed with un approval ? 
  https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/timeline/c2f393d98db94b4fe8cc220015eb346a.png pulling things out of context is convenient but ignores : 1 .

  that there never was a state called palestine 3 .

  and when they air tv shows teaching kids how all jews must be killed ... big part of the problem is that both israel and palestine have their own crazy religious people and extremists .

  yes there is . 
  bacteria evolving a resistance to antibiotics , which ( although being bad news for humans ) is clearly a positive for the bacteria . 
  natural selection . 
  changes and mutations are random but the bad ones do not make it in the end . 
  bacteria without resistance gets killed off by antibiotics so only those with resistance survive . 
  sometimes neutral features will also stay . 
  this is why whales still have bones for fingers even though they 're now useless . 
  no i just gave you evidence . 
  get yourself mrsa and try to treat it with methicillin . 
  you did n't give any concerns but i 'm interested to hear them . 
  also you just contradicted yourself . 
  in your first comment you said evolution is `` a completely unproven theory '' but now you suddenly accept there 's overwhelming evidence in support of it ? 
  i hope you 're trolling . 
  evolution theory = / = evolution in pokemon , you idiot ... 
  so what is your alternative theory , may i ask ? 
  god shaped different breeds of dogs out of clay ? 
  when you go to a doctor and it is found you have methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus ( mrsa ) , you can choose between the new or old antibiotics , you choose the old antibiotics because you refuse to believe that the bacteria has gained resistance to that kind of antibiotics through changes in its dna ( evolution ) ? 
  let me put it this way : do you believe that dna exists ? 
  do you believe that changes can happen in the dna ? 
  if you answer yes to both , then you already have accepted evolution . 
  because evolution is just bunch of these changes over long periods of time and `` species '' is just a human concept to classify creatures with similar ( but not the same ! ), 
  genes into groups according to certain criteria . 
  not really . 
  the `` more extreme wing '' gained ground ( or as many put it `` completely took over/hijacked the party '' ) but only ** within ** the finns party . 
  the party itself has lost half of its voters during the last 2 years . 
  will be interesting to see whether they will gain or lose votes and members with the changes . 
  with the refugee crisis there definitely was a spike in racist movement but that situation has calmed down a lot . 
  of course there 's still great concern about how to prevent terrorism but i would n't call it racism . 
  i mean , i 've seen many statements and blog posts from people with an immigrant/refugee/muslim background publicly being very worried about terrorism , radicalism and even integration issues . 
  i doubt there will be any bills about gay marriage . 
  it actually would 've been easier to do it with the finns party since they have way more seats than christian democrats . 
  yet they made clear that they 're not going to try and change it . 
  remember that the citizens initiative against gay marriage was quickly rejected .

  i think that it can be very impressive , but only in the correct context and when executed with the greatest care .

  traditionally when the fighting has a political , religious or other societal motive , we tend to talk about it , yes . 
  for example , if a bunch of drunks have a fistfight in a bar - that is n't news . 
  but if a bunch of neo-nazis attack a synagogue - that is news . 
  it was n't that long ago that politicians here in finland were talking enthusiastically about turkey joining the european union . 
  they are n't talking about that now ... 
  ** w ** inland and ** b ** estonia !, 
  i would guess that they were arrested for a `` political protest action '' . 
  in russia , any political protest of more than one single person needs an official permit . 
  if the policeman was a dick , he could decide that these two leaving flowers and a sign of condolences was a political protest . 
  the gay propaganda law is also possible , but much less likely - that only concerns acts of promoting homosexuality to underage minors . 
  it is difficult to see how leaving flowers and a sign could be seen as promoting homosexuality . 
  [ oh , how sad ... ] ( http://www.philosophers-stone.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/jump-you-fuckers.jpg ), 
  i would support this if we also limited the refugees to only real refugees from real war-zones , not opportunists from north africa .

  president ? 
  but some kind of political career is perfectly possible . 
  this incident has made her a very well-known figure and a war-hero in ukraine . 
  while she was imprisoned for almost two years , the political scene in ukraine has been a total clusterfuck . 
  the political elite is mired in corruption scandals and their incompetence and weakness is frustrating the nation . 
  in the mean time , she has steadfastly sat in prison and refused to admit any wrongdoing - as she should n't have . 
  but boy does that make the current crop of ukrainian politicians seem like a bunch of weaklings : this woman faced down the putin administration and refused to plea-bargain her way out from under a possible 20-year prison sentence - all the while the ukrainian politicians have been fucking up and hiding their money in panama . 
  this gives her considerable moral clout . 
  she was held in captivity for seven hundred and eight days . 
  that 's a lot of time to think about politics and build up resentment towards her supposed superiors . 
  if she has the inclination and can find a decent team , she has the potential to throw some serious weight around . 
  that all sounds rather wonderful to me . 
  you are basically describing a responsible left-wing that has both a brain to keep their policies practical and non-destructive and a pair of balls to do something about violent extremism and immigrant integration . 
  that sounds bloody delightful , i 'd be totally on board with that . 
  regrettably , most of the left-leaning rhetoric i hear these days is rather a far cry from that . 
  that might sound appealing for a moment , but when you think about it for a bit it would n't be so great . 
  first , the various pirate parties are mostly formed out of political outsiders - people completely new to politics . 
  they also seem to be mostly formed out of technologists - people with some excellent ideas about it privacy laws and patent reform and government regulation of the internet ... but i ca n't see myself trusting these people to handle the illegal migration crisis any better than the current political class . 
  do n't get me wrong , i rather like the pirate party , but i see little reason to believe they will improve matters on this issue . 
  secondly , we have the greens . 
  well , the greens are n't green any more , they are red . 
  after the fall of the soviet union the commies merged leftism into the green movement . 
  they are a far worse option than the pirate party people , who at the very least have plenty of sense . 
  the greens are n't going to do a damn thing about the migrant crisis ; they 're lefty globalist-internationalists who think european taxpayers should pay to save the whole damn earth . 
  they 'll embrace * willkommenskultur * even more enthusiastically than the current lot . 
  there is a great deal to dislike in the right wing - and i certainly hope the power does n't go to the truly far-right - but they are the better option .

  apparently this number comes from frontex and there is a link to http://frontex.europa.eu/trends-and-routes/migratory-routes-map/ given as the source , but that frontex website is so god damn baffling that i ca n't find it .

   i am not for killing all muslims in europe well , i 'm quite certain no one is suggesting anything so barbaric . 
  we simply need proper border controls to stop fake refugees and well-funded intelligence services to root out the lone wolves .

   if we become weak then it wo n't be good for us . 
  this does n't mean that we have to have common taxation or common budget in europe , in my mind . 
  eu could have a common voice in just some policy areas . 
  maybe . 
  i feel that the same goes for companies too . 
  it 's always easier to lay off people in far away countries . 
  i could see that the `` london a-holes '' would feel more their own than the `` brussels a-holes '' . 
  i might be wrong though . 
  it could be called `` the bilderbergs '' . 
  how about `` people 's republic of europe '' ? 
  edit . 
  i should have read the comments further . 
  and not just in name . 
  who * should * go first in this years nhl draft ? 
  there is also an eu directive limiting the size of strawmen . 
  the netherlands also has low taxes and a skilled ( mostly ) english speaking workforce . 
  it 's also on european continent ( but i guess the brits do n't want that ) . 
  and he does n't have to do it alone . 
  great point , but there might be a painful time of adjustment before income division is agreed on . 
   no , but lawmaker might choose to force it . 
  yes , but as a typical lawmaker , who do you listen more , the soon-to-be-unemployed folks , or the businessman who finances your campaign ? 
  i hope we do n't have to go close to mad max - society before we see the lawmakers act . 
  i hear there has to be some amount of threat of violence for refugee status , but if one can hook up a job in a tough jobs market , basically anyone is welcome . 
  thanks , that 's interesting . 
  there always has to be someone to maintain and plan the machines . 
  ( and do the sales and managing ) let 's hope it 's us . 
  there always has to be someone who finances it . 
  i hope all companies do n't end up in tax havens when automation spreads . 
  there 's an element of gift in a bailout . 
  first they got to take large risks , then they got bailed out , and mostly , got to keep their large bonuses . 
  it 's potential rewards for the bankers , risks socialized to tax payers . 
  the alternatives are lacking , i guess . 
  political experience , or sometimes sensible policies in some area of politics . 
  and some people just stop voting , which leaves the power to the old parties . 
  the finnish and german greens differ then . 
  at least in being conservative and pro police . 
  what would you call it ? 
  in my mind , some other top managers made pretty bad decisions too . 
  and the creativity was n't there anymore , i guess . 
  i have for long voted for the `` least bad '' party . 
  by the way , has there been criminal/some other kind of investigation on the politicians who run your economy to shitter like this ? 
  or maybe they are from `` untouchable '' families ? 
  ... who should be punished , put have they been ? 
  they very well might have more facts than us , but for who 's benefit are they going to use them ? 
  that 's a good question . 
  i 'd say the ones for the migration movement do n't believe the cultural compatibility is an issue , or do n't care . 
  another reason might be that it is just suitable because these guys are coming now , and the ones from more compatible cultures and with more suitable skill sets are not ( to my country at least ) , in similar amounts . 
  the big business also benefits greatly of building housing and services for the migrants , and these are financed by tax money , argued to the public by the politicians . 
  it 's low risk business . 
  ok , my bad then . 
  could have googled also . 
  yes , i should have added `` in practice '' . 
  i think it 's most interesting how the process habitually goes . 
  how the heck can that cost the alleged 39 million ? 
  helsinki administration , holy cow ... 
  the chair of the top-voted party will be the prime minister in my country . 
  did we know that much about juncker before eu elections ? 
  it 's probably also about bringing in potential low-pay workers for big business . 
  who gave him the right not to work with democratically elected european politicians ? 
  the austrians are not some kind of crazies , they elect who they want , and juncker deals with it . 
   the eu enforcing rule of law their idea of rule of law . 
  who gets to decide who are far-right ? 
  yes , them . 
  this does n't sound democratic at all . 
  i hate the direction the eu has taken . 
  juncker is just one guy in the eu power machine . 
  well , it 's not the easiest of jobs . 
   even if you butcher the language to some degree do n't worry , we most certainly will !, 
   at least the economic migrants we are getting right now are prmlimarily interested in finding a job quickly . 
  the ones we are getting either * mostly * are n't , or are not finding it . 
  the employment % are 15-30 % , if you count also people who have been here for decade + . 
  we can help financially , help setting up and running the camps . 
  helping in africa/middle east would be cheaper anyways . 
  merkel and her big business buddies can go to the camps , and handpick the workers for germany , if they think that 's going to work . 
  i understood the discussion was about more than one north african country . 
  the ones that do n't have anything , or are in crisis themselves , some economic incentive/political pressure - combo might be thought of . 
  most of the migrants are not originally from libya though , they are coming through libya . 
  often people vote for the charismatic , not the most competent . 
  competence can be hard to detect , before elections at least . 
  excellent post . 
  that does n't sound all that bad . 
   no native norwegian was convicted as the prosecutor could not prove a native norwegian with a job to have a reason to commit rape , this ca n't be the real reasoning for a verdict . 
  there must be some kind of misunderstanding . 
  do n't you think north african countries can set up camps to keep the migrants alive ? 
  the people coming to europe do n't have any special right to come here . 
  they can be helped elsewhere . 
  maybe use some economic sanctions ? 
  does n't europe have any political weight anymore , or are they just not willing to use it ? 
  maybe they just love marabou and handelsbanken ? 
  ( before marabou was sold , and who loves nordea ? ), 
  they will just repeat that hofer is literally hitler , for weeks . 
  the reader/watcher will never learn how it actually is . 
  ( i have no idea of the guy either ), 
  did you know that there was going to be borders that would be this open * outwards * , when you voted ? 
  i did n't . 
   what do you think sweden and finland would do if russia attacked nato ? 
  on the other hand , what are the odds , that russia attacked nato countries , but not finland ? 
  or that if finland would be attacked , no one else in the region would ? 
  it would escalate . 
  there is still a lot of firepower in europe even if it did n't act in total unison .

  some of their ancestors did come from sweden and so did some of mine too , before their offspring switched to speaking finnish in my case . 
  but a lot of their ancestry does come from finnish speakers who integrated , and , especially around helsinki , emigrants from germany , russia , and the uk . 
  there 's is n't really a feeling of swedishness ( as in belonging to the country of sweden ) , as most of them either feel just as finnish as everybody else or belonging to a linguistic minority within finland . 
  in all honesty , the polish airforces do operate both mi-8 's and mi-24 's so there is plenty of room for mistakes . 
  as we can see , it does n't seem to work . 
  no , krisse virtanen from gothenburg , sweden , is a sverigefinne / - finl\u00e4ndare . 
  toffe str\u00f6mmer from eken\u00e4s , finland , is a finlandssvensk . 
  mark levengood , an actual real person , born in helsinki , finland , but residing in stockholm , sweden , is a sverigefinlandssvensk . 
  home country first , mother tongue second . 
  just walking my merry way to the town in small town washington state . 
  shit 's hard when you do n't have a driver 's license . 
  now i do , but then again , i live on this side of the pond again and i hardly ever need it . 
  a lot of people who smoke or have smoked pick it up in the army . 
  it 's everywhere there because you can get a nicotine rush even when there 's not enough time to smoke . 
   companies even were able to sue the eu into them not having to print cancer warnings on the packages : the eu could n't produce a single study that showed an increased risk . 
  not even mad . 
  that 's pretty impressive . 
  but this does n't include finland because fuck you . 
  sverigefinl\u00e4ndare are the ones who moved to sweden . 
  and that includes some sverigefinlandssvenskar who , despite the name , are n't one bit swedish . 
  edit . 
  definitely . 
  and build some sidewalks and pedestrian paths . 
  what the heck up with having to walk down the side of the road . 
  that 's dangerous . 
  and everyone seems to be in a disagreement on which side of the road you should walk . 
  i 've had people driving by yell at me regardless of what side i was walking on . 
  usually if both parties speak swedish and are aware that they both do , people to have a tendency to speak that . 
  it 's to do with the identity . 
  but if there 's someone whose swedish is weak or if the convo started in finnish , they will stick to finnish . 
  source : hedershurri, 
  our society is n't as car-reliant ( i 've lived in the us , too , so i know ) and it helps to pay for stuff , so it 's okay . 
  ah , that explains it the pretty sauna . 
  the gas prices have come down dramatically here too . 
  they used to be at 1.6 $ / liter , and using pre-crimea exchange rates , that 's us$ 8.50 / gallon . 
  oh my god , our german teacher showed these in our class too . 
  they 're so terrible . 
  edit : and why does the turkish guy eat ham ? 
  everyone has a sauna here . 
  you ca n't survive without one . 
  220k for a house like that sounds very decent to me . 
  anywhere within 50 km of helsinki , it would be twice that . 
  within 15 km , three times . 
   with 2 incomes in the household ( assuming ops so was working before the baby came ) for a single story house in the suburb aint too luxurious in finland . 
  depends on where in finland . 
  down here in the south , you need to be wealthy to live in a house . 
  in ostrobothnia , like is the case with this regular guy , practically everyone lives in a house . 
  i 'm guessing there 's a bit of inheritance from poppa . 
  the sauna is spanking new and renovated . 
  sauna goals , rather . 
  it 's in there . 
  those are not a thing in finland . 
  no , it 's not fantastic . 
  none of this is fantastic . 
  saying that you love it is beyond fucked up . 
  this vessel you 're talking about is basically an amphibious dock . 
  it has armament for self-defense only . 
  this does n't mean that finland does n't beat the netherlands in the number of patrol boats , mine vessels , and the total number of ships . 
  finland is n't allowed to operate subs but our sonars are precise enough to pick out individual fish , i 've been told . 
   you 're not even a part of nato i wish we were since an eu army does n't exist . 
  at least yet . 
   your army has nowhere near the capabilities , experience or knowledge of the dutch army whoa there . 
  the dutch military is small . 
  we have more than twice the number of active personnel per capita ( 14000 short of nl 's 50000 ) , not to mention our reserves . 
  we have a larger navy , comparable air forces , way better artillery ... just because you participated in korea does n't make your military experienced . 
  and let 's not forget comparing our two countries in wwii . 
  2 % is an unenforced nato requirement , and should either the bern or the donald be the next us president , they 've promised to make sure you guys pay that much . 
  the truth is , the dutch military is in a severe state of disrepair . 
  as we can read in the article , two thirds of the dutch army were handed over to germany under the guise of integration . 
  you need to spend this money . 
  i agree , avionics was probably a poor choice of words . 
  i meant the entirety of the russian aviation industry . 
  in the case of war , all of them would obviously be sent to poland but the netherlands need to keep them operational and train their crews with them . 
  and finland has conscription . 
  2 % is plenty . 
  that 's just a radar . 
  performance is key . 
  and so is reliability . 
  russian planes and choppers have always been very unreliable . 
  it also means `` well '' in latin and italian . 
  russia would never give their most advanced piece of tech to finland this early . 
  not that pak fa would be absolutely outstanding , because , well , russian avionics . 
  i dig the sound of bene deluxe more . 
  integration is undeniably very good . 
  however , what 's being done is less integration and more giving away the entire national defense because the nl ca n't be bothered to maintain its own . 
  that 's not good at all . 
  seriously , you guys have literally no tanks . 
  thanks , holland , for the cheap leopards , but you guys could 've really used them yourselves . 
  having tons of experience with what finland can do with 1.5 % of the gdp , the dutch , with a high population density and small land area , could really achieve greatness with 2 % . 
  every time we beat them in hockey . 
  finnish people just like to call you guys `` tshekit '' or `` the czechs , '' as in `` i was in the czechs last weekend . '', 
  that is , indeed , a radical theory . 
  i need to watch that documentary tomorrow . 
  in the finnish military , we used the euphemism `` yellow state . '', 
  truly no style whatsoever . 
  i did n't even realize that there was such a thing as a german refugee to denmark . 
  there were a lot of finnish refugees to sweden ( mostly children ) , my grandmother was one of them , so it makes sense . 
  the forceful nationalization of russian media happens to coincide pretty well with it . 
  it * is * tasty . 
  what the fuck , man .

  im not doubting it , but i havent seen any concrete evidence that it happened . 
  i dont . 
   it only happened in spite of logical arguments because of nationalism . 
  maybe the brits just got fed up with the problems eu has and felt that it goes against their interests ? 
  im not for or against brexit personally by the way . 
  as i posted in another thread , nationalism isnt the `` enemy of eu '' unless they make it into one by antagonizing nationalists across europe in an attempt to scapegoat and blame nationalism for the euroskeptic sentiments . 
  eu needs to take a less antagonizing approach to this . 
  after all , eu is mainly composed of nation states . 
  for a large part of europes population , nationalism equals patriotism . 
  i guess generally the values of a constitutional state and valuing human rights . 
  other than that its a bit of a cliche . 
  sometimes its used to signify values that may be promoted by eu or individual eurofederalist political parties but in reality are the values of a rather small clique rather than being the norm across europe . 
  blaming nationalism for brexit and the growing euroskeptic sentiment is counterproductive . 
  its essentially scapegoating and self-deception , going for the easy target instead of using their brains and addressing the issues eu has . 
   the failure to push the project forward during a decade of economic slump had fuelled a re-emergence of `` blinkered nationalism '' i dont understand this stuck-up mindset that condemns nationalism as invariably anti-eu . 
  eu ( the comission specifically ) should embrace the fact that nationalism is a thing and its not the enemy unless they make it into one by antagonizing people with nationalist sentiments across europe . 
  nationalism might be viewed badly in some member states ( for example germany ) but in many other member states its absolutely normal and doesnt necessarily carry the connotation that nationalism = anti-eu, 
   the-eu-did-not-contribute-to-peace narrative is a populist stock argument tbh its impossible to say how big of a role eu playing in the relative peace that europe has had . 
  there was a bunch of other factors too that propably had a bigger impact than eu . 
  sure , eu did have some effect in it though  the argument is invented for the express purpose of discrediting the eu . 
  its pretty safe to say that some people do exaggerate the effect eu had on the more or less sustained peace there has been . 
  it was the result of several different factors , not just eu . 
   i do n't go to r/uk to pest about the british empire and british war mongering , do i ? 
  i was under the impression that this sub is for discussing matters involving europe , regardless of your opinion on the eu or brexit . 
  does criticizing eu make you unwelcome here in your opinion or what ? 
  come on . 
   very cloying and dulcet , but the cringing in enhanced by how unintentionally parochial the entire thing comes across . 
  these guys think of themselves as cosmopolitans ; yet they believe the reason the eu is the reason why people live abroad or there are french cheese and italian wines on the shelves . 
  i 'm tempted to invite him to drop by zurich so we can visit a supermarket . 
  which part of this was `` right-wing '' ? 
  the criticism he expressed is not restricted to rightwingers . 
  i wouldnt go and categorize people like that, 
   it is completely pointless to try to argue with a brexitter . 
  no reason can penetrate inside that shell . 
  it 's a complete waste of time . 
  lol . 
  criticism of certain aspects of the eu dont make you a brexitter this sort of mentality you expressed is why more and more people dig themselves into their ideological foxholes, 
  well look whos fearmongering now, 
   it 's no surprise that this project has come under a lot of strain recently in turkey . 
  akp purposely wrecked ataturks legacy, 
   who the fuck is organising these protests ? 
  its called slacktivism, 
  same with your comment . 
  that just comes off as very arrogant . 
  i think its a massive oversimplification to blame nationalism for the world wars . 
  you said his post was `` right-wing '' . 
  why ? 
  also , i didnt `` equate it with invalid '' . 
  i * asked * you if you did . 
  no one is putting words in your mouth , stop victimizing yourself, 
   if you have your own opinion lead with that instead rather than trying to fabricate one for me so you can tear it down . 
  thats why i asked you what you base your allegation on and whether you think that it makes the opinion less valid . 
  you didnt answer either , instead you went and accused me of making a straw man . 
  im sorry if it seemed like a straw man since thats not what i intended to do smartass, 
  because you put it in that way . 
   your very first post is a vague rightwing soliloquy attacking the author with a bed of flowery prose hiding a baseless opinion you said it was `` right wing '' . 
  what do you base this allegation on ? 
  if someone has a different political orientation than you , does it make their opinions less valid ? 
  as we speak , our interior ministry prepared a `` integration program '' for returning isis fighters and their families theres a lot of things we can do to prevent this from happening here and the first would be to deny these isis fighters from getting in here to go on with their lives, 
  bosnia isnt fucking chechnya , stop assuming nato can fix everything . 
  im not against nato but youre just naive . 
  maybe learn the history of the happenings in chechnya and educate yourself also why do you assume that people of chechnya would want nato to `` fix '' their country ? 
  are you just smug ? 
   yeah , no . 
  it 's occupied . 
  its a long and complex story . 
  theres a good reason why chechnya couldnt remain independent  why would nato ever get itself into bosnia and herzegovina ? 
  because it wants stable countries . 
  chechnya will never become stable 2 . the current situation is about as good as its gon na get  no power vacuum with nato . 
  did n't you read ? 
  so nato will permanently occupy chechnya instead of russia ? 
  youre hilarious , holy shit . 
  and what happens when nato leaves ? 
  or are you going to build democracry , like in afghanistan ? 
  how did that work out ? 
   i 'm certain nato can do the same in chechnya lmao why in the fuck would nato ever get itself into chechnya . 
  theres nothing in chechnya . 
  all russia wants is that it stays stable and doesnt spawn any more jihadist groups . 
  any power vacuum in chechnya is guaranteed to destabilize it and give foothold to these groups . 
  do you have any idea how bad it was there until kadyrov managed to stabilize the situation , with the help from kremlin of course . 
  chechnya is a part of russia and nato deploying to chechnya would start an open conflict . 
  let me guess , next youre going to suggest arming islamist militants in caucasus . 
  youre definitely not the sharpest pencil in the box, 
  are you fucking kidding me chechnya is somewhat stable because of kadyrov . 
  yeah he might be a dickhead but if hes removed , there would be a power vacuum and all shit would break loose . 
  no question about that . 
  do you have any idea how this works down there ? 
   i 'm sure most people in chechnya , georgia , ukraine or moldavia would welcome a regime change in russia . 
  ehh not necessarily all of those . 
  ukraine yeah , maybe . 
  but definitely not in fucking chechnya , the region would be in chaos again with islamist groups gaining strenght and the internal feuds would get way , way worse . 
  georgia and moldavia will dislike russia anyways , it doesnt matter if theres a regime change . 
  also a regime change isnt always for the better . 
  the regime will change when it does . 
   i want a regime change in russia honestly that wouldnt be a good idea . 
  its easy for you to support that when you dont neighbor russia, 
  whats wrong with the header picture ? 
  alot of those protests had antisemitic undertones or antisemitic actors organizing them . 
  if i yell jews to the sea what does it sounds like to you ? 
   i do not believe that a person should have the capability to take someone elses life as easily as they can with a gun .

  i am sorry this is happening , i ca n't imagine what you are going through . 
  please come to europe ? 
  i came to ask the exact same thing ? 
  what is going on ? 
  how is this possible ? 
  hrrr stop it !!, 
  jesus just the mental image is so gross :d edit : aaand i accidentally deleted my comment . 
  sigh . 
  oh wow , well there we go . 
  i feel so bad for the sane people in turkey . 
   just announced that they will accept ballots without their seal and ballots that have been written stamped `` evet '' ( yes ) on them instead of the valid `` my choice '' stamp . 
  i am not the one to call rigged everytime akp wins an election but this is scandalous . 
  is this real life ? 
  it 's even worse i could ever imagine . 
  thank you i really enjoyed reading that !, 
  such a cute tradition . 
  hahah whaat ? 
  please tell us more !, 
  that would be actually really interesting , to have a thread where everyone would share their easter traditions . 
   the cream makes it delicious . 
  nothing in this world can make m\u00e4mmi delicious . 
  you could pour unicorn tears on it and it would still be horrible . 
  yup i was confused too . 
  the food was low quality , it was very poorly presented and even the hostess did n't even try to sell them :d what even was that box they offered leip\u00e4juusto from ? 
  gross . 
  hihi , well , our cuisine can be ... 
  interesting so i do n't blame him really . 
  personally i ca n't stand m\u00e4mmi , the last time i was forced to eat it out of politeness was when i was visiting my ex-boyfriends grandparents and i was honestly afraid of puking on the table . 
  it was horrible . 
  but what can you do , being dirt-poor and having a pretty infertile ground kinda produces lame food culture . 
  considering most of finnish history has been just struggling not to die from hunger it kinda did n't leave that much room to concentrate on the quality . 
  i 'm disappointed they did n't offer him salmiakki , the one true finnish delicacy i actually love . 
  foreigners tend to have very mixed reactions to it :d, 
   he 's funny even if he would n't have insulted our glorious national delicacies , i do n't find him funny at all . 
  if i ever saw him on tv i had to switch the channel because it is so stressful just to look at him . 
  but then again i do n't find people yelling , being rude and swearing funny , but i guess humour is subjective . 
   constantly travelling between the uk and us . 
  haha i love the bromance between two european powerhouses . 
  why are you so obsessed about wanting to slap children 's asses ? 
  why all these messages justifying it and making up absurd bs scenarios trying to argue against the law ? 
  what is wrong with you ? 
  yes , unfortunately . 
  people react very strongly because they probably have been smacked themselves ( and therefore ca n't handle someone criticizing their parents ) , and because it is so deeply rooted in so many cultures . 
  however , i think we should be optimistic . 
  there are so many studies clearly proving physical punishing harms children , countries are changing their legislation , it is going forward all the time . 
  for example , my mother ( who grew up outside europe with a very poor and rough childhood ) still used some methods to us and i was spanked , hit with a shoe , pulled from hair and so on . 
  i know i am not traumatized and have absolutely nothing but love to my mum , but at the same time i know i will not be doing the same to my kids . 
  every generation it gets better . 
  just think about how we have progressed in domestic violence . 
  it 's not long that we considered it perfectly reasonable for a man to punish and teach their `` difficult '' wives physically , nowadays it is perfectly obvious at least the majority of people defending the beating of kids in this comment section would absolutely never do the same when talking about domestic violence . 
  we consider that medieval and condemn those cultures that allow it , and it will be the same with children . 
  when we are capable of taking the part of a child we will accomplish never hitting kids again . 
  i am a tiny girl and men just yelling at me scare the shit out me , not to mention having to fear them putting their hands on me . 
  at the same time i am a grown adult who should have the capacity to handle those situations . 
  for me just 20-30 heavier and taller men are really intimidating , but with kids we are giants compared to them ( sorry for the shitty example , but i could n't come up with a better one right now . 
  but bottom line is , if size difference is scary to grown adults , how about little kids ? ) . 
  and they have so fragile and gentle developping minds that ca n't process things the way we do . 
  they should be loved an protected , not assaulted . 
  it 's sad we have to even talk about this . 
  hitting kids is madness and should be unacceptable . 
  it gets me so mad . 
  because it just must be a complete apocalyptic meltdown with destroyed families , hysterically crying children and proper , god-fearing people locked away for the rest of their lives in cold cellars living on nothing but bread and water , all because they made that one fatal mistake and gave a light smack on the child 's butt . 
  otherwise it just is n't a good law that is properly enforced . 
  or then there just _ must _ be a way to reason why the country allowing to beat kids is the right way , so obviously having that law is going to automatically mean vicious fascist-states that are there just to control and torture your family , eagerly waiting good , loving parents to make that one mistake so they can take your kids away for good . 
  because why would n't they . 
   parents only ever smacked me on the ass once or twice in 18 years , and if you want to label them as horrible parents people because of that & accuse me of having stolkholm syndrome , than so be it . 
  i did n't mention your parents anywhere ? 
   if these laws are properly enforced , than yes , parents will be arrested , their careers will be ruined & their kids will be shipped off somewhere because of a smack on the ass . 
  dear sir , you are clearly confused about the fact that your country 's practices does n't apply to the whole world . 
  i think it should be perfectly clear your way of ** properly enforcing ** laws is not the only one existing , since the laws are different everywhere . 
   and yes , you can point out that does n't really happen as of now , but does lack of enforcement justify a bad law ? 
  not at all . 
  a law that states that beating children is wrong but at the same time does n't completely destroy the life and family of the parent is n't a `` bad law '' , it is a reasonable law in a reasonable society . 
  of course we have social services here in finland and they intervene when there is actual abuse that the child should be protected from and when it is obvious the parent 's are n't capable of taking care of the kids , but the point of our social services is not to destroy families and lives . 
  their job , and also the job of our maternity clinics , is to ensure the well being of the child . 
  that happens by supporting , counseling and helping those parents who might have trouble parenting their kids without using force . 
  even if you were sentenced by lightly giving a spanking to your child ( an [ example ] ( http://www.iltalehti.fi/uutiset/2015042919594424_uu.shtml ) , in finnish though ) , you will have a fine . 
  most importantly , it is perfectly obvious the child protect services will intervene in this family in some way to ensure the mom never flicks her kids again , but taking the kid away ? 
  of course not . 
  it is very expensive , very painful and very traumatizing . 
  it is the absolute last option possible . 
  i understand it can be confusing from someone that comes from a country that locks up people for 50 years for robbery , but actual jail time is pretty hard to get in finland . 
  not to mention long sentences , you have to do _ really _ bad stuff to get those . 
   so i mean , if you disagree with the above scenario happening over a slap on the ass , why do you disagree with changing the law to prevent it ? 
  i seriously ca n't tell if you are trolling or not . 
  because we are actually capable of making a legislation that is meant to protect and rehabilitate people , not punish and burn their whole life down if they make one mistake ? 
  i know for a fact the absurd scenario you painted is n't what 's happening in finland , so obviously i do n't have to disagree about the law because i know it wont lead to anything like that , since there is n't anything to prevent ? 
  there can be both you know . 
  protecting the families and having law against beating kids . 
  it does n't have to be completely black and white with apocalyptic scenarios . 
  i believe he meant this map and therefore svalbard , that is the most northernmost settlement in the world . 
  that belongs to norway . 
  because for some reason people ( especially women ) are _ much _ more willing to put their hands on ( their ) children than other adults . 
  it is considered as a reasonable way to teach kids in many cultures and countries and therefore it is reasonable to singularly point it out to highlight that it is wrong . 
  oh please . 
  if you want to defend your country 's ( or your own ) practices to ensure parents can punish their children physically , at least try to stick to the remote facts instead of painting ridiculous absurd scenarios like that . 
  you know perfectly well people do n't lose their children and have their careers ruined because they smacked their kids on the butt . 
  stop playing stupid . 
  that does n't take away the fact you should n't spank your kids . 
  because punishing children physically is wrong and abuse .

  the main advantage democracy awards a state is stability . 
  everyone participates , which invests people in the system , allowing for far less need to control people on individual level . 
  discarding referendum results like this turns this into a disadvantage , as not only the pacifying effect is nullified , but it 's turned into a reason for deposing the state and its powers . 
   but no , we have to be hand tied because `` democracy '' , but god forbid there is a second referendum because that 'd be extremely antidemocratic ... 
  correct . 
  for example , what was done to get lisbon treaty in ireland was undemocratic , which is often cited as one of the main pieces of evidence to why eu decision making system has severe democratic deficit at its base . 
   nope , a working democracy would be one where people would have a real choice in election we have now established that according to your criteria , most eu powers and us are not democracies , as there 's no real political choice in those states on national level . 
  there 's just vote for one proponent of status quo , versus another proponent of status quo , that have only minimal differences in their points . 
  we have also established that leaders that win by landslides because they do differentiate themselves enough from others and enjoy massive popular support are also not democracies . 
  this fits both crisis time democratic leaders who enjoy strong mandate because of their views , i.e. 
  presidents like roosevelt . 
  i 'm actually struggling to think a democratic state in the world that would meet your arbitrary criteria for this supposed democracy you 're talking about . 
  about the only state that comes to mind is swiss-style federation , and that 's because their democracy is so cripplingly strong , that it paralyses the decision making machine and allows for more significant demagoguery . 
  yeah , i think any credibility you have on this subject in the eyes of anyone with reasonable comprehension of history is gone should they ever bother reading this far . 
  my job here is done i suppose . 
  i did . 
  and then you chose to continue with your denialism , in this very thread . 
  systemically , and all while continuing to claim that he did in fact rise democratically . 
  this demonstrated both the massive internal moral corruption you suffer from ( ideology peddled more important than truth , even on issue as important as the rise of greatest tyrant of europe to power ) , as well as complete denial of history when it does n't suit the said narrative . 
  you literally said absolutely nothing relevant to the subject there . 
  we 're not arguing about whether people are influenced or not . 
  we 're arguing that this influence is detrimental to the basic values , such as a value of secular state . 
  in both poland and russia , these values are severely threatened . 
  poland tried to push mention of christianity as the religion of europe into the core texts of eu , and in russia , church is doing similar things . 
  surely even a religious us citizen would agree that this is a bad influence on the state ? 
  is that really true for those who are influenced by religion though ? 
  there 's a reason why relevant church is so wealthy in both poland and russia . 
  there 's a large enough core populace that is willing to put their money into it , and if you 're that invested , surely you 're also going to be active in it . 
  because you did . 
  you made a false claim that he got into power democratically . 
  he had to butcher his way into power , * because he did n't * . 
  it 's my understanding that every election in poland has to do with religion , because there 's a very devoted catholic core of people who will vote in accordance with their priests ' wishes . 
  this is universally true in many places , and is often used by catholic church to secure political power among democratically elected politicians . 
  on your second point , i could most certainly be wrong . 
  however all materials i 've read on the issue of east european and specifically polish immigration suggest that those who actually do emigrate are younger people who do n't yet have families , and who do not earn enough for weekly flight to and from the country of their origin . 
  for example , older more experienced doctors who work in western europe often fly back home on weekends , whereas nurses do actually emigrate and live in the same country as they work . 
  and it 's the younger folks with specialist education that typically form the core of urban middle class . 
  if those leave , those who stay are rural folks and higher educated higher earning bracket specialists in the cities . 
  and wealth does tend to push people to vote more conservatively . 
  recent pis victory and city protests against it showed this very divide as i understood it . 
  or am i wrong ? 
  you 're projecting us issues on specific european country . 
  the issues here are very different , and based on very different cultural base . 
  conclusions you draw as a result are very far off mark . 
  there are plenty of cultural traditions to embrace , and communists did n't supress many of them . 
  you could still dress the way you did , have your own style of . 
  you do n't have to embrace the worst of them , which is a real problem with religiocity in russia and poland as far as i know . 
  in those places , priests literally indoctrinate people into specific political sphere , which is an antithesis of secularism . 
  and secular state is a basic european value . 
  what is the point of democracy ? 
  giving people a choice , and a voice . 
  your angle appears to be `` vote like i want them to vote , and if they do n't , it 's not a democracy '' . 
  which notably is how dictatorships work . 
  but to you , that 's apparently a definition of a working democracy . 
  this perfectly aligns with similar ethical monstrosity that is your take on hitler 's rise to power in this thread . 
  i 'm beginning to understand the depth of corruption of your moral character a bit better now . 
   the argument of nazis coming into power democratically is disputed it is not `` disputed '' . 
  it 's patently proven false beyond shadow of a doubt by all credible historians . 
  your revisionism is not one that even most neo-nazis take . 
  in case you ever wonder how russian propaganda can paint us europeans as `` nazist and fascist '' . 
  people like you , and your utter ignorance of relevant history is one of the main reasons . 
  and it may come as a shock to you being as ignorant of its facts as you appear to be , but yes , many of us view hitler 's reign as an emotional subject . 
  to the point where many states will put you to jail just for denying things about it . 
  i like how you pretend that you glossing nazis as `` winners of democratic elections '' is apparently not glossing over their reign at all . 
  night of long knives never happened , but it 's not denial of brutal cleansing of political opponents after failing to grab power in democratic elections . 
  nosiree . 
  frankly , your ethics are so warped , i find it hard to even comprehend how someone can be as callous as you are on this subject . 
  i never met anyone who would actively deny atrocities that nazis needed to get into power because they could n't secure said power through democratic elections on either time , and then say `` well i do n't actually deny them , i just do n't think they happened because they gained power by winning elections '' . 
   besides , democracy is totally overrated i readily agree that if you 're anti-democratic then vote outcome obviously matters little to you . 
  that said , system is indeed democratic , and just because you hate democracy you do n't get to dismiss the decisions by this system . 
  that is simply not how states work . 
  i would to hear your opinion on how this division allows 5 million minority to override 65 million , when 5 million minority was allowed to vote . 
  i would also like to know how you : 1 . 
  draw a line on where minority is big enough to be able to utterly veto majority vote by everyone . 
  do not apply the same logic to all other voting . 
  suggest that rift would `` close '' by denying democratic majority their legitimacy . 
  same largely applies in the rest of europe . 
  there will always be people that need something greater than humanity to motivate them in life . 
  in this regard , we do need religions that are relative benign , so that these people do not join death cults like fundamentalist islam . 
  i recommend listening to varoufakis . 
  i disagree with him on many points , but he most certainly discusses these subjects and his ideas related to them in great length . 
  i think you have to understand that a large portion of people who are actually interested in these subjects to the point where they feel like talking about them are in fact very entrenched in their own belief system . 
  most people are n't really interested in politics , unless they affect them in a very visible , direct way . 
  they 're indifferent . 
  churchill was completely on the money when it comes to his `` best argument against democracy '' . 
  people who genuinely want to debate the value of ideas , rather than simply try to force their own entrenched ideals on others are about as rare among those who want to talk about these things , as those who want to talk about these things are rare among mainstream populace . 
  i find much of my time when trying to discuss the actual ideas and concepts is being spent just debunking ideological nonsense that comes from opinionated and ignorant peddlers of a specific narrative . 
  it 's quite disheartening , but that 's also why complex subjects that discuss ideas , such as this particular one is far less popular on this reddit than another batch of easily digestible `` let 's condemns the evil x '' , or `` look at pretty y '' posts . 
  it 's not anyone 's fault really . 
  it 's human to be like that . 
  you invented an interesting and quite absurd narrative , but you did n't actually deliver on what was asked at all :  define this non-existent defensive policy towards non members in fact , the entire construct you built up above appears to have been specifically to avoid discussing the fact that no such thing exists , and nato officials made this very clear on many junctures throughout history . 
  i am using switzerland as an example of democratic society that does not conform to ideas which you insist to be core of a democratic society . 
  either you have to argue on the same merits that you argued russia to not be a democracy , that switzerland is also not a democracy , or you have to admit that your criteria are false . 
  good to hear . 
  here 's to hoping that poland and russia follow in your example in near future , even though i doubt it . 
  i present arguments above why your argument is incorrect . 
  but perhaps the main argument is indeed the rapidity of transmission once the critical point is reached and it becomes an epidemic . 
  let 's see now . 
  toreon drew a direct comparison between hitler and putin , based on election results . 
  his exact comparison was that they both were `` democratically elected presidents that enjoyed massive support in the country and became dictators '' .

  we have longer days than the mediterranean right now , by the way . 
  i 've got a massive country boner for the netherlands : - bikes - tons of renewable energy - euthanasia - they were the first ones to legalize gay marriage - drug laws that actually make sense - close to everywhere in europe yet far from russia - great roads and other infrastructure - they speak better english than every other country in europe . 
  including england . 
  - amsterdam with the bachelor 's three b 's : beer , bongs , and bitches - they carved their country out of the ocean , and a lot of them live below sea-level . 
  how fucking cool is that ? 
  also dat decriminalization .

  i 'd put you in the `` three-striped , nearby , good guy friend club who ranks right below us in all studies '' together with estonia . 
  consider that being honorary nordics . 
  once they 1 ) adopt a similar flag 2 ) get a nordic welfare system 3 ) start teaching a scandinavian language as compulsory i do n't see why not . 
  we were part of the kalmar union with everyone else , but otherwise you 're correct . 
  could be danish . 
  several problems there . 
  norwegian citizens do n't have to rely on begging because of generous welfare benefits . 
  the definition of poverty is very much country-dependent , and someone who is below the poverty line in norway might be well above the american one . 
  the norwegian poverty line is set at 50 % of average income or about us$ 25,000 per household in a year according to the source i used . 
  also homeless people in northern europe tend to have shelter , so it 's not like they live under some bridge somewhere in sandnes . 
  norwegian hobo is quite the oxymoron . 
  you 'd have to make a conscious lifestyle choice to live without a roof above your head . 
  i 'm from finland and the first ever time i saw a homeless non-gypsy white person was in seattle when i was visiting the us for the first time . 
  i know right ? 
  i 'm white girl jealous of her .

  newscasters in sweden have been able to speak * sk\u00e5nska * in a broadcast if that feels natural to them . 
  i do n't think someone speaking in a slight dialect would be offensive , it 's just something people here are n't used to . 
  that 's the only city where they 're not just drunk . 
  they 're crossfaded . 
  except those beggars are n't norwegians . 
  they 're roma from southeastern europe brought up here by organized crime who end up taking all the money they make in exchange for food . 
  it 's a business and that 's the route norway took in an attempt to curb it . 
  there are other reasons for it too . 
  our country was founded by swedish-speakers : our national poet , runeberg , wrote in swedish , our first president spoke it , marshall mannerheim who saved us from the soviet union spoke swedish , the swedish version of our national anthem is the original one , and , hell , we were an integral part of sweden from the beginning of time until relatively recently . 
  just like people in iceland have to study danish in order to maintain ties to the other nordics , i think we should too . 
  being able to communicate without speaking english is , in my opinion , one of two requirements to being nordic ( the other one being a cross flag ) , and we ca n't give that up . 
  too bad that 's exactly what 's happening .

  if we can do it , and even have tons of money for other social services , why do you think scotland could n't ? 
  this has been a hot yet one-sided topic in finland for a few months now , and of the bigger parties only social democrats seem to oppose it because they 're afraid that it might affect the status of worker 's unions , which it wo n't .

  10 $ / day or 300 $ / month is how much money you need to eat with at least some dignity .

  must be a different poll then as one dated a day before your articles were published put them at # 1 http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/d144b594-4703-11e5-b3b2-1672f710807b.html#axzz3kvps5vbo still curious why this article gave nearly every other party 's stance on nato apart from sd who are at a minimum the third biggest, 
  so does swedish media refuse to give the sweden democrat position on anything now or are they just pissed they are the most popular party in the country now ? 
   would england be the only ones to leave ? 
  every nordic nation would leave for sure , just check our opinion of the eu right now , we are even more eurosceptic than the brits at least when it comes to further integration, 
  poor slaves , maybe they should make a better life choice and become `` refugees '' instead / s, 
  yea that 's pretty much once a year in palestine at this stage, 
  to be honest i though he seemed more on point that many people . 
  at least he 's aware of who 's causing the war in syria anyway, 
   was n't the intention with the whole attack on syria , before isis even existed , to get the russians out of the mediterranean sea ? 
  you are most likely correct , pity the west has to wrap it in the fake `` freedom '' `` democracy '' package to sell war to the plebs and end up with another libya on our hands . 
  seems this has n't been confirmed by many outlets yet but in any case it sure would be an interesting development in syria . 
  there is no transmission , the engine in these models is only for topping up the battery 's  the new range of cars could be driven by separate electric motors powering the front and rear wheels , with a small gasoline engine to generate electricity to extend the range of the batteries . 
  i would also say the crimes of a few immigrants would be a drop in the bucket so of course the stats would look good for these areas but lets agree to disagree , kallio is gone to the hipsters now but when i lived there 5/6 years ago in the good old days of massage parlors and $ 2.50 beers i 'm pretty sure there was enough crime that the transgressions of a few foreigners would barely register on the statistics . 
  well i call bullshit on their `` reception centres increase crime '' statistic . 
  just because crime does n't go up in fashionable inner city districts that have a reception center does n't mean those people do n't hop on the metro and commit crimes is less well policed districts . 
  i find it curious why they did n't give figures for more remote centers as well . 
  so yes data can say what you want it to say if you selectively pick and chose data points, 
  i ca n't help but think that 's a good thing considering the eu is showing it could n't organize a piss up in a brewery, 
  i have all the dumps downloaded in plain text , only takes one search parameter and maybe 20 minutes to go through them all .

   and they do not preach race purity . 
  different rules for different races , it 's the definition of an apartheid society, 
  well i guess biologically speaking they choose you/me but in any case , if your parents are dirt poor uneducated people eating mud pies chances are they will teach you how to make mud pies as well instead of giving you proper nourishment/education and the means to do well in the world . 
  i was thinking of making a new account soon as i hate people following me around building res profiles as they tend to do . 
  do i have your permission or should i request you approve my new username in advance in case it hurts your feels somehow or you accidentally fear it 's a giant conspiracy ? 
  can we please kick the jews out of their `` jewish state '' then , you know , because dats racisiitt and all ? 
  well at least your post history will show you did n't go down without a fight . 
  of course being right does n't fix the mistakes of a generation but at least you might be spared the scorn, 
  how you are raised by your parents along the standards and morals they impart on your is far more than `` luck '' by the time someone born in europe knows about a country called syria chances are they have a very different and distinct value system which is n't easily changed either . 
  i 'm nationalist in that i like how our country emphasizes certain values and conveys these values through the family unit and society at large . 
  people who come here have a lot to learn and in a short space of time which is why most frankly do n't bother and live by the standards of their own third world upbringings, 
  18 countries , thats called ~ ~ civil ~ ~ national disobedience suck it ~ ~ germany ~ ~ eu, 
  all those reasons put together pretty much sum up why i do n't like the idea of nato . 
  that and i 'm pretty sure the complacency factor would kill conscription and the sense of national identity and oneness that comes with it . 
  yea being against israel 's illegal annexation and occupation of the west bank doe 's not `` anti semite '' make ... . . unless you happen to be part of the israel lobby, 
   he 's joking , right ? 
  because balancing the budget is the finance minister 's freaking job !, 
  do n't worry that mans brain is as handicapped as his legs . 
  i ca n't wait for the german economy to turn around so i can smugly remind that guy and his followers `` you are supposed to run a surplus in the good times to pay for the bad times not spend during the good times and borrow through the bad times '', 
  they broke it , they can buy it . 
   the cost may be 10 billion euros ( $ 11.6 billion ) , compared to 2 billion euros in 2014 , the die zeit newspaper has estimated . 
  now here 's the thing that pisses me off , the world is demonstratively more safe than it was any time in history . 
  the war in syria has been going on for years now and this is not even the most hot part of it . 
  but somehow only now and this year in particular these people expect me to believe there is five times more refuges needing five times more assistance than the year before . 
  it 's becasue you idiots in power are encouraging them , when will you get that through your thick heads !, 
  ok time to unite scandinavia and start raiding again . 
  all religions are abuse businesses , they get you with the guilt and then expect you to give money to them to free yourself of sin . 
  islam is probably just one of the worse offenders considering the scale of the lies they spin people ... if it 100 virgins for killing yourself or 1000 ? 
  no they are a product of their culture , a long streamlined mix of values and value systems passed from generation to generation ending with how their parents and peers rationalized explained the world around them . 
  that does n't change overnight and when they start bringing in their family 's and starting new family 's within their own cultural group then they just continue their own ( so far not very great as evidenced by the paces they come from ) culture . 
   in 85 years the world population will be pushing 11 billion . 
  the eu population will have shrunk in that time . 
  thats called being sensible in my view , wait until there is no petrochemicals and natural gas nitrogen based fertilizers and see if the rest of the world can feed itself while we have plenty . 
  and no we wont be taking in 11 billion refuges either, 
   if this man was still leading the usa instead of obama there would be no ukraine crisis a washed up actor , ahahahahahha . 
  better off putting arnie in power if you ask me, 
   in a sense it means the watering down of actual `` europeans '' into something new . 
  you only have to look at africa and the middle east to know what that means . 
  no thanks,

  oh of course the stock market was up 50 % compared to where it was in january of this year . 
  a sharp pullback is totally within the realms of normal but to say it 's a full blown crash considering how fast it rose is premature as well . 
  of course it does , locating it anywhere is the problem but the german govnerment clearly has problems listening to what the market/populace is telling them, 
   you would use app store , mac store , google play , windows store , steam or other distribution platform to distribute your software . 
  so in other words use centralized platforms that all scoop off a large share of your profits ... and they say the eu is not a trojan horse for big business, 
  trade surplus/trade defect for greece , rules on not being allowed for forgive debts and a weird overall idea that every country should be able to run a trade surplus which is pretty much impossible . 
  all in all germany is n't very consistent telling others to abide by rules that it feel it can flaunt, 
   a house of cards would mean that if china falls we all fall and thats what will happen , although it wo n't be to do with the stock market . 
  right now the chinese stock market is as much a symptom of the lagging chinese economy then anything and this has been reflected for near a year now via plummeting demand for commodity 's . 
  baltic dry index and dow transports all show business and freight is n't moving like it used to , it 's just taken a bit of time for this to work through to the real economy but in short if china sneezes the world is well placed to catch a cold . 
  becasue on one hand you countries like greece you ca n't break eu law and then you go ahead and break eu law when it suits yourselves . 
  it totally blew my mind last night how easily we can turn on each other , the experiments they go through in the documentary like when the schoolteacher decides `` from now on blue eyes people are better than brown eyed people '' translated into an actual `` us vs them '' attitude in a classroom of five year old white children in mere days and then on to how soccer fans feel instant bonds with others just becasue they wear the same shirt and how it affects their real behaviors when it comes to how willing they are to help someone on the other side . 
  it 's honestly scary but at the same time i do n't know what to take from it as it seems to be as just as easily defined part of the human condition as it could be defined racism/xenophobia . 
  the only logical conclusion is that it makes both sides more polarized in their opinions as someone who loves to understand mass psychology it 's already so evident in this sub . 
  anyway i thought it was relevant to post here as no matter what side of the immigration debate you fall on you can learn something from this and to me thats most important . 
   typical welfare moochers starts to show finns are more likely to be on welfare than native swedes or immigrants from other nations ? 
  this has to be the most stupid reflex argument i 've ever entertained . 
  although maybe you are right , we clearly do n't ' share this pc immigration at all costs culture . 
   i hope for every shelter that gets burned down the government builds a new one at the same place with more capacity taking the old chinese approach to the stock market crash there . 
  `` well this did n't work , lets just throw more good money after bad , eventually they will stop burning us . '', 
  yea there is totally a way going on in the balkans just they all forgot to tell us / s, 
   having to live under 5 years of far right rule . 
  is an immigrant free society worth trading for that ? 
  why ca n't we have both , no far right and no unnecessary extra people damaging an already weak unemployment situation in europe . 
  i 'm not right wing , i do n't look at the humanitarian left wing side either , i just see economics of extremism which means you do n't import extra labour during an unemployment crisis, 
  i think this is a must see documentary if anyone gets the chance to watch it in full . 
  it goes into what brings about genocide amongst otherwise and previously ordinary folk - turning good neighbours against each other etc ; how the unthinkable somehow becomes psychologically possible far more easily than people could ever expect ... think stanford prison experiment several case studies are used from history , including rwanda , nazi germany , and armenia , amongst others - and finds quite clear stages which are paralleled in all cased . 
  real sociological experiments are used to demonstrate the same individual aspects in modern people - things like tribalism with football team supporters , or that people tend to elect those most able to convincingly lie as leaders - all done in ways that will likely take you from skeptic to jaw-dropped . 
  possibly the most enlightening well-constructed study into an incredible aspect of the human condition i 've ever seen and in light of whats happening in europe regarding the illegal immigration it might even scare you but no matter what side of the debate you take you could sure learn something from this . 
  what i got from it is 1 . 
  tribalism is real and ca n't be made go away by telling people to be more tolerant just like you ca n't tell a claustrophobic being in a small space wont cause them any distress . 
  2 . it 's possible to turn back from the brink through more open society where everything is discussed and everyones ideas are validated or shut down early ( this is why genocide rarely happens in countries with good free speech laws 3 . 
  i have no good answer to what europe should do about the illegal immigration problem but if there is n't action the `` us vs them '' will keep heating up to the point there is a mass murder . 
  obviously i insulted the edgy teenagers on this sub and screwed up their homework assignments by saying as such though : /, 
  so if you include your average of 2.4 children we are looking over 2 million of millions of these boat people overall then ? 
  that just makes the situation worse , we should take women and children only for a while , at less they are less likely to lash out at their new adopted countries . 
  yea look at the video again and tell me how 99 % of those featured are going to be popping out babies anytime soon .

   finland never said anything hostile against ussr , nor was it allowed to join any bigger western alliances or opinions yes , that is what is called `` neutrality '' . 
  as opposed to taking sides . 
  it would n't fly because russian minorities are n't interested in joining russia in the first place . 
  they quite enjoy higher standard of living , lower corruption and frankly more westernized culture . 
  source : i talked to quite a lot of them when i was in narva in mid 2000s . 
  they were pretty miffed at blatant estonian racism , but they wanted to change it internally , not by welcoming an outside intervention . 
  or maybe most people simply saw it for what it was . 
  that once they got their president in , he was violently overthrown , even though he was basically the same as two previous ones . 
  he just was n't bending over to the western ukrainian interests like the previous ones . 
  and trampling over theirs, 
  nothing binding , which is the only thing that matters in any way . 
  that said , we have mandatory conscription for males and voluntary for females , and long tradition of reservist defence forces , to the point where we raised absolute hell about the currently negotiated weapons directive being debated in parliament . 
  it had a small chance of making reservist weapons illegal , and that was simply unacceptable to us . 
  essentially , we 're a classic `` low value , high cost target '' . 
  we made stalin balk at losses he had to take to just grab us . 
  i seriously doubt that any of the currently living generations of russians are willing nor able to absorb even a meaningful fraction of those losses in a war , just to grab a largely inconsequential country in the north with which they have the most peaceful border of any border they have anywhere . 
  russophobic , not at all . 
  just wary . 
  our russian and estonian minorities , both of which overwhelmingly share a language and culture are the best integrated non-native minorities we have . 
  though it obviously also helps that most of them are either married to a local , or are families of returnees from inkeri finns . 
  in case you want to find out more , here 's a very good episode of the war college podcast that has a long time reporter that worked in russia for several decades talk about this issue ( among many others ) from point of view of russian people that are n't muscovites ( which is pretty much entire russia for overwhelming majority of western correspondents in russia ) . 
  https://soundcloud.com/war_college/the-simple-reasons-russians let 's just say that yes , the angle you 're moaning about has been peddled widely , and yes like most propaganda we 've been peddled about russia it is completely wrong . 
  at least in part because people peddling it have n't ever left moscow to research the issue and simply do n't know any better . 
  why does every propagandised idiot think that anyone showing ability to think things other than heard in his propaganda is a `` bot for the evil that i 'm propagandised against '' ? 
  the answer is that most people are genuinely lazy , and not only do n't find out how complex things work , but do n't even want to . 
  so those who bother to do so make them feel bad about themselves , triggering the defensive reaction of trying to get them to shut up by calling them names . 
  i reiterate my earlier point . 
  how is this relevant to the point being discussed here ? 
  what you 're doing is deflecting attention from the point being discussed at best . 
  it 's worth noting that this court 's current amount decisions that were ever enforced stands at zero . 
  there was a good talk about it on geopolitics reddit . 
  then stop talking and take action . 
  vote those who would act to stop it rather than talk about it . 
  or pointedly not talk about it . 
  core tenets of islam dictate that no muslim must rest until entire world is islamic . 
  europeans are resisting . 
  therefore , they must be beaten until they submit . 
  it 's not the first time it 's resisting either , and for now , they 're less brutal then they used to be in the cordoba caliphate and ottoman empire . 
  they will most certainly never leave europe alone until either europe submits or islam as religion is dead . 
  you just compared driving people over with a truck with expressing an opinion that people who 's religious beliefs drive them to drive trucks over people should not be allowed to move into the country freely . 
  regressive left ladies and gentlemen . 
  they have lost all sense of reality , and truly live in an alternate dimension . 
  people do n't radicalize in mosques . 
  they radicalise because they can read . 
  what happens is that young people go to the mosque , and outside there are folks from islamist groups with pamphlets , that guide them to read specific parts of hadiths , sunna and quaran . 
  and when you can read ( historically a very recent development ) you can actually get a good educated opinion on contents of the texts yourself . 
  and literal reading of the texts without apostate additions to it gets you the `` radical '' version . 
  that is that every man 's duty is to wage jihad and spread islam . 
  that it 's every man 's duty to kill apostates . 
  and so on . 
  it 's the cultures and needs of society that traditionally tamed islam to not be what it actually is . 
  and as people now can read the texts themselves , they abandon these traditions as apostate in nature and embrace the islam as it exists in its holy texts . 
  as it exists in islamic state . 
  they have no such problems . 
  it 's that these states have integration issues with islam . 
  historically , that problem was commonly solved as islam integrates the country into itself . 
  problem is that `` radical '' islam is the normal , straight up reading of islam 's holy texts . 
  it 's the apostate adaptations that make it borderline tolerable in our societies . 
  that 's why these people go for more modernised muslims like the ahmadi far more so than they go for the westerners . 
  they would love you to not to play . 
  then they will take over , and play with you . 
  all it takes for evil to triumph is for good men to do nothing . 
  i know that a lot of people on the internet have short attention spans , but wow . 
  the entire post was three short paragraphs , and you did n't even make it to the third ? 
  let me quote it for you , in hopes that maybe , just maybe , you 'll read all the way to the third paragraph this time :  then again , this is a guardian article , so you know exactly what you 're going to get . 
  europhilic spin to the maximum and then some . 
  guardian is the paper that openly decried democratic process and democracy after the vote , with amazing analyses like `` why old people should n't get to vote '' and so on . 
  do a google search on it if you do n't believe me , using site : guardian.com criteria . 
  you 'll be amazed , or horrified , depending on how far you really are into regressivism . 
  i meant the syrian government and region it holds . 
  i obviously did n't talk about holdings of islamic state or similar rebellious factions . 
  your second point is utter nonsense . 
  all of those things ( with exception of planes , simply because air travel was rare back then ) have been done in indonesia . 
  which is relevant to this point because ? 
  united kingdom is an imperial state , with massive ability of force projection and willingness to use it , and large holdings far away from its own native land . 
  are you contesting this ? 
  highly unlikely . 
  in most cases , money is siphoned out of the state budget before these things are done . 
  it 's simply too traceable . 
  that 's why navalny makes a point not to claim anything of the sort in the video . 
  his entire claim is that `` they steal so much , they are going crazy from all the money and not knowing what to do with it '' . 
  thing is though , when it comes to the life of the ultra rich , everything shown is actually quite tame by the standards of private aviation . 
  i recommend you read about private aviation and just how the ultra rich that can afford to rent these private jets from the leasing companies fly . 
  it 's effectively a parallel world that has nothing to do with what you and i see at airports . 
  that is actually something that is no longer true . 
  it was true for soviet union . 
  nowadays , even putin openly talks about power of money and how it affects politics . 
  back in soviet union on the other hand , you needed political power to be wealthy , because the only way to be legally wealthy was to go through the offices of political power . 
  i was talking about the story linked above . 
  what are you talking about ? 
  different jobs require different skills . 
  `` good international reputation '' is very low on the totem pole of importance when it comes to qualifications on being a foreign minister of an imperial state . 
  if anything , it can be detrimental , as foreign interests may see him as someone who will concede more to protect his reputation . 
  to see an example , all you need to do is to look at our current foreign minister and just how awful of a reputation he has . 
  guardian has openly called him a racist and a nazi wannabe before . 
  he 's worked out just fine in his role . 
  birth of modern terrorism occurred in indonesia , where cia used militant islamism to stop communist uprising in accordance with doctrine of stopping spread of communism . 
  the brutality and death toll was staggering , and it demonstrated to world powers that islamic faith is an excellent ideological tool for attacking one 's enemies . 
  notable exception in this was ussr , as their own large muslim minority was at extreme risk of getting radicalized itself . 
  which is likely the main factor why usa worked the islamic lever as hard as it did .

  or does someone have to draw you a map ? 
   who have to keep going through your comments and deleting them . 
  so not only do you get offended for the sake of others , you also worry about how much work people can do ? 
  man you really are such a nice person ... well no i take that back , you 're not nice , you are in fact very narrow minded and completely pointless to talk to . 
  besides the rules you are referring to say this one :  racism , as well as xenophobia , homophobia and other forms of bigotry will not be tolerated . 
  are deeply worrying in a sub that is highly political as it is a subjective view on what falls under each `` category '' . 
  as we see here , what you see as racist i do n't . 
  what i see as bigotry you do n't . 
  your views to me feel very bigoted by the simple definition of the word bigoted :  bigoted having or revealing an obstinate belief in the superiority of one 's own opinions and a prejudiced intolerance of the opinions of others . 
  with bigotry not allowed you should be banned right away . 
  but i guess that does n't work for you . 
  they wonder why people are fed up . 
  huge unemployment , people loosing houses , livelihoods and you name it and these idiots spend like there is no tomorrow . 
  while some idiot cheer them on without thinking what they 've create . 
  not biased at all . 
  let us pretend there are n't massive issues with this . 
  because ... sweden . 
   one of my great hopes is that one day you 'll realize how abhorrent your positions are . 
  that , or that you 'll one day see the shame in your children 's eyes over the opinions you have . 
  now we are talking . 
  instead of whining about it just say it . 
  i mean i can take it and so can anyone else that according to you have abhorrent opinions . 
  let it all out , it is going to make you feel so much better . 
  what comes to my children . 
  well they will be allowed to form their own opinion and i will teach them one important lesson that many seem to not understand . 
  never judge a person on their opinions . 
  if you disagree take the debate . 
  if you are too afraid to take the debate , then you are not secure in your own beliefs and should with even less reason judge anyone over it . 
  they will also learn to respect freedom of speech and opinion . 
  however incomprehensible it might sound for you , i 'd be willing to die for your right to say what the hell you want . 
  i doubt that you would be willing to do the same for anyone that does n't agree with you . 
   pre-judging people based on your subjective opinion that they are not-native . 
  not native has nothing to do with race . 
  absolutely nothing . 
  racism also per definition means that you see people of another origin , race , ethnicity or whatever you may call it as worth less than you . 
  i do n't . 
  i think that every person has the right to exist , and that every person has the right to have an opinion and that everyone is as much human as i am . 
  but i do not think that europe should be open for everyone , i do not think that all people are completely and identically equal in every possible way . 
  some are smarter , some richer , some poorer , some good at sport , some are bad at sports etc. 
  i also believe that some cultures foster behaviour not compatible with western society . 
  but that is a cultural issue , not a race issue . 
  if it so happens that everyone belonging to that culture is of the same race it still does n't make it anything but a cultural issue . 
   yes , i 'm ` professionally offended ' because i try and explain to a racist , xenophobic , sociopathic , bigot that their opinion is abhorrent . 
  no you 're professionally offended by the way you are trying to go around asking for banns , or the creation of other subs to opinions that do n't suit you and your world view . 
  exactly this . 
  i mean seriously . 
  it just goes to tell what is deemed an ok opinion and not in this sub and it is about time someone took it by the legs and shook it around a little . 
   i have a problem with racists that inherently means that you have an issue with opinions . 
  furthermore your definition on what is `` racist '' is very happy-go-go . 
  shooting at a boat with immigrants is n't racist . 
  it does not make any statement on ethnicity . 
  it does not make any statement on xenophobia , it only is a statement about doing a to stop b. 
  nothing more , nothing less . 
  you , yourself make it `` racist '' . 
   you would see me as sub-human well i kind of do and it does not have anything to do with your ethnicity . 
  i 'm also fairly sure that by now you see me as a sub-human . 
  do i cry over it , no . 
  should i ? 
  it 's an opinion and nothing more . 
   given you 've said many remarks along those lines in the past if you are referring to my many comments about gypsies ? 
  well once again i 've never said it is a genetic thing . 
  i 've said that their culture seems to breed a form of behaviour . 
  culture and race are very much different things . 
  i also said that at what point do we ask if it is ours or their fault that gypsies ** seem ** to be universally hated in all countries that have a gypsy population . 
  i mean it is a valid question . 
  it is an interesting question . 
  because there is no way to deny that gypsies tend to end up not being a particularly liked minority in the countries they have a `` significant '' population of gypsies . 
  again , seems like you prefer to only discuss what you deem ethical enough to talk about . 
  any opinion that questions your world view is racist , xenophobic or pure evil . 
  opinions you deem to fall under your subjective categorisation of intolerance is an intolerant act by itself . 
  you preach tolerance but you seem to be very intolerant yourself . 
  but no worries , you 're not alone . 
  there are many `` professionally-offended-people '' out there . 
  it is nothing new . 
  well in fact it is , this whole political correctness movement is fairly new and the only way it 's followers can protect it is to kick up a huge dust cloud of being offended or throw in a hitler car or two so that they can kill off any discussion aimed at questioning this whole phenomenon . 
   he gets shouted out very much so . 
  like savannajeff and a few others that are kicking and screaming because this sub is n't the cuddly we-want-to-save-the-world-and-sing-togheter-sub anymore . 
  the amount of angry pms i get form some users here is hilarious . 
  most of the time it 's not even over a comment where i intended to push it a little to the extreme . 
   i 've been contacted by a number of former quality posters well that is quite of a subjective opinion is n't it . 
  long before i ever posted my first comment in / r/europe i was amazed what a circlejerk it was in here . 
  sure do i sometimes push the envelope , yes . 
  do i sometimes intentionally want to push it a little too far , yes and at least it is starting to feel that not each thread is the same old . 
  it is quite obvious that you want to have some pro-eu-political-correct club here . 
  but you know what , that is n't going to happen . 
  that is undemocratic and if the mods go down that road it would just go to show that this sub has nothing to do with europe but a lot to do with the `` right opinions '' . 
  can you not comprehend the fact that this `` tide you 're talking about '' also reflects the current political tide in europe . 
  the continent this sub is all about . 
  christ one more of these . 
  well let me tell you the world has gone too far with what it deems racist and or xenophobic . 
  my issue with the roma are n't really anything unique in the context of people in europe . 
  but instead of walking around whispering about it i prefer to say it out loud . 
  this at least allows for a discussion about it . 
  there are tons of stupid comments made daily that i might find offensive if i want to . 
  but i do n't . 
  i think that life is too short to be that thin skinned and be offended , in some case for the sake of others . 
   then there are the people that even outright suggest gunning down refugee children to prevent more refugees coming . 
  ah ... my famous comment . 
  well you see what i said is that it is a solution . 
  and it sure is .

  and i 'm not counting vague cases or when someone just mentions it , as mocking . 
  there 's only few things that i hate more than foreigners who throws around the word `` finlandization '' in a mocking way , without understanding the realities that small countries living next to a big and dangerous country have to deal with . 
  it 's easy to mock when you do n't have to live with it . 
  a good article . 
  you 'll be glad to know then that she shows * a lot * more . 
  and the hardcore shots on the album . 
  always have to read these two times . 
  first ltr and then rtl . 
  why do i never learn . 
  oh you catholic prudes . 
  we really should . 
  but as long as many eu countries are in the nato , there 's countries that see now need for one . 
  so if nato does n't suddenly cease to exist , i do n't think we 'll get anywhere . 
  but i 'm glad to say that finland has been pressing the idea of eu forces . 
  wow . 
  had to google those to check they 're real . 
  those are damn hilarious !, 
  imagine being stuck with a `` nickname '' like `` spindleshanks '' for all eternity . 
  because it was such a huge deal , i even watched the news just as it broke . 
  i thought i would remember something like this , especially when i remember lesser incidents that have happened is western europe or the us . 
  it 's not i feel compelled to remember this particular thing per se , but that i forgot this and remembered lesser ( in comparison ) `` incidents '' , maybe because they happened in we or the us . 
  so i feel bad for forgetting about this , partly because i do n't know why i did n't remember it . 
  `` the elbow-high '' ? 
  * really * ? 
  that 's funny and interesting . 
  i 'm ashamed to admit this , but i did n't remember this thing at all before being reminded about it . 
  i remember watching the broadcast about this and all ... 
  i do n't know what it says about me . 
  it might actually be because of my prejudice against russians , which is a horrible thought . 
  i hope that is n't it . 
  because it got traction . 
  once a post gets that little bit of visibility , it can get to front page really fast . 
  being tolerant towards ignorants is really hard . 
  i do n't think he was questioning the facts , but the motivation of the op behind posting this . 
  i hope you are , i fear you are n't . 
  though saying that `` i hope you are the last ones russia invades '' seems way colder than i wanted it to be . 
  and my axe . 
  no , seriously . 
  he can have one of my axes if it helps . 
  i have like three . 
  but he ca n't have my favorite one , he can choose between the two others . 
  i seriously doubt he 'll even go for eu countries . 
  you get the image that they 're fighting everything that has to do with added integration of the union . 
  which is a bad thing imo . 
  it really feels like they do n't want to be a part of the union and are fighting everything the eu is trying to do . 
  makes no sense to have them as an uncommitted and almost hostile member . 
  are you saying that warsaw pact is a good example that military alliances that proclaim to be defensive do n't attack or pose a threat to their neighbors ? 
  because my point was that nato is to russians what warsaw pact was to the west during cold war : a scary and threatening military alliance . 
  well , so did warsaw pact . 
  they never actually attacked nato or the west . 
  but for obvious reasons , the west still feared that that might happen . 
  the whole point of nato was to act as a counter to soviet block and the ussr , which russia is a successor of . 
  and the warsaw pact was the main adversary of nato . 
  does n't take a genius to figure out why russians would see it as an anti-russia military alliance , and even hostile to them . 
  which is a fair opinion for them to have . 
  should the west not have seem warsaw pact as a hostile organization because it was a defensive alliance ? 
  it honestly feels like the period of relative calm is ending . 
  and even though sino-australian relations are pretty good , as a `` deputy of the us '' they 're in a tricky position , even though the current defence minister said that they want to balance between the two , instead of choosing one over the another . 
  did n't know you guys had a national guard . 
  pretty cool . 
  our national guard was disbanded as a fascist organization at the end of the ww2 . 
  ( which was n't a completely baseless claim though . 
  somewhat unreasonable , but not baseless . ), 
  yeah , they usually have ... 
  at this point , i honestly want them out . 
  they 're causing so much trouble for the rest of the eu that it 's not worth it . 
  maybe they could be happier as an us state . 
  we ca n't have both sweden and denmark in . 
  that 's just common sense . 
  i very much agree with you , my swedish brother . 
  people opposing joining nato in both countries have to work together to prevent our politicians from dragging us into nato against the majority 's will . 
  if one country decides to join , it 's very likely the other one will too . 
  and the excuse will be that `` we have to do this '' . 
  i simply do n't believe how you ca n't figure out why they would feel threatened . 
  you must live in some sort of denial you honestly believe what you said . 
  i mean , you do n't think being surrounded by a military alliance that was hostile to you for a very long time ( and is again ) and them bringing their materiel to your borders does n't seem threatening to you ? 
  saying that `` you have nothing to worry , these tanks are just for * defence * '' and expecting russians to not worry after hearing that is something else . 
  yeah , it 's a defensive pact that would bring nato forces to russia 's borders . 
  you think they see it as anything else than a hostile action towards them ? 
  and it 's easy to say that we 're just licking russia 's boots and all that stupid shit when you are n't their neighbour . 
  we have a huge border with russia and a big part of our economy is linked with them . 
  there 's nothing shameful about admitting the realities and living with them . 
  if none of them did , there probably would be no need for nato , because we would have our own defence union . 
  but alas , now some are members and that puts pressure on all to join . 
  fortunately , if you ask me . 
  unless something really dramatic happens , there 's no need to use that option . 
  estonian friend asked me a short time ago that `` are n't you scared because of ukraine ? '', 
  first i laughed because i did n't understand that he could be seriously asking that . 
  then i explained that finland is nothing like ukraine . 
  all the things that made these current troubles possible are absent from here . 
  finland has a strong standing army and stability within our borders . 
  we are a member of the eu . 
  we have been a calm , diplomatic , trustworthy and friendly neighbour . 
  as of now , there 's nothing to fear for us and absolutely no pressing need to join the nato . 
  and there most likely wo n't be in the near future if we keep our good current policy . 
  if something is going to drag us into nato , it 's sweden joining . 
  which is just fucking great . 
  people like me who are opposing the membership are watching in horror how sweden is dismantling all their defence capability and practically forcing themselves to join . 
  it has been an option for a long time . 
  we have n't used it yet and i really hope we wo n't .

  that is with regard to count one . 
   the court : all right . 
  the defendant : count two . 
  between april of 2004 and may 2011 , i and others who were fiduciaries to both fifa and concacaf , in contravention of our duties , i and others , while acting in our official capacities , agreed to participate in a scheme to defraud fifa and concacaf of the right to honest services by taking undisclosed bribes . 
  i and others agreed to use e-mail , telephone , and a wire transfer into and out of the united states in furtherance of the scheme . 
  funds procured through these improper payments passed through jfk airport in the form of a check . 
  that is regarding count two . 
  some parts of the record are still redacted probably because publishing them might hamper the ongoing investigations . 
  edit : among others this one part is of note i think : * `` i and others , while acting in our official capacities , agreed to participate in a scheme to defraud fifa and concacaf of the right to honest services by taking undisclosed bribes '' * here the defendand describes the organisations as victims of his and his co-conspirators ' corrupt conduct . 
  and , i have to say , in some sense he is technically correct . 
  yet the reason why many see fifa as the problem and not as the victim is them not pursuing impartial investigation and legal charges against the corruption but instead wiping it under the carpet and condoning it . 
  as i see it in some sense fifa may be a victim , or at least the non-corrupt part of it , but by hiding and also condoning the corruption within its organisation fifa is also a perpetrator . 
   curiously , investigations are not engaged on designation for 1994 's world cup in united states . 
  the news is about chuck blazer 's guilty plead which was sealed until yesterday . 
  in his plead he admits among others : * `` i agreed with other persons in or around 1992 to facilitate the acceptance of a bribe in conjunction with the selection of the host nation for the 1998 world cup . 
  '' * [ reportedly from the losing bid by morocco ] * `` beginning in or about 1993 and continuing through the early 2000s , i and others agreed to accept bribes and kickbacks in conjunction with the broadcast and other rights to the 1996 , 1998 , 2000 , 2002 , and 2003 gold cups . 
  beginning in or around 2004 and continuing through 2011 , i and others on the fifa executive committee agreed to accept bribes in conjunction with the selection of south africa as the host nation for the 2010 world cup . 
  '' * and that is reported by the posted news . 
  blazer started working at concacaf and fifa only in 1990 , and probably had nothing to do with earlier world cup bids . 
  i do n't see what is curious about that . 
  [ bitcoin banned in russia ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/02/09/us-russia-bitcoin-idusbrea1806620140209 ), 
  i do n't think the numerous american wildcatters are working in an concerted effort to bring oil prices down . 
  it 's just a side-effect of their fracking activities and high production rates . 
  albeit the fifa hq was raided by swiss authorities .

  if i were qatar right now i would n't be feeling comfortable . '', 
   decline in increase rate show there is a trend , that is the trend of * change * in inflation . 
  and even that is flimsy as you only have two data points for that claim , please do read you favourite quote carefully : `` yet , monthly inflation slowed for the second straight month to its lowest since october last year ''  current prediction show that inflation will fall . 
  the current prediction by russian authorities claims so . 
  that is a prediction , not a trend . 
  seems you 're confusing them a lot through your comments as if a prediction had established a trend ( it can not ) . 
  pray tell me : what exactly is wrong with the idea of observing for some more months and looking at the multiple data points then to actually establish a trend ? 
  why the hell is it so important to you to look like an idiot doubling down on stupid ? 
  if you actually were a `` a financial/commodity trader '' either something has seriously gone wrong in your education or you 're not one - or at least not a successful one at that profession . 
   lets be honest you never wrote a single intelligent point . 
  aaand that tells a lot more about your idea of being honest . 
   did you bother to read the graph at least and the page ? 
  yeah , i did . 
  apparently you somehow believe it proves your method of using one month data point as a trend . 
  it does n't . 
  come back after several months and then show if there is a trend . 
  before that : one month does not a trend make . 
   to request from the belgian government and cdh party to cancel the exclusion of \u00d6zdemir . 
  that is not for the government to interfere in the first place . 
  surely the decision of who is accepted as a member of a political party is for the party to decide , not the government . 
  influx of unskilled is not a solution for lack of skilled workers . 
  and apparently into prosecuting that . 
  yet it seems it is * you * who just can not get over the fact that you do n't know what you 're talking about and doubling down on stupid . 
  whatever . 
  go on with your merry ways as `` a financial/commodity trader '' . 
   but it has no . 
   short term mean it can be in relation to ( t-1 ) one month , three months before ( t-3 ) or the same quarter of the previous year ( t-4 ) idiot . 
   you are mentally challenged . 
  wow . 
  just wow . 
  especially from a guy who is completely unable to grasp the elementary concept of * trend * . 
   so yeah , you seriously think that i am a layman this is hllilarious . 
  no , at this point of discussion with you insisting on being ignorant of even the most basic things i do n't think you 're even a layman . 
  an actual layman would learn . 
  i think you 're just a dishonest person doubling down on dishonesty . 
   when i look an inflation graph like what he put and i see the inflation constantly rising since 8 month by an average of 1,5 % . 
  now * there 's * enough data to establish a * trend * . 
  an upward trend . 
   and that suddenly it fall after this constant rise . 
  yet a one month does not a trend make . 
  if you actually combined that one month with the other data points you just mentioned the trend would still be rising . 
   1 ) whatever the currency it has suddenly stabilize which mean it show a likely trend ah , now it 's `` a likely trend '' . 
  we 're slowly making progress , i see . 
  very , * very * slowly . 
   thus i can easily worte that it is on a downward trend . 
  you can easily write * anything * . 
  the easiness of it does n't make it correct though . 
   are you seriouslybmentally challenge ... no , one data point is not a * trend * . 
  come back when you have a graph with several months of decline and then say the graph has a declining trend . 
   again what are you blabing ??? 
  inform me on what exactly , who are you ? 
  informing you on a very very simple concept . 
  listen , you simply can not be that dense not to get it . 
   i see a decline and its a trend it is a decline . 
  of one month . 
  you can not establish a * trend * based on that . 
  yeah , well it was really pointless the last time too . 
  that did not prevent it though . 
   they wo n't find who did it unless the missile had a large flag on it that did n't get destroyed i hope you 're just joking as * that * is a exceedingly naive way to look at it . 
  by that logic a criminal is only implicated when their card has been found on the crime scene . 
  there 's many many many more ways to gather incriminating evidence than that . 
   and after that never threatened finland . 
  except that the su threatened finland with `` military consultations '' numerous times during the cold war , and the last time they did that was in the '80s . 
  furthermore , they did that even as finland had a far-reaching [ agreement of friendship , cooperation , and mutual assistance ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/finno-soviet_treaty_of_1948 ) with the su . 
   i do n't see any reason for russia to do something different . 
  yeah , well that is exactly the reason to be cautious . 
  yes , i am aware , thank you . 
   what the fuck are you talking about ? 
  hmm ... let 's see .

  usa has been a very important , possibly the most important innovator during those time periods , but not single-handedly-invented-everything important . 
  we do n't need a ` heroes of europe '' because virtually all heroes are european anyway ( / s ), 
  this comic is heretical . 
  circle-tool ? 
  you disgust me . 
  ah , well , it is hard to radicalise muslims when there are no muslims around in the first place . 
  no country is safe . 
  isis is n't fighting in self-defense . 
  they have repeatedly explained that they hate everyone who does not believe what they believe and will kill them for being infidels . 
  this is why they also kill so many muslims : because those muslims believe in islam in ` the wrong way ' . 
  it seems you are indeed [ correct ] ( https://www.loc.gov/law/help/apostasy/#pakistan ) at least according to a quick search i made . 
  however , as described in the link , blasphemy can carry the death penalty in pakistan and becoming an apostate is not very far from blasphemy . 
  very few christians believe that the old testament with all its god-approved genocide is how we should live our lives . 
  the old testament 's commands are mostly ignored , except for the 10 commandments . 
  not so for the koran , which is canonically an all-or-nothing deal to such an extent that the koran is to the letter the literal word of god , that god has a copy of it in heaven , and no koran that is not in arabic can be a true koran . 
  if you look at [ laws in muslim-majority countries ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/82/apostasy_laws_in_2013.svg ) , you can see that it is not a small minority of muslims who believe death penalty for apostasy . 
  i have talked about this with muslims online and looked at discussions they have had with others , and the consensus seems to be that indeed apostasy should be punishable by death , but try to squirm away form it by claiming that apostasy really means treason against islamic communities ( treason being vaguely defined , and i suspect would include anyone expressing their atheism in a way that might encourage others ) , or that `` death penalty for apostasy applies in only majority-muslim countries '' as if that made it okay . 
  regardless , most people are decent in general , and therefore muslims too are decent people in general . 
  it is just that they are decent despite their faith , not because of it . 
  in western countries , `` christian '' has become such a diluted concept that it only means that you vaguely think that jesus christ has saved you from sin . 
  you have to specify `` fundamentalist christian '' or a very specific sect of chrisitianity to even begin to try to find a unifying ideology . 
  and generally that ideology does not include particularly bad things , except for maybe creationism and controversial things like being anti-abortion . 
  you are right in that `` muslim '' and `` islam '' are too broad terms , and we should specify them more closely . 
  but the average muslim is closer in their belief to a fundamentalist christian than they are to an average western christian . 
  all muslims except for a small minority share the belief that the koran is the literal , perfect , eternal , unchangeable and final word of god . 
  and the koran says , for example , that apostasy must be punished by death . 
  muslims differ , but they also have a lot in common in terms of ideology . 
  if you do n't know the abbreviations , it can be hard to know which is which . 
  d for germany , e for spain etc. 
  executivemonkey is parody/satire . 
  i wo n't buy american , but that is mostly because being a student , i do n't really have much money to spend on anything but necessities which are mostly finnish . 
  on the other hand , i do use american products that are `` free '' , like reddit and facebook . 
  to be clear , i meant that trump makes us feel like it is true , not that it actually is . 
  obama was charismatic . 
  it was easy to forget what americans are actually like and what their government does when he was in power . 
  and for what it is worth , i do believe that obama geniunely did what he thought to be in the best interests of usa and to some extent the world as a whole . 
  but trump is a constant , daily reminder of what a ( near ) majority of american voters are like , and what their govenrment is like . 
  every day , he reminds us of all the ugly stereotypes we have of americans and their government , and every day he tells us that those stereotypes are 100 % true . 
  he will probably get re-elected quite comfortably . 
  as far as i know , he is rather popular , with generally moderate political views , and no one has had anything bad to say about him . 
  the president does not have as much power as they used to have , which means that the president generally is n't at the center of controversial policy , at least in the eyes of the media and the people , but instead acts more as a diplomat and a ceremonial head of state . 
  if i remember correctly , the president 's strongest domestic power is the ability to veto any law for 3 months , after which the law must go to a vote again in the parliament , but can then potentially be passed again and then be passed regardless of the veto . 
  ah , sargon `` muh german cars '' of akkad , commenting on the eu about which he knows * so much . 
  the commission ought to quietly accept that they have already lost this fight . 
  the migrants do n't want to go to anywhere except western europe , particularly germany . 
  eastern europe does n't want them and they do n't want eastern europe , and if forced to move there , they will return to western europe overnight , meaning either that the scheme is an utter failure , or that schengen needs to be abolished in which case the eu is a failure . 
  it makes no sense to provoke needless conflict within the eu . 
  focus on getting friendly relations with certain governments in mena so the migrants can be legally returned there . 
  i am sure the price of integrating migrants is far higher than paying a country to take them back . 
  less educated than migrants from mena ? 
  i am not particularly nationalist or anti-nationalist . 
  i am anti-immgration when it comes to immigration that may not in the short and especially the long run be in the interests of my country . 
  the large majority of migrants coming to europe from mena are never going to be a net benefit the host countries , due to them being poor and unskilled , and often lacking in language skills . 
  many are barely even literate . 
  demand for low-skilled labour is going to go continue to go down , and there will be no jobs for them . 
  in addition , they bring backwards cultural practices with them , combined with fundamentalist islamism . 
  shut down the migration , find a solution to the refugees that does not involve taking them as an uncontrolled unknown mass and doing a botched attempt integrating them , and i will gladly be pro-eu . 
  immigration is the only card that the far right parties have to play , and the only reason i would ever even consider voting for them . 
  take that card away , and they will collapse overnight . 
  the rest of the euroskeptics will slow down the european project , in some cases very justifiedly , but they wo n't take the eu down . 
  i wonder how well a pro-eu nationalist party would do , although that may be bit of an oxymoron . 
   coldest april and may to date , need more proof a single point of data from one place does not dataset make . 
  you need to look at the climate globally and with a timeline of at least 20 to 30 years . 
  there , you can see that 2016 was the warmest year since the records began , and possibly the warmest in thousands , tens or hundreds thousands , of years . 
  2017 has been less warm than 2016 , which is n't necessarily surprising given that 2016 was an extreme el nino year . 
  probably a joke about all the people who say they love europe , but hate the eu . 
  juncker is a funny man with lots of his own antics . 
  this is precisely why he should n't be the president of the commision . 
  the president does n't have to be a cold heartless bureaucrat , but they do have to be serious and not make jokes that are easily misinterpreted and used to fuel anti-eu sentiment . 
  i do n't think it is very likely that northern ireland will leave the uk join the rest of ireland , although brexit has raised the chances of that . 
  however , it is a real possibility , and therefore the eu should be prepared for the possibility of an united ireland happening and have legal agreements etc. 
  already in place for it . 
  why would europeans express solidarity with conservative , patriarchial islamic beliefs ? 
  a possible solution : ban all foreign funding for mosques . 
  have the state approve of all imams , and give special funding to imams who preach tolerant , peaceful , and in general pro-western values . 
  how should the west fight against islamists ? 
  sure , turning against muslims will lead more towards black vs. white views , but letting them be has also lead to extremism being preached in mosques , and into the creation of `` parallel societies '' where people live as if they were in a completely different country . 
  what you 're saying seems to imply that there is no way to win . 
  if muslims are not embraced , it plays into islamists ' hands by polarising relations with muslims . 
  but if they are not embraced so strongly that they get extremely well integrated and assimilated ( an almost impossible or at least extremely expensive feat given the number of immigrants and their level of education etc. ), 
  they will also get radicalised , along with other problems . 
  at this point , i do n't see why one would blame someone for saying , `` fine , let all muslims think us as enemies . 
  i do n't see how it affects us as long as we just close our borders to more of them and try to assimilate ( which will probably happen eventually given the flow of newcomers stopping ) or deport the ones we have . '', 
  it is perhaps simplistic , but i can see where the sentiment is coming from . 
  i think it is a fair question to ask , what can muslim immigrants provide us , that other immigrants without a potentially problematic religion ca n't ? 
  i see . 
  but unlike medical supplies , this has far less to do with economics , yes ? 
  does it cost uk something to share the findings of their intelligence with eu countries ? 
  they are not entirely comparable . 
  medical supplies are physical things subject to various regulations . 
  sharing intelligence is far easier ( eg . 
  sending something over the internet ) and not subject to any regulations that for example a trade agreement would include . 
  what i really think is happening is the world economy recovering in an unexpected way . 
  uk is doing better than expected because everyone is doing better than expected . 
  eu appears to be finally reaching proper recovery and is growing again . 
  even usa has , if i remember correctly , been seeing their economy improving despite some of trump 's counterproductive measures . 
  honestly , i do n't really like any of the candidates . 
  le pen is a russian puppet / useful idiot who would drive france and the eu to ruin by forcing through a french exit from the eu . 
  melenchon does n't understand economics and would crash france 's economy , and is also anti-eu . 
  macron seems like the best choice , and he would probably make a decent president , but he seems like yet another neoliberalist whose policies are going to continue to make the rich richer and the poor poorer , until the people turn to the extreme right or left .

  all propaganda and the best propaganda is based on truths but twisted to suit an agenda . 
  saying something is straight up propaganda is not a good enough answer for me , by your standard that photo of the dead kid on the beach was straight up propaganda . 
  i have no agenda here but a real interest in how propaganda works so i 'm curious do you ? 
  and if so why do you difference between the two ? 
  europe has had record high unemployment for years now elites answer to this , `` lets just take in record numbers of cheap labour , nobody will mind at all and i 'm totally sure it wo n't drive down the value of labour in the slightest '' / s, 
  ah the good old western respect of sovereignty right there . 
  in that case i hope the russian do n't forget their s-400, 
  that is a good question , right now it seems to be a game of passing the baton of monetary expansion between states . 
  well i suppose one of the first steps to becoming a reserve currency is full convertibility which the chinese have been working on via trading desks in most major financial districts around the world now . 
  if i anticipate the us is going to launch qe4 at some point in 2016 and backtrack on the rate hike because of the ailing stock market it 's quite easy for me to get out of dollars . 
  the yaun is not at that stage just yet but i think it will get there . 
  from an outside perspective i see the us getting too protective over their currency , up until now if i wanted to send dollars to or trade with iran my bank was obliged to stop me because of sanctions , putting those sorts of restrictions on a currency is not good for it 's long term help and in a way an abuse of control . 
  yes you are right , the dollar is the reserve and it wont change overnight but structures are being put in place by many country 's since 2008 and how in their eyes the usa bailed out it 's banks by devaluing the dollar over and over to the detriment of their reserves . 
  put simply if the us can not escape the expansionary monetary policy they have been engaged in the trend away from the dollar will exasperate, 
  yea well when it comes to dealing with muslim terrorists russians are the right people for the job . 
   four soviet diplomats were kidnapped in september 1985 by a fundamentalist group called the islamic liberation organization . 
  russia quickly dispatched its alpha group , tasked with counter-terrorism hostage-rescue operations , to beirut . 
  once the team learned that arkady katkov , a consular attach\u00e9 and one of the four hostages , was killed , ** they responded quickly by tracking down and locating one of the kidnappers ' leaders ( or relative it 's not clear ) . 
  in order to send a clear message to the terrorists , alpha group members castrated the hostage , cut him down into pieces and sent him to the hostage takers . 
  ** they also threatened to kill more of the kidnappers ' relatives if the soviet diplomats were not free . 
   as a result , the 3 hostages were released and dropped off near the soviet embassy and no russian officials were ever taken captive since then . 
  some say that the release of the soviet hostages was the result of extensive diplomatic negotiations with the spiritual leader of hezbollah , grand ayatollah mohammad hussein fadlallah . 
   newspapers quoted `` observers in jerusalem '' as saying : `` this is the way the soviets operate . 
  they do things -- they do n't talk . 
  and this is the language hezbollah understands . '', 
  that 's some game of thrones shit right there, 
   you see ... the percent of literacy is indeed important , but more important is the fact that almost none of the coming immigrants speaks german . 
  somehow everybody forgets this fact . 
  add to that the fact it 's very hard to learn a new language as an adult if you are not at least bilingual already . 
  pretty sure it 's must be next to impossible to learn how to read and write in a totally different language when you have never even picked up a book before . 
   chop its value by 75 % . 
  it would send economic shockwaves through any nation that was using the currency devastating the value of their reserves . 
  yea they devalued it by 2 % not 75 % and in case you are not aware qe had a much bigger impact on the value of the dollar that china 's two percent devaluation, 
  if i was snowden i 'd be thinking of my public image and keeping the hot russian chicks on the down low ... just saying, 
  `` hi i 'm * not * that guy who left to join isis , i do n't have any documents thanks to war . 
  can i please come stay in your country '', 
  young healthy * illiterate * refugees ? 
  because according to unesco and syrian sources it 's between ten and thirty percent . 
  http://i.imgur.com/gotsvua.png seriously if the german government was to pay me the money they pay to support refugees i could hire a nanny and pop out three or four . 
  do n't forget mongolian finns and black irish . 
  i wonder did they search all their stock photos for `` smug putin '' when picking an image for that article, 
  i agree not everything is 3x more , milk is like 1l store brand milk is 75 cents here vs i think 55 or 65 in estonia . 
  that 's said services and anything fun here is still really expensive, 
  3x higher ? 
  because beer is 3x cheaper in estonia . 
  quality of life is a bigger pull factor for me over wages and since i work in the tech industry there is a lot of startups in estonia, 
  let me guess the mods will remove this again . 
  ~ ~ jewish ~ ~ muslim ghettos rinse and repeat ? 
  when am i going to get my ttip crisis already !, 
  you 're correct but if you want to be a doctor why not . 
   if you are a software developer then it would be a good idea way ahead of you buddy , http://www.cv.ee/toopakkumised/infotehnoloogia/inglise id imagine salary is a bit lower but it 's what you can do with it that matters and it 's way too expensive here now , the idea of maybe having food with friends someone on a saturday , drinks in a bar , club and taxi home you are talking like $ 100 and if you want to live in the center of helsinki it 's like $ 600 for a 12.5 meter hole in the wall . 
  & gt ; tfw rt tells the truth and european media pushes propaganda, 
  put down the kossu , you clearly have n't seen what the average salary buys you in finland in a while then . 
  and unlike here their economy is n't in a tailspin . 
   are there some pride issues ? 
  not that i 'm aware of , the general idea is that estonians come here to work rather than the other way around though , a friend of mine is studying to be a doctor in estonia now but apart form that i do n't know anyone there . 
   http://www.cv.ee/toopakkumised/infotehnoloogia/inglise holy shit , i 'm applying for some of these , pity most they do n't give wage examples but no pride issues here thats for sure, 
   there are about 7000 finns living and working in estonia a friend of mine is actually studying to be a doctor in estonia , says it 's awesome, 
  thank you , i 'm actually thinking it could be worth it to move there , developer pay seems even better than here when you take into account cost of living . 
  i 'm seriously getting more and more tempted to move to estonia . 
  that would be super sweet , i could literally live better and make money bootlegging alcohol to finland once a month . 
  what would you recommend as a web portal to search for jobs there ? 
  that 's like the second time today auto correct has made me into an idiot !, 
  oh look it 's one of the koch brothers, 
  do n't like the way they refer to anarchist as `` libertarian '' but seems i fall right where i thought as a left leaning person who does n't like state intervention . 
  economic left/right : -6.5 social libertarian/authoritarian : -3.23 http://i.imgur.com/ilqk6qw.png, 
  yes people like that truly are running the show . 
  i 'm not sure what annoys me more the hubris or the fact these are the same people who no doubt want immigration but will never live around it . 
  this wont take long . 
  ok lets just say it costs 20k per year to house and feed one refugee ( i know it costs more but lets just use the easy example ) if the government redirected that subsidy to me i can hire a full time nanny as well as feed and clothe multiple children and yes people would be much more interested in having kids if they did n't need to give up their social lives . 
  you put in gun cotton after the powder to make the seal . 
  even modern day shotgun cartridges work on the same principle as otherwise the blast would escape around the pellets, 
  did n't you have to put that cotton stuff in after the gunpowder and behind the ball so the pressure from the black power does n't escape technically it could have worked just fine, 
  yea i suppose that does make sense, 
  so much for saving that surplus during the good times . 
  i 'll laugh my ass off if germany becomes the next greece because they failed to prepare for any downturn and now they have 1 million plus refugees on welfare to pay for . 
  thats awesome , i 'm definitely going to consider it, 
  yep thats the thing i can imagine you could do more with your spare money , just going to the cinema here and having popcorn is $ 20 . 
  beer anywhere that 's not a total dive bar is $ 5 minimum etc, 
  yea maybe i 'll take a short trip there , never been to romania but would love to go , i 'm a healthy mid 20 's guy so to be honest i have n't much need for nordic healthcare or welfare at this stage in my life and i 'd prefer messy and fun to clean and clinical life here for a while . 
  hmm , i actually would consider it but unless english can be a working language i 'm not sure i could learn romanian knowing i 'm probably not in it for the long haul . 
  but seriously , i earn about 2.5 k as a front end css/html/jscript guy who dabbles in a bit of php/asp , cms customization and that sort of thing . 
  after tax and insurances i take home just under 2k and after i pay my rent and bills i 'm left with something like $ 900 / $ 1000 in a country where a night out with food followed by drinks and club then a taxi home will run to about $ 100 . 
  put simply developer jobs here put you firmly in the average joe class, 
  i agree fully but at the same time here we are . 
  but approved by the un resolution, 
   and naturally they are much more wary about immigration than the people in west germany . 
  is that really the case or could it be more like , more people in west germany come from a mixed race background and are therefore less likely to oppose immigration, 
   average web dev  1500e/month in a country where the average is 400/month eh , sign me up ? 
  we pretty much have a glut of techies out of jobs here with the economy/nokia and other shit . 
  goddamn you auto-correct , * shakes fist *, 
   you know , europe is n't a non-existent actor . 
  you could suggest that your own country does something also . 
  yea we could but you 're the ones who promised to protect the saudis and in return they trade their oil in dollars so ... . . 
  cough , cough , ukraine . 
  i 've been called all sorts of things here for pointing out there is bias in western media but hey if it takes this situation to finally make it sink in i 'm just happy for it, 
  i 'm your linkbot but only because i fully agree and find all adam curtis amazing https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcy8uljrhpm, 
  putin also swings to the right it seems , i wonder will that be the next article, 
   christianity borrowed most of these celebrations . 
  we 're just borrowing them back .

  the argument from sovereignity is , in my opinion , just a smokescreen to avoid being labeled a bigot for opposition to immigration from poor countries and opposition to , for example , islam . 
  ( to be clear , i think there are perfectly valid and non-bigoted reasons to be against immigration and islam especially . ), 
  this can be solved by introducing a stronger border protection . 
  create offshore camps , where actual refugees can be screened and seperated from economic migrants , and possibly moved onwards to another camp somewhere else , or into europe . 
  limit immigration from poor countries . 
  the problem with demographic shift and low birth rates surely can be solved with strong enough incentives and campaigns , for far cheaper than integrating immigrants . 
  they 'll just blame it on obama or muslims or even jews or some other `` traitor of the people '' , like nazis did . 
  uk must not ( and i think will not ) be deliberately punished , but they must not retain the benefits of the eu unless they contribute to the eu and follow its rules . 
  providing the benefits of the eu for free would be the end of the eu , because why would anyone stay if they can get the benefits without being a member ? 
  time for the eu to make it easier to sue companies in other eu countries . 
  even if the vote passes , the referendum likely will be a `` no '' . 
  iceland already has a fairly good deal through the eea . 
  becoming a full member of the eu would just put them in a likely worse situation when it comes to fisheries , and bring them little benefit . 
  [ vox article ] ( http://www.vox.com/2016/4/27/11510118/spanking-children ) , and the [ study ] ( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/27055181/ ) the article is based on . 
  multiple studies over several decades say the same thing : spanking has minimal benefits and massive risks of causing antisocial behaviour , violence , trauma etc. 
  `` but i was spanked and turned out fine '' . 
  you were lucky . 
  and i was not spanked and turned out just fine too , without the risks . 
  [ here 's one meta-analyis on the subject . 
  ] ( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/27055181/ ), 
  iceland is already an eea member with free movement . 
  as luxembourg pm , his main priority was to do what is best for luxembourg . 
  and it is likely that blocking certain taxes was in the best interest of luxembourg so that it could retain its tax heaven status . 
  as a non-luxembourger , i of course do not approve him of doing this when he was pm . 
  but i understand why he did it . 
  returning migrants ( in this context , people who have illegally entered the country without being refugees or having a valid claim for asylum ) to their countries of origin and using sanctions to force those countries to accept them is now a naive far-right fantasy ? 
  no wonder the immigration systems are so screwed up , when this sort of common sense things are seen as far-right . 
   eu wide sanctions would pretty much destroy this country while removing cheap goods from europe 's market . 
  precisely . 
  the moment sanctions are legitimately and seriously on the table , you will find that suddenly taking back migrants is n't that problematic after all for the countries under the threat of sanctions . 
  when did the eu ever truly utilise its soft power ? 
  it is time to try it out on something visible and directly beneficial to the citizens of the member states . 
  do you know a good resource where i could read more about this ? 
  it seems to me that it is obvious that someone who is incapable of accepting the reality of being born as the sex that they , well , were born as , must be mentally ill . 
  in general , i am slightly confused as to why people insist more on changing reality to suit the needs of transgender people ( gender theory etc. ), 
  instead of trying to find out why transgender people feel the way they do . 
  clearly , violence , discrimination etc. 
  against transgender people is completely unacceptable , but refusing to believe in new potentially ill-founded conceptual system regarding gender is not violence or discrimination . 
  lying about your nationality , background , age etc. 
  should all be offenses that automatically invalidate your asylum application . 
  i want that graph !, 
  get on it , i want it on my desk by the end of the day .

  it is time to really start challenging the americans . 
  it is a common sentiment ( at least on reddit ) that a new space race should be encuraged , and not one that i disagree with . 
  there is pretty much no one good in syria . 
  some are less bad than others . 
  having assad stay in power and nothing change would have been preferabe to the current situation , but he would still have been an authoritan ruler who , evidently , is not that popular . 
  instability would have sparked sooner or later as long as this is the case . 
  at this point , it is pretty clear to me that having assad stay is impossible . 
  he has attacked his own people , sacrificed his own country to stay in power , and russia is the only one who wants to keep him . 
  what would the message be to the world if assad was accepted ( by the west ) ? 
  if someone threatens your authoritan power , just ruthlessly stamp out rebellion , even burn your country down , and people will yearn for you to be back in power ? 
  if you 're a dictator , just threaten your people with syria treatment if they complain ? 
  the world will accept a dictator strongman who does n't care about anyone but themselves as long as they keep the country at least somewhat stable ? 
  i do n't get people defending assad . 
  he could have appeased the people . 
  he could have given minor concessions like many other arab countries did . 
  but no , he opened fire on the protestors . 
  he literally would burn syria down just so he could continue ruling the ashes . 
  you visit r/europe too on your quest against `` anti-americanism '' and `` butthurt europeans '' ? 
  you must really be insecure yourself . 
  anyway , usa is the richest nation by gdp ( the eu as a whole is a close second , possibly even slightly ahead ) but not by gdp per capita , and not by median income . 
  usa has pretty insane wealth inequality . 
  i do n't think hundreds years of history and culture really matter as much as people think . 
  change can happen fast , and things that happened over a hundred years ago do n't necessarily have much effect on today . 
  for example , how much do finns today have in common with finns in 1916 ? 
  finland was still largerly an agrarian society , people lived in rural areas , the state of finland did n't even exist . 
  now finland is an independent country with a highly developed post-industrial services-based economy , most finns live in cities , the demographics have changed and so on . 
  what do we have in common with finns from 1916 ? 
  we speak the same languge , we occupy the same geographical area ( well , mostly , thanks to ussr ) , we have some of the same traditions , eat mostly similar foods , perhaps some customs ( like taking off shoes inside , or avoiding talking to strangers etc. ), 
  most of these are not necessarily great dividers between different nations . 
  i would argue that language is one of the greatest barriers , as it prevents communication between two groups without shared language and acts as a constant reminder that you belong to two different groups of people . 
  politically , things are also very different from a hundred years ago . 
  finland is an independent state now . 
  even in the past 20 years , politics has changed as the president has been stripped of certain powers . 
  joining the eu itself is a significant change in politics . 
  differences can be created fast , as we can see in the differences between east and west germany , but they can also be mended . 
  i do n't think eu can within meaningful timescales ( ie . 
  less than 100 + years ) ever become `` nation '' where people have only or even mainly an european identity and european customs , but that does n't necessarily prevent the eu from becoming something closer to a ( con ) federation with somewhat unified fiscal policies , unified foreign policy and even an eu army . 
  i believe there is room for even a somewhat nationalist views in the eu . 
  i think you can have your own beliefs , your own nation and own culture , but believe that you can work together with others with similar cultures and share an union with them to work together for the benefit of everyone in it . 
  there is some nonsense going around ( solar roadways !, 
  omg !!!! ), 
  regarding renewable energy , but do you seriously think that a country like china would care even the slightest about being `` pc '' ? 
  just because you think something is pc does not mean that it is not true . 
  a lot of people being politically incorrect also insist on being just plain old incorrect . 
  you must have been listening to the wrong energy industry experts , then . 
  renewable energy is booming even without subsidies in many countries all over the world , and the only thing limiting them at the moment is the price of energy storage . 
  and regardless , with climate change pressing on the world , the question is not really whether we can afford to change to renewables , but whether we can afford not to . 
  i would gladly support some new nuclear energy , though , especially some of the new technologies , but i have my doubts too . 
  in finland , a reactor has been under construction for nearly over a decade longer as it was supposed to and has cost three times as much as planned . 
  wait , so you want fossil fuels over renewables ? 
  you seem like an odd person . 
  seems that virtually all your posts are you trying to claim that usa is the best at something . 
  usa has hardly `` utterly dominated '' scientific developement in any field . 
  that is an extraordinary claim and you will need some pretty good research to show that if you want me to believe you . 
  also , what 's with the gibraltar flair ? 
  europe made usa , and most of those americans were either lf european descend or born in europe and moved to usa . 
  `` utterly dominated '' is nonsense regardless .

   this is the dumbest `` protest '' move i 've heard of in a while . 
  it 's not leftist in nature it 's just idiotic and very shortsighted . 
  lets just say most people are doing so simply becasue it gives off a `` fuck the police '' vibe then . 
  sometimes * they * should n't be let dictate the law and decide for themselves, 
  but hey , at least they got cheap pizza . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ what ^ ^ ^ ^ they ^ ^ ^ ^ do n't ^ ^ ^ ^ know ^ ^ ^ ^ is ^ ^ ^ ^ it 's ^ ^ ^ ^ becasue ^ ^ ^ ^ they ^ ^ ^ ^ are ^ ^ ^ ^ the ^ ^ ^ ^ new ^ ^ ^ ^ black ^ ^ ^ ^ market ^ ^ ^ ^ labour, 
   taxes will eventually rise , education quality will drop , after seeing you reply to an american regarding illegal immigration i was sure you wrote , ** texas ** will eventually rise, 
  the evil side of me that wants europe to do a u turn on this this horrible short sighted policy is really glad this is predicted to be a damm cold winter thanks to el ni\u00f1o . 
  putin will be happy for the extra gas sales though , maybe he 'll even send a few more refugees since badly insulated tent cities are a boon for him, 
  someone has been slipping too much estrogen in the germans drinking water it seems, 
  because it 's only controversial when used at a immigration protest right . 
  [ bet yet at a ttip rally bring on the guillotine ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ldeaekg.png ), 
  the people i see crying out on social media about this are really annoying me now thinking it 's some sort mass oppression against foreigners ( becasue they mostly run kebab/pizza places ) there are even people attending `` not asking for pizza receipt '' events so as to help anyone who was evading taxes or using black market labor even more . 
  the total idiocy of some do gooder leftists never ceases to amaze me especially when they are only encouraging race to the bottom economics in the pizza/kebab industry which will only resort in legal enterprises having to skip on taxes or hire cheaper slave labour to compete with the illegal guys thanks to their stupid protest . 
  but no , apparently simple logic and economics is racist instead , what happened the the smart inelegant leftists i used to know . 
  no i really hope you turn things around but that requires the people voting out all the people who propose their policy 's in the first place . 
  only you guys can make the u turn, 
  dude , sweden in particular has proven you guys are beyond reason , even with freaking extremist muslims who were once the head of a muslim anti defamation league actually later go to syria and join isis you still ca n't see the problems for what they are and believe in rehabilitating these people instead of prosecuting them on their return . 
  sorry if it 's spineless but when at this point you are still lecturing other countries to follow your failed example and spreading this ideology of looking past all the obvious problems and blaming the natives for not being tolerent enough i 've lost all sympathy . 
  better to remove the one bad apple now before it poisons every other country slowly, 
  80 % of the population live in that part of syria so it 's not really surprising . 
  more worrying is that 8 % think isis and al nusera should control the country, 
  too bad , better sweden and germany sink and be a lesson for everyone else than have that ship sail over here as it seems to be doing . 
  you should really learn to quote the offending comment so other people know what was wrong . 
  when you want to keep crows away from you crop you kill one and hang it up so others get the message and it works too . 
  that 's not entirely true , if you live in a city chances are you are connected up to a district heating system and get hot water piped into your home . 
  so yes gas which powers chp power plants which heat everyone 's home would be more accurate . 
  most hobs are electric though but not sure why people see gas as simply better . 
  electricity is also relatively cheap here too, 
   free trade is a net positive . 
  this is * managed trade * not free trade . 
  do n't abuse the nature of that term on such a shady deal of this, 
  and there was me thinking you were not posting here anymore . 
  wow i would have thought the ability to speak the language of a country would be the bare minimum requirement of citizenship . 
  i do n't know what to say . 
  how is citizenship gained there , i 'd assume that 's 5-8 years with no serious crime committed and you have to know the language and culture test ? 
  at least that 's how it goes here , many people who emigrated here twenty years ago still do n't have citizenship as they never learned enough language to pass a simple test, 
   and after today 's announcement that kd are withdrawing support from the current government coalition ( the so called december agreement ) , there may be new elections soon . 
  well that 's promising , there is calls from those in the finns party here to quit the government too . 
  unfortunately they is only because they have been stupid enough to not oppose migration and their support in the polls is dropping away fast . 
  here 's how i see it currently , for swedes denmark and finland is kind of like their backup option , but now that our country is going down insanity road as well i 'm seriously looking to estonia . 
  soon estonia * will * be nordic as everyone sane gets herded there, 
   working in health care , where people are brain washed . 
  is there not any sort of problem in sweden with muslim migrants refusing care from female medical professionals . 
  i 've hear of several cases in germany already, 
   i just do n't understand how they let this happen to them . 
  it 's shocking . 
  they do n't , they vote for sd and get called nazi 's at every opportunity so in effect they are the silent 25 % ( if recent polls are accurate ), 
   it 's inherent to the capitalist system that economies need to grow so in other words a ponzi scheme, 
  i 'd gladly work for the rest of my days while i 'm fit to do so , or perhaps have kids who can take care of me . 
  if that fails there is always my own savings and when they run out euthanasia . 
  migrants ca n't vote unless you are silly enough to give them citizenship for nothing, 
  i 'd much rather spend the winter on the beach in turkey than a tent in sweden , these people will riot and swedes will blame themselves for their failings and promise to take twice as many more to say sorry, 
  75 % of the time i fly i see the checking the name on the passport/id against the name on the boarding card at the gate as you board the plane . 
  swedish language is indeed redicilous . 
  if they struggle with `` g `` s and `` j `` s i think finns struggle most with `` p `` s and `` b `` s my english friend `` barry '' is basically `` parri '' or in the most unfortunate case where someone reads it `` parru '', 
  moderators can still make automoderator rules to remove all posts by a specific user effectively shaddowbanning someone from one subreddit, 
  nor should it be changed bu a few hundred people who think they know better and are susceptible to corruption, 
   when they are the victims they leverage international law maybe the eu should start leveraging international law , pushing back boats , closing borders , scraping `` quota 's '' and enforcing the rules then . 
  the eu has let down the countries that form it not the other way around, 
  well i do n't believe constitution should be change without a referendum in a perfect case, 
  exactly , so it was n't voted on by 2/3 of the population then . 
  representative democracy is n't a catch all term to say something represents the will of the people . 
  sometimes unpredictable shit happens and you ca n't expect politicians to reflect all your views on them in advance . 
   2/3 of the voters put anti-discrimination clauses into the constitution so there was a referendum on these laws then was there ? 
  i do n't know if this is an ethical or good idea without clear legislation on how peoples dna can be used in future . 
  what if framing the perfect crime now involves collecting a bit of dandruff from the person you want to frame or what if in the future some estonian goes on to be a picasso , tesla or casanova and after perfecting cloning and methods of getting pregnant via dna millions of women are having children without my will after death . 
  ^ ^ ^ yes ^ ^ ^ i ^ ^ ^ have ^ ^ ^ been ^ ^ ^ smoking ^ ^ ^ weed, 
  music and food are two things that can cross any culture without prejustice . 
  well i 'm on the outskirts of the city and it 's not like i did n't see them before from this location . 
  maybe i just missed it earlier, 
  to the endless stack of youtube videos it is for an hour or two then . 
  wat , you just made me go outside into tampere cold and i can see jack shit . 
  it was vaguely less dark in the middle of the sky and that was about it . 
  http://i.imgur.com/ea0dv3v.jpg year 2020 : it 's sad but i hear thanks to pc culture this is going to have to be destroyed becasue the media said we are all white supremacist nazis ... * sigh *, 
  tfw russia watches out for it 's citizens better than europe does . 
  if it was me i 'd put the other unemployed refugees to work and have them build some log cabins but that 's another matter, 
   nothing else matters . 
  that 's a shame , i hope the project to make sure swedish farts do n't smell does n't lose attention, 
  it 's hard to say what 's better . 
  as someone sick of the eu after this migrant disaster if britain leaves on one hand it will make it easier and more likely for other countries to follow their path but on the other side germoney will be even more powerful to force their crap on the rest of us ,, 
  country : finland favourite neighbour : estonia least favourite neighbour : swedenstan, 
  tents with heaters in sub zero temperatures seems like a great way to waste energy . 
  well urine is composed of urea so you 're not entirely wrong . 
  just realized i mixed up the meaning of diverse and adultery . 
  that was amateur but still pretty bad for cheating . 
   delving deeper into the moral views of both sharia and non-sharia supporters , research by pew indicates that 40 % of the roughly 1124 million muslims in the countries the question was asked support the execution of anyone who commits apostasy by abandoning faith in islam . 
  this translates into just over 454 million people who hold this view . 
  *  ** in the case of adultery , the applicable percentage is 52 % ** , or the equivalent of roughly 581 million people , who favor execution as the punishment . 
  sorry i missed the cpu bit not knowing germany party names . 
  still it 's pretty ironic how people who presumably preach tolerance toward refugees would spout such hatred toward someone for no reason only what they believe and ca n't prove and i can say i 've been called a racist in some similar facebook discussion for linking to an actual pew poll showing over 50 % of muslims support the death penalty for divorce . 
  have you got any sort of source to back that up , it seems like a semi relevant detail if it can be proven ? 
  if not well at worst i would say you were victim blaming based on her political beliefs . 
  you said it , i do n't know is it a european thing but compared to other cultures we have this habit of being really tolerant , saying `` yea thats bad but do n't do it again '' but then out of nowhere we are liable to flip the fuck out completely no holes barred . 
  i was under the impression a subtitle was ok by title rules . 
  ok will resubmit then but this would appear to be a new policy if so, 
  i think i 'm not going to bother arguing with someone who 's entire recent post history is almost defending this one plane . 
  you clearly have your mind made up despite the fact leaked reports which david axe cites actually is testimony of a pilot not just some pundit . 
  but yea i 'm sure everyone was wrong and you will be right but i have to say you are crazy when you say it 's better than the pak-fa when even the makers are now saying `` it 's not meant to be an air superiority fighter anyway ''  personally i wish we could get twice the amount of russia 's new stealth fighter for the price of that f-35 garbage, 
  it 's not nearly on par , the pak-fa is up there with the f22 and even beats it in some regards while suffering on others regarding the f-35 and it 's supposed supremacy they say 18 % of bvr missile launches hit the target so even if it 's stealth and avionics ( which i believe are overrated ) work as advertised there is still a good chance it will get into dogfight territory where it was destroyed by the f16 it 's replacing or as the test pilot remarked that `` it had pretty much no place fighting other aircraft within visual range . '',

  why ? 
  edit : nobody would have said anything if he had been said to be keynesian , bourdiean or hegelian thinker . 
  plus those pictures seemed older than 80s , when the system still worked somewhat well . 
  the bread lines were mostly a symptom of the system breaking down . 
  they were n't ( as prevalent ) during the soviet era as a whole . 
   most of the communist era photos look like propaganda photos . 
  in the '80s most romanians had to queue for hours just to get some meat or cooking oil . 
  keep in mind that during 80s the system was already breaking down due to several reasons that did n't exist ( or were n't prominent ) during the earlier decades . 
  if speaking purely of economic achievements , soviet union improved [ hell of a lot during ] ( http://i33.fastpic.ru/big/2013/0806/43/e3abf0a23e0fba69cf11833581f89443.jpg ) during it 's existence compared to almost any other economy before stagnating around 1975 . 
  sure , some of the pictures are propaganda , but so are the similar pictures from usa . 
  she was walking by , saw that somebody had died and the family had just thrown all the dead person 's property to the bin . 
  she went through it and found a nice frame she thought her husband would appreciate . 
  ( she was right . ), 
  edit : and i really hope that you do n't think so poorly of us finns that our president ca n't even dress properly . 
  it 's good that the president has swanky premises where to impress visitors . 
  the important thing is that when they leave the office the premises wont leave with them . 
  [ this picture of our former president going through the trash less than a year after leaving office fills me with as much pride as the pictures above . 
  ] ( https://haapavaara.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/1240216_10151587100232314_167375813_n.jpg ) edit : also while finland may only have population less than paris , it 's as big as 2/3 's of france . 
  having premises both in the capital and in the old capital was an important way to keep the population together back when travelling still took days . 
  edit2 : and while those buildings are costly to build , remember that the land they were built ( apart of the palace ) was most probably free . 
  there are very few topics where `` interests of society '' does n't mean `` beneficial for the people at the top '' . 
  but then , i 'm a socialist . 
   i edited my comment to better explain myself ... 
  i live in montreal which is not `` north '' but north enough that without switching times in the winter we would get no sunlight in the mornings . 
  yes , montreal is about the same lattitude as northern spain or southern france . 
  so , `` south '' as far as european pov goes , 
  unions and socialism are hardly the same thing . 
  my point was that it 's extremely confusing that the place that marks the utc does n't actually use it . 
  plus it 's good policy to give a new definition a new name . 
  i wonder how i would have gone about selling that cocaine . 
  it 's pretty much breaking bad , season 1 . 
  `` hello good sir , would you perhaps be interested in sampling my cocaine ? 
  finest product available , i 'll give you my word !, 
  yes , this is the first time i 'm selling , why do you ask ? '', 
  i 'm just going to copy the definition of gmt from wikipedia :   greenwich mean time ( gmt ) refers to the mean solar time at the royal observatory in greenwich , london , which became adopted as a global time standard . 
  so , the time in greenwich = global time standard . 
  but the observatory is following the british general time , yes ? 
  and they use dst . 
  which means that if we go by that definition , then everybody would have to switch clocks ( or define additional jumps ) when british legislation changes . 
  of course , this is all technical , but as we know , technically correct is best correct . 
  particularly when we 're talking of important stuff like time . 
  so a new definition had to be made . 
  and it would be a good thing if the new definition had it 's own name for clarity 's sake . 
  plus , you know , political sensibilities . 
  edit : which leads to this :   in the united kingdom , gmt is the official time during winter ; during summer british summer time ( bst ) is used . 
  you 're not a real european country if you do n't have a boring tricolour that looks exactly the same as every other tricolour in europe . 
  well , the observatory observes summertime , meaning utc is n't the same as observatory 's time . 
  talking of greenwich mean time is a bit silly when greenwich is n't in said time . . 
  you mean + / - 1 hour , due to utc not having dst , unlike the observatory . 
  all political stuff nonwithstanding , uk uses dst so greenwich-the-location is n't always on the same timezone as greenwich mean time . 
   when you live in the north dst is a godsend . 
  what are you talking about ? 
  no it does n't . 
  the sun does n't rise during winter and it does n't fall during summer . 
  you do n't see sun from late november to early february : add a month to both sides if you actually work for a living . 
  and of course , during summer it 's just the same thing but reversed : better be in bed by midnight if you do n't want to go to sleep when the sun rises at 01:00 . . 
  how much of that is uninhabited wilderness ? 
   you do n't have to be a good person or do something for the right reasons for one of the consequences of your actions to be good . 
  i would n't say the conclusion of ww2 was good . 
  it was followed by forced relocations of people ( both poland  germany and inside ussr ) , 40 + years of dictatorships , russificiation and large-scale destruction of cultural and environmental treasures . 
  it could have been worse , but that does n't make it good . 
   it says more about the nazis than the soviets to consider their defeat at communist hands to be a good thing . 
  what do you mean by this ? 
  personally i 've always felt that `` the only good thing soviets did was defeat the nazis '' was somehow hollow . 
  they were both assholes . 
  started ww2 together and if we look simply what both regimes had done until circa 1943 they look pretty similar , too . 
  if nazis had been on allied-side who knows what they would have done after the war ended ( i 'm not trying to be apologist , just pointing out that we 're comparing what nazis dreamed with what soviets did - and very seldom do dreams transform into reality 1:1 ) . 
  what i 'm saying here is that soviets ( or russia ) should n't be able to use `` at least they won the war '' as some sort of accomplishment . 
  if nazi - regime would have won and collapsed in 1990 we would be writing here `` at least nazis won the war against soviets '' . 
  but of course , i 'm biased . 
  most finno-ugric people did n't survive soviet union ( and neither did all my relatives ) . 
  ( seriously though , sputnik and the space program were pretty cool . ), 
  well , depends on the country . 
  it can also lead to finlandisation !, 
   global skin colour map i 'm not really into mercator but i can often see why it was chosen . 
  this time i 'm completely baffled . 
  the same could ( and can ) be said of bulgaria and romania . 
  but tying the area to brussels might be worth sacrifices . 
  ( i think the last few expansions were mistakes but seeing how russia acts now perhaps justifiable in hindsight . ), 
  well , the names are old . 
  sweden , estonia and russia date to at least viking-age , same probably goes for germany . 
  edit : and they 're all old local tribe-names that have since been extended to mean the whole country . 
  viro , for example , is only the northern-most county of present-day estonia . 
  `` tomorrow i go to school . '', 
  `` in one year i come probably back . '', 
  the finnish names follow the classic `` we do n't know what this is but need to have something on the translated map '' - scenario . 
  but : puola ( poland ) , sveitsi ( switzerland - interestingly , `` veitsi '' means knife ) , thaimaa , saksa ( germany ) , ahvenanmaa ( aland ) . 
  . . any more . 
  they actually got me . 
  why did you use `` conquered '' solely for hitler and not also for stalin ? 
  i 'm somewhat amazed this was approved before abortion . 
  yes , i 'm a true patriot . 
   how would a finn like madeira ? 
  yes please . 
  just waiting for retirement . 
   bees not everyone is distressed by bees , but i 've met a lot of people who are more scared of them that guns ( in the hands of people they trust ) . 
  there are people who follow politics actively . 
  it does n't matter limited the actual effects are when you know the process that created them . 
  iirc , he bought windows phones for the company but uses apple himself, 
  i did try to be subtle .

  the question is , how an 18 year old beta male knew the right people ? 
  the ones prepared before the coup . 
  freedom !, 
  \u00d6sterland reporting . 
  you are not wrong . 
  keep calm and lose your shit . 
  is correct . 
  scandinavia is the dick , we are the balls . 
  what did you call my mother ? 
  i would like to point out the distinct and complete lack of solanum tuberosum . 
  i tried that once , but my lungs froze and now am dead . 
  yeah , the dark blue area of finland is the area where there are more moose than people . 
  yes , let 's further discuss the intricacies of dicks and the names thereof . 
  that 's actually quite an accomplishment . 
  is this bad ? 
  i 'm pretty sure this is bad . 
  happy soviet oppression everyone !, 
  there is a period joke somewhere there . 
  this is your brain . 
  this is your brain on brexit . 
  questions ? 
  that is not a long run . 
  that 's a short run . 
  this is a problem pretty much everywhere . 
  you need either good connections or a metric fuckton of luck . 
  nationalism is just extended tribalism , and has been around since the beginning of time , in one form or another . 
  i think the common values we share are exhausted on the current eu . 
  going any further would rely on something that does n't exist . 
  so relevant !, 
  yes but euro is more like a religion , if you even think about leaving it you will be branded as apostate and blamed for everything that has gone or will go wrong . 
  i too would enjoy a mug of hitler did nothing wrong . 
  finnish and hungarian are completely and utterly mutually unintelligible . 
  the similarities are somewhere in the language structure ( such as using suffixes instead of prefixes ) . 
  in short , this so called ` xenophobia ' is a reaction against the abuse of given privileges , both real and perceived . 
  we 're not there yet . 
  this crisis shit with its associated deals and agreements is getting ( or already is ) so goddamn complicated that no-one understands it . 
  this collateral seems like a bluff to give some domestic politics points for the government . 
  to me it seems that if we are ever going to get the collateral , europe will be so busted that in wo n't matter . 
  all the time americans try to dispel the stereotype of the ignorant american and then their * presidential candidate * comes and does shit like this . 
  i kind of feel for them . 
  well , as far as i can tell the euro is seen as a symbol of european unification and it is at least partly a political concept . 
  this also shows in the expansion of the euro as requirements for entry were relaxed so that the currency would grow ( like the amount of public debt ) . 
  the failure of the euro would shame a lot of people in high places . 
  interesting stuff , thanks for sharing . 
  that makes sense , the eastern europe has been in a socio-economic stasis for 50 years . 
  but i ca n't help thinking there is more to it , since they now could just look to europe for example . 
  if they wanted . 
  they obviously do n't . 
  and therein lies the problem . 
  spent a week in croatia . 
  30 degrees night and day . 
  almost died . 
  yeah it 's a common thing in the east europe . 
  i do n't know what is going on , but it seems that slavs are very insecure about their sexuality . 
  wh ... what ? 
  i think the mystery is solved . 
  americans might not be dumber on average than europeans , but goddamn they are loud . 
  shut up for five minutes , geez . 
  oh you ... 
  what is this deal with east-european states and gays ? 
  what 's their problem ? 
  air-launched bunker-busting democracy . 
  same thing here . 
  i am actually more well off now , mortgage interest is at all time low and i 'm not too worried about my job , but the future of the country looks difficult . 
  but nokia did that to itself by not innovating . 
  so basically you have so little faith in your police/justice system that you need to be able to use deadly force ? 
  sounds scary . 
  he said motivation . 
  burglars generally come in to steal , not to kill . 
  unless you turn the situation into o.k. 
  corral . 
  this is the correct answer . 
  edit : except it of course screws the euro as it currently stands , but it might be screwed anyways . 
  basically , greece is out of options . 
  it needs its own currency or else it is fucked for the foreseeable future ( it may still be , but at least there would be some hope of recovery ) . 
  this is the crisis of the euro , and it maybe very well be that the euro splits into two for the very reason you stated . 
  the north does not want to be pulled under by the south . 
  of course private companies try to maximize their profits . 
  this is not news . 
  but it takes two to make a deal , and the greek politicians on the other end should have known better . 
  i vote for numbers !, 
  a loose trade union is imho a much better solution , something like the eu used to be or nafta is . 
  it is starting to look like even the euro was a step too far in the wrong direction . 
  to me it seems that the current trend is `` unification for the sake of unification '' . 
  same thing with finnish . 
  if you wanted to compare to the european situation , it would be that every major city would speak its own language . 
  you do know there are 20 + official languages in the eu as it is ? 
  a city is one thing , a country is another . 
  surely people with cultural differences can live together , but this is n't about being buddies with people who talk with funny accents . 
  this is about uniting already existing sovereign states with vastly different cultures , customs and histories into a single political entity . 
  and that is what i do n't see happening . 
  european similarities are only skin deep . 
  just look at the current debt crisis , europe is already divided between the fiscally responsible north and the crumbling , debt ridden south . 
  the reason for this is none other than the cultural differences . 
  i fail to see the point . 
   but in any case , i do see what you mean and i do see the benefits of an economic union . 
  it 's the political union i do n't understand . 
  if it is to reinforce the strength of our economic negotiating power , the same result can be achieved without a centralised power base . 
  but an economic union without a political one seems to be a recipe for disaster , as one can see from the current debt crisis . 
  to me it seems that we must have either independent states fending for themselves or a true federal union .

  seriously , that is just a cop out of a reason by central banks  and debt becoming bigger over time is good for the ordinary folk . 
  now you are getting closer to the mark but since home ownership rates are very low in sweden this is still a negative for the ordinary person as it means rising rents . 
  of course if we look through the bs 0 % interest rates ( all over the western banking system ) are just how the banking system is trying to inflate away all their bad debts from 2008 by pumping up asset prices to pre-crisis levels at the taxpayers expense again . 
  you know some of us actually would like some lower prices but for some twisted reason that 's wrong . 
  got ta keep inflating that wealth away from the ordinary folk i guess, 
  / r/circlejerk    , 
  [ i think i found an infiltrator ] ( http://i.imgur.com/8wyvkdz.png ) also that was totally worth watching in hd ... sorry hungary, 
  you do realize treating innocent people 's opinion as less than human or `` bots '' even is exactly the way the nazis made it easy for people to not give a shit about the jews . 
  an here people are on a european subreddit telling people their views do n't matter because they are russian, 
   sikorski said that putin had made the proposal to donald tusk , who at the time was polish prime minister , still 100 % wrong . 
  first barasso and his `` putin says he can take kiev in two weeks '' bs statement and now this ... and they say there is no such thing as western propaganda , i doubt very much both these retractions will get 10 % the airtime the first statements did . 
  so they blew up their own ammo factory with missiles they do n't even possess . 
  yes the particular characteristics of torture and force feeding of prisoners on hunger strike . 
  now why are they on hunger strike do you think ? 
  it 's every single bit as bad any any gulag but just on a slightly smaller scale to every except strikingly stupid idiot 's like yourself with their heads in the sand, 
  and yours are childish  i 'll try to keep a balance, 
   whats the tipping policy ? 
  put simply , you do n't, 
  wow , you are only 6 years slow in realizing you ca n't throw money at problems ~ ~ goldman sachs ~ ~ ecb . 
  * slow clap *, 
  what an astounding waste of money and just as finland 's economy ships into recession and parents get their child benefit cut . 
  i find it funny this news is coming from `` radio free europe '' which was literally setup by the cia as a propaganda source in the first cold war, 
  how would you describe guantanamo bay . 
  oh and lol at the blowhards downvoting me, 
   you go to gulag just because fuck you !, 
  you do n't get to ask questions because you 're going to gulag . 
  so what does that make guantanamo bay then ? 
  say if you have over two million prisoners in your country where many are given the death penalty , could that be technically comparable to the gulags ? 
  i know we are not going to agree so i will just leave it here , my point is made . 
  she asked a story not be published `` because it would be damaging to the national security '' how is that not censorship ? 
  and yea i can agree the usa might not explicitly censor information on a day to day basis but they do choose to not report on topics which is pretty much the same thing when editors act as gatekeepers for what does and does not get published . 
   what did i lie about ? 
  where did i say you lied ? 
  you just left out half the story . 
   the topic is russia . 
  china is the biggest proponent of censorship and propaganda . 
  agreed , but you actually just said * '' the countries that despise freedom of press are the biggest proponents of propaganda '' * with no mention of censorship in your last post . 
  but i disagree with your `` usa does n't censor '' stance anyway , it 's there and right at the very top too [ condoleezza rice named as killer of new york times ' story on cia ] ( http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/oct/13/condoleezza-rice-named-as-killer-of-new-york-times/ ) but like you said , maybe it 's a story for another thread . 
  why do n't you mention how it 's proven the us and * especially * israel do this also ? 
  well that 's * our * choice and free will . 
  i see it like this ... you do n't have kids ... ok do n't expect anyone to care for you when you are older either . 
  what i do n't like is the baby boomer generation who are in power now not being able to provide jobs for the young europeans they did manage to spawn but then telling also them we need to import more people because they were too busy enjoying life to have more kids to look after them when they get old . 
  talk about a spoiled generation . 
  and poland who beat germany in the last game ? 
  is n't there enough people on this continent ( and the world ) already to be unsustainable in the long term without petrochemicals and nitrogen fertilizers ? 
  the least we could be doing in europe is being a good example and reducing our population somewhat, 
  never seen someone so worked up over a draw, 
  what do you define as `` leftism '' opposing tax cuts for top earners no doubt / s, 
  better go edit wikipedia then, 
  you 're right , i totally forgot about dunnes, 
  i just put that there during the who protest thing , i 'm more a a traveling gypsy right now after making my money in bitcoin a couple of years ago . 
  these days i just daytrade from whatever country i happen to be in . 
  that said i 've thought about buying an apartment in ukraine now since they are dirt cheap with the currency on the floor and when they open up their property market to non nationals the prices will double as happened in romania . 
  if there was every a place to speculate on land/property now it 's there . 
  unfortunately i just see the eu as a revolving door that eats up economies and leaves you with multinational corporations controlling all in the end . 
  just look at how foreign companies control nearly 100 % of ireland 's supermarket sector right now and soon you will have the water owned by private interests . 
  not bitter ( i 'm an irish ex-pat ) more embarrassed, 
  ok i 'll go with `` semi-tax haven '' as it 's defined on wikipedia  other sovereign countries that have such low tax rates and lax regulation that they can be considered semi-tax havens are : [ 30 ]  ireland [ 31 ]  netherlands -- primarily a conduit tax haven [ 29 ] http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tax_haven#examples, 
  it 's my view until all the bad debts are removed from the european banking sector nothing good can come . 
  unfortunately things were not let take their natural course in 2008 so we have to drag it all out over the next decade or so . 
  no it 's not , unless you count building a recovery on becoming a tax haven and bowing down to the whims of multinational corporations, 
  do n't worry if it 's not privatized yet it will just as soon as the taxpayer is done paying for the meter installation, 
   usa 's money supply is given to the entire world . 
  yes you export your inflation abroad , congratulations on being a burden/leach on the entire world economy . 
  i 'm still waiting for the day i read `` made in usa '', 
  yes i am a computer science major with a minor in economics because my course is tailored to the financial sector . 
  you know just tell me what you think of these figures , since my education has thought me money moving is what makes the world go round so look at us money velocity over the past decade http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/m2v, 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/money_supply#united_states how many dollars are in existence has been rising faster and faster than inflation and is only picking up speed . 
  when more money is printed your % share of the total pie goes down and therefore it is inflation . 
  the only reason this inflation has not been evidenced in what you say `` america has n't had 5 % inflation in something like 25-30 '' is because this money is only going to the 1 % at the top . 
  that said sooner or later this will `` trickle down '' as they say and inflation will be insane, 
  yes it is necessary to grow it to an extent but the usa has been averaging 5 % per year over the last decade or 50 % over ten years . 
  this is a lot more than 2 % for inflation, 
  consumer inflation is different than inflation of the money supply . 
  the inflation of the dollar money supply has been 50 % in the last 10 years , the only reason this has n't affected prices so much is because that money is not reaching main street but plugging holes in bad bank balance sheets, 
  explain how it 's wrong them . 
  if you look at the history of the number of dollars in existence it 's clearly started getting exponential in the last decade . 
  now tell me one fiat currency that survived 100 years , i 've noticed people downvote but nobody can do that one simple thing, 
  you ca n't use the current focus of my criticism as as a case in point against it, 
  the us money supply has doubled since 2001 , give me one example where a fiat currency with a rapidly increasing money supply that did n't fail and i 'll shut right the fuck up . 
  go for it, 
  my god , someone who finally gets it . 
  thank you, 
   which is why the usd is strengthening , right ? 
   usd is strengthening right now as in a world getting more crazy by the minute it 's backed up by the biggest army , ( not something to be proud of if you ask me )  also : you 're irish , not ukrainian . 
  you 've admitted this multiple times . 
  you do n't live in ukraine . 
  all you use that flag for is so people think your opinion carries a little more weight when you suck putin 's cock . 
  are you the flair police or what ? 
  is there such a thing or is this just more american hubris showing itself . 
  do you ever think i do n't change it now because it clearly pisses off people like you as evidenced by the fact you bring it up in nearly every reply you make to me . 
  kisses x, 
  looks to me like you are just trying discredit the poster by putting words in their mouth they did n't in fact say . 
   because we implemented quantitative easing instead of forcing austerity why do n't people just call it what it really is ... money printing . 
  fancy names only hide the fact you are only diluting your money supply and exporting the inflation overseas which is n't really * helping * your economy but just accelerating the pace at which other nations seek alternatives to the dollar . 
  what would really help would be real infrastructure development and capital intensive public works . 
   i 've res-tagged you as a irishmen who has never been or lived in ukraine ever since the first confession . 
  wrong i 've been to both ukraine and russia and probably know more about those places than a yank commenting in a european sub . 
  i 've seen the world from multiple perspectives and not just the usual western angles or college kid who think they are worldly and cultured because they spend time on a beach in bali . 
   and it has a lot to do with the topic , as you 're misrepresenting yourself .

  what 's the croatian word for gypsy ? 
  what do you mean ? 
  there are several groups of travellers which are referred to as `` gypsies '' in english , and the romani are probably the most famous one . 
  they 're definitely gypsies . 
  you 're not contributing to the conversation . 
  it varies from language to language , but the english word `` gypsy '' is a catch-all term for all european nomadic peoples . 
  the largest and most famous of these groups is the [ romani people ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/romani_people ) or roma people , a traditionally nomadic people who migrated to europe from india in the 16th and 17th centuries . 
  often the words `` gypsy '' and `` romani '' are used interchangeably . 
  in the past roma were travellers and mostly worked as tinkers , farriers and peddlers . 
  however , in modern society the need of these jobs has declined sharply . 
  not all romani are nomadic , and nowadays many live sedentary lives and are integrated to mainstream society . 
  for example in finland there are no traveling gypsies . 
  the romani culture is characterized by a strong sense of community , respect for one 's elders , and strict rules regarding ritualistic purity and taboos . 
  the history of the romani people resembles that of the jews . 
  in many countries vagrancy was a crime , and travellers were often persecuted and subjected to ethnic cleansings . 
  the nazis committed a genocide against the romani people , murdering dozens of thousands of them . 
  the modern situation of the roma is very complicated and varies from country to country . 
  in some countries they 're semi-integrated , live in houses , and have jobs . 
  in other countries , especially in eastern europe , the situation is more difficult . 
  many of the gypsies live in trailer parks or ghettoes , refuse to follow the law , do n't send their children to school , and live by organized crime like pick pocketing gangs . 
  on the other hand , many of the non-gypsies are very prejudiced and racist towards them and treat them badly . 
  in my opinion there is a big attitude on both sides . 
  of course , even in these countries many gypsies are normal , law-abiding citizens , but people only notices the pickpockets and muggers . 
  there are many other nomadic peoples who are commonly referred to as `` gypsies '' . 
  these include [ irish travellers ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/irish_travellers ) , [ scottish travellers ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/scottish_gypsy_and_traveller_groups ) and the [ yenish people ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/yenish_people ) . 
  many of these people are n't travellers anymore , though . 
  i do n't know enough about these people to tell about them . 
  here the old word is * mustalaiset * . 
  people use * romanit * in official situations , because it 's the politically correct word and some people consider * mustalaiset * to be offensive . 
  * mustalaiset * is n't really a bad word though , most people do n't use it in a mean way . 
  the gypsies call themselves * kaale * , but i do n't think outsiders are supposed to use that word . 
  then there 's * manne * which is a mean slur . 
  that 's not quite true . 
  `` gypsies '' can also refer to any romani people , even if they 're not travellers anymore . 
  germany is a big and influential country , though . 
  i think it kinda sucks being a small and weak country . 
  big countries can do whatever they want , while the small ones have to try not to upset them . 
  it 's hilarious , like watching a train wreck !, 
   they are viscous the word you 're looking for is `` vicious '' . 
  * viscous * means `` a substance that has a thick , sticky consistency between solid and liquid '' . 
  yeah , if they want to save europe , they should get rid of their putinist president . 
  a bunch of racist , ignorant idiots . 
  we do n't have any . 
  socks and woolen sock if it 's cold . 
  i 'm not sure if it 's considered european , but i really like kalaallisut aka west greenlandic . 
  [ this is what it sounds like ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzhymmnr05e&amp;t=0m17s ) . 
  i 've posted this same thing in r/unsolvedmysteries : the [ lake bodom murders ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lake_bodom_murders ) . 
  it 's the most famous unsolved mystery in finland , and a crazy case . 
  there 's even a heavy metal band called * children of bodom * . 
  on the 5th of july 1960 four teenagers , two girls and two boys , went camping on the shore of lake bodom . 
  during the night someone attacked the teenagers . 
  three of them died from skull injury and stab wounds . 
  the fourth teenager , nils gustafsson was found alive , but gravely injured and semi-unconscious . 
  he had received a hard blow which had fractured his skull . 
  gustafsson claimed to have no recollection of the night . 
  _____________________________________ there are four main suspects : ** 1 . 
  pentti soininen , a criminal ** in the late 1960s pentti soininen , an inmate in kuopio prison serving time for multiple crimes , confessed to having committed the lake bodom murders . 
  at the time of the murders soininen had been 15 years old . 
  having run away from a reformatory , he had indeed been close to lake bodom during the night the murders . 
  the police interrogated soininen , but found his confession to be unreliable . 
  soininen was known to be a psychopath who could act in a very strange and unpredictable way , especially under the influence of alcohol and drugs . 
  in 1969 soininen committed suicide by hanging himself . 
  valdemar gyllstr\u00f6m , a man who hated campers ** valdemar gyllstr\u00f6m owned a kiosk near lake bodom . 
  gyllstr\u00f6m was notoriously hateful towards campers , and would often act aggressively . 
  there is a rumor that gyllstr\u00f6m confessed to his neighbor while drunk . 
  during the investigation gyllstr\u00f6m 's wife confirmed his alibi , saying that they had spent the whole night together . 
  however , before her death the wife said that her husband had threatened to kill her if she told the truth . 
  in 1969 gyllstr\u00f6m drowned in lake bodom , either accidentally or on purpose . 
  hans assmann , an ex-nazi ** ( yes , i know , it 's a funny name ) hans assmann was a german immigrant . 
  in his youth assmann had been a staunch nazi , and had started working as a guard in auschwitz concentration camp at the age of 19 . 
  on the day after the murders assmann was brought to helsinki hospital . 
  he was acting in a very strange way , and was aggressive and nervous . 
  he was very disheveled and had dirt under his fingernails and red stains on his clothes . 
  he lied about the reason for his disheveled appearance . 
  there 's an unfounded rumor that assman had been employed by the kgb after the war . 
  some conspiracy theorists claim that the government hushed up assmann 's crimes because they feared soviet retaliation . 
  assmann has also been linked to several other famous finnish murder cases . 
  he somewhat enjoyed his bad reputation and would often fan the flames by saying creepy things . 
  assmann did , however , have a near-perfect alibi : he had spent the night with his mistress in the same apartment with her sister and brother-in-law . 
  according to them , it would have been impossible for assmann to leave the house during the night without someone noticing . 
  the red stains on assmanns clothing were red paint , and his strange behavior was caused by drunkness . 
  nils gustafsson , the fourth teenager . 
  ** it 's possible that gustafsson killed his friends and either purposefully injured himself , or was hurt by his struggling victims . 
  in 2004 , the police announced that they had discovered new evidence thanks to modern dna - technology . 
  gustafsson was suddenly arrested on suspicion of having committed the lake bodom murders . 
  the result of the trial was `` not guilty '' . 
  i like to do that when i 'm get bored at the airport . 
  yeah , i 'm also surprised about finland being there . 
  i have no idea . 
  i guess our ancestors were a bunch of perverts .

  well , * testicle wax * could also be `` stool wax '' and * christmas booze danger * could also be `` christmas booze hill '' . 
  other than that they ca n't possibly mean anything else . 
  greece or italy . 
  i 've posted these before , but here you go : - homeperseensuo ( moldy ass swamp ) - koirankyrp\u00e4oja ( dog dick ditch ) - nahkahousut ( leather pants ) - pallivaha ( testicle wax ) - rovastinnanpillu ( senior priest 's wive 's pussy ) - vihelt\u00e4v\u00e4n vitun aapa ( bog of the whistling pussy ) - neekerisaari ( negro island ) - per\u00e4pukama ( hemorrhoid ) - pervonkallio ( pervert 's rock ) - h\u00e4t\u00e4paskanl\u00e4hde ( emergency shit spring ) - vittuvilkkamalampi ( pond of flashing pussies ) - saaranpaskantamasaari ( island shat by sarah ) - joulu-viinavaara ( christmas booze danger ) - persehuokonen ( ass pore ), 
  yes , but it 's less corrupt the any other country on earth . 
  there 's a finnish guy called [ johan b\u00e4ckman ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/johan_b\u00e4ckman ) who lives in russia and works as a kremlin propaganda machine . 
  he 's an all around charming person : - he claims that russian immigrant children that are being taken care of by finnish child protection authorities are living in `` concentration camps '' , and accuses finland of a `` genocide of children '' . 
  he has not provided numbers for how many children are supposed to have been killed in this alleged `` genocide '' , and has not revealed any sources for his information .

  in true communist utopia you 'd need no money because you would get everything from the state or by bartering it directly with other people . 
  when you look at this `` end goal '' it 's no wonder why `` pure communism '' will never work in large scale . 
  it can work to some degree in small village sized communities where pretty much everyone is dependent on their one another for survival . 
  it would n't surprise me in the least if it came out that the coup was attempted because someone had leaked the ` list ' to army and some hotheads decided to `` act before it 's too late '' . 
  poland does n't have a winter . 
  only winter it has is at the tatra in the south where the ski resorts are . 
  no wonder when you sack over 50,000 government officials in one go . 
  you would think they must grow on trees to replace all of those who are sacked . 
  you seems to be going all the way down this time . 
  here 's another fine [ example ] ( http://poritieto.com/images/b/b2/ruosniemen_kirkko.jpg ) to the list of fugliest churches in finland . 
  honestly you ca n't make a church much more `` unchurch '' than that . 
  maybe they have the italian style permissions that can be issued after you have started building ? 
  well , better make it quick than drag it on and on like a bad joke . 
  wee , we have a new `` wicked witch of the west '' . 
  i wonder if she 's going to be as tough old ewe as thatcher was in her day . 
  it 's usually 210cm 's which does n't do much difference ... 
  always nice to know that there 's an artsy fartsy name for something that in finnish is simply `` oven baked ice cream '' and which we made in home economics class in school . 
  glass prison however is still a prison . 
  also as they have live off a set distance ( 2miles or so iirc ) from places where minors may frequent ( usually public parks ) some municipalities in florida use this as a tactic to drive them away or in that one interviewed case to live under a bridge or be forced leave the town , however since the law is state wide this often means leaving florida all together . 
  and tax frauds ... man those sentences are usually fucking draconian once the sentence is finally announced because nobody fucks with the tax office and gets away with it . 
  huh ? 
  they actually let that satanist nut-hole out already ? 
  i wonder at what grounds that guy was declared sane enough to bet let out . 
  then again `` monimurrrhaaja m\u00f6r\u00e4nen '' aka mika muranen and ilpo larha have also been released a couple of years a go , i recall . 
  5-2 is a lot of goals in that level of football .

  well diesel used to be like twice as cheaper than gasoline in the usa so they were even more thirsty and clunky than gasoline engines ... 
  i would n't buy an american made & designed car with a diesel engine if my life would depend on it . 
  indeed mpg is ** miles per gallon ** and other is ** liters per 100kilometer ** so 15mpg = ( 1,6 * 15km ) / 3,785 l = 24km / 3,785 l = 24km / 3,785 l = 6,3 km / l = 100km / 6,3 l = 15,8 l / 100km my citroen relay / jumper as it called has a mileage of 46miles per gallon so 5,14 l / 100km though my car computer tells me a 9-10l / 100km which i think is closer to actual usage figures then those by the manufacturer . 
  edit : uuhh math and units :p, 
  thats patently wrong then . 
  i have a 2 months old citroen relay-van with `` only 130hp '' straight 2l engine and it consumes around 8l/100km that gm gas guzzler slurps 10l minumum per 100km more likely 15l/100km assuming its anything like old chrysler saratoga with 3.0 l v6 was that i had at one point . 
  i have a feeling that eu has really dropped the ball on informing the general public what actually goes on in the eu and what it represents . 
  part of the reason is that if a bomber has to turn back it ca n't land if it has a full payload so dumping the bombs into uninhabited area or sea or anywhere that 's below you if you in enemy territory , was the safest bet to get the plane back in one pice . 
  does a retired president count ? 
  we have one to `` spare '' though his close to hundred years old now . 
  only good thing turning up from brexit to eu . 
  i whole hartedly agree on thsi sentiment either ** stay ** or ** gtfo ** but your days as a mother of all of free loaders in eu are over . 
  well pardon me for not speaking particularly good french and thus mistaking that muscadet is a type of wine instead of ` nutmeg ' . 
  unsurprisingly more than half of those sausages originate from germanic speaking areas . 
  the germans sure used to love sausages and brought them where ever they went or settled . 
  it 's probably in their dna or something to eat and promulgate the use of sausages . 
  i 'm surprised that there is n't a wine marinated sausage in the list , considering the amount of wine based dishes in france . 
  so , people with pensions voted no ... not a great surprise really . 
  yea , i doubt that gb would like that too much either but some kind of self-rule or semi-autonomy could work . 
  and ironically most of them are against `` refugees '' from pakistan and india but hey do n't let the facts cloud your judgment . 
  how ever it 's conveniently buried that the parliament is in no way compelled by the outcome of the actual vote , aside from occasional riots that might ensue . 
  the whole vote thing is/was a publicity stunt from the political animal cameron to save his own ass after impossible promises about eu in 2013 elections . 
  i was expecting `` red dawn '' and i got `` west wing '' and i was rather disappointed for obvious reasons . 
  in some parts it was believed that once you had found the magic fern aarnivalkea aka treasure fire would point the spot for hidden treasure . 
  in others it was the ghost of the former master of the homestead who would point the place for the treasure but only in midsummer night would he appear . 
  ( no magic fern needed ), 
  no it 's literally the middle of summer after which the nights start to get darker again and the days beging to shorten towards th winter . 
  do n't forget to get wild if they remembered to include `` two minutes to midnight '' in their play set , 
  sounds familiar ... you know , lithuanian and finnish folklore seems to share a lot when it comes to ukon juhla aka summer solstice aka st. john 's feast/day . 
  do you also hunt the magic treasure ghosts at solstice and run naked three times around the well in hopes of seeing your future husband 's image reflected on the water ? 
  you know what would happen if the agricultural subsidies were abolished ? 
  first of all we 'd have about 100 000 new unemployed and secondly your daily food bill would triple . 
  just kindly shut up already about the agri subs tuliniemi it 's getting really old & annoying to read since you obviously have n't even the slightest idea of european agriculture and it 's economical realities . 
  i 'm willing to bet you do n't even know ( without googling it ) why the system was implemented in the first place . 
  especially if it 's led by a german chairman who was n't born in germany ... 
  in helsinki we have `` mogadishu avenue '' because a lot of refugees from somalia settled there at -90 's once being granted asylum . 
  i ca n't recall them ever complaining about the nickname . 
  reminds me of this old sketch https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh3rd0j4u1w about finns complaining to russia about air space violations during the cold war . 
  from 2:10 - look , we have a very serious matter to talk about - i see ... - your plane has violated our air space and we wo n't tolerate it - you wo n't tolerate ? 
  - no we wo n't - well in that case i 'm afraid i 'll have to ask you a pointed question .

  honestly , 24m/s is n't anything unusual in finland . 
  there 's been 36m/s winds recorded during major one like tapani a few years back . 
  however the time of the year is . 
  the storms usually coincide with the warming and cooling of atlantic at early spring and late fall about the time when the arctic sea begins freezing or melting .
