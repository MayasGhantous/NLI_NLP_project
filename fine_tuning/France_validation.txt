   but what percentage of lithuanians did they kill ? 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/soviet_war_crimes#lithuania even in absolute numbers , they do n't come really close to the number of jewish killed in lithuania . 
   they surpassed it . 
  just not on jews , but lithuanians . 
  besides use numbers show me the numbers then . 
  you 're lithuanian . 
   soviet union repressed my family , nazi germany did not . 
  sorry , but personally for my family soviet union was worse . 
  by that logic the nazis were great for germans and not so great for others . 
  you should ask a german what he thinks about your theory . 
  history is not the experiences of one individual . 
   i agree that they are both evil no , you are claiming that both are ** equally evil ** . 
  which is flat out wrong and unhistorical . 
   the article starts with `` the baltic ultranationalists rewriting east european history as an equal nazi-soviet ` double genocide ' must be stopped '' . 
  somehow it feels like reading some russian propaganda . 
  well let 's look at the percentages then . 
  nazis and locals in lithuania killed 95 % of jewish . 
  what percentage of people did the soviets kill ? 
   soviet union was an enemy of estonia but that does ** not mean ** that the soviet union was ** equal ** to nazi germany . 
  it 's not russian propaganda to state this obvious fact . 
   why ca n't we just say that both nazis and soviets are evil ? 
  why do we have to love soviets because they killed less people in some other country ? 
  well again that 's explained in the video . 
   you sent me some low quality video with unknown people talking in an empty room , how does it prove anything ? 
  it 's the same guy that wrote this article . 
  enjoy . 
  it simply changed nazi occupation with bolshevik occupation and continued the crimes against the people from these countries . 
  comparing nazi occupation with soviet occupation is a spat on the face of the holocaust . 
  95 % of jewish were killed in lithuania . 
  did the soviets even come close to such numbers over there ? 
  the theories that nazis are just as worse as the soviets simply do n't hold any water . 
  take romania now for example . 
  50 % of jewish were exterminated . 
  were 50 % of romanians exterminated by the nazis ? 
  on 29th of june 1941 , romanian authorities , romanian police and romania army gathered up and killed 13266 jewish people in iasi . 
  when was the first memorial put in place ? 
  of course romanians will think that soviets were just as worse as nazis . 
  from one side they constantly get all the info on the crimes committed by the soviets , from the other side ... a city where 13200 jews were murdered did n't have any memorial and * still * does n't have a holocaust museum . 
  to see pictures of those killed , to see what happened etc. 
  yeah sorry historical and societal arguments can not be made in 5 min videos . 
  : / you are the one that claims the soviets were annihilating just as much as the nazis . 
  well 95 % of jewish in lithuania were killed . 
  that 's a very effective killing machine . 
  did the soviets achieve the same percentage of success ? 
   to become same evil they fought against . 
  are they the same evil though ? 
  the holocaust in the baltic states was extremely effective . 
  90 % of jewish were killed . 
  in lithuania alone 95 % of jewish were killed . 
  that 's extremely high rates of extermination . 
  https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/jan/08/holocaust-baltic-lithuania-latvia and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p69thx4vo8c, 
   less meat or meat of a different animal is n't the same ballpark as less sugar . 
  can you give any examples of a product at the same price point in ee and we that have less meat ? 
   for example 7 days mini croissants comes in spumante ( sparkling wine ) flavour in poland and \u010cere\u0161\u0148a ( cherry ) flavour in slovakia , but mainly kakao flavour in germany . 
  well that 's plain gross . 
   he 's a social-democrat , like mitterrand was or like corbyn is dude , do you know anything about french politics ? 
  and football and rugby are english, 
  is it the same brand of tuna can ? 
  or just all tuna cans should be the same ? 
  that 's like saying all baguettes should be the same wherever you buy ... not going to happen . 
   it is . 
  this is like saying the people in czech republic are less human than people in germany or have that their live have less value . 
  you enter the thorny discussion about what `` quality '' is . 
  how hard is it to find good baguettes outside france ? 
  should the eu regulate on that so that if you call something a baguette it should have the same quality as in france ? 
  what about croissants ? 
  that i have no doubt . 
  the same goes for berlusconi . 
   but any comparison between him and trump is an insult to everybody 's intelligence . 
  well i guess that 's what it boils down to . 
  omg trump is so bad and americans are so stupid ... at least our leader was n't thaaat incompetent . 
  yeah ... yeah he was . 
  in the 90s , italy friggin mattered at the table of eu politics . 
  it mattered also because it had an economy of comparable size with that of france of uk . 
  in 3 years , us economy will do just fine , at it has been . 
  sure at an international stage , us ' image will be tainted . 
  but it does n't even come close to the ridiculous levels berlusconi achieved in undermining italian economy * and * international image . 
   based on how you 're talking , it seems like you were n't even born when berlusconi left italian politics . 
  let 's just say that i 'm old enough to remember that in the 90s , italy had a stong enough economy to actually matter in eu politics . 
  nowadays ... well , i do n't think i need to continue speaking . 
   gdp growth is not the only indicator of the stability of an economy oh gdp shows that we 're fucked ... welp . 
  better ignore it . 
   but italian economic woes are to be blamed on the public debt the italian governments took on in the 1980s at insane interest rates that forced successive governments into permanent austerity to pay the interest on that debt well by the time berlusconi got to power at the beginning of the naughts , well https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3a%2f%2fblogs.ft.com%2fftdata%2ffiles%2f2016%2f05%2fitalian_net_government_interest_payments-column_chart-ft-web-themelarge-600x396.png?source=next&amp;fit=scale-down&amp;width=600 the interests paid stabilised . 
  sure it was high , but it was n't as high as the previous decade . 
  now compare gdp growth in the 90s vs gdp growth in the 00s . 
  [ and you 'll realise that berlusconi did shit . ] ( https://www.google.fr/publicdata/explore?ds=d5bncppjof8f9_&amp;met_y=ny_gdp_mktp_kd_zg&amp;idim=country:ita:fra:esp&amp;hl=en&amp;dl=en#!ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=ny_gdp_mktp_kd_zg&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=region&amp;idim=country:ita:fra:esp&amp;ifdim=region&amp;tstart=485042400000&amp;tend=1431727200000&amp;hl=en_us&amp;dl=en&amp;ind=false ) . 
  he was given a country that was in much better health than in the decades before , and managed to shit all over it . 
  things were starting to be stabilised . 
  meanwhile the us does n't really show any signs of being under threat . 
   actually the italian economy started to sink after berlusconi left . 
  http://www.economist.com/node/18780831  between 2000 and 2010 italy 's average growth , measured by gdp at constant prices , was just 0.25 % a year . 
  of all the countries in the world , only haiti and zimbabwe did worse . 
   with is psd increasing public sector wages at an exaggerated rate , at the detriment of infrastructure investment . 
  you 're losing doctors , nurses and teachers faster than you 're losing quality of roads . 
  the brain drain is something you can not afford . 
   berlusconi on the other hand started as a cruise singer and become a billionaire . 
  who gives a flying fuckaroo ? 
   a guy like trump would have not resisted a week in our politics the fact that berlusconi lasted so long is significative . 
  i 'll leave you with a tiny quote : http://www.economist.com/node/18805327  as our special report in this week 's issue points out , only zimbabwe and haiti had lower gdp growth than italy in the decade to 2010 . 
  in fact gdp per head in italy actually fell .

germany ( with turks ) and the u.k. did not significantly fail to nearly the same extent as the others . 
  saying so is drastically oversimplifying the situation, 
  so you 'd rather they just never did ? 
  this is really confusing . 
  i always thought that `` roma '' referred to all gypsies . 
  not to confuse them with ethnic romanians . 
  i do n't ow what a non-roma gitano would be . 
  first of all , that 's not true . 
  race is an important stratifying voter demographic but it is by far the only one . 
  urban vs residential , age , gender , income , and education level are all important . 
  and you generally find similar levels of stratification between the two parties in those . 
  secondly , that 's not even what you said at all . 
  you said `` one party for whites ... '' implying that everyone who is white votes r , and everyone else votes d. that 's laughable . 
  `` all republicans are white '' = / = `` all whites are republican '' , not by a long shot . 
  the majority of the democratic party is still white , as is the majority of the voting bloc as a whole . 
  sometimes i wonder which is worse ; the average european redditor 's understanding of the us political situation , or the average american redditor 's understanding of europe 's . 
  i still believe the latter is worse , but every once in a while there 's a gem like this that makes me reconsider . 
  i think that 's bullshit . 
  the presence of indians and pakistanis in the uk is not because of british white guilt . 
  have you even been to any of these countries or are you just going by what you read on reddit ? 
  yeah , the united kingdom is clearly encouraging all of these people to come ... 
  maybe one of these european countries will let him immigrate if he sucks up enough, 
  french life is n't the one they see/hear about in the media and tv and internet . 
  also they do n't want to learn a new language . 
  most of these guys are from ex-british colonies so they know some english , much easier than trying to deal with the strange french . 
  note that they could all easily get to germany but do n't even want that . 
  i was reading that most of them plan to just work illegally in britain rather than claim asylum ( probably an indication of how weak their asylum claim would be ) . 
  close but not quite . 
  the `` aryans '' referenced by the name `` iran '' does not refer exclusively to persians but to a larger grouping of people 's from the region of which the persians are the most prominent of . 
  this broader group of peoples are thought to be descended from the indo-european migrations who all share a common ancestral , cultural and linguistic background . 
  the persians are merely the largest and most prominent subgroup of these peoples , which also includes the kurds ( supposedly descended from the medes , the first group to be widely referred to as aryans in ancient sources ) , tajiks , and other smaller groups which are all closely related to persians , as well as parthians , scythians , alans , etc. 
  from antiquity . 
  you are correct in that there are non-iranian people 's living in iran ( such as the various turkic peoples , arabs , etc ) who would be iranian by nationality but not iranian by ethnicity ( or race but the concept of an aryan race is ebbing into pseudoscience and is difficult to prove ) . 
  in any case , no one should be confusing skin color with race with ethnicity because there 's no clear distinction between these artificial groups of people and skin color is a bullshit way of classifying someone ethnically anyway . 
  there are genetically closely related groups of people out there who do n't look all that alike due to a number of subtle reasons ; who gets to decide who is part of one race and who is n't on this spectrum ? 
  but his ideology was n't `` imported '' at all ? 
  no it 's not . 
  it is possible for something to be bad for everyone . 
  the usa and uk have certainly dropped the ball on dealing the repercussions of destabilizing the region . 
  so has russia for continuing to perpetuate the war with their unwavering support of their pet dictator due to their regional interests . 
  that being said , germany and sweden do n't `` have '' to take care of this at all . 
  they volunteered for it . 
  i 've unfortunately spent an inordinate amount of time in that country . 
  there 's really nothing redeeming about it . 
  the climate is a hot desert hellhole . 
  there 's nothing of interest culturally other than the historical islamic sites , which non-muslims are n't allowed to visit anyway . 
  very few pre-islamic historical sites left if any , have to go to yemen if want to see sabean ruins . 
  in any case , anything remotely interesting about the arab culture , like the tea , textiles , etc. 
  can be experienced in one of the other less oppressive gulf countries , like bahrain or kuwait , or north in lebanon or jordan . 
  if you want to have rich desert fun ( and actually want to drink ) you can go to the uae . 
  saudi cuisine is some of the least appealing of any country in the muslim world - terribly bland . 
  it 's totally unremarkable . 
  when was the last time you saw a saudi themed restaurant , anywhere ? 
  the kingdom just fucking sucks unless you 're a muslim and even then it sucks for most muslims who are n't rich native gulf arabs . 
  you 're a second class human if you 're not arab and even discriminated against even if you 're an arab from outside the gulf . 
  the amount of influence that awful country has in modern geopolitics is one of life 's great injustices . 
  it 's funny how it 's mostly the germans getting downvoted in here in a topic about german domestic policy . 
  you guys need to get it through your heads that these british and american redditors know what 's best for your country . 
  because clearly that 's not your responsibility . 
  sounds like the louvre will be at least 15 % more bearable then . 
  what do you want them to do ? 
  grab their rifles and go on a witch hunt ? 
  the european parliament has no control over individual states ' domestic security policies . 
  never said it would be easy or that i agreed with them . 
  exactly , al-qaeda has been underground for decades , and how isis has already perpetrated many more civilian attacks than aq ever did . 
  aq also had true political aims ( expulsion of the west from the me ) . 
  aq also worked solely through its own operatives and never claimed to be the leaders of muslims everywhere . 
  the real danger of isis is that still serves as an inspiration and call to every discouraged muslim around the world perpetrate attacks , regardless of the target and reason . 
  they do n't even need to be involved with them - if an attacker claims they were inspired by isis , that 's all they need to consider it a success . 
  right now they look and feel like an authority figure because they are established . 
  cut them off , let them go underground , and they stop seeming like a `` caliphate '' that people can look up to and just become another terrorist group . 
  there 's a lot of power in the word caliphate . 
  people do n't want to be terrorists , which is what they are if they join al qaeda , etc. 
  they want to be soldiers of god and servants of the caliph and all that other nonsense . 
  remove their establishment and it will go a long way towards removing their authority . 
  this wo n't stop unless isis is fully eradicated , meaning a full scale invasion by western ( or russian ) forces . 
  shout all you want about immigrants but as long as this shitty caliphate exists , it will serve as a figurehead for every would be jihadist imbecile . 
  nothing short of a total capture of raqqah , the elimination of the leadership and occupation of all currently isis held lands will stop this . 
  if he even was muslim he would have been shia rather than sunni . 
  gives credence to hating and attacking sunni turks ( who he claims bullied him ) and the germans he feels betrayed him by letting them in . 
  one motive.again , if he were muslim . 
  i feel like you 're also just lumping in all forms of shia and sunni extremism into one `` islamic terrorism '' which is really ignorant . 
  shias are much less likely to go on a jihadi inspired rampage than sunnis . 
  even hezbollah has n't done that to israel , preferring more conventional warfare in the form of rocket attacks and targeted bombings ( suicide bombings in cafes and the like are from sunni groups such as hamas ) . 
  shias also take scripture and doctrine much less fanatically which is partly the reason hardcore sunnis think they are heretics . 
  as bad as iran may be portrayed , even iran has much greater freedom than saudi arabia . 
  honestly i ca n't even recall the last terror attack perpetrated on the west in the name of shia extremism . 
  lots of racist iranians can claim to be part of the `` white race '' as true aryans or what not , though . 
  a definition which turks or arabs would not fit . 
  weirdly enough , iranians obsessed with purity could in theory fit white supremacist ideology . 
  come on man , it 's not the us and uk 's fault for starting it , it 's 100 % the eu 's for not `` dealing '' with it . 
  jeez . 
  you realize `` bombing the fuck out of the middle east '' is the reason shit is as bad as it is now , right ? 
  so was invading . 
  so what bright idea do you think this fuckstick has for `` going in and dealing with this '' ? 
  for real though buddhists can be violent too , just check out burma these days , pick another religion next time for that hawt karma . 
  amish are a safe bet, 
  there are lots of afghans in pakistan . 
  look at a map , they 're right next to each other . 
  they are one of the biggest ethnic groups .

this is the most recent event , but the one detaching it from the american meaning of `` socialist '' is tours , if not earlier . 
  because it is not a marxist-leninist party , and has fully embraced the republican-democratic form of government since at least the 1920 tours congress ( and thus could have been called a social-democratic party since back then ) . 
  ( this was probably true even earlier , the sfio having always been as attached to political liberty as to economic equality ; but the modern socialists are the direct heirs of those who said a direct non to stalin in 1920 , at the cost of being in opposition for quite some years ) . 
  well i was looking for documentation on this important topic and i found that indeed putin seems so have [ learnt a few tricks from silvio 's book ] ( http://imgur.com/snnl7mn ) . 
  ( sadly , i have been unable to find the same documentation on erdo\u011fan ) . 
  * edit : i found that erdo\u011fan also seems to like [ hot babes ] ( http://imgur.com/za75zjh ) . 
  i thought that to be fucking silvio berlusconi , you had to be a female , and preferably minor ? 
  / gets out, 
  whoa , that straw man is well burnt now , you may stop my friend . 
   that 's a dangerous punishment . 
  the us considers it unconstitutional . 
  it is forbidden , in most cases , by international treaties ( big ones , like the human rights convention ) . 
  thankfully . 
  but we are going to do it anyway . 
  yes , the french * socialists * are going to make a law for citizenship removal . 
  what a sad day . 
  yes , this is a good reason why freedom of speech * for people i like * should be absolute , to be able to call for removing freedom of speech * for people i hate * . 
  - eu - san marino , because it 's cute ( i do n't know anything else about san marino , just wanted to be the first one to quote them ) - east germany , because it still exists , although [ relocated in a warmer place ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ernst_th%c3%a4lmann_island ) and now quite inoffensive . 
  - iceland ( never been there ) , because is it a european country ? 
  ( ok , that 's not a unique property , but the other contenders were not as nice : turkey , armenia , georgia , russia , greenland , uk ) . 
   and most of the land of current day israel was already owned by the israel foundation . 
  lie . 
  the jewish fund owned only about 1000 km ^ 2 of land , plus about as much privately owned , for a total of about 10 % of the land . 
  -  * busted * [ source ( pro-palestinian website which i mistook it for the jnf itself ) ] ( http://www.thejerusalemfund.org/ht/d/contentdetails/i/2963 ) . 
  so , let us see what happened there a few years ago : refugees from a conflict zone migrated here , established local superiority and confiscated the land . 
  it 's funny how some people hate the refugees when they are brown people ( syrians , afghans etc , ) , support them when they are white people ( germans , poles , etc. 
  ) , yet are not , really not , racist ? 
  and of course the state of the palestinian territories is totally independent from any israeli meddling . 
  this used to be the case also in france ( pr\u00e9sident du conseil , also * informally * prime minister ) until de gaulle in 1958 , where that made one president too many ( pr\u00e9sident de la r\u00e9publique + pr\u00e9sident du conseil is about 1.5 pr\u00e9sident too many for a semi-presidential republic , i hope you follow ) , and the pr\u00e9sident du conseil was retrograded to a mere prime minister . 
  ( fun fact : the pr\u00e9sident du conseil was in the third republic one of the ministers , who assumed the presidency as an extra charge . 
  i do n't know about the fourth republic , but i believe by then he was a `` ministre sans portefeuille '' ) . 
  ( filo pastry filled with feta cheese ) . 
  ( seriously answering a probable joke ) - there is no death penalty in france ( and it will not come back even with terror attacks ) - 124 people * charged * , not proven guilty ( and it is quite probable that the police would have swept very wide , so there are likely a few innocents in the batch ) . 
  the media are actually very much restrained this time - they learnt a bit after the charlie hebdo attacks , where the `` live news '' channels did - publish the name + photo of a suspect before the official police search warrant , - film the police encircling the hostage site ( and the hostage-taker was watching this channel , thus knew where the police was ) , - in the same hostage situation , call and do a live interview with the hostage taker , - and my favourite : during the last stand of the kouachi brothers , they disclosed on tv the presence of a guy hiding in the same building . 
  ( luckily , those two were * not * watching tv and the guy escaped ) . 
  still , you often see persons of east asian ancestry wearing a mask ( looking like a surgical mask ) . 
  this is probably illegal under the niqab law , but strangely people do n't care . 
  ( also , wearing this is actually * very polite * from them , since they do it when they have a cold , to prevent it from spreading ) . 
   i think the swiss burqa-wearing women will be fine . 
  * fined * ftfy ( also , are they swiss , or tourists ? 
  in paris they often say that niqab 'd women are the wives of saudi turist emirs ) . 
   if people want a pornographic community there are plenty of them out there . 
  [ ( or so i heard ) ] ( http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/main/orsoiheard ) < -- risky click of the day , but it 's safe , go ahead, 
  i am old enough to remember when facebook did not exist . 
  ( yes i am ) . 
  i do n't think that the fact that back then , people were not posting calls to violence on facebook , caused them to actually be more violent . 
  where ( and when , if possible ) did this take place ? 
  and most interestingly , even with such loaded questions and all , the figure for muslims is not significantly different from the same figure for non-muslims : the sun ends up shooting their own propaganda in the foot ... 
  on the contrary , the number of [ russian tourists ] ( https://aco.nato.int/new-satellite-imagery-exposes-russian-combat-troops-inside-ukraine ) in turkey will * massively increase * now . 
  thanks for the links !, 
  niqab being about freedom of expression seems to me a basic right ( general rule : freedom of expression is also supposed to apply to things i dislike , which happen to include the niqab ) . 
  the links you posted however are more about the right to choose than the niqab itself ( again , the right to self-determination is also supposed to work for stuff we do n't like ) . 
  only [ 1 to 4 % of our genes at most ] ( http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2010/05/100506-science-neanderthals-humans-mated-interbred-dna-gene/ ) are inherited from the first europeans . 
  my point here is not really about the neanderthalians ^ ( please eta , note that i did * not * write that the basque are neanderthalians ) , but about the fact that 1 . if we exclude them , then we more-or-less need to define `` first europeans '' as `` first europeans who left a majority of our genome '' , in which case the fact that we did inherit a majority of our genome from them is a tautology , and 2 . the `` first europeans '' question , whether cultural or genetic ( and both cultures and genomes * do * evolve !, 
  ) , is really pointless , since an answer as obviously absurd as `` neanderthalians '' ^ ( or basque ) is technically correct !, 
  then why put the word `` millions '' in there , if not to provoke such a shortcut ? 
   the problem is that there 's a significant segment of the left who 've subscribed to moral relativism so hard they 're defending the niqab as `` female empowerment '' . 
  do you have any source to quote in support of this ? 
  please . 
  rest assured that everybody understood what orban really meant : he does not like brown people . 
  actually , the only candidates for `` true europeans '' are the basque , and even then that 's a flimsy case at most . 
  still , raf , whether funded by ussr or not , is a perfect counter-example of terrorists who are not migrants , thus exposing orban 's lie . 
  apparently , terrorists are supposed to be ~ ~ brown people ~ ~ ( wait , we call them `` muslims '' now , to pretend not being racists ) . 
  note that this also excludes eta , flnc , italian mafia , etc. 
   you can get a rather nice , armored used audi for around 40k eur but be quick to choose . 
  price is expected to go up a bit now . 
  well , the syrian free army confirmed yesterday that there had been so far * no civilian casualties * from the french bombing campaign , so apparently they have been putting a bit more thought on it this time . 
  that picture is definitely not the basilica . 
  the address of the assault ( which i heard on radio this morning ) is about 500 m from the basilica . 
   the majority of the population has `` sans-papiers '' status - meaning they do not yet have a legal status and an id which would allow them to find a job . 
  this is a very bizarre claim . 
  [ citation needed ] !, 
  i was a bit puzzled by your comment and then understood that you probably meant `` policemen or policewomen '' ( and then i wonder if there are any in raid ? 
  well , he certainly did not built the infrastructure himself , and there is a serious point to be made that he mostly used the existing infrastructure ( which was great in germany , and untouched by ww1 ) - cf for example shirer 's * rise and fall of the third reich * . 
  i see this discussion occuring once in a while and i wonder what is so difficult for synchronized attacks ? 
  - you look at the program of stade de france and bataclan to see on which days there are both a match here and a concert there , - maybe you obtain a map of the attack sites ? 
  - the hardest part : you buy some weapons and explosives , - you synchronize your watches , - apparently no need to plan an escape route ( this really would be very hard ) . 
  this looks like something that a few guys with access to basement + pen + paper + innocuous internet searches would be able to do in a few evenings . 
  hey , they can even claim table-top rpgs as an excuse for this !, 
  came here to post this , posted it , then saw that you already did . 
  take my upvote !, 
  also , legalizing ( or at least depenalizing ) drugs should empty a bit the prisons , making them less of a jihad-school , and making it easier to watch carefully the detainees . 
  as trollish as this could be , i think that depenalizing marijuana could be a very great step against this kind of terrorists : - most importantly , it cuts a source of funds ( and hence weapons ) ; - it also empties ( a bit ) the prisons , making it easier to watch carefully those persons held inside ( who would now be the really dangerous ones ) . 
  you are perfectly right !, 
  writing in english in the morning sometimes confuses me ... 
  well , `` near saint-denis '' and `` in saint-denis '' are two very different places . 
  moreover , the surrounding district , somewhat confusingly called `` seine saint-denis '' , is not ( on average ) the most pleasant of places . 
  if you dressed like an amerindian to spill your tea , then yes , it is undoubtedly america 's fault . 
  username checks . 
  it is really easy to access from downtown paris and has the funeral basilica of the kings of france ( none of which are actually still buried there since the r\u00e9volution - maybe louis xviii ? 
  ) , but the crypt still holds all the statues ( making this a very rare example where you can see the various styles as they were made , not collected in a museum ) . 
  and the basilica itself is very nice ( it is one of the very first gothic churches , you can also see the progression of style between the oldest and newest parts of the nave ) . 
  the city around it , while containing nothing else `` touristy '' ( maybe stade de france ? 
  ) , is a quite nice place ( i used to work here ) that feels like an actual downtown and not a gloomy suburb like we have so many of . 
  one of the last times i visited the city , there was a marriage in the basilica . 
  both the bride and groom were obviously afro-french ( is that a word ? ), 
  and the priest had the thickest vietnamese accent i ever heard . 
  seeing this marriage taking place right above the kings of france was glorious :-), 
  ( now this is much better than a stupid comparison , thanks !, 
  i dream of a sub where we would upvote `` this is an actual idea , even if i disagree with it '' and downvote `` this is a lame analogy , even if i agree with it '' , but / r/europe is no such sub ) .

  in spite of , you know , [ facts ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/sep/06/debt-crisis-mario-draghi ) . 
  because populism . 
  we have [ baron noir ] ( http://www.monteursassocies.com/wp-content/uploads/baron_noir_affiche.jpg ) which is about a politician from dunkirk and his machinations . 
  in general it 's made to be extremely realistic and inspired by real events . 
  season 1 had tons of inspiration from hollande 's election , there 's a season 2 coming , as well . 
  marseille is so bad it 's good . 
  nothing new actually , i do n't understand people who are disappointed . 
  it 's standard us policy , obama was the exception . 
  [ ` muricans gon na ` murica ] ( https://youtu.be/xmrmtvogbpk ), 
  he does tend to be overrated a bit , and has a tendency to just disappear in big games , which is why so many people call him a flat-track bully . 
  i 'm fairly certain europeans are way more into bdsm than anywhere else . 
  `` fuck '' - the really hot one . 
  so italy . 
  `` marry '' - the good stable one . 
  so germany . 
  `` kill '' - ca n't say the uk since that would include our scot bros. 
  i 'll just say portugal because of euro 2016 salt . 
  when i went to the us , it happened pretty often . 
  i had to repress the urge to tell them `` do we know each other ? '', 
  and `` mind your own business '' . 
  we 're waiting in a line , not hanging out in a caf\u00e9 ... 
  from our constitution :  any man persecuted in virtue of his actions in favour of liberty may claim the right of asylum upon the territories of the republic . 
  so yes . 
  ... i am , actually ... 
  also tolkien 's inspiration for the tale of the children of hurin !, 
  well , technically , king arthur as well . 
  however there 's also count roland , a paladin in charlemagne 's court . 
  the song of roland is the first real french literature and it 's an epic poem about how roland fights alone against like a million saracens by himself somewhere in the pyrenees , blowing his war-horn to warn charlemagne ( yes , this is where boromir comes from ) . 
  it 's semi-mythical because even if we do know that there was a roland ( more accurately hrolandt ) , he probably died in an ambush by basque mountain-dwellers and that 's about it . 
  another foundation myth is that the kings of france descend from the trojans . 
  the legend goes that francion , prince of troy , escaped the sack of the city with aeneus ( who according to virgil then sort of was at the origin of rome ) and established his kingdom beyond the rhine . 
  thus creating the frankish realm . 
  they say that charlemagne 's sword was actually the sword of hector of troy as well . 
  yeah , the makeup that looks like there 's no makeup is pretty big . 
   very common , but much more common to see young women here in barcelona wearing little or no make up at all than it is in the uk , where i think it 's more culturally `` required '' . 
   what he 's saying is that spanish women are so pretty they do n't need makeup . 
  the ascent of supreme warlord macron . 
  i voted macron in both rounds . 
  obviously , i 'm very happy , and hopeful . 
  * regarding european affairs , i hope macron will be able to bring in his enthusiastic and ambitious ideas for europe , and bring a closer relationship to all our european neighbours . 
  * more than that , i hope he 'll do what hollande did n't and actually stand for something . 
  hollande just seemed ... absent on the european stage . 
  that the french president was nearly silent for the refugee crisis is mindblowing . 
  europe is built on the franco-german axis and if that 's out of balance , it does n't work as well . 
  * regarding interior affairs , i voted for him because he wants to reform a lot of our existing system to make it work better and in a modernised way . 
  whereas the right wing just wants to destroy the whole thing - fillon 's programme was one of the most regressive ever and if i 'm honest i was more scared of him than of le pen . 
  some of his key reforms , such as a comprehensive overhaul of the unemployments benefits system , a transition of funding social security through `` normal '' taxes instead of payroll taxes are the ones i 'm looking out for . 
  * finally , he does seem to want to sweep up all of french politics . 
  already he 's stated his government would n't be only career politicians . 
  and the rules he set up for the selection of candidates in legislative elections will be a big shake-up : 50 % of `` new '' people who are n't politicians , 50 % of women . 
  plus proposals on eliminating corruption , and limiting the number of mandates a politician can have . 
  it 's going to shake up all our tired political establishment , made up of people who were in national office since way before i was born . 
  so yes , i 'm hopeful . 
  i was n't in 2012 , because having followed socialist politics for a long time , i knew ( like a lot of others ) that hollande would be a failure . 
  but this is the other thing - this is the last shot we have . 
  if macron fucks up then there * will * be an fn presidency in 5 years . 
  that 's my feeling right now . 
  hopeful , but really , manu , * do n't fuck this up * . 
  really ? 
  i thought it was in the `` so bad it 's good '' category ... 
  ... fuck i forgot a lot of them . 
  though with d\u00e9sir\u00e9 , innocent and fortun\u00e9 you went full colonialism there !,

  ~ ~ do n't all names mean something , just that we 've forgotten the etymology ? ~ ~ did n't see ops edit !, 
  pierre ( stone ) is the most common one i can think of , there are much rarer names as well like victoire ( victory ) , fleur ( flower ) , ange ( angel ) , auguste ( august ) , florentin ( florentine ) ... 
  i 'm bored at my office , can you at least let me pretend i 'm 16 again ? 
  there are a few here and there . 
  filthy iphone normies are still pretty common but still a majority of people are in the android master race . 
  first time i had any alcohol it was probably at 9 or 10 , trying out wine at the family lunch . 
  first time real drinking probably at 14 . 
  first time really drunk at 16 . 
  one thing we should remember in terms of how republicans work is the disconnect between public image and reality of practice . 
  if the republicans * really * acted as idiotic as they look , the world should have collapsed into world war iii in dubya 's time . 
  but in reality , republicans , are also playing a political game like the others ( even though from my point of view , even the most moderate republican is a crazed theocrat ) . 
  so yeah , they do n't compare to the nazis , stalinists , or even some of the anarchists . 
  i 'd also point out to op that the medieval church was n't damaging to europe , at all . 
  it is a swear word so not to be used in front of everyone . 
  otherwise , it 's very adaptable , and works everywhere . 
  see [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/france/comments/51f1lx/french_exclamations_a_beginners_guide/ ) technically `` putain '' means `` whore '' , so sometimes you 'll see it as a noun ( * une putain * ) which is a sort of elegantly trashy way of saying whore . 
  merde is for everyday use . 
  then you have * bordel de merde * or * putain de merde * . 
  then you have * putain de bordel de merde * . 
  then it 's time to get creative . 
  the `` blasphemous '' stuff like * nom de dieu !, 
  bon sang !, 
  * are incredibly tame , so much so that nobody 'd use the except in irony . 
  in any case , * putain * , * bordel * and * merde * have got you covered for every need . 
  the mockery part is one of the biggest cultural differences there is and is incredibly misunderstood . 
  i do n't think any of my foreign friends ever found pierre desproges funny , most french people find him hysterical . 
  even les inconnus has a bit of that vicious form of humour . 
  to say nothing of les guignols de l'info which mixed our love of politics with this form of humour . 
  americans especially do n't get it at all , i feel , many of those i know feel it 's mean-spirited . 
  then again , we do n't really get their humour either ... i ca n't think of a single american comedy that made me laugh , weirdly . 
  but we love english humour !, 
  the other thing people do n't know is the most ruthless target of mockery is ourselves but only when there are no foreigners around . 
  i 'll also add a specific type that revolves around playing around with the language and being creative with it , slang and such . 
  kaamelott has a lot of this . 
  it 's already a sort of macron - m\u00e9lenchon war though . 
  now that fillon 's dead , there 's no longer a common enemy everyone hates . 
  yeah .

  analysts have several times proclaimed that resources will soon run out , only to have the claim refuted by better drilling techniques the fact that the ressource curse got it 's deadline pushed back several times does not mean they should n't address the problem before it explodes in their face . 
   denmark spends what it gets denmark spends what it needs to spend actually . 
  and they use the oil & gaz to get the funds needed to make that a reality . 
  but when the hydrocarbure wo n't be an option , they 'll need a plan b. 
  and actually enforcing their tax rules seems like a decent plan b to me since nobody else came up with anything apart `` going full greece and stopping paying pensions and healthcare and unemployment and civil servants '' as far as i know . 
  which would , likely , have been a bad thing for society . 
   this fall brings a political negotiation of tax reforms to be fully implemented by 2025 . 
  exactly . 
   i think it more likely denmark will reduce its current official corporate from 22 % to 20 % because that is what sweden has that 's possible actually . 
  but it might then be largely compensated by the very fact they might actually collect those 20 % . 
  instead of collecting 0 % of - on-paper-22 % . 
   an image i picture , when someone claims large companies being `` forced '' to pay a fair tax , depicts a mouse ass raping an elephant while screaming take that and that and that is a very ... colorfull image . 
  and one that might not quite fit reality . 
  while i certainly do not enjoy the idea of a governmental fight with corporations , and i 'm certainly quite aware of the stigma attached to forced nationalization of assets ( which can be quite extreme , and in multiple case abused and led to the destruction of country doing just that ) ; it will pretty much end up with the eu having to choose between starting to collect owed taxes or having a 30 % budget shortfall . 
  and bruxelles might be a bit bigger and stronger than a mouse . 
  what with having the biggest combined gdp on earth ( 15 % bigger than the usa ) . 
   this will mean international companies can oppose individual countries legislation as unfair business practice . 
  the isds ? 
  lol , that one is not likely to pass . 
  there 's at least 4 ( 6 ? ), 
  eu countries very opposed to it . 
   i have little faith that the multinationals will lose that battle . 
  which in no way mean it is acceptable to tolerate barely disguised fraud renamed `` avoidance '' . 
  edit : and since the eu 's economic survival likely depend in huge part on collecting taxes on corporation , i 'm afraid we might have to be pretty aggressive in defending our capacity to collect those . 
  the most uncooperative corporations ( nestle , mcdonalds ? ), 
  might face serious judicial action . 
   never going to happen . 
  there 's going to be a dose of reality that 's going to happen pretty soon here i suspect . 
   firstly usa has no right to that profit , you 're talking on / r/europe , europe which , as nestle might rediscover soon , is not ran by us law . 
   tax laws are so complex , that a country needs the most intelligent and experienced accountants to tell them how to make the laws when a company like nestle openly answer that they wo n't pay taxes ordered by a judge because they do n't feel like it ( like that case you quoted earlier ) , the answer wo n't be byzantine accounting , it 'll be sending policemen to for equal missing value ( and if that goes as far as a factory , then so be it . 
   nestle made an accounting mistake in 2013 `` a mistake '' . 
  yeah right , like when hsbc got caught funding al zarqawi ? 
   the reason they were so surprised was that they do not have the resources to actually control the international companies accounting books you are right there . 
  mafias and cartel-scale fraud are always pretty hard to crack down upon . 
   corruption is a violation of the criminal law . 
  you are playing on words to hide your dishonesty again . 
  corruption covers wilfully misleading the system for your personnal profit . 
  for example , in the usa de facto offering millions of bribe money to politicians is perfectly legal when you call it a `` campaign contribution '' . 
  that does not mean it is not corruption in reality . 
   the local tax man can only shrug and say thanks when he gets anything at all . 
  corporations are not entitled to decide what the state can or not collect and/or to play by the law or not . 
  methinks there should be some very serious fiscal corrections right there , and likely quite a number of asset seizures by police forces and bank accounts freezes and likely arrests by interpol to underline the point . 
   it does n't matter if it 's tax on corporate income or on personal income . 
  yes it does , because if you do n't tax corporate and everything is declared corporate , then you de facto tax basically nothing . 
  they just declare their income in bermuda ( a money laundery fiscal place ) and you do n't collect anything . 
  that 's what 's currently happening note , and why we are loosing hundreds of billions a year of tax money . 
   and none country budget is not build in 3/4 out of companies income tax . 
  yet the nordics do . 
   the main sources are vat and income taxes . 
  it would be if most people had sufficient income for that . 
  but with wages crashing and companies stashing everything , that 's not viable anymore since basically reagan , because most of the money never pass by the vat and incomes declared in eu countries . 
   the more you have , the harder it gets to claim it . 
  only because we tolerated rampant corruption for too long so companies used the opportunity to invent perpetually new creative ways to `` avoid '' taxes . 
  if we started jailing executives on `` avoidance procedures '' , you can bet that `` avoidance rate '' would fall like a rock . 
   they managed to show a small loss or no income profit for decades . 
  which we all know was an accounting trick , nestle being de facto one of the richest companies on earth and one of the most profitables by very far . 
   nestle the huge business mogul was so bad at finances the ice cream company failed to deliver a profit the next year . 
  i would n't put it past their accounting to have buy the company just to declare a supposed loss . 
  mcdonalds was caught in finland doing just that ( buying failed restaurants at a loss to declare a fictive loss and fraud taxes ) . 
   it is perfectly legal , and even if the entire tax structure was changed , there are plenty of other ways to avoid the tax man . 
  it is an open bug abuse of the code 's wording with the open intent to surbvert it 's functionement . 
  it should be treated as fraud and certainly not tolerated . 
  allowing such massive corporate abuse destroyed the economy of quite a number of country . 
  i do not want the rest of europe to end like greece where most forms of graft were perfectly legal and yet destroyed the country nontheless . 
  i do not see as acceptable that massive percentages of the country end up homeless and starving just so that a few fabulously wealthy billionaires can stop paying taxes . 
  unless you feel we should imitate africa of course / s, 
  corporate taxes is likely the majority of taxes by far . 
  stopping collecting them is like abolishing 3/4 of the state budget . 
  it is simply not viable without them , and the burden would then automatically fall only on people too poor to declare a corporate shell company . 
  this is open hypocrisy . 
  yes that 's what he wrote . 
  word for word : `` not enforcing company taxation is the better choice . '', 
  now unless i do n't speak the same english , that pretty much implies they wo n't be paid . 
  and possibly because , while i suspect he fully knows they are needed , he likely does n't care about his country and would rather steal/pocket that tax money . 
  well the whole point is that he does n't want taxes collected . 
  so what they going to spend then ? 
  european states run on taxes due to our more or less ressourceless economies . 
  if you do n't collect them , the european state in question do n't run . 
   not enforcing company taxation is the better choice . 
  in an occidental country , no company or anybody paying any taxes is how you end up like greece or spain .

  also amnesty : https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2016/08/australia-reaction-to-the-guardian-s-damning-nauru-files-on-refugee-abuse/, 
   both prisons and hospitals are often built by the same construction firms that 's a shitty excuse if i ever heard one . 
  most countries do n't use ex cia prisons to `` house '' their refugees . 
   make the condition to harsh and they fly away . 
  that sound like the usual excuse to allow corporate fraud `` otherwise they will delocalize '' . 
  well no . 
  you 're probably right honestly , good points, 
   those ngos will need to be funded by industrialised countries though . 
  yeah but they have a lot of alternative funding too that help spread the bill  europe is 20 % of global gdp . 
  ~ ~ ^ not ^ my ^ fault ^ if ^ everyone ^ else ^ is ^ bad ^ :-d ~ ~ j/k  however hosting people outside europe should be a lot cheaper in the first place . 
  well since the turkey deal is having issues maybe we can keep shopping in morrocco, 
  should n't the trust pay crippling corporate taxes to discourage such blatant evasion of taxes ? 
  but do n't worry somehow they 'll find a way to blame the poles for it / s, 
   holding camps in the specific countries , protected by an armed police force/european border force and with a strict screening and selection process is a solution . 
  that might look a solution . 
  and offloading a noticable part of the work to the red cross and other ngo ( with a contract ) would ensure that both 1 \u00b0 ) fair treatment is happening ( there would be lots of witnesses ) 2 \u00b0 ) we do n't have to pay the full bill or run * everything * since the ngo can do it partly for us, 
  a more reasonably stance . 
  of what ? 
  the torture ?

  people know what they need better than governments/charities , cash transfers are more efficient . 
  fyi [ there have been experiments already ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/basic_income_guarantee#pilot_programmes ) , but this would be the first in europe afaik .

  pc = politically correct ? 
   it 's a tough problem as long as there 's a first world and a third world why are you using terms that do n't make sense instead of simply saying something like `` as long as there is poverty in the world '' ? 
  agreed . 
  i used to think it was weird to view drug legalization as important , but then i realized it would reduce criminality and increase tax revenue . 
   this article articulates an american perspective . 
  does it ? 
  i 'm pretty sure there are a lot of europeans who disapprove of laws that impede freedom of speech . 
   would increase exponentially as you own more apartments . 
  this kind of scheme does n't work very well , you only need to have different legal owners ( other family members , shell companies ) to avoid the higher tax rate . 
  how about we never hang people ? 
  there is nothing stopping the ecb from breaking the rules , yet it does n't break them , so the logical conclusion is that it does n't want to . 
  of course the ecb could break the rules , but it does n't want to . 
   furthermore , why the no-risk guarantee ? 
  that is equivalent underwriting the loans themselves , which the ecb does not do . 
  why not ? 
  because it 's prohibited from directly loaning money to countries like greece . 
  only people who do n't receive a good share of the newly printed money get `` poorer '' . 
   the only way is to have everyone understand at least one common language it 's not the only imaginable way , if automated translation ever becomes good enough the problem would disappear , and not just in europe but everywhere else too . 
  the ecb 's mandate is to keep inflation steady , giving money to citizens is one possible option to boost inflation when it 's too low . 
   how would you give it out ? 
  same amount for everyone , directly into people 's bank accounts . 
   they ca n't . 
  the ecb ca n't finance states or other public institutions , but it could probably give a little money directly to the citizens of the eurozone ( friedman 's `` helicopter money '' ) . 
   here 's a link to lots of academic articles on the matter . 
  you 're missing the point . 
  afaik all those papers assume a debt-based monetary system . 
  that makes them irrelevant unless it can be demonstrated that the underlying monetary system has no significant impact . 
   monetary union without fiscal union wo n't work . 
  i have yet to see a demonstration of that . 
  it could very well be that the heart of the problem is the debt-based monetary system and that a `` fiscal union '' is merely a way of compensating for that systemic flaw instead of fixing it . 
  the fact that the crisis originally started in the usa seems to support the idea that a fiscal union is only a `` recovery '' mechanism , not something that prevents crises . 
  if you 've been following the latest events you should know by now that the matter is political , not economical . 
  politicians are concerned about their electorates ' reactions , they 're not worried about the financial markets in this case . 
  that 's another misleading wording . 
  it 's not a `` transfer '' as in `` i send you something i have and thus i wo n't have it anymore '' . 
  it 's an esm loan as in `` we borrow money from the financial markets for you , you pay it back '' . 
  the cost for the countries behind the esm is very small as long as greece does n't default . 
  greece falling out of the euro could also strengthen euroskeptic parties everywhere ( `` see , we told you the euro would n't work , we were right '' ) , so it 's not necessarily a better scenario . 
   p.s you owe greece another $ 1 billion by tuesday it 's the opposite , it 's greece who would owe the others money . 
  you make it sound like they 're gifts instead of loans . 
   welfare provides nowhere near the amount of money , with the same amount of ease a `` basic income '' would . 
  we do n't know what the amount of a basic income would be , it depends on how generous people want it to be , it could very well start at an amount similar to current welfare . 
   why would they ? 
  it 's not because they are lazy ... 
  i would n't either ... let me get this straight : if you received a bi you would n't work at all ? 
  you would have no desire to earn more money ? 
  you do n't want to be useful to society ? 
  in my experience when you ask people what they would do if they had a bi , they usually do n't answer `` i 'd sit back and do nothing for the rest of my life '' . 
   if i heard an intelligible refutation of property rights , i would accept it . 
  i 'm not trying to refute the right to private property , the lockean proviso merely spells out one of its limits . 
  property is one of the basic human rights , but it 's no more absolute than the others . 
   but where do they initially get the money to invest in this fund ? 
  wherever , the point is that you do n't necessarily need taxation , so even if you consider taxation to be theft you ca n't say that bi is inherently stealing . 
   no one does those jobs for any reason than pure sustenance if that were true those jobs would have already disappeared in my country , because even though we do n't have a real basic income you can survive on welfare without working . 
  people on welfare still seek work , because it only covers their basic needs and they want extra money , because they want to be useful to society , etc. 
   you need to provide reasoning as to why it 's okay to take other peoples money . 
  i already have , you went on about ethics instead of answering . 
  earth is the common property of everyone who lives on it , and everyone is entitled to a share of its riches . 
  the right to private property can not be used to justify leaving other people with nothing , that 's the [ lockean proviso ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lockean_proviso ) . 
   tax is taking money by force i could answer that , but given what you 've said i do n't think we 'll get anywhere , so instead i 'll point out that bi can be funded through other means than taxation . 
  for example a country can set up a sovereign investment fund that distributes its profits as a bi . 
  you 're twisting my words in ridiculous ways , i have no prejudice against poor people . 
   ubi supporters need to address this issue somehow . 
  it 's a non-issue , you do n't need to threaten people 's survival to get them to work , they 'll do it because they want to , or because it increases their income . 
   what you 've said is generally ignored by the philosophical community as `` naive moral relativism '' . 
  that 's not something i 'm familiar with . 
  let 's go back to that instead :  you should n't be able to steal money by force from people who have earned it themselves . 
  were you implying that bi is stealing ? 
  that taxation is theft ? 
   a tax on rent is a tax on labor . 
  the landlord 's labor is marginal , it 's not the source of the value . 
  legally , rent income is n't considered as labor income . 
   as for profits and sales , well you are n't making a profit or selling things without labor there can be very little paid labor involved in producing and selling some things that have a lot of value nonetheless . 
  in other words , something 's value is n't proportional to the amount of paid labor that went into making it . 
   if you have your needs met you wo n't work as hard , do n't see any way around it . 
  survival is a poor motivator , it pushes you to do anything necessary , but that includes things that do n't really benefit society ( bullshit jobs , crime ) , and it also does n't motivate you to do things properly . 
  there are better motivators : being useful , feeling appreciated , having fun , earning extra money , etc. 
   also ethics . 
  ethics are subjective , maybe you consider basic income unethical , i consider the lack of it to be unethical . 
  some people argue that the lack of bi is a violation of human rights , and i completely agree . 
  earth is the common property of everyone who lives on it , and everyone is entitled to a share of its riches . 
   if you got 15k a year for free , would you really bust your ass 40 hours a week to make 20 ? 
  that 's not how basic income works . 
  if you find a job that pays 20k then you have 35k total , because you still receive your 15k basic income . 
  ( those are weird example numbers , are they supposed to be euros ? ), 
  i only know of a detailed study for my own country , france . 
  the main funding mechanism is a flat income tax ( all kinds of income , not just labor ) . 
  political viability is another matter . 
  if we ca n't get citizens to understand that the tax hike is n't so bad because the money goes straight back into their pockets , then the solution is to start by implementing a negative income tax instead of a real basic income . 
  the effect on the incomes of citizens is the same , but psychologically a nit looks cheaper and is thus easier to get approval for . 
  rents , profits , consumption/sales , etc. 
  when you pay for things it 's not all labor . 
  it 's not good to put all your eggs in one basket , vat alone can not provide stable funding for a basic income . 
  even if some people were to work fewer hours without other people filling in , wages are not the only source of tax revenue . 
  if the tax system is properly designed a small decrease in work hours should n't pose any problem . 
  they already have , through the imf . 
   that does n't mean i like it and i would genuinely enjoy it if someone came up with a system that kept investment and commerce banks from fucking shit up other monetary systems do exist .

  that 's all . 
  i 'm a woman as well ... 
  there is no fart joke in the live action , i bet you never watch the movie ... no , in fact , i 'm sure you never watch it but just spited on it because it 's a french movie . 
  it 's pathetic . 
  sincerely . 
  when i was in london , everytime i met a french family ( and there was a lot , especially near oxford street ) , there was the mom who was draging her child while he was screaming . 
  and obviously , the father was complaining near them . 
  complaining about the crowd , the weather etc. . . just by his face , you can guess he was frustrated . 
  even though i was n't enough close to them to heard french , i knew they were from our country . 
  and i was n't wrong . 
  yes , we can easily spot a french tourist , they often have a quechua tent in campsite , a book `` le routard '' , a child who is sreaming , and tend to complain about everything ... 
  in french of course . 
  remaind me one of my comment in [ another thread yesterday ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askeurope/comments/5i5e6v/which_european_country_is_the_most_smug_and/db5jv5r/ ) . 
  we are just fabulous , let 's face it , 
  mais ... meuf . 
  it 's the 6th answear of this kind you send me in less than 3 days . 
  and all in separated threads . 
  what 's your problem with french people ? 
  inferiority complex ? 
  and no , the animated comics are shit while the live action was a master piece . 
   [ looks like austria pretty like french song as well ... ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zapgwvais3u ) sincerly , i think it 's really sad only france continue to use its own language for the eurovision ( with the exception of spain , italy sometimes and obviously uk and irland ) . 
  it 's supposed to be a european contest , with a share of our differents cultures . 
  now , it 's just shit pop song contest without any tie with the nationality . 
  we get the 6th place last year , only because our singer song in english the chorus . 
  it 's sad . 
  and for the announcer , they just use the second official language of the [ eurovision contest ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_broadcasting_union ) . 
  the same way we speak french at first for the jo because it was a french dude who `` invented '' it and it is now the official language of the jo . 
  and for the movies , may you give me some examples ? 
  sure , we have planty of bad movies , but there are some which are really good : intouchable , the 5th element , am\u00e9lie , la haine , asterix and obelix , cleopatra mission etc. . . 
  looks like french people agree with the fact [ we are the most arrogants in europe ] ( http://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/original-size/images/2013/05/blogs/graphic-detail/20131130_wom111_0.png ) edit : and for the least arrogant , i 'll say spain . 
  actually , my neighboor is cheminot and he admit it himself : he disagree with a lot of those strikes as well . 
  for the advantages , they have : * free travel in train everywhere in france for them and their family . 
  * a huge ce with a lot of '' [ village-vacances ] ( http://www.ccgpfcheminots.com/ ) '' . 
  they even benefit those village vacance during their retirements . 
  * the legal age for the retirement is 52 years old . 
  for a manufacturing worker , it 's 62 . 
  and they have a better pension than the other retired persons in the private . 
  * the cheminot have a pretty good wage : 3.090 euros you are speaking about the harsh conditions of living for those employees . 
  maybe , but i will not pity them . 
  we can say the same with a lot of other jobs . 
  i will play my whataboutist card here : what about a manufacturing worker ? 
  what about the family life of a doctor ? 
  a nurse ? 
  a airline pilot and the stewards ? 
  i even know lawyers in france who works under the smic for 50 hours a week ( le p\u00e9nal , ca rapporte pas ) , and vannes ' tribunal is in cessation of payments . 
  do you see them every 3 month on the media for a strike ? 
  for the `` being considered as shit '' part , well not more than the average . 
  being a '' train driver '' is even one pretty common dream job for little boy . 
  i think that being a garbage collector , fiscal inspector or a bailif is way harder . 
  the only reason sncf employees are denigrate by other workers would be because of the strikes . 
  the irony . 
  sncf employees are not more drawn in the short straw than the average . 
  and when they strike , everybody is paralysed and punished . 
  they should try more discussion with their employer or find another way of striking . 
  what irritating me the most in those kind of strikes is when the high school students strike as well , while it 's obvious they just want to skip school and do n't give a fuck about the law/reform . 
  i was in terminal ( so 17-18 years old ) when there was protestation against the retirement reform ( fixed at 62 year instead of 60 ) . 
  the 15years old students blocked the high school ( a blocus ) and boo us when we wanted to go in class because we wanted to study for the baccalaureat ( 2 month later ) . 
  but when you ask them why they are here , they are completly drop-out or recite what their parents/professor said without conviction . 
  it 's really cringy . 
  and the same for the sncf . 
  they already have a lot of privileges and are always complaning . 
  it 's never enough . 
  they have the behaviour of a diva and have a bad reputation in france because of that . 
  that 's what i was refering to . 
  a lot of people are proud of that and would mention everytime the resistance when there is a conversation about the wwii ( i agree with you , they are badass and it was really dangerous . 
  i personaly admire all the people who hided jewish people ) . 
  but a lot of those people will amplify the role and the number of resistants and considerablely reduce the number of collabo while in the reality , let face it , there was more collabo than resistants . 
  and i know , 90 % of the population just tried to survive the occupation by avoiding contacts with the germans ( let 's ignore those boches ) . 
  it 's still pretty taboo speaking about the colaboration . 
  after all , degaulle said that the whole france was [ `` r\u00e9sistante '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tlnmb-ytce ) just after the end of the wwii , and we had to wait until 1995 and jacque chirac to admit the part of responsability of france in the deportation of the jews . 
  i read a problem of stomach as well , but according to wikipedia , seems like it was just a question of style ( [ la fayette ] ( https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/main_dans_le_gilet#/media/file:marquis_de_lafayette_3.jpg ) , [ mozart ] ( https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/main_dans_le_gilet#/media/file:martini_bologna_mozart_1777.jpg ) etc. . . ), 
  for me , the biggest historical events in the current french history are : * the roman empire colonisation with the victory of jules c\u00e9sar . 
  latin is nowodays a source of our language , our law , our lifestyle etc. . * the french revolution which bring us democracy , enlightenment , the universal declaration of human rights and the metric system . 
  they also promoted the separation between the state and the clergy . 
  * napol\u00e9on : civil code , changed our administration , our laws , and spread it in the whole europe . 
  he was in the continuity of the french revolution spirit . 
  he is also one cause of our strong secularism . 
  for example , he is pretty well seen in the jewish community , because tried to emancipe them . 
  he overrode old laws restricting jews to reside in ghettos , as well as lifting laws that limited jews ' rights to property , worship , and certain occupations . 
  and i think this little guy changed the face of europe and even the world . 
  he spread nationalism in other coutries and indirectaly brought the independances wars of [ south american countries ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/latin_american_wars_of_independence ) for example , and bring nationalism in germany ( which became a empire later ) , italy ( with the risorgimento ) etc. . . * the wwii : whith the nazi occupation and the collaboration . 
  even nowodays , we still are `` shamed '' of the collaboration . 
  it 's something pretty taboo here . 
  one another hand , the wwii brought the creation of the european union . 
  now , germany is our closest `` friend '' while before the wwii , it was one of our archenemy ( with uk ) . 
  france is nowodays in its longest period of peace it ever had with its neighbours . 
  it 's really cool . 
  a. . . wooden hand ? 
  i like them . 
  we should destroy portugal as well then ... [ here we go !, 
  ] ( http://giphy.com/gifs/napoleon-born2party-vabqbriiwcpno ), 
  i will add the moment when napoleon betrayed spain in 1808 ( dick move , nap , that was a dick move ... ) the fact that we were n't that much into settlement colonialism like england or spain . 
  ( it 's more by curiosity than angry . 
  what would have been a french speaking usa ? ), 
  and the war of algeria . 
  a stupid war which could have been way less bloody with some compromises from both side . 
  he was belgian , so i agree with you , 
  but french people are true [ franks !, 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0n_ro-jl-90#t=2m45s ), 
  france is also a legit neighbour because of that : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/channel_tunnel,

   countries should try to accept only immigrants that make a significant net positive contribution . 
  dont these workers get benefits if they already worked in the uk ? 
  it 's not like they get insta-unemployment . 
  also eu immigrants provided net benefits to uk . 
  it almost looks like porn how well everything fits, 
   i feel like an institutionalised digital voting system would work very well here . 
  a few issues a year , everyone goes to the local button office and signs in , pushes a few buttons , and make their voices heard that way . 
  cause fuck talking to strangers . 
  are the police the only govt organisation that is understaffed and underpaid in sweden ? 
  how about social workers , teachers , etc ? 
   you can be deprived of your nationality on the basis of your involvement in a terrorist organization . 
  not in france . 
  thats what i was suspecting ... 
   us most people think that majority of countries budget goes to nasa so that huge ass military , that huge ass infrastructure and teachers , doctors etc. . . americans think their salary does n't take a big chunk ? 
   un conventions , human rights bullshit and such ... 
  it 's already the friggin principle of it . 
  you do n't make people stateless . 
  lets not return to the dark days of ww2, 
   should the eu ever decide that germany is the primary place where we should spend resources for development that would happen simply by the fact that they have more people . 
  that 's not how it works . 
  germany does n't have a majority in the parlament . 
  also that 's silly . 
  germany is a net contribuitor to the eu budget . 
   additionally the votes in the council of the eu are proportional to the population of a country . 
  in the parlament of serbia , does belgrade get the same number of seats as novi sad ? 
  if people get less funding in novi sad and it starts sucking , they 're forced to move to belgrade . 
   the commission is indirectly elected , which is what i disagree with the most . 
  do you directly elect your govt ? 
  so why would the eu be any different ? 
  you dont want power to the people in the eu . 
  you want power to serbia , which is undemocratic . 
   you seem to be all talk and no evidence , please , write in some evidence as to why we should bother ? 
  in 1997 , the gdp per capita of bulgaria was about ** 2.5 ** times smaller when compared to serbia . 
  in 2013 , bulgaria 's gdp is 20 % ** smaller ** . 
  compared to bulgaria , you went from ** +2500 % ** to ** -20 % ** . 
  in 2003 ( so after the war ) . 
  the gdp per capita of serbia was slightly larger than the gdp of romania . 
  in 2014 , romania 's gdp per capita is about 10k and serbia about 6k . 
  that is 40 % smaller . 
  oh and lets not compare with poland . 
   why would you want us ? 
  that 's weird . 
  i heard the same question from a serbian friend . 
  do you think the future of the eu depends on whether serbia joins or not ? 
  honest question . 
  do you think the future of your children will depend if serbia joins or not ? 
  romanian , bulgarian and polish kids live better now , even though in 2003 , romanian and serbia people were about as wealthy . 
  and in the future the gap will only continue to increase . 
  but hey serbia stronk !, 
  serbia is more important than the serbians and how they live . 
  neither is uk then , nor germany , nor canada , nor denmark , nor norway , nor sweden ... 
  the list goes on and on and and on . 
  do you think a constitution protects your free speech ? 
  ask the japanese during ww2 , ask the blacks during segregation , ask the blacks during the slavery period . 
  and france is a republic so yeah . 
  nothing . 
  he missed an olympics because of politics . 
   well they 're immigrants , so we ca n't hold them to the same standard as normal people apparently there are people , whom i never met , that say that the law system should be more lenient to immigrants . 
  i have yet to see such people though . 
  edit : uk never ceases to prove me wrong . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/diamonds_affair https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/great_oil_sniffer_hoax and if greece got into the eu with all its problems , well you have vge to thank . 
   we count france out of pretty much everything these days . 
    syrian refugee crisis and for that we thank you . 
   many small ( tiny even ) countries okay . 
  count france out of that military schengen . 
   romanian mario monti oh god , i hope not . 
   french president valery giscard d'estaing . 
  now that 's a regrettable politician . 
  okay that 's your belief , mine is different . 
  we 'll have to agree to disagree . 
   to the predictable defense that he was talking about rioters , who are not just any individuals , those israelis were referencing the killing of enemy soldiers and rioters , not innocent arabs . 
  so calling rioters `` racaille '' is the same as this :  bennett : `` if you catch terrorists , you have to simply kill them . ''  amidror : `` listen , that 's not legal . ''  bennett : `` i 've killed lots of arabs in my life -- and there 's no problem with that . '' your former minister of economy , that de-facto declares that he has carried out the capital punishment ** outside of the judicial system ** . 
  and condones it . 
  notice he says that if you ** catch ** them . 
  so once caught and neutralised , he is for killing them . 
  those are not values i want to associate with . 
  yes i agree that france has a shameful past . 
  why deny it for jingoistic reasons . 
   nah , it 's just that you have ** citizens ** of different entities living in their respective places . 
  what friggin citizens . 
  palestine is not a state so they can not have a palestinian citizenship . 
  they 're given a dummy passport but no citizenship . 
  anyone who is against the two state solution is effectively for colonisation . 
  my values are against colonialism . 
  end of discussion . 
  how do we know that this is true and not some karma baiting ? 
  edit : crazies ** do ** teach ( from bialystok ) . 
  since it is topical , i 'll quote max bialystock from the producers :  that 's our hitler !, 
  sauces in this comment by / u/lekiouses : https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3sb7sc/this_is_an_actual_homework_a_middle_school/cwvpnvp apparently , you ** can not ** make up shit like this . 
   drawing attention to the absurdity of the law the majority of the french are not in the streets demanding to change the law , so ... fail ? 
   try growing up and stop forcing your will onto others . 
  people should follow the laws of their land . 
  if i dont agree with a law , i dont try to break it . 
  i try to change it . 
  m'bala * 2 should lobby not break laws . 
  the us has its laws , france has its ones . 
  i hope you understand why your values are not exactly mine and why a diversity of political systems is a good thing . 
  i am simply explaining that telling 500k french citizens that they should pack up and leave to the us or canada is stupid . 
  they 're french . 
  they speak french .

  not unproductive . 
  a crucial company connecting marseille to corsica . 
  a profitable shipyard . 
  strategic french interests . 
  but the eu would rather they die or be sold . 
  it 's not normal that france helping them is outright forbidden . 
  french people elected these people , they should accept if we pay to save companies . 
  they 're the most easy comparison . 
  there could be other comparisons , but this one is n't wrong either . 
  there sure are a lot of people here that are bothered by that nazi comparison . 
  i did n't say anything about you being racist , just that calling me a gatekeeper was uncalled for given the context . 
  i do get to call out people whose first instinct in this thread is point out the perpetrators are muslims . 
  you want to criticize islam and any other religion ? 
  fine by me , i hate religions . 
  but if the first thing you think of when you read an article about gay people being put in camps and killed is how you 're going to make an edgy comment about muslims ( not islam as an oppressive patriarchal structure that needs to evolve or disappear , no , `` muslims '' ) being barbaric , yeah you can bet i 'm going say you care more about sticking it up to muslims than defending gay people . 
  get you priorities straight ( ha !, 
  ) , and learn that there is such a thing as progressive criticism of islam that does n't stigmatizes practitioners . 
  but it does n't , like , reminisces you of nazi method and ideology ? 
  no war was won through bombing alone . 
  thanks for pointing out i forgot that last word . 
  are you seriously defending nazis on the basis that other people did the same ? 
  controversial , negative karma . 
  / r/europe so left-wing and a progressive bastion . 
  i wonder why could have caused me to associate people rounding up a group they are prejudiced against into camps to torture and kill them with nazism . 
  that clearly has nothing to with one another . 
  then go donate to one . 
  waiting for the receipt and everything . 
  oh , right , calling out racists for pretending to support gay people only when it serves their interest is totally gatekeeping . 
  i 'm sure lgbt people love that company . 
  not that there are plenty of threads on / r/lgbt or / r/ainbow that tell racists to fuck off for being hypocrites , like after the orlando night club shooting . 
  you ca n't recall the silence racist have about lgbt issues when they ca n't weaponize it in a racist way ? 
  that 's the rest of the time . 
  you ca n't see them because they do n't care , it goes against their white natalist worldview . 
  and yet we bailed out capitalists in 2008 without any problem . 
  why the double standard ? 
  france was fined for helping specific companies financially instead of letting them die or being bought by foreign interest , for example . 
  it went against eu free-market . 
  eu free-market was seen as more important than france 's economy and job . 
   that 's a very complicated issue which m\u00e9lenchon has n't answered either as far as i know . 
  like mentioned earlier , yes he has , it 's the un position , a global coalition with russia and the us sitting at the same table agreeing to a common objective , even if temporary and they get back to playing chess later . 
  what bothers me with what you 're saying is that you 're outright dismissing the sensible solution , favored by m\u00e9lenchon and backed by the un , simply because you see it as unrealistic . 
  that 's not the issue . 
  there are two things : what should we do , and what are we doing right now . 
  just because `` right now '' it 's more realistic to bomb and scheme does n't mean we ca n't agree that getting around a table would be better and working toward that goal would benefit everyone . 
  the two are n't incompatible , they 're just different timeframes . 
  yet , history matters . 
  that 's why germany recognizes it 's role in nazi horror . 
  that 's why turkey is asked to recognize the armenian genocide . 
  it 's not about guilt , it 's about a common recognition of history so we can get past it and forge new bonds . 
  technically , yes . 
  in practice , the eu treaties have liberalism written in them , not socialism . 
  and hardly any country is anti-liberal . 
  that 's the problem , the appearance of being fair when in fact the game is rigged in your favor . 
   you can majorly impact a conflict without putting boots on the ground . 
  i agree , but under whose directive ? 
  russia and the us playing chess ? 
  what do syrians have to say in the matter ? 
  like , why ca n't we form a coalition that focuses on eradicating isis in syria and dividing the won territories among assad/rebel groups , then focus on assad/rebels peace after that ? 
  who benefits from letting isis have so much leeway ? 
  can we follow that thread and see were it leads ? 
  these are questions that need answering before shouting `` lets bomb the place '' . 
  you have it backward , it gives every country the right to oppose socialist policies . 
  i 'm not saying it 's easy , but that 's still the most sensible position . 
  no war was won through bombing alone ( edit : well one was ended with two bombs , ask japan ) . 
  if we bomb , what is our objective ? 
  if we want to end the conflict , when are we sending troops ? 
  i agree . 
  since the beginning he says we need a global coalition ( instead of nato/russia playing chess ) , put assad , rebel groups ( not isis , they 're terrorist and do n't get a seat ) , local actors around the table , and find a way to end the conflict , most likely through elections . 
  utopist and naive ? 
  you tell me , that 's the position the un adopted late last year . 
  hey nazi apologists , is it okay to talk about nazis now or do we need to wait until a few thousands have died ? 
  talking about nazis wo n't devalues the word 's meaning , huh ? 
  edit : wow , a few people making good points , but so much telling me i 'm wrong on behalf on nazis , so brave . 
  edit 2 : i 'm sorry for the shitshow mods , kinda . 
  but i 'm laughing my ass off , hahaha . 
  what if free market hurts one of these countries , what do we do ? 
  what if easing up on free market would help that country without damaging the others ? 
  we can do that , ca n't we , it 's the reasonable thing to do ? 
  i 'm not asking for the whole eu to became `` far-left '' , not that m\u00e9lenchon is far-left anyway , he 's just a historical socialist . 
  i 'm asking other countries to simply accept that france could elect a socialist , and let him implement socialist policies at a domestic level . 
  that means in instances where eu treaties forbid implementing socialist policies at a domestic level , changing the treaties . 
  i 'm asking more political freedom for everyone . 
  should make consensus , no ? 
  no , there was the possibility to enforce them , but it still required political will to do it and point the finger in the right direction . 
  just like because you have a police force does n't mean there is n't crime , you still need to tell it what to do and were to go . 
  except the treaties removed that police force entirely , and now we 're complaining that criminals are n't playing nice . 
  i mean , what we 're talking about here is essentially what should legitimately be under eu directive and changing it requires majority/consensus , and what should be a domestic issue that does n't require external approval . 
  the point of contention , the reason m\u00e9lenchon is painted as anti-eu , is that he believes economic liberalism should n't be sacralized by the treaties , while other countries seem fine with it . 
  what he 's asking is to put back economic policies into the domestic domain , put it back into people 's democratic reach . 
  so , the disobedience problem becomes : is what m\u00e9lenchon is asking reasonable . 
  like , even if you 're a liberal , do you believe it 's normal that if a country elects a socialist , that country ca n't have socialist policies because it 's forbidden at the eu level . 
  it 's a real serious question . 
  if other countries want to disobey as well , they better do it over serious matters and nothing frivolous . 
  nobody seems to want to disobey anyway so i 'm not sure it 's in question . 
  if it were to happen , it would test the eu 's ability to resolve conflict , and i 'm honestly not so attached to it that i would n't let it die if it was n't able to deal with the situation . 
  you want to pretend to be some world class union , you better be solid . 
  you ca n't handle internal disagreement without disintegrating ? 
  maybe you were n't meant to be , try again on a more solid / flexible framework . 
  we can order control of capital movement . 
  it 's just the eu that forbids it because free-market and all , but putting it back in place in case we leave is in m\u00e9lenchon 's plan .

  there is such a thing as a ceiling when it comes to the tastiness of any particular food . 
  i am sure most countries can find good potatoes and fry them in a proper way . 
  any religion is okey for me just practice your thing in private and do n't ask or revendicate anything . 
  maybe you ca n't date because you are batshit insane ? 
  it certainly is the way you come across in your comments . 
  hivemind mentality mainly . 
  a few people will start doing it for some reason and everyone will just jump on the bandwagon blindly . 
  if i hear about your religion i do n't like it . 
  the good religion to me is the one that keeps to itself . 
  english is pretty easy to learn . 
  the neutral form was weird to me coming from a language where everything has a gender but i would not call that difficult to understand . 
  stella artois , costs around 4-5 $ for a pint . 
  the cheapest way to get drunk in france is generally pastis though . 
  it is hard liquor and costs 2 $ . 
  any politician suggering anything close to that in france would be crucified and lose any chance of being elected . 
  that gives a good idea of he opinion of the majority of french people on this matter . 
  the nazi movement had pretty much nothing to do with christianism . 
  hitler openly disdained christianism as a whole . 
  funnily enough some high ranking nazi officials did have a boner for islam as they thought it created fearless soldiers . 
  scottish and irish people are very well considered in france . 
  for me it 's always 24th evening with close family then lunch the day after with extended family . 
  24th is seen as more important generally and we really stuff our mouths and drink large amounts of champagne and the 25th is more casual and relaxed . 
  studied russian for a bit in univ but only did the basics ( it was my third foreign language ) . 
  i recently started studying it again through duolingo . 
  the lessons are not available in my mother language though so i use english . 
  hey at least you avoided the `` i am eastern european myself '' . 
  it 's not that bad !, 
  bonapartists are pretty much all found in les r\u00e9publicains . 
  they generally are pretty okey with democracy as it is . 
  orl\u00e9anistes are not really far right . 
  they are pretty progressive right wing movement and most of them vote for lr and are okey with republic too . 
  they are lightly anticlerical and support education for everyone and parlementarism . 
  they do n't think of themselves as non-european because they want out of eu . 
  those are two different things . 
  if we believe our journalists and pretty much everyone in national medias : paris = france, 
  yeah , i still have to find a supermarket in france that does not sell them and i know i will have a honest product for its price . 
  especially in smaller supermarkets where the only alternatives are lustucru and panzani . 
  they are very decent pasta , the sauce sticks to them well and they cook well too . 
   panzani sorry italy for bringing panzani to this world . 
  the problem is mainly that 90 % of the times the affermation `` i am irish / italian / whatever '' is followed by a stupid stereotype . 
  example : `` i am irish mate , i can hold my liquor ! '', 
  or `` i am italian , i know my pizza ! '', 
  this kind of stereotype is tiring enough in normal times but when it is uttered by someone who claims to be belonging from your country it is just ten times worst . 
  you may have italian or irish roots ( which generally means that one of your ancestors actually ever saw the place ) and that 's cool if you decide to research about those but if you claim yourself an italian or irish you 'd better speak the language fluently and at least live a few years there just so you know what you are talking about . 
  just to put that in your perspective it 's as if one of my great grandfathers was from the us and had emigrated to france , imagine for the sake of this argument that i do n't speak a word of english . 
  i would go around in france telling everyone how i am an american and how much i love guns , freedom and how much i know literally everything about ribs and i would only drive a huge truck wearing a cow boy hat , us flag shirts and snake skin boots because that 's how american i am . 
  that 's how this kind of people feel to us . 
  they are people who do n't know anything about the country they claim to come from and are just walking , talking clich\u00e9s . 
  from the top of my head : barilla , de cecco , mulino bianco , giovanni rana are pretty common food brands in french supermarkets . 
  kappa is pretty common for sportswear . 
  panzeri used to be very common too when i was a teenager but it 's hardly seen anymore . 
  armani , azzaro , dolce gabbana for clothes . 
  http://i.imgur.com/5rstvng.jpg a better version for you < 3, 
  i always heard romania and france have enjoyed each other 's friendship for a long time . 
  do n't know the details though . 
  in a limited way . 
  i do n't care about colour , it 's about culture . 
  i do n't want foreign cultures to be present in any big way in france . 
  i would be okey with 15 % or maybe 20 % but that should absolutly not exceed that in my opinion . 
  i just do n't see the advantages of multiculturalism and i think once it is no longer clear what is the culture of a given country it only brings tensions and troubles . 
  if there was any advantage to it to counter balance that i could think on it further but there is absolutly no advantage that i can think of . 
  `` do your women really do n't shave ? '', 
  `` did france ever won a war ? '', 
  being self centered ? 
  france is less free trade oriented than some yeah . 
  agricultural policies are heavily biased toward people with big agriculture sector . 
  we are a big country and we have more agriculture than most similar countries so we get more if you look at raw numbers but that 's not more than our share . 
  really ? 
  i do n't remember us doing anything particularly bad recently . 
  for me it 's : native : french fluent : english , italian know some basics : russian, 
  i do n't play but i love the books and video games . 
  love the imperial guard , i devoured the gaunt 's ghosts book series and i loved ciaphas cain 's adventures too . 
  i like that they are just standard grunts thrown in conflicts against chaos demons and the likes and they still manage to win the day using grit , courage and comradry . 
  space marines books are cool too but they are much less relatable , they are genetically enhanced soldiers that feel no fear and have access to super advanced equipement . 
  they are cool and badass at all but they are barely human anymore . 
  love the food . 
  do n't know many indians though ( it is not a big community in france ) . 
  i know pretty much nothing about their domestic policies . 
  i like how they tend to refuse to align with anyone and act as a strictly neutral government on the international scene . 
  this is a stance i respect . 
  i always been taught that romanian was a romance language . 
  i have both . 
  for everyday cooking i generally just use non-stick pans . 
  for sauce based meals or for searing a piece of meat i am a big fan of [ staub products ] ( https://www.staub-online.com/uk/en/home.html ) . 
  they cost an arm and a leg but they are just marvellous . 
  pretty much the same . 
  broadly we could say that there are three big `` zones '' in france : the north which has the reputation of being piss poor , alcoholic and inbred but nice . 
  the south has the reputation of being hot tempered , loud and annoying . 
  paris , well i think parisians ' reputation is pretty much global so i probably do n't need to expand on them . 
  the usual 100 % factual and unbiased reports : russians and pro-gov syrians commit atrocities for fun while the courageous non-extremist / democracy loving rebels are sacrificing themselves to save the babies . 
  i do n't really agree . 
  i think the peoples are getting a bit too cozy and lost the will to fight for their freedom . 
  i often feel like as long as they have a roof over their head , a tv set and food people just do n't care anymore . 
  our anthem reminds us that freedom is bought with the blood of patriots and tyrants ( like thomas jefferson said ) . 
  this was true at the time and it is still true today , and i believe will all my heart that it will be true still for as long as humanity exists . 
  this song is badass as fuck though and i love its message . 
  you forgot the king : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhefbx81xwq, 
  france +10 cooking skills +20 resistance to economic reforms can invoke a bottle of wine to recharge mana and a deer p\u00e2t\u00e9 baguette sandwich to recharge life . 
  wearing jeans is okey really , depends if your jeans fits well and with what you wear them . 
  if you wear low quality jeans that look like a sack of potatoes yeah it looks like shit .

   maybe a smaller union is better , it will have to include all the countries that are currently in the eurozone hollande is in favor for a fiscal union . 
  currently the issue is in germany 's court . 
  greece would have to exit probably . 
  hence the smaller union . 
  after some googling : though honestly it 's very complicated , what the different camps are http://www.euractiv.fr/sections/euro-finances/france-et-allemagne-poussent-pour-plus-dintegration-economique-en-ue-314833 seems like both germany and france want a fiscal union . 
  so why do ~ ~ people ~ ~ romanians say gypsies are thieves and not : those particular romanians are thieves ? 
   as for negative opinions , it 's not yet forbidden here i 'm still kinda sure if you go at your job and say darn those fuckin gypsies , you can expect to be reprimanded . 
   respect has to mutual , not just one sided . 
  i agree , ~ ~ dumbass ~ ~ kind sir . 
   germany will not accept a `` smaller union '' , even if it what france wants . 
  at some point fiscal unification will have to be done . 
  either that or everything will fall apart . 
  i fully agree the current two-speed system is not do-able . 
  there 's no point in sharing some things but not other things . 
  i burst out laughing :d if only europe was shitty . 
  we wouldnt have the syrian crisis either . 
  tonight im going out and vandalizing my city . 
  how dare we have nice things . 
   read some history about the expansion of the eu into eastern europe . 
  so uk ** is ** in favor of free movement for romanians and bulgarians ? 
  i made another comment that applies here as well : so we are in agreement . 
  either more europe or less of it . 
  if uk wants less of it fine . 
  if other countries want more , fine as well . 
  anyone who can say that is one option that is clearly better than the other is bsing . 
  so we are in agreement . 
  either more europe or less of it . 
  if uk wants less of it fine . 
  if other countries want more , fine as well . 
  anyone who can say that is one option that is clearly better than the other is bsing . 
  i have to call merkel to hash out the plans . 
   except the gypsies refered to in such complaints are not adapting . 
  if i treat you as a thief , a liar and an untrustworthy person even though you never did such things , what can you do ? 
   this cycle was attempted to be broken by even the communists and they failed . 
  iliescu has gypsy origins . 
  nastase too . 
  sure they effed up , but claiming they didnt have potential to do great things and that they didnt achieve a lot is pure bs . 
   use google translate on this ama from r/romania , it might enlighten you . 
  i know more that you 'd suspect . 
  i just dont hide myself behind poorly made excuses . 
   hopefully you will be able to fix the eurozone so that far more money is transferred from the richer parts to the poorer parts and change the treaties to reflect that and get the peoples of the eurozone to endorse those changes in referendums . 
  good luck with that . 
  well finally some sense . 
  that 's how people will finally prosper . 
  maybe a smaller union is needed at first . 
  but more integration is what i want . 
   gdp growth in wales is better than the eu as a whole and with lower unemployment . . china has higher gdp growth than any country in the eu . 
  i still dont want to live there . 
  also in poverty levels you 're doing much worse than france http://www.inequalitywatch.eu/spip.php?article99&amp;lang=en it does n't look good my friend . 
  worse than france . 
  can you imagine ? 
  if they are performing bad the currency does not hide that and they can do the appropriate measures to tackle the issue . 
  wales is performing badly . 
  should wales have its own currency ? 
  and scotland ? 
  the eu caused the ukranian crisis . 
  til, 
  ( i ) expanding into eastern europe , ( ii ) the single market , ( iii ) the single currency and ( iv ) the schengenzone . 
  the first two were pushed by the uk harder than anyone else . 
  you can not be serious . 
  uk is the one that wants to put restriction on romanians and bulgarians . 
  thinking a massive exodus would happen etc etc. 
  germany is currently the one saying that the uk can not impose restrictions on romanian or bulgarian workers . 
  france pushed for a single currency harder than germany ? 
  dude what kind of news are you getting over there ? 
   even on oh so anonymous internet . 
  who got fired from being a dick on 4chan in poland ? 
  honest question, 
   the current crisis is the most significant thing that has happened in europe since the fall of the berlin wall in terms of potential for social change . 
  so something that happened just 26 years ago ? 
   large demographic and cultural shifts and the window for preventing wait 2 million syrians will change europe 4ever ? 
  omg . 
  so should wales have its own currency then ? 
  because clearly it 's a super poor region and it 's not getting any better . 
  what is that `` appropriate level . '', 
   , i 've had two roma colleagues in school and they were n't bullied or discriminated and did you ever ask your friend if they ever faced racist comments in the bus or on the street ? 
   but there needs to be added cultural context since when most people say something like that they refer to the stereotypical portrayal of roma , that 's what friggin racism is based on . 
  the generalization of negative perceptions based on stereotypes . 
  you just described racism there in a nutshell . 
  1940 `` jews are rats and negros are an inferior race '' racism and anti-semitism is over and done with in europe . 
  nobody in france thinks all muslims are fanatics that want to blow everything up . 
   i 'm sure you know the vast majority of voters only remember/care about what they have seen in the last few years . 
  so it 's time to sit back and look at the grand scheme maybe ? 
  all the benefits we 're having are n't the result of only the last 5 years . 
  ah the forever solution to a poorly working economy : devaluate . 
  why push for reforms when you can just print money ? 
   i think a lot will depend on the handling of the refugee crisis . 
  because a project that has been in place for the last 60 years must depend on something that 's been happening since last year . 
  makes perfect sense . 
   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/black_wednesday and look how well being independent works out . 
  good luck trying to short the euro . 
   their task is to build a federal system that works and is democratic music to my ears . 
  so nobody complains that the gypsies live in shacks ? 
  no romanian has ever told you that it sucks to live next to gypsies ? 
  that gypsies are a bunch of thieves ? 
  you never heard that in romania ? 
  you must have been suuuuuper sheltered . 
  not to mention the ussr . 
   jews in poland ? 
  a safehaven .

  bayrou sided with hollande and it was a huge shock . 
  his vote rbase did n't agree !, 
  the center was usually the left of `` lr '' and bayrou just hated sarkozy . 
  macron has really changed everything in that regard . 
  or you could consider that hollande was an anomaly because of sarkozy and dsk . 
  the polls are not showing the whole story . 
  chirac and sarkozy after him won the elections easily . 
  hell , jospin did n't even make the second turn in 2002 and there was a strong fn that year . 
  you have to consider the candidates if you put the polls forward . 
  macron is not a socialist . 
  marine le pen + fran\u00e7ois fillon gather more voters than the united left . 
  and fran\u00e7ois fillon would gather a lot more if he was not a crooked politician . 
  had the `` p\u00e9n\u00e9lopegate '' not surfaced , he 'd be higher than macron and there would n't be a race . 
  exactly . 
  and i think it 's primordial as you say to distinguish civil marriage and religious marriage . 
  i for one will never get married in a church but rather at the town hall . 
  some people are misled to believe that it is a religious institution that is brought down but in truth , people and the church are still free to behave the way they want to . 
  nobody is going to force a priest 's hand . 
  on the other hand , a public servant should n't have a moral objection to perform a gay marriage regardless of his intimate religious convictions on the matter . 
  i think that in a way , legalizing gay marriage is a rectification of a de facto situation where long term same sex couple could n't enjoy the same rights as straight couple while living the very same conditions . 
  all in all it falls down under the role of the state to guarantee the same rights for everyone and promote the nuclear family as a social basis . 
  i must add that to me a civil union is something else entirely than a marriage , like the french pacs ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/civil_solidarity_pact ) a marriage `` light '' . 
  think of it differently . 
  fillon will never go under 18 % . 
  he represents the biggest french party `` lr '' , the mainstream right . 
  france is a right-leaning country . 
  no matter which candidate they put forward , the right voters will vote for an lr candidate no matter what because quite frankly they have no alternative . 
  i 'm pretty sure most of them would like another candidate , but after the primaries it 's not easy to replace him , so they probably vote for the party , or the program , but not for the man . 
  a lot of lr voters are calling for him to step down , but it 's a risky situation if he does . 
  who would replace him ? 
  someone he beat at the primaries , some other person ? 
  from a legal point of view i agree with you when you talk about marriage as a way to incentivize procreation but as a society we 've moved past that and i think that marriage has just become the union of two lovers , an incentive not necessarily to procreate but to create a family . 
  a lot of gays do n't like gay marriage because they consider straight people `` breeders '' and they do n't want kids . 
  in the end the matter is very anecdotical as only a few percents of the total population is homosexual and among them , from what i 've seen in my country , only a sizable minority is considering marriage . 
  to me it 's just a matter of equality in giving the same tools to start a family to same-sex lovers and straight lovers . 
  i used to be of your opinion though . 
  edit : my main problem at the same time was that i thought it was unfair to deprive a child of the chance to have both a father and a mother . 
  but honestly i think two fathers or two mothers can give a lot of love just as well to a child . 
  you could have picked jambon de bayonne instead of this very plain thing . 
  pata negra is indiscutably the best ham in the whole world . 
  i had some last christmas , it was magical . 
  but you ca n't win the battle of charcuterie . 
  i was not very clear . 
  the fn du sud is still on le pen dad page economy wise . 
  i dont think of it as left and right either . 
  zemmour 's thesis is partly true . 
  french jews were deported , but later than foreign jews , in 1942 . 
  to me you replace `` american exceptionalism '' with french in this excerpt and it 's the very same . 
  let 's agree to disagree then . 
  le pen 's program is leaning on the left by some aspects but you 'd be mistaken to think it 's socialism . 
  it 's `` ni gauche ni droite , fran\u00e7ais '' as they used to say . 
  just like the british , she 's strongly anti-eu , this euroskepticism is to me a form of small governement . 
  just like trump , she 's protectionnist . 
  and lastly there are two fn 's . 
  there is the fn `` du nord '' ( phillipot ) , and the fn `` du sud '' ( le pen ) . 
  she 's juggling with both and while the north one is made up of the disappointed blue-collar workers and the other losers of globalization , the second one is still the very much same basis of voters that voted for the one-eyed anti-system antisemitic candidate that was her father back in the 80 's . 
  not in the american term no . 
  i think he 's more `` christian-democrat '' . 
  it 's way less extreme . 
   american conservatism is a broad system of political beliefs in the united states that is characterized by respect for american traditions , support for judeo-christian values , economic liberalism , anti-communism , advocacy of american exceptionalism , and a defense of western culture from perceived threats posed by `` creeping socialism '' , moral relativism , multiculturalism , and liberal internationalism . 
  liberty is a core value , with a particular emphasis on strengthening the free market , limiting the size and scope of government , and opposition to high taxes and government or labor union encroachment on the entrepreneur . 
  american conservatives consider individual liberty , within the bounds of conformity to american values , as the fundamental trait of democracy , which contrasts with modern american liberals , who generally place a greater value on equality and social justice . 
  [ 1 ] [ 2 ] does this sound more like lr or fn to you ? 
  to me it sounds more like fn ( wikipedia ) . 
  le pen father said that the german occupation `` was n't that bad '' . 
  which is not great communication skills . 
  zemmour argued , and he was right historically , that p\u00e9tain protected the jews of french nationality during ww2 as much as he could from the nazis but `` gave away '' those who were n't french . 
  this was highly controversial , he was accused of defending p\u00e9tain and being antisemitic , even though he 's jewish himself . 
  not more collectivist than what we already have . 
  in us elections , religion and family life plays a much bigger part . 
  that being said , i doubt a gay candidate could be elected . 
  the older generation is the most decisive , and i think he 'd lose more than a few percents . 
  it 's suspected they already tried . 
  a rumor that he would be gay has shady origins , but it did n't really take . 
  sputnik relayed it , as well as other websites . 
  and do n't you think mlp also adores private entreprise ? 
  the definition of socialism which is anti-business is antiquated in current politics . 
  that kind of reflexion belongs to marxists parties . 
  oh yeah , we 're talking about the party whose president wants to enact a protectionistic trade policy putting america first ? 
  the one who tries to strong arms car manufacturer to keep their jobs in the us and threatens them with tariffs ... this is exactly le pen 's platform . 
  they both appeal to the losers of globalization . 
  in different ways sure , it 's different countries , but it 's the same deal . 
  as i said , it 's very hard to do a comparison . 
  the us is as a basis , way more right leaning than france , a country where atheist and socialist are not adjectives that would get you de facto disqualified for the presidential race . 
  so if you take an american leftist candidate like sanders , he 's probably campaigning for things we already have here like free healthcare . 
  if you consider le pen , one key promise of her program is `` france first '' , `` la pr\u00e9f\u00e9rence nationale '' as she call it is the belief that whenever there are a french citizen and a foreign citizen in competition for a public office job , or a public housing slot , the french citizen is to be favored . 
  that sounds like the kind of shit the gop favors , even lighter . 
  all in all , it is clear to me that the french leftist candidates are way more leftist than the democrats in the us , even though any comparison is very hard to make . 
  the establishment democrats are closer to fillon 's position . 
  le pen to the american republican party . 
  macron is an independent . 
  there is no real comparison to us politics . 
  it 's something i never understood . 
  proportional elections . 
  i 'll vote for macron and he 's going to enforce that promise ( maybe ) because that was ( one of ) the condition for bayrou giving him support but really it seems like a step back to the 4th republic constitution . 
  a republic that had so much turmoil in the parliaments with unstable coallitions that no clear majority could be established and ruling the country was impossible in the long term . 
  some rankings would say we are less democratic because of it . 
  at least with a non-proportional system , a 40 % relative majority can control 60 % + of the parliament seats and pass laws and the executive can govern . 
  that 's also why i like a strong president in terms of powers invested in him . 
  as cl\u00e9menceau said `` to take a decision you need an impair number of person and three is already too many '' .

   let greece and italy deal with the refugee crisis on their own .

  12-13 i guess  fix their own food ? 
  my mom taught me and my brother at around 10 . 
  really depends on the family though ( and it 'll most often be very basic food )  play outside alone ? 
  nowadays i do n't know as parents seem very overprotective . 
  around 8 maybe for me  visit a friend 's house alone ? 
  8 too i guess  go to the shops alone ?

  i do n't remember asking for that  general freedom of movement ? 
  at 16 i 'd say parents would n't care about where you go as soon as you do n't get into trouble .

  for the name of your friend , eskenazi is a typical ashkenazi name . 
  [ there is a short wikipedia page that explains where the name comes from . 
  well , technically hollande as the president is the supreme chief of the army . 
  a general has to obey anything he says , which includes nuking le pen 's house if he wants to .

  you remember well indeed , it was the d\u00e9cret cr\u00e9mieux that granted them citizenship in 1870 . 
  that would mean they were counted i guess , especially since algeria was an integral part of france at the time . 
  still , there were a lot of jews in tunisia and morocco . 
  for example in tunisia they were 100 000 in 1948 and they are only 1500 today . 
  most of them left to france or isra\u00ebl . 
  same for morocco , they were hundreds of thousands in the early 20th century and only 2500 today . 
  [ u/account235 explained it pretty well . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5xsdy3/hollande_my_ultimate_duty_is_to_prevent_a_le_pen/dekinao/ ) i would add the various scandals , the biggest being about cahuzac , minister of budget in charge of tackling tax evasion who ... had a secret account in switzerland . 
  and that was revealed less then a year after he took office . 
  a true genius . 
  the simple fact that this is the first time ever a president is not even running for a second term because he 's so hated says a lot . 
  yeah which one ? 
  come on man ... also , if they had something on macron they would have dropped the bomb by now . 
  41\u00a0520\u00a0000 inhabitants in 1933 , 64\u00a0859\u00a0599 in 20167 . 
  225 000 jews in 1933 , 475 000 in 2017 . 
  they more than doubled , so the jewish population grew significantly bigger than the general population . 
  there are two reasons basically . 
  first , france has seen `` only '' 26 % of its jewish population killed in wwii . 
  do n't get me wrong , this is a horrifying number of course [ but it 's one of the lowest . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/history_of_the_jews_during_world_war_ii#history ) secondly , after the lost of our north african colonies a lot of jews migrated from there to france , with the climate becoming quite hostile for them . 
  which is why most french jews are sephardi , not ashkenazi . 
  to be expelled or persecuted in eastern europe as well after a couple of centuries of tolerance . 
  pretty much their history repeating itself forever . 
  absolutely , what a disgrace this man is . 
  taking a white knight stand after the worst term in history , seeing the fn basically doubling their voter base . 
  and now , in a month and a half , he 's gon na save france from le pen . 
  ` reached the bottom but keep digging ' as we say . 
  that pretty much seals it for the right , i do n't see how something else than macron vs le pen can happen on the 2nd round now .

  the british and french empires were at their peak in 1920 , expanding like never before throughout the 19th century . 
  hell , we started our second colonial empire in 1815 . 
  [ this is a map of colonial empires in 1800 , ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:colonial_empires_in_1800.svg ) not so long after you took your independence . 
  [ this is the same map for 1898 . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:world_1898_empires_colonies_territory.png ) but be proud all you want my friend . 
   they actually abolished slavery and suppressed it worldwide . 
  no they did not , do you know anything about your civil war and the reasons behind it ? 
  the british were certainly the biggest contributor to the end of the slave trade and slavery ( which still exists today , not officially though ) , i give them that . 
  but they surely did n't suppress it in the american continent or across the french empire . 
  the british suppressed it in the british empire and a few other places , but it 's ridiculous to claim they did it worldwide . 
  edit : downvoted for pointing out a blatantly absurd historical fallacy ... reddit never ceases to amaze me . 
  and of course i just get downvotes and no replies . 
  lol . 
  i guess some prefer to boost their little nationalist egos rather than reading the truth . 
  if france decided to invade and colonise india tomorrow , do you think britain should keep quiet because of its colonial past there ? 
  also , i feel there is a difference between respectfully criticising a country for what it did and jumping on a random guy who happened to be from that country to blame all the past on him . 
  i see what you mean , but it 's a bit more complicated than that . 
  there is not much to do , private companies give as much of their private money to their private employees . 
  it 's per capita , the uk has a large population . 
  are you saying you do n't have equal pay for equal work in sweden ? 
   if you say that only half of them stay , that 's 130,000 $ per person . 
  that 's not an amount of money that ca n't be made up by the taxes such a person pays here over several years . 
  that 's assuming 100 % of the taxes that person pays is funding universities and nothing else . 
  needless to explain why this is n't how it works . 
  at all . 
  largest \u2260 most powerful , that 's a pretty fucking huge difference . 
  no source or reference in your wikipedia article . 
   interesting that you can still praise trump in france . 
  you have to understand that fn voters do n't know who trump is and what he does . 
  to them , he 's the anti-immigration guy and that 's it . 
  they do n't read the ny times or follow what 's going on in the us , they were told he 's the anti-establishment incarnation and they do n't want to know more about it . 
  they 're just not interested . 
  wilders on the other hand is from the netherlands , the european country with the highest proficiency in english . 
  dutch people read and watch a lot more news in english and know who trump is . 
  no real difference , your attempt at sarcasm was just ... poor . 
   the fact is things like maternity leave and other benefits they pay to women cost more over the lifetime of employment so to balance the cost they need to pay women less . 
  but they do n't , or the difference is marginal . 
  [ for example in germany ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gender_pay_gap#germany ) the wage gap between a man and woman equally qualified , with the same experience and of the same age is less than 2 % . 
  other western countries have similar numbers . 
  ok that 's ridiculous . 
  [ a light tunnel is already forming for her arrival !, 
  i agree the difference in the cost of life is n't that big , especially as you said considering the difference in salaries . 
  i was only talking about the price of cheap wine . 
   your salaries are twice what we have here which makes it more expensive to produce ... what employees cost has an effect on the final price of a product . 
   best wines in the world are ribera del duero , and my favourite french person agrees with me . 
  [ and how great he looks after spending years drinking them , ] ( http://culturebox.francetvinfo.fr/sites/default/files/assets/images/2014/04/houelle.jpg ) right ? 
   the crudo di parma or crudo san daniele , which are waaay more delicate . 
  funny , my ex is italian and everytime i went to see her family her mom would stuff my bag with food ( i lazily complained , actually salivating already ) . 
  there were different prosciutti and every single time she would show me the san daniele and say it 's `` moooooooooolto dolce '' , 
  i never said they did n't consider themselves culturally related to the peninsula , of course they were and still are . 
  i said they did n't consider themselves to be a part of it , it 's different . 
  a big part of france is culturally related to italy as well . 
   and in case you had n't noticed it 's not like they wanted to be part of the french nation-state , either . 
  i had noticed , no idea why you bring that up since it 's completely irrelevant in what we 're discussing . 
  but they never felt italian . 
  hell , as i said already they rebelled against genoa and proclaimed their independance . 
  that 's pretty clear they did n't and do n't want to be part of italy , the cultural and the nation-state ... 
  how would he disagree ? 
  he died decades before italy unified and went to the british to form an alliance , did you understand what i said ? 
  no idea what cremoa is .

   a substantial part of the french lives perennially obsessed with the uk and the us i 'm not so sure about that . 
  there 's strong appreciation of different aspects of british and american culture , but i 've never remarked on an * obsession * with the day-to-day stuff that 's going on in britain or the us . 
   almost all currency in the world are backed up by the usd . 
  what do you think that means in tangible terms ? 
  that there 's a fixed rate of exchange ? 
  when a currency was backed by the gold standard , the government guaranteed that a unit of that currency could be exchanged for a fixed amount of gold . 
  the usd does n't play that role for any * floating * currency . 
  no , but vermont does n't grant citizenship . 
  if the eu federalises to the extent that troops could be sent into a warzone by the eu parliament , it would make a lot of sense to have those troops be members of a specifically eu army , with a command structure that 's separate from national armies . 
  conceivably the governor of vermont could refuse to send the vermont national guard . 
  there 's no quick and easy solution that 's consistent with the values we seek to defend . 
  anyone got an idea of what percentage of jobs this represents ?

  dubh linn ( dark or black pool ) is the origin of dublin . 
  baile \u00c1tha cliath translates as the `` town of the hurdled ford '' . 
  from what i understand , the black pool was at one point on the river liffey and the ford was less than a kilometre away . 
  dubh linn was the name for the viking settlement , and \u00c1th cliath was where a nearby monastic settlement was established . 
  we kept dublin as a name in english , but because there was a pre-existing irish name it was maintained . 
  i read this a few years back : [ male holocaust survivors lived longer than those who escaped europe ] ( https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2013/09/male-holocaust-survivors-lived-longer-than-those-who-escaped-europe/279462/ ) more generally , it appears that surviving some period of near starvation can have a very positive contribution to longevity . 
  tehran is a serious party town behind closed doors .

   how could the islamists possibly win ? 
  by forcing us to change our society . 
  alright so !,

  he also says that the uk is 20 years into it . 
  the islamists have n't won after 20 years ; they wo n't win in another 20 .

  china 's steel industry expanded massively for years and is unsustainable in the current domestic chinese slowdown . 
  to try to prop it up , china has been selling steel internationally at very low prices - probably below a realistic cost of production . 
  the eu is refusing to play ball because ( 1 ) it will hurt the eu steel industry and ( 2 ) china needs to address the problem of its own excessively large steel production and not push that problem onto world markets .

  is n't poland using some term for calculus ? 
  when i studied this we had the general category of ` calculus ' , that subdivided into ` differentiation ' and ` integration ' . 
  it was a long time ago however . 
  my wife told me about this story . 
  it 's great to see these traditions have been revitalised . 
  she definitely said it to the nurse , who was in tears on live tv . 
  i 'm well aware how callous may is , and how quickly a magic money tree sprouted in norn iron . 
  there 's a user on here / u/trucidator , who was rather proud of the ` magic money tree ' phrase and said that it tested very well in focus groups . 
  have n't seen him post since the election . 
   the mosque is controversial . 
  ms ates has received hundreds of death threats from extremists , mainly from turkey and the arab world . 
  some were sparked by a fake news report on turkish tv , showing pictures of the koran being trodden on in her mosque . 
  in fact , she says , the koran was thrown on the floor and stepped on by the turkish journalists who came to the mosque to film the report . 
  wow , what shitty journalists !, 
  yes , and unfortunately the extremists have the upper hand now because they can simply block any progress in the negotiations and wait for the uk to crash out without a deal . 
  i agree that may bid for autonomy within her own party - a big enough majority that she could plot her own course . 
  do you seriously think the french security forces are n't infiltrating mosques and other muslim groups ? 
  i do n't think it 's that simple . 
  some jihadi groups form around mosques , but some form in prison or elsewhere . 
  some individuals get radicalised on the internet . 
   in custody , he said he wanted to commit `` an attack against a soldier and had been in contact with a member of the jihadist group islamic state who encouraged him to take action , '' a separate source told afp . 
  i sometimes feel sorry for may until i remember her hubris in calling the early election . 
  it seems like she 's trying to find a compromise between the sensible voices like hammond and the scorched earth brexiteers who want to crash out of the eu and bugger the consequences . 
  almost # 800 billion, 
  this is the key point :  the dup should fight for a single market and an open border . 
  for once , it is in a parliamentary position to make a british government listen to it .

  nato or not , we are not going to allow you to invade calais , you 're completely high, 
   solution is for the brits to threaten france by putting their military ahahah fuck no . 
  we are not declaring martial law . 
  and if you mean `` annexing france with the british army '' you 're going to get booted out of my country with just as much strength . 
   until france deports them all . 
  glorious solution for england i 'm sure / s , invading other countries and disappearing anything ( or anyone , including random civis ) that bothers them in other countries in alliances they want to leave anyway . 
  because obviously that 's the glorious way of the futur / s, 
   for instance have you seen any common-eu effort to put some serious pressure on countries like pakistan , algeria , morocco etc that do n't accept their own nationals back even though they ( their nationals ) are not entitled of a refugee status ? 
  that alone would cut the migration flow by 50 % yeah that 's definitely something we should do . 
  say , 30 % of your army get fired on orders from germany . 
  now , the german army wants to take over your borders for you under frontex banner . 
  oh and 1/3 of the army and cops vote/support golden dawn because they think `` the gd is the only party with the guts to hit back germany who stole my pension and greek healthcare and job of our buddies '' . 
  that 's why the refused at the time edit : but it looks like nato patrols could change the situation , and not necessarily in a bad manner, 
   have the hot-spots on turkish soil , identify and register all asylum-applicants and transport them safely across . 
  which would also allow to pick priorities and be the ideal solution ; but we need a stronger agreement with turkey for that annd well possibilities are getting considered right now but ...  what has happened instead , is letting a failed state , the problematic child handle with no planning , with no strategy , with no means and no vision whatsoever one of the greatest problems we have faced as a union . 
  and above all , not official money whatsoever . 
  not even half what they need to run their own country without even any refugees . 
  you can have all the vision you want , if you ca n't fund it because deep recession + externally enforced austerity + constant harassment from the troika + no control over currency ... 
  well i do think it 'd be simpler either way for the foreigners to simply find money either way to subsidize greece so they do n't starve by the millions and do n't vote gd . 
  damn , if only we knew where to find hundreds of billions lying around in some corrupt hands to re allocate . 
  i love ( / s ) how an extreme right wing gang move around to beat random people yet you first start asking why illegal immigrants are illegally there, 
   if gd ever takes power in greece , next morning we are a russian sattelite . 
  except nato wo n't allow such gd state in greece and would make a military coup 20 minutes in if that happen edit : fixed mobile grammar,

    kck and kdp were once very found of each other by the way errrrh . 
  about that : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/iraqi_kurdish_civil_war casualties and losses 8,000 killed oh yeah very friendly with each other / s  why would iraqi kurds had a say on the kirkuk oil in the first place ? 
  because al maliki litterally stole 500 billions $ of their own state money using the baghdad gov 's bank accesses to do so before getting cut out by barzani then later the americans . 
  no state can survive that kind of shock without an external cash flow edit : 500 sorry  and krg was using iraqi money for building themselves a state , again , until al maliki  and are , collaborating with the invaders , lol . 
  they were the only ones that did n't immediately sold their tanks to isis and ran away at 30 ' 000 vs 800 daeshis . 
  if anybody collaborated it 's the iraqis in mosul & ambar big time . 
  but hey i see rewriting historical books is still cool nowadays / s  both parties that you 're mentioning are some corrupt collaborators , some ? 
  billions . 
   the problem is in the areas without a kurdish majority that pyd is taking over . 
  they actually tend to stay out of those ones . 
  there have been a few areas they had to take strategically to destabilize daesh ( the ennemy ) like al hawl , tal abyad , or maybe soon raqqah , but they tend to stay out of those . 
   yeah , and as we know , pyd is not let go any of those regions even after isis is defeated . 
  by the way , it 's the sae thing with the kirkuk actually ... well once again you are mixing pyd and kdp . 
  can you stop that ? 
  it 's like mixing turkey and say greece . 
  yeah they used to be friend , and ? 
   take a look at the syrian ( east ) kurdistan maps , do you really think that pyd is taking those regions for the sake of humanity or for their goals ? 
  no , he 's taking them because he 's missing 900b and they never reappeared . 
   those regions also will be more and more kurdish during the time , that much still appear like a lot of fantasy, 
   naaa , no need to worry , what would they do ? 
  there is little to no consequences for the creditors for not being paid now oh yeah nazi gd greece that plans attacks on turkey , use unlimited false euros supplies , trafick nato military hardware on the blackmarket and does not listen to absolutely anyone in europe and generally start acting like the north koreans what could go wrong / s  other way around consequences for greece would be far worse than just paying - they 're reaching the point where they 're starting to be short on food . 
  i do n't think the troika realize how bad they 're fucking over greece . 
  it 's going to blow up in their faces big time if they pressure anymore . 
   as demonstrated by the fact that some areas under isis control were and are kurdish majority . 
  uh lol . 
  they told all the kurds from a lot of places like raqqah or manbij too to all leave or all get killed one by one . 
  open ethnic cleansing  saying that isis is/was trying to genocide kurds is a blatant lie which demeans true victims of isis genocidal activities , the yazids . 
  one does not preclude the other  please do n't use genocide for political points , you understand they tried to kill the entire city of kobane to the last survivor right ? 
  that 's not `` political points '' . 
   syriza wants to do this by raising the pension contribution instead of lowering pensions . 
  troika does n't accept that because it will lead to further recession and raise unemployment . 
  because obviously citizens who stop consuming ( or having electricity . ), 
  for lack of a income ( due to no pension and no job ) definitely would n't cause a recession / s syriza 's likely right again but ...  also syriza has a very thin parliamentary majority ( 153/300 ) i ca n't shake the feeling the gd will get elected next due to a living too hard in greece for many , [ gd that will stop ( refuse ) paying anything to germany on the spot . 
  ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/greece-debt-crisis-watch-angry-golden-dawn-mp-rip-up-bailout-deal-during-heated-debate-10392791.html ) things are going to get rockier : /, 
   i wonder why hollande is relatively low compared to others western leaders . 
  i guess he makes less noise as a personality than others \\* shrugs * it 's even partly why he got elected after sarkozy i think, 
   by organizations like amnesty international . 
  it 's not like some fairy tails of isis . 
  amnesty took that story because it was relayed by turkish military who relayed it from `` civilians evacuating tel abyad '' , who for some just happened to be isis fighter dropping uniform and running the border . 
  this is how how `` helicopter info '' ends up twisted and on the internet like that , when it 's not willfull propaganda by people who ca n't shake up their view of `` moderates '' who joigned isis . 
   like kirkuk was n't going to happen in iraq ? 
  you might be confusing ( voluntarily ? 
  :-| you sure you are n't taking me for an idiot ? ), 
  the pyd and barzani 's kdp . 
  they 're rivals and absolutely 100 % different gov. 
  the krg is founded on the remnants of the cold war 's cia connection and led by the kdp party . 
  rojava is led by the the pyd ... who are , well , they 're former reds . 
  while both works decently with the americans and signed peace , they still have large political rivaleries . 
  as for barzani ( leader of the kdp ) , he has good relations with turkey and correct relations with baghdad ( under al abadi ) & the rest of iraq i believe . 
  and ( playing the devils ' advocate because i know barzani is hilariously corrupt too but ) the krg mostly made a run for kirkuk 's oil after maliki ( al abadi 's corrupt predecessor ) being the corrupt racist he was started pocketing ( stealing ) the krg 's full share of the state budget for himself using sectarian tensions as a cover & that did put the krg in a serious economical crisis ( late wages etc ) . 
   non-kurdish areas within the kurdish cantons and also the surrounding areas that they managed got their hands in * are to became more and more kurdish anyway * , bullshit . 
  they however did kept political control by integrating the local arabs in the local government . 
   and would be included into the kurdish zone , by any means of force . 
  more fiction i see : they are n't trying very hard against assyrian or arab presence in hasakah or qamishlo for example . 
  of course they are expanding on isis but who would hand back territory to islamonazis that just tried to fully genocide you twice in 2 years ? 
  so they do have sense enough to ( rightly ) appoint pyd-friendly arabs councils instead because anybody would do the same to avoid looking for knives in their back constantly . 
  daesh is not `` just a normal neighbor '' , they need to be dissolved as a group . 
   while they 're cleansing non-kurds from the areas that they 're taking under their control , that one was bullshit spreaded by isis . 
  the ones that went after empty sunni houses where mostly in iraq , mostly yezidi and some peshmerga and they partly got in trouble . 
  the sinjar battlefield definitely had a revenge problem . 
   wanting to enlarge their region into the areas without any kurdish majority ( even hdp expressed their wish for annexing latakia in the syrian kurdish zone ) that bit is true tho but with the war moving they realized latakia was n't a realistically achievable objective ( or was n't worth it ) so it 's never going to happen . 
  now i 'm not saying they 're saints but i 'm pointing out the reasons why they got closer to saa . 
  if you want to integrate people properly you need to do it over time to give them time to acclimatize , learn about the country , the language , what they should do or on the contrary not do , rebuild their life and becoming productive member . 
  too many at once can produce a social shock otherwise . 
  and despite what the press and services says , the problem is less people already there than the fact that the speed rate is * increasing * and some countries in north africa ( hello morrocco ? ), 
  are using it to send abroad ( or let leave ) part of their citizens they ca n't handle . 
   and with the kurdish cooperation with russia and the saa this does n't make turkey very happy . 
  let me build a bit of a timeline . 
  from memory so admittedly a few details like exact order can be fuzzy : - daesh ( islamists ultra radicals ) tries to genocide the kurds in syria . 
  that 's ends up at the battle of kobane . 
  - turkey rumored by some to have helped daesh to try because they dislike the ypg and call them pkk - the saa gave them ammo & weapons no questions asked for collective survival in hasakah/afrin - constant death threats from turkey , random shelling by turkish , multi tons daesh suicide trucks sent from turkey in kobane - ypg still do n't answer back . 
  pkk stand back in cease fire - massacre in suruc where civilians who planned to rebuild kobane got massacred .

   enough to get the people rich out . 
  so a rise of the top rate from 41 % to 45 % ( so to the level of the uk ) and an 2-year long 75 % contribution for the ~ 2000 person who earn more than 1m is enough to get a significant number of people out ? 
   `` the main idea is to make layoffs so expensive for companies that it 's not worth it , '' sapin said in an interview with france info radio there is a difference between firing someone and having a flexible ( but secured ) workforce . 
   there would will be more social housing , and development funds for deprived suburbs well , yeah . 
  the fact that you cut spendings does not mean that you have to cut them everywhere . 
  there is such a thing as a necessary investment . 
   increasing taxes true , but not that much actually . 
   stricter labour laws there are n\u00e9gociations currently going on to introduce more flexibility .

  i restate my doubts : on what legal basis can someone prevent an illegal alien from leaving the country ? 
  well since leaving the country is not illegal ( for illegal immigrant , that is even required ) , i really do not see on what ground the french authorities could act . 
   you can understand the initial motivation for this thread and the subsequent posts put forward speaking for this subthread , was n't it a discussion over the use of `` we want you out '' as opposed to `` i want you out '' which changed nothing to the main point ?

  i 'm pretty sure you will not be arrested for having measured your kid 's heigh in inches . 
  what i meant is that the restriction and tariffs are fairly low compared for other countries ( say , for an extreme example , brazil ) . 
  even if there was a law to  measure everything in metric or face prosecution you are still free to use whatever measurement you want . 
  except not when it involves a contract that your government is supposed to enforce ( as in a sale ) . 
  the eu i far more free-markety than the other major powers though . 
  actually reforms are on the way . 
  there are currently pre-law negotiations ( between workers and businesses unions ) about the flexibility of the workforce . 
  the pensions will be reformed . 
  their are more and more talks about a big fiscal reform . 
  and that is only for the economical/fiscal parts . 
  the left-wing is actually far more likely to reform anything than the right . 
  as for the unions ' power , it is actually quite feeble . 
  they are not really the ones who make a demonstration big or small . 
  their only relevance is that they are the ones the government negotiates with . 
  that is populist to say : `` unemployement will grow during all 2013 '' ? 
  on the other hand , an inability to do any reform would probably cost the country far more . 
  the retirement system will probably be reformed next year . 
  there already have been a reform 3 years ago , which resulted in massive strikes , demonstrations and probably costed sarkozy his reelection . 
  but apparently the reform has been half-assed and tougher measures will need to be taken . 
  i think the unions ' reaction to this will tell if the symbols have been efficient or not ( and when i say unions ' reaction , i mean how they will be able to gather people against it . 
  most people are not unionised and chose whether they want to follow the protest or not ), 
  but was n't that for wealth above 1.5 msvk ? 
  we are talking about a tax on * income * . 
  as for pr , there is a good bit of confirmation bias `` see how ineptly socialist those french are '' . 
  among the french real socialist , where holland is seen as a frontman for the evil capital they look only at the pro-business/cutting spendings measures and not so much at the rest . 
  really that does not matter . 
  with such a huge * assiette * the tax would concern about 1500 taxpayers ( and many of them sportsmen , actors , artists ) . 
  not enough to make a difference , it is only a symbol aimed at keeping to communist calm while having a not-really-leftist policy .

   however , monsieur hollande is eager to live up to his socialist promises , all the egalit\u00e9 he was voted for , and does not shrink the state but instead raises taxes further , lowers the pension age and raises minimum wages http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/09/07/us-france-budget-hollande-idusbre8860qh20120907 and one quote from hollande :  la d\u00e9pense publique atteint 57 % de la richesse nationale . 
  public spendings are now reaching 57 % of the gdp . 
  5 years ago it was 52 % . 
  are we better-off ? 
  there also is an increase in the vat ( which is paid more highly by the poor than the rich ) and some freezing ( like tax tiers or minimal wage that normally follow the inflation ), 
  and sparked a revolution . 
  because it is `` avoiding an exceptional effort in a time when the country faces exceptional difficulties and when everyone else contributes more '', 
  they also do that ( 60bn to be cut in the 2013 's budget ) . 
  actually welfare makes only [ ~ 40 % of it ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/budget_of_france ) ( in france ), 
  as i stated elsewhere , dodging a temporary 75 % marginal rate in a time were your country 's finances need it seems pretty unpatriotic to me .

  a marginal 100 % tax rate would not be `` obviously too much '' . 
  if i use a mathematical ( continuous ) function instead of a tier system for example , i can arrive to a 100 % rate for an absurdly high income . 
  what insult ? 
  the only one i 've heard is `` egoist '' , which is arguably justified . 
  well my bad then . 
  do n't they keep it at home though ? 
  i 'd guess nobody really care if it is a gun you own or something lended to you .

  spain is a sovereign country . 
  do n't you know the country you live in ? 
   a pacted referendum is impossible in spain sucks being in a democracy based on rule of law ... 
   i did n't know scotland was a colony last year . 
  well you should fucking know that ** the central govt agreed to give them the referendum ** . 
  they did n't decide : oh let 's start a referendum by ourselves and the rest of uk can fuck off . 
  the ** uk people ** through their government decided to let scotland have a referendum on the matter . 
  and i dunno if you realise , but you do n't have the same constitution as uk . 
   catalans are actually a majority in catalonia and a minority in spain . 
  do you need everything to be explained to you slowly and steadily ? 
  ca n't you pick up things from context ? 
   that 's the `` self '' part of `` self-determination '' well go check out the law and how experts analyse it . 
  you can legally define a `` self '' and a `` people '' in that particular context if you can prove that in the larger country that you live in you are discriminated against , oppressed , segregated etc etc. 
  go read anyone that has any understanding of how those articles work . 
  if you 're a linguistic minority you do n't suddenly get to ask for independence just cuz . 
  when does it stop ? 
  can a village ask for independence just cuz they have their own language or dialect ? 
  can the spaniards in catalonia ask for independence from catalonia ? 
  ** again ** just because you 're a minority that does n't mean you get independence . 
   that `` minor independence issue '' recognised by the onu as the right to self-determination da fuq you mention again and again an article used for decolonisation ? 
  are you a colony ? 
  in what way can you prove that you are being disenfranchised , discriminated , oppressed by others in spain ? 
  come on give us examples . 
  you cite shit that has no connection with in reality . 
   coersion does n't work . 
  it 's called democracy and rule of law . 
  you are not being coerced . 
  you are simply a minority . 
  you can not ask for independence simply because you are a minority . 
  honestly some people lack logic . 
   you 're proposing that events with 200 , 50 and 3 dead are on the same scale with the terrorism we 're seeing nowadays . 
  so claiming that we 're seeing the death of peaceful europe is kinda ridiculous, 
   that it 's impossible to change the constitution well that sounds like bullshit since your 78 constitution has already been changed before https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/spanish_constitution_of_1978 go to the reform tab to see when . 
   hostile goverment toward us welcome to a democracy based on the rule of law . 
  that means the majority is hostile to your independence grievances . 
  but your rights are about the same as any spaniard so in no way are you discriminated against for being catalan except that minor independence issue  we 'll take this to an international body what international body ? 
  for such an important issue , it amazes me how little you actually know . 
  you sound like a brexiter . 
  use arguments that have no logic in your context , you do n't know the legal process and you ignore the consequences . 
  good luck to you on that  ), 
   wound down by 2000 and for the past 15 years there simply was no mid-to-large-scale conflict in europe , up until euromaidan . 
  the paris riots ? 
  atocha that was the most deadly attack on european soil . 
  london terrorist attacks . 
  it 's just that when you 're a kid , you do n't process it all . 
  you 're in a bubble that bursts later on . 
   you need statistics to know if more people have died in france from terrorist attacks in the last few years ? 
  so before 2012 muslims were perfectly integrated ( much better than uk ( 2005 attack ) and in 2015 it switched ? 
  is that what you 're saying ? 
  that makes sense to you right ? 
  patriotism has nothing to do with comparative feelings . 
  i can be very patriotic but much more muslim . 
   also the whole reason multiculturalism was blamed here was because of terrorist attacks and on that basis france is doing far worse than britain and canada combined . 
  give me statistics or stfu . 
   based on that france 's system is demonstrably worse than britain/canada 's . 
  dude stop spreading bullshit . 
  really . 
  stop . 
  you can not compare muslim immigration in france with the one in uk or canada . 
  uk has muslims from india and pakistan mostly . 
  france from nothern africa . 
  we also have about 80 % more muslims . 
  and canada is just extremely selective about on its migration . 
  7.5 % of french are muslim while 3.9 % canadians are muslim ; and uk 4.5 . 
  if your proof of poor assimilation is well gee look at 'em terrorists attacks , that 's a poor statistic since it is n't representative of basically anything . 
   ( and done far worse compared to the multicultural system in britain and canada ) bullshit . 
  [ here 's a pew poll ] ( http://www.pewresearch.org/files/old-assets/obdeck/50-7.gif ), 
   `` self-determination of nations '' . 
  god man . 
  that does n't work whenever you want . 
  every country in europe has minorities . 
  you can not split everyone just because ` self determination of people '' . 
  you live in a democratic state that is based around the rule of the law . 
  and the ** most important ** rule is the constitution . 
  you can not break it , you can only change it . 
  or you can try and prove that you are an oppressed minority in spain . 
  good luck with that . 
  if you gain unilateral independence you can be certain that france will close its borders with this new non eu country . 
  congratz on winning isolation . 
  you have to respect the law . 
  what agenda is that ? 
  tell me , 
  a list of facts is agenda pushing ? 
  now now ... 
   the europe of my childhood is gone . 
  what was theeurope of your childhood ? 
  the one with the terrorist attacks in london and atocha , the one with nato bombing of serbia , the one with tens of basque terrorist attacks in spain , the one with gia attacks on the rer b and rue des rosiers and the main terrorist khalen kerkal shot in the streets close to lyon , the one with corsican terrorist bombings , the one with srebenica , the one with the balkan war , the one with the northern ireland bombings and those problems , the one with the fear of ussr nuclear bombing , the one with the constant plne hijackings , the one with the raf terrorist attacks , the one with the italian years of lead and red brigades , the one with the italian mafia , munich 72 attacks , oas terrorist attacks and attempt to kill de gaulle i can continue but it would be nice if you told me what childhood so we know when your bloodless childhood was . 
  or each has its own interest . 
  you did n't offer them enough to convince them to give up rights for their citizens . 
  so the british flag on the communist building did n't convice you to stay ? 
  neither did orban 's page ? 
  dayum you people be picky, 
  great . 
  how can i live in a city where i know someone has balls that are 10 ^ 10 times larger than mine . 
  what visegrad asked was not a surprise by any means . 
  less immigration from outside the eu , seconded employees have to be protected , eu countries have to be forced to respect foreign worker rights , more liberal policies and national govts having control over what gets implemented . 
  it 's no surprise at all . 
   no wonder ~ ~ we left . ~ ~ why uk did n't get what it asked for . 
   we could certainly afford to develop and build them if we really wanted to the nuclear dissuasion program costs about 4 billions but that 's considering that we already have all the things in place and initial cost already spent . 
  apparently the trident costs 12 billion .

  i 'm more surprised that their word sounds a bit like the armenian one . 
  in french we used to call beer cervoise , if you read ast\u00e9rix that 's how they call it . 
  although it 's not exactly the same thing from what i understand , other cereals were used than hops back then . 
  anyway , it 's interesting that we have a word that is close to the spanish/portuguese word . 
  han comme tu m ` as vol\u00e9 la vedette . 
  yeah , yeah . 
  what excuse will you find after it happens and the uk does n't collapse ? 
  / r/europe : take all news from granted based on the headline ... 
  except if it 's about brexit not hurting the uk as much as expected . 
  then it 's complete bullshit . 
  does it make sense when we import most of the stuff we use from countries that pollute a lot like china ? 
  basically , we outsourced our energy consumption and pat ourselves on the back . 
  not really . 
  a lot of these villages are virtually unknown outside of their d\u00e9partement . 
  for instance , i posted bouyon because it 's close to where i 'm from , but even people from here would never think of going there for tourism -- it 's just a random village in the mountains , there are hundreds of those . 
  i think what kunstfr meant is that living in a village is n't exactly great in modern times , because you either have to work very far away , or to work at the local supermarket/bakery ... 
  which is why they get more and more empty each year . 
  i did and my next phone wo n't be an iphone for sure . 
  that 's kind of a strawman . 
  they seemed to be really convinced that one of the reason ww1 was lost was that jews were plotting against germany during the war . 
  plenty of people who can write , speak , and sit on a chair believe similar conspiracy theories are true . 
  all of them are from france ? 
  ah damn , i think it 's se\u0301ve\u0301rac - le-cha \u0302teau ... 
  i 'll fix this later . 
  edit : done . 
  i thought london was the 5th biggest french city ? 
  you 're welcome :-), 
  i 'm surprised you did n't pick a place in brittany !, 
  well to be fair i think what we call paprika in french is what they call paprika in english so maybe it 's our fault . 
  and our bell peppers are poivrons !, 
  there are many more nice villages and towns indeed !, 
  [ on this thread on / r/france ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/france/comments/50gvxe/ces_derniers_mois_jai_post%c3%a9_de_nombreuses_images/ ) and [ this one ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/france/comments/4zt9nt/et_si_on_faisait_un_thread_o%c3%b9_on_poste_des_photos/ ) people are posting more pictures , for instance . 
  show us yvoire and samoens :-), 
   why are you using right wing imgur ? 
  well , i tried making an imgur album , but it was uploading all my images in random order . 
  sorting almost 200 images by hand would have taken me forever ... 
  [ yeah , it 's complete bullshit . 
  ] ( http://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/26503/do-african-countries-have-to-pay-a-colonial-tax-to-france ), 
   not really , it 's just the truth . 
  your prudish opinions from another time are the objective truth ? 
   now dress down so i can see that sweet , truly france-representing body . 
  ah yes , of course . 
  the real reason behind all this is that we all want to check out that sweet old arab body !, 
  on a beach where everybody else is mostly naked anyway ... go home , you 're drunk . 
  ah yes . 
  dressing down to how everybody else is dressed is creepy . 
  makes perfect sense . 
  i mean , there are many reasons to disagree with a burkini ban . 
  but disagreeing with it because it 's `` creepy '' is retarded . 
  bullies . 
  til france still has colonies . 
  that 's the thing though . 
  if you think it 's perversion we want you out . 
  pretty sure i 've seen topless women on the beach in cannes recently . 
  or do you mean like , downtown ? 
   generally countries interested a bit about their citizens will take them a reissue them their ids based on existing records . 
  this requires cooperation from the refugees . 
  but of course they do n't want to go back ... 
  so hm , what would you do with them . 
  gas chambers or something ? 
    they destroy their ids so that even their home country wo n't have them back . 
   well that 's not why they do n't want them back . 
  it 's because they do n't want them . 
  if the us can send planeloads of convicted criminals back to salvador or honduras i 'm sure the eu can bully/coerce/bribe somalia or nigeria a bit to take them . 
  well actually it seems to be exactly why they do n't want them back from what i 've read . 
  but who knows who we can believe . 
   french guiana has some much of importance with the spaceport but is big enough to not inconvenience anyone with a camp in the jungle . 
  are you suggesting we send calais migrants to a camp in the middle of the south american tropical forest ? 
  i mean , it 's probably a solution , but given that we get called nazis when we try to ban burkinis , i think if we tried doing that in 2016 we 'd get international sanctions or something similar . 
   the only question is what to do with them after you capture them . 
  are the french waiting for the favorable public opinion ? 
  this is n't a matter of opinion . 
  there is nothing you can do once you capture them . 
  they destroy their ids so that even their home country wo n't have them back . 
  no other country will . 
  if you fly them to some other place in the schengen area , they 'll come back . 
  there is just zero solution . 
  then it matters even less for france ... 
   the french goverment owns 55 % of eurostar while the uk does n't own any share in the company . 
  this argument makes zero sense . 
  do you really think the uk will bankrupt the eurostar and isolate itself from the rest of the eu ? 
  france would only lose easy access to one of its many neighbors , which is pretty negligible in comparison . 
  the uk has everything to lose . 
  i think the point is that if the uk gets the channel tunnel to go bankrupt , they 'll be isolated from the whole eurozone . 
  whereas france will only be isolated from one of its neighbors , which does n't matter nearly as much . 
  so it would be a suicidal move from the uk . 
  this whole argument about france owning eurostar shares that keeps being repeated by british politicians makes zero sense , and i doubt they even believe what they 're saying . 
  the uk would lose a lot more if they were isolated from the rest of the eu than france from the uk . 
  this is kind of a dumb thing to say . 
  are you aware of the milk crisis right now ? 
  the government is n't doing anything , even though farmers complain non-stop . 
  i really think you overestimate how much train exports to the uk matter to france . 
  if the government got rid of the calais jungle they 'd be extremely popular for 95 % of the population . 
  i doubt anyone would care about a few farmers who would be pissed off . 
  not to mention they could probably just use other means of transportation . 
   french farmers will be pissed if they ca n't get their products to us . 
  oh come on . 
  we 're talking about french exports to the uk vs. uk exports to the eurozone ... you 'd be waaaay more isolated/screwed without the eurotunnel than france , which would have no trouble exporting stuff to the rest of the eurozone . 
  the famous hot spots . 
  you should become an advisor to our politicians , they did n't figure it out , i 'm sure they 're waiting for / u/rejerer to show them the magical hot spots .

  as i said but if he want to negotiate he has plan ? 
  or he wants to give the falkland to argentina then `` negotiate '' is just a facade . 
  the same you might condemn the israeli army but not the fatah because it 's their land . 
  guantanamo is on us soil ? 
  or did they negotiate something with cuba ? 
  `` rebellion '' that 's sound like a hyperbole no ? 
  pick one https://www.google.fr/search?q=condition+refugi%c3%a9+hongrois&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=947&amp;source=lnms&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0cayq_auoagovchmik66rprjxxwivrlgach0dvwsb&amp;dpr=1#q=condition+refugi%c3%a9+hongrois&amp;tbm=nws, 
  if he want to negotiate he has a plan right ? 
  we have a independentist movement in guyane https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/mouvement_de_d%c3%a9colonisation_et_d'%c3%a9mancipation_sociale . 
  fun fact the actual minister of justice was part of this movement . 
  but that 's not the same the people who live in falklands are not native or a special ethnicity they are british who come here like what 50 year ago ? 
  what responsability ? 
  well yeah without the waterboarding the torture in general . 
  oh wait that 's a stupid thing to say but i understand people say stupid thing when they are frustrated . 
  what illegal immigrantion ? 
  the migrant go to germany or sweden . 
  so what ? 
  are you afraid you will be invade ? 
  or is it about the malvine ? 
  `` he also attended conferences which supported iraqi action against the west '' no shit when your country got invade you want to strike back . 
  `` wants to negotiate with argentina '' negotiate is good no ? 
  it 's better than sending soldiers . 
  `` he blames the west for tensions with russia '' ok that 's dumb . 
  `` he wants to leave nato and scrap our nuclear weapons along with pretty much reducing our armed forces to something similar to what ireland has '' good . 
  `` he supports hamas '' hamas are still resisting the zionist occupation but yeah they 're reactionnay . 
  `` about jahjah took distance from identity politics and is more operating out of a non-ethnic , secular and leftist framework . '', 
  seems good to me `` gerry adams '' it 's that because of ira ? 
  `` martin mcguinness '' i gues the same ira too ? 
  because i guess this person love free market . 
  a `` true '' leftist is a pathetic for the labour ? 
  i though they were a left party . 
  but if they are like the ps in france then it 's understable . 
  they can always complain about us working in their country . 
  i only undestood yougoslavia . 
  you seem to hate us more http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/features/3634345/30-reasons-why-we-hate-the-french.html, 
  they do n't send us anything they are in a civil war against islamist . 
  find the swede . 
  i 'm not a catholic and i look like more like a arab than a white so probably not ^ ^, 
  i mean immigrant who come in 1960 and who stayed here . 
  i love cheese and i often complain . 
  only / r/france, 
  talking about the grand daughter of mussolini . 
  that depends i will take my personal experience in north of france . 
  i was living in a 20 000 city and they were a lot . 
  it 's because it was a `` mining town '' ( i do n't know if that make sens in english . 
  and a lot of north african come to work in the 50/60 /, 
  or maybe most of us do n't speak english very well . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/russian_national_socialist_party they cut people heads off . 
  there is a documentary on them by a american i think . 
  ( not talking abou the black from the bbc ), 
  where is lorraine :(, 
  honhonhonhonhon but seriously we got 8 % of muslim . 
  hey i am here , 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/radical_nationalism_in_russia seems like neo nazi have evolve as long as you are white and chritstian you are ok . 
  daesh is the arab name if i 'm not wrong . 
   has anarchism flag  complain about refugee please go, 
  that 's not how a civilized society work . 
  he has to be juged and we do n't have the death penalty . 
  i wanted to say this but wow the some syrian refugee look so white . 
  as for the article it 's good to see that some children do n't follow the parent ideology . not like in italia : /, 
  give refugee better condition = / = accepting them in your home . 
  good job really using other people misery to make money . 
  just before you start saying bullshit the man is not a refugee/migrant but a guys who hide among refugee . 
  and for fuck sake isis , isil , daesh stick with on4e . 
  the situation of refugee in hungary is shitty but to compare that with the holocaust is stupid . 
  when i say racist i was talking about a nazi like party who get 16-20 % of vote . 
  i do n't mean anti immigration party like national front or ukip but with the like of anti jew anti gay etc. 
  that 's what i mean by `` welcome '' more social benefit more jobs , less racist population . 
  where did i defend nicolas sarkozy ? 
  and time to time when you take the bus or the train you will get assaulted and stabbed to death . 
  because it 's a poor country . 
  and that muslim get stabbed by neo nazi in moscow . 
  ca n't you at least come up with new maymay ? 
  muslim have been living in monoculture ? 
  in what country ? 
  `` american renaissance ( ar or amren ) is a `` race realist '' website '' no thanks, 
  when you threat people like dogs they are not happy who would 've thought . 
  i look on wikipedia it seems like it 's mostly kurds in iraq . 
  it would be weirds that faction like the ypg would do that . 
  '' i 've seen so many leftist politician completely ignoring facts on that , completely ignoring interviewer questions on criminal rates of immigrants that i have no faith in our own politicians to know what is best for us . '', 
  citation needed `` most non-arabic immigrants are doing fine and do n't cause any trouble , yet arabic immigrants just do n't seem to do well in europe . 
  and i believe our values are just too far apart . '', 
  you really think people will not have problem with black people even if they are christian . 
  yeah let 's take one example about people who are probably not syrian or iraqi refugee and make it sound like it 's the norm . 
  `` at that time '' did the european not always win againt the ottoman ? 
  kurds are more seculars ? . and genital mutilation is not a religious thing but a cultural one . 
  my bad i saw `` the guardian '' . 
  nevermind i saw `` the guardian '' sorry, 
  that was sarcasm . 
  i 'm not a `` ethnic french '' but what does it matter ? 
  i understand care about culture or religion , but ethnicity ? 
  it 's literally only a skin color . 
  why does it matters ? 
  do you think it 's worth it to go to a war just because you do n't want refugee . 
  edit : oh you 're a european mod that explain . 
  do you want a war with libya over refugee ? 
  i do n't think most of them hope for a bmw just for a job and a good life . 
  if refugee go to germany and sweden it 's because other country do n't welcome them ( france the first . ), 
  because our so called `` socialist '' leftist governement threat them like shit . 
  the condition in the `` jungle '' of calais is horrible .

  brexit is n't an invention , we do n't even the full consequences of it . 
  and brexit being a good thing is highly debatable . 
  also puting brexit in the same breath as the telephone or the steam engine is ridiculous . 
  big loser , i tell you folks , he failed bigly . 
  trust me . 
  they failed bigly . 
   europe to want to be a sovereign nation that 's what we want to do mate . 
  also nice grammar . 
  de gaulle was intelligent . 
  how could we translate anschluss in irish ? 
  good strategy . 
  progress is whining about inoffensive words like mankind and gentleman ? 
  you call this progress ? 
  i hope you 're sarcastic . 
  i think the only legit indpendence movement in france , and the only one who actually holds some power is the flc ( front de lib\u00e9ration corse = corsican liberation front ) . 
  as well as every other latin-american country . 
  oh god please no . 
  what does g\u00f6tterfunken means ? 
  it can be fixed with lots of efforts from menber states . 
  and 3 of the biggest economies in the world are still in there . 
  i repeat my question : why do you think the eu is a failure ? 
  no shit sherlock . 
  and why do you think it 's a failure ? 
  why does france , a european country , not belong in the ** european ** union ? 
  marine le pen means frexit , it wo n't destabilise the eu , it will destroy it . 
  are you a eu citizen or not ? 
  and if you are not a eu citizen . 
  why do you want the eu to be disbanded ? 
  since you 're probably not french , why do you care about marine le pen anyway ? 
  hollande can be called by many names , but fascist is n't one . 
  by the way only fillon is fucked ( and rightfully so ) and your precious little marine wo n't drop out . 
  i assume someone will translate it , if i have time friday , i 'll translate a resume of the part of his program dedicated to the eu . 
  speaking of macron he finally has his program ready . 
  it is correct . 
  like your opinion mattered about this ... 
  that 's one thing french shares with norwegian and swedish . 
  i was thinking of that as well . 
  o rly ? 
  yeah ask them if they want to be considered italian ... without being bombed . 
  are we gojng to have these every day ? 
  no need for it , unless a scandal happens . 
  a very ineffective republic . 
  too bad you 'll never have it . 
  yes an antiwar president who wants to augment the us 's military budget . 
  makes a lot of sense . 
  hips be upon her !, 
  that 's a lot of muhameds right there . 
  and he 's finally blonde !, 
  like he always wanted . 
  but you do know that france was a republic before and after the vichy regime , yes ? 
  assuming america is still here . 
  i heard they also drank water !, 
  because there was no nazis between the guillotine and the constitution of france ? 
  salt-right . 
  subtle . 
  carbonis\u00e9 even . 
  kind of the same . 
  no true french patriot would ever see the vichy regime as positive . 
  i view them as traitors . 
  norway and sweden being jdgemental . 
  right he was a millionaire , does n't change the fact that he 's part of the elite . 
  of course just like electing a us billionaire was a backlash against the elite . 
  no not boris , it 's farage !, 
  with everyone talking about grexit , he was interested . 
  why did you say that ? 
  i went there and verified and it 's fucking disggusting . 
  i like that name . 
  a latino satanist speaking japanese . 
  you 're right , but euroskepticism is a very common idea among far-right groups , and generally the european far-right is the part of the european political spectrum , pushing for the death of the eu . 
  hence why euroskepticism is regarded as a far-right position . 
  maybe trump is saying the eu is a wonderful pit overrun by refugees ? 
  i went there , no big thread about it , except 2 or 3 thread with 1-8 comments , some are saying he 's a genius and playing 4d chess , most are confused . 
  try to convince the breton and the corsicans . 
  without being murdered . 
  oh yeah fillon = m\u00e9lenchon , le pen = macron , everyone knows that !, 
  possible things being discussed . 
  i like that , thats new . 
  we 're doing caf\u00e9s of europe . 
  how many dimensions are in this game of chess ? 
  i ca n't , i ca n't , this man is turning me insane . 
  it 's amazing !, 
  glory to the fourth reich !, 
  what is ` this germanized french ? 
  the bigliest mountain . 
  no , because a french citizen is a french citizen , no matter if they 're white , asian , black , arab , latino , etc. . . french blacks and french arabs are n't foreigners in france , they are french . 
  thanks . 
  you do n't need to be of a certain ethnicity to be a french citizen . 
  blacks and arab with french citizenship should n't be considered foreigners . 
  a black or an arab in france should n't be considered `` suspicious '' . 
  and why would they ? 
  i think there 's a xkcd that explains free speech very well . 
  this is heresy !, 
  irish accents for everyone !, 
  nobody 's putting pressure on the police to not control immigrants , the center is not `` far-left '' and you 're way more likely to be interpelled by the police in france if you 're black and arab . 
  you must be kidding me . 
  this ca n't be real , look at his musstache !, 
  oh my god ... 
  i accept the challenge , it will be quick but fun . 
  i propose nigel farage and nicolas sarkozy to activate the buttons so no one of worth will be lost . 
  probably explains the stupidity .

nevermind , i 'm wrong . 
  i thought the bnp paribas $ 9 billion settlement was the biggest bank settlement but it 's not . 
  in 2014 , bank of america was condemned to pay $ 16.65 billion . 
  american companies are not spared i guess . 
  they 'll never pay $ 18 billion . 
  it 's just the maximum fine they could get . 
  yes , fraud is bad , but at least noone died . 
  last week general motors was fined $ 900 million because of a defect tied to ** 174 ** deaths , recalling 2 million cars ... ( [ link ] ( http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/business/wp/2015/09/17/why-general-motors-900-million-fine-for-a-deadly-defect-is-just-a-slap-on-the-wrist/ ) ) vw will be recalling a few hundreds of thousands of vehicles and they will not be treated as kindly because they are a german company . 
  although vw could threaten to cancel their next investment in america too ... 
  what are you talking about ? 
  scotland was able to have a refererendum because westminster allowed it , in accordance with the constitution of the uk . 
  spain is an indivisible nation , its constitution does n't allow one province or one region to decide its fate , which means only a * national * vote can allow catalunya to secede legally . 
  they 'll never be independent unless they 're dumb enough to take arms . 
  the pkk is not blacklisted as a terrorist organization in switzerland , right ? 
  anyone know how swiss authorities answered to these events ? 
  and yet it 's the uk who have a teenage pregnancy problem and the social issues that come with it , according to this [ 2014 study released by the office for national statistics ] ( http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/vsob1/births-by-area-of-usual-residence-of-mother--england-and-wales/2012/sty-international-comparisons-of-teenage-pregnancy.html ) . 
  i do n't know enough about the situation in ireland or the uk to tell whether it 's caused by conservative and religious mindsets or by a disadvantaged background . 
  maybe ireland is still quite socially conservative relative to the rest of europe . 
  however , it 's good to see that they have come a long way since [ the girl in the grotto ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ann_lovett ) . 
  perhaps you guys can tell us how much things have changed and whether the reputation of ireland as a socially conservative society ( no talking about laws here ) is still fair . 
  i have to admit , i kind of missed those `` man angry at satirical cartoons '' articles . 
  the cartoons address a certain audience that does not need to be constantly reminded that the authors are in fact exposing hypocrisy or social issues . 
  good thing it does not matter how revolted people are and that they are protected by the law . 
  no it 's not , it 's the truth . 
  there 's no excuse for the situation some labour unions put people ( french and foreigners alike ) into . 
  but i guess whenever you want something from the french government you can just go and block all means of transportation and get away with it . 
  just because you do n't speak french does n't mean you wo n't enjoy your time here . 
  english is enough to enjoy restaurants , landmarks , hikes , museums etc. 
  honestly if i were planning my holidays in france i 'd be more worried about prices and strikes . 
  incidentally the best holidays i ever had was in andaluc\u00eda . 
  i did n't speak english or spanish fluently at the time but some of the hotel staff spoke french . 
  that was my only way of getting information to plan my stay and trying to communicate with locals -- who still managed to help me despite the language barriers -- was one of the reasons why i had a blast . 
  the french * generally * do n't speak english well enough to have a conversation with a native . 
  this is especially true with the older generations and it has nothing to do with pride . 
  the only european countries with a worse english proficiency than france 's are russia , ukraine and turkey , according to the ef english proficiency index . 
  i agree it 's a shame for the tourist industry if their workers ca n't speak english , but this is not some conspiracy to piss off foreigners . 
  every language seems obsolete when you compare them to english . 
  i feel very lucky i can speak to lots of tunisians , algerians , moroccans , malians , swiss , belgians , canadians , etc. 
  it 's still a global language . 
  i 'm not proud of it , i 'm just saying it is still very useful . 
  wait , should we be sorry the french always insist to use their own language in institutions that * allow * it ? 
  maybe on a few occasions french public speakers decided they wanted to piss off foreigners , but it 's mostly because they feel more comfortable addressing an audience in their mother tongue .

  even / r/france could not care less ... 
  the puerta del sol plaza in madrid might be spain 's most popular plaza . 
  puerta del sol literally means `` the sun 's gates '' and just like the sun is the center of our system , it 's located at the exact center of the country relative to its roads .

   how does france come to terms with the terror and the things that happened before the thermidorian coup when celebrating bastille day ? 
  it 's simple . 
  the current situation is a result of more than a century of republican propaganda . 
  today however i 'd say most people are aware that most revolutionaries were either deluded , power-hungry scum or masses of common folk who were unable to feed their children . 
  for the sake of brevity , the terror and jacobin ideas nevertheless had a huge impact on the exercise of power in france . 
  that 's why even today the ideas of centralisation and egalitarianism have such an influence in france . 
  i totally understand your point of view as there 's a world of difference between the english glorious revolution or the american revolution on the one hand and the advent of the french democratic state on the other hand . 
  bastille day is supposed to be a celebration of liberty and union but i feel like it 's actually a celebration of the power of the state . 
  i never thought that watching aggressive people get their asses kicked would be so satisfying . 
  this is preposterous . 
  the greek officials are the ones blackmailing the rest of the eurozone . 
  `` well , well , well ... 
  it 's a nice monetary union you 've got here . 
  it 'd be a shame if something happened to it . '', 
  too soon man . . 
  my gues is that because for some reason the earth implodes . 
  that 's not a very reassuring thought . 
  honestly i would n't be surprised if he did like it . 
  bin laden was one of the funniest characters on this show . 
  he was n't portrayed as completely stupid or irrelevant like some politicians were ; he was just portrayed as a ruthless man with a very dark sense of humour . 
  my university used ubuntu for every single computer . 
  it 's the exact same thing as windows . 
  you log in , and the desktop already has all the shortcuts most people need : libreoffice and a browser . 
  librarians are available if you need help but there are signs that explain the basics . 
  the same thing would happen with computer running windows anyway . 
  the differences between windows and ubuntu are huge , but do n't matter at all when you just want to browse the web and write a paper . 
   i think the elephant in the room is : do we want a federal europe ? 
  are we working in that direction ? 
  if not , what is the political end game here ? 
  we just seem to be either kicking the can down the road in making that decision , or drunkenly stumbling in the darkness towards it . 
  i agree that something just does n't make sense here . 
  on the one end , the institutions were built to always tend towards more integration , but on the other hand noone knows how a european army would work or how a european fiscal policy would work and there 's just no actual popular support for these things . 
   should n't we be more to each other by now ? 
  should n't i as a dutchman care about the falklands , because the british do ? 
  for some of us , national or regional identities mean nothing.i 'm an individual and i identify with other people based on their values and their actions , not their nationality . 
  i see no reason why i should care more about a german or a british person than i would for a japanese or a vietnamese . 
  if people care more about their neighbours , it 's often in their own self-interest , not because of identity . 
  * edit : i just wanted to add that that does n't mean i do n't care about other europeans . 
  i do , but not just because their close and they happen to havebeen born on the same continent . 
  * in my case i do n't want a huge , centralized , european yet foreign state to replace my own centralized government , especially if the only purpose is to counter american hegemony . 
  if you want to get rid of bureaucracy , we 'll need to get rid of entire institutions and strip them of their powers . 
  this means huge deregulation and more decentralization with the principle of subsidiarity at the heart of european reforms .

  i do n't want to mention the war so instead i 'll go with the publication of the [ * encyclop\u00e9die * ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/encyclop%c3%a9die ) . 
  i know it 'll sound really cheesy but in my eyes it represents the slow and gradual transition from a society dominated by dogma and fear of nature to a society built around reason and the study of natural sciences . 
  it 's supposed to protect * das deutsche volk * , so it has to look strong .

  if it was opened on the other side of the country people simply would n't go there in the same numbers . 
  sangatte was ( abusively ? ), 
  closed which led to the current jungle and a lot of uk screams . 
  now we try inching toward closing the jungle & reopening a proper sangatte housing camp and you complain of it too ? 
   .  besides , having refugees filling paperwork for a place in the new sangatte would help documenting them a bit too .

  there 's going to be a lot of luck involved in that sorry , but there are definitely worse places than even the poorest zones of europe, 
  okay , that might actually have been a bit wrong ( and wrong on my part for supporting it before ) .

  some might be younger and gone elsewhere for a variety of reasons, 
   it does n't matter who those people are or where they come from .

  any silence does nothing but harm the victims . 
  100 % agreed . 
  do n't cover for actual criminals , if possible help pushing their arrest . 
  the less criminals walking around free , the better for everyone, 
  ca n't they try recruiting former cops as a fill in for the moment ? 
  there has to be some that were n't kicked out for serious stuff and could be enticed back with a better paycheck and 2 week updating crash course, 
  by definition , justice is blind and does not discriminate based on your skin color , name or origin . 
  the second you decide the law do n't apply to people you do n't like is the day you go on a path where you will open guantanamos . 
  europe 's rich enough to afford proper prisons . 
  i think the cdu has been in power in germany for a long time ( and democratically ) ? 
  they can probably afford to think long term , no ? 
  i always assumed it was one of the great strengths of the german gov 's lucky stability . 
   sure but money is the issue here supplementary police wage funds could be coming from the refugee crisis emergency funds, 
  but they would because they would save money vis \u00e0 vis doing damage control ( which is a lot costlier ) . 
  i guess they could recruit a bit more and pay officers a bit more to attract a lot more while keeping standards . 
  that 's a bit more money but cheaper than tossing dozens million worth of ressources at every scandal incoming :\\, 
  europe does not apply the death penalty on prisonners . 
  ... i do n't think we heard much demands from danemark to leave the eu ... 
  yeah right . 
  check out the ages there : http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/eureferendum/12050930/eu-referendum-who-are-britains-inners-and-outers.html and especially the `` should uk remain in the eu or leave ? 
  by working status '' . 
  all the retirees that want to leave to kick out `` the foreigners '' but want to keep the exact same rights for themselves in france . 
  and most of the uk immigrants are old geezers who will likely never work a day in their life here either way . 
  so i find it pretty ironic that they argue the rest of the eu leech on them . 
  they want to close all borders to the eu ( especially cutting them welfare ) but they want a nice cheap house & welfare in other eu countries . 
  edit : just for the records , i 'd support giving blanket residency to english citizens that have been in france 2 + years and/or working citizens or students ( people who can justify an activity ) , or have family/relatives there , or own a home , if the uk leave . 
  but i ca n't help but point out the cognitive dissonance some of the leave voter goes throught . 
  i think it 's hilarious . 
  they all want to leave the eu in mass because they dislike `` france encroaching on our sovereignty '' and paying taxes and lazy non working dirty eu foreigners immigrants doing nothing but who steals all our jerbs and welfare ; but the second people stop looking they all immigrate here for their rainy days and start asking for welfare and state paid healthcare . 
  ... what ? 
  your posts are more and more confused . 
  are you drunk ? 
   mouthbreathing hyperbole !, 
  so you advocate abolishing/ignoring human rights for people you do n't like ( quoting : '' * `` and no doubt they would be executed by those regimes . 
  i do not see that we have an obligation to protect their rights '' * '' or '' * i do not think that european nations have any obligation to stand up for the rights of people * '' ) and i 'm the one `` mouthbreating hyperbole '' ? 
  you 'd make a damn fine republican politician if you can keep your hypocritic lying at that level  you might as well just have said `` fuck you '' well then i will : fuck you for thinking human rights are optional , especially in europe where we can easily afford them ( because if anyone really can easily on earth it 's us . ), 
   because that 's all your idiocy amounts to . 
  ah yes when you have nothing to say just call the other guy an idiot, 
  and this is definitely a problem, 
  is it worse than mixing them with the general pop and watch them triple the wannabe jihadi headcount ? 
  i do have to admit something like it crossed my mind , but they 'll never be trusted with a gun so no `` as in '' . 
  i think we might have to do more than question our immigration policies in europe . 
  probably revise them heavily . 
  by closing the borders and picking from refugees camps in turkey & morroco & such & possibly even deporting back a number of them starting by identified economic migrants & from problematic origin zone when possible : / ( with a possible caveat for educated citizens ), 
  generally when you get life you get released after 20 years most of the time , unless we can prove exceptional crimes like if you were dumb enough to film yourself beheading people or if you were a serial rapist caught with proofs or you go the breivik psycho way . 
   there are enough people that they are essentially a fungible commodity . 
  ah yes , quoting joseph staline . 
  just what we needed . 
   but i would support extraditing them to the regimes against which they committed their crimes which , in iraq case , is just a nice way to let somebody else press the button and telling your own population you have nothing to do with their execution since you did n't pressed the trigger yourself you left it to the iraqi henchmen . 
  really . 
  so when the mafia boss order a hundred hits you think he 's innocent then ? 
   i do not see that we have an obligation to protect their rights in these specific cases , careful , that 's how it started in the usa with 09/11 . 
   we are proposing putting people in jail for something they did abroad , but we already have laws in place for that , as we do for joining foreign fighting forces . 
  but we do not apply them because we are refusing to treat muslims as equals , well we should apply them . 
  and including the part about not extrading people that will certainly be executed that you do n't like about . 
   we should treat someone who fought in the jihad exactly as we would someone who joined any other rebel group . 
  lol , that 's ridiculous . 
  you have obviously no idea what you are talking about . 
  you ca n't treat everyone who had a gun in their hands in their life like every members of the daesh mass rapists apocalyptic death cultists . 
   in short , i do not think that european nations have any obligation to stand up for the rights of people who reject those rights , well do n't forgot to send us a postcard from your next holidays in guantanamo then i guess ? 
   i believe taking them in and even putting them in prison here will make us a base for terrorist activity worldwide . 
  our own soft policy would be directly responsible for terrorism , domestic and abroad . 
  aka war on terror 3.0 . 
  people like you never learn , do they ? 
   being soft on jihadi 's sends the signal that we are weak i 'm sorry , being busy razing them to the ground in syria/iraq since 2 years is n't enough for you ? 
  * for fuck 's sake * . 
   i have even seen a professor at a university have a seminar about how bataclan was our fault for being `` racist '' against muslims !, 
  ah yes because one idiot made an idiot point we should all litterally start another war on terror ? 
  what the fuck ? 
   these people also exist in an uncomfortable limbo between supporting terrorism and condemning it `` if you do n't agree with me you are against us and litterally a terrorist from al quaeda ! '', 
  what the fuck man \u00b2 ? 
  thieves do n't try radicalizing other big time . 
  i only suggest proper jail conditions , not setting them free . 
  ie separate wing + proper rehabilitation program after ( or during , of course ) the jail time . 
  it 's not a pass around jail , of course . 
   regretably , in this case . 
  oh you would rather be in an occidental country with death penalty ? 
  no issue , america 's that way . 
  you just need to show up a biometric passeport to pass the border , no need for a visa . 
  here 's your plane ticket and 100 $ for the road, 
  europe proper is n't at war .

  there are still french interests in the region , but yeah , mali itself has little to offer . 
  here 's the main thing you do n't seem to understand : i 'm not disputing the explanations which you give as facts ( of which some are , some can be argued ) , i 'm telling you why you 're downvoted ( which by the way , is n't that much the case . . ) : not because of your opinions , but because your phrasing is basically rude . 
   what disdainful comments ? 
  you keep saying that but have yet to point anything out ok , here we go :  this makes them pro-eu-everything by default and they 're also very young which makes them idealistic  we generally get downvoted for holding opinions contrary to the hive mind  every downvote i get and every upvote you get on this thread just further proves my point to the op you may deny it , but those comments do pass off as being quite disdainful . 
  as for me voting for a eurosceptic party , i am critical of eu institutions and how things are dealt with and i have expressed that on reddit from time to time . 
  i would wish for a different kind of european alliance , and ultimately , i 'm not against federalization if it 's not to the detriment of my country . 
  no , it does n't prove your point , you 're just continuing with your disdainful comments and people do n't like that . 
  people may downvote on subreddits ' inclinations because they do n't feel it 's true , maybe they do n't see themselves in what the person is describing . 
  ps : i vote for a eurosceptic party in my country . 
  maybe you get downvoted not for your opinions but because , based on this comment alone , you 're somewhat insulting and dismissive . 
  damn , if they go through with it they 'll beat our franco-rosbif tunnel record !, 
  i hope it does n't happen !, 
  ( joking . . ), 
  well , considering they 're on the [ other side of the caucasus mountains ] ( http://www.freeworldmaps.net/asia/caucasus/caucasus-map.jpg ) ( except for a small area in the north east ) , not really . 
  that web page is well done . 
  i did n't read it though . . too late for this , but i 'll come back to it :p, 
   we said no to napoleon bonaparte and his flattery and history has proved us right san marino : napoleon 's bane . 
  i suggest they vote with the closest italian region . 
  though either of the two may not like that , it is ridiculous for 30,000 people to get 6 meps . 
  that 's one representative for every 5,000 people . 
  each mep could actually meet all of their electors :p, 
  an alternative would be that their votes are integrated in the mep election of the italian region they neighbor ... that is , if the italians do n't mind . 
  but 30,000 people added to an entire italian region would n't change much for the italians . 
  i mean , san marino is highly integrated into the economy of the italian region it neighbors , and italy takes care of san marino 's military , and probably it 's foreign policy in some way . 
  well the 1848 revolutions , called the `` springtime of the peoples '' , although mostly unsuccessful are regarded as great and influential movements for freedom . 
  i agree . 
  i was responding to comment which was n't about this though . 
   population : 32,448 ( july 2013 est. ), 
   registered voters : 33,303 ( november 2012 ) what ? 
  do they not have any minors in san marino ? 
  and the ideas of the french revolution , which are generally considered to be progressive , included nationalism , and that nationalism helped spread the ideas of the revolution , which eventually culminated in the 1848 revolutions in europe . 
  his approval rating was already very low , now even the left wing ( who are the only ones who disapprove of hollande 's dealings with the roma ) criticize him . 
  please do n't call it freedom cheese . 
  ever since some americans used the `` freedom '' adjective for food it just sounds stupid . 
   the night before , european parliament president martin schulz gave a speech at a memorial to the battle warning of a resurgence of nationalism . 
  this seemed kind of random . 
  because it was newly found nationalism in the states napoleon conquered which eventually allowed them to defeat him . 
  actually , it has been shown that many of the foreign rebels in mali were mercenaries for qaddafi , not against . 
  it is true that once they lost their `` job '' with qaddafi , they needed another place to fight ... 
  but regardless , what was done was done . 
  one ca n't blame the french or anyone else for there being hardcore islamists in the world . 
  your argument is invalid . 
  and anyway , the intervention in mali was successful , and showed the islamist world which was getting too bold that they ca n't just take over anywhere . 
  to be honest , i 'm not `` pretty sure '' , it 's just always what i gathered , but coming to think about it , there probably still is this taboo in european governments to maintain the ban . 
  i ca n't really search google for more info , cause i 'm at work and ca n't really go off investigating stuff right now :p, 
  france asked for other european countries to participate with soldiers , but only got some logistical support . 
  i 'm pretty sure it 's mostly the us enforcing the ban on germany and italy from developping their army more . 
  regardless , i 'm all for lifting the ban , and i highly doubt france or any other eu country would be worried of germany or italy having a larger force , considering the possibility of a war between western european countries seems impossible in any near future . 
   you might discover that those two countries are , in fact , european . 
  he surely knows that , but i 'll just add this : i 'm getting pretty sick of the rest of europe relying on only the uk and france to represent the eu militarily . 
  every eu country needs to chip in . 
  interventions like mali were highly important for european interests for example , france ( and the uk ) should n't be expected to do everything when it 's our common interest . 
  you could couch surf for the half-month . 
  just throwing in that suggestion here . 
  so you do n't need to pay for a full month of housing although you 're just staying half a month . 
  there 's a beautiful park in paris called luxembourg  ( or `` jardin du luxembourg '' ) . 
  but my description was very general , the chances were very slim :p, 
   in my youth ( a long time ago ) i participated in a couple of strikes while at school . 
  as / u/foxkilt says , it was a fun day out with no class . 
  exactly . 
  me too . 
  i remember our school teachers even encouraging us to skip class to go to this or that protest . 
  well , there are other quality papers , like le figaro , le parisien for example . 
  le monde is good , but it 's a left wing paper . 
  not that it 's a bad thing , but it 's simply not representative . 
  the idea is good . 
  maybe it should be impartial and translate good articles from all newspapers , not just the left-wing ones . 
  i kind of want to say , le monde is n't the only serious newspaper in france . 
  i do n't know about `` p\u00f8lse '' , or what it is , but yeah , otherwise in paris it 's pretty much the same thing . 
  when i have a girlfriend though , when we 're drunk , i also like to munch on other things  ( sorry for the douchebaggery ) . 
  sometimes drunk people will jump in , but it 's not advised . 
  it 's not radioactive or anything , it 's just dirty enough to not want to swim in it . 
  obviously , there are laws against polluting the waters and such , but i 'm guessing it will take much more for the river , once it gets to paris , to be deemed clean enough to swim in . 
  i mean , the sources which eventually form the seine river in paris go through a lot of industrial areas in northern france . 
  damn , i did n't get it at first and was wondering what cars and the banks of the seine had to do with the french revolution . 
  :p nice one . 
  before he was elected in 1995 or something , chirac promised the seine river would be so clean he 'd swim in it ... 
  empty politician promises  it would be awesome though if in summer people could go out for a swim in a crystal clear seine . 
  no , it 's great in paris ( which is why one does n't need a car in paris ) and it 's okay in some suburbs . 
  but there are still suburbs which are difficult to reach through public transportation , and thus people living there need a car . 
  as paris is getting more and more inaccessible by car ( with these kinds of projects , expensive parking space , rare parking space ... ) it 's disadvantageous for those who already live in remote areas of the paris region and work in paris . 
  what they can do is drive to another suburb where there is public transportation to paris . 
  it 's still a hassle . 
  another example of how space exploration helps develop technologies which can be useful in our everyday lives . 
  motorists have another reason to be pissed off . 
  thing is , one does n't really need a car in paris , however , it does n't help people from the suburbs who work in paris and have bad public transportation from their area ( they ca n't work without a car ) . 
  i 'm still all for this kind of thing . 
  `` protests '' is the key word . 
  there are n't any massive protests against the government , as there were when sarkozy was president . 
  it 's kind of annoying to have to answer to this kind of comment . 
  please read thoroughly next time . 
  ok , this is harsh , brutal , insensitive and whatnot . 
  i 'm not trying to be sarcastic , i 'm serious . 
  this is quite hardcore . 
  but fuck it . 
  there are laws . 
  immigration laws . 
  and they exist for a reason . 
  hundreds of thousands of people immigrate legally , it often costs them a lot of money , it 's often difficult for them . 
  furthermore , i 'm willing to bet at least a billion people in the world would be happy to live in france , or any other western european country if they were given the opportunity .

  both politicmen , but also voters . 
  i think the same system can turn very well in a country , and become a nightmare in an other . 
  education culture and personnal responsability are crucial . 
  these day are stranger and stranger, 
  merkel, 
  human right activist from yemen . 
  this could also be a cover for someone founding the terorrists , and while it may also not be the case , it is normal to check it . 
  moreover , considering how there is no death penalty in uk , i dont see how an anti death penalty ngo could be targeted by the goverenement for their activity . 
  then we can rebuild her , we have the technology . 
  we have the capability to build the world 's first bionic politic woman . 
  angela merkel will be that women . 
  better , stronger ... and thriftier . 
  because their economy is still working , and seing how the other european leader with all their nice theories are failling hard , it is logical to see merkel as an efficient leader . 
  after i tried german , english seemed incredibly easy . 
  at least to write simple sentences . 
  using irregular and prepositional verbs and complicates sentences are more difficult . 
  especially future since its different from the french . 
  for the spoken english ... well why bother , as each commonwealth nation has its own pronunciation , lets just speak globish , in a way every non native can understand , and let the english 's ears burn . 
  well , the footage of this incident was released . 
  it remind me of this http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1lynvx/french_consulate_worker_arrested_at_israeli/, 
  well , i think that during the byzantine and roman empire , they were a part of europe , but the whole mediterranea was a part of europe at this time . 
  but today , they are not , and while their secularism did offer some prosepct of a european-turkish cooperation , their current trend to islamism is burning all the bridges . 
  actually , it does . 
  you can complain about some clouds in european press , but in iran , its nighttime . 
  italian politician living up to their reputation, 
  what if one eu country did suddenly adopt a communist or fascist governement and started to apply very repressive policies that revulsed the others ? 
  even if it would offer better condition , i doubt that any former colony would choose to integrate its former colonist . 
  maybe some islands would find interest in it , but a whole african country ? 
  not likely . 
  i dont think that any african country would be willing to go back to europena rule , but if it was the case , yes , we would be able to get away with it . 
  making them reach european level would however be a lot more difficult . 
  especially with today liberals ( as opposed to conservatives ) values . 
  in france , mayotte is still underdevelloped . 
  i thought you were a country already ? 
  sorry , mixed the french and castellano writings . 
  by the way , its catalonha in occitan . 
  catalognia is the most serious independentist movement in western europe . 
  while baque and corsican independantist are more decried as they are violent , catalogna managed to build instead of destroying , and has currently a wide popular basis . 
  moreover , an independant catalogna would be a viable state . 
  i would support it . 
   they could offer help to the neighbouring countries in patrolling the borders and limit weapons etc. 
  getting into syria they are already offering protection to turkey and jordania , but they cant control the sea shipement . 
   it 's worth noting that the results of if syria even used chemical weapons are n't even in yet . 
  thus far all we have are rumours . 
  we should remember from iraq what happens if usa jumps the gun . 
  i believe all the evidence so far show that a large scale chemical strike did indeed occur , and that assad is the only one with the mean to do that . 
  its time to cut the crap and talk about the actual facts , and not this bullshit russian porpaganda . 
  well , its out of date . 
  putin said such resolution was unnaceptable . 
  he want to give assad a nice noncoercitive notice that he sould relinquish its weapons , thats all . 
  i wont favor taking side on the syrian civil war as both side are bad , but when obama did warn assad not to use its chemical arsenal , i thought it was a good idea to prevent heavyer civilian causalities . 
  however , now that they have been used , he need to act to keep his word , and i would support it . 
  if assad will to relinquish its weapons , though this would be pointless , but i doubt assad is of goodwill here . 
  he is probably just buying time , but lets give him a week to have these chemical rounded . 
  that it is the colder petromonarchy in the world considering they have a king ... and petrol ... you know ... 
  seriously , they have actually a lot of islands . 
  actually , my comment was an the relaibility and bais of the person making the statement . 
  eating the skin of an apple is ` healthy ' - my grandmother, 
  italian and english . 
  considering how italian politician are seldom condemned , i say it is a safe move for them . 
  / u/hellomondays reported that this was not taken in the last day , but in a previous attack . 
   if we do n't act we will be hated . 
  if we do act we 'll be hated . 
  fuck all of that shit . 
  if we 're going to lose either way i say we keep our money and stop sending my generation to die in a fucking desert . 
  you got it right and wrong at the same time . 
  you are not hated because of what you do or dont do , but because there is an other side which is maintaining a propaganda war . 
  yeah , propaganda work both way , and if the arab street is told each day how evil you are for what you do or dont do , you should not question your actions , but who is actually playing the mob . 
  russia will be pissed , and i enjoy that , but china will stay out of the affair to protects its future commercial relations with any syrian state, 
  it will probably be more like libya though . 
  oh , and we should wait for the un observer , because they are basically hostages . 
  one often neglected advantage is the end of the inflation race . 
  usually in france , we sufffered an heavy inflation ( till 10 % per year ) , and hence a lot of people bought houses and the house market was all wrecked . 
  other invested aboard or fled to switzerland ( to evade tax in the same time ) . 
  then , poor people could n't afford to escape inflation , while the rich used solutions that harmed us . 
  with a stable currency , life is a little better . 
   many communists would argue all capitalistic countries are single party , since every party is interested in maintaining bourgeois capitalism . 
  thats just show how retarded they are . 
  it is the same as the far far right claiming all other parties are the same as they are anti-nazi . 
   when i met an italian and said they were from italy and i replied ohh i live in slovenia i get 3 responses ( `` wheres that '' `` oh slovakia '' or a blank expression ) ouch !, 
  on the subject , i think that flemishs think to high of themselves , and can be pretty stuborn with their wallons neighbours . 
  when you try to speak in french to them , they insist on speaking their obscure dutch-like dialect ( dutch being already a german dialect ) and you end speaking in english ( even if they do speak french ) . 
  swiss irritate me a lot too , because they speak bad of the french in every occasion , and are a tax heaven . 
  yeah , our economy is failling , unemployement is high , but no worries , we have still large patchs of unadultered nature to frolic in !, 
  thats political terrorism at its finest . 
  d\u00e9fricher is more an agricultural term , meaning you remove trees to have a clear field , i dont think its related to people , but really to agronomical devellopement of africa , as its next sentence is `` making the desert fruitfull '' . 
  both are interesting . 
  switzerland provide more benefits , and is a wealthier , but you will have a better social life in germany as the swiss are sometime reclusive . 
  taxi wasnot his finest work . 
  but luc besson films were really good . 
  nikita ; leon ; the fifth elements ; were really a boost for frenchs films . 
  well , we should promote a good and interresting film industry to begin with . 
  french has a somehow medium film industry , but still try to promote films that are both consensual and not commercial . 
  we should instead make innovative but pleasing films . 
  i 'll be less conclusive than martelfirst , but there is a lot of doubt on this affair for many reason . 
  `` light scratch marks '' and no bruises . 
  although she said the agression happened in a park , and that she was helped by someone , there is still no witness . 
  considering how this did hit the news , i find it higly unlikely . 
  some young girl that decide to wear a burka in public to show everyone they defy our custom and law are aw . 
  given the local context , with the violence in trappes and the military who was arrested for planing an attack on a mosquee , it is plausible that she did want to stick to the news by making this story .

well it 's free and not too cold . 
  norse countries are also free . 
  in france it also might be but it wo n't be in english !, 
  do n't worry buddy , do n't invest in universities , spend your money on fun and go study for free in germany, 
  in france we pay as much tax and we 're light years from those services . 
  we had the same problems with refugees from afghanistan in my school , you scored against him in football and you got beat up . 
  we never had those kind of troubles with refugees from ivory coast , probably because they were the one beating us at football . 
  i 'm just going to state some facts , no opinion : lobbying is great because our members of the parliament can not be expert in all the things they are voting , the lobbyist brings them some expertise in technical fields so that the parliamentarians can know what they are voting for . 
  lobbying is bad because our members of the parliament can be influenced more by the richer and more powerful lobby , sometimes against what is right . 
  also 33 % of those who think that a brexit would be bad for the english economy want them to leave . 
  we are great . 
  their communication is indeed really bad , we always have the feeling that we do n't have our words in the debate . 
  they do not try to communicate on why they do things and how they can and have improved our lives so that leaves a big vacuum for the populist to say a bunch of bullshits that pleases the people . 
  if they just spent a bit more time saying `` we set up new regulations for banks that will avoid you losing your money '' i 'm sure people will like it . 
  i think that integration should be like in the us , but with a weaker federal government , more about only stating the basic principles of the law , taking care of the defense and the money ( they already have the money ) and the countries could after legislate on the rest , a bit like the states in the us have different laws . 
  a funny thing when i lived in south carolina on the border with georgia , bikers were stopping in the middle of a bridge to wear a helmet that was required in georgia but not in sc . 
  however , i do n't see any future for myself in france , i do not speak any other language than english and french and i refuse to go live in england so i think i 'll go to the us . 
  i do not like the path the eu and my country are taking . 
  that 's sad but when i see that my friends who have degree can not find a job while they are looking in the entire country ( and france is big ) , that makes me think it 's time to move . 
  do n't worry , i 've got mononucleosis so i 'm stuck at home with nothing to do , no appetite and i barely sleep at night , so i 'm always happy to help !, 
  yeah , the euro is also a political move as it 's a step toward a bigger integration of all the countries in the eu . 
  nevertheless i think that it 's a good thing , the life was easy when we were the most developed countries , but now the world is developed , we have to compete with them , do you really think the little belgium could do anything against a giant like china ? 
  probably they could n't , but a union of 22 small or medium sized rich countries could do something . 
  that 's political , but beneficial !, 
  see texas , that 's why everybody is afraid of you and do n't want to go to playdate with you, 
  you ca n't see the benefits if you were not really involved in international trades before the economic and monetary union . 
  to give you an idea , between 1995 and 2012 trades between the country of the eurozone has been multiplied by 2,3 . 
  in the world , the volume of all the trades has been multiplied by 2,5 , more than in the eurozone but you must consider that it was the period of growth of countries like china and other emerging countries that were really behind us , so it allowed us to keep the pace . 
  between 2000 and 2006 , the trades among the country of the eurozone grew by 88 % , while the trade with the uk by only 55 % on the same period . 
  [ source in french ] ( http://www.bsi-economics.org/400-commerce-intra-zone-bilan ) also , you must be careful with the comparisons with other countries , if you compare to an emerging country then they will always have a better growth than us . 
  now we did n't do good because of the financial crisis ( whose greece was the trigger ) , the ecb is trying everything they can to give incentives to banks to loan money , but in the same time they increased the regulations on the banking sector . 
  it 's good for the future financial stability but those new regulations required banks to secures a bigger part of the money they had ( kind of , it 's hard to explain ) , they can not use that money to loan to companies or people , they must keep it in case of a crisis , so basically they can not loan as much as before . 
  also , there are the economic policies of each country , hell we elected a socialist president , it costs almost 20 $ an hour to employ a guy on the minimum wage here so it does n't necessarily helps us . 
  i know that the eu seems distant and useless , but it 's actually working , you can get your licence in erasmus university , then a master in sciences po and then a doctorate in bocconi universita , that alone is an outstanding progress . 
  and your country sure benefited of the euro , now when we want to buy weed , we do not have to change currency !, 
  bless your heart . 
  a lot of college students speak english , they still fail english classes because it requires them to understand something . 
  but seriously , i know we 're on reddit and stuff , but i lived in the south , i have some manners . 
  i am sorry for the loss of your friends , they greatly served the us , the death of friends is the hard toll that reminds us that freedom is not free . 
  whatever , do n't judge people on the country they were born , i did not choose it . 
  saying `` typical french '' and then making fun of ww2 was stupid , you obviously do not understand the human toll they paid in ww1 to make them not wanting to fight . 
  lafayette appreciate your grandfather . 
  i 'm surprised that as an american you can not understand written english though , `` even when they came to liberate you ( napol\u00e9on ) that was to create a puppet state '' does not mean `` we created your ass you did not exist lol '' . 
  i know how old is the polish nation , i also know that when it was under the rules of the prussian , they `` liberated '' it just to create a puppet state ( and that was the first liberation , after it was 1919 , and 1945 ) . 
  and i 'm going to teach you something : your grand father served your country , not you . 
  i did not lose any war , my ancestors did . 
  i know a lot of military guys in the us , and none of them bragged to me like you did , in fact they would be ashamed of you , and would ask you to stop using someone else 's accomplishment as yours . 
  and bless your heart . 
  a low euro would mean that you devaluate the money and created inflation , germany does n't want that , they hate inflation due to the hyperinflation in the twenties . 
  that 's actually them that fight the idea of a low euro . 
  and it can not really harmonize , because we all have different resources . 
  i 'm going to use an international trade theory called hecksher ohlin model . 
  the resources are also called factor of production . 
  it can be land , length of coast , situation compared to the international trade routes , education of the people , cost of labor or pretty much anything you use a lot to produce something ( that 's a theory so it 's simplified , reality is so complex in economy ) . 
  so that theory states that as the countries are differently supplied in factors of production , they will produce and export to another country a good whose factors of productions are relatively cheaper ( or more abundant ) than in the other country . 
  also , they will import the goods whose factors of productions are relatively more expensive ( less abundant ) in their country . 
  an example would help you understand : switzerland is abundant in capital thanks to their strong banking sector but they lack coast . 
  italy has a lot of coast , but relatively has less capital than switzerland . 
  so switzerland will export its capital to italy and will import fish from italy . 
  basically , it 's a development of ricardo 's theory of comparative advantage , you can read more here : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/heckscher\u2013ohlin_model careful , that 's a theory , so it has its limits , it does n't take everything in account . 
  now the goal of euro was not to give us the same economy , it was to suppress the cost of trading between different currencies . 
  if you produced in deutschmark and exported to france therefore getting paid in franc , the rate between the two currencies could drastically change between the moment of production and the moment where the money is exchanged . 
  even a 2 cents increase can be catastrophic on a multibillion contract . 
  so what you had to do was to use a derivative product , it 's like an insurance on the future price of a product ( a currency in that case , but it can be anything ) . 
  that eliminated the risk , but it had a cost . 
  now with the euro , we do n't have that problem when we trade among us . 
  example : you produced an heineken and it costed you 5 gulden , i say i will buy it for 5 francs ( let 's say at the moment we signed the contract 1 gulden = 1 franc ) . 
  but the moment it 's time for me to buy it i give you 5 francs and the exchange rate is now 0,5 gulden = 1 franc . 
  so you convert the money and you only have 2,5 gulden instead of 5 . 
  now with the euro , we do not have that problem !, 
  to be clearer , the maastricht criteria are not so important for country with a strong developed economy like germany , france , netherlands or even for italy . 
  what went bad , is that greece lied on their accounts to join the eurozone , they pretended to be way healthier than they were in reality ( they made a complicated financial package with goldman sachs ) , but when the crisis provoked by the subprimes ( a subprime is someone whose credit ratings are inferior to the standards and no loans should have been given to them ) touched europe , their fragility sent them in depression bringing with them other countries ( italy for example would have had much less issues without the greece ) . 
  the maastricht criteria are also called euro convergence criteria and were made so that all the economy would have as healthy . 
  those criteria are : * a government budget deficit ratio inferior to 3 % of the gdp * government debt to gdp ratio inferior to 60 % of the gdp ( france and germany were at that ratio when the agreement was signed then they increased it because they thought they were smart enough and there was no penalty so it led other country to do the same ) * inflation in the last 12 months inferior to a certain value * exchange rate stability ( the value of the older currency should not move much more than the others european currency ) * long term interest rate should be inferior to 2 % more than the average of the other countries . 
  basically greece respected only one or two of those criteria , and hid that behind the financial package . 
  crisis in ireland was more due to its economy tied to the financial sector ( so was cyprus ) and spain had a bubble on housing ( they were buildings a lot of stuff than in the end nobody bought , like the flowers in the netherlands a few centuries back ! ), 
  yes , i was with a basque friend and the waiter refused to let us pour ourselves the bottle of cider we bought and he served it the wrong way ( you have to raise the bottle really high so that it will oxygenate , and you only serve a small amount and he served it like a beer ) when we pointed that out , he told us he knew better , my friend answered in basque and then the waiter left with the bottle . 
  so 5 $ tip ( not even sorry ) . 
  i had hope in you son, 
  i mean the best dish i had was in a basque restaurant in nyc , but that 's not american food and it costed us $ 150 for two , food was worth it , service was horrible . 
  the worst one ? 
  i rushed a fraternity , so use your imagination , and yes , you can shudder . 
  american so pro-nato over everything , if anti eu then you wo n't accept to acknowledge any good thing from the eu . 
  vietnam and korea were proxy wars ? 
  have some fucking respect for the dead . 
  and eu began to built in 1954 , not in 1992 , they put their ressources of steel and `` charbon '' in common to rebuild the countries , no more war over the ruhr and alsace lorraine then . 
  because none of the countries respected the maastricht agreement, 
  you must be american or anti eu to say that . 
  overmilitarization has always created a conflict , us and ussr were in conflict in korea , vietnam , panama , cuba , colombia , chile , mozambique and others . 
  france and germany were two overmilitarized great power in 1914 , then there has been a war , like in 1870 , like in 1810 , like in 1939 . 
  since then , they are not at war and are great economic partners . 
  when you tie countries so much they are interdependent , they can not make war to each other because the risk is that by hurting their enemy they would hurt themselves . 
  i know we can not really say `` there would have been a war '' but we could calculate the aic ( that measures the heteroskedasticity between the explicative variables , you can find it by doing a logarithmic regression ) of those variables in order to know that . 
  you know it 's easy , you take war as the dependent variable ( dummy of course ) , as explicative variables you could use gdp , % of gdp in exportation to a neighboring nation and you find other possible explicative variables and you 'll find the result . 
  ( sorry bro , but as a finance grad student , i know my econometrics ) or you could just acknowledge that france was not a member of the nato during almost 50 years . 
  it 's not a democracy , it 's an aristocracy , i do n't care how it was in other places , we are not going to call cuba a democracy because north korea is worst . 
  it was the power of a privileged class that represented only 10 % of the population over 90 % of the rest , that 's called an aristocracy , that 's not called a democracy , i understand you love your country but deforming the truth is wrong . 
  it 's not because it has democratic principles that it is a democracy . 
  serfdom was already non existent in france at that time , so maybe peasants could not vote but they were free , so they had more rights than 90 % of the polish . 
  and that was not a democracy .

   and it does n't really work out that way , imo . 
  well we ca n't be a federation . 
  each country has its own history , language , culture . 
  i 'm all for a more unified fiscal system but that 's about it . 
  each country should have their own armies , police , intelligence organisations . 
  you can not share these things . 
  it would be pointless to try and i can not find any massive argument for it . 
   why would people care that they come from settlements , again we do n't do this for so many conflicts around the world a few french banks did get a few billions of dollars of fines for dealing with sudan or iran . 
  again you 'll say that those are different and i 'll agree with you , but it 's not like we 're singling out israel here . 
   it is completely ridiculous . 
   and who looks anyways where a product is made . 
  so then it should n't bother you . 
  what 's the big deal in saying okay these are made in this or that area . 
  more information is always better than less .

  security should be in layers . 
  we have this crazy belief : well if we put all the borders on the outside , nothing bad will happen on the inside . 
  well before a baddie from some random place in europe would have to breach all the countries in ee , ce to get to we . 
  now , you just need to find the weakest link in a huge border . 
  why do you think the calais problem appeared after schengen ? 
   or in short : in the united states , the states are actually united . 
  in the european union , there is more european than union . 
  uhm one 's a federation , the other is a couple of different countries with completely different histories that decided hey lets share a few things . 
  you 're a german , you should understand how federations work . 
   we 'd better just set everyone here recommending birth control pills that they 're all `` doing it wrong '' . 
  thats why for some women , bc is kinda super bad for them . 
  and why people are looking on less disruptive bc methods . 
   i 've known quite a few women who have had second and third month abortions but you can not generalise to all women , can you ? 
  your source says that the plane was ( and i quote ) :  fired at while in turkish national airspace it doesnt say anything about when it was shot down . 
   in fact , the russian warplane was shot down in syria 's airspace , '' technically that is correct . 
   and you want this in all of europe ? 
  if anything , eu should be issuing a warning to france about such practices . 
  france is in a state of emergency if news get slow to you . 
  also without such a state of emergency , 3-4 terrorists that were hiding in seine saint denis would have committed a new terror attack . 
  several days later the belgians had to begin a state of maximum alert in brussels ( http://www.lalibre.be/dernieres-depeches/afp/attentats-alerte-maximale-a-bruxelles-l-etat-d-urgence-prolonge-a-paris-5650c8c93570bccfaf37956a ) . 
  do criminals stop working beween 12 and 5 ? 
   however , he said that because under the country 's penal code , no raids can take place between 9pm and 5am ** unless a crime is in the process of being committed ** or in case of fire , the police had to wait until after 5am by which time abdeslam was nowhere to be seen . 
  id argue that being a fugitive is a crime ? 
   you are no less predictable yourself , nor are most other regulars for that matter . 
  yes but i am less trollish . 
  hurr durr durr france should get a warning from the eu for having stopped a terrorist attack . 
  we 'll agree to disagree . 
  have a nice day . 
   that said , i do n't think that france was in a state of war either they can conduct searches now in france without a warrant . 
  that 's very serious shit . 
   and one terrorist attack can not plunge all of europe into a war ( or even france for that matter ) . 
  or even a dozen terrorist attacks for that matter . 
  well arent you an expert . 
  frankly i dunno why i replied to your comment . 
  you usually have cartoonish levels of predictability in your thoughts . 
  no nuance , one can predict what you will say before you say it . 
  well france was in a semi state of war . 
  why was n't belgium . 
  there 's the problem . 
  no unified reaction to a common threat . 
  and no hormonal issues ? 
  dude you make abortion sounds nicer than the morning after pill . 
  i freaked out for a moment : two people thinking french sounds like russian ? 
  wtf ? 
  then i realised it was just you . 
  you missed the gist of the comment . 
  he 's shifting blame . 
  yeah we have problems but other are worse hurr durr durr . 
  while it 's both their fault , it 's her that can end up with any physical problems . 
  so yeah money should n't be the issue now . 
  i doubt abortion is an easy peasy japanese procedure . 
  why ? 
  isis is just the little saudi arabia that couldnt . 
  do n't drink that hot tea while you ` ry angry man . 
  major spillage risk . 
   i know what i want and she ca n't see inside my head . 
  do n't be greedy . 
  give her some head man . 
  so if belgium is in a state of war , they can not attack the invaders between 12-5, 
   but could have tipped him off . 
  well it 's good that they caught him then . ^ / s, 
  me too . 
  exactly the same reasons . 
  i think nothing of the sorts . 
  i simply believe that all european citizens should have the same visa rights and i also believe the eu should use its diplomatic muscle to achieve that . 
  hence why i never vote for anti-eu parties . 
   if turkey was admitted if ifs and buts were candy and nuts , we 'd all have a merry christmas, 
   that fact alone means all eu citizens are not equal . 
  the rest of the world can do as it desires and the eu can do as it desires . 
  if the eu decides to act as a block , then it can start asking visas for americans . 
  americans can retaliate and ask visas for europeans . 
  it 's a dick swinging game , all because the us is afraid of a few europeans . 
  such is the state of the world and the eu is in its rights to impose equal treatment for eu citizens . 
   if the eu wants to make all eu citizenship equal and change their passports to an eu passport it would be a different situation . 
  all eu citizens are equal . 
   passports within the eu are unequal . 
  how come ? 
  any eu citizen is free to go wherever they wish to travel inside the eu . 
  what is the difference , do tell . 
  it does not have a say in who is admitted to the eu and who is n't . 
  does europe have a say to whom the us gives passports ? 
  the us hands them to puerto ricans that can benefit from visa free travel to europe , even though in the states puerto ricans can not vote ( well their vote and voice does not matter ) . 
  in the same way we created a european passport and citizenship . 
  if you deny it from some countries we should be able to decide on state by state to whom to give visa free travel for europe .

  it 's not like china occupying tibet . 
  there 's already a european constitution , it 's the treaty of lisbon but they have n't implemented it yet . 
  europe has a legislative system with the parliament , a european court which sets the interpretations of the laws to all 28 members . 
  it even has a diplomatic corps with its high representative ( currently mogherini ) . 
  the only thing europe does not have yet is an executive power, 
  canada would like to have a word with you . 
  culture can still be managed by what would be the states/provinces/nations and not by the federal power . 
  as of now , quebec still has its own cultural traits for example . 
  how is american opinion any relevant to the actual efficiency of the un ? 
  it 's not because people think some guy came out of a virgin 's womb that it 's actually true . 
  the rule of spying is not to get caught . 
  trust me , you would n't . 
  because helping the process of nation building has worked so well in iraq and afghanistan . 
  if migrants are the sole consequence we face for that operation , i 'm pretty happy as far as outcomes go . 
  i ca n't imagine what an occupation force situation would have been like . 
  i think that 's the exact problem, 
  it may not be politically correct , but at one point our leaders will need to acknowledge that we do n't have the fucking space to welcome illegal uneducated migrants anymore . 
  just start barring the fucking gates , let 's be cold and heartless for once on this case and invest in the problems at home first before welcoming others . 
  i pity their fate , i really do . 
  but we 're just not in a situation where we can give them a helping hand right now . 
  now it can begin to plan its return to earth , at which moment its ai shall begin to exterminate the human race . 
  what 's funny is that some of the burnt cars belonged to muslims,

  it 's not even about losing . 
  london was destroyed by the war too . 
  italy actually has the third largest military budget after the uk and france . 
  imagine being born in a city of ruins . 
  a city that used to be a pearl in your nation , in your continent . 
  you are told you live in these conditions because of the war . 
  what war ? 
  the war , that of destruction , of bombings , of the nuclear bomb . 
  would you ever be in favor if being anywhere near a conflict after spending your childhood in these conditions ? 
  would you raise your children to think any other way ? 
  europe has suffered the bulk of two world wars . 
  cities that had stood for centuries were razed to ashes . 
  that is why today in europe you will never find anyone speaking openly and proudly about going to war . 
  it is either about helping allies ( the us for afghanistan and iraq ) and/or stopping terrorism . 
  even the libyan intervention quickly felt awkward . 
  going to war , occupying countries ... 
  these will always be seen as an evil , a failure to find a peaceful way of doing things . 
  that 's because next we 'll install a eu policy making the emperor a godlike figure . 
  cameron wants to tackle freedom of movement , i think it 's enough of a `` special place '' . 
  i 'm translating the feeling of french executives , not bashing the uk for what it wants to do . 
  and btw churchill wanted a commonwealth union , he advised for unity on continental europe and britain was n't to be a part of it . 
  texas is the largest , if you prefer, 
  first of all , a new president will not change french foreign policy . 
  it is an intricate system consisting in networks and connections , previous alliances and treatises and a few ideologies of french neo-imperialism . 
  unless marine le pen comes to power ( which she wo n't ) , nothing will change in french position towards the eu ( even if she does get to power , she probably will face constant opposition on every subject and will have no room to rule ) . 
  any other candidate will continue the french policy towards europe to support integration and the unionization of the eu ( we yet need to get a federalist , but it 'll happen with the next political generation ) . 
  there is an ideology in french political circles that the eu is great , that the european dream exists and anything impeding it ought to be countered . 
  that 's why the state will keep opposing the british in any change unless le pen is elected or cameron agrees to give a delicious deal to france . 
  getting in a position where they 're saying no at the very beginning gives them an advantage when the negotiations will begin . 
  they 'll be able to make more demands out of the british if they really want a treaty or rule change . 
  it 's all diplomacy . 
  it 's not about `` oh we 'll look at least '' . 
  france has invested a lot in the eu in the past decades , and our greatest leader in the 20th century has kinda given the state the advice not to let britain in , so people were already reluctant to the uk being part of it . 
  now the same uk wants a special place , do you see how it makes these guys bitter ? 
  on top of that many people in france 's establishment actually believe in the european dream , or have invested towards integration at least . 
  giving out special treatments can only impede it . 
  that 's a lot of bs . 
  even if they did try , do you think the federal government would accept its biggest state to secede ? 
  remember what happened last time ? 
  i 'd say probably less opposition to integration . 
  contrary to britain the other two big players consider further integration and political unity in their ultimate agendas and have done so for at least thirty years whereas the uk always joined because it wanted economic ties . 
  quebec actually has a lot of veto rights along with ontario contrary to the rest of the provinces . 
  the media and protesters are trying to turn this affair in a detroit/baltimore kind of issue , which is not the case . 
  i mean i know there is discrimination in france but c'mon guys we 're not on the same police brutality towards an ethnicity level . 
  you 'd be surprised . 
  as far as french youth is concerned i have n't seen any hate on brussels . 
  they do n't give a shit about sovereignty problems or such , and a federalization would be just shrugged over . 
  i do n't like jean-marie but seriously in a hall that big you 're gon na dive into the crowd and push people ? 
  wtf man, 
  impossible . 
  even if executives were willing to even think about it just imagine the backlash in congress . 
  the us armament lobby would be outraged that a foreign-built vessel be integrated in the us navy . 
  why not doing like canada instead of the us ? 
  the canadian constitution says that provinces and federal authority are on the same level and entails each of them has a specific set of objectives : ottawa controls tariffs and defense , provinces control culture , education and health . 
  on top of that canada has been able to maintain balance between many different cultures , english and french being dominant . 
  easy for france , it 's the revolution . 
  it 's easily what will be remembered of the country in a thousand years . 
  i approve, 
  the new nation of franco-germania , probably england 's greatest fear . 
  his predecessor had the balls to say `` fuck you '' to the americans in 2003 at the un security council whereas he was constantly trying to make friends with bush and obama like a groupie trying to get the popular kid 's attention . 
  protesting alcohol consumption of english people ? 
  do you want to get a genocide ? 
  notice how russia and the us are more than `` concerned '' with the potentiality of a first european military operation ? 
  they are afraid at the hints that glorious europa now arms herself , because it is a new step towards integration of military capabilities . 
  clinton would continue obama 's policies, 
  acting like the current russian federation does n't exist thanks to secessionist trends when the ussr collapsed , ya know, 
  haha !, 
  `` i 'm pissed you 're siding with the us saying you 're afraid over us annexing neighboring territory , so we 're going to attack you '' great way to make friends guys, 
  well technically it was a very well executed piece of foreign policy by the french and british . 
  sarkozy needed to take qaddafi out because he was threatening to release shady intel about his campaign finances , plus he was about to introduce a new currency in western africa to compete with the frank which is still controlled by france . 
  but on top of that , he did n't only secure international consent for the war by getting the un on his side , he also recruited god of war america to bear the costs of transportation and bombing instead of him . 
  so he accomplished all his objectives to neutralize qaddafi , boost his popularity at home for a time , make a statement on the international stage not to mess with him , and limited the costs of the military operation by splitting the bill with nato . 
  pretty well done in my opinion . 
  now libya is in shambles but let 's be honest the country 's stability was never the primary objective , otherwise they would have engaged in state building . 
  i agree ethically i do n't think he should reveal anything about his client , but he probably really did n't like having to defend him . 
  they should n't communicate the names of lawyers who defend terrorists and or spies anyways, 
  the lawyer is done defending him since he was now transferred to france .

  if corbyn fucks up so bad that blair successfully took back the labour party i 'm gon na laugh so hard .

  children was a great tune and it 's a shame that many great trance producers are mostly either one-hit wonders ( darude , energy 52 , robert miles ) , those with their own radio stations ( above and beyond , armin van buren , paul oakenfold ) or do n't even produce trance anymore ( tiesto , deadmau5 , underworld ) . 
  it 's the opposite with house , dnb and ukg producers like pendulum and disclosure . 
  it 's treason , then, 
  this is why macron won . 
  marine le pen should 've campaigned in wisconsin more . 
  [ this song perfectly sums up monsieur valls ( and marion marechal ) right now ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kyyvrbx4v0 ), 
  it 's fucking genius how the macron campaign used tonnes of fake data , fake emails and fake folders to fool hackers in the open . 
  if anyone wants to try to help , there 's an organization called the rainbow railroad that is raising funds to help lgbt people escape violence and persecution in places like chechnya . 
  these concentration camps are a main focus of the organization .

  the world is not meant to live like gilead .

  jeb is a mess, 
  the oppression of / r/le _ pen will never return they have lost . 
  ooh scary !!!!, 
  they should 've picked jean-yves le drian to run in 2011 instead of hollande . 
  i do n't know why no one wanted le drian . 
  he was one of the most popular ps politicians and would 've defeated hollande and aubry combined if he ran in 2011 . 
  well considering how the media did not freak out about the macron leaks unlike the hillary emails due to french law , hopefully it did not create any effect . 
  yeah it certainly seems that way when you compare them to the trump campaign in the last 2 days before the election . 
  like , the trump campaign did not feel a single sense of incoming defeat . 
  they knew that somehow trump will win especially after the comey letter . 
  kellyanne conway did not even sound defeatist during the last few days of the election unlike romney 's campaign manager matt rhoades . 
  marine le pen 's campaign manager meanwhile ( david rachline ) has sounded a bit sour during recent radio interviews after the debate . 
  if macron does win , then it can also prove that timeliness is essential to the alt-right if they wanted to do that macronleaks shit . 
  the whole timing for macronleaks was terrible and they could 've done this before the first debate even . 
  / r/europe is left-wing ? 
  oh yeah , the guy who looks like an older kad merad . 
  he should 've ran for president in 2011 for the ps imo . 
  holy shit you 're right . 
  steven seagal had always been an asshole in hollywood , mma , martial arts and even modern policing communities . 
  the reason why you do n't hear those is because he 's not doing big hollywood films like in the 90s . 
  a surprise to be sure , but a welcome one . 
  the problem though is that putin and the kremlin is too thick to understand that their economy is hurt because they have to continue this bullshit `` masculine '' charade . 
  pineapple is a serious crime though . 
  i 'd burn any italian city that dares to add pineapple to authentic italian pizza . 
  let us remember steven seagal 's `` punani snatching '' ama : https://www.reddit.com/r/iama/comments/4i0jso/i_am_actor_steven_seagal_live_from_thailand_ama/ never forget , steve !, 
  never forget !, 
  marine le pen : did you ever hear the tragedy of marechal petain `` the wise '' ? 
  i thought not . 
  it 's not a story en marche would tell you . 
  it 's a vichy legend . 
  marechal petain was a marechal of the vichy regime , so powerful and so wise he could use the nazis to influence the french to hate jews ... 
  he had such a knowledge of fascism that he could even allow jews in the free zone to be sent to the camps . 
  fascism is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural . 
  he became so powerful ... the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power , which eventually , of course , he did . 
  unfortunately , he taught his apprentice everything he knew , then his apprentice betrayed him to join la r\u00e9sistance . 
  it 's ironic , he could save others from death , but not himself . 
  marion mar\u00e9chal : is it possible to learn this power ? 
  marine le pen : not from en marche . 
  that explains it . 
  ah , so ja rule 's operating a greek tourism company now . 
  wow it 's like life imitating art !, 
  this sounds like a ponzi/mlm/pyramid scheme . 
  putin tells all the far-right/far-left/alt-right / nationalist leaders to support him with a loan from russian banks and the far-right/far-left/alt-right / nationalist has to recruit as many supporters as they could so that they could win elections and repay that money back . 
  the kremlin and orthodox church 's holy war against pokemon go is the funniest thing ever . 
  like , it 's so fucking pathetic . 
  looks like the greek orthodox teaches you about the basics of cqc, 
   douglas murray oh , another neocon trying to buck the alt-right meme . 
  okay . 
  looks like a mosque from a certain distance .

  well he did say some truly horrid things and what he did in regards to turkey was rubbish . 
  so one of his main arguments for leaving the eu was that he fears turkey joining the eu and yet a few months ago he said that the foreign office will still support turkey 's ascension to the eu . 
  the fuck ? 
  because by pushing for brexit , she could do away with eu regulations and continue plans for [ further privatisation of government services ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/mar/02/police-privatisation-security-firms-crime ) like [ the nhs ] ( https://tompride.wordpress.com/2017/04/23/theresa-mays-secret-plans-to-replace-nhs-england-with-private-us-healthcare-system-kaiser-permanente/ ) . 
  sure , but also you have brexiters and the british right-wing press being arrogant and ignorant too . 
  it 's a circlejerk of pompousness that would make the outside observer feel repulsive by it . 
  have you ever look at something like [ the rich kids of instagram ] ( https://richkidsofinstagram.com/ ) and feel disgusted by it ? 
  that 's how many in europe look at the british government , the british press and the british society post-brexit . 
  well , considering the right-wing press environment and the brexit voting bloc , she has to present a superior negotiating stance for her country which makes her and her cabinet look delusional to those outside britain . 
  she knows that all this posturing is for internal propaganda purposes and will never sway anyone outside britain . 
  hell , she picked david davies for brexit secretary and boris johnson as foreign secretary .

  387 # a month \u00f4o and here i was bitchin about the sncf 's prices  this equates to an average of 14 per cent of monthly earnings , well , if amazon wages ( 900 # ) are the new standard ... 
  they want a diplomat , not the joker spreading emptying gazoline everywhere, 
  i 'm hearing troubling reports on provincial hospitals . 
  athens and big cities are supplied ; but in random corners it 's not always the case apparently . 
  also they seem to face chronic shortages of medical employees because they ca n't afford to wage enough personnal . 
  i 'm wondering whether offering them free medical supplies & humanitarian help ( msf personnal deploying there in their hospitals ? ), 
  would allow them to rebalance their budget to more normal and european levels tho . 
  it 's probably doable for western countries without breaking the bank . 
  edit stuff like http://www.ekathimerini.com/213612/article/ekathimerini/news/state-hospitals-paralyzed-by-shortages-and-a-lack-of-maintenance ambulances not replaced or no money for the gasoline , etc http://greece.greekreporter.com/2016/10/18/greek-hospital-workers-union-complains-of-ambulance-shortage-problem/ and this is n't a new thing . 
  with 7 years of austerity by now , they never were able to actually replenish their supplies or fix shortages at any points : https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc3970095/ https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/feb/27/greece-blames-drug-companies-shortages https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jul/09/greek-debt-crisis-damage-healthcare-hospital-austerity edit my conclusion is that greece probably healthcare humanitarian relief at that point ( but do n't dare say so because it 'll be used as another excuse against them to add extra pressure and/or ask them for another bill they ca n't pay ) the migrant crisis also absorb some of the ressources going there , which admittedly does n't help ( but we ca n't really blame the greeks for that either ... ) . 
  sending them extra ressources if only for that would relieve pressure on the bulk of their own healthcare system ( by displacing a large part of the healthcare problem away from their own hospitals ) . 
  i 'm seeing isolated relief efforts ongoing ( http://www.msf.org/en/where-we-work/greece http://www.ifrc.org/en/news-and-media/news-stories/europe-central-asia/greece/humanitarian-crisis-in-greece--red-cross-scales-up-response-71991/ ) , but i would suggest that the eu/major western european nations start thinking of organizing some effort at their own level . 
  edit relevant : http://www.euractiv.com/section/health-consumers/news/doctors-launch-awareness-campaign-on-apocalyptic-greek-healthcare/ http://www.unica-network.eu/news/universite-libre-de-bruxelles-runs http://urgencesgrece.eu/en/la-campagne and it 's still a problem : http://dailyhellas.com/2016/11/29/public-hospitals-face-major-shortages-in-staff-equipment/, 
   but deep down they all know that they are as rotten as the right . 
  uh not really . 
  currently a large chunck of the mainstream right is the ump ( hilariously corrupt and seeing another money grabbing scandal explode every few weeks ) and fn ( which is very well known by now for its ... xenophobic ... politics ) . 
  at that point the right wing might want to do something to get himself candidates that are n't either mafia-friendly or nazi-friendly . 
  i guess macron is somewhat attempt being that but he 's the closest thing there to an honest-to-oil american republican who happens to also be french ( but then i 'm a dem ... ) . 
   they ca n't enter the border are closed if by `` italian/france border '' you mean they control train tickets ? 
   but the brit and the hungarian are still less human than us . 
  complete nonsense . 
   the burning of 650 cars would be on par with orr significantly worse than the very worst rioting / protests in the u.s. over the last two years . 
  not really because it 's spread country wide so it does n't really draw any direct street attention ; a bit like gun violence in the us . 
  thousands die from gun wounds each years , but you do n't always see it centered on big riots/gang shootings, 
  they stopped doing that because some considered it competition and set out to burn more ( srsly xd ) . 
  it 's sadly almost a running gag at that point . 
  there are also rumors that it encouraged some people to ... incidently receive insurance compensation on their shitty old car . 
   you mean nothing was leaked ? 
  there was actually , luxleaks indicates evasion help during his time as a pm for luxembourg . 
  but for more recently ; nothing really against the interests of the eu turned out regarding is time as an eu official . 
  of course there are divergences and disagreements regarding policies on some points , but nothing that could n't be seen as in the interest of the continent in some way . 
  i think he does have the eu 's interests in mind as of late in a general manner . 
  there can always be plenty of things i do n't know about , but as of now i do n't see any major conflict of ethics . 
  when he was pm of luxembourg , yeah , we know . 
  but thankfully there has been no such report since he started working as president of the eu itself . 
  they did n't `` just threw bacon sandwiches '' ; they also threw rocks and assaulted people , threathened passerby with death etc and basically acted like a biker gang doing a raid which resulted in police being called on them . 
  but thank you for being the posterboy for `` misleading by taking things out of context '' ^ ^ ^ / s furthermore , i doubt anyone said `` the solution is death '' , this is fantasy . 
  in europe , murders in prison generally happen either by other prisonners ( ie stuff like getting shanked for looking wrong at the wrong one or accused of stealing bread by another prisonner ) , or by guards on a powertrip going wayyy too far . 
  they 're not ordered by justice . 
   lots of fuckers in this country will praise this attack or blame the victims by accusing them of being kafirs for drinking and enjoying nightlife . 
  that 's depressing . 
  that mentality needs to change for the country to continue on the road of progress :( once again , condoleances to all the victims . 
  this horrible act against innocent partygoers that just wanted to live fully their life ( and especially killing other people in the name of religion ) is an abomination . 
  ( continuating my last post ) 0400 sputnik pretended that the shooter got killed . 
  but sputniknews is a very unreliable outfit . 
  i 'm trying to look up for whether there is further confirmation, 
  whatever, 
  stop trying to whitewash the responsability ultraconservative islam plays in those attacks . 
  whitewashing isis ideas is not going to do you nor anyone any favors . 
   we 've ( and parts of europe ) has seen this with the far-left ( and pkk is an offshoot in a way ) as well . 
  you are trying to willfully mislead the conversation to the pkk to draw attention to them instead of isis . 
  sod off with that regarding `` left wing terrorism '' historically it has nearly always been politically/economically motivated ; while islamic terrorism is absolutely caused by people taking their religion as an excuse to attack others and spreading that idea to others . 
  as long as you got retarded preachers paid to lie that `` allah wants you to kill x and x and oppress women '' ; or a government that gives priority to better jobs to conservative islamists ; you 're never going to solve stuff like daesh or shitholes like konia that generates them . 
  salafism/wahhabism is a branch of islam that went completely evil , and it will need to be fixed to start fixing the jihadi issue . 
  ( i do n't know how as of yet , but i can point out there is a major social problem somewhere in there )  and this probably wo n't be fixed by solving the ` religion ' problem . 
  patently false . 
  isis is based on that religion . 
  you litterally can not solve daesh without solving their religious crazyness too . 
  as long as the turkish gov thinks it 's ok for people to live like daeshis and quote the quran daylong to live like 1500y ago instead of sending people to a maths school and teach them modern engineering or something equally usefull to society , you 'll have that kind of islamic terror bullshit . 
  sadly you probably have good points . 
   getting involved in the syrian civil war whixh was none of our business to be honest looking how things went there ; i definitely do n't blame erdogan for trying to intervene in syria initially . 
  shit , i support coalition troops there ( but we fight isis instead ) . 
  what i would blame him for however is to have sided with the worst islamists in the lot for a long time . 
  to the point that only the salafists had the better weapons , so all the more moderate fsa got outgunned and sometime even destroyed ( or had to join the sdf ) ; which probably doomed to failure the fsa 's revolution . 
   helping islamist factions in the war some of which formed/joined isis later , ( ... ) legitimizing isis by calling them `` not terrorists but a bunch of angry kids '' yeah that bit likely did n't helped at all : /  islamizing the society starting with the education system that definitely damaged the country and will lead to more instability in turkey ... stating it will likely anger a lot of people ; but there are direct links there , statistically speaking big picture ( trends we see on most countries ) : - the less educated , the more religious and more people frequently end up terrorist - the more religious conservative , the less people pay attention to education , the more terrorism/violence and major stability problems increase in society - the more education , the less conservative religion is in the area over time , the more stable and prosperous countries tend to end up . 
  and so akp pushing religion everywhere and it 's ultraconservative form will likely damage heavily the country in the next ten year ( a lot less people getting higher education and leading the country to a better futur ; but more `` allahu ackbar '' to be expected ) . 
   how the fuck is akp not responsible for even a single one of them ? 
  i 'd say there are degrees of blame ; it 's not black and white . 
  like the past bombing one timed with the law to give him more power was very suspicious and had a number of mit fingerprints on it . 
  that one does not at all . 
  i mean you can blame akp for not stamping isis when they had the opportunity , but sometime things escape service grasps . 
  cf the attacks at the bataclan or orlando , which are very similar to this one . 
  but it is true that turkey has a problem with radical islam and desperate people pushed to become ever more conservative ending up crazy and doing terrible things like this . 
  i do n't think violence is a solution to it ; probably more education would help . 
  dislike for akp apart ; we saw no indication that it was akp or mit doing there that look like a real , non false flag , daesh terror attack . 
  if that is verified , that could be as a revenge for albab ; and their third attack on a night club . 
  at that point i 'm starting to think the jihadis ca n't support people being happy so they try to kill everyone that is using religious excuses for their jalousy/hypocrisy/frustration, 
  oh damn : / and in santa costume , wtf ? 
  ( reference time of my post is paris clock ) edit 0113 linked video apparently https://twitter.com/_infodujour/status/815349672365740032 edit 0114 already 2d apparently : / condoleances .

  shooter disguised as a cop ? 
  we do n't know yet at all ; but apparently odds are the shooter was n't a cop but isis by now ( 0251 ) . 
  regardless ; the whole incident is likely a terror attack . 
  0122 http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/gun-attack-on-popular-night-club-in-central-istanbul.aspx?pageid=238&amp;nid=107983&amp;newscatid=509 the press suggest 35 + killed 35 + k 40 + i hearthbreaking incident ; i hope they will find/catch the culprits 0126 some people seem to think they heard allahu acbkar ; but no way to be sure . 
  that would find 0133 the turks are now saying there was possibly a single attacker 0146 part of the reasons the death toll is high is because it was a nightclub completely full ( 700 + people reportedly ) and somebody went in and opened fire straight on everyone no claims that i know about yet , but the modus operandi fits with daesh once again at that point i 'm starting to think the jihadis ca n't support people being happy so they try to kill everyone that is using religious excuses for their jalousy/hypocrisy/frustration 0216 turkish media gag order reported regarding this attack ; from the pm 's office ; except on relaying official statements 0230 relevant footage showing armed gunman entering while shooting https://twitter.com/haberturktv/status/815363666828726272 0240 whitehouse also condamned in the strongest term the barbaric attack ( and so do i ) . 
  0309 mogherini ( defacto eu foreign minister ) condemns the attack too . 
  our thoughts goes to the victims . 
  0307 there are rumors the attacker ( s ? ), 
  spoke arabic 0325 rt.com ( the kremlin news outftit ) now suggest the attack was suspected earlier :  the owner of the reina 's nightclub , mehmet ko\u00e7arslan , has claimed that the club had been warned about a possible attack , and that the information came from us intelligence services . 
  security measures had been taken , he added . 
   `` us intelligence warned about such an attack about one week or 10 days ago -- and measures have been taken , including [ on ] the sea front . 
  and look what has happened , '' ko\u00e7arslan told turkish daily hurriyet . 
   and some tweets from politicians are hinting he was not murdered in prison . 
  care to link some ? 
  that said the prison & legal staff refuses to speak so unless it goes out to the press with more info it 'll be hard to say  he was sentenced under a blasphemy law well the top of the bbc article directly contradicts you ? 
   kevin crehan was sentenced at bristol crown court in july for racially-aggravated public disorder . 
  from what i can gather , the `` blasphemy '' thing is a rumor spread by angry ... right wing supporters ... who wanted him out and twisted things . 
  i mean there 's a group of big individuals that goes to a building ( a mosque in that case ) , start tossing stuff at it ( yes , including bacon and sandwiches ) ; yell at people working there and shove them and passerbies to start a fight ; yell random racist/xenophobic threats ; the cops get called in and arrest the gang ; that does n't shock me . 
  i would suspect the apologists want pretend it 's supposed `` anti christian persecution '' and a `` war on christianity '' in it and so invented a bit on top of it to make it plausible . 
  happy new year everyone !,

  corporate tax us : 30 % corporate tax france : 30 % govt expenditure us : 35 % govt expenditure france 50 % see , even with the same corporate tax , they have ** different ** economies so they have to apply ** different ** policies . 
   t 's like saying the intern who wrote a report for the ceo has the real power , because the ceo only approves or disproves it . 
  sounds ridiculous right ? 
  yeah when you make bullshit comparisons , you get bullshit results . 
  huuuuuge surprise right there . 
  i also love that you think the ceo is the parliament when actually the ceo is the president and the administration board is the parliament . 
  tell us more how knowledgeable you are in how organisations work ...  the government can not set a budget that does n't satisfy mps , they have to comply by what they want or not . 
  and the parliament can not set any govt . 
  that suuucks . 
  then the president can dismiss the national assembly and call for new elections . 
  so na can not fire the president but the president can fire the na which the more powerful of the 2 chambers ... 
  the president clearly is an intern ... 
  listen i 'll stop this pointless convo and i 'll stop talking to you . 
   and if the government does n't have the majority , it ca n't do anything . 
  it can very well use state decrees . 
   the government can try to set the tone , but if it 's not followed by the parliament it 's done . 
  can it say : oh teachers should teach this , and what can the parlament do , besides say no ? 
  again it can not set any tone ...  because parliament has far more power than the president , countries where it 's the opposite are called dictatorship , you might have heard of it . 
  have you heard of separation of powers though ? 
  means different bodies have different powers . 
   you 're electing the person who is going to represent you and vote the laws in your name at the parliament . 
  they basically just approve or disprove . 
  who sets the budgets ? 
  who sets the main goals ? 
  parliament just gives the go ahead . 
   who cares who initiated laws ? 
  again 90 % of the laws are n't initiated by the parliament . 
  the govt sets the tone on how the country will be run in the next 5 years . 
  it 's ridiculous to claim otherwise . 
   which is why legislative are the most important elections in terms of power . 
  there is n't a more important election . 
  it 's a separation of powers . 
   she 's just a pompous cow . 
  well now she 'll know she should be polite . 
   they gave us top gear . 
  sadly you gave them sabine ... 
  who needs an id/drivers permit every 4 years . 
  and i 'm sure people say : hey sign me up for that election in 3 years . 
  thanks . 
  did you bother reading the comment ? 
  you do n't need an id but you need to register beforehand . 
  which leads to ridiculously low turnout rates . 
  us does n't have a national id . 
  on the continent everybody has ids . 
  it 's just something you must get when you 're 12-14-16 . 
  you can not function without one . 
  applying for uni ? 
  opening a bank account ? 
  buying alcohol , cigs ? 
  going on a plane , id . 
  it 's a bit like a birth certificate and i do n't know anyone who does n't have an id . 
   america without even having an official government identification and ? 
  there 's a strong correlation between same day registration and voter turnout . 
  and us voter turnouts are * ridiculous * . 
  70 % for what ? 
  i 'm sure americans could offer more information but the fact that only [ 16/50 ] ( https://ballotpedia.org/same-day_voter_registration ) states offer same day registration and that voting happens on tuesdays which is maintained as a workday counts for a huge lot . 
   60 % which is a shame because that 's really where it matters , in terms of powers . 
  [ less than 10 % of laws voted by parliament are initiated by the parliament ] ( https://fr.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/loi#l.27initiative ) the most important laws passed have been propositions of the govt : * abortion made legal : simone veil health minister * gay marriage taubira justice minister * retirement reforms : various govts * abolition of death penalty : mitterrand * labour reforms : macron of course these are a selection but they 've either been massive or have create a huge uproar in society . 
   does that mean that french people trust their politics ? 
  we still consider politics to be hugely important for us . 
   it 's ridiculous to compare our presidential election with the brexit referendum , these are completely different votes . 
  yes when is vastly more important and it 'll span decades into the future of the country . 
  the other we do every 5 years , * twice * . 
   mps , the people who , you know , are voting and making the bills that affect us all , only 58 % showed up . 
  that 's normal . 
  it 's the second most important election . 
  popularity drops off . 
  election fatigue sets in . 
   why do you think french people are so blas\u00e9s with their politics ? 
  are we though ? 
  last presidential election we had 79 % turnout and we were already talking about how low it was . 
  uk had a referendum with 73 % turnout in a massively important decision and they were saying how high this was . 
  us presidential elections ? 
  they have n't had over 60 % since 1968 ( for a country that prides how democratic they are , they sure love restricting voting ) . 
  we are a very political country ( much more than any others i 'd say ) , we just had this summer several hundred people occupy a square in paris in order to talk politics . 
  during the retirement law projects , the protests would regularly get over 2 million and a couple of times over 3 million people in the streets of france . 
  we 're a loud bunch and we love our politics . 
  and like everything you love , when you 're a bit disappointed ... you 're actually feeling that you 're extremely disappointed . 
   almost everyone has lower wages in romania . 
  romania would have to pay literally more than 10x the average wage in order to match those countries a resident student gets paid as much as the cleaning woman http://m.stirileprotv.ro/lbin/mobile/index.php?article_id=3692721 they ** do n't have money ** to raise salaries . 
  but continue praising the gods for how low taxes are in romania . 
  the lost 10000 doctors but gained 1 brit so clearly they 're doing something right . 
   but in return you get one of the best educations the world has to offer . 
  we 're talking here about what results you get for similar costs . 
  listen you 're trolling here and in other convos . 
  you have a very limited knowledge of how romania actually works and the severe problems crippling that society . 
  or maybe you do live in a world cocooned in bucharest and also think 57 billion is a tiny amount of money . 
  totally manageable to lose it . 
  fucking half a trillion in 10 years is chump change . 
  but from the other side it seems like you just love to profit . 
  profit from high salaries while living in a country with very low tax that forces its very able and educated class to move abroad . 
  a country that invests very little in education and r&d . if you can live like that , perfect . 
  but if the vast majority of humanity would do what you are , society would crumble . 
  pipe down and enjoy the ride , it wo n't last for too long . 
   to me it looks like it 's 125 % of your military budget . 
  including pensions or not ? 
   that 's not really how budgets work , you would n't take everything away from the same place . 
  so we 'll just have 30 % fewer docs , 30 % fewer soldiers and 30 % fewer teachers . 
  awesome . 
  listen i 'll pretend i never read your comments because they 're ridiculous .

  if even varoufakis ca n't pull this off then you can be sure no one can . 
  somalia should do something about those german terrorists entering their borders . 
  sure , but if you 're immersed in a foreign language and take some classes you usually learn pretty fast . 
  it 's not very fun for the first 6 months or so but then things get a lot better if you put some effort in it . 
  there are tons of foreign phd students in my lab . 
  we start out with english but most of the time their french is good enough to communicate with ease within their first year . 
  what 's the alternative ? 
  sure people do n't have the same proficiency as in the us but the educated european youth in general knows enough english to work abroad . 
  but they are n't right now anyway , they 're all unemployed . 
   still no reason to vprotest violently . 
  if that 's the only way to solve systematic injustice and if the people support it , maybe it is . 
  and where are the reasonable people ? 
  it is , but it 's still pretty tough . 
  i have tons of friends who went to switzerland right after graduating . 
  that settles it then , the rosbifs are stuck with us . 
   believing in a special fairy godmother in itself is harmless . 
  sure but when you believe that the word of the special fairy godmother is above the law of the land then you have a problem . 
  imo , if there 's one industry we should keep on life support it 's definitely agriculture . 
  the amount of food on our plates should be independent of the current geopolitical situation . 
  so we should tax food transportation in order to encourage local production . 
  but then we get truck drivers blocking the highways . 
  there 's no way to win , really . 
   race means being part of a group of people who are identified by their race nice circular definition . 
  see ? 
  unified germany is always mean for no reason , thanks for proving my point . 
  east germany did n't have much of a choice ... 
  you need to understand that up until that point every time germany was united , something terrible followed shortly . 
  line tool = nazi, 
  yea i 'm pretty sure that 's a german fridge . 
  italy ? 
  i 'm so glad that my apartment building has a parking garage . 
  so when people say `` western europe '' you can only be sure they 're referring to france and belgium . 
  the other half knows about ragusa because they also played europa universalis . 
  because on top of all the museums , [ paris is also really pretty ] ( http://i.imgur.com/tisjnv3.jpg ) . 
  our taxis block the roads for us anyway , we wo n't see the difference . 
  it 's an austrian unique building !, 
  what was he thinking ? 
  can we unmod this guy already ? 
   it 's not current religion , or many places would say `` none '' i think it 's `` most common current religion '' . 
  in the state of s\u00e3o paulo ( brazil ) you can get tax deductions with receipts of stuff you bought , up to 20 % of the tax collected from the store for that purchase . 
  i think there 's a lottery involved as well . 
  those initiatives are a really smart way of fighting tax evasion . 
  here we have a rare specimen : a german with a good sense of humour . 
  have you seen varoufakis ? 
  he does n't need a helmet . 
  if his skull hits the pavement , the pavement cracks open . 
  once golden dawn restaures [ greece 's rightful borders ] ( http://i.imgur.com/stubmlt.png ) , most tourists in turkey will become tourists in greece . 
  that should solve the problem . 
  he 's just saying that balance of trade by itself is n't a good indicator of the wealth produced by a country . 
  he 's right . 
  because it 's so hot that you ca n't get anything done ? 
   well most that oppose `` mass '' immigration ( interesting choice of words there ) are xenophobes . 
  you 'd be surprised . 
  you think that 's the case because everyone who talks about it is labeled a xenophobe . 
  xenophobes are less likely to give a shit about being labeled so they 're more vocal on the issue . 
  also , why is the choice of word interesting ? 
  the thread is about `` bearing the brunt of the refugee crisis '' . 
   all syrian refugees together ( 4 million ) would barely be 0.1 % of europe 's total population . 
  til europe has 4 billion people . 
   your argument is odd btw . 
  do you think that students who struggle to find a job should also be `` limited '' ? 
  or older people in the jobmarket ? 
  these are n't really the same as immigrant integration though . 
  we never decided that we should increase the amount of unemployed youth and seniors , whereas opening your borders to unqualified workers is a conscious decision . 
  it creates a problem you did n't have . 
   there 's 10 % less because they 're lazy and do n't want to work and just want to profit of the wellfare system ? 
  do n't put words in my mouth . 
  if they are n't qualified and struggle to enter the job market we should limit the amount of people we bring in . 
  stop assuming that everyone who opposes mass immigration is a xenophobe . 
  the fact that you can explain it does n't mean it 's a good thing . 
  then you 're free to post different content .

  * [ xkcd pertinent : flux de travail ] ( https://xkcd.com/1172/ ) *, 
  i 'm glad that of all people it 's dclauzel who writes in both languages . 
  his english can be really hard to understand . 
  i 'm not defending him , and honestly his bilingual messages tend to make me cringe . 
  i 'm just pointing out that there 's no malice intended . 
   but no , muh french nationalism !, 
  it 's not about french nationalism , dclauzel 's english is just pretty bad for mod standards . 
  it 's really obvious when you understand french that he often uses false friends and bad literal translation . 
  it 's a bit embarrassing but those are just honest mistakes . 
  by limiting the amount of licences , the state created a shitty system that encourages the behavior you 're describing . 
  blame the game , not the players . 
  taxis are economically encouraged to speculate on their licences , and uber drivers are working outside the law . 
  legislation must be changed and enforced . 
  however if the players are beating their clients up you should blame them anyway . 
  you mean apart from [ all the economic and diplomatic sanctions ] ( http://europa.eu/newsroom/highlights/special-coverage/eu_sanctions/index_en.htm ) ? 
  i bet things would have been different if russia was attacking an eu country . 
  i told you , i do n't care if someone is paid to post on reddit as long as he brings sourced arguments , it literally does n't matter . 
  if there were dozens of shills brigading and down voting everything it would be an issue , but here i see nothing of the sort . 
  everyone is biased in one way or another . 
  if you disagree , attack the argument , not the speaker . 
   because governments are employing people to actively manipulate public opinion and i think that 's one of the most insidious and undemocratic things they can do . 
  silencing discussion by calling people names if they disagree with you is the most insidous and undemocratic thing you can do . 
   why is some random person so vehemently defending a trade deal they have nothing to do with ? 
  how do you know he has nothing to do with it ? 
  maybe he believes ttip would have a positive impact overall . 
  we do n't know everything about it yet so that question is still up to debate . 
  and the only way of figuring it out is by listening to everyone instead of calling people shills for no reason other than them disagreeing with you . 
  who cares if he 's a shill as long as he brings sourced arguments ?

  no shit . 
  do you see shiite muslims , ahmadiyyas , sufis and ismailis blowing up bombs in europe ? 
  i do n't think so . 
  sunni islam is being overtaken by wahhabism and salafism , and it 's a problem that no one inside and outside of islam is willing to tackle . 
  instead of tackling it , people like trump would kiss king salman 's hand instead . 
  damn , she thicc fam, 
  this . 
  most arabs in paris can be considered of the white persuasion by looks alone . 
  yes , in both the book and the new tv series .

  i 'd rather have armenia join the eu than turkey . 
  hell , that 's pretty much the entire francophone consensus . 
  i sense a plot to destroy the jedi ... 
  well , there 's more to the chinese than just china . 
  there 's issues like taiwan and growing chinese business communities in francophone countries that france will eventually tackle . 
  having sino speakers in macron 's cabinet sends a message that france takes china very seriously and that china ca n't take advantage of france easily [ like what happened in britain ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tl5dgzcwd_q ) . 
  that 's why china 's relationship with australia was at its most strategic during the rudd premership since kevin rudd spoke mandarin . 
  i love macron 's emphasis on multilingualism as a diplomatic advantage . 
  i do think that there should also be a mandarin speaker in macron 's cabinet ( particularly in the economic and trade ministries ) though . 
  it 's what happens when muslims from countries and sects who were taught that they are superior than everyone else ended up interacting with other muslims online . 
  fucking good !, 
  there 's no sandstorms in europe . 
  hell , full-faced veils are not even mentioned in the quran . 
  a scarf on your head is fine enough . 
  you wo n't go to hell for not wearing a full-faced veil . 
  just wear a veil . 
  that 's it . 
  none of that full-faced shit . 
  wahhabi revisionists trying to make the full-faced veil compulsory in islam really makes me sick . 
  hell , the full-faced veil is basically reinforcing the lack of trust muslims and non-muslims have towards each other ( which is exactly what the wahhabists and salafists want ) . 
  even so , he still has the right to travel . 
  do you support the revocation of the rights of falun gong , uighurs and dalai lama followers in china ?

  what 's more ironic is that these same mafia groups support parties like lega nord . 
  the arena clan will sign your treaty . 
  `` it 's fine '' - average brexiter, 
  if being skeptical of a country 's direction makes me an elite then i 'll take that badge with fucking pride .

  i consider oss117 to be the superior french version of austin powers . 
  i do n't think mike myers can conceive a scene as genius as the beach orgy in rio ne r\u00e9pond plus, 
  this series was france 's equivalent to archer and it 's great that netflix picked it up for worldwide distribution . 
  in fact , it 's a much better netflix show than the godawful `` marseilles '' .

  yeah but muh homogenous white racist continent overrun by muslim rape gangs stealing all dem white wimminz and cucking all white men !!!!, 
  ( this is what / r/european , / r/the _ donald , / r/pussypass and / r/theredpill seriously believes ), 
  more like telepassur, 
  i 'm pretty sure there will be a delay . 
  that 's typical of government . 
  dude , malaysia shares the same system with the uk . 
  i 'm familiar with commonwealth parliamentary system . 
  but you know what i 'm more familiar with ? 
  bureaucracy . 
  nothing ever gets fast from any government . 
  and thus , the same will apply with brexit . 
  yeah and if 5 years ago if i tell people that francois hollande would n't survive his presidency they 'll be laughing at my face . 
  we live in the age of uncertainty . 
  do n't be sure of yourself . 
  i fucking doubt that the brexit negotiations will be complete before 2020 . 
  by that time britain might have a new government that might be pro-eu and then they will cancel the negotiations or try and start the returning process back . 
  hell , britain has to negotiate with 27 nations , and if one of nations can halt brexit to eternity . 
  it 's why some countries still have their eu ascensions halted for years . 
  what 's more shocking are the amounts of people ( especially in this subreddit ) who believe that leaving the eu will be a swift process . 
  what the fuck ? 
  have these people ever worked in public service or faced public service in their entire lives ? 
  i 've worked with governments ( and literally , i meant various governments ) and bureaucracy is so slow , you can download the entire internet and it 's still faster than signing an agreement between two nations . 
  now , take that and multiply by 27 . 
  that is the complexity of brexit . 
  edit : the responses below just fucking proved my point . 
  the lack of skepticism towards the british government is astounding . 
  the fact that british citizens completely trusts theresa may 's cabinet in handling this just blew my fucking mind . 
  if anything though , netflix has done a great job promoting french tv and french cinema to a wider audience and i think that should be recognised . 
  ever since i 've come back to my home country , i 've seen more french films legally than i did before netflix came . 
  back then i had to either torrent or wait for the local french festival organised by alliance francaise in order to watch a french film . 
  now i can watch a decent library of french films thanks to netflix . 
  fremaux and fncf are actually a threat to the promotion of france as a cultural soft power . 
  if fremaux and fncf got their way , then they would be able to block any future french film from being available on netflix/amazon/filmstruck which would limit exposure of french cinema to the entire world .

  i am not knowledgeable enough in pre-1917 and post-1917 russia to provide counterpoints but i would advice against putting too much weight into comparisons in history . 
  to think that the french revolution was `` fueled by philosophy '' is historical revisionism at worse , and a very annoying oversimplification at best . 
  very few enlightenement philosophers were for a republican model , for exemple . 
  contested government , the counter-powers ( in particular the parliaments - not the same kind of parliament as today ) sinking louis xvi 's tentatives of reforms and economical troubles led to the revolution . 
  i 'd say that the power game between the bourgeoisie and the aristocracy/clergy ( the bourgeoisie won ) is an equally or more relevant `` fuel '' than the `` enlightenment philosophy '' . 
  also should avoid parisian-centrism . 
  it should be noted ( because i see allusions to this quote nearly everytime the hre is named ) that it apply to the hre in voltaire 's time , and not on the hre at every point in history . 
  because in voltaire 's era the hre had n't much ground anymore to be called holy ( the emperor had ceased to be crowned/blessed by the pope , because it would be a bad political move against protestant members ) nor roman ( rome and north italy had drifted from the empire ) and had become so decentralised and its members with so much autonomy that yes , it was a poor excuse of an empire . 
  if i take the exemple of african eufor they are often just a few peacekeepers that france has to slowly convince to come along after taking most of the impact/quick intervention . 
   the reason we have to spend 3.3 % is because our european allies , canada , and japan have huge military gaps and we have to fill them . 
  no , to be honest you spent such an amount because you have extremely big geopolitical goals and commitments and want an extensive projection ability . 
  also a bit of militaro-industriel lobbying . 
  a military stronger europe would relieve the american on some operations , but i do n't think it would have a substantial impact on your spending . 
  i agree that military spending have been let down ( it 's going to go up now , hopefully , but i do n't know to which extent ) , but it would be dishonest to say that america does n't benefited/benefits greatly from nato , in other fields than the purely military . 
  nato is n't a common army , just an alliance . 
  there is no real opposition to an european alliance , because there is already one ( with nato ( which is n't just the american , everybody have a multilateral commitment ) and one of the european clause cover it i think ) . 
  a common military is another beast , and imply homogeneity of the army and command structure . 
  the first big problem is that the army is basically the ultimate opt-out , the tool of sovereignty . 
  if there is a very strong disagreement between a member-state and the commission ( or another hypothetical eu body ) , the member-state ca n't be physically compelled to do something , because it has an army , and not the eu ( for exemple the commission does n't want britain to leave ? 
  well nothing they can do to stop that ) the big problem with a common army is that we do n't have a common foreign policy , our foreign interests are n't homogenously perceived and shared . 
  if something happen in mali for exemple france is much more encline to intervene because it has companies and expats there , interests in neighboring countries , that even just morally speaking it 's an ugly thing happening there in tumbuctu and that france is less reluctant to send soldiers to fight abroad to fight and die for its ideals and interests . 
  other countries wo n't want to send the common army because they do n't have much interests there and are more reluctant/opposed to interventions . 
  basically the `` we 'll use the army only against invasion '' side will keep the army effectively useless except in case of invasion ( the virtually unavoidable scenario if we keep a unanimity mode of decision ) . 
  or the `` time to intervene '' side will send men of nations opposed to an intervention . 
  we need a stronger sense of belonging to the european identity , sharing more homogenous goals and foreign interests and a common foreign policy ( which work closely with the army in many times ) before we can really build an european army that will not be paralysed . 
   countries the size of eu member states ca n't be a global or even regional force on their own . 
  a country like france can still use its army to apply significant projection occasionally , and against a big country it has nukes and the possibility to increase the war effort if it has time . 
  i 'm not saying it cover everything , it clearly does n't , but it is still a very useful tool . 
  i blame ethnocentred universalism . 
  `` what do you mean everyone does n't naturally tend toward our societal/cultural/moral values ? 
  surely if we kill a few madmen/tyrants the people will rise to freedom and be free from obscurantism !, 
  what , ` they are not nations-states with strongly established national identity and they have deep tribal , regional and religious divisions ' ? 
  what non-sense are you spouting about ? '', 
  ( or the idea that `` a good revolution solve everything , and if it does n't work it mean that you just need to do one again '' , a french classic ), 
   he 's the least favourite candidate in the r\u00e9publicains primaries . 
  where did you get that idea ? 
  would n't it still be correct , although with a nuance ? 
  the `` to '' just add a purpose , a will behind the act , but it 's still linguistically correct , no ? 
  it gives no garantee that the next government wo n't be as shitty . 
  just that the need to keep a multi-parties coalition will make it more eratic , more unstable and less susceptible to actually do stuff . 
  like the fourth republic , or israel 's current system . 
  and goverments that fall quickly do n't make their members politically deads , you know . 
   i do n't know how france ( after the next elections ) the probability of marine le pen winning the presidential elections is extremely low , though .

  paging / u/rhaktor to let him know i found a sub and in case he want to do some plotting/discussion with him before session . 
  ten escaped from the local zoo forty years ago ( and others during the tempest of 1999 ) and they have since reproduced . 
  it should be noted that this mp game has been kept ( in no small amount thanks to / u/rhaktor diplomatic game and fair-play . 
  and also because of some asian shenanigans ) extremely balanced : you normally do n't see a purely african africa , almost no european presence in asia ( yet , brace yourself , it is probably coming ) , america is just an hilariously rare sight ( the two big owners of land : cheerokee and exiled cologne ) , and in general matter you normally have far more ugly borders . 
  at least from my experience . 
  if other players here want to give their mind ? 
  there should be opportunities to play good nation , though . 
  for exemple starting this week i 'll not be there anymore to play the ethiopian empire anymore . 
  i will ** not be able to play the glorious empire of ethiopia ** . 
  i strongly encourage people wanting to play to take the head of the coptic empire : i 'll not be there for the later week as well so if you want you 'll be able to keep it to the end and enjoy the fruits of your efforts . 
  ethiopia is in a relatively good position : she is bff with kilwa and have an informal alliance with tunis and the ottomans . 
  i deeply encourage the potential new player to keep these alliances and make them prosperous , to do otherwise would be not only be backstabbing but also very foolish . 
  also apparently the ai allied pegu last session . 
  basically african frontiers are drawn , ethiopia 's conquests are taking place in the wealthy indian subcontinent , where many rich provinces have been taken and cored . 
  an agreement has been reached with the ottomans and bukhara ( i can send it in pm or you can ask them ) , and i advise respecting it . 
  but bengal is ripe for the taking . 
  there is a conflicting claim with pegu who claim the richest bengalese provinces , you can negociate with him or go to war . 
  even if i 'd say military odd are good enough , finding a diplomatical compromise and keeping pegu as an ally have the huge benefit of presenting a united front against european greed . 
  the tech is n't very good , and the unbalance ( admin tech is low , you should focus on it ) gave like 10-15 corruption , but you can close the gap and the other africans are n't bad . 
  ( and at least you 're not bukhara :p ) if you maintain good relations with the africans and the ottomans , and negociate a bit with pegu , it should be a relatively easy session with enough opportunities . 
  so ** come and have a try ** . 
  all hail the house of solomon !, 
  well , technically vatican city 's got 100 % , so ... 
  louis xvi killed by janissaries ? 
  you : `` france 's services should stop this from happening '' / u/quas4r : `` you ca n't stop every attack of this kind , if there is enough tries . 
  eventually , one is bound to do it , in particular if he works ( nearly ) alone or plan quickly '' i fail to see where is the understanding problem . 
  strictly speaking `` liar '' is apparently broader as it means `` a person that has lied * or * that lies repeatedly '' . 
  but regardless the psychological and thus diplomatical effect of these words are not exactly the same . 
  perhaps some people here do n't like gratuitous insults and salty hyperboles ? 
  there is also the viewpoint of considering the head of state as a representation/unifying point of your country , like a flag , and then the comparison is a bit like burning your nation 's flag . 
  of curse you might still disagree against such laws , but it is n't purely a monarchist thing . 
  `` it does n't make any sense '' mean than there is n't any coherent theory/viewpoint justifying the existence or use of a non-elected head of state , which is completely false . 
  you can disagree with them , but do n't do as if every person opposing you on this subject is a backward moron . 
  it completely depends on what are your criteria for what you consider a `` serious power '' , though . 
  i 'd say there is a difference between a foreign minister saying than another foreign minister `` told a lot of lies during the campaign '' and `` is a liar '' . 
  the former imply a ponctual , past action , and the latter imply a present , almost chronical/pathological * modus operandi * , and is also attacking someone personally instead of his actions . 
  you may think that the difference is n't that big , but i 'd say that diplomatically it makes some difference ( in particular considering it 's a top diplomat speaking publicly of a counterpart ) and that in particular ** when you are putting quote marks you should quote the verbatim faithfully ** , which the guardian disapointingly did n't do here . 
  [ si tuvieras f\u00e9 como un granito de mostaza ... ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0etia52n9m ), 
  i do n't know where you came with this explanation . 
  not only it does n't make much sense ( they 'll get as much , and probably more tourism with a pretty completed basilic that one in construction ) , that was pretty much the point from the start to have a drawn out construction : it is an `` expiatory temple '' , and the goal is to have people participate in its construction , for spiritual reasons not unlike the builder of this ` cathedral ' .

  bah , be happy , in a few years we 'll be much lower . 
  yep , it 's pretty small and far away , i doubt we have any opinion on them . 
   our few good stereotypes what ? 
  i thought it was our stereotype !, 
  it 's like the only positive one we 've got !, 
  last time i saw a poll about the eu was n't less popular in france than in other countries , so i do n't really get why only french people would avoid this subreddit . 
  what ? 
  the eu is still pretty popular in france ... 
  wait ... are you saying that countries where riots happen are uncivilized ? 
  what is sad though , is that half the time i see a frenchman talking on reddit , it 's you , lablanquetteestbonne . 
  which probably means that there are n't a lot of us on reddit , due to most french people sucking terribly at english . 
   like 90 % of serbian people will never recognize kosovo as independent state and never will i find this surprising . 
  so most people in serbia would want to force kosovars to be part of serbia ? 
  why ? 
  why do they care ? 
  i think germanic languages are really hard for romance language speakers and vice versa . 
  you rarely encounter native german or english speakers who can speak decent french . 
  so , hmm ... can you elaborate ? 
  i 'm not familiar with serbian politics ... are people upset that kosovo is independent now in serbia ? 
  ah well , some stereotypes are true . 
  the fact that we suck at english in general is definitely true . 
  that stereotype about how the french supposedly refuse to speak english because they 're proud is total bullshit in my opinion though , the main reason why french people wo n't speak english is usually either that they ca n't at all , or that they suck so much at it that they 're ashamed . 
  but do n't get me started about the bullshit stereotypes , like , i do n't agree that the french are dirty and rude chain-smokers ... and french women definitely shave their armpits thank you very much :p, 
   the swedish people in the thread are rather skeptical as to the severeity of this spread in reality , compared to the way the article describes it . 
  yes , that reminds me of the riots in france in 2005 ... 
  some mild riots by poor people in the suburbs following an incident with the police somehow turned into `` omfg muslims in french suburbs are starting a civil war '' in the anglo-saxon media somehow . 
  when it happened i did n't notice anything nor did anyone i knew in france , i learned about it from foreigners i knew who kept asking if there was a civil war in france ( by muslims apparently ? 
  not sure where they got that one from ) . 
  sometimes the media is weird . 
  you have no idea how excited i am right now . 
  yeah my reddit-to-work ratio is very high these days . 
  i wish the bbc understood that about the french . 
  well to be fair , vigipirate has been going on for years ... 
  so in practice we have soldiers walking around with automatic weapons at peacetime in france , yes . 
  then again , they 're pretty harmless , i doubt any of them ever fired their weapons ... 
  since i guess they 're only allowed to in case of a terrorist attack ( happening under their eyes , which seems very unlikely ) . 
  there 's a few of them in airports and train stations in paris , it 's part of the anti-terrorism plan ( vigipirate ) . 
  i do n't get how that helps against terrorism though ... fortunately i 've never seen them outside paris . 
  i do n't know . 
  there 's no declensions and only two genders at least . 
  well . 
  french music is more popular outside of france than i thought then . 
  still much simpler than german . 
  dude , german is * way * too complicated to ever become a lingua franca . 
  the grammar of english is just so much simpler ... plust most germans can speak english pretty well anyways ... 
  to be fair , even in good restaurants you ca n't know if they 're not putting cheaper olive oil in good olive oil bottles . 
  i knew someone who worked in a pretty expensive restaurant in france who used to tell me that they made people pay for evian bottles that they served open , and they were actually refilled with tap water ... 
  i 'm not sure what the outcry was about , it 's good to ban these sort of things , it protects the consumer . 
  honestly coming from southern france ( around the mediterranean too ) , i do n't feel that things are all that different when i go to greece ... 
  it certainly feels like europe to me . 
   maybe we should have a series of posts where people can write about the respective , preferably smaller , less known , countries of europe . 
  do we even have armenians on this subreddit ? 
  i do n't think i 've ever seen one . 
  i had no idea soad was armenian-american ... 
  mind blown . 
  i knew charles aznavour is of armenian origin though , but i 'm surprised you even know about aznavour in poland . 
  well , ca n't we feel that we 're both from country x and european ? 
  seriously ? 
  :d http://eurovision-quotidien.com/audiences-france-3-leurovision-en-berne/ the voice on tf1 got 6.95 million viewers that night , a theater play on france 2 got 2.88 million viewers that night , hawaii 5-0 on m6 got 2.86 viewers that night , and finally the eurovision got 2.7 viewers , i.e. 
  4th place out of the four `` big '' french channels ... 
  if you 're an artist and want recognition you can just go to any french show and get more viewers than that , hell , if you just went to the voice ( which is a singing show too ) on that very night you had more than twice as many viewers ... every night you have shows with way more viewers than the eurovision in france . 
  it 's anything but an opportunity ... 
  are you seriously implying that the french contestants of the eurovision are great/famous french pop artists ? 
  and no , they do n't care about the audience because most french pop artists sell their albums in france and nobody watches the eurovision in france anyways . 
  ... or ... it sucks because nobody cares , so we do n't have several rounds with several competitors where we pick the best one to send him to the eurovision like they do in sweden . 
  instead , it 's aired on a low-audience state channel one night , with a shitty contestant that has been picked god knows how , and that 's it . 
   especially the french . 
  aaah , prejudices and xenophobia . 
  grow up . 
   it 's popular all over . 
  i completely disagree , it clearly is n't in france . 
   i do n't know a god damn soul who watches eurovision . 
  same . 
  but given how people are always talking about eurovision on / r/europe , it seems to be popular in some parts of europe ... 
  i completely agree . 
  if european kids grew up with random european people as their idols , we 'd have a generation that feels european at least . 
   and judging by france 's entries , you people just do n't get it . 
  it 's either too serious , or too `` pff this is stupid '' . 
  it 's not like we pick our entries . 
  it 's always random singers nobody has heard of , i have no clue who picks them . 
  same . . 
  there is a point to eurovision ? 
  / r/europe is basically the only place where i hear about eurovision . 
  it really is a much bigger deal in other countries than it is here ... 
  wait , are you saying that * we * understand the point of eurovision ? 
  which makes me think ... can you imagine how rich and powerful europe would be today if the ussr had n't completely fucked up the economy of half of its countries ? 
  a real shame ... 
  yes but it does n't work for greece ... 
  it works better if you simply observe that the highest the influence of the ussr was , the poorer the country . 
  greece is the exception because it has to do with the communist divide , not religion . 
  not trying to ruin your efforts , but [ the purchasing power density map exists ] ( http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8064/8244605058_f5b3c55493_o.jpg ) . 
  damn , and i thought paris was expensive . 
  ah , someone understood . 
  nope . 
  they insisted that we had to be consistent though , i.e. 
  not mix us and uk spellings . 
  it 's not like it 's school that really teaches you english . 
  the internet does :p edit : in any case , in school , they always mentioned both spellings and said that we could use either . 
  same with words like flat/apartment , bill/check , autumn/fall , etc. 
  not really , france has a low population density pretty much everywhere other than the coastline and paris ... and around lyon maybe .

  the good people of this subreddit . 
  who did you think ? 
  why are people still linking to this site ? 
  i thought we 'd discredited it as left-wing propaganda . 
  i agree with you that peak oil took the world by surprise . 
  i just do n't see why you 'd want to tether monetary policy at a time of great volatility and uncertainty in energy ( life-blood ) markets . 
  seems ridiculous to me . 
  wow , they really are desperate now . 
  spain and italy are already in the shit as they 're essentially insolvent , not to mention illiquid . 
  they * will * require more financial `` aid '' , whether greece exits or not . 
  what amazes me is that people still think that the euro is essential to europe to the point where they 're willing to accept a depression in the peripheral states because of it . 
  if greece had left two years ago instead of accepting the first `` bailout '' , they 'd be back to growth by now , if the history of defaults is anything to go by . 
  but then , maybe this time is different ... edit : and you 're right that the various `` stabilisation '' funds do not have enough money for spain and italy . 
  my guess is that the ecb will be forced to start printing unsterilised money to buy their sovereign bonds . 
  the possibility of contagion was also there with argentina - it 's not as if theirs was an isolated country . 
  they have significant free trade agreements and dealings with the whole of the americas . 
  and what do you mean by `` wider scope '' ? 
  the return of the drachma and a large-scale sovereign default would be good for greece fairly quickly , if history is anything to go by . 
  [ argentina ] ( http://www.cepr.net/images/stories/blogs/argentine_gdp_21495_image001.gif ) is just one example of a major economy doing this . 
  they defaulted in 2001 . 
   they will get payed back interesting ... 
  no , it was n't until after wwii that the economy recovered . 
   a less conservative monetary policy . 
  more like the fed , instead of how the ecb is acting now . 
  so the 1 trillion euros that they 've lent out in the last six months is n't enough ? 
  the [ balance sheet of the ecb is larger than that of the fed ] ( http://www.zerohedge.com/news/ecbs-balance-sheet-now-far-bigger-feds-more-levered-lehman-piigs-exposure-50-6-months ) ( and that was before ltro2 !, 
  ) , by the way . 
   but as much as it may have been a mistake to create the euro , it may still be a much graver mistake to let it disintegrate . 
  why do you think that going back to national currencies would be a mistake ? 
  so we should revert to the ` extend and pretend ' policies that got us into this crisis instead ? 
  we should have kept on with the same policies that screwed us ? 
  it 's a very dangerous game to pile on debt in order to get yourself out of debt . 
  you may not like austerity , but unless there 's a comprehensive plan to utilise the new debt to obtain real growth ( there is n't ) , then more than likely it 's just going to add to your burdens . 
  good luck , europe , you 're going to need it . 
  who would syriza join with in coalition ? 
  and how much of the vote would they need ? 
  not yet . 
  no doubt they 'll try , but as long as there are national elections , the people can still make their choice , as we saw in greece and france . 
  they ca n't save it at all . 
  the only way out of this ( from their perspective ) is the creation and monetisation of eurobonds . 
  but i suspect the people of europe wo n't let them . 
  thank god for democracy - it 's not dead yet . 
  why , because he 's always wrong ? 
  what 's that got to do with anything ? 
  wording 's all there is - i ca n't hear the tone of your voice from here . 
  i thought this was a joke when i first saw it . 
  and yet i ca n't find a single mention of the word ` propaganda ' on this thread . 
   ca n't have those scumbags deciding about our privacy on the internet . . 
  it 's not about them being ` scumbags ' , but about them being unelected by us and unaccountable to us . 
  that 's why we do n't like over 60 % of our new laws being created by the eu . 
  and this financial crisis will only exacerbate this . 
  why mention the word * hate * ? 
  we love europe , we just do n't want to be politically tied to it . 
  why is that so hard to understand ? 
  edit : in fact , looking back at your comment history , it looks rather like * you * hate the british , rather than the other way round . 
  no , it 's what i read when i see ` focus on growth ' . 
  although i agree with the sentiment , this is not what is happening here . 
  if a government can not be formed then they need to have another election . 
   focus on growth ; policies and pace should be country specific . 
  i 'm not an economist but by early 2009 i had figured this out . 
  you 've `` worked out '' that more debt is the answer ? 
  he was looking in one direction only when he said it . 
  maybe he was just speaking to one person . 
  once again an economic catastrophe brings in extremist parties . 
  maybe one day we 'll learn our lessons and start to manage money soundly . 
  i doubt it though . 
  yes , but the euro is essential because ... er ... sorry , why do we need it again ? 
  the immigration policies of the eu are hardly practical either - they 've partly got us into this mess !, 
  hate the far-right all you want , but it 's the policies of the eu that have led to its rise . 
  good lord , no . 
  on this subreddit , maybe . 
  the eu will spend itself to death . 
  is that a joke ? 
  mid-wales has a serious teenage pregnancy problem . 
  awesome . 
  just wanted to confirm that you are indeed a student as is evident from your naivety and idealism . 
  what do you study ? 
  why is that funny ? 
  spain has defaulted more than any other country on that list since 1800 . 
  but that 's not really the point . 
  the point is that you think it ca n't happen again , yet you present no evidence . 
  [ spain has defaulted 9 times since 1800 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sovereign_default ), 
  spain has defaulted more than any other european nation . 
  there have been numerous defaults inside currency unions . 
  it * will * happen again . 
  why on earth would you think that it wo n't ? 
  how are they exempt ? 
  why is this time different ? 
  it 's clear that you know close to nothing about economics . 
  why do you think it will not happen again ? 
  it makes a lot more sense when you realise that international aid is actually international bribery - a way to get foreign governments to enact favourable policies . 
  without ltros , these banks would have faced margin calls on most of their debt due to a fall in the asset prices . 
  seriously , you should look into this because your understanding is severely limited and completely on the wrong track . 
  they are forced to ( and encouraged to ) because otherwise they 'd go bust . 
  europe was not ready for the euro . 
  all i can think of is how it blows for the first time at the university of chicago ... 
  i 'm amazed that you 're suddenly all for austerity measures !, 
  spain is being fucked by the eu/eurozone/germany , not by the ratings agencies/wall st. 
  it amazes me that they 've lasted this long . 
  anyone with half a brain can work out that a country with 22 % unemployment , 8.5 % budget deficit , and 61 % debt-to-gdp , where there banks are forced to take billions from the ecb every 3 months , is not worth an a credit rating .

  have you ever gone through the process of publishing an academic paper ? 
  what you 're describing is n't really possible . 
  maybe if the reviewers suggest major revisions , the editor agrees , and you 're 100 % sure that the editor is going to choose the same reviewers when you resubmit . 
  and i 'm relatively sure that most reviewers would be appalled to receive an author 's email in this situation and would promptly inform the editor . 
  you put the preprint on the preprint repository , and once it 's peer-reviewed you indicate that fact in the preprint repository . 
  the preprint is available faster , freely , and is still peer-reviewed . 
  if you see a preprint that has n't been published yet you take it with a grain a salt like any non-peer-reviewed publication . 
  i fail to see any drawbacks . 
  i know , i 'm in math and it 's the same . 
  peer reviewers can refuse without any backlash if they want , hence `` volunteer '' . 
  and peer reviewers being paid is extremely rare , as far as i know . 
  what 's your point ? 
  i do n't see why that would follow . 
  i said it elsewhere :  look at what the nih is doing : nih-funded researchers can submit to any journals they like , but they also enter their papers into a national database that anyone can access . 
  of course journals can decide to refuse articles that can be accessed like this , but what are they going to do , cut themselves off from the research of every single eu-funded researcher ? 
  this is one instance where having a european-wide policy is beneficial , it gives a ton more bargaining power . 
  in this case if the eu unilaterally decided to implement this policy tomorrow , most publishers would be forced to follow suit ... 
  there are other ways .

  this is one instance where having a european-wide policy is beneficial , it gives a ton more bargaining power . 
  in this case if the eu unilaterally decided to implement this policy tomorrow , most publishers would be forced to follow suit ... 
  in math this sort of practice is already prevalent : you can submit to any journal you like , but before that you put your paper on arxiv , a freely-accessed preprint repository . 
  of course some publishers do n't like this and refuse articles that are on such preprint repositories , but nowadays most researchers put their papers on arxiv first and only then start thinking about what journal to submit to ... 
  so now almost all publishers allow this practice . 
  poor publishers !, 
  they wo n't be able to maintain egregious margins off of volunteer work anymore !, 
  let me outline the steps of scientific publishing for you , in case you do n't know : * scientists write a paper * they submit it to a journal * the editor ( unpaid volunteer ) sends it to peer reviewers * reviewers ( unpaid volunteers ) review the paper and advise the editor on whether to publish it * the editor ( remember , unpaid volunteer ) accepts the paper * now the path fork : * traditionally , at this point the authors hand over the article 's copyright to the publisher . 
  the publisher publishes the article , and sells it to the journal 's subscribers . 
  none of the profits go to the authors , the editor , or the reviewers . 
  * or the journal is `` open access '' , and then the authors hand over the copyright * and pays the publisher * for the privilege of doing so . 
  then the publishers distribute the electronic version of the article freely , and sells printed version of the journal . 
  none of the profits go to the authors , the editor , or the reviewers . 
  now , maybe you do n't see anything wrong with this picture . 
  and yet everyone understands what the title is about . 
  other people have already explained that scientists make zero money from published papers , and sometimes even have to pay to get them published . 
  now let me add that scientists at large are extremely happy about this move . 
  there is nothing more frustrating than finding a reference in some paper you 're reading , looking it up , and realizing that it 's in a journal your university does n't subscribe to . 
  believe it or not , scientists are proud of their work and would show it to everyone if they could . 
   do you know that most journals make researchers pay to publish their articles ? 
  no , that 's not true . 
  it 's heavily dependent on the field , what kind of journal you submit to ... 
  in math , nobody pays to publish . 
  but as far as i know , there is n't a single researcher who makes money off published articles . 
   the conseil d'\u00c9tat was against the burqa law in 2004 . 
  but oh , we still got it . 
  not so unconstitutional i guess . 
  too bad you continued to comment and dug yourself into a hole . 
  ( also , let me repeat what the other commenter said : changing the constitution just to ban burkinis ? 
  you 're deluded . ), 
  reread what you 've written . 
  you wrote :  its quiet easy to speak like this when your state has n't been attacked more then once it 's rather clear that this means `` if your state had been attacked more than once , then you would think differently , i.e. 
  like me '' . 
  how about you inform yourself then ... ? 
  the burkini was n't banned on the same grounds . 
  do you even know how a burkini looks like ? 
  it does n't even cover the face !, 
  how could it have been banned on the same grounds ? 
  if i were you i would refrain from commenting on issues i know nothing about ... 
  seriously , wtf ? 
   so not sure why my view matters here . 
  you wrote :  i assume this ruling would also undo the burqua ban itself so there would be enough support to change the constitution if needed . 
  i 'm explaining to you that this is misguided . 
  your new comment is basically just as misguided , so let me elaborate . 
  there is no `` blanket burqa ban '' . 
  stop thinking that . 
  there is a ban on hiding one 's face in the public space . 
  a burqa covers the face , so it falls under this law , but so does a ski mask . 
  this is a completely different law from `` you can not wear religious attire on the beach because france has recently been the target of terror attacks '' ( this was written like this in the decree ! ) . 
  ca n't you see the difference , and why the first might be compliant with the constitution but not the second one ? 
  you do n't know what you 're talking about . 
  the conseil d'\u00e9tat is the only competent court to rule for cases of `` exc\u00e8s de pouvoir '' ( abuse of power , i guess ) for the decrees of local administrations , here a municipal decree . 
  this includes checking whether these decrees are compliant with the constitution . 
  the constitutional council ( which i 'm pretty sure is what you meant by `` a constitutional court '' ) only judges the constitutionality for the laws passed by the parliament , as well as some decrees made by the president/government or the conseil d'\u00e9tat . 
   did n't know nice was a ` town ' . 
  it 's a medium-sized city . 
  holy shit talk about pedantry . 
  do you think you have more legitimacy because you 're french ? 
  i 'm french and i find that a law that 's basically `` you ca n't wear religious attire to the beach '' is ridiculous . 
  you seriously do n't see a difference between `` you need to show your face in the public space '' and `` you ca n't wear religious attire to the beach '' ? 
  are you seriously suggesting that any politician ( that has any chance of getting elected ) is going to propose a new constitution just to be able to ban burkinis ? 
  are you completely delusional ? 
  did you even read the title ( let alone the article ) ? 
  a few cities banned the burkini , a local court upheld it , but a national court ( and not any court , it 's the highest administrative court and just one step below the country 's highest court ) struck it down . 
  after this there will never be a national ban . 
  this is the absolute worst case scenario obviously ... but even reducing spending by a few percents could be detrimental , you do n't have to be at either extreme end of the scale . 
  the attack in munich was perpetrated by a guy who was proud of being `` super-aryan '' because he was born on the same day as hitler . 
  does that sound sane to you ? 
  the whole interview is ridiculous , too . 
   dr : no , terrorists are not typically mentally ill .  fr24 : what about the nice attacker , who was psychologically unstable according to reports ? 
   dr : he 's an exception . 
   fr24 : and the attacker in ansbach had spent time in a psychiatric hospital . 
   dr : well what can you do , daech recruits from fragile people . 
  fta :  the european commission started an antitrust investigation into sky tv 's contracts with 6 major film studios around the world last july . 
  besides paramount pictures , the eu is also investigating disney , nbcuniversal , sony , twentieth century fox and warner bros for breaching eu competition rules with geoblocking . 
  the title makes it sound like paramount were doing it out of the goodness of their heart ... 
   aka ; blame the eu for things we fucked up with to distract attention . 
  you just described every single uk politician for the past decades . 
  see what happened . 
  that 's exactly what the ecb does .

  i think you 're just talking to scare people with no real study behind this . 
   but unless you close of the borders and become self sustainable internally you do not want inflation and cheap exports , china and even the us will outsell us easaly . 
  nope . 
  we need jobs and cheaper exports . 
  french economy just needs a 3-4 % inflation rate . 
  it 's its structural inflation . 
  you really think all eu countries behave the same do you ? 
  just look at the different partial inflation rates between different euro countries . 
  the common currency increased the differences between countries because we do n't have the same economical structures . 
   we compete with japan , not india , and it 's not a pride thing , it 's just common sense , we can not affort their labor costs . 
  it 's not black or white ... we compete with them on some sectors and products . 
  that 's what was proven in the studies i gave you and why french economy is price sensitive . 
   the uk is fucked , qe basically signed them up for at least 20 years of constant inflationary pressure they can not get rid of . 
  norway literally has the money to print money and not feel a sting . 
  `` the uk is fucked '' ... 
  i 'm not even going to discuss this with you . 
  switzerland intervene specifically because of exchange rates for trade issues . 
   why ? 
  because of economic structures . 
  demographics , job market , level of education , housing , industrial specialization etc. 
  we have a relatively young and growing population so we need a lot more investments than for example germany . 
  just look at these age pyramids : [ france ] ( http://www.alternatives-economiques.fr/__travail/graphique_legends/img.php?id=61706 ) vs [ germany ] ( http://www.alternatives-economiques.fr/__travail/graphique_legends/img.php?id=61707 ) . 
  germany has an old population looking to secure its money . 
  we have a very different situation . 
   economic stagnation is a consequence of lack of vision and developement . 
  european leaders have a long tradition of that . 
  the eu is just a easy target for national politicians to point at . 
  the eu is a consequence of a lack of vision made by european leaders . 
   please explain why does deflation bother you ? 
  http://snbchf.com/economic-theory/deflationary-spiral/  the political issues of the eu are not for me to argue against , we both want to dismantle the epp and create a real democracy at the european level not a luxembourgian plutocracy powered by national politicians greed . 
  agreed . 
  i just do n't think it 's feasible because there 's not such thing as a european people . 
   all of europe has a tradition of submiting to us interests no . 
  france does not . 
   i would argue that as a united front we stand a better chance of saying no , than as individual members . 
  the fact is that we are not united . 
  i do n't think that we 'll ever be . 
  so we are divided , and weaker than if we were able to make our own decisions independently . 
   again imigration is a national issue that is just passed onto the eu . 
  nope , freedom of movement means immigrants in any eu country can come into another . 
   your fight is with local liberals . 
  it 's also with local liberals , but not only with them . 
   blame feminism for demographic stagnation , women happen to have better things to do than have babies in modern societies . 
  there 's no `` better '' thing than to have a baby . 
  it 's a complex issue so i wo n't spend more time on it here . 
   that is just plain stupid , they get money from taxes and are propped up by local goverments that are payed for by taxes . 
  they want your taxes , a lot of them . 
  freedom of movement and different tax legislations allow this . 
  it 's again a proof that we are not united but divided . 
  we are not allies but competitors . 
  the stupid ting was creating a union with no fiscal harmonization . 
  the stupid thing is the eu . 
   i do n't understand that one , how is there a increase in competition and why on earth would that be bad ? 
  it 's [ social dumping ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/social_dumping ) means competition on labour laws . 
  the perfect example is the issue of posted worker . 
  do i really need to explain why it 's bad ? 
   you are the second biggest economy due to servicing a european market nope , we were before the eu existed and would be even if the eu did not . 
  we 're the second most populated nation and have a history of being in the top eu countries . 
  now if you can prove your point with any study i 'd be glad to look at it , but you 're just repeating the same thing over and over and i 'm not convinced at all . 
  we used to perform a lot better before the eu . 
  our balance of trade was positive and our competitiveness was much higher than it is now , because we controlled our monetary policy . 
  in fact our economy is negatively affected by the common currency : http://dea.uib.es/digitalassets/235/235067_w60.pdf http://www.ofce.sciences-po.fr/blog/weaker-euro-likely-mean-french-economy/ anyway , countries in the euro do n't have the [ same structural inflation rates ] ( http://www.fmsh.fr/en/c/1397 ) so it can not work at all without huge fiscal transfers from germany , to high inflation countries . 
   which is only partial because if you want and foreign commerce or investment you ca n't do whatever you want with your currency anyway still it 's better than what we have with the euro . 
  switzerland , norway and the uk do much better thanks to their control . 
   and some increased stability due to the german fobia of inflation as a consequence you have a much more stable currency than you had previously [ we still have a higher partial inflation than germany ] ( http://www.insee.fr/en/indicateurs/analys_conj/archives/march2013_d2.pdf ) , which is hurting us a lot . 
  a 3 % or 4 % inflation rate is good for our economies . 
  a 2 % inflation rate is simply not adapted to our economic structure . 
   you really think you do n't benefit from the being in the eu ? 
  why i hate the european union ? 
  well : * economic stagnation * deflation * unemployment * undemocratic institutions * no respect for the 2005 referendum * no control on immigration * submission to us interests ( ttip etc. ), 
  * demographic stagnation * encouragement of tax fraud and tax evasion * encouragement of fiscal and social competition * lowering of social conditions yes , i think that overall we do n't benefit from being in the eu . 
   and you went down the paranoia train yeah , coming from someone who said `` france would be nothing without eu contracts and agriculture subsidies '' , when in fact we are the 2nd biggest eu net contributor and our economy is deeply penalised by the euro ...  we are so envious of you that we bribe european officials to take ally our money and make you poor like us just read again what you wrote : * that provision is meant to equalise the economic balance , so that our guys can buy more or your crap . 
  * you need the eu and get huge benefits from it , we do n't . 
   that provision is meant to equalise the economic balance , so that our guys can buy more or your crap . 
  or so that our guys are as poor and cheap as yours . 
  well i think i 'm more informed than you . 
  i 've refuted your main points with sources when all you could provide were subjective statements or unsourced affirmations , for example the `` cap specifically benefits france '' when it clearly does not . 
  i did my homework . 
  do yours . 
   you mean a disappointingly large number of people believed the line `` nah we can just unilaterally change the treaty and still get all the good it brings us , the eu wo n't mind '' . 
  so what do you call `` level-headed '' ? 
  agreeing with you ? 
  obeying the politicians ? 
  i believe citizens are equal , so each vote counts the same . 
  i 'm not allowed to do anything but respect the will of the people . 
  moreover in 1992 the swiss rejected eea membership by referendum . 
  once again the politicians had decided against the will of the people and against sovereignty . 
   direct democracy is n't some magic bullet against the people being mislead by dishonest politicians no it 's not and i never said so . 
  but i think that 's its better than having a minority of self-proclaimed experts choosing for the others . 
  once again we can interpret differently the last referendum on immigration quotas : in 2000 and 2005 , the swiss were mislead by their politicians who explained that being in the schengen area and agreeing to the free movement of people would be positive . 
  after a few years of application of these treaties , they realized that what they had been told was wrong so they decided to change the immigration conditions . 
   what 's contentious , here , that switzerland is part of efta or that the eu is utterly dominating it ? 
  i 'd like explanations on both if possible . 
  i 'm just asking for a source or example on the `` gazillions of laws to stay in efta '' . 
   it 's generally not so much `` change position '' but `` influence the first position there is '' . 
  how so ? 
   have you ever had a look at , how , say , cap is organised and how much it specifically benefits france ? 
  well i 'd like more proof on this as i 'm not convinced . 
  some countries in the eu have larger agricultural sectors than others , notably france and spain , and consequently receive more money under the cap . 
  but france is a net contributor in the eu ( [ by more than 8 billion euros ] ( http://www.eu-oplysningen.dk/euo_en/spsv/all/79/ ) in 2012 ) .

  yeah but then the south can not devalue compared to the north . 
  the south of italy really needs help man . 
  see how this perpetuates ? 
  we agreed to a union , italy and france and yes even germany have to make the structural reforms and compromises that could make the union work . 
  enough with the patchwork , which devaluing is . 
   but for mainstream media to talk as if the german or austrian people owe me , or these people something beyond what the german homeless people get , is just disingenuous . 
  can you point in the text where it says that they should have been given more ? 
  it 's a classic soft editorial piece that comments about some aspects of life . 
  we see constantly articles about disillusioned people . 
  disillusioned people that from their small town to the big city to find a job , that move to hollywood to start their acting career etc etc etc. 
  at no point does the reporter imply that hey europe should have sold the clothes off its back to help mohammed get into an engineering school . 
   but lots of things are perfectly human and understandable without being morally justifiable . 
  what is n't morally justifiable ? 
  pretending to be a refugee ? 
  of course . 
  other people who need help are left out of the loop . 
  but let 's look at the reverse , we close our borders , we impose tons of visas and paperwork when we should let people come and see the reality of what europe is . 
  yes there are a ton of shitty buildings , tons of poor people etc etc etc. 
  if that image is shown to people , they 'll realise yeah europe is n't that friggin great . 
  we 've seen it after the wall fell . 
  people thought omg the west . 
  yeah it 's not a dictatorship but you know ... 
  the more we close our borders , the more people will think we 're hiding something special and will want to come in . 
   amnesty/similar organizations and leftist media talking as if only immigrants are allowed to have rational self interest , and not europe well that 's why we have the ring wing media telling us that only europe matters . 
  in between them there 's a balance , do n't you think ? 
  had we made it easier for them to come and see that yeah europe ai n't no rainbow land . 
  the people living in the iron curtain also idolised the west and coca cola . 
  not all circumflex accents replace the lost s. for example \u00e2me was n't asme . 
  ~ ~ it 's kinda weird . 
  ame is closer to the latin anima and the spanish alma or occitan arma . ~ ~ ~ ~ but then again ame looks weird . 
  and it 's not even pronounced like \u00e2me . ~ ~ ~ ~ so in this particular case i am split . ~ ~ ~ ~ concerning the missing s marker . 
  i dunno i kinda think it 's like programming . 
  we 've market the s as deprecated for quite a bit :p . time to move on . ~ ~ ognons looks weird but i think it 's because we 're used to oignons . 
  probably in the future , the french will say yeah it was for the best . 
  edit : actually it wo n't be removed from the `` a '' and from the `` o '' . 
  and it 'll stay on d\u00fb , je\u00fbne , m\u00fbr , s\u00fbr etc. 
  fewer and fewer people . 
  edit : since / u/ygyfygy deleted his message and mine looks weird now , he basically said `` less and less people learn french '' because it 's too difficult . 
  i am amazed . 
  a lot of spain is in pretty warm areas yet the food is so fat  ) wtf . 
  edit : speeling . 
  same date and no no debauchery . 
  some carnivals start in the south of france . 
  they found a chance to go to a different place , and they took it . 
  okay yeah it 's shitty to say you 're a refugee when you 're not , but it 's not like its not understandable . 
  we all try to maximise our personal well being . 
  the euro lost a lot against the dollar almost achieving parity . 
  did the italian economy improve ? 
  dude let 's face you , you dun goofed when changing to z. 
  s between two vowels is pronounced z. 
  that 's how you can tell the difference between desert and dessert without having to wonder is it two s 's or just one ? 
  their s comes from french . 
  heck why did n't you change desert to dezert ? 
   the change may be gradual but eventually we 'd have as much geopolitical importance as a place like vietnam or kenya . 
  do u mean uk will descend to the level of vietnam ? 
  or will vietnam rise to the level of uk ? 
  because that 's not the same thing . 
  hijacking this thread . 
  can someone find the part of the episode the germans from fawlty towers when basil says that now that uk is in the common market , they 'll try their best . 
  `` part of the continent now . '', 
  it was filmed 3 years after uk joined . 
  * mais on s ` en fout . 
   do tell them the procedure about asylum seeking , they have to either accepter their application or d\u00e9port them out of schengen . 
  that 's dublin . 
   the eu said to let them pass , after the screenings . 
  yes , bad decisions all around . 
  did n't they already give sanctions to austria during the haider period ? 
   https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2000/02/haid-f22.html?view=article_mobile wan na see a country that does n't respect international agreements : russia . 
  they 're not doing 100 % awesomely, 
   many are maghrebins . 
  as per tusk , if i recall well , are either maghrebins or iraq/iran/afghan etc nationals . 
  the calais migrants are maghrebins ? 
  dude . 
  they 're afghans , pakistan , erithreans , etc. 
   is it impossible that they just come by plane or by boat , legally ? 
  what visa ? 
   also , lebanon and jordan , as far as i know do n't have 30 % unemployment total and 50 % for the youth . 
  wait are you saying lebanon and jordan are better than greece ? 
   however you ca n't blame other countries that did their job i thought we established that they did n't . 
  you are country of entry for an illegal immigrant in the schengen space ? 
  you register and ask them to apply for asylum or you deport them . 
  now we have calais that will be a perpetual problem as long as schengen states do n't do their job . 
  we can deport them , but they 'll still come , more and more . 
   as if the calais migrants came from the greece/italy route in the first place . 
  where did they come from !, 
  honestly dude sheesh . 
   unless if you mean we force them . 
  we get them pull then out if schengen . 
  simple . 
   force migrant to apply for asylum in the country they do n't want to , in a country that ca n't sustain itself . 
  the vast majority of migrants are in jordan and lebanon . 
  are those countries better off than greece ? 
   in france we act high but we ca n't fucking sort out une putain de banlieu . 
  we can sort the gypsies . 
  off to romania . 
  when we 're talking about calais omg let 's not touch them . 
  wtf is that ? 
  look when the first camp started . 
  you 'll see an off correlation with schengen . 
   france ?

   i think this is probably what african americans feel like having to live with white people . 
   the enemy is everywhere . 
  ( he does n't like this sub apparently , but it 's a very important sub ) :  democracy in both nations is just a facade . 
  it does n't exist . 
  it 's not real . 
  it 's just another system for the rich to rig . 
  they use the internet to help them . 
  the internet does n't expand freedom . 
  it steifles it . 
  the downvotes on this very sub are proof of that . 
  this subreddit is being used as ground zero for a propaganda machine that runs far and wide whose entire goal is to ensure the status quo and make sure that the rich keep getting richer and the poor keep getting poorer . 
   varoufakis gets that . 
  i get that . 
  this guy does n't quit . 
  he 's funny , but he seems too earnest to be a troll . 
  no , i 'm just spouting the opposite of what i really think because i hate greeks . 
  what a rambling mess of nonsense . 
  `` boo hoo , they would n't give as much as we were willing to take . '', 
  thanks , we got that from the failure of negotiations . 
  it 's not blackmail to point to point out that greece will be in a shit position if she does n't get the continued support of the eurozone . 
  you overplayed a very weak hand , as many greece-critical people have said on this board . 
  do n't blame everyone else for getting called on it . 
  wrong . 
   [ 1 ] ( http://www.igmchicago.org/igm-economic-experts-panel/poll-results?surveyid=sv_bg4hvaj9app4yzx ) , [ 2 ] ( http://www.igmchicago.org/igm-economic-experts-panel/poll-results?surveyid=sv_4hkng0ow1nafpej ) , [ 3 ] ( http://www.igmchicago.org/igm-economic-experts-panel/poll-results?surveyid=sv_0ng4fuw3lrdjh2r ) , [ 4 ] ( http://www.igmchicago.org/igm-economic-experts-panel/poll-results?surveyid=sv_1fcagupfnlylbno )  these answers obviously only reflect the specific questions and not the general consensus on economic policy-making . 
   long story short : no clear picture . 
  even if there is a slight majority one way or another `` uncertain '' is usually the most prominent answer . 
  credit / u/miltton greece episode vi : electric boogaloo . 
  they are back ... for more money ... only this time ... it 's different !, 
  weak stuff . 
  all he said he did was attacking his political enemies and their supporters . 
  do n't get me wrong , it 's fine to attack people who act illegaly . 
  but it 's not exactly a tough decision for his party , and it 's not enough to make greece 's finances viable . 
  you can easily imagine , that for example , if the right-wing was in power in greece right now they would go after a corrupt union . 
   who the fuck talks like that to anyone ? 
  have you ever seen a parliamentary debate before ? 
  this is how they talk . 
  what do you expect them to do ? 
  exchange smalltalk , pose for an official picture , and head home without hearing any arguments that might hurt their feelings ? 
  we have enough of those summits already . 
  you seem reasonable when you 're not talking about your beliefs . 
  it 's a tragedy that reasonable people can be hoodwinked and blackmailed into supporting such a fucked up belief system . 
   i 'm willing to talk but this subreddit has a timelimit which is annoying . 
  it 's a feature of reddit . 
  if your comments get downvoted , then the 10 min limit kicks in . 
  it 's annoying . 
  there 's a way around it , sometimes . 
  you can ask the mods of / r/europe to put you on their `` approved commenters '' list , that removes the limit on the sub . 
  but sometimes mods use that list for other purposes . 
   the hadiths ( written later but are important ) assigned punishment which include deaths . 
  i am aware of that . 
  this is one of those rules that could never be accepted here . 
  between the apostate and the muslim who wants to kill him , we will take the side of the apostate . 
  this would be true for any religion that seeks to kill its apostates . 
  there can be no compromise on this . 
  so if islam is set for all eternity , our cultures are on a collision course . 
   i 've seen people come up with incredibly shitty reasoning for doing what they do . 
  like a thief who told me that it was ok to steal as long as it was only from non-muslims . 
  your prophet routinely stole from and killed nonmuslims for no other reason than them being nonmuslims . 
  he was no better than genghis khan , whose thirst for blood the muslims experienced ( along with many asians and some europeans ) . 
  muhammad and his followers massacred nonmuslims , including a large number of christians , in the same way , for the same reasons : greed and power . 
  it is highly likely that you are a descendant of people who were defeated , massacred and raped by muslims . 
  you are being kept into this cult by fear of being killed by your conquerors , just like it was in the beginning of the conquest , yet now you identify with them . 
  it 's sad . 
  i personnally ca n't see much difference between isis and the actions of your prophet , whose deeds are apparently set in stone for all eternity . 
  you , and most muslims , are better than this . 
  i 'm sure some message boards say strange things , although i 've never seen anyone espousing those ideas . 
  the commenter i was responding to however , talked about `` this board '' , ie / r/europe . 
  so it will only destroy one percent of the jobs it affects ? 
  that seems extremely low to me . 
  and if a crash comes , you 're guaranteed huge unemployment , thanks to this nonsense . 
  you got out of the crisis easy last time . 
  i do n't know how much people will lose their jobs , but i will say this : unemployment is not something easily brushed aside , a little trade-off one can make for some other small benefit . 
  i 'm no marxist at all , but there is a kernel of truth to the `` reserve army of labour '' . 
  the more unemployed there are , the more competition there is for new jobs , the higher the stresses on those who are employed . 
  you ca n't quit that job you hate because you know you 'll have trouble finding another one . 
  even a small effect on unemployment can have a large effect on everyone . 
  it have trouble understanding what it is you 're saying . 
   the religions view towards black people should stay the same . 
   if it did change then it would be called into question . 
  are you saying that a religion 's views on things such as slavery , death for apostasy , random evil shit , should not change , or else it would show that the religion is false ? 
  so the mormons , by changing their view of black people , have shown that their religion is false . 
  and islam , by never changing its view on anything , is `` pure '' ? 
  edit : yep , i guess that was what he meant . 
  every horrible act muhammad did and approved of is kosher for all time , no discussion possible . 
  i do n't know why i 'm still trying with these `` moderate muslims '' . 
  i should just ask them directly about death for apostasy from the start instead of hinting and trying to see a moderate position that is n't there , that would save me some time . 
   these guys do n't share the faith and do n't see how absurd it is for a believer to suddenly change their faith to fit the current environment . 
  200 years ago it was considered normal to think black people as less than human and a 100 years ago they were still looked down upon . 
  imagine changing your religious view on black people as society changes . 
  it would look absurd and take away any credibility . 
  i 'm sorry , what ? 
  so the slaver who thinks slavery is religiously prescribed should be allowed to not only keep up his slave-owning , but it should also not be directly criticized , because it would `` look absurd and take away any credibility '' ? 
   her problem is that they are n't liberal and waving a rainbow flag . 
  that will never happen . 
  yeah , well , that 's a problem . 
  how far does their illiberalism go ? 
  do they hate democracy , jews , homosexuals , apostates , like some of their `` brothers '' ? 
   this is n't really up for discussion . 
   this rule was started up a long time ago and is older than most muslim sects . 
  plenty of old rules were absolute shit and have no place in a modern democracy .

  what if i do n't like muslims and blacks , that 's my right ! '', 
  attitude that they transfer to `` i hate taxes and the state telling me what to do !, 
  also those unions are just lazy jerks blocking people from going to work ! '' . 
  racists , usually , are economically liberal . 
  implying liberals ca n't be racist or racists are n't usually liberal . 
  i read that in his voice . 
  hollande 's left stance was just that , a stance , to get indecisive left-wing voters to vote for him in the first round . 
  it worked well , and he did n't even try to honor anything . 
  combating tax evasion is only a matter of will . 
  tax fraud investigators are the most productive job in the public service , making the state far more than what they cost , but successive governments have reduced their numbers because ideology . 
  you increase their numbers and pass laws that will chase tax evading people and corporations to the end of the earth and they will have nowhere to hide . 
  liberal centrists fear-mongering and fake moral high ground . 
   de-escalation will only further embolden russia as they only respect strength . 
  how they respond to nato planting missiles at their border being the proof !, 
  a far-right candidate will be bad for non-whites , women , secular people . 
  a `` far-left '' candidate will be bad for tax evading billionaires and corporations . 
  totally the same thing , right ? 
  `` maybe if i throw scary words around something will stick ! '', 
  wish it would have spent more time on each top four instead of being a `` anything but le pen '' piece ( and i hate her , i just dislike this approach to the election ) , but i guess given the show and the density of the subject it 's okay . 
  `` institut montaigne '' is a liberal think tank that spends its year lamenting how much money we spend , its not a neutral source and journalists should know better . 
  you 're either trying to say that if france was more liberal things would be so great there would be no need to fight for or defend workers rights , or that strikes would be outlawed or impossible due to the slave-like condition of workers . 
  lol and yikes . 
  if he does what he promised as well . 
  we 'll get her anyway if he wins . 
  because le pen having anything left-wing and m\u00e9lenchon and le pen being able to find common ground is liberal bullshit that gets repeated to frighten people who base their vote on medias and superficial appraisal . 
  if you go by traditional party logic , you 'd be right . 
  but as we can see , traditional parties are having a hard time . 
  they 're going to lose the presidential election , and people might vote outside the traditional parties in order to avoid the deadlock you mention . 
  a significant portion of lr ( fillon ) express similar interests in liberal economic policies and discriminatory laws as the fn and they 'd have no difficulty forming an alliance of interest . 
  the fn will claim to have a big victory and lr will claim to temper the fn and avoided a catastrophe but voting necessary measures . 
  the socialist party is going to be decimated at the legislative election . 
  the left is going to have to rally behind candidates that have the common support of m\u00e9lenchon 's movement , the greens , various left-wing party and civil society . 
  they 'll doubtfully have a majority but could have a group significant enough to matter . 
  the ps candidates are backed by the party , not hamon , and were mostly mindless bots during hollande 's presidency , with the exception of a few troublemakers that hamon was part of . 
  if le pen is elected , they 'll have their group and all , liberals and troublemakers alike , play the frightened virgin as if the last 5 years did n't happen and they were n't responsible . 
  if m\u00e9lenchon is elected , they 'll probably also have their group but a more significant portion than today will disobey instruction and as a whole m\u00e9lenchon should have a working majority with it 's mps , the ps ones and a few progressive/pragmatic centrist . 
  if macron is elected , they 'll worship him . 
  the big unknown if m\u00e9lenchon is elected , is how much mps can he get and how much can he mobilize civil society to pressure the rest of the mps into not blocking him too much . 
  the comment is a bit all over the place but hopefully it gives some insight . 
  edit : to answer the question not asked , if macron is elected he 'll have the whole support of what remains of socialist mps , he 'll have the centrists that should be a bit more than today but nothing fabulous , and he 'll have most of lr vote if he needs them . 
  the important part is to remember that macron 's whole pitch is that he 's a liberal , but that he 'll sprinkle some welfare so that 's okay . 
  he will definitely have a majority for his liberal policies , but it 's more doubtful for the welfare . 
  he knows that , and will probably be very careful to separate the liberal and welfare policies he wants to pass to not get blocked . 
  you 'll get all the liberalism and none of the welfare or anything left-wing . 
  so imagine what it would be if we were . 
  i do n't envy the us health care , that 's for sure . 
  maybe only in the matter of workers being unionized , germany is much better at that than france . 
  there 's the position and the direction . 
  france is undeniably more socialist in its position compared to most european countries , but is absolutely and unapologetically on a liberal path since 1983 . 
  liberalism working so great since 1983 . 
  right , so my take is instead of giving free money to employers and they do nothing with it , we give free money to workers and see if it 's better . 
  i 'm not liberal , but my understanding is that liberals think individuals know what they want and make better decisions anyway , so surely it ca n't be that bad . 
  you not believing he can do it is one thing , but his opponents program is literally `` free money for employers and hopefully they create jobs . 
  btw that 's what we 've been doing for 40 years yet here we are but this time it 's totally going to work '' , so you tell me how this time it 's going to be different . 
   liberal  welfare pick one .

  you know how we get the occasional ridiculous story out of north korea and everyone mocks the glorious leader while we 're left wondering if the story is really true or if it 's just believable propaganda ? 
  well now we have the same with the white house . 
  `` why debate in good faith when i can be pedantic '' -- you,

  nah , french people just consider their president 's love/sex life as gossip , not a moral hard line . 
  the eurosceptic/pro-european classification is widely unnecessary . 
  appropriate reaction .

  the '' '' `` left '' '' '' . 
  increase eu institutions accountability to its citizen , increase citizens involvement in the eu institutions so they feel they have a handle on them . 
  simple measure : vote for eu-wide lists in european elections rather than national lists . 
  the leader of the top list in the leading coalition becomes the commission president . 
  it makes parties of europe unite and converge more , and people try to both understand other countries politics more and who the list leaders are . 
  knowing your neighbors and representatives is important in feeling less like the power is taken from you . 
  other simple measure : if 10 % eu citizens sign a petition , a eu-wide referendum is held to censor the eu commission . 
  numbers and intricacies debatable so its a fair process , you get the gist . 
  that means the eu commission and other institutions will have to communicate more directly to citizens , and they 'll have to be more careful about the sentiment that they 're screwing citizens over . 
  if taking place , such a referendum would be a formidable occasion to debate what is wrong , what adjustment we need to make , and if eu citizens do agree to change the direction or are satisfied with how things are handled . 
  i can guarantee you that people signing the referendum but losing will get much more involved on a national level to make sure their country puts pressure , so win-win . 
  i could continue but you get the idea . 
  the problem is not that the eu does n't communicate well and that people who dislike the current eu are dumb or uninformed . 
  the eu is n't simple , and if there is a problem it 's its responsibility to address it honestly instead of blaming citizens . 
  i mean , to me left-wing liberal is an oxymoron , but if your personal political scale separates both then consider it does encompass both . 
  i 'm saying that you will have a harder time reconciling people to your subjective perception of facts and point of view than making real change that will easily convince people . 
  debatable and does n't make a difference in people 's sentiment , which is what matters when we 're talking about support . 
  take that sentiment at face value and do something to change it instead of telling them what they 're feeling is wrong . 
  i 'm sure you understand the irony of what you 're saying compared to people asking for their country being able to make its own decisions instead of it being dictated by outside powers , i.e. 
  the eu . 
  hmmm yeah , it 's well known people shift blame to the benevolent imf instead of their own government . 
  if by that you mean we need to distinguish pro-eu and `` good for eu citizens '' , i agree . 
  oh i 'd much rather we adapt and change it , but if we ca n't agree on what it 's supposed to do anymore i would prefer a concerted peaceful dismantlement than countries leaving one by one on bad terms . 
  and social prosperity . 
  like , idgaf about being a global power if it means domestic poverty and inequality . 
  i think it would have . 
  but lets say you 're right . 
  it does n't mean changing radically the eu today would lead to war . 
  it does n't even mean softly dismantling the eu today would lead to war . 
  what could lead to war is pretending the eu works fine and letting resentment between countries grow , until one blows up , elects angry nationalists and points its weapons around . 
  and saying it 's because of the eu instead of just being tired of wars after two world wars and being a very different society is wishful thinking . 
  i could even be cheeky and say that we 've steered away from armed war but the eu institutionalized economic war between it 's countries , and today a few winners are gaining political hold on the losers without having to invade .

  these differences carried to the speakers of the 2 groups and influenced their culture and values . 
  this lasted until the 16th century , when the king ordered french ( which had gained a lot of influence through the king and paris ) to be the mandatory language for law and administration in all of france . 
  his goal was to reduce the influence of the church by forcing it to switch to `` french '' . 
  the side effect was that the oc languages also died . 
  at this point france was just recovering from the 100 years ' war and the strong divisions that had weakened the kingdom . 
  the single language played a big role in the construction of france , both in the 16th century and during the revolution . 
  the situation now is a result of our history . 
  yup , and people will do the same with smartphones and tablets if this tax is voted into law . 
  in the end , french retailers , and the french economy will suffer more and our politicians will complain about ze germans killing our balance of trade . 
  yes , it 's from the finnish word . 
  back when i was learning the language a few years ago , i was often daydreaming at work , so a finnish coworker taught me the word . 
  i think it 's a beautiful word and it kinda stuck with me ... 
  the bus and tram drivers of marseille plan to go on strike for one day in june because they do n't like the new pants that have been designed for them . 
  i 'm one of the young , educated and unemployed . 
  i graduated last year , master 's degree , tourism stuff . 
  and i just ca n't find a job . 
  some of my classmates are in the same situation . 
  some are working low level jobs that are vaguely related to our field of studies . 
  interim , part time jobs ... 
  the real problem is that there are lots of jobs that are posted everyday that i could do , but they are internships . 
  now all junior positions are filled by interns . 
  marketing assistant , junior sales executive , all of these jobs that i could do perfectly are intern only . 
  a regular job costs at least ~ $ 1500/month to a company , while an intern only costs $ 430/month . 
  all schools and universities have made internships mandatory . 
  i had to do 3 of them myself , and i was really happy to find them , but now i think that most companies are just exploiting interns year round , they would rather hire and train a cheap intern twice a year rather than get someone long term . 
  and for regular contracts , companies ask for 2-5 years experience , so if you 've just graduated , you ca n't do internships anymore and you ca n't get a regular job , so you just end up getting shitty jobs on 6 months contract until you find someone crazy enough to hire you . 
   kids in norway are barely expected to sing the national anthem on constitution day . 
  while i agree that patriotism in america often goes too far , it saddens me that in many european countries , kids do n't know the lyrics of the national anthem , or that waving your country 's flag means you support the local extreme-right party . 
  on april 1st the mods of / r/murica and / r/france decided to swap control of both subreddits , so murica took over france and liberated it , while france took over murica and oppressed it . 
  it was hilarious and cringe worthy at the same time to see muricans losing their shit when they saw it . 
  most of them could n't take the joke . 
  i thought this subreddit was satire , but it 's not . 
  yes it is possible , especially when you consider that mayors have authority over this ( which is why in historically communist towns you 'll find many karl marx or lenin streets ) . 
  but it is usually more common to have streets/schools named after war personalities such as de gaulle , cl\u00e9menceau , roosevelt , jean moulin or churchill , or dates like november 11th or march 19th . 
  roosevelt even has a metro station in paris named after him , and de gaulle a whole airport . 
  even p\u00e9tain had many streets named after him until a few years ago . 
  other french politicians do n't have such a legacy ( mitterrand has the national library , pompidou a museum , other than that , simone veil ... who else ? 
  these streets are in honor of the war leaders , not the politicians . 
  cool pic !, 
  from space it kinda looks like a rotated version of [ bordeaux ] ( http://www.5minutesatuer.com/medias/bordeaux-vue-espace-chris-hadfield.jpg ) !,

  but it 's sunny enough that shadows are cast on the ground !!!!!, 
  and it 's 8 \u00b0 !!!!, 
  that 's the best weather we 've had all week !, 
  damn , that sentence in danish starts out all nice and easy , and when you think you 're gon na understand everything it switches to hard mode :(, 
  i do n't get your # 1 point at all . 
  france does n't act like an empire anymore . 
  our intervention in mali is the exception , not the rule . 
  we managed to remain out of the iraq mess and only went to afghanistan through nato , and we will leave soon . 
  if we do n't control our foreign policy , then who does ? 
  what makes you think that we have too much power ( over what ? ) ? 
  what are we doing wrong ? 
  what do you want us to do ? 
  personnally my 2 things would be : stop electing people on their ego or the political party they represent and instead elect them on merit and achievements . 
  be more open to change and innovation . 
  be more flexible . 
  science , politics , economy , we must stop being afraid of change and clinging on our traditions . 
  there 's too much economic pressure , bureaucracy and bad morale . 
  we ca n't let our young investors and scientists leave the country because we 're not willing to make much needed reforms on many different subjects . 
  why are you posting news from 4 months ago ? 
  that 's another problem : the quality of education regarding foreign languages in france is very bad . 
  somehow our teachers and the people who write the curriculums think that making our kids learn irregular verbs and vocabulary lists from outdated books while completely neglecting oral and grammar skills is the way to go . 
  things like the absence of stress in french do n't help either . 
  but i have never seen any student refusing to learn english or claiming that people from other countries should learn french before english . 
  similarly , i went to poland not long ago and people sucked at speaking english there , does that mean they are language patriots ? 
  i do n't think so . 
  what i mean is that a mep 's bad command of english should n't be held against him . 
  if people want to use english as the common language , fine , but it should n't become something mandatory in the parliament . 
  language should not become a factor of how we chose our meps . 
  i do n't want people with good ideas to bet set aside because they ca n't speak english , like it is implied in the video . 
  and , * again * , my original message has nothing to do with the status of the french language . 
  people need to stop putting words into our mouths . 
  french people do n't care about french being the dominant language in the eu or whatever . 
  i 'm tired of this stereotype of french people who refuse to learn foreign languages and who want french to be spoken everywhere , it may have been true , but it 's now completely outdated . 
  ( i 'm not talking about you in particular , it 's just a global thing ) . 
  i personally do n't give a damn that meps do n't want to speak french and that they would rather speak english . 
  french is not a special language , and i do n't see why it should be treated as a special language . 
  now , with that said , i do n't see why english should be treated as a special language either . 
  if meps want to use it , fine , but they should n't be forced to , and people should n't stop paying attention when somebody else is talking in his home language . 
  also , that french journalist , please do n't think that his opinion is the opinion of all french people . 
  some people here are making absurd generalisations . 
  the issue with romania and schengen is n't romanians emigrating to other eu countries , it 's people from * outside * the eu taking advantage of romania 's weak border control to enter the eu illegally and then travel freely . 
  it 's apparently much easier to enter the eu from the ukraine-romania border than the ukraine-poland one for example . 
  france : the * education physique et sportive * ( sport and physical education , commonly called eps ) is obligatory throughout primary school , college and lyc\u00e9e ( high school ) , so roughly from age 6 to 18 . 
  in primary school there are various sports , swimming , tennis , gymnastics , running . 
  if the school or the town has the facilities for specific sports , they can be taught ( i did fencing in prim school ) . 
  it 's usually 3 hours a week with the regular teacher or a dedicated one . 
  usually grades are assigned according to defined objectives ( for example , running 100m in less than 20s : 1pt - in less than 17s : 2pts - in less than 15s : 3 pts , etc ) usually the final grade is either out of 10 or a letter for young kids so that a bad grade does n't penalise them . 
  college : mostly the same sports , usually there is more track & field stuff ( long jump , endurance running , disc throwing ... ) and collective sports ( handball , badminton ... ) . 
  the year is cut in 3 parts ( trimesters ) , so for example you 'll do 2 sports for the 1st trimester , 2 others for the 2nd , etc. 
  once again , if there are facilities for it , schools can offer stuff like kayaking or climbing . 
  i remember doing dancing or circus arts too ( and i hated it : / ) . 
  3/4 hours a week always with a dedicated teacher that holds a diploma for it . 
  again , it 's scored according to levels and you get a grade out of 20 that counts towards your global grade . 
  lyc\u00e9e : mostly the same as college . 
  a wide variety of sports . 
  trimesters system with a rotation in activities chosen ( not all classes do the same things during the year ) . 
  mostly the same system for grades . 
  2 hours a week for 3 years . 
  at the end of lycee ( 3rd year , age 18 ) you must pass the baccalaur\u00e9at diploma , where you get grades on all classes , so sports is part of it , but it is the only class where you are graded throughout the year ( no special thing at the end of the year ) , and students get to chose a 3 sport set from a pre-determined list , so kinda like cable channels , for example if you want badminton , you also have to do running and gymnastics .

in the end war is often a numbers game ukraine would win the numbers game because every able bodied man would go fight . 
  in a nation of 45 million people , that 's a lot of fighters . 
  additionally , every able bodied woman would be there out at the field hospital helping take of the wounded or would be tended to logistical needs 24/7 . 
  ukraine , despite its lack of wealth , is home to a very well educated populace ( rates of education on par with that of wealthy countries ) . 
  ukraine also produces a disproportionately high amount of scientific research for a country of its demographics . 
   or the entire period of 2014-2018 . 
  you do know that they are only 1 year into this period , right ? 
   they will raise the pension age good . 
  i do n't know why this is seen as being so evil . 
  no it was not done to purposely plot against russia , we are seeing oil prices plummet because american entrepreneurs developed technology that allowed them to extract massive amounts of previously unusable oil in the american midwest and canada . 
  the influx of the midwestern american and canadian oil created a glut in world oil supply . 
  combine this glut of supply with falling demand from europe because of its sluggish recovery , and you get a perfect storm of low oil prices . 
  it 's one of those `` news of the weird '' stories . 
  bbc ca n't be all `` isis and putin '' 24/7 , ya know . 
  my biggest annoyance is that pakistan is training with nato . 
  pakistan and its military are terrible institutions and should be shunned by the civilized world . 
  yup , * la civilisation berb\u00e8re * seems to have a bright , europeanesque future . 
  which is only natural since they were euro-focused for thousands of years , until the islamic conquests . 
  for example , there was an entire dynasty of roman emperors who were * berb\u00e8re * , the [ severids ] ( http://i.imgur.com/lfnctqu.jpg ) . 
  was it worth it ? 
  we shall see . 
  france had an age of tumult after her revolution , i 'm not sure why we should expect libya to be any different . 
  another reason why it may have been worth it is that it did take gaddafis forces out of the chaos . 
  this is good because that prevents the rebel militias from developing into stronger forces via gaining valuable war experience against a traditional army . 
  one of the reasons we saw isis and al -- nusra front become such deadly fighting forces was because they were engaged ( and still are ) in a long , intense campaign against the traditional armed forces of bashar al -- assad which honed them as fighting forces . 
  the same phenomenon happened in the 1980 's with the mujahideen in afghanistan as they fought the soviets . 
  i have great admiration for the portuguese and the astounding achievements that the portuguese people have made .

  yes , the money china has invested in ukraine may be peanuts for the chinese dragon ; but the yield of those investments are no small thing . 
  china has a massive population , that is ever consuming more and more . 
  china 's agricultural output is strained to produce enough food to feed this burgeoning population - especially as china 's rural farmers move into urban areas and start becoming net food consumers rather than net food producers . 
  that 's where ukraine comes in . 
  as is known ukraine 's thick , loamy , black * chernozem * soil is the most fertile soil on earth . 
  china needs the output of ukraine 's * chernozem * to fulfill is agricultural needs . 
  who the hell is talking about poor little hungary ? 
  contrary to whatever your backwards belief is , hungary is not that poor . 
  also we are talking about the sale of an energy company to the kremlin . 
  the kremlin has long been using energy as a way to manipulate europe and to give russia another tool to do so is a threat to all of europe , hungary included . 
  keep in mind that this deal is being brokered by corrupt hungarian politicians not by honest hungarian entrepreneurs . 
  that 's a terribly misguided view . 
  the global economy is so intertwined that if something negatively effects europe , it negatively effects the united states . 
  look how the collapse of greece had huge repurcussions on the u.s. also why do you think nato exists and why the us puts so many resources into europe 's defense ? 
  why would the us do all this to protect and reinforce europe if it was in the us 's interest to see europe fall ? 
  the title * should * read `` france and germany are mounting a diplomatic offensive ... '' why we europeans are n't taking care of this problem ourselves is beyond me . 
  it 's time to stop pussy-footing around and waiting for the united states to do all our heavy lifting . 
  people complain about being america 's `` poodle '' but this is our fault . 
  we are the ones who chose to become poodles instead of rottweilers . 
   do n't try to tell me the us does its business less dirty ... 
  this is n't about who does business the dirtiest , this is about a strategic move to prevent a business deal that would ultimately lead to greater instability in europe . 
  america is no saint , but right now we europeans ought to be more focused on how the russian bear is trying to dig its claws deeper and deeper into europe 's flesh . 
  europe has dozens of fta 's with parties throughout the world , the only reason this is making such a ruckus is because this is an fta with the united states . 
  so let 's be honest , the reason why the far left opposes ttip is because of blatant , hysterical anti-americanism . 
  fta 's have showed us europeans , time and time again , that they are economically healthy and lead to prosperity for all economic classes . 
  yes , there are brief `` adjustment periods '' after fta 's come into force that are difficult for some , but this difficulty dissolves as soon as economies adjust to the new dynamic . 
  europe really needs the economic boost this would provide . 
   middle ages  30 years war want to know what those two things have in common ? 
  they happened in the past in a society that was radically different than our modern day societies .

   also , would n't the uk decrease its power on the political arena in the world in sizes if it leave the eu ? 
  they would probably be freed to buddy up even closer to their anglosphere family thing with america , australia , new zealand and canada . 
  sounds like a horrid idea . 
  these people who go to fight for daesh / isis are downright mad , and while some of them may be truly repentant , i would n't put it past a whole lot of them to feign repentance so they can continue operations in europe . 
  i just do n't trust anyone that is associated with isis / daesh at all . 
  lulz, 
  so ... why is it bad that usa capitalist is offering a box of eggs ? 
  communists do n't like eggs ? 
  if you saw it flying irl you would n't think that . 
  if they got their shit together , they could successfully market themselves as such . 
  provided daesh does n't destroy all of the ancient ruins first . 
  but it 's legacy is not gone because there are numerous archaeological sites , genetic markers etc. 
  also carthage has a history under roman rule as well and one can quite clearly draw a line from punic carthage to roman carthage to vandal carthage to the arab conquests to medieval tunisia to french tunisia to modern day tunisia, 
  well whatever you want to say about it , it 's certainly has the potential to paint itself as the successor to carthage for tourism purposes . 
  in case people do n't know , modern day tunisia is the successor to ancient carthage . 
  tunis is to carthage what athens is to classical athens or what london is to londinium . 
  [ tunis-carthage ] ( http://i.imgur.com/rpsb1bn.jpg ) [ aeroport de tunis carthage ] ( http://i.imgur.com/oukmven.jpg ) edit : the country is named after an ancient punic goddess , tanith / tannou whose latin name is tunus ... http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/tanit, 
  you mean the dictators had more secular ideas about religion . 
  and your argument is quite wrong because states that have the us 's ire are wild islamic states like somalia , yemen , afghanistan and the pakistani tribal areas . 
  i was going to say that this would be a better idea if they were celebrating he anniversary of their opium wars with china , 
  but hat is in large part due to russian destabilization which would disappear with romanian security, 
  yea it does , there 's a war going on and she 's rooting for the other side . 
  they did n't beat the shit out of her or kill her , just humiliated her . 
  that 's really not significant for this . 
  we both know that there are a shit ton of neo-nazis in that part of the world , on * both * sides . 
  language and culture . 
  i 'm mean , belarusian ukrainian serbian and russian are not that dissimilar just as english scottish welsh and irish are not that dissimilar . 
  too bad russia does n't have a relationship with belarus , ukraine and serbia like the us has with britain , australia and canada . 
  i think the analogy is valid . 
  the anglo family seems to get along a lot better than the slavic brothers . 
  the ottomans flew the same flag of muhammed as isis in their vienna campaign . 
  it 's a part of the whole global caliphate thing . 
  osama bin laden , a saudi , expressly states that he chose september 11 as the date for his attacks because the siege of vienna occurred on september 11 . 
  september 11 1683 marked the decisive end of islamic conquests . 
  osama bin laden wanted september 11 2001 to usher in a new era of islamic conquests .

   no fucking way . 
  french people chronically refuse to learn english . 
  that is such bullshit . 
  that we suck at it because we 're not exposed to it , yes , but this idea that the french refuse to learn english only exists in the minds of paranoid foreigners , imo . 
  has n't it always ? 
  does n't look like it worked ... 
  never heard of any of this , but i know you 're a very nationalistic catalan , so of course you 'll know every single thing from every part of catalonia . 
  because it 's in english ? 
  there are n't a lot of italians and spaniards either . 
  you have tons of people from germanic/nordic europe because it 's much easier for them to learn english . 
  not to mention the constant french/parisian bashing on reddit , i 'm not sure the few french people who come here would want to stay . 
  have you ever been to marseille , instead of judging stuff based on some random france-bashing article from the british media ? 
  it 's a pretty nice city . 
  because there are * very * few people from france on reddit , and most of them seem to be american expats living in paris . 
  i could n't find find anyone living in the french riviera even though it is a rich region with tons of people . 
  the french subreddits are mostly dead , except / r/france and / r/paris and even these subreddits ' activity is pretty low ... / r/grandsud ( for southern france , which ` french catalonia ' is a part of ) is mostly dead . 
  and ` french catalonia ' is a very small region with a pretty low population . 
  hell , i did n't even know it existed before reading this post ( to me , catalonia was in spain , but it indeed seems that a very small part of catalonia is considered to be in france ) . 
  it 's going to be hard to find someone from there on reddit :p, 
  to be fair , nobody really burnt homes from what i understand . 
  the roms were urged to leave , left , and people burnt the few things they left behind on the next day . 
  you ca n't really judge stuff like this based on one isolated event . 
  data point ! = statistic . 
  edit : also , it 's easy to judge the people who did this , but it 's probably not that simple if you 're in their position . 
  you 're in a decent neighborhood , and all of a sudden , roms come and set up tents illegally right next to your apartment building on some unbuilt parcel , which makes everything dirty in the neighborhood due to them not having any facilities like access to the sewers or water ... not to mention that they just arrived and probably have no way to sustain themselves other than illegal means ... 
  which leads to stuff getting stolen . 
  it 's understandable how the neigborhood can be pissed , and i do n't think it has much to do with race . 
  now what they did is n't the solution , but it 's a complicated situation . 
  what ? 
  `` tsiganes '' is just how you say `` roma '' in french , it 's pretty neutral . 
  you can also say `` roms '' but i do n't think it 's less ( or more ) offensive . 
   if france will use threat to secular values as reason , they should expel lots of catholic priests and alternative medicine practitioners . 
  they are bigger threat to secular values than islam . 
  erm , have you ever been to france ? 
  it 's not like catholic priests manage to convince a lot of people here . 
  indigenous algerian people were n't granted full french citizenship though ... 
  in any case , i guess it 's just a translation issue , in french `` colonie '' usually refers to old-fashioned , oppressive colonies . 
  it would be a bit shocking to use it for r\u00e9union . 
  dunno , i would n't call these colonies . 
  to me it 's a colony when there 's inequality and oppression to a degree . 
  all r\u00e9union citizens are full french citizens , so i 'd say it 's fully part of france ? 
  nobody in r\u00e9union wants independence , come on now . 
  there was an estimation of about 350 a few months ago . 
  if you think muslims = burqa you need to educate yourself . 
  it 's way less than a minority , it 's an infinitesimal minority of extremists who wear burqas . 
  edit source , it was actually 367 : http://tempsreel.nouvelobs.com/societe/20090729.obs5866/seules-367-femmes-porteraient-la-burqa-en-france.html, 
  huh ? 
  well , even before being elected , fran\u00e7ois hollande ( who 's of course a socialist ) , has always said [ he would maintain the burqa ban ] ( http://www.lemonde.fr/election-presidentielle-2012/breve/2012/04/27/hollande-maintiendra-la-loi-sur-la-burqa-s-il-est-elu_1692119_1471069.html ) , and he voted in favor of it ... 
  it does n't seem to be considered a particularly right-wing thing here . 
  in any case it only concerns a few hundred people , it 's not like it 's a law that matters on the grand scheme of things . 
  as for the police being not being able to carry guns , it seems to be very specific to the uk . 
  is there any other country that does this ? 
   mainstream french attitudes towards immigration would be considered right wing in britain . 
  < citation needed   fn has followed the same policy trajectory as the bnp , from imposed to voluntary deportation , but the former gets 20 % of the vote , whereas the latter get less than 5 % . 
  yes but they rarely ever get elected , they have very few representatives . 
  i 'm talking about the government here , not about the opinion of the general population . 
   you could say the same about a blunt attitude towards cultural assimilation < citation needed  ( and something other than the british media , since it usually specializes in french bashing )  also , arguably , french regionalist policy is still quite nationalistic , for instance the continued isolation of nantes from the bretagne region . 
  god knows what people would say if britain was maintaining that edinburgh was part of north east england . 
  erm , seriously ? 
  i 've never heard anyone in france complain about this , i doubt anyone cares whether nantes falls into one region or another on a map . 
   britain is certainly more capitalist , though . 
  i 've never thought that ` right wing ' was a very useful term . 
  it 's not really descriptive of a policy position , more an amorphous way of articulating dislike . 
  on reddit , maybe , but i was n't using this term in a negative way at all . 
  on the contrary , i think france should be more right-wing economically speaking , the uk is doing it right for a lot of things . 
  heh , there sure are a lot of people who vote for extremist right-wing parties , but the two-round system makes sure fn representatives rarely get elected . 
  note that i was just saying that our government in general is n't very right-wing compared to the uk 's - i 'm not saying that there are n't a lot of right-wingers in the population . 
  oh , i do n't think anyone here thinks people do n't work on sunday because they go to church or anything like that :-) i doubt you 'd find a lot of french people who still go to church on sunday , and the few ones who do are probably retired . 
  the fact that the official day off is a sunday of course has historical religious reasons , but it only made sense a long time ago . 
   lots more stuff shuts on a sunday is n't that left wing ? 
  the socialists are the ones who always defend this idea that shops should be forced to close on sundays here , the idea being that on average people wo n't buy more stuff if shops are open on sundays , but that people working in shops will work more , so it 's bad for workers ( more hours worked for the same revenue ) ... 
  the other argument being that they want to protect small shops who do n't have enough workers to open on sundays ( whereas big supermakets can do it easily ) . 
  in both cases it 's usually something the left wing wants to do . 
  sarkozy wanted more shops to be able to open on sundays and the socialists kept bashing him for that . 
  i do n't know , at least here , the uk is often seen as being highly pro-capitalism , with the city in london and its bankers , the fact that a lot of your universities are n't subsidized by the state and are highly expensive like in the us ( whereas here the tuition for a year of university is usually between 200 and 400 euro ) . 
  not to mention that the minimum wage in france is much higher , and that workers are way more protected in general ( which is n't a good thing imo , our job market is way less flexible , but that 's what left-wing politics are about ) , the amount of taxes is much higher in france , we have way more state workers ... 
  i 'd be interested in what makes you think france has been more right-wing than the uk ? 
  we 've had a lot of right-wing presidents but left-wing and right-wing do n't mean the same thing in different countries ( for instance , even when the us ` left-wing ' is in power , there 's still no free healthcare and the universities are still very expensive ) . 
  on average , i 'd say france has been way more left-wing than the uk . 
  erm , france , religious ? 
  i ca n't recall the last time i 've met someone who was religious here , except for a few muslims . 
  and at least here , the uk is always seen as being very bent on capitalism , i 'm surprised you 'd think the uk is more liberal than france , i do n't see how . 
  yes , but probably less so than the us and the rest of europe ? 
  the uk seems to be more right-wing than a lot of european countries . 
  full study here : http://trends.gmfus.org/survey-obamas-popularity-drops-in-europe-view-of-transatlantic-relationship-remains-stable/, 
  casse-toi = beat it, 
  a lot of french redditors are very left-wing ( pro-m\u00e9lenchon , etc. 
  ) , from what i 've seen . 
  not all of us are . 
  because it 's much harder for a small country like france to track french citizens abroad and to get them to pay . 
  you have the whole french riviera all around you though ... 
  it 's not like there are borders or anything . 
  the nice c\u00f4te d'azur airport is pretty close ( ~ 25 minutes away by car ) . 
  england is way more densely populated than france . 
  to be fair , flanders is way more densely populated than wallonia . 
  well england is quite densely populated . 
   i thought the uk would have been somewhere above germany , iceland and sweden ... seriously ? 
  this : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/brioche it 's some sort of sweet bread . 
  brioche is n't cake : <, 
   i believe he meant something like `` shame you have no way to feel the difference between standard language and dialect in france '' , not defending the idea that marseille french is a dialect .

  once i ordered a rug and the guy just left it in front of my building in paris . 
  i was n't told , but just happened to look at the thing when i got home from work and i understood it was my order . 
  very lucky no one took it . 
  haha , nice, 
  in french culture , due to our historical heritage surely , it 's considered rude and in bad taste to show or ask someone else some things which we consider should be private affairs : that includes religion , but also political opinion , or salary . 
  about religion , back in the day the catholic church held overwhelming power and influence . 
  when we turned secular we decided to limit ostentatious signs of religious affiliation from public service employees , considering that the state was secular , and the population diverse religiously ( at the time just catholic , jewish , atheist and protestant , really ) , their tax money should n't go to public servants who may use their power to promote their religion to those they 're supposed to serve . 
  this is largely accepted by all , until muslims arrived in important numbers and since they 're originally from countries which do n't practice this sort of discreetness , they 're having a hard time adapting to it . 
  i say `` when in rome ... '', 
  nuns wear the equivalent of a hijab , and both are allowed to be worn on public streets , and there are no nuns in the public service as far as i know . 
  so there 's no hypocrisy here . 
  it 's the same thing . 
  also , nuns have a male conterpart , monks , who also wear heavy cloaks , including on occasion a hood . 
  but anyway , i do n't think it 's a rare occurance to denounce sexism in the catholic church . 
  it 's pretty common . 
  it depends on your perspective , and you pretty much described a long fought sociological or moral debate we 've been having . 
  in france , the general idea is that veils are a sign of oppression of women , and/or ostentatious religious attire . 
  hence no face-veils in public streets ( too sexist ) , and no ostentatious religious symbols for public servants ( not secular ) . 
  the other side of the argument is indeed that `` people should wear what they please '' . 
  i happen to agree with french secularism though , as i find a satisfying logic to it . 
  but i hear and understand the criticisms of it , and i feel the difference of opinion is mostly a matter of personal morality and perspective , so i can lay out my defense for the french reasoning , but people simply wo n't necessarily agree with the method regardless . 
  some `` liberal '' muslim majority countries , like albania and kosovo are , tend to sway towards secularism ( turkey was/is like that as well ) . 
  not to mention that hijabs are foreign garments for them , associated to hard-line middle eastern islam , which can shock their culture as much as it can shock traditionally non-muslim countries like france and whatnot . 
  you 'd have good food . 
  we 'd have good music . 
  a fair trade if you ask me , 
  [ here 's ] ( http://www.ina.fr/video/i00012031 ) the video . 
  kohl and french president mitterand are at the battle of verdun memorial . 
  this moment was one of the strong , albeit latest , moments of franco-german reconciliation . 
  the glorious [ deep forests of france !, 
  true . 
  especially that i 'd wager that italian/french/spanish wine holds more prestige in japan , than sake does in these countries . 
  japanese cars , however , have a huge market here . 
  `` brown shirts '' is a pretty commonly used phrase all around in many languages , to call out fascists or nazis , and normally it 's a direct reference to the sa , aka the og nazis in germany before the purge . 
  the sa were street thugs and they essentially brought the nazis to power initially . 
  also a brown shirt is unconventional , which is why we prefer referring to the `` brown shirts '' rather than the `` black shirts '' of the ss . 
  `` brown shirts '' ca n't be mistaken with anything else but the nazis , so it 's an easier reference . 
  never heard it as a reference to historical collaborators . 
  were dutch collaborators in brown shirts ? 
  meh , the terrorist threat is the least of my worries however . 
  i feel not one tiny bit worried about terrorism simply because i rationally believe that the chances terrorism affects me or those close to me is tiny in a city of 2 million , even if we do have an attack every six months . 
  and i work in a touristic area . 
   if you consider paris is going worse and worse on the crime side i feel paris is very safe for such a large city . 
  i 've lived there most of my life and never had serious problems beyond the occasional street thugs looking for trouble at night when i was in my teens or early twenties , and these cases are usually solved by just walking away . 
  oh god , these pop up everywhere . 
  all in construction buildings seem to look like that . 
  i do n't think they 're ugly per se , but they look like budget hotels . 
  i do n't know . 
  i went to this particular library ( biblioth\u00e8que sainte genevi\u00e8ve ) plenty of times when i was a student , and i did n't feel bothered by noise . 
  what resonates may be the turning of paper , the cracking of the floor boards and whatnot , but that 's like neutral background noise . 
  does n't phase me at all . 
  what 's funny is that in french we pronounce the `` ball '' in `` football '' and `` handball '' differently , because it depends on the country/language we got this sport from ( respectively britain and germany ) . 
  we pronounce the `` ball '' with the gross approximation of how they 're pronounced in british english and german . 
  `` footbol '' , and `` handbaal '', 
  i 'd just like to bounce on this and tell our british friends that i love you guys . 
  brexit , and terrorism and whatnot , we remain bros through all of this . 
  right , actually what i said is n't so true about ancient history . 
  i was mostly thinking about post-industrial migrations . 
  but if we 're going back to medieval or earlier times , yeah there were definitely migrations of peoples and the ethnic maps would be way different from today throughout europe . 
  the question is then , how legitimate are these claims of land ownership if we go way back ? 
  i 'm willing to admit that each situation is unique and i do n't know much about the magyar situation . 
  if the countryside was romanian , and the cities were n't , is n't that proof that the land was originally romanian ? 
  i mean typically the demographics of cities , especially after the industrial revolution , is quite artificial . 
  the countryside is where you find the native population of a region , because no one migrates to become a farmer . 
  huh , i always assumed rich countries had higher suicide rates . 
  i mean that 's what i always heard . 
  something about how when you 're not precarious about food or money , you 're more easily driven to suicide by an unsatisfactory social or professional life . 
  i see i was completely mistaken here . 
  i once found an abandoned box of 1 to 5 cent coins . 
  they amounted to 30 euros approximately . 
  each time i 'd go to the supermarket , i 'd take a handful of these coins and dump them in the change-counter of the self-check-out machines . 
  got rid of them very fast . 
  anyway yeah , if this is such a problem i do n't understand why governments do n't have change machines here and there to encourage these coins to be reintroduced into the economy ( you throw in your small change and the machine gives you back large change ) . 
  hell , the state could even tax a small percentage and people would still use the machines . 
  where 's the k\u00e4rcher power wash when you need one, 
  what am i missing ? 
  france 's results seem pretty normal to me . 
  italy has an even broader distance between regions no ? 
  seems that for a country the size of france , and with such regional , and environmental diversity ( normans are nothing like basques for example , culturally ) , it 's unsurprising . 
  i have a hard time thinking of an execution method which would be more effective in terms of painlessness and swiftness . 
  well , perhaps those air guns used for slaughtering cows , or innocent bystanders in `` no country for old men '' ... 
  the only bad part of the guillotine is the humiliating and admittedly terrifying process of putting your head into that sort of contraption . 
  a firing squad , or even an electric chair , just seem less degrading . 
  that 's why the guillotine has a bad rap . 
  because it * looks * fucking terrifying . 
  former student in prehistory here . 
  there are definitely prehistorical sites in doggerland , under the north sea . 
  we 've found a bunch already , however mostly near the current coast . 
  but know that there are prehistoric sites and habitats all over the place and most have n't been found of course . 
  i mean human and prehuman prehistory in europe is at least 500,000 years old , and every tribe of prehistoric humans was nomadic or semi-nomadic for all that time , so each tribe built multiple campsites every year , every generation , for hundreds of thousands of years . 
  if you know where and how to look , any layman can find prehistoric stone tools lifted out from the ground after farmers ' machines turned the soil . 
  admittedly , most people ca n't recognise a human-made stone tool from a natural flint flake . 
  but if you know the basics it 's pretty clear when flint was touched by prehistoric human artisans . 
  point is though , yeah , many sites are burried in doggerland , but ultimately , we still have a lot to work with in the land we have left , and i do n't think the extra countless prehistoric sites in doggerland would revolutionize our understanding of human prehistory . 
  though chances are there are very cool and unique things to be found there too . 
  explain `` la promenade des anglais '' in nice :p, 
  dat northern european plain just got massively larger . 
  time to invade russia , and this time britain can come . 
  do n't bother . 
  we got involved in a war we did n't want , to respect an agreement which was completely one-sided on poland 's favor , who 's government was n't exactly likable at the time , notably in how they profited from the nazi invasion of czechia , and they 'll eternally berate us for being unprepared for their war .

  that should only happen to consenting adults at best . 
  not a dane but i 'd certainly welcome such a ban . 
   because the other comment was deleted , it was n't deleted by me , automoderate blocked me because of keywords , i asked moderators to reinstate it . 
   all fucking terrorists from recent attacks in paris and brussels held european citizenship ( newsflash , not portuguese ) . 
  yet none of them obviously passed by the airport . 
   you 're an even bigger moron than i thought . 
  i 'm not sure insulting people is going to get people to come to your side . 
  but hey sure you can keep ranting about how france is litterally hitler for it 's supposed 3 % deficit , for all the good it 's going to make you  and you send me an article talking about 10 guys from spain and portugal joining isis ? 
  whoa , big news . 
  no , i 'm not talking about that . 
  i was talking about how they used those connections to make a route in your country to pass their buddies . 
  http://www.gatestoneinstitute.org/4697/portugal-jihadists since they realized gibraltar was controled they followed the coast to portugal  this shows me how fucking ignorant that 's not an argument . 
  right . 
  please tell me how the glorious portugese army went to deal with all the islamists that use your country as a proxy to pass from morroco . 
  oh wait , it did n't because the english and us did it for you . 
  because we spend 5 % of our budget on our military while you do n't even have one . 
  and that 's not the only things . 
  your highways are built on eu [ french ] money too . 
  but hey fuck us for having a deficit am i right ? 
   what about if you are a small country that in 2010 had  10 % deficit france is nowhere near that . 
  we 'd get berated & punished if we had a 10 % deficit without a very very good justification . 
  plus , the fact that we increase spending on you is partly to allow you to diminush your own . 
  there 's also probably a good dash of corruption in that overspending you do ( maybe half of that 10 % ? ), 
  , which you could crack down on ( something still ongoing in france . 
  dassault/balkany / ... are due for trial ) without even affecting real spending ( ie money used to pay things for the country and not just ferraris for politicians ) . 
  ( of course things are n't as bad as in the uk on that plan so it 's not a daily popcorn scandal story like the brexit ), 
   france gets a free pass on this no , france get a `` pass '' because : - the deficit is in fact smaller than `` on paper '' . 
  accounting tricks ( negative rates borrowal ! ), 
  make it appear bigger ( 3 + % ) than it really is ( 1.8-2 % ? ), 
  - and we 're in deficit because we 're spending more than our `` fair share '' , notably paying bills for other countries that ca n't like , case in point , spain or portugal or greece , and funding some big important euro budgets - and we 're fielding/paying for policy and defense needs that a lot of countries outright refuse to pay for and where they blatantly cheat on their nato contributions . 
  in that present case , reducing blindly our spending could be very damageable for the eu as a whole . 
  say if we stopped paying soldier wages in eastern ukraine , the russians would just move in and at that point 0.1 % of saved deficit would look like pretty retarded . 
  similarly , if we stop paying for road maintenance in spain there 's a lot of roads that are going to be unusuable a couple years in and then good luck for trucking around your economy like the country currently do ... ( then france would sell less to spain too which would damage our economy in cascade etc etc ) so yeah i think it 's pretty hypocritic because countries love to cuts corners they should n't but when we cope for them , because , well , somebody has to , it 's `` french deficit and overspending !! \u00a7 \u00a7 !! '' . 
  so on a macro economic level we 're pretty obligated to maintain it somewhat as in currently ( and no we 're not going to make everything a complete classified black budget without reasons just to fit in spending rules , because that 's how you foster corruption . 
  so things get only re labeled ), 
   have no say in how the party goes . 
  that 's not true . 
  they could aim to steal the uk 's media space and thunder in bruxelles if they wanted ( with the uk doing it 's best to leave the eu , it 'd be easy for spain to take more place in convos instead ) . 
  tbh i 'm kindah assuming that spain likes to play it quiet and avoiding cameras for some reason , especially lately . 
  probably has to do with their different with catalonia . 
  that 's not necessarily a sign of weakness either ( some of the nordics , or , say , netherlands , are incredibly quiet too ) . 
  damn . 
  condoleances, 
   buying that equipment ( even if it produces some parts locally ) is n't going to help the standards of living of the brits . 
  actually it can : if it spare them of buying larger quantities of less usefull weapons sold 10x pricier for the same use they 'll save a lot of money . 
  apache are very versatile and something actually very usefull on a modern front like the uk is susceptible to face ( e.g : iraq , africa etc ) . 
  and honestly they 're selling at half price there, 
  i dunno whether it 's sexy on the landing strip , but i suspect a bit like the a10 it probably look like a flying miracle when it appear in the air for people getting shot at on the front, 
  50 for that price ? 
  46m a piece ? 
  this is ... very reasonable an export price for a decent weapon for once and probably what it 's worth once you include maintenance , spares , training etc ( maybe a few hundreds millions on top ) ? 
  was the defense contractor commercials drank under the table to sign that one while they usually x10 the price tag for the sake of profit ? 
  that is unusual for us defense export industry haha honestly , * if the numbers in that article are true * , that 's actually a pretty usefull weapon for quite a decent price and deal at first sight, 
  lol half the country hates him for having written another law just as harsh as the `` loi travail '' a year ago ( loi macron ) . 
  he 'd get nowhere . 
  probably as liked as romney or santorum in the usa . 
  absolutely deport rapists if they ca n't control themselves . 
  plenty of people can and those are the people i 'm happy to pay my taxes towards . 
  this is the kind of stupid thing that gives ammo to the afd amongst non-looney people +1 ; let 's deport condemned criminals . 
  hey thanks , 
  another proof the official relative numbers do n't prove anything , and they probably do n't even get close to reality with budget shufflings between defense and security agencies . 
  i mean , our country , france , probably spend on our military as much as all of eastern europe put together . 
  `` not their fair share '' riiiiiight . 
  please . 
  ~ ~ edit : people suggest france is actually at least around 2 and 2.2 % of the gdp without digging too far ~ ~ edit : the real enveloppe for military , security & peace spending all put together might or might not get close to 90b $ a year in reality ( but , while that seems a lot , admittedly , as compared to the us ' declared $ 600 + b and the trillions spent in iraq and other places ... ) edit which means we are spending 10-15 % ( or less ? ), 
  of what the americans probably spend ( in reality ? ), 
  lol, 
   the same reason france does n't want one . 
  lol we 're not against an eu army . 
  as a matter of fact we in fact founded the eurocorp and the first euro brigade with the germans : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eurocorps what we are against is abolishing our independant army right now while the rest of the eu is not yet integrated . 
  that allows us to keep protecting our interests ( e.g : mali ) without draging the entire eu in it . 
  but giving ressources to a second eu army on top of ours ? 
  no problem at all . 
  we might even transfert part of our defense ressources to it over time and focus our own force as a political intervention tool . 
   i think brexit is going to redefine british politics for decades to come is it ? 
  labor had moved full tory under blair ; and the non-cameron ( ie the [ murdoch/brexit friendly like farage ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2016/07/03/farage-murdoch-xlarge_trans++jdhzoku5ccgala2fvvreecqaql0ia9uido53pqqfgfs.jpg ) ) tories moving to the xenophobic right full steam ( http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/16/nigel-farage-defends-ukip-breaking-point-poster-queue-of-migrants ) . 
  so some people where bound to disagree with that at some point ( e.g : corbyn supporters in the labor ) and form new parties and movements ( momentum ? ), 
  assuming the political apparatus would allow them to register it and to officially oppose current government politics ( which during the iraq war was n't that obvious ) . 
  this is just the usual `` modern liberals '' vs `` old conservatives nationalists '' ( the original left/right ) reappearing 15 years later because both the tories & labor were full on conservative, 
   the uk 's proposed cut in the corporation tax '' * hey i have an idea , let 's collect even less taxes !, 
  after all a massive chunk of our budget is already missing and we live on eu subsidies in reality while cooking books to hide our debts . 
  so collecting even less tax money will obviously ... fix ... the budget deficit ... somehow ... * '' ( drunk tory economists arguing somewhere ? ), 
  edit : obviously , the comparison with france offering fiscal advantages to city companies to move in will crop up so let me explain why the comparison is likely wrong in my eyes : - in france case , the companies are n't yet there and do n't currently pay taxes in france . 
  if we hand over a ( say ) 10 % case by case fiscal advantage to specific big corps that moves in , it 's a net fiscal gain for the french country ( since current companies already there keep paying the same and new ones also pay taxes that they did n't paid in france before moving in ) . 
  - in the uk 's * current * case , companies are n't likely to move in at least for a year or two due to the ongoing brexit . 
  once that is settled ; tax cuts will have to be both large and applied to all companies since the intent would be to merely keep there companies already there . 
  and for somes that depend on eu fiscal passeports only , it wo n't suffice anyway . 
  so it 's at best a stop gap measure on a net loss causing another net loss . 
   it is speculated that he wants the support of the far-right voters in the upcoming election and continuously paints the activists in an extreme light . 
  is that an exageration or are you implying afd supporters are willfully trying to pick a fight ? 
  very interesting post . 
  i did n't understood what was going on , thank you . 
  so in a short few words , it 's a housing dispute ? 
   lost any respect i had for this man . 
  to go from the eu commission to a large bank , one of the many responsible for the 2008 crash is terrible but not completely surprising . 
  actually , for once , i see it as the bank at least half listening to bruxelles and trying to get advice on the eu 's / bruxelles ' opinion so i wo n't complain for my part  one of the many responsible for the 2008 crash is terrible that much is true , but it 's probably better to have eyes fixed on the futur and trying to prevent it from happening ( again ) . 
  if bruxelles can have a man on the inside , that might be good for the eu down the line . 
  cooperation can sometime be usefull, 
   this is to be changed , which may prompt accusations that standards are being lowered that 's the bit causing problem i suspect ( maybe they should n't lower standards for the same positions , just allow them to run current tests ? ) . 
  people have to be able to pull the same weight and hardships to fit the same roles,

  i was way too young and too foreign to actually know anything about pmqs and much about uk politics . 
  plus , i was in scotland , which is mostly labour . 
  one of my first encounters with hague was [ this poster ] ( http://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/o155820/be-afraid-be-very-afraid-poster-centurion-press/ ) , which never fails to make me chuckle , it 's such a cheap shot . 
  i 'm gon na be the one to go out and say it , and i do n't know how that 's going to be received , but i find bulgarian women on average really beautiful . 
  but then again i 'm particularly sensitive to eastern european charm , so ... :p otherwise , any country that takes its name from a steppe nomad tribe that once formed an empire actually called a ** khanate ** is badass in my book . 
  one could n't take a `` french khanate '' seriously , y' know ? 
  i 'll get to explaining : in the earlier years of the fifth republic , it was possible for the president ( elected by the people ) and the prime minister ( nominated by the president , usually following the dominant party in parliament ) to be from opposing sides . 
  it 's still theoretically possible now , but much less likely to happen . 
  mitterrand and chirac were in this situation , with chirac as mitterrand 's pm in 1988 , when they were the two candidates left for the presidential election of that year . 
  the two were famously antagonistic , primarily because mitterrand was an egotistical asshole . 
  during the presidential debate , chirac was desperate to level the playing field , as mitterrand 's position as president gave him an increased prestige and respect over chirac , who needed to appear similarly respectable . 
  so at the start of the debate , chirac said something to the effect of `` i know we have worked together in different settings , and i have always addressed you as `` mr. president '' . 
  today , we are not president and prime minister , we are two candidates on an equal footing , reaching out to the french people equally . 
  in this situation , i hope you will not take it as an offence if i simply call you mr. 
  mitterrand looked at him with a smile and responded `` you 're absolutely right , * mr. prime minister * . '', 
  and that was it . 
  mitterrand completely knocked over chirac 's effort to level the playing field , reminding everyone watching that `` screw you , remember that outside of this room , ** you work for me ** . 
  do n't go thinking we 're equals '' . 
  years later , a reporter was interviewing a former member of chirac 's staff who said that when mitterrand said his phrase , the chirac aides backstage all dropped and stopped watching , going `` welp , that 's it , mitterrand won the election . '', 
  mitterrand did end up winning . 
  chirac did n't become president until 1995 , after mitterrand had retired from politics . 
  reminds me of king juan carlos ' '' \u00bf por qu\u00e9 no te callas ? '', 
  to chavez . 
  also went memetic , too !, 
  hah , nice turnaround !, 
  my favorite putdown by an american politician is n't that funny . 
  it 's ron paul , in the 2012 primaries , absolutely destroying newt gingrich with `` when i was called , i was married and had two kids * and i went * '' on the subject of the draft . 
  not funny , but destroyed his argument in less that 'd ten words and ripped his balls out through his asshole . 
  powerful stuff . 
  holy . 
  shit . 
  i do n't know who came out of this more destroyed - blair , brown or the eu ? 
  i lived in the uk toward the end of the blair years , and i remember hague as a boring , humorless guy who did n't even have enough charisma to hold the tories in line . 
  i will revise that judgement . 
  also the time when he said of professional betrayer ( and later president ) sarkozy `` i need to stomp on this guy . 
  and with my left foot , it 'll bring me luck '' ( an old superstition in france is that stepping in shit brings good luck , but only if it 's with your left foot ), 
  i expected to find him in there , especially for the `` ugly/sober '' joke . 
  but i did n't know that one :  a sheep in sheep 's clothing it works on at least two levels , and it 's really subtle , you almost expect it to be a mistake at first ... that man was good . 
  in france , only two come to mind . 
  the first was from georges cl\u00e9menceau , a prime minister of the third republic at the time when the pm was the leader of the country . 
  cl\u00e9menceau was commenting on the scandalous death of president f\u00e9lix faure , in 1899 . 
  f\u00e9lix faure died of a heart attack while - or right after - having sex with his mistress , a married woman , right in the presidential palace . 
  literally `` he wanted to be caesar , and he died pompey '' . 
  the pun being that `` pomp\u00e9e '' can also be heard as `` pomp\u00e9 '' , which in this case means `` sucked '' . 
  so , `` he died sucked '' ... get the reference ? 
  everybody at the time sure did . 
  as for straight-up insults , i 'm mostly thinking of jacques chirac , president of france from 1995 to 2007 . 
  the quote comes from 1988 , at the time when he was only prime minister , while negotiating with margaret thatcher in a eu summit . 
  maggie was - as was her wont - insisting for heavy rebates and advantages for the uk . 
  literally , `` what else does that hag want , my balls on a plate ? '', 
  ... yeah , chirac was known to be classy . 
  oh , and his mic was on at the time . 
  in brittany , which retained a lot more celtic traditions than the rest of france , a farfadet is also called a [ korrigan ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/korrigan ) . 
  sometimes the name is also used to refer to water-spirits , similar to the british kelpies . 
  the tarasque myth is also interesting because it was intertwined with christian legend - the tarasque itself is quite probably a pre-christian myth , but it is described as being defeated once and for all by st. martha during the christianization of provence . 
  medieval france , especially in the central hills and highlands , in the alps and the south , had a lot of rampagning wolf packs . 
  a lot of folklore from the middle-ages concerns wolves . 
  on top of the beast of g\u00e9vaudan that / u/mnyx mentioned , you have the `` meneur de loups '' , ( literally `` wolf leaders '' ) , wizards that are supposed to speak the language of wolves and lead packs to attack humans . 
  but the most interesting legend is the voirloup , which is a bit like a werewolf : voirloups are sinners who have sold their souls to satan and undergo satanic ceremonies where they use a mixture made of sperm and blood to turn into wolves , or sometimes foxes , boars , and other animals . 
  they 're immortal , invincible , they can only be chased away and never killed . 
  they control fire and love to set barns and field aflame . 
  they do n't kill their victims , but instead drink their blood like a vampire . 
  they also have the ability to know when someone talks or writes about them , and they love to attack those who do once night falls . 
  agreed , but unfortunately , most of them are citizens of the countries they 're in , so it 's extremely tough to put together efficient measures without reneging on our democratic principles . 
  deportation - to where ? 
  death penalty - that 's barbaric . 
  prison - to what end ? 
  rehabilitation - is it even possible ? 
  knowing your politics , you 're probably familiar with the lenin quote `` the capitalists will sell us the rope with which we will hang them '' . 
  i sometimes feel like western democracies handed the extremists the fuse with which they 'll blow themselves - and us - to bits ... 
  yes and no . 
  p\u00e9tain was indeed originally sentenced to death and had his death penalty commuted to life in prison , but there was more than one justification . 
  he was the hero of verdun , which merited some consideration , but charles de gaulle , when talking about his decision , famously said * `` la vieillesse est un naufrage '' * ( old age is a shipwreck ) . 
  meaning `` he did n't know what he was doing , he thought he was doing what was best , he was just an old fart with good intentions and terrible ideas '' . 
  i wonder what went through the graphic design guys ' heads when they got that phonecall . 
   government : `` we want your company to redesign all the banknotes that will be used in norway for the coming twenty years ''  graphic guy : * ^ ass ^ clenches *, 
  dude , do n't . 
  russians and jet planes , especially over ukraine , do n't mix well . 
  oh man , if i knew the flemings would give me gold for ripping on them , i 'd have started a long time ago !, 
  thanks man :d, 
  rarely , actually . 
  i ally france as soon as they get out of the hundred year 's war , because they usually rival castile when they can . 
  so we get a good relationship boost out of the common hatred of castile , and they 're pretty lenient on the border disputes . 
  then , if i get to absorb castile , i break my alliance with france immediately and ally austria/the netherlands/whatever holy roman empire power is at its peak right now , and count on them to balance out france . 
  wow , and i thought i 'd seen everything when i saw greeks and turks get into youtube flamewars over istanbul vs. constantinople ... 
  besides , we did n't * romanize * the walloons ... we * civilized * them . 
  you should be angry at us , but just because we did n't get far enough to the north and bring the gift to you . 
  when wwiii breaks out , we 'll make sure to have some sort of arm\u00e9e de terre ~ ~ division ~ ~ ~ ~ regiment ~ ~ ~ ~ platoon ~ ~ squad come along and protectoratize you . 
  we 'll make up for our neglect , promise !, 
  ... ew , do we have to ? 
  i 've seen what they get up to in their porn !, 
  taking a province in west africa , maybe in morocco or something , is a good spring board if you want to expand into ivory coast , congo and wherever else once you get colonists , since it 'll augment your colony range . 
  i did that as tuscany , and it worked out . 
  otherwise , stay out of africa until your european bases are solid and you do n't have threats at your back , because you 'll be putting down revolts and fighting muslim alliances for a long time .

  there is absolutely no fucking way i 'm going to sleep now . 
  this is just getting surreal . 
  i can barely believe it . 
  clinton badly need michigan and pennsylvania , or she 's over . 
  and she 's behind in michigan . 
  he is . 
  there it is . 
  he 's got florida . 
  show me ? 
  he just won ohio . 
  wow , good luck to you . 
  i used to work in a factory , we were off to work at 5 : /, 
  work ? 
  is portugal that far to the west ? 
  now nyt is saying 73 % . 
  looks like he is n't losing florida after all . 
  just kidding i ca n't sleep the rollercoaster : http://imgur.com/a/pmmme, 
  ok friends , that 's enough , i 'm going to bed now . 
  let 's hope we 'll pay as much attention fr the new european parliament election . 
  6 hours `` is new york burning ? '', 
  it 's still very early to say . 
  however if trump does n't win , at least he 'll lose honorably . 
  i know this feeling ... is it brexit all over again ? . . 
  it 's really beautiful . 
  i would n't mind switching the marseillaise for this one someday . 
  * [ charms in french ] *, 
  in the entire eu , actually !, 
  though france and italy , which are the most interested in protecting their foodstuff , have been the main proponents and defenders of these principles . 
  i ca n't agree with you there . 
  eu law is an effective protection against counterfeit goods . 
  it is vital for french farmers , for example , that protected wine & cheese keep being protected from cheap knock-offs made in the us or elsewhere and bearing the brand name . 
  people have been pushing for it , at least for politicians running for office . 
  i think all of our government 's members have to publish this kind of information now , same for members of parliament . 
  germany , good friends . 
  we look up to you . 
  uk , let 's keep the banter rolling , even though you 're not making it easy these days :'( ( or are you ? ... ), 
  spain , er ... you have nice beaches . 
  thank you for that . 
  italy ... you have nice pasta . 
  thank you for that as well . 
  belgium , same as uk , but you 're definitely making the banter easier  luxembourg , no compliment for you . 
  gib tax monies back . 
  pls . 
  i am neutral toward suisse . 
  and andorra , if i knew anything about you , i 'm sure it would be super positive . 
  yeah !, 
  well europe would be a better place without cheap alcohol sold without control on the streets ... not sure if that 's a big thing , but it would n't hurt if it was n't ... 
  good lord . 
  enough of this stupid story already . 
   serbia : /  germany ? 
  i am concerned by the role of my language in an international setting , not for personal reasons but rather because i 'm aware that this is n't a neutral thing . 
  language * does * play a role , and i do n't get why some are trying to dismiss it . 
  first it as an ideological component . 
  one thinks within a language , and concepts do n't necessarily translate into another ; by switching to your interlocutor 's mother tongue you are adopting the intellectual background of this tongue , while being limited in adopting yours . 
  then there is the fact that you are limited by the fact that you 're expressing yourself in a foreign language . 
  you lose efficiency , you 're limited in the set of words you get to use , you try to translate concepts in your mother tongue which do n't actually have an equivalent . 
  i do n't want to be limited in discussions/arguments/negociations , nor do i want our representatives to have the lower hand when they are defending our interests . 
  also you are a foreigner in a foreign tongue ; wherever they speak your language you 'll always be more likely to feel at home . 
  i would love the world to be as welcoming to me , on that perspective , and keeping in mind all the other cultural/etc disagreements , that it is to native english speakers sometimes . 
  finally i do n't want to * force * people to speak * my * language , which is actually * ours * . 
  i am convinced that making our language more attractive will make our culture easier to access , and making our culture easier to access make our language more attractive . 
  they go hand in hand there . 
  i do n't get why people take that for arrogance . 
  this is just basic cultural realpolitik . 
  i 'm not saying i want the whole world to speak french , but every initiative to promote its use in an official context is very welcome to me . 
  the fact that the brit media lost their shit over the simple idea that negociations could be lead in another tongue than theirs is very telling i think . 
   cheer magic :d though i would tend to agree to avoid using english * calques * when you have a perfectly fine french word that 's available to you . 
  scoop or brainstorming do n't really have an equivalent . 
  most people , french or not , do not care about politics . 
  this is the reason why they do n't care about the status of a language in international discussion . 
  the fact that common people do n't care does n't mean the issue is n't relevant . 
   this very post is an epitome of that : barnier did not even ask for french to be the language of negotiation , and see how the medias are portraying this non-event ? 
  an entirely fabricated thing , out of thin-air , perfect to portray him as an anti-british prick that will be dishonest in his dealings and his diplomacy ; this will have very real consequences as far a public opinion goes . 
  you can always debunk that kind of thing , as he tried to do , but no one is interested in the debunking , they all want to hear the juicy scandal about smelly frenchies getting their panties twisted and not being able to do anything about it because `` hey , it 's the xxist century , wake up , you 've lost your cultural supremacy and you should forget about it !! '' . 
  building the straw man , perfect incarnation of the already latent prejudice , answering the call for a revenge fantasy about those pompous pricks that think they are better than everyone 100 % agreed . 
  though i do n't share your opinion that it 's a lost cause , or that it does n't actually matters . 
  maybe you do n't care , but i certainly do , and i 'm far from being alone in that case . 
  why are you trying to glorify the fact that you do n't care about an issue anyway ? 
  interesting case . 
  i am far from being a specialist in eu law and case law , we 'll have to see if there 's an appeal and if the decision has any effect on the daily recruitment practices . 
  from what i see the core issue revolves around proving that knowing english , french or german is an essential asset , which seems definitely doable . 
  regarding the backlash ... yeah , absolutely . 
  this is the reason why i do n't think it would happen anytime soon , and the reason why i think we 'll have more strong-arming on language issues in the years to come rather than a legal solution . 
  too bad , but that 's one of the many issues the ( too ) quick expansion of the eu has brought to us . 
  as of 2006 72 % of the drafts from the eu texts were in english v. 14 % in french and 14 % others , so you may not be too far off , but 95 % seems a bit much . 
  ( you can go check here http://online.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/abs/10.3828/ejlp.2010.2 ), 
  the opinion i have formed is that we should have a trio of official languages : english , french , german ( which are currently working languages ) . 
  it would be a good middle spot between the all-english communication we 're on our way to have , but that 's against the principles of multiculturalism of the eu , and the current situation of having 24 official languages , which is actually leading us * toward * more english . 
  well , i have yo say that 's an excellent short presentation of the french labour market . 
  i think that 's the first time i 've seen an anglophone paper be that accurate . 
  english language news sources in countries where english is n't commonly spoken ? 
  well , good luck with that . 
  sorry to break it to you , but if you wan na change your perspective on anything through foreign news you 'll have to learn another language , there really is n't any good way around it . 
  otherwise try reuters or agence france presse . 
  oh , come on . 
  he * is * a moderate . 
  the definition of pop 's center right . 
  oh , absolutely . 
  i am just explaining why this european sub is more like a uk sub , like they mentioned . 
  the silent majority does n't vote !,

  whatever works , as long as nobody is hurt and no sensible laws are broken . 
  transit country or not there wered million unregistered permanent/semi-permanent migrants in the country before the crisis . 
  the money to pay for the refugees in greece is quite low , while austria 's state is not dire . 
  as foe your later paragraph , i ca n't agree more . 
   id question your reading comprehension in that case . 
  it 's not necessarily my comprehznsion that 's at fault . 
  the wording itself does not help . 
  besides , he has n't responded to my original comment to disprove what i said , thus what you understood from his post is as much debatable as what i understood . 
   he does n't think that 's a good thing . 
  his use of hyperbole is not very helpful as an an argument then because it shifts the attention from thz actual aegument to the sanders-mao debate . 
  from what i recall w ` he compared the death toll , but right now i ca n't check . 
  you also say hooked , but is there any high profile candidate who 's not hooked a large amount of people ? 
  i thought it to be quite logical , guess not . 
  greek counter argument : '' we deal with this migration problem for the past 15-20 years and our economy 's in the shitter . 
  we also happen to never get any meaningful help except giving away total border sovereignty . 
  oh and frontex does n't work too well . '', 
   i 'm strongly in favour of quotas myself . 
  but in any case , there needs to be a better solution than `` no need for background checks , just let them through . 
  they 'll probably register legally in some other country '' . 
  i agree . 
   that 's a poor reason , simply because that 's a reason to fingerprint everyone - migrant or citizen alike . 
  i was fingerprinted when i got my passport or id , so it 's already the case , no ? 
  besides , migrants often , extremely often change their names to pass as somebody else and avoid capture . 
  if fingerprints were taken systematically then many would 've been in prison today , while some may be housed as assylum applicants/receivers . 
  they do n't track them per se , but if they are screened ( routine checks ) , you know who they . 
  so the point is to relieve countries of a responsibility and dump it on a handful few , that also happen to be in an economic pickle ? 
   i 'm asking what 's the point on austria saving fingerprints in the first place ? 
  if a crime happens , we have a record . 
  if said person aplies for assylum somewhere , we already have his file and can act accordingly , plus it saves time , thus ressources . 
  we also can know where they go when they get screened , instead of being a new persob each time and thus know the numbers more accurately . 
  no , i 'm not speaking about quotas but about austria not registering the refugees / not sharing the data , which is what the border countries were accused of . 
  if you want to talk about something else then it 's your call , just do n't put words in my mouth . 
  my argument is that when the southern states do it it 's made a huge deal but wheb it 's austria or germany not so much . 
  it 's the application of double standards that gets me . 
  as for your second paragraph i do n't quite get it . 
  well the problem is that often the criminals of regimes are protected in order to have some form of reconciliation . 
  i 'm thinking of various war criminals in ww2 , francoist higher ups after his death and in african countries where various forces were left free if the surrendered arms , which may have turned in the continuation of the conflict/problems . 
  indeed , but we have to go beyond this . 
  we * must * . 
  why so ? 
  i think i see what you mean . 
  this `` trend '' you speak of however can be explained , or mostly i guess with the fact those countries fell apart economicaly and ultimately had to open up on `` western '' ideas . 
  in a similar way that with each regime change in chine , since the antiquity , the new regime demonised rhe previous , or put forth or the ills it provoked , removing the positive points . 
  it 's not as extreme but there is a slight reminiscence of that practice . 
  however i do think that the west/capitalists were less thorough / severe than if the communists `` won '' , perhaps because of the general and perhaps superficial freedom . 
  well the red guarillas in west block europe got pretty welle butt fucked , especially in greece and spain . 
  i think his comment shows quite plainly that he was comparing snder to mao , perhaps even equating them . 
  as another person said , his whole comment/argument was a strawman . 
  the extent of the first point is left to be seen . 
  not that i conclude it 's small or insigbifficant , it 's just not known , or not yet disclosed . 
  as for italy not registering people if they want to go to germany , germany itself and others do it . 
  he does n't say anything about two wrongs or whatever . 
  the guy he responds to had a brainfart comparing a moderate-ish politician to stalin while claiming the ills of the world only happened because of the left . 
  the guy you responded to simply gave the names of people who were on the same boat as stalin or mao but on the right side of the political spectrum , rendering the initial argument null , adding some sarcasm to ridicule it . 
  no , i believe that this thread had nothing to do with sander or american politics yet somehow somebody managed to bring up hardline leftist/communists with a huge death toll and equate them with sanders . 
  what next , talk about the klingon language ? 
  damn government , spiking our water with fluorinol !, 
  what did he mean though ? 
  is it an expression ? 
  citation needed . 
  i was present during registration of migrants/refugees and every care was being taken . 
  if they did what austria did that 's another thing which i ca n't know but considering austria let pass 700k people then they may as well have let pass as many as greece has . 
  while condemning greece and co for their nazi ways and whatever the fuck passes as quality political discourse today . 
  bringing up sanders like that and going on about socialism while only mentioning the extreme far left makes me wonder whether or not he 's from the usa . 
  edited a `` the '' to a `` he 's '' . 
  and then everybody points the finger to italy , greece and hungary ... 
  i think there 's a slight difference between sanders and mao/stalin . 
  besides , those examples you gave were all authoritarian states , sanders does n't seem to be so . 
  i see what you mean , perhaps however the big `` modernisation '' you expect is something that came before because the disparoty between the other countries/usa was too big , which may now not be that much the case . 
  old machinery does n't mean obsolete . 
  a manual lathe may be 100 years old and not need changing , ut 's repaired and the tools are renewed . 
  the swedes practice fraud with their housing problems , trying to circumvent the `` queue '' . 
  when the state does n't work , people try to do things their way , no matter the nationality . 
  you slit it 's throat or thrust your dagger to his heart or his head . 
  why slit the throat ? 
  easiest to do and it 's going to be done anyway during the skinning of the animal , while a hole in the sternum or head damages the hide . 
  in any case the two methods that are the most sure that i know of are the head and the heart . 
  quick and painless and the subject makes no sound . 
  a head shot may have a wider margin of error than a heart shot , however striking the heart is more difficult . 
  actually , there are cases of people surviving a partially cut throat , and there are many cases of complete slit artery etcthat continued to squirm and thrash for a while , more than a minute . 
  as for people being shot in the head , there are cases as you say , which are very specific . 
  a bullet in the middle between the hemispheres has a chance not to kill the person , a shot from the side many less . 
  a shot from the area of the mouth or the chin is absolutely lethal as long as not ligbed up with the hemispheres , and even then if it hit the lower parts the subject is brain dead . 
  by no means is it a crap shoot and in the least of cases , if we discount the very rare surviving situations , a brain dead subject us as good as an anesthetised one , thus you can allow more freedom there . 
  there is a lot of evidence disproving otherwise . 
  a bullet is a bit of both worlds , it provokes bleeding and destroys the brain , thus the chances of dying/not being concious are even greater . 
  edit : or a bolt , though it does n't expand as a hollow point round . 
  why , because we like eating meat but also want some basic decency , and the animal to suffer as little as possible ? 
  sure , other sections of the meat industry are also deplorable , but that 's not the case everywhere and you regularly have reports and uproar about an incident that may happen . 
  this religious practice is no different than the cases where the bolt broke and left the cattle to suffer because the farmer or company was too stingy . 
  if you want to continue doing halal and kosher , then the butchers must make it so the animal does n't suffer or is put out of its misery fast . 
  slice the throat , shoot the animal right after , or something of the sort . 
  if you believe that then you have not understood anything i wrote, 
  i never said the pkk was much better , however the shit they did is less nonsensical and more targeted than what palestinians do . 
  say , the pkk seems to be targeting the turkish state - usually - , while hamas and fatah and co are touching more civilians in the end . 
  the end is for the occupied parts to be given back , since they are internationally illegal . 
  if magically palestine becomes peaceful in the process , then it 's a lose win win scenario , but at worst it 's a scenario where israel has one less argument flung at it , thus probably less negativity from muslim countries . 
  not much i guess , but it 'd be a start, 
  sensible point , but i still see it as the application of two different standards where there should n't be any difference . 
  goods from crimea are embargoed .

  that is what makes a true leader . 
  as verhosfstadt said he has the most personal legitimacy of any prime minister in greece for a long time . 
  i also read a number of comments here ( in the excellent community ama ) that many oxi voters were saying no to the return of the old parties and attendant clientelism and corruption - if so , tsipras could win with a tough but serious program offering real hope . 
  but that is only the optismistic view of course , whether it is likely i ca n't tell . 
  germany is not isolated here , i am sure merkel approves of this . 
  could be - on the other hand having * one country * less disciplined and more adverse to reform than you within the eurozone made france look better  what i would hope , is that having helped the greeks design a true fiscally responsible reform program , they come back to france and replicate it here . 
  not sure . 
  syriza is many parties , tsipras now has the choice to ditch the crazies and reform greece , collaborating with europe , or follow them to their path of destruction . 
  this is certainly not about a transfer union , it is about greece taking responsibility and implementing a serious and credible program , which the french team can help them formulate and number-crunch - acting as consultants here . 
   i seriously hope france is taking their orders from germany on this case . 
  i very much doubt that , but if they can do something , it is help the greeks make a serious proposal that would be acceptable to germany . 
  bear in mind it is a technical team , not politicians . 
  excellent piece , this summarizes well the choice tsipras is facing - the choice verhofstadt expressed is such striking terms . 
  well , we have different alternative history scenarios on what might have been , it does n't matter much though , we 'll just see what comes next . 
  in my view , yes and no : had tsipras proposed a convincing reform and spending cut program , and put as the only condition a commitment to start restructuring talk , he would have had the support of france , italy , and the imf at least and i think a deal could get done ( in essence , what he can get now minus the drama , default , and capital controls ) . 
  the issue is he was n't offering that , instead red lines everywhere ( admittedly he may have been held hostage by his left wing ) . 
  anyway , water under the bridge ( costly as it may have been both to his country and to europe ) , we 'll see now what comes tonight . 
  i amnot entirely excluding a serious proposal , given the reports of gettimg a french technical team on board - for one thing they are very good , they know the eu ( they also know how to make pretend budget cuts and minimal reforms look good enough to brussels , but i hope that 's not what they were brought in for ) , and it does not make a lot of sense for tsipras to get them if he does not intend to do a deal and let his left wing split off or fold . 
  yes but price controls always have the same effects , and they are negative . 
  softer ones have less impact , that 's all . 
  but if you mean influence , then yes , they can : remove barriers if they exist ( e.g. 
  some countries have restrictive policies for large supermarkets - remove those and consumers have access to cheaper goods ) , get eu to cancel remaining barriers to import of cheap goods where they exist , etc , lower costs of doing business any way you can - competition will do the rest . 
  today we can all buy incredibly cheap clothes for instance , thanks to lowering import barriers . 
  you said `` past deals '' so i assumed you meant ... `` past deals '' : ) but yes as to the proposals made during the last negociations they did not include debt restructuring . 
   there was no form of debt restructuring , this is simply not true . 
  there was substantial debt restructuring including large haircuts , grace periods , maturity extensions , and interest reductions . 
  that it was insufficient as a permanent solution is true , but you can not say there was none . 
  and it did bring down interest costs to sustainable levels . 
  bear in mind that state control of prices do more harm than good as they produce shortages . 
  this is not a way to raise standards of living at all . 
  if done while staying in an open market like the eu , the result would be that subsidized stuff would be reexported for profit to neighboring countries where it can be sold at market price . 
  you would of course see a black market develop , with market price stuff available to those with money and connections . 
  even better , 
  this was done already to a large extent , which is the reason why , despite the high amount of debt , its interest costs are low . 
  the sustainability discussion concerns principal repayment mainly . 
  but yes , when there 's talk of relief or restructuring , it means primarily things like extending maturities and grace periods again , cutting the rate etc. 
  it is in fact huge , and the title is a deliberate distortion . 
  the article makes sensible points one may or may not agree with , but includes nothing remotely close to that title . 
  personally i would not object to a `` muslim democrat '' party any more than to a `` christian democrat '' one , though i would vote for neither . 
  i really do n't think that 's on the cards , surely not in the short term . 
  parallel currency / ious and a de facto partial suspension of ez membership , yes - but eu exit ? 
  there is no reason for that , no benefit either , and no one wants it . 
  it 's more about hollande than about the government , the prime minister has much higher approval ratings . 
  they must have printed something , at the very least as contingency planning . 
  even if they put forward a proposal they can hardly be sure of it being accepted now by both lenders and their parliament . 
  they just need enough notes to distribute with a low limit at first , most of the ious or drachmas will be electronic anyway . 
  they may perhaps even have just used their euro printing press , stamping `` iou '' or something on the notes in a way that invalidates them as euros . 
  how many could they print in 10 days ? 
  would n't that be enough to feed the atms ? 
  maybe . 
  she is very articulate , not one to mince words , and if she wanted to say that she would say it directly and not in passing speaking to some us think tank . 
  also she is certainly not a mouthpiece for the us administration . 
  the mere fact that debt restructuring is needed ( without saying when , how , and under which condition ) is agreed by the eurogroup too . 
  said today but hardly big news given that she 's been saying it consistenly for about the last three years . 
  i ca n't read the text but that picture is really good , 
  there will be inflation with a new currency , but if they do not make a proposal acceptable to the lenders it is the only option , as the banks will be cut off from ecb support . 
  they need to prepare for it - it may well be of questionnable legality but this is probably the least of their worry . 
  it would be best if they negociated a clean exit from the eurozone , but politically it does n't look like they can . 
  was the rehiring forced by a court decision ? 
  i admit i was n't aware of that . 
  giving money unconditionally is not a possibility , it would even be illegal under the european treaties . 
  if that is what you mean , the answer has been known for long : no . 
  oxi if you prefer . 
  talk is easy , i have n't seen their bailout offer though . 
   the syriza government proposed to employ massive numbers of new tax inspectors , but this was postponed because they ca n't afford it and troika insists on further cut and yet they had no qualms about rehiring 1500 previously laid off public sector workers instead . 
  sorry but the `` lenders prevented it '' excuse does n't fly . 
  loans to greece are not made with the expectation to be profitable , nor even repaid in full - if they were , they would get private sector funds easily . 
  they are made for political reasons , for preserving the union , etc. 
  indeed , `` bad sportsmanship '' is a very gentle way to describe it , assuming the article is factual . 
  if siemens had any real qualms over this they would have made them known earlier - presumably pipistrel would win if it sued siemens over this , but can they afford to ? 
  note that articles 12 to 16 of the esm treaty spell out the process , this is only the first step - a key condition to any assistance is the signing of an mou * ( `` the conditionality attached to the esm loans shall be contained in a macro-economic adjustment programme detailed in the mou , in accordance with article 13 ( 3 ) ) * , which is where the substance lies . 
  all i know is it 's complicated - when a treaty says how breaches are handled ( within the treaty in this case afaik ) , i do n't think international law can invent remedies outside the treaty . 
  suits and countersuits are always possible , but i do n't expect there is anything like a clear outcome . 
  i have no idea , really , maybe an expert in international law can answer . 
  i really doubt the eu would try illegal ( or borderline legal ) sanctions though , if only because of the experience of the austria case in 2000 . 
  i ca n't even tell if you 're sarcastic or if you really mean it . 
  agreed , this might come into play not from just grexit , but in some kind of `` going rogue '' scenarios like those mentionned in the crazy talk of some syriza hardliners . 
  it there is no agreement , everyone 's interest is still to keep greece in the eu unless the crazies seize power and start actively sabotaging the union . 
  i must say this is one area where it is impossible to agree . 
  i actually view the lenders previous proposals in this respect as too timid , but they are seen by others as tremendous austerity . 
  i expect that my country will soon take significantly more severe measures to balance its own pension system , without being forced to do it by any lenders or looming default . 
  this is true , but as you say it 's not expulsion but suspension ( still big ) , and also this relates only to breaches of article 2 - which was n't intended for such cases ar all , though the rule of law provision could perhaps be twisted into use . 
  and iirc there are steps to the process , the country can defend itself etc , it would not be a simple matter . 
  plus what you mention about unanimity ... 
  in addition i doubt very much that others would even * want * to go that route . 
  i see - wonder what the holder split is today . 
  still , holders might roll them over : if they do n't they know they may not get paid and this triggers default , if they do they have a chance that the agreement goes through . 
  and they could get a 50 % or higher yield to make it worth the risk too . 
  another possibility is that some governments ( france and germany maybe ) might discreetly put some backstop bids at the auction to ensure it does n't fail , using some semi-gov institutions as a front . 
  but we 'll know very soon , apparently the auction is tomorrow ( well , today now ) http://mobile.reuters.com/article/idusl8n0zj23n20150703?irpc=932 for clearing the imf arrears ( and paying the ecb on the 20th too ) they 'll use the bridge loan that will be part of the agreement if there is one . 
  edit : the bills were rolled over at auction today . 
   which will put it in contravention of the treaties and be forced out of the eu . 
  there is no provision for forcing a country out , breach or no breach . 
   b ) the eurogroup and imf just decide to prolong the discussions although we 've seen this scenario time and again , it does seem much less likely this time : a deal must be approved and executed before the 20th , and if sunday 's solemn all-eu summit ends in failure , what would they have left to discuss ( apart from some orderly eurozone exit and similar damage control ) ? 
  actually , if there is no agreed plan before , that summit is set to discuss plan b , and i expect that 's what they would do . 
  no no , the secret love story is between lagarde and varoufakis , 
  this is a debatable point , although the pro-inflation camp is clearly dominant . 
  well no ideal solution exists for either party , not even good ones i 'm afraid - they 'll have to do with acceptably bad and spin it as satisfactory . 
  it 's more a matter of avoiding worse ones . 
   greece owes 2 billion to t-bill holders this friday .

  continuing the slow descent into the abyss ? 
  i think you may not be fully aware of marine le pen 's program . 
  disregarding her stance on immigration , she wants to exit the eu , go back to the franc , and implement an extremely left-wing welfare system . 
  even if she could somehow save us from terrorism , she 'd ruin the economy ... 
  you 're being downvoted but i 'm surprised too . 
  not even * once * in 14 years ? 
  til ireland is * way * colder than france . 
  dude , it 's above 30 \u00b0 c all summer here in the french riviera and most people do n't have ac at home . 
  i think it 's similar in most of europe . 
  what is n't ? 
  [ this article from a few months ago is about the president of the french football federation ] ( http://www.liberation.fr/sports/2016/06/22/euro-2016-pour-le-graet-l-objectif-des-demi-finales-reste-le-meme_1461232 ) stating that our objective was to reach the semi-finals , for instance . 
  bah , being an adult is about being objective about your strengths and your weaknesses . 
  you can call that `` surrendering '' , i call that `` not being an idiot '' . 
  the objective was to reach the semi-finals , from the beginning , and it was an optimistic objective . 
  we ended up in the final . 
  i would n't really say we 're down on the ground , a few months ago nobody would have believed we had a chance to reach the final . 
  there was no such ad campaign . 
  '' i.e. 
  :  this issue is concerning , because the bolkenstein law makes it possible for a polish plumber or an architect from estonia to work in france with the same salary and welfare they would have in their home country . 
  which is hardly hatred towards poles ... not to mention he was talking about a hypothetical scenario in the future . 
  i do n't think anyone thinks france is overwhelmed by poles , you never meet any here . 
  no but it 's just ... 
  different . 
  i 've never heard people bashing poles in france for instance . 
  the only eastern european hate i see is about gypsies , but they are n't really white . 
  heh , if they can hate us less for a few days , that 's a good thing . 
  i 'm kinda surprised they hate poles in the uk . 
  i mean , they are n't even brown . 
  / r/soccer is so incredibly butthurt . 
  i do n't even care about football but it 's funny . 
  the thing is , france is full of sparsely populated countryside , which is what you see on most of this map . 
  immigrants do n't really live there . 
  they live in cities , but given the size of our d\u00e9partements , this is n't really visible on the map . 
  these people suck at writing urls . 
  yeah it would be pretty stupid to not at least try to attract finance jobs just because `` finance '' is `` your enemy '' . 
  this is empty rhetoric hollande used to attract uneducated voters , but he is ( fortunately ! ), 
  being pragmatic now . 
  although i 'm not really convinced these incentives will be efficient at all . 
  polls showed uk voters backed remain during the run up to the referendum ... 
   poor guy !, 
  i think he 's doing an okay job , and i voted for the other guy !, 
  are you me ? 
  he 's reforming the country more than sarkozy did , because people protest less against you if you 're ps . 
  so i think he 's doing pretty well !, 
  benelux, 
  i ca n't believe the eu is ruled by this guy and nobody 's in the streets protesting . 
  it is . 
  the only sane comment on this page , downvoted .

  yeah i do n't get it . 
  canada or australia are n't in the eu and they 're doing pretty well . 
  everybody on this sub is acting like this is the end of the uk , when there is no reason to believe so really . 
  in the winter , pure cold water can be freezing cold . 
  they were tourists who vacation with bombs in their backpacks . 
  still better than nothing ? 
  is n't the issue that she ca n't really rinse the dishes because they have separate taps over there for hot and cold water , so you ca n't get any water to flow at a decent temperature , and you 're forced to mix hot and cold water in the bowl , which makes rinsing things impossible ? 
  honestly , i 'm more offended by the fact that they have two separate taps for hot and cold water . 
  apparently , since you 're not able to get any water flowing at a decent temperature , you 're supposed to mix it in the bowl and wash you hands in that ... kinda disgusting . 
  it probably also explains why they do n't really rinse dishes though . 
  they have to use water in the bowl , if they do n't want to freeze or burn their hands . 
  crazy people . 
  pretty sure junker is one of us in / r/europe , trolling like crazy . 
  i do n't think it 's linked to that . 
  i 've never heard of people hating on poles in france . 
  it really is a uk-only thing in my experience . 
  my girlfriend is polish ( she lives in france ) and part of her family lives in the uk , apparently it 's a completely different experience for them compared to her . 
  this is probably because there are so many more poles in the uk than in other european countries ( they 're extremely rare here , other than my girlfriend i 've met maybe one in my life ) . 
  the commission president probably should n't have been managing a tax haven for years either . 
  and yet here we are . 
  honestly , i never get these complaints . 
  if these people do n't believe strongly enough in their opinion to go vote , maybe they are n't lazy . 
  maybe it just means that they are not sure enough of themselves , or do n't care enough about the subject , to decide voting is important . 
  so maybe it 's perfectly fair that they do n't go . 
  i 'm not sure forcing everybody to vote would lead to results that are more relevant . 
  it would probably push more people who lean slightly more to the left without having paid too much attention about politics or caring to vote , yes . 
  are those relevant votes , if they 're been obtained by forcing those people to make a choice ? 
  a few times in my life , i did n't vote , when i was younger . 
  not because i was a lazy asshole ( it 's not like i 'm less lazy now ) , simply because i did n't really care either way , and did n't feel like i had a strong enough opinion to vote . 
  i feel like the way i vote nowadays is a lot more relevant because i 've learned a lot more and i have much stronger convictions . 
  i 'm glad i was n't forced to vote back then because i would probably have picked the left-wing ballot just because that 's what other young people do , not because i really had an opinion . 
  i mean , i would also prefer it if there was no brexit . 
  but i feel like people who want to force young people to vote only want to do that because it serves their interests . 
  i 'm no pro-brexiter , but come on people . 
  of course after huge news like this , there is so much uncertainty that the markets will drop . 
  the initial drop does n't mean much though , it 's in the medium/long term that we 'll see how the markets behave . 
  you ca n't read too much in this drop . 
  nah , google-translating english to french does n't work well at all . 
  to be fair , unless your native language is a slavic language , you have to be a goddamn genius to write correct polish . 
  this is how i feel when i read news about france on reddit . 
  you can post anything on reddit someone nobody knows from country x said , and people will assume they 're famous is that country . 
  [ this is an example of a post talking about a `` french mep '' who 's virtually unknown in france , for instance . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4pjym6/french_mep_jeanluc_schaffhauser_has_blamed/ ) it really makes me wonder how relevant what i read on / r/europe is on a daily basis . 
  efta works for norway , no quotas on their fisheries , no voting rights but in any case they are a small country so it dose n't change much , they pay a bit much for what they get but they 're rich as fuck anyway ... 
  they do n't get things like eu research grant but again , they do n't need eu money . 
  and they get access to the single market . 
  for the uk , it would be a different story . 
  what you 're saying makes no sense . 
  if the uk was in the eea it would pay much less per capita than norway ... 
  ... which is exactly my point ?

  ( but he betrayed him when he suddenly decided to quit and run for president - at a time when hollande was still planning on running for his reelection !, 
  macron was `` created '' by hollande , so that must have been hard to swallow : a young lad who climbed the political ladder thanks to you , first when you picked him as an adviser and then when you appointed him minister although he had never been elected anywhere . 
  but rumors say they are still in good terms - some journalists even claim hollande advises macron through text messages , idk whether that 's true or not but it sounds credible to me ) . 
  - backing hamon would sound more logical to me , just because hollande was the leader of the socialist party for years and supporting another candidate - for the first round - would really be unprecedented and create chaos , especially after valls ' statement . 
  ( but hollande also considers hamon a traitor , for criticizing his policies . 
  he fired him for that so i do n't think he has great respect for him . 
  plus if he intends to back hamon , why has n't he done it already ? ), 
  - in any case , hollande probably is n't going to be helping the candidate he decides to back , given his low approval rating . 
  so maybe he wo n't say anything before the first round and only back someone for the second round ? 
  ( i do n't know , on the one hand hollande is famous for having a hard time taking decisions and waiting until the last minute before doing so , on the other hand i have a hard time believing he wo n't take part and he 's also famous for being an avid political strategist ) . 
  - i just googled , to see if i missed anything , and apparently ( on the 10th of march ) he told a journalist he would answer `` later '' . 
  which i assume means he does intend to back one of the two before the first round ... ( he 's pretty much absent from the news , but no doubt journalists will start asking the question more and more often now that the end is near . 
  he 's someone who looooves `` teasing '' journalists , so i would n't be surprised if he decided to play with them in the next two weeks , giving subtle answers that can be interpretated both ways , before finally giving a clear answer ) . 
  another article says that hollande is focusing on fighting le pen ... which in my opinion hints at a probable support for macron rather than hamon - same reasoning as valls . 
  ( but again , if he does so , it wo n't help macron : hollande knows it , so maybe he 'll decide to remain silent ) . 
  tl ; dr : i really do n't know , 
  thanks , that was nicely explained . 
  unfortunately i ca n't find any . 
  france 24 english had a live stream on their youtube channel but apparently it 's no longer available as a replay . 
  france : * 21 days left before the first round of the presidential election * . 
  - ** valls betrays hamon and breaks his promise by backing macron . 
  ** former prime minister manuel valls , who competed against benoit hamon during the socialist primary and lost , just delivered the final blow against the candidate of his party by stating he would vote for centrist candidate emmanuel macron ( instead of benoit hamon ) . 
  ( after losing against benoit hamon in january , manuel valls went on holiday for 3 weeks . 
  when he came back , instead of either remaining silent or campaigning in favour of the socialist candidate , he orchestrated a campaign against hamon . 
  so it was already clear to everyone that he was siding with macron but that was n't enough : 3 weeks before the election , he had to publicly support him ! ), 
  valls had signed a paper promising he would support and campaign in favour of whoever won the primary . 
  but the socialist party wo n't sanction him . 
  emmanuel macron 's reaction was `` cold '' : he stated that he thanked manuel valls but that he wo n't necessarily be including him in his future government , since he wants to renew the french political landscape . 
  ( he said that after valls ' statement , but he had already said it the day before , which did n't make valls hesitate apparently ) . 
  - ** jean-luc m\u00e9lenchon is now 4rth ** . 
  - pretty logically , benoit hamon ( who already had trouble convincing voters in this context = no help from his `` friends '' ) is now polled around 10 % , whereas `` far-left '' candidate jean-luc m\u00e9lenchon is on the rise ( polled around 15 % ) . 
  it was the opposite until now . 
  - macron and le pen are stable ( both around 25 % ) . 
  as for fillon i 'm not too sure because i think i 've seen some polls recently saying he was on the rise again , but other polls say he 's losing points ( putting him between 18 % and 16 % ) ... so , how far behind him is m\u00e9lenchon ? 
  could he reach the 3rd place ? 
  hard to say . 
  - ** macron is trying to prove he 's not a hollande copycat ** . 
  many ( old ) politicians ( from all tendencies ) have backed emmanuel macron . 
  is it a blessing or a curse ? 
  - well , on the one hand , since he 's young and starting from scratch with a new political movement , he needed support to appear `` presidential '' and to convince people he could actually be able to form a government . 
  - but on the other hand , his campaign is based on the promise to offer new solutions and `` revolutionize '' things ( he published a book entitled `` revolution '' ... couch cough ) . 
  many of the politicians who have backed him are old , retired folks , which does n't really fit with this narrative . 
  plus , many are socialists , therefore his opponents ( fran\u00e7ois fillon and marine le pen mostly ) are attacking him , saying he 's `` emmanuel hollande '' and will in fact just carry on with the same political line as hollande and valls . 
  so macron is trying to find right-wing backers to balance things out ( although , some could argue - myself included - that in fact most of those who backed him are right-wing ) and he reached out to christian estrosi , a famous sarkozyst . 
  how will his supporters react ? 
  - in my opinion , it was n't a smart move : estrosi does n't have a good image and most people probably think macron should n't look for endorsements that way . 
  but maybe they 'll passively give him another pass ... 
  i 'm betting on this . 
  - ** penelope fillon was formally indicted ** . 
  as part of the `` penelope gate '' scandal . 
  it 's not a surprise : her husband was indicted already and she joined him after being interviewed by the judges in charge of the investigations . 
  - ** new elements were published about marine le pen 's judicial cases '' ** . 
  but that does n't matter , her supporters do n't care and it 's not being covered that much in the media . 
  - ** there will be a debate on tuesday , with all the candidates ( 11 ) ** . 
  the previous one ( with only the 5 main candidates ) was quite easy to follow although it lasted 3h30 . 
  this one is probably going to be challenging to watch , but , well , that 's the democratic thing to do . 
  ( it will be on cnews and bfmtv . 
  not sure where you can follow it from abroad and if it will be translated or not ) . 
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- - ** negociations are ongoing in french guiana , between the government and protesters ** . 
  guianans launched a general strike to protest against their conditions . 
  at first the government refused to listen to their queries , before finally sending two ministers . 
  the overseas territories minister apologized for not coming sooner and for the decades-long lack of funding in guiana , which is historic and was very much appreciated by the community . 
  they offered a 1 billion euros plan but it was judged unsufficient ( french guyana is estimated to be 27 years behind in terms of development , compared to the mainland ... the situation is similar in all of our overseas territories , but guiana is the worst ) . 
  - ** french banks declare 5,5 billions of profits in tax heavens ** . 
  ... ( according to an oxfam report , obviously french banks are n't the only ones to do it ) . 
  - ** a chinese man was killed by the police , leading to protests this week ** . 
  the police was apparently called because of shouting inside his apartment . 
  when they arrived , he was preparing fish with cissors and they claim he attacked them , injuring one police officer and prompting the others to open fire in self-defense . 
  the man 's children however claim that he did n't attack them and that they just killed him for no reason . 
  i do n't know whether the alledge injury has been proven by a doctor or not . 
  the chinese community organised protests all week long . 
  - ** an `` amber alert '' was launched to find a little boy , kidnapped by his father ** . 
  usually the kids are found ( alive ) very quickly each time this system is used . 
  but not this time : they are still looking for him . 
  ( the father escaped from prison in december - well `` escaped '' as in , he did n't come back after a permission - and he 's from the travellers community , so he has many family members to hide him ) . 
  ( [ link to the pictures ] ( http://img.20mn.fr/adk4134etw27gdi5culfwa/2048x1536-fit_petit-vicente-5-ans-demi-enleve-pere-pres-clermont-ferrand-29-mars-2017.jpg ) , in case he went to spain ... ? 
  he 's supposed to be in south-west france , but you never know ) . 
  yes , thanks , 
   a bishop from cluj said romania would not fail demographically if every young family had three children , one for the mother , one for the father and one for the country and the church . 
  how do you decide which is which ?? 
   ( i guess the one for the country has to be a boy )  our minister of labor , who 's one of the worst people in our government and who , for example , wants to double all salaries below the sum of 870 euro ( only for state employees and gradually until the end of her term ) , said imf should mind its own business . 
  to quote her , `` psd ( her party ) won the elections , not imf . '' . 
  what 's wrong with that ? 
  france : politics * ( 28 days left before the 1st round of the presidential election ) * . 
  - ** first presidential debate between the 5 leading candidates ** . 
  - nearly 10 million people watched it . 
  it was loooong ( 3h30 ) , but surprisingly not that hard to watch until the end ( for me at least ) . 
  - there was no big surprise , i do n't think it will affect things much . 
  from what i read online , m\u00e9lenchon was considered the `` winner '' by quite a lot of people , but 1 ) this sample is primarily based on young people ( although apparently the mainstream media polls gave similar results ) 2 ) that does n't mean people will actually want to vote for him ( they acknowledged he performed well compared to the others , which is not to say they were convinced ) . 
  - what i feel most people took away from each of the candidates was : macron : `` i agree '' ( many times throughout the debate , he began his reply by saying he agreed with what another candidate had just said ) . 
  le pen : `` we need to re-arm ourselves '' ( she used this lexical terminology many times . 
  it 's a change from the medical/plague one she often uses too . 
  she spent a lot more time than the others focusing on what is wrong today instead of detailing what she suggests we should do ) . 
  fillon : `` i made some mistakes but please vote for me because i 'm the only realistic option to reform the country '' . 
  ( also , we later learned that he received text messages during the debate , from his pr advisor . 
  i do n't think it really helped him ) . 
  hamon and m\u00e9lenchon : i ca n't think of a short phrase to sum up their performance . 
  i thought they were both good at explaining their plans and came up with good one-liners , but it seems most people thought hamon was a little transparent . 
  ( he had a big meeting the day before , during which he made a long speech , maybe that had an impact ) . 
  - there will be 2 other televised debates before the first round , this time with all ( 11 ) candidates .

  * castilian is what you know as spanish , even though it 's only one of the several languages spoken there . 
  yes . 
  in spain there are millions who have catalan , basque and galician as their mother tongue . 
  so , they have castilian ^ * as their second language . 
  in addition to that , the immigrants . 
  * castilian is what you know as spanish , even though it 's only one of the several languages spoken there . 
   most chinese people 's english is on the level of your high school spanish . 
  if that 's true , i am impressed . 
  the spanish level of high school students in france is impressively good . 
  who is going to pay for this war ? 
  all parts of the hypothetical military conflict are penniless . 
  in addition to that , the catalans have no army . 
  what kind of war would be that ? 
  it will be like a bar fight at most . 
  oh , by the way , the central government is not that stupid . 
  they know very well that as soon as the first tank hits the streets , they have lost . 
  maybe they will win momentarily , but they will not convince the people that they have to remain subjugated to spain by using the army against them . 
  people will not forget , and neither forgive , in 20 , 30 or 40 years the catalans will reclaim independence again . 
  your war , would be only a delay for the unavoidable . 
  the catalans will be free again . 
  what a nice display of republican values !, 
  you should put an eagle in the middle of your flair . 
  also , sing the `` cara al sol '' . 
  that would be more aligned with the values that emanate from your comment . 
  make yourself a favour , read rousseau 's `` social contract '' ( at least the 3 first chapters ) . 
  and understand why you are so far off that you are not even wrong . 
  that will make you a better republican . 
  the police dressed as left wing radicals are very violent in spain . 
  let me fix that for you . 
  also , it \u00b4 s usually your skin head right wing `` cachorrillos '' who are the most violent . 
  low intensity terrorism 24/7 . 
  the key here is the word slight . 
  what if we cut every ones little toes just in case when people kick the coffee table it does n't hurt that much ? 
  my feet bumps into the damn thing at least once a month , and it hurts for like a minute or so . 
  i should , definitely , amputate my little toes !, 
  first , fuck you for using the `` hitler card '' . 
  second , cutting people 's body parts because some weird middle eastern iron age believe is asinine . 
  it 's asinine in nordic countries and everywhere else . 
  leave kids willies alone !, 
  bilingual is an understatement . 
  i have been in groups where the conversation was had in 3-4 languages without issues . 
  catalan , spanish , english and french around the same table easily anywhere any night . 
  that \u00b4 s amazing !, 
  thank you . 
  this days any one can be a journalist , even illiterate people !, 
  800m means 800 millis , which is 80 cents of euro , or 0.8 euros . 
  i can invest more than that in poland ... 
  if we are talking about millions m should be used . 
  did you slip from your mom \u00b4 s arms when you were little and hit too hard the ground with you head ? 
  that \u00b4 s the only possible explanation . 
  apm and cocidito madrileno on the radio were so much better . 
  also much easier to do , true . 
  but i still remember aznar speaking '' `` in catalan '' '' and saying `` visca catalunya independent '' :d oh , the radio ... 
   \u00d3 \u00f0\u00e6r , is \u00feis \u00f6ll b\u00edk\u00f6s w\u00ed \u00f0on \u00b4 t us \u00fe an\u00f0 \u00f0 ani m\u00f3r ? 
  i could get use to it . 
  it looks very fancy . 
  not only that . 
  op accuses the republic of `` sympathizing with the soviet union '' . 
  and forgets that the first country the republic asked for help was the uk ( the `` perfida albion '' , the `` archenemy '' ) and the second france . 
  only when both france and the uk had denied help , the republic accepted the soviet help . 
  which caused a war within the democratic part of the conflict !, 
  by the way , do you know which flag waves next to the french one when the anniversary of the liberation of paris ? 
  the spanish republic flag !!, 
  fuck the rojigualda . 
  the history of the spaniards who first entered paris during wwii has to be one of the most badass and epic stories of humanity . 
  cross the pyrenees without nothing , put in concentration camps , given the opportunity to fight with the french army and ending liberating paris . 
  wow .

  i do n't know what else to do !,

  put it in historical context , what people of his time use to paint , how disturbing the image is ... 
  it 's the work of a genius ahead of his time , he was a punk ( and i say it in the best interpretation of the word possible ) . 
  edited because the url contains ( and ) and they needed \\ in front of them, 
  in addition to the license point , we must add that postgresql is used to teach databases in a lot of schools . 
  so , the government can hire locally people totally capable and competent within the country without the need of paying thousands to foreign people or paying thousands to people that has paid money to foreign people to learn to use the tool . 
  then , legalize drugs and put them out of business . 
  are you fucking kidding me ? 
  i 've not felt ever spanish , my father does n't consider himself spanish , my grandfather did not consider himself spanish ... and goes on . 
  the first catalan republic , under french pprotection , dates from the xvii century !!, 
  claiming that the independence movement is something new is a lie . 
  catalufos is the most gentle thing they are going to call you . 
  the second is `` polish dog '' . 
  could spain be more cynical ? 
  the independence of catalonia will be unilateral just because the central government wants it . 
  they have refused to negotiate a pacted solution . 
  there 's a sign outside , a seal on the door and , sometimes , a diploma visible from outside hanging on the wall . 
  you should try to visit a boulangerie whose owner has been awarded the title of `` meilleur ouvrier de france '' .

  what were you doing reading storfrom forums , op ? 
  i was drunk and/or stoned when i made this account . 
  be glad that the i is the only mistake . 
  the debt of the catalan government is ridiculously low on % . 
  catalonia would be one of the less indebted economies of europe if independent . 
  the problem is that the central government pays back so little to the catalan government that the amount is insufficient to pay the basic services ( basis services mandatories by spanish law , by the way ) . 
  the catalan government gets into a little of debt ( to provide these services mandatory by law ) and asks for money to madrid , they say that they should not worry next year they will pay , ... and it goes on and on . 
  the catalan/valencian/madrileno ... debt is actually debt of the central government towards the local administrations . 
   and do n't they need stuff like an army ?

  just saying there are options for those who are concerned ( my kids all had mmr when they were little ) . 
  here 's a french one i like that is n't listed : * revenons a nos moutons * - let 's get back to our sheep . 
  meaning , let 's return to the subject at hand . 
  it 's from a play where a merchant has been conned out of sheets by one person and out of sheep by another . 
  he brings the two cases before a judge , but gets confused between the sheets and the sheep , causing the judge to say at one point `` get back to your sheep '' . 
   a controversial vaccine that we do n't fully understand .

  you can use separate jabs or other combinations . 
   the saudi royals act as a needed check on the influential religious aspect of saudi society . 
  i thought the religious elements were there as a bulwark against democratic movements among the saudi people ? 
  the royals give the wahabbis a free hand , and in return the religious leaders promote the saudi status quo . 
  when will the oil money run out ? 
   many , including myself , dislike foreign money influencing politics , especially in a small nation like ireland . 
  i take it you 're equally disturbed by the money and support that flows into ireland from us-based pro-life groups ? 
  this has been obvious since the 1990s , no ? 
   domestic institutions are the key , and he bang on right about that .

  cumming 's points are potentially interesting , but twitter is such a poor medium that i ca n't really tell . 
   when goldsmiths and scriveners , the 17th century forerunners of bankers , first introduced cheques , it was a striking act of creativity . 
  this seems very late , given what the italians were doing from the 12th century onward . 
  netherlands : nice roads but near the cities it 's like a free for all . 
  nobody respecting lanes on the motorway ; not much signalling to change lane . 
  uk : road quality poor . 
  a lot of people choose a lane and then stick to it , despite traveling at 30 + kmph below the speed limit . 
  the multi stage roundabouts with stop lights are a headwreck . 
  ireland : ditto on the multistage roundabouts with stop lights . 
  country roads can be really dodgy but rated for 80km or even 100km - locals get very impatient driving behind me :-) belgium : not much road signage . 
  road quality poor . 
  drivers quite variable . 
  germany : love the autobahn but most people have a faster car than i do . 
   every traffic jam we found had a peage booth in the end . 
  there 's a lot of that , especially in summer when people unfamiliar with the system get in the wrong lane , then get stuck and have to change lane or deal with a human operator .

  some more detail from [ the bbc ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-40481325 ) :  prosecutors say syed 's plans ranged from becoming a suicide bomber to staging a gun attack , and while he initially boasted of working with others , those people did not materialise . 
   instead , over the summer of last year , he made increasingly urgent efforts to secure weaponry . 
   after he went online looking for help , a purported jihadist fighting overseas , known only as abu isa , introduced him to another extremist going by the name abu yusuf . 
   this second man was , in fact , a group of mi5 officers who were playing the role of a jihadist in what became weeks of social media chat with syed . 
  here 's one of my favourite irish websites , [ dalta\u00ed na gaeilge ] ( http://www.daltai.com/ ) . 
  it 's run out of new jersey . 
  i especially like the [ proverb of the week ] ( http://www.daltai.com/proverbs/cat02.htm%23section09/ ) . 
  * your friend and your enemy believe you will never die . 
   i 'll point to this as a utter waste of funds . 
  it 'll have to happen though , and i doubt it will for a very long time . 
    james joyce  ... who died in the irish free state , a dominion of the british empire . 
  wrong on both counts . 
  joyce died in z\u00fcrich in 1941 but he outlived saorst\u00e1t \u00c9ireann , which was dissolved in 1939 . 
   it 's a language that is rudimentary how do you mean it 's ` rudimentary ' ? 
   the `` gaelscoil movement '' is simply parents with no choice but to put their kids in irish speaking schools because the english speaking ones are full . 
  no , it 's a mix of gaeilgeoir\u00ed and middle-class parents who want their kids to have educational advantages . 
  a lot of the gaelscoileanna are oversubscribed . 
  there 's no magic money tree you know ... 
  reverse cult of personality . 
  hungarian politicians are weird .

  look it up yourself . 
   merkel literally invited anyone from the third world to come . 
  except that she invited refugees and there 's a definition of that term . 
  strange that you 're complaining about people purposely forgetting and then you * misremember * yourself . 
  this is awesome !, 
  the most powerful person in the state has doubts , but still the view of the majority holds sway !, 
  that 's how it 's supposed to work people . 
  exactly . 
  to be blunt , these fuckers are always there . 
  you may think you 've defeated them , but it 's temporary . 
  its impressive but even a 0.3 % increase in interest rates would turn that sharply upward . 
  i expect that 'll happen by december . 
   it implies that investigators are being less critical of other parties . 
  what implies this ? 
  politicians who are close to macron are also being investigated . 
  they 've behaved impeccably and stepped down to allow the investigation , unlike mlp who tries to hide all the time . 
  despite having nine goalies , apparently . 
  sounds like you 'd be happier if they were two good looking dudes . 
  there 's more to it than just low interest rates though . 
  the uk interest rate has [ flatlined since early 2009 ] ( http://static3.uk.businessinsider.com/image/5943926481abef23008b458f-1188/screen%20shot%202017-06-16%20at%20083103.png ) . 
  the savings ratio , in contrast , [ has fluctuated since 2009 ] ( https://www.theatlas.com/i/atlas_rkvpms7vw@2x.png ) albeit with a downward trend . 
  the real steep decline in savings ratio kicks in in early 2015 . 
   ms le pen , 48 , has also denied any wrongdoing and has said the case is politically motivated . 
  that 's a predictable claim , but if the investigators can prove wrongdoing , it does n't matter what the motivation is because the fn has broken the law . 
  from what i understand there 's clear evidence that certain staffers were working for the national party rather than the meps . 
  as to the political motivation , modem politicians are also being investigated - two resigned from macron 's cabinet recently . 
  what 's the motivation for investigating them ? 
  you are a shining example of a principled politician . 
  :-) it used to be common for a company to offer an extra day if a holiday came close to a weekend - e.g. 
  if there 's a tue/thur holiday , the company would give the mon/fri to enable employees to `` faire le pont '' - make the bridge - between the holiday and the weekend .

  the fact that it 's actually the elites that get drained is a massive problem . 
  it is bad when the people left behind and their children are left with no tax proceeds because richer areas drained the best educated , and paid nothing in return . 
  freedom of movement is only fair when there is a geographic/social equalization policy . 
  otherwise , it 's merely economic segregation . 
  currently , europe 's equalization policies are greatly underfunded , compared to the benefits richer countries/people gain from a mobile workforce . 
   http://adst.org/2014/06/france-has-degaulle-to-withdraw-from-nato/ this page is a good example of the historic revisionism about which i talked earlier . 
  [ france never left nato ; a proof of it being the operations france participated in as nato member ( ifor , sfor , kfor and isaf - all before 2009 ) . 
  france , however , left nato 's integrated command , for many reasons , including retaining full control of its muclear weapons . 
   the us became involved in the first indochina war because of our alliance with france . 
  that involvement did not make the us a belligerent , just like the lend-lease act or the lafayette escadrille did not make the us a beligerent in either wws before 1917 or 1942 . 
  when france left indochina in 1954 , there was no us military action ongoing . 
   france is n't a longstanding ally . 
  you withdrew from nato after dragging us into vietnam , and only fully rejoined in 2009 . 
  france never withdrew from nato . 
  in fact , it provided boots for most nato deployments pre-2009 , and positively answered to us ' article 5 invocation following 9/11 . 
  also , to my knowledge , the us were not a belligerent in the war france fought in vietnam , and france was not a belligerent in the war the us fought there . 
  your blaming of france in that conflict follows the same pattern as that of [ blaming a hundred-year-old treaty ] ( https://www.quora.com/diplomacy-and-diplomats-how-much-is-the-sykes-picot-agreement-responsible-for-the-continuing-turmoil-in-the-middle-east ) for the failure of your operations in iraq , or [ exagerating the influence of the british in your decision to support mossadegh overthrow ] ( http://www.huffingtonpost.com/adst/the-cias-coup-against-ira_b_8001782.html ) . 
  this is a pattern of historic revisionism in order to whitewash us administrations for botched foreign policies . 
  it is a problem because a significant fraction of your population consistently fails to acknowledge the flaw in your foreign policies and to reconsider them . 
  by systematically blaming your allies for those , it also tends to build disdain for their opinion ( cough wmds cough ) , which lowers your ability to accept constructive input and only value sycophantic following . 
   the french republic proved in libya how much it cares about middle east stability . 
  france makes mistakes too , indeed . 
  the key difference here is we are able to assess them afterwards and to understand where we failed . 
  the lybian policy is considered a significant failure of the sarkozy administration in france . 
   after 13 years of not even trying to help and only making the situation worse throughout the region [ ... ] for instance , by continuously being by your side in afghanistan ? 
   and this is the annoying part : the way you remember these events . 
  all of the above being easily verifiable ( especially french deployments as part of nato ) , i understand that you can be annoyed by the way we remember these events . 
  maybe the problem , though , is that you can not reconcile your view of the world with the way it actually is , though . 
   you joined putin in using your unsc veto to obstruct our efforts . 
  even a broken clock gives the correct time twice a day . 
  your administration on the other hand , proceeded to ignore every honest warning from most of your longstanding allies in the region , proceeded to destabilize a neighbouring region which you left worse than you found it , engineered a smearing and hate campaign on those of your allies which did n't blindly follow you - which still has effects 15 years on , and created the conditions for the weakening of peace and democracy at our doors and in our homes . 
  it feels like being on the shit list of this particular administration was a badge of honor , in retrospective . 
  you mean , failure to mindlessly bandwagon on every decision from what was your worst administration in terms of external policy was a good reason to get shat on ? 
  yeah , if you believe we should be sycophants and not allies , you 're probably right . 
  top research centers are not necessarily universities in france . 
  we 're getting used to being on usa 's shit list for [ no good reason ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/12/powell-anthrax-vial.jpg ) . 
  we may as well derive some money from it , heh . 
  yes , that 's solution 2 . 
  from the moment you understand that it is not possible for a company headquartered in the united states to comply to foreign laws , then it 's not possible to have a company headquartered in the us to do business in your country . 
  i do not see how that can be considered a smart move when it comes to us business . 
  compelling your companies to do illegal activities in foreign countries can not be seen as a smart way to do business , even for the trump administration , right ? 
  because that would mean the only way for europe to react would be to ban us businesses or forcing a split of the companies , which would probably not be seen as a good thing by the us . 
  the thing is - these countries are in the eu . 
  i guess that makes a difference . 
  what the second paragraph means is that any european subsidiary would have to pay taxes on the cash moved back to the uk . 
  for instance : * uk firm gives a jam pot to eu subsidiary * eu subsidiary sells it for $ 12 , deducts expenses of $ 2 , intends to return $ 10 to uk . 
  * since the uk does not tax its companies , eu witholds $ 3 . 
  * the uk firm receives $ 7 , and the uk taxes whatever it wants . 
  in effect , that would mean the products sold by european subsidiaries have been taxed in europe , aswell as in the uk . 
   many greeks are studying in germany , which is good for greece once they return and manage to find work there . 
  most of them probably wo n't return , since their country is ruined and they wo n't find jobs that compare to what they 'll get in germany . 
  in fact , this diaspora is one of the things that hurt the country most . 
  the problem is that , atm , there is nothing that greece alone can do to be attractive compared to germany , which has a large demographic deficit . 
  being in europe , the young , the talentful are given the opportunity to move , and greece is left with nothing to build its future . 
   many german companies have invested in greece , which is good . 
  [ ... ] greece also profits from eu regional development funds , which is good as well . 
  it is indeed a good things , and these funds are nothing to scoff at . 
  but look at how much money these investments represent compared to greece 's gdp , or any economy . 
  these amounts pale in comparison to what the country needs . 
  i 'm not saying we 're doing nothing ; i 'm just saying it wo n't be enough to put the country back on foot . 
  what would you offer to solve the situation , then ? 
   a complete haircut of debt would simply allow greece to take loans again to postpone structural improvement . 
  this here is you assuming that greece is inherently unable to reform . 
  without any proof of it being given , i ca n't take it for more than a pretext to let the situation degenerate . 
  yes , corruption is an issue in greece . 
  as it is in germany , afaik . 
  it 's not merely a matter of government , every large institution has these problems ( e.g. 
  vw 's scandal ) . 
  there is no known silver bullet against corruption , appart from relentlessly fighting it ( afaik , bankruptcy also does n't help ) . 
  and , afaik , greece has done notable efforts to fight corruption and to fix their situation ; unfortunately , the situation is just too bad for them to fix it alone . 
  the issue is that you 're moving the goalposts : tying relief for greece to an utopic situation where they would eradicate corruption is just like saying you 're willing to starve the country , because you know it is never going to happen . 
  on the other hand , you could try to find what europe can do to help greece fixing its own problems . 
  it could be debt forgiveness , it could be eurozone investments in the country 's private economy , it could be investment into infrastructures , education , health , etc. 
  to provide relief to the greek government . 
  all of these worked fairly well in the post-financial crisis us , but also in many european country after the war , etc. 
  the problem in your stance , right now , is that you 're looking for ways to justify your inaction , rather than for ways to fix the problem . 
  marshall plan ? 
    postponing chemotherapy sessions  i do n't consider those unnecessary expenses . 
  you posted this 5 hours prior to this message . 
  at some point , maybe you should cut the bullshit and stop rehashing the same mantra about inefficient bureaucracy ? 
  are you saying the choice of thresholds and colors in the other one was carefully crafted ? 
  by increasing slightly your cost of work and by increasing the consumption in germany , it would probably lead to more imports and help fix the export/import ratio , actually . 
   are you talking about our export surplus ? 
  because that 's something we recognize as problem . 
  if only there were countries in the ez you could help by , for instance , investing there , or poors in germany which could use a bit more money to increase their consumption , or even social systems that could be put in place to increase their living conditions ... 
  it 's really a sad thing that no one wants that money , so you 're forced to keep that surplus . 
   and the second thing was , that the troika gave them money . 
  the troika basically transferred european banks ' debt so that they do not take the fall . 
  what happened afterwards was purely a negociation between the troika and greece , and there is no reason to think that greece was made any favour in this negociation . 
  in a way , it is understandable that greek people do n't understand why french and german banks are to be rescued , but not greek citizen . 
   you ca n't but looking at france from the outside it seems it is increasingly difficult to for example fire people . 
  this is party a good thing but if it goes to far this can lead to old inefficient industries maintaining while newer ones do n't get started . 
  [ ... ] if we were investors starting a company or expanding one . 
  would we do it in france ? 
  honestly , this sounds like textbook liberalism and typical anglo economic news . 
  in fact , france 's policy has been doing quite well in motivating investment in innovative industries . 
  its problems are mostly in handling untrained job seekers . 
  comparable economies , such as germany and the uk , have similar problems . 
  their way of handling it are quite different , with a much lower jobless rate , but this does n't translate significantly better in terms of poverty levels for the lower classes , and ( i would say as a consequence ) , they also have far-right movements on the rise . 
   not allowing access to the single market is painful in of itself .

  when a company is based in a eu country , it can technically decide to do business in all of the union and it 'll only have to abide by the tax regulations where it 's based . 
  that 's why lots of firms are in ireland . 
  and we will control both european capitals . 
  hehehehehe, 
  what 's the point of going to war for belgium when there is eu and no more hostility between european countries ? 
  that 's just silly, 
  no need for war when the walloons will willingly join glorious republic again, 
  ze plan is working as expected . 
  two hundred years of patience , but we will finally reclaim our old lands . 
  i like the way you think . 
  but we do n't need to annex andorra tho we 're already ruling it . 
  the president is also co-prince of andorra, 
  that makes sense in a vienna congress system when europe stood in a precarious balance of powers . 
  today there is no more need to have buffer states and such because there is practically no way germany , france or the netherlands would go to war with each other . 
  to have a `` capital city of the eu '' in the same sense you 'd see dc , you would need a completely new constitution or a revision of the lisbon treaty . 
  good luck with that, 
  or , what parisians like to call `` les beaufs '', 
  people measure agricultural power by exports because whatever is produced to be consumed in the same country is a matter of sustainability . 
  basically countries that can export their food products are the ones that are also completely able to feed their own populations by themselves , and exports are the food surplus they can use for trading and diplomatic purposes . 
  let 's make an example with brazil . 
  brazil has a population of more than 200 million . 
  if they have a total production that can feed them all exactly it would account for a much larger market than the french one , but they would n't be able to use their agricultural power in exports to put pressure or make profits from it . 
  that 's an imaginary example though , brazil does export its food products . 
  even if it was just by total value , france actually outclasses most countries in the food industry . 
  carrefour is the second most powerful food firm after walmart in the world . 
  edit : added a thought, 
  france is right behind the us in agricultural exports in the world , so makes sense .

  that 's why they do n't make money , good wines are already cheap why would i get a shitty one ? 
  i 'm coming for your fucking truck next, 
  the president has the most power and the current constitution was made to make presidential powers potent , especially because presidents are directly elected by popular vote so their mandates have a lot of legitimacy . 
  the president can grant pardon , dissolve the assembly , controls the army , and can even call for emergency powers . 
  he also does n't need any kind of legislative or judicial approval if he wants to declare war . 
  basically if the president has the assembly , the pm is his second in command and the position is the most coveted . 
  but if they are opposed the pm can stop any attempt at reform , because any proposal of law is submitted by the government ( so the pm ) . 
  the pm and his government represent the connection between the assembly and the president , because the latter is forbidden to step in the national assembly . 
  the president is the head of state . 
  the prime minister , nominated by the president but confirmed by the assembly , is the head of government . 
  when the president 's party has a loyal majority in the assembly , he can rule practically unopposed and pass whatever law he wishes . 
  when he does n't - it happened only twice - the president is basically able to only conduct foreign policy, 
  terrorism is always targeted at civilians . 
  escobar and arafat used terrorism when they blew up planes . 
  attacking a military checkpoint by blowing yourself up , that 's a military operation on the same level as the kamikaze crashing on us ships : it 's tactical and targeted at combatants . 
  the objective of terrorism is to provoke a breakdown of society , and that is why it is always used as a tactic against society/noncombatants/civilians . 
  terror tactics are cowardly in nature and have been present ever since jewish sicari in roman judea assassinated roman citizens . 
  sure we can criticize islam on lots of things . 
  you ca n't drink you ca n't eat pork , you have to hide your women ( coz yeah we dudes could take multiple wives ) , their prophet fucked young girls and spread his faith through violent conquest and pogrom . 
  islam has also completely hijacked the arab spring in egypt and syria , and did it before in iran . 
  it is the main excuse to justify the absolutism of saudi monarchs and it has ruined afghanistan after the pakistani and reagan financed the taliban . 
  but i made my original comment because associating a religion with the tactic that is terrorism is a mistake, 
  which pretty much supports my point . 
  terrorism is n't only a tool belonging to islamist fundamentalists and even secular organizations have used it, 
  maybe , but it is too easy to say islam is at fault while other religions have been the cause of as much suffering as muslim fanatics . 
  religion as a whole is at fault for providing madmen justification for war , and it 's not a problem contrived to muslims . 
  what i 'm saying is even though christians might not be the ones blowing themselves up there are some who are in organizations using terror tactics and condone suicide bombers . 
  actually christians in lebanon belonging to the phalangists massacred palestinian refugees during the israeli peace in levant operation . 
  muslim terrorists are not the only devils in this hell . 
  discourses saying that it 's because of islam and other religions are not `` as blameful '' is regressive and ignorant . 
  i loled, 
  omg everyone 's villains are leaked to these papers it 's like james bond is the one who uncovered the conspiracy imo, 
  there used to be christians in the plo , which conducted terrorist attacks . 
  terrorism is a tactic and not limited to religious/islamist warfare, 
  true , but it 's still much better than any american 24h news channel, 
  oh yeah it 's artsy of course, 
  well i mean it 's not like merkel 's best friends are in the mafia or germany invaded crimea, 
  this is basically the most boring , unbiased , slothful , truthful , sleep inducing , reliable channel ever, 
  euronews is yet one of the most reliable tv news station i 've ever watched though, 
  the first cases of putinophobia have been detected in georgia and ukraine, 
  this is as stupid as those who would refuse to read aristotle because he advocated for slavery . 
  different times , different mentalities . 
  it does n't mean we should n't learn about these guys , however single-minded and eurocentrist they might have been ( coz yeah for an 18th century philosopher , savage is more about not being culturally european than not being white ) . 
  in the case of france it is a whole other story , though . 
  during the revolution the churches were sacked and clergy members were targeted . 
  why ? 
  because the church as an institution was completely complicit with the ancien regime . 
  and after that following the 1905 laws separating church and state , the third republic went at it again on the catholics . 
  when these laws were made and secularism introduced , it was never about religious freedom . 
  it was about getting religion out of the political sphere . 
  but right now what is happening is that just like in the 19th century there is a new rogue political force outside of our institutions that is being formed . 
  except this time it 's not catholics being manipulated by monarchists , it is muslims being manipulated by fanatics . 
  it is also a traditional interpretation of religious dogma of wearing the veil ( which is in no way fundamental to islam ) which aims at infringing upon half of the population . 
  women 's rights are more important than religious rights , the former is a right to exist as you were born , the other is the right to believe in one faith out of many . 
  all in all , i 'm not saying secularism is n't supposed to be about religious freedom . 
  i 'm saying it has been used in france to bash religions , plain and simple . 
  it was catholics in the 19th/20th century , it 's muslims now . 
  in today 's world you ca n't even quote an old word from a classic in literature , and you ca n't maintain the secular values upon which our republic was built, 
  this guy is why sarkozy intervened in libya by the way . 
  they should stop waiting for a libyan government to create stability . 
  go in the libyan territorial waters and facilitate operations for the coastal patrols . 
  what is anyone going to do about it ? 
  i 'm wondering what you would feel when the news station says that nato plans to attack your country . 
  like . . holy shit man leave now before armageddon hits you from the sky, 
  gim me a break . 
  repressed ? 
  the fact that no one wants or needs to learn a quasi-dead language anymore is n't oppression . 
  what do we do if a rebellion pops , tho ?

  if you stay in the same bubble sure . 
  but knowing the fucked up electoral system , the fact that polls were most likely off because saying you were going to vote for trump would lead you to be branded a racist , bigot you name it . 
  not withstanding the fact that clinton is , well clinton ... oh also , a lot of celebrities for hilary went on and on about minorities and women 's rights . 
  well guess what , middle america does n't give a shit about that . 
  i 'm not saying i wanted or hoped trump would win , but in the few weeks up to the ballots i became aware that his victory was more likely than initially thought . 
  a trump victory was always possible and is n't that surprising . 
  now le pen winning the presidency would be a fucking surprise . 
  she does n't have a huge and solid voter base to stand on as the past elections have shown . 
  you 're looking at first round polls , these do n't matter what matter is the second round and against le pen he polls around 60 % . 
  but it 's useless since people do n't necessarily vote for the winner in the first round . 
  you kind of do your thing and if you want to vote for that poutou guy then you can but you 'll vote something different in the second round . 
  as of now i do n't see le pen becoming president or carrying a majority in parliament . 
  i would hardly call ump centre right anymore . 
  they 've very much veered to the right when you look at the likes of fillion or sarko if you go on the fringe . 
  neo this , neo that . 
  it 's getting quite ridiculous quite frankly . 
  what 's next neo-neo ? 
  disclaimer : i did n't read the article i just wanted to complain . 
  to run no , to win yes . 
  unless he 's facing le pen and even then i would n't bet on it . 
  tbh he 's loathed by everyone with an ounce of ethic . 
  he 's got fanboys within his party but that 's it really . 
  we need a euro army . 
  damn that gif is so cool . 
  damn i was so proud of myself \u00af \\ \\ \\ _ ( \u30c4 ) \\ _ / \u00af, 
  and estrozy . 
  i think we 've got something with all the dirty politicians with a - zy ending names . 
  i 'm one of them . 
  he should do a napoleon iii and have a `` referendum '' to be named president for life and from then on go for sultan . 
  get on with it already . 
  why do people hate the jews already ? 
  i thought we moved past that . 
  and she has the tendency to get involved in politics/government when it 's really not her place . 
  if she wants to have an influence on politics she should run . 
  i 'm really starting to believe that sarko is paying trolls to refute stories about him on the internet . 
  have you ever heard someone being unhappy about their erasmus experience ? 
  i have n't , quite the contrary . 
  sarkozy would say anything to be elected . 
  i would barely be surprised if he decided to run even if he lost the primaries . 
  the yorks and the lancasters would like to have a word with you about the regal symbolism behind the rose . 
  i wonder where you could find such numbers considering that religious census are forbidden in france . 
  is may trying to get fired instead of resigning in order to be granted unemployment benefits ? 
  i went to complain to the poste office once and they told me it would be easier for me to just have it delivered to the post office , since that 's where it ends up anyway . 
  where i live it is managed by chronopost but it 's not actually their drivers but `` free '' worker ( i would n't know how to explain it ) . 
  basically it 's a nightmare . 
  i wo n't get amazon prime any time soon because the delivery men at chronopost are the worst . 
  once , i had one say no one was home but that he left a note ( he did n't ) , then he came back later that day to say that he did n't find the letterbox . 
  i ca n't wait until amazon has their own drivers in france as well . 
  it works so well . 
  why simply scientific paper and not all papers financed through public money ? 
  we do . 
  how does that mean we 're not stable or that we 're ruled by crazy . 
  apart from the proposition to normalise the emergency state i mean . 
  you forgot france . 
  stop forgetting us guys !, 
  in france we have the conseil constitutionnel , that checks if a law is against a constitution or not . 
  however , we do have a very soft ( somewhat pyramidal ) separation of power . 
  true but quite frankly i would n't wish this situation on my worst enemy . 
  i have n't heard anything positive about being a professeur contractuel . 
  but it may be a good way to get some experience in france before doing a capes . 
  sadly yes until the population understand that the state does not prevent all terrorist attacks but aim the prevent them as best as possible . 
  it is worrying to say the least . 
  right now , there is some form of checks against its use since you need parliamentary approval ( even though the parliament is n't exactly independent ) . 
  an extraordinary measure ought to stay extraordinary and i hope they do n't follow through . 
  on the other hand , i feel like we ca n't get out of the state of emergency because if something happens the president will be crucified . 
  it 's a lose-lose situation . 
  well i 'm on mobile so it 's a bit tricky to confirm but it should be really easy to find if it 's run by a private company . 
  as to the emphasis , i 'm being overly cautious . 
  edit : from what i can find it is run by the \u00c9lys\u00e9e and not a private company . 
  we do but it might be difficult to gain entry into the system . 
  in france , if you want to teach you ought to have either a capes or an agr\u00e9gation , which require 4 and 5 years of higher education respectively . 
  however , if you 're looking for a short term position you may want to look into being a teaching language assistant . 
  i could be wrong but i do n't believe it 's managed by a private company but rather by the french state . 
  again , i could be wrong but given that the coat of arms of the president are at the top of the website , it would be strange . 
  in any case , you do n't have much to lose if you 're really interested in coming over here . 
  but is it evidence enough though ? 
  i may claim i 'm going to come home with that person and spend the night with them but it does n't mean i 'll do it . 
  i do n't believe intent is enough to arrest someone . 
  now , if they 've got proof of planning that 's different . 
  we the french people do so love to be morally superior , especially if the usa are involved . 
  i 'd say that 's rather insulting to compare our friends from germany to those morons from the donald . 
  that 's why we need to invest , silly !, 
  checkmate . 
  it 's time to invest . 
  we 're already engaged in multiple conflicts . 
  what 's one more ? 
  do n't `` you people '' me . 
  trump 's `` architectural '' choice is a classic example of american taste . 
  rich americans have , very early on in the republic , sought to imitate and reproduce european taste -- with varying degrees of success . 
  trump 's penthouse is horrible . 
  it 's bad taste , it may be gold but it looks cheap . 
  it has no history in itself but it does tell you a lot about the man who had it built . 
  on the other hand , the palais de l'\u00c9lys\u00e9e evolved through the centuries , each successive owner added their own patina . 
  the gilded rooms of the palace tell the story of power in france , from the ancient r\u00e9gime to the republic . 
  despite the different architectural style and designs you can find , there is a coherence to the building that is simply not present in trump 's penthouse . 
  lastly , this room in the \u00c9lys\u00e9e is not only macron 's but it 's the office of every presidents of the 5th republic before him . 
  it 's not a picture macron 's office but a picture of the office of the president of the french republic . 
  we have taste , trump does not . 
  the gilded features in macrons office ties the room together . 
  trumps room , i do n't know really .

  from a village or small town shop , resulting in the cops being called and her being bared from said shop . 
  there were then huge protests , with the gypsy camp nearby starting to destroy property . 
  it looked like a full blown riot like the ones in athens , with fires burning , makeshift barricades and stone or firebomb throwings . 
  it 's not like the turks came in huge hordes anihilating the whole of the local population . 
  just like the population in the uk for example has not deviated genetically that much from the original people that inhabited the island , the celts , romans , saxons , vikings , french , normans did n't change a lot of the genetic makeup . 
  probably larger populations . 
  every farmer near a city or a town will have something to say bout the gypsies that came and ravaged his field or sopething and we get at times reports on the tv about the the gypsies destroying the amenities put in place solely for them . 
  i do n't know if that 's justified , however i lived once at a `` sedentarised '' gypsy 's house once and the attitude of the people towards them was as good as for anyone else , thus , from anecdotal experience , i 'd say people dislike the gypsies mostly because of their life style , which can be seen , and has been at times , detripental to the country , infrastructures and so on . 
  something that happened once , a tgv was announced as delayed because the copper cables in a 2 km stretch of railway had been stolen . 
  my grandfather instantly said , `` damn gypsies '' and as it turns out it was gypsies , it 's almost a regular occurence . 
  ah shit , wrong target , terribly sorry !, 
  right , because we are such sexists ... 
  lotsa wanking , what 's the difference between drinking from a leffe glass or an orval ? 
  sure , for the ultra refined palate of an aficionado perhaps , but the general taste does n't magically appear . 
  well you seemed to accuse or attribute a certain mindset , which to my experience is not valid . 
  if you do n't like hearing greeks talking then i ca n't help you , i myself do n't like hearing italians because i dislike the language but i 'm not calling them out . 
  right , the glass does everything ... 
  i actually had orval twice , though the second time should n't count because there were deposits floating in the unopened bottle . 
  wonder how long it was in my grandfather 's cellar . 
  it had a fruity/nutty taste but it was n't very strong because it had aged . 
  if that bottle was fresh i might have liked but there was nothing in common with the first bottle i tried . 
  on an ongoing debate and controversy presenting the situation or the facts , trying to portray the points claimed by either side is not being politicaly correct , it 's being fair and trying to project as little bias as possible . 
  at least in my opinion . 
  you seemed to ask if english was as prevalent as in cyprus , which , even though greeks tend to be good with english , is not the case . 
  interstingly most greeks use this term , along with fyrom and skopje . 
  i wonder what that means , since the current environmental regulations require companies to find a way to reuse their waste , instead of it being stored . 
  the higher the percentage is reused ( and the higher the monetary benefit , if i recall well ) , the less are the taxes . 
  thus my question is what exactly they 'll do . 
  will they increase incentives ? 
  orval was rather generic but it was supermarket bought , in france , would there be a difference with one from a bar or i n belgium ? 
  they put the loon on the wall, 
  cyprus can into baltics ? 
  it 's probably not related , but there 's a tea called yunan which , if i recall well , comes from a region in east asia . 
  any link or not at all ? 
  well some people are not interested by specific cultures , it 's like not being interested in a particular book . 
  for example i 'm not into south american history . 
  yes , luke , that 's the one . 
  marcus ( markos ) could be , though i 've got no idea . 
  indeed , except for those like peter , which comes from the greek petros , stone . 
  there 's also another one but since knowing the names of all the apostles was n't a valuable knowledge i do n't recall . 
  oh , i 'm saving that comment and the answers right away !, 
  good ol' salem witch trials then . 
  estonian tears ? 
   anglophobia on the other side of the channel , half of the journalists around the block engage in the same , against the french and ither europeans . 
  welcome to the club mate !, 
  down on the right is an ak with the foot of its wielder , the red is a pool of blood and the owner of said blood . 
  his abdomen is also on the ground too . 
  is the image on the thumbnail real ? 
  very interesting indeed , thank you for that mention . 
  it misses a places that seems like imelhange or something of the sort . 
  i forgot the exact wording and it does n't appear in google maps , so it might be a very minor settlement , or simply a placename without anything of import . 
  it 's in the same place as gandrange and the other similar names . 
  i see . 
  so far there are three different opinions , yours , one that signifies a settlement built on top of a sand deposit in a wetland and he third being that it is a suffix coming from the roman - iacium , meaning a settlement , villa or farmland . 
  the first and third can be of similar origin , no ? 
  as for the link you provided , it 's very interesting , though it misses some places which i saw when going to florange . 
  could there be a link with the french word \u00e9teng which would mean pond , marsh or bog ? 
  i see . 
  this is very interesting because places in france and potentially other countries that have the suffix - y , - sy or - cy are indicators of gallo-roman villas , such as taissy , moncy , atigny and so on . 
  there are many places , from the champagne region to the netherlands with names finishing in - ange , such as bourtange ( second pic ) , hagondage , florange , gandrange and so on . 
  anybody knows what that suffix means ? 
   since when are political parties characterised by some of the nutters who vote for them ? 
  particularly when the leaders publicly denounce and expel such people from their organisations and do n't have nazi policies . 
  jean-marie le pen held racist opinions for the better part of this past half century . 
  he was the founder and the leader of the fn since its creation and up until 2010 or so . 
  it is thus a very valid concern for oneself to have regarding the true ideology behind said party , potentially regarding the newfound `` lightening '' of its extreme character as only a way to gather more votes . 
  however , i do not say the fn is a bunch of racists and nazis , i 'm saying , along with many others , that the past of the fn was very close to those groups and might still covertly be . 
  it does n't mean that fn voters are racists or nazis , it never did , except for some extreme left cretins . 
   of course , the same people who bang on about how nazi bigot racist everything is are the first to make excuses for ideologies and organisations that produce and are associated with actual racism , mayhem and murder . 
  essentially , from the previous phrases , you say that one must not generalise based on some extreme elements , especially since the base party denies any wrongdoing . 
  one can then do the exact same thing for extreme left elements and paint the entire left as being a bunch of extremists , which is more or less what you say people do against the fn . 
  classic case of `` no u '' `` no , u ! '', 
  first clip is not trump 's fault , its the speaker 's fault or whatever . 
  the funny thing is in the comments , one from  smoothiefreak : `` but the right 's not racist ! '', 
  come on now . 
  if it duckwalks like a nazi and heils like a nazi ... . 
  this is what 's the problem in the usa . 
  the right is racist and the left is good . 
  absolutely no nuance and it poisons european politics , as we now start to apply the same rules of us politics to our own , which is not representative of the reality . 
  these simplistic warped views are common not only against the right but also against the left in right-wing circles , as one can see in other subreddits like / r/the _ donald or bars in `` right-wing '' held areas in france . 
  that 's because opinions are polarised and there are only two sides , which is not correct . 
  anyway , the speaker seems to have the same type of discourse as jean-marie le pen had , or perhaps still has . 
  funnily enough he speaks like a true politician , the ones he despises . 
  as for the second video , i do n't really see your point , it 's just an usual riot between twats wanting to break things and the police . 
  it is unremarkable in the same way a terrorist attack in kabul with 50 dead is unremarkable , which means that it is not unremarkable as you say but it is such a regular occurrence that it surprises nobody . 
  is your point that people do n't react to the riots but they react to extreme right-wing discourse ? 
  how ? 
  i often hear about clashes between various rioting groups , usually antifa against various right-wing groups , just like there are protests against extreme politicians that become well known through the media . 
  does the media portray extremists from the right more ? 
  potentially , though there may also be more of them compared to those from the right . 
  after all , communism pretty much died down , is at the minimum , while anarchists are n't really that mainstream . 
  is it a fact though ? 
  as for the statement , i meant its tone , rather than its content , which could be seen as denigrating towards the person you replied to , something that could warrant being ignored and downvoted because it changes the character of the comment from an argument to a personal attack . 
   and , i 'm pretty sure they are not the bulk of the 30 % voting for le pen and neither are them the base the fn is trying to appeal to ... well that 's most likely trrue , i do not know exactly how many there are but do indeed doubt they are at the 30 % of the entire populace , or even 3 % . 
   neither are them the base the fn is trying to appeal to . 
  it 's not in the past 4 or so years , because the fn seems to want to distance itself from them but i doubt the links are severed , nor are they going to vote for somebody else . 
   so painting a le pen presidency as the third reich is quite disingenuous . 
  / u/standy85 's comment seemed to argue that all her followers are nazi sympathizers and so on , however / u/gwengwengwen seemed to argue the complete opposite , that there are no such elements in the voterbase of the fn , which is false , either today or historically , since extreme elements were the base of the foundation of the fn . 
  i also never painted le pen as hitler : the sequel , nor did i say she was racist , a nazi , a murderer or whatever . 
  well you instantly take that mocking tone i referenced earlier and then instantly go on about downvotes , as if you were justified in your original statement and being punished .

  we should rely on ourselves/a more local entity than nato for our own defense . 
  yeah , about that , mitterrand had n't had his croissant that day . 
  he gets grouchy when he 's not working on a full stomach . 
  i like the picture but i disagree on its impact , it 's not the 50 's anymore . 
  the reconciliation has been going on for about 60 years . 
  such pictures are old news now , which is good . 
  nowadays it is tradition that the french and german leaders visit each other first after their election . 
  real history in the making : [ de gaulle & adenauer in 1962 ] ( http://i0.wp.com/roadsmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/adenauer_degaulle_moe120707_dapd.jpeg?fit=3000%2c1317 ) [ kohl & mitterrand in 1985 ] ( http://img.20mn.fr/hqfhaqpjtouovnft61entw/648x415_president-francais-francois-mitterrand-a-gauche-chancelier-allemand-helmut-kohl-a-gauche-scellent-entente-retrouvee-verdun-22-septembre.jpg ) germany is our best eurobro . 
  several of them have very exotic names : - panama : the balboa - bolivia : the boliviano - venezuela : the bolivar - paraguay : the guarani, 
  i thought that song was rather boring honestly , it felt like one long intro . 
  i tuned it out waiting for it to pick up a bit but it never did , and when it ended i was surprised like `` what , this is it ? '', 
  a surprise , to be sure , but a welcome one . 
  it 's fun to say too . 
  i feel better knowing we have all this nice stuff all over the country . 
  i do n't want to be too specific , but it 's part of the urban jungle surrounding paris . 
  it 's not commie-block bad , but clearly nothing to write home about . 
  breton names also end in - ac, 
  hehehe , yeah we know !, 
  * remember you live in an ugly concrete suburb * ah right , not me . 
   if she is so determined to work for the eu then she should become an eu citizen yes that is indeed what i meant by `` unless she radically alters her life '' . 
  look , the point is how things are much more complicated for people in her situation now that brexit is definitely happening . 
  you ca n't just make it better by saying `` well just find something completely different in the uk and it 's all fine and dandy '' . 
  and honestly , can you really blame her for commiting to this particular career path , considering how unlikely it was that brexit would pass ? 
  i 'll remind you that leave won with 51,9 % , not exactly a landslide . 
  maybe have a bit of empathy for someone who 's going to be in for a difficult time against their will . 
   there was never any guarantee she would get an eu job but there was a chance , even if not immediately upon graduation , and now that chance is gone forever ( unless she radically alters her life ) . 
  thank you for admitting it at last , i was losing hope that you 'd see the point . 
  seriously ? 
  you 're just repeating your comment with different words . 
  i guess i 'll do the same : she wanted and studied for an ** eu job ** , and now she ca n't get it . 
  there 's no way you can bullshit yourself out of this . 
  she 's likely going to be out of the job she studied for is the point . 
  what you 're implying is basically like telling an unemployed accountant `` why are you still on unemployment , i sent you very good offers for marketing jobs '' . 
  i see , that makes sense . 
  mostly i 'm sorry for her that she 's probably been studying and working hard for a career that she may never have ... 
  it 's easy for me to say , but obtaining french citizenship does n't seem so bad if she really cares about the eu . 
  they admit in the article it would be `` technically '' possible for her to apply before the uk actually leaves , but what 's the point ? 
  why commit to a career that 's going to be in jeopardy after 1 year or so ? 
  in france we say `` they want butter , butter money , and the milkmaid 's ass too '', 
  i 'm not going to slam her just for being british , but her calling this whole thing `` madness '' ... 
  i just want to tell her `` duh , what did you think was going to happen '' . 
  it 's obvious you ca n't apply for a government job in a region where you 're not ( going to be ) a citizen . 
  solving the case of the brits currently employed as eu public servants is already going to be a headache , i can see why they do n't want to make their pile of problems any bigger . 
  at least not until we have a better vision of how brexit is going to be rolled out . 
   switching from the version that we have now to a more acrobatics style show that does n't hurt the animal that 's how it 's done in southwestern france . 
  it 's called `` course camarguaise '' , and the contestants are supposed to dodge the bull acrobatically while retrieving ribbons tied to its horns for prize money , it 's quite entertaining . 
  he has one , what remains to be seen is how well they will do in the upcoming lower chamber elections . 
  hey , you 're not me !, 
  you 're really just repackaging my comment under your own label !, 
  it does n't matter what the ins and outs are . 
  the point is a long relationship has ended and it 's normal to be unhappy about it , you 'd have to be dense to not understand . 
  it 's very representative , but since you do n't get it for some reason , here 's an easier one : friends have a club where they hang out . 
  then one of them says `` i do n't want to hang out with you anymore '' . 
  remaining friends are understandably upset . 
  of course not , it 's just an analogy . 
  do i have to spell that out for you ? 
  i think he means it like a scorned lover thing . 
  of course you 're entitled to terminate a relationship if you wish , but your partner is going to be resentful about getting dumped , especially since the relationship had been going on 40 years . 
  it 's definitely how i feel anyway . 
  her amped-up extremism wo n't be good for the party if she gets more prominence in the future . 
  she would destroy what her aunt spent years creating . 
  the council of europe probably has so little notoriety that most people would still assume it 's the eu flag , this would definitely raise eyebrows post-brexit . 
  they do n't , we do in fact own the only chocolate factory in the world . 
  all the other `` factories '' are really just repackaging plants where they disguise our products under different labels . 
  i would bet she 'll be back in the future . 
  at her age she has a million occasions to do that . 
  there is another bangor on the island of belle-\u00eele-en-mer , off the southern coast of brittany , and it 's named after the northern irish one . 
  you know how we always tell foreigners to remember `` bonjour , merci , au revoir '' when dealing with french shopkeepers ? 
  in marseille you do n't even need to bother with that , just say `` allez l'om '' every time . 
  if you speak some level of french and you still ca n't figure out anything they say , it 's the accent . 
  just do n't try to imitate it . 
  `` poudre de perlimpinpin '' is an old-fashioned idiom that means `` magic/fairy powder '' . 
  basically macron told le pen her proposals are so unrealistic that she might as well pretend to have magic powers . 
  he 's handsome but he 's also a bigot , you 'd probably want to have him guillotined after some time . 
  you were my brother uk , i loved you !, 
  well ... `` loved '' is a strong word ... let 's say i thought you were rather alright !, 
  you were the chosen one , uk !, 
  you were supposed to bring balance to the eu , not try to tear it apart !, 
  i have such a raging sovereignty right now . 
  i learned something new !, 
  we try to involve wine and cheese whenever we can . 
  we 've found it objectively improves most things . 
  the dutch flag is older so they get credit for that . 
  however , vertical display is best display . 
  many reputable countries like ireland and italy agree . 
  sure thing , it 's been a while . 
  your place or mine ? 
  like what terms ? 
  fact : your opinion is wrong . 
  just kidding , tastes and colors and all that , but we do have a kickass anthem . 
  i think macron is a pretty cool guy , eh defeats traditional politicians and does n't afraid of fn . 
  diversity is the spice of life . 
  and i fucking love spices . 
  the legion carries a romanticised and mysterious aura , both because of their enrollment process ( start a new life under a new name ) and their having to endure a lot of shit during training . 
  it also has cultural and historical importance . 
  personally i do n't have issues with the fact that we have foreigners in our army , firstly because there is rigorous vetting ( 10 % selection rate in 2012 ) ; secondly because their presence is humbling . 
  if all these people are willing to come from different places , learn french , work together and literally put their lives on the line for a country not their own , we must be doing something right . 
  it 's also a form of immigration that i find unquestionable . 
  legionnaires can request citizenship after 3 years if they have shown good conduct , or earlier if they get wounded in action . 
  french .

  have you been to courchevel , cannes or monaco ? 
  these folks are loaded . 
  edit : dear downvoters , why ? 
  i do n't think the overseas department status is what they are after since this status does n't give you much freedom in the way you run things . 
  all the laws voted in the french parliament would still be applicable if they became a dom . 
  french polynesia is the part of france that has the most autonomy and they have the [ overseas collectivity ] ( https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/collectivit%c3%a9_territoriale_en_france ) status . 
  they did . 
  but since france has a latin cultural heritage , i 'm gon na overlook that fact and say it was the romans . 
  the title and the article are misleading . 
  the list is composed of 2/3 of autonomists , who do n't want independence but simply a status similar to scotland 's and catalunya 's , which is n't allowed as they are considered mainland france . 
  if you can read french we are discussing on r/france : https://www.reddit.com/r/france/comments/3wrm48/nationalismes_r%c3%a9gionaux/, 
  really interesting to see the roman influence still strong on many buildings . 
  it 's been 2000 years but the prestige is still there . 
  saint-just !, 
  nice to see someone who knows his history . 
  fort boyard is off the coast of la rochelle and l'\u00eele de r\u00e9 . 
  i do n't want those nutjobs ruining my vacations . 
  we 've also got the [ clipperton island ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/clipperton_island ) which is completely desertic and about 1000km from the nearest land . 
  i propose we give them the choice between the devil 's island , the kerguelens and clipperton . 
  if you did that you could say bye bye to schengen membership . 
   in 1965 , the french government transferred the responsibility for most of the islands to its newly founded guiana space centre . 
  the islands are under the trajectory of the space rockets launched from the centre eastward , toward the sea ( to geostationary orbit ) . 
  they must be evacuated during each launch . 
  the islands host a variety of measurement apparatus for space launches . 
  [ 7 ] they are but the prisoners might need sunscreen if we send them there . 
  rocket fuel burns are bad for your skin . 
  thank you very much . 
  that 's crystal clear . 
  the tricky part is that you would have to actually have permanent resident status . 
  which implies you have the documents that prove you 've lived in the uk for five years continuously prior to the termination of the treaty . 
  i do n't know how many of the the 2,8 million eu residents actually qualify . 
  very interesting , thank you . 
  the principle of acquired rights would probably apply here indeed . 
  but i ca n't find the article you are referring , nor a mention of acquired rights in the link you provided . 
  i tried to find a reference to this principle applied to residency to no avail . 
  do you know about any article treating that question ? 
  from what i 've read greenland is still bound by some eu treaties being part of denmark so that might explain what happened there too . 
  also from what i 've read [ here ] ( http://www.lalive.ch/data/publications/56_-_the_doctrine_of_acquired_rights_the_rights_and_duties_of_private_investors.pdf ) the principle is designed to ensure a stability for the populations in cases of transition . 
  not to guarantee those rights ad vitam eternam . 
  it seems to me that if the uk wanted to come back on the residency rights it had given to eu nationals it could do so if it was done in the context of a lawful transition . 
  all you are saying `` it 's not gon na happen , because i say so '' . 
  like you have any idea of what cameron 's plan is if the leave wins . 
  i know i do n't . 
  maybe you 're right and he will want to keep everyone in , maybe not . 
  acting like you know for sure is first class bullshitting . 
  they say never argue with an imbecile , because he will drag you to his level and beat you at his own game . 
  so indeed i should stop arguing with you . 
  good day sir . 
  did i fucking say that ? 
  i said they could do it once out of the eu . 
  they most probably would n't send everyone back as they need the doctors , nurses and engineers . 
  but free of the bonds of the eu treaties nothing would force them to keep everyone in . 
  you 're saying `` there is 0 % chance of anyone having to leave the uk if they left the eu '' , that is just wrong . 
  you keep saying that without any specifics . 
  if it 's so easy to see `` everything i say is completely wrong '' why do n't you start proving it ? 
  i just showed how you do n't know what retroactive is , and how you mistakenly use retrospective instead does a lot for your credibility ... 
  i just repeatedly admitted i 'm not an expert on the matter . 
  you on the other hand keep saying anyone who disagree with you is `` more than dumb '' , `` dumb '' without the beginning of a structured argumentation or proof of what you claim . 
  so yeah , the `` debate '' between us has to come down to : fuck off you retard . 
  go hide under a rock have try to find some intellectual honesty while you 're at it . 
  well i do apparently . 
  right , because you never say anything you do n't really mean . 
  good on you mate . 
   even if the nation did n't want it . 
  do n't get too exited though . 
  before that 's possible each nation will have to agree to it . 
  and i hope we fucking do n't . 
  european police on french soil ? 
  fuck off please . 
  for instance all european border guards would have to speak and write french , as it is the only language that is recognized on french territory for administrative purposes . 
  to be fair the brits will have brought the end of the nhs upon themselves if it does fail one day by allowing the tories to underfund it . 
  i really hope it does n't happen . 
  that was merely a provocation made out of anger at them brits who think they get such a bad deal with eu free movement . 
  i was n't pretending that was gon na happen for sure . 
  if you look a the rest of my messages you 'll be able to see that . 
  have you ever attended a law lecture ? 
  that 's not what retroactive means . 
  if the treaties granting free movements were denounced by the uk their citizens would in effect go back to what is the normal course of things for living in a foreign country , which is a visa or resident permit . 
  that 's not retroactive as it does n't affect the legality of actions that happened in the past . 
   laws are n't retrospective if they can affect people negatively , i do n't know where you get that from . 
  in france laws are n't retroactive , full stop . 
  if they attempt to be they are deemed unconstitutional . 
  perhaps it 's different in other legal systems . 
  common sense is good , but do n't try to apply it to international law or politics , `` that 's not how it works '' . 
   there 's absolutely 0 chance anything would really change for people who already moved . 
  you are also being very peremptory for someone who has n't got a clue of what he 's talking about . 
  no one would with a serious serious grasp of the situation would be that definite . 
  we are on good terms with the uk and it would probably stay that way if they left , so diplomats and politicians would try to make sure the transition goes smoothly for citizens on both sides of the channel . 
  on the other hand if they wanted to tell all the romanians and poles to fuck off , i do n't know what could legally stop them . 
  of course romania and poland would most likely toughen visas requirements for brits in return , but i think the uk can handle that if they want to . 
  i assume on principle they 'd be back to bilateral relationships with every eu member . 
  assuming schengen would still be a thing , the brits would be allowed to go anywhere in the area if they obtained a visa from any of the members , but they could have a different policy for each country in return . 
  it actually sounds like a pretty sweet deal for them . 
  of course everything i just said is from memory and someone with actual experience of those issues might know about a principle or a law that would make my suppositions invalid . 
  edit : also , as the situation has never occurred before and is n't planned in the treaties , it makes speculating even more uncertain . 
  all right , so you are just making assumptions . 
  no one actually knows what would happen , the scenario where everyone has to go back to their country is unlikely , so is the one where everyone gets to stay . 
  in the end we might get back to a similar situation as the one we are in now , but the immediate aftermath of a brexit could be messy . 
  all right then . 
  i would argue that the eu is too big and too divided to make an efficient state .

  no , i say that you are , currently , illegally , occupying another bloody country that 's in the eu , which you also want to join . 
  as i said , cyprus is relevant because of you stating `` we did n't . 
  '' , which i saw as playing the victim , thus answered back with a situation your government keeps perpetrating , knowingly . 
  nothing to do with russia but you specifically say `` we did n't raid russian . . '' , well yes , you do worse , albeit marginally . 
  but that 's not you asa person , or russians in generak , just the government . 
  constantinople is n't relevant as no country of that time exists . 
  cyprus is relevant . 
  yeah , you just occupy norhern cyprus . . 
  as i said , it 's been ten years and greece is bulking . 
  concessions must be made , and not giving any support to the state is not part of a concession . 
  they tell them to spend less but at the same time to spend more and to hire people . 
  give a carrot and a stick , not spanks for things that are not our fault . 
  i do n't like it when it 's not done for the past 10 years and what is currently done is the opposite of lightening the burden . 
  i feel like m\u00e9lenchon is a nice person * au fond * but in order to be `` incorruptible '' he puts his politics before his common sense . 
  true enough , there 's a lot of defeatism , but the fn tends to relish in the posibility of a defeat of the eu , while the others are just blas\u00e9 . 
  accept eu help to kzep the migrants in ? 
  i do n't like it , but say we accept it , what 's the incentive ? 
  how can greece cope , there 's not enough money to run the state in the first place . 
  at least fund them . 
  greec has asked for help in that regard for years and nothing is done . 
  i do n't think it 's a strawmab , rather an exageration . 
  i also thought that you were going for leaving the eu , not only schengen , which would put you close to le pen 's policy which is defeatist , imo . 
  so the eu has responsibilities towards non schengen and non eu but fucks over its own member in doing so . 
  great stuff . 
  assuming you are right , who will cover the costs of those migrants ? 
  remember , for greece this migrant crisis has been going on since before the arab spring and not much help has been given in that time . 
  schengen and the eu is france 's way . 
  we created it , we 'll remain in it until the boat sinks or until we patch the holes . 
  if we are n't determined to make europe what we set out to make it into then we may as well shut our borders and become isolationist , because that means we failed to make work something that took years and a lot of blood to create . 
  but is h\u00fcrriyet trully independent ? 
  i do n't know , just asking . 
  oh no , not at all , i do it myself too , quite a normal thing to do if one sees something he thinks is wrong . 
  no , what journo said . 
  that kind of comment has as much worth or validity as all those `` somerhing something xxx something something '' that just want to make fun of the oposing opinion ( s ) as not valid . 
  i file those under the word shitpost . 
  it was critical , but now it 's worse . 
  i 'm nit able to back my claim right now but i think the situation was less critical before and the number of fake syrians lower . 
  now the `` syrians '' are everywhere and are processed more easily no matter if they are accepted or not , they waste ressources and can still remain in the country . 
  i think it 'd be best not to believe either and whenever seeing their articles take them with a pinch of salt , knowing there may be some bias . 
  perhaps some writers are gulenists and others erdoganists . 
  the above link can be contested , since the media company has ties with erdogan . 
  therefore you comment may be rather silly . 
  i would have said it 's the whole problem with the pashtuns bein regarded badly and the reacting by boosting taliban ranks . 
  yes but stating the obvious had the result to increase the amount of incoming `` syrians '' . 
  had she not said anything thesituation may have been less critical . 
  if i recall well the thessaloniki airport was rather profitable . 
  other were n't like the railways , absolutely , and on the other hand others were . 
  and in the end when all the assets of greece are sold off cheap , everything will be rose and dandy , while those assets will be making profits for the owner ... 
  and the alternative is to reduce greece to an absolutely impotent member , whose ressources and infrastructure is sold ofr to the eu and is left with nothing to start anew . 
  sounds better ... 
  another plane *, 
  have n't yet been called since i 'm studying but the father of a friend saw a frigate off evia in the 90 's . 
  it may not be true , so take that with a grain of salt , but if it is then the frigate was 200 km in greek waters , which is crazy deep . 
  bah , happens all the time . 
  2 years ago you 'd be able to shoot the f-16s with a stone as they passed above limnos . 
  the previous years were the same , albeit less low . 
  and i 'm not sure if the stone part is an exageration . 
  in 2006 or 2007 greek jets fired warning shots , tracers , above a tourist resort on the same island . 
  and that is just in the summer , only in august . 
  edit : removed pleonasm and typo second edit : i would n't mind turkish jets flying over greece if it was for training , or even if they just wanted to , as long as they asked permission . 
  i really ca n't find any other way to answer to you than by spewing insults , so let 's keep it civil , all-right ? 
  of course , and my home in thessaloniki is sultan gollum 's summer residence . 
  two years ago they flown over limnos . 
  not contested . 
  it 's a rhetorical tool i believe , dehumanise your oposition and you 'll gain influence . 
  the left and more right use it interchangably all the time . 
  which greece actually agrees to ... you 're barking at the wrong tree, 
  ah , i see but i do n't think they did n't do a honest effort , since they did end up rounding them up , and to my knowledge igoumenitsa is now relatively calm . 
  however pr is a big problem nowdays , and it is felt throughout the eu and the us . 
  i agree it is silly . 
  i think you misunderstood , i meant that the situation in greece , in igoumenitsa , is like in calais , nothing to do with sending back the people of calais to i.goumenitsa . 
  or maybe i did n't get you . 
  in igoumenitsa the situation is similar with calais , however the authorities are even less able to do anything because they ca n't deport them anywhere and they have been accused of human right abuses when they tried rounding them up . 
  greece has been dealing with migrants for a decade or more without any kind of help , i think that 's the worst of all , especially when people like you give them all the blame . 
  it 's probably among the most common throughout the world , along with the jaw harp . 
  that 's even the word used in the kalevala , if i recall well , no ? 
  pfft , they may as well not stop in europe at all ... 
  i think this is a lot of exageration . 
  that does seem to rign a bell indeed . 
  i agree but then the danger is present all over the country , no ? 
  still , 200km is a massive area , i really ca n't see other than an exageration . 
  20 are ok , perhaps 50 too but 200 is the half the distance from paris to germany in a straight parallel, 
  my apologies then . 
  though as much afterwardd , but were n't they obliged to go as slow as possible ? 
  have n't seen it in a while so i do n't recall well . 
  so like in every instance of history . 
  one murder or one instance is indeed already too much but if it 's not systematic or the order of the higher ups then i think that 's where we cab draw a line . 
  the peshmerga seem to be doing all-right , all things considered . 
  i 'd bet massoud had had such issues , but in the end he was n't an extremist, 
  if they go slower they make more time to reach destination , therefore they make more money , so i guess that 's . 
  this is n't in the interest of the bosses . 
  200km radius from calais ? 
  i 'm rather bad in geography but that would include lille and perhaps even amiens and rouen . 
  does that mean these places are to be left without supplies ? 
  20km sounds more like it . 
  almost all post titles seems misleading nowdays . 
  so almost every expeditionary force in the history of our world has been isis ? 
  both have the ability , but not the will to do so . 
  it would be unconstructive , say destructive and pointless . 
  well that just adds up to the `` complications '' .

   it 's pretty reliable well ; no . 
  the article 's study and many others can point out that no , waitresses gambling their wage for a random income depending on tips is the exact inverse of reliability . 
   but servers are already making really good money . 
  once again you are making generalizations that i do n't believe are true , and which directly contradict the article i just linked . 
  it states :  the subminimum applies to various tipped service sectors ( based essentially on custom ) , ranging from bussers to massage therapists to nail salon technicians generally some of the lowest paid , most precarious jobs . 
   the total wages earned by tipped workers typically add up to about $ 8.75 . 
  that 's not `` good money '' . 
  that 's `` at best maybe around minimal wage '' . 
   `` tipped workers are more than twice as likely to fall under the federal poverty line , and nearly three times as likely to rely on food stamps , as the average worker . '' and no , that 's not good money at all if you have to ask for food stamps . 
   on top of the poverty wages , tipped workers scrape by on part-time shifts that vary by season , often without benefits or a single paid sick day . 
  their workplaces are also fraught with lax labor , poor safety regulation and massive wage theft by exploitative bosses . 
  please read it : https://www.thenation.com/article/213-hour-why-tipped-minimum-wage-has-go/  it 's not an unfair system a system where a working employee risks his wage constantly ; has no security , and will risk homelessness if sick once , can not possibly qualify as `` fair '' . 
   they do n't need to make more money  there is no problem with our system and it seems to benefit everyone involved . 
  wellll errrrrrrrrh . 
  at that point you strike me as willfully blind . 
  that 's trickle down theory , `` let 's abolish the interference and they 'll be more paid '' . 
  the reality is that incomes relying on charity are unreliable , leading in many cases to precarity . 
  you quote a 45 $ / hour like if it were an average while even ignoring my anecdotal life , various studies says it 's far from it : https://www.thenation.com/article/213-hour-why-tipped-minimum-wage-has-go/, 
  long story short , several of them were tied at various degrees to that , but i do n't want to go in details for reasons : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/greenpeace_arctic_sunrise_ship_case that diplomatic incident was bad enough without them causing another one at the g20 < _ <, 
  not really . 
  the cash 's in the eu right now so if i want to bet on ukraine rebuilding their economy ; they need to patch in the leaks in their hull ( the corruption stealing all the cash ) then having access to serious cash lines ( and that mean associating then joigning the eu lately so we can transfert them the actual hundreds of billions necessary over the next few decades to bring them back in the first world ) . 
  the ussr 's gone , there 's only brussels to pick up the broken parts now ... 
  does n't have to be oppressed ; but on their own economically speaking , ukraine are in trouble . 
  their economy ca n't cope up being cut from their neighbors . 
  that was n't always the case , and is n't necessarily the case everywhere , for everyone , always . 
  hence my beef with it . 
  honestly i hope the employees can have the best possible income because it can be a hard , ungrateful job even if people do n't realize it ; and i saw it lower in with the tipped minimal wage in , so to me it 's a bad thing . 
  thought crimes ? 
  they were people that assaulted a sea drilling plateform in russian sea and were plotting something stupid and put a banner on their website taunting they would be at paris g20 ; so they got told to stay at home for the duration of the g20 . 
  hardly `` prison for thoughtcrimes '' . 
  it 's also true that those hamburg g20 riots are n't really helping anyone , had no goals , and only did widespread damage . 
  they could have canalized all that energy toward a more helpful goal than just breaking shit as a first resort . 
  well a culture that expect that most of your income is dependant on people giving you tips and not on a wage still seem seriously unhealthy to me . 
  despite the fact that they now should in theory rise you up to minimal wage if you make less ( but that experience taught me they frequently fraud there ) . 
   employers in every state have to pay the federal minimum wage - in this case for tipped employees , $ 2.13 an hour . 
  well 2 $ / hour is still a joke . 
  i 'm not talking about banning the tips , i 'm attacking verbally the culture that is encouraging to rely on tip for paying the worker instead of wages . 
  i 'd love for the `` tipped minimal wage '' to be banned however . 
  docking part ( most ? ), 
  of the pay using tips as an excuse seems evil to me . 
  i did encourage as i could ( politically speaking ) the rising of the minimal wage ( & merging the `` tipped wage '' with it ) wherever i could ( even if i 'm not going to go into details because i do n't want to dox myself ) ; i did not however encouraged banning tips for what it 's worth . 
   lots of places in the usa have experimented with getting rid of tips . 
  attacking the issue by merging the `` tipped minimal wage '' with the normal minimal wage of every other job seem to have worked in most states that did so , no ? 
  to be frank , the reason i side with the worker here is because on average i saw business owners being at least low end millionaires while i saw employee upon employee fucked out of their paycheck . 
  you 'd say i 'm making a movie , but when you hear a third colleague that does n't know how he 'll pay his bills this time because he 's not pulling 200 $ in this month , it 's kindah hard to pretend the issue do n't exist and that it 's all ok the potential low end tax cheat on tips from workers is petty amounts in comparison ( especially compared to the many billion frauds of big corporations like amazon/apple ) ; and the poverty/homelessness in some us states shocked me . 
  guess i 'm terribly bad at living in a `` true free market '' economy if you want and do n't have the same culture , but having large amounts living in the street in a state with no real option and who were just told `` work harder ! '', 
  did n't seemed right to me . 
  ^ ( nah tbh it 's true the service is frequently rude in paris . 
  as a french , sorry for my co citizens . 
   the business is required to pay the min wage if the tipped + base does not exceed the min wage . 
  as i said multiple time , i encountered many businesses that did not did it and manipuled declarations of cash tips to avoid doing so . 
  as a result , i have absolutely no trust in that system . 
   are you in france ? 
  i 'm a french that likes to look how thing works abroad ^ ( and probably because my life in france at the time was also extra shitty tbh ) so i went to america & other places ; but currently i 'm in france yes  hy would tipped workers who do n't report on average 40 % of their tips , are required to be paid a min wage , and who report $ 12.30 / hr ( so does not include the 40 % non-reported tips ) want to do away with tips and work min wage ? 
  because it does not fit with my experience of things . 
  furthermore , the employers respecting the full minimal wage does not prevent customers from tiping their waiters/waitress on top . 
  i would even hazard that on the contrary , if more people have a higher income , more people can tip . 
  ^ ( nah that 's just because we frenchs are annoying stuckup asses . 
  albeit a few extra '' ~ ~ please ~ ~ s ` il vous plait '' and '' ~ ~ thank you ~ ~ merci bien '' can frequently go a long way in paris ), 
   and tipped workers like the system . 
  repeating it 100x with 3 other persons does not make it true and will not invalide my own experience in my eyes ( limited admittedly ; but which holds more value in my eyes as a personnal memory ) . 
  the fact that the west coast still has many successfully restaurant businesses despite the continual enforcement of a full minimal wage also tell me the fact that paying a wage does not `` make it impossible to run a successfully business . '', 
  so , bluntly put , no , i do n't believe you , and will not believe you . 
  and there is n't anything really you can say that will change my mind there . 
  the `` tipped minimal wage '' at 2 $ is an aberration in my eyes . 
  if you mean the extra tiping on top of the minimal wage , then yeah it 'd make sense to let it stay ; but i fully believe the full minimal wage should be enforced on all restaurant jobs . 
  worked for tips , in the us , like 10y ago . 
  prefer having both pay + tips ; than tips alone . 
  ( well now i do something else but i digress ), 
   that would be the fault of greedy employers and uninformed staff . 
  the government is not to blame this logic is faulty ; because the minimal wage was invented as a governmental tool to prevent actively companies from exploiting and defrauding their employees out of a wage . 
  the fact that the republicans ( now in charge of all branches of the government ) are actively lowering it tells me that they intend to use the government to do bad things , likely in favor of their greed . 
  http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/senate-grinds-to-a-halt-as-republicans-push-local-minimum/article_23faf181-dcb8-53c8-98b4-dcc9cb7697a1.html  could pretty easy assemble a law suit . 
  many chains are getting sued for wage theft , but it is pretty hard to constantly sue every employers , which is why governmental action in favor of the employees is needed at some point . 
   wtf does that have to do with anything ? 
  are you purposely being obtuse ? 
  i 'm pissed because the `` tipped minimal wage '' is yet another system put in place by the republicans to reduce wages while convincing people they are more paid , and you see nothing wrong with it . 
  from my point of view , it resulted in an actual net & brutal diminishing of income for the workers who have now a 2 $ tipped minimal wage hidden under many layers of propaganda . 
  the last election with trump is now being used to loot ever more cash from society ; minimal wage lowering is a reality in several states ( one you can not deny : http://www.salon.com/2017/07/09/republicans-in-several-states-are-lowering-the-minimum-wage-yes-you-read-that-right/ http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/senate-grinds-to-a-halt-as-republicans-push-local-minimum/article_23faf181-dcb8-53c8-98b4-dcc9cb7697a1.html ) , and you 're helping them with dubious arguments in favor of lowering the minimal wage . 
  how can that not make me angry ? 
  yes you are dishonest , and trying to twist the situation . 
  no i 'm not going to apologise for your lies and half truths . 
   from switzerland  you guys will strike over anything that requires any effort . 
  or so say the guy living on mafia money hidden in his fraud haven hahaha sorry , i guess we ca n't all milk stolen money like your leaders or oil like texas, 
   in places where they have tried to get rid of tips , it has not worked out very well . 
  again you are dishonest ; because you confuse the fact that tip are allowed ; and enforcing the minimal wage anyway . 
  the entire westcoast mandate that minimal wages are fully paid regardless of tips ; and works very well thank you very much . 
  i am not advocating to ban tips ; i 'm advocating to enforce the minimal wage regardless of whatever tip the worker can receive . 
   then you either need to find a job you are better at , or reduce your expenses . 
  you forgot the `` and just strap your boots and do n't be poor '' . 
  yes , i 'm sure i 'll just ask the landlord to be cheaper next month . 
  i emigrated temporarily to the us and i had to actually work shit job to pay bills unlike so many of you here . 
  which led me to quickly understand why it 's necessary to have a real ( and livable ) minimal wage and enforce it , btw . 
  that happens about as frequently as a greek business paying their taxes honestly \u00b2 . 
  about never . 
   and what every american keeps repeating is that the salary component of a waitstaff 's income is miniscule compared to what they get in tips . 
  as far as i know that 's a sheer lie and invention on your part .

  not quite the same thing , but ownership of second homes that are never rented out , and that the owner stays at approx 2-4 weeks a year , is a big problem where i live ( french alps ) . 
  in fact , i used to live next door to a house that the owner 's dad built in the 1960s . 
  they came in august for 2 weeks ; the rest of the year it was vacant . 
  given that rents here are so high , saisonieres ( ie . 
  a lot of the people working in the tourist industry ) have trouble finding somewhere to live where they 're either ( a ) not crammed 4 to apartment better suited for 2 people , or ( b ) spending an immoderate amount on rent , or ( c ) both !, 
  it 's infuriating to see so many vacant properties ...

  yes , a friend of my mum 's , who 's retired , lives in a trailer on the coast and another friend of mine has a trailer permanently sited in wales for holidays . 
  not * very * usual to have them as permanent homes , but a friend-of-a-friend lived in a double-wide in a lovely park back in the 1990s . 
  caravans are n't as popular as , say , 20-30 years ago , but still a regular sight during the summer holiday season . 
  mobile homes/rvs are very popular these days , varying from the size of a van to the size of a bus ( bigger ones not seen as much cos fuel costs would be huge ! ) . 
  all are mostly used for holidays .

  let 's not continue this pointless deaf men 's conversation any further , for both our sanities ' sake . 
  it really is funny how what we take for obvious depends on our culture , or origin , or other context . 
  to me it is a given that if an inhabited land has a name , regardless of its political status or lack thereof , then there is also a word to designate it 's inhabitants . 
  i can hardly think of a single place in france , small or large , where that is n't the case . 
  i do n't know the name for the inhabitants of north-rhine-westphalia , but i would have assumed there was one . 
  to you , it seems clear that people are much more adequately designated by their ethnicity . 
  and this seems to have caused both you to misunderstand my questions , and me to misunderstand your answers . 
   how do you call citizens of northwest terriotires in canada regardless of their ethnicity ? 
  canadians . 
  yes , and you also call them north americans , and humans , but that 's obviously not what we were asking . 
  we were asking if there is a word that designates them and only them . 
  i thought the question was pretty clear , but apparently not . 
   it is also not a historic or geographic region so it does n't have a regional designation . 
  okay , * now * i know that , thanks . 
  you have to admit that it 's not really an obvious concept , that someone would claim power over a group of people so loosely connected that there is n't even a word to designate them . 
  are you playing stupid or something ? 
  so again , what do you call inhabitants of republika srpska regardless of their ethnicity ? 
  one of the reasons was military , believe it or not . 
  in the 1870 war against prussia , half the soldiers on the battlefield could n't understand the orders , and that contributed to our defeat . 
  that was one of the reasons for the mandatory schooling laws passed in the 1880s , which were the main vector of the harmonization of the french language throughout the country . 
   can you use them with a regular b license in france like you can here ? 
  yes , you need either an a license ( motorbikes ) , a b license ( cars ) or a bsr ( mopeds , theoretical exam passed at school + practical exam passed at age 14 + ) .

  in my previous flat , half the time i had to use the brush to push my shit off the shelf . 
  it 's atrocious . 
  i think the point is that the guy justified wearing a colander on his head on his license picture by saying it 's required by his religion . 
  so they 're telling him that if he does n't wear it while driving , then it 's not actually required by his religion , and therefore his license picture is invalid .

  vowel harmonization can be a bit annoying ( should i use an a or an o with this particular case ? ),

  can you give examples of words with these 2 different `` e `` s , because that 's the first time i hear about it , and i 've been living in hungary for a while . 
  meh , the cases are just replacements for prepositions , it 's not as insane as it 's cracked up to be . 
  honestly i much prefer hungarian 's 44 letters that are pronounced consistently , to french or english 's mangled spelling . 
  the grammar is pretty weird though , that 's true . 
  yeah , but even if you pronounce then differently , it 's still the most similar pair of words on this map .

  just look at france , same-sex marriage was passed as one of the first measures of hollande , and what we 've seen since then was one of the most right-wing styles of government ever enacted by a so-called left-wing government in france .

  second , who talked about trump ? 
  i am not saying that the word `` racist '' was the right one to use there . 
  all i 'm saying is that by focusing on this word , the actual point that guy was making is being conveniently avoided . 
  it 's a technicality because the use of the word `` racists '' is not the point of the message . 
   which is exactly why we should not tolerate ~ ~ racists ~ ~ ** people ** who want to throw out all muslims because of the behaviour of some of them . 
  there , can we have a discussion now ? 
   the islamists will push for small changes and the good peace loving complacent muslims wo n't see it as a big deal so they will allow it .

  yeah right . 
  the closest there is is some people trying to prevent the language from dying . 
  technically correct but not a very useful metric . 
  for example , london spreads far into relatively low-density areas , while as an extreme opposite , paris 's main business district is n't even inside the city limits .

  napoleon 's french empire , just a big decade . 
  same for the third reich . 
  and so on . 
  so sure all empires fall after 250 years , if you can arbitrarily decide ( and change ) what an empire is and what it means to fall . 
  the author 's definition and explanation of what is and what causes a decadence only shows his ideological bias : against immigration , against the welfare state and for conservative and religious politics . 
  even though those things most of the time had absolutely nothing to do with the fall of any of those empires . 
  interestingly , the falling roman empire was incredibly more religious , less materialistic and less of a welfare state than it was in its golden age . 
  tl ; dr : all bs . 
  not really . 
  the thing is , migrants are ready to die to come live in europe , while europeans are ( fortunately ) not ready to kill anyone to prevent them from coming . 
  so that 's why it 's very complicated to stop them . 
  but if they were just isis fighters trying to conquer us , we would n't have any remorse .

  what 's the most ridiculous is the party leader saying '' he would be the most representative mayor the people of oslo have ever known '' . 
  so much representative that he only represents 5 seats on 59 ... 
  anyway it would be really surprising that he does become mayor . 
  oslo is i assume an important city to control in norwegian politics , so i doubt the left wing leaders will just say `` oh we got far more votes than you and we 've been trying to become mayor for years , but it 's okay , here , take the post '' . 
  france is a really bad example and you know it , because we have a completely different voting system . 
  the greens ' 2 % in * majoritary votes * is not representative of their actual political weight ( 9 % at the last proportionnal election , that 's not negligible for the socialists ) . 
  besides , the practice of granting safe seats and ministries to small parties is the practice in france specifically because otherwise they would not get * any * representation and grow very dissatisfied . 
  finally the socialists completely ignored and violated their policy agreements with the greens , so i do n't really see how they `` forced hollande to change his program '' . 
  the current goverment cares even less about the environment than sarkozy 's .

  [ here is a french poem also from 500 years ago . 
  ] ( https://fr.wikisource.org/wiki/ballade_des_pendus ) apart from weird spelling ( it was n't fixed yet ) and some expressions that are not used anymore , it seems like the language did n't really change . 
  the rhymes are the same as now . 
  however it still does n't tell us about accents - we know that people from most regions of france until recently had a pretty strong accent , but we do n't really know whether the central , parisian french was already as monotonous as nowadays . 
  some people claim that old french was more like canadian french ; well yes and no , because the qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois come mostly from the western regions like poitou , which indeed had a pretty similar dialect . 
  but it does n't tell us much about the standard , parisian french of the time . 
  i have read also that a bit like in op 's english example , the french used to pronounce all the letters including those that are now silent . 
  i doubt about it though , because as i said a single word could have many different spellings , but was normally only pronounced one way . 
  still it seems that some letters now silent were pronounced back then . 
  for instance nowadays the letters `` an '' , `` on '' , `` un '' , etc. 
  are their own nasal voyel sound ; back then we pronounced both the nasal voyel sound and the n. also `` oi '' , now pronounced * wa * , was pronounced like * way * . 
  there were probably many more differences , but it 's quite difficult to know .

  the eu and its predecessors were definitely a federalist project from the very start ; to see that you just need to read [ the schuman declaration ] ( http://europa.eu/about-eu/basic-information/symbols/europe-day/schuman-declaration/index_en.htm ) , that we still celebrate every year on may 9 : it explicitely calls the ecsc `` the first concrete foundation of a european federation '' and `` a first step in the federation of europe '' . 
  it 's just that european federalists remembered about the pacifist initiatives of the interwar period , and especially aristide briand 's project of a federal european union ( surprisingly approved by 27 countries ... before getting completely forgotten a few weeks later when streseman died and the great depression started ) . 
  they all failed because they simply tried to * decrete * peace and unity without actually * building * and guaranteeing it in any concrete way . 
  that 's why instead they decided to focus on how to make war materially impossible and force governments to keep working with each other . 
  the coal and steel community was not at all made to be a mere free trade area for those commodities , it was made as a union where states lost all their power over these sectors , so that it would be impossible for them to requisition them to build armaments , while all economic intervention ( much needed after the war ) had to go through a common high authority ( ancestor of the commission ) . 
  later the eec clearly attempted to be the basis for a future federal state , by creating its own parliament , government , laws and judiciary . 
  by the way , if it was n't for french communists and gaullists who vetoed the [ 1952 treaty of paris ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_defence_community ) , we would have had a unified european military for more than 60 years already . 
  the center-right is n't `` divided '' , it simply has several candidates for investiture , who will compete next year in an open primary , just as the socialists did in 2011 . 
  they too were `` divided '' between several serious contenders , but then they all rallied behind hollande and he won the election . 
  the same will almost certainly happen for the right-wing this time . 
  marine le pen can be delighted all she wants , it wo n't change that at least 60 % of voters are resolute * never * to vote for her in any circumstance . 
  she will likely get to the second round , but she ca n't win . 
  maybe . 
  though most of them are n't really `` foreign '' anymore . 
  i do n't know if it 's voluntary or if it 's just that politicians lack initiative and prefer pushing the problems under the rug rather than having to deal with them . 
   i mean , the fact that the descendants of immigrants do n't segregate themselves as much in london than in paris is not really something to ` celebrate ' . 
  why not ? 
  noone said it was perfect , she just compared london and paris in that regard , trying to see what exactly was so much better for immigrants there than in france . 
  also she says she lives in one of those `` diverse '' areas , so not a 99 % white british neighbourhood . 
  the eu is ** not ** purely about the economy . 
  it is a ** political ** union , and it does have a military component . 
  every member state has the obligation to help and defend any other if it is attacked , so if estonia gor invaded by russia , sweden would have to take part in that war , nato or not . 
  joint forces and military cooperation are still very limited , but hopefully that will improve in the future . 
  she 's right on this point though . 
  it has been 10 years since the suburbs ' riots , and we even had major government plans about paris ' metropolis , but we have n't done * anything * for those areas , in fact these metropolis plans were all focused on the rich western suburbs . 
  a few months ago the prime minister talked about segregation , and what has he done about it since ? 
  nothing . 
   so basically what she is saying is that she enjoys london more than paris because it 's less white . 
  no , first of all i doubt paris is any whiter than london , and if you had read the article you 'd see she just compares the fate of the poorer , ethnically diverse neighbourhoods in each city . 
  what she says is that paris is far more segregated and its suburbs are incredibly more disaffected than their british equivalents like tottenham . 
  london is more `` diverse '' than paris in that there is not such a big division between the richest , whitest parts and the others . 
   there are dozens of middle ground solutions that would n't negatively affect anybody and would settle the issue for good . 
  like what ? 
  an arbitration court , maybe , but i doubt argentina would agree to that except if the judges were definitel biased against the uk . 
  other than that , i do n't see what would be a `` middle ground '' . 
  protecting them does n't necessarily mean protecting the land - they could just as well be taken to safety in the uk . 
  in the end it 's more a question of principle : the falklands belong to britain from history and by international law , it is a sovereign part of your country , the argentinian claims are bogus and the people living there want to stay british , so giving it away to argentina just because they occasionally throw a tantrum about it and threaten to use violence , that would be cowardice and submitting to bullying . 
  well for historical and cultural reasons the french have always been reluctant to speak other languages and especially english ( in fact for decades the state even tried to * deter * students from learning english as a second language , promoting german instead and guaranteeing that those who choose german would get the best teachers ) . 
  now we finally try to make progress , but i think the biggest problem is that our education system is based on the model of the teacher making his class and the students keeping quiet and copying it . 
  of course this is not how you 're supposed to learn a language , and that 's why language teachers try to push their students to participate more in class . 
  but they 're not used to it and so it 's quite difficult . 
  i can say that every single european exchange student that i knew in highschool remarked on that , amazed about how little french students participate in class . 
  there 's also the question of dubs vs. subs that might play a role . 
  here basically everything foreign on tv is systematically dubbed , while in the countries who mentioned it 's generally not the case , which helps people learn english without even noticing it . 
  so in the end you have many people who studyenglish at school , but they did n't even really practice it at the time , and even less after . 
  still the younger generations are fortunately more proficient , so there 's some progress . 
  haha , the germans sure are hopeful it seems , but no , we 're definitely not phasing out nuclear power anytime soon . 
  increased renewable 's production is normal and has been decided long ago already in line with all our environmental commitments . 
  but our strategy is still absolutely based on nuclear energy , and i 'd say the difficulties with the epr will only make france even more interested in nuclear power , because with all the money wasted on it already , we will want to rip some benefits from it , by ensuring we are the leaders on that technology and master it so we can build eprs all around the world . 
  reading your comment i thought it would have looked like a neat bell tower .

  you just do . 
  someone having the time of his life being trampled by girls in high heels apparently . 
  in france it is seriously ridiculous . 
  they give away medals to their friends and it is pretty annoying to me . 
  i was glad when the thalys guys got it because for once it was a good use of the l\u00e9gion d'honneur . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/authorized_foreign_decorations_of_the_united_states_military apparently some us high ranking officers got it during ww2 and it therefore got included in the green list . 
  wanted to point that out . 
  you did the job for me . 
  thank you for that , honorable stranger . 
  he would probably be allowed to wear it should he ask for it . 
  the danish order of the elephant is among the awards allowed on us uniforms , i do n't see why they would refuse this one . 
  * pretending to ignore that some religions cause more terrorism than others - check, 
   their contributions and sacrifices helped lead to the greatest country earth has ever seen you mean france , right ? 
  my bad !, 
  you seem very picky in terms of nationalists . 
  yeah , i ca n't believe how she will think it is going to help the brexit vote . 
  she should go to uk and support the remain vote if she really wants brexit to happen , it would be much better . 
  it 's impossible to find a good shepherd pie anywhere else . 
  marion is quite the looker . 
  i was being sarcastic . 
  / r/france : ridiculously left wing paris based it guys share their half assed musings on society based on their ridiculously small experience of the world thinking it is incredibly well thought and insightful . 
  i generally go there to keep myself informed but only go skim through the comments from time to time to check whether it 's still shit or not . 
  also if you disagree with them you are a paid fn shill . 
  he is nothing like putin , his name is petrov , he is notoriously paranoid and hard to deal with and he throws his opposition in jail . 
  i really do n't see how you drew this parallele really . 
  yep , they pretty much made fundamentalism cool again in the muslim world . 
  it 's as if we had to ally with hitler to fight nazism because we know it would be even worse should we turn on him . 
  i think he is a competent politician and i think he has charisma . 
  if i was interested in voting les republicains i would probably want him as my candidate but this party allows way too many corrupt douchebags like sarkozy to get any vote from me . 
  [ war !, 
  war !, 
  war !, 
  we fucking love war !, 
   others spoke of the noise made by the pigs as they burned to death . 
  ` their cries were pitiful , ' one said . 
   awwww , that must of been hard to listen :'( the romans unleashed burning pigs on the battlefield in order to scare off enemy war elephants . 
  just to give idea of the noise a burning pig does . 
  it was a bacon joke . 
  it did make me smile . 
  yeah , it 's crazy that people keep citing this studies as if it was the gospel without even checking the source . 
  `` if it supports my pre-conceived notions , then it is good enough for me wherever it comes from . '', 
  reminds me in band of brothers when the us troops make the german citizens from the village next door pick up and bury the deads from the concentration camp they just liberated . 
   in interviews , the director explains how there are a bunch of parallels to his story and how we are treating immigrants right now . 
  so the migrants are the german soldiers with which we are supposed to sympathize ? 
  does he realize that at the time of the movie germany had just sent millions of soldiers to invade the rest of europe and that it makes the parallele awfully counter-productive ? 
  yeah , there has been some lack of communication in the past , i admit . 
  petain tried his best to help the second time but it was too late already , evil england had already involved its retarded child . 
  france of course !, 
  france has been telling for centuries that england is evil but no one listen to us !, 
  i was just answering / u/luxanna 's question . 
  `` he is a mentally troubled man , it has nothing to do with islam . '', 
  x-post / r/thathappened ? 
  that 's why culture and medias should not be merchandises like the others . 
  it 's funny , upon hearing that putin was among the panama papers personalities i immediatly thought `` he is going to say that he was the main target all along and that the others are just there so it does not seem like it '' . 
  typical vladimir vladimirovitch . 
  `` let the bloody hands pile up in the fields of africa '', 
  this is not sure at all . 
  many interpretations for this verse exist and not a single person alive can actually tell what it was actually meant to say for sure . 
  this one is just the most common interpretation . 
  generally you only sing one part of your anthem . 
  most anthems are full on songs that last minutes . 
  the sung part is generally much much shorter for practical reasons . 
  i know the sung part of the french anthem by heart because this is the one we sing at sport event or on national day but then there are other parts i know about but ca n't sing by heart . 
  why is the us flair still available ? 
  totally but go say that to the pc police . 
  except israel can in no way be considered similar to nazi germany . 
  it happened to you guys , you call it whatever you want, 
  double whopper, 
  fuck , you guys are in my thoughts . 
  hope you and your loved ones are okey . 
  when someone says that someone non european did something bad , and especially if it is true , it is racism . 
  there is no such thing as relying on body armor . 
  body armor reduces risks of fatal injury but no amount of body armor suppresses them . 
  think of it as `` getting shot without armor you have 80 % chances to die , with armor it drops to 40 % '' . 
  it 's great and it is definitly useful but no sane person would take these odds on their life . 
  the reason coulibaly got slaughtered like this by the bri is that he charged the cops all guns blazing to force them to kill him , they had no choice but give him what he wanted . 
  these bloody shintoists are at it again !, 
  sarcasm level : rosbif, 
  yeah no of course . 
  especially since there are 22 % undecided . 
  i showed these figures as a pretty good sign that ue was definitly doing something very wrong . 
  they are probably drunk as fuck . 
  edit : i am not excusing them , just explaining . 
  it is worth noting that the same studies foresees scores that would ultimately have us stay in the eu ( 45 % to stay , 33 % to leave , 22 % do not know / no opinion ) . 
  the fact that less than 50 % would vote to stay is quite telling though . 
  according to a study 53 % of french people want a frexit referendum similar to the brexit one . 
  according to the same study , a majority of votants would apparently vote to stay but it would be less than half ( 45 % to stay , 33 % to leave eu , 22 % do not know ) . 
  also , yes . 
  sure , but talking with french cops ( whether they vote fn or not ) you generally get the sense that they are kind of fed up of not being always supported by the hierarchy for pc reasons and that their job would be much easier with a much more controlled immigration in their opinions . 
  of course the reasons crime stats are higher in some communities are diverse and , yeah , amazingly the decades-long french policy of piling them up in shitty project neighborhoods did not help . 
  i am not even commenting on whether they are right or wrong . 
  what i am saying is simply that the mass immigration is probably the main reason why cops vote for fn in france . 
  even if you are in favor of immigration for some reason , saying there is no such thing as ethnic french culture is just completly insane . 
  whoever said that to you should probably go back to school for a dozen of years . 
  to be fair , they are the ones who most have to deal with problems linked with mass immigration . 
  i am certainly glad i am not in their shoes honestly . 
  looking up or down at other countries is never a good thing anyway . 
  i think the main beef people have is that it is an irreversible procedure forced on children for pretty much no reason . 
  i do n't doubt one can totally live with that but it is more on the principle of it . 
  so cut guys sometimes use lube but it 's not essential to fapping ?

  piss off troll account !, 
  despicable . 
  yes , french : the nationality . 
  they 're french . 
  this is how they call themself too . 
  that 's spot on . 
  this is why they are still obsessed with clinton losing and are all talking about the next election . 
  it 's only a game to them , and the only thing that matter is winning it . 
  to be fair , trump himself act like that ... 
  he 's not dodging , he 's just admiting he 's not an expert in everything . 
  are you ? 
  the five best french satirists were executed by terrorists two years ago , french far-right is on the rise ... 
  i 'm in a similar mood than you . 
  all i can see are panicked and unable western governements , everywhere i look . 
  trust is lost . 
  all in all i think that , sadly , terrorists won . 
  yes , good satire is a sign of a healthy society . 
  next time i 'll wear a red beret so you 'll know it 's me . 
  i protect my balls with one hand and stay vertical . 
  i precise that we jumps from the middle plateform , the top is difficult ( and forbiden ) to access , so it 's not that high , 
  do that every summers , always a blast ( i live in al\u00e8s ) . 
  one ca n't be imposed something he chose . 
  do n't you understand words ? 
  * `` we 're not repeating history because it 's not about jews this time '' *, 
  correction : that 's how you survive . 
  and you 're talking about primal fears , here , not the same thing . 
  they are fleeing war and death . 
   so why not scold them ? 
  so , that was a real question ... 
  remind me of schoolyard arguments and i 'm kind of * to old * ( and clever ) * for this shit . 
  * i wish you good luck with all of your fears , and i hope wilders loses so you ca n't have no satisfaction . 
  who said there was something wrong ? 
  you can say whatever you want , dude . 
  free continent . 
   a phobia implies that the fear as no reason . 
  because you 're pulling that definition out of your ass . 
  a phobia can have reasons or not , that 's has nothing to do whith anything . 
  you just want to express xenophobia without having to take responsability for your shitty words . 
  but to answer you , you should n't take decision based on fear ( weither it 's a reasonable fear or not , fear of christians or muslims or whatever ) . 
  nobody except kids should . 
  how are refugees backward islamists while being islamophobes at the same time ? 
  like all panicked people , you are not making any sense . 
   nobody has anything against an muslim with an attitude to religion as the avverage european fear of someone different than you . 
  that 's the etymological definition of xenophobia . 
  yeah they won . 
  they 're terrorists and you 're talking like a terrorized man right now . 
  fear breeds hate . 
   that 's not our problem say no more . 
  i 'm done with this thread . 
  glad you can come out your shitty closet . 
  and i 'm jealous . 
  this is textbook xenophobia . 
  it 's where poor people lives . 
  even war refugees ? 
  tonight , i really wonder what happened to basic human decency . 
  fucking isis won after all ... 
  so ** all ** people with `` backward views '' should be banned disregarding their origin or religion , no ? 
  do you really think that all islam have to offer is terrorism ? 
  * username does n't checks out . 
  it is . 
  you sure do n't sound `` enriched '' . 
  the crusaders did . 
  seems we have n't learned anything . 
  i 'm really ashamed of all europe tonight . 
  well , that 's depressing . 
   muslims choose to have islam imposed on them wherever they go this sentence does n't make sense . 
  are you that acariatre ? 
  a bubble called * earth * . 
  * the ends justify the means * is a pretty good description of right wings to me . 
  beautiful graphics and good level of detail . 
  nice work , nature !, 
  we need a job . 
  material for parodists . 
  i was n't aware that hollande had been destitute because of his private life ( unlike b. clinton for exemple ) . 
  lol ? 
  i agree , cheating on his wife maybe is dishonest but does n't affect politic . 
  corruption or embezzlement are the kind of dishonest we do n't like , i think . 
   i imagine they 'll want assurance that we 'll fully embrace the project , not just straddle both sides of the line to get the best of both worlds . 
  that would be the `` normal '' treatment . 
  it could be worst . 
  so death is our only hope . 
  cheers , 
   especially since the uk is expected to become the most populated country in europe in the next decades maybe that will change if ue countries become very powerfull and attractive , so uk will be ( re ) accepted in without much problems ... maybe ... 
  there must be something to do against , it ca n't continue like that . 
  i sincerely hopes eu wo n't act like a bitch if that happen . 
  you 're right and those are all good points for not leaving . 
  i do n't think we french people are more clever than english or welsh people , but our media outlets are generally speaking ... less dumb ... 
  so i 'm optimistic ( in a pro-ue way ) . 
  by the past in france , the exact opposite happenned ** every time ** a populist made it to the second turn . 
  they got crushed by a sudden boost of * [ whatever the opposite of populism is , idk ] * but of course , everything is theoretically possible . 
  it changes nothing . 
  elders have rights and are part of uk society . 
  but okay , it 's noted . 
  she wo n't be president . 
  but why * `` tougher '' * ? 
  still ... 
  different countries , different system , different people ... 
  that awfull media outlet is a real problem . 
  that sentiment of `` not being part of ( continental ) europe '' is typically brit , tough , and it played a big part in the decision , me think . 
  hadrian made the picts pay for it .

  i mean we have so much murder and bloodshed in our history , there was a time when something like nice or paris was just a pretty uneventful week . 
  we pretty much wrote the book of terror ourselves . 
  damn , good job polan ' !, 
  it 's always good to hear some good piece of news from time to time . 
  i hope the world youth day goes well . 
   also , at this point this meme might as well just be for germany i highly doubt we are off the hook yet . 
  yeah , he just came from syria to have an argument and kill someone with a machete . 
  no one is wondering why he had a machete in the first place , right ? 
  everyone is walking with machetes over here it 's a perfectly normal thing and is absolutly no sign of him having sinister intentions . 
  everytime something like that happens it 's lies upon lies upon lies and i am just tired of that , mate . 
  even the guy in nice they tried to explain to people that he had no link to isis and was just heartbroken over his wife or something , soon they will explain to us that al-baghdadi has no link to terrorism and did all that because he was bummed out because his favorite football team lost or because he experienced racism or something . 
  maybe this one had terrorist purposes , maybe not . 
  but maybe if they did not keep lying to us people would stop assuming they are lied to . 
  it 's like the lying ex we all have , maybe she told the truth sometimes but at some points it gets impossible to believe it . 
  please enlighten me . 
  if you do n't see the difference between two people fighting it out and someone coming from middle east to bring war to european lands then you are the one with an agenda . 
  you can throw frozen burgers like shurikens . 
  the basic \u00e9l\u00e9ments of a zip gun are crazy easy to get . 
  you just need some sturdy tube to use as a barrel and some kind of mechanism to hit the bullet at the right spot . 
  this is technically all you need to fire a bullet . 
  of course you would need more to make it useable in the streets but the basics are really easy to get . 
  honestly i think it is impossible to know for sure . 
  it 's like the debate in france on whether someone would have been a resistant , a collaborator or just someone living their lives . 
  it 's impossible to know as most of the time joining one side of the other was a question of occasion more than anything else . 
  a lot of people who hid jews are just people who found jews hiding in their barn or saw jews escaping from the authorities and just had seconds to decide what to do with that and ended up just acting the way they did without thinking long term or anything . 
  you say that but maybe you would be the guy finding himself by pure luck in the terrorist 's blindspot and just tackling him from behind without even considering your safety . 
  adrenaline does that to people . 
  yeah , ideally it would be better if i did the rest first . 
  tackling a `` allahu akbar '' shouting terrorist shouting `` for the emperor '' is now on my bucketlist . 
  i think he went berzerk and did not think this through . 
  i do n't think you would do something like this if you take time to think about it . 
  / r/nocontext would love your comment . 
  as i said they did not even wait for the conclusions of the coroner so it 's pretty obvious that they wanted to riot anyway . 
  it would just be the us committing seppuku . 
  i would regret them just like i will regret uk when they go through with their brexit but it would certainly mean more loss of power and influence than they would want . 
  it would be the end of their arms industries too . 
  yeah among other things . 
  yep they certainly did not wait for the conclusions to riot which certainly shows that they wanted to riot anyway . 
  and other european nations were totally right about it . 
  it has been showed since then what a lot of people suspected in france : that sarkozy had very personal reasons to go there . 
  i want 100.000.000 $ on my account . 
  it 's not because someone wants something that it is going to happen . 
  is hollande going to decide alone of this army 's deployment ? 
  everything in your comment is completly ridiculous . 
  i seriously doubt you even read the article . 
  i do n't know what you are trying to imply but they are all free to go whenever they want . 
  it happened in the past . 
  or people trying hard to show they are not supporters of the coup even though they totally are . 
  agreed . 
  as much as i like to shit on ubisoft this has no direct link to them . 
  she died skiing , that 's all . 
  why or for whom she was skiing is completly irrelevant unless there is a clear sign that they willingly endangered her . 
  the worrying thing is i would have agreed that it was probably not a durable concern one year ago , now i am not really sure anymore . 
  i ca n't fathom how some people still are into the `` i am not into child porn , therefore my privacy has zero value to me '' . 
  it is so short sighted it makes me die a little inside everytime i see it . 
  yeah of course . 
  apparently it was cardiac arrest which could be natural or not . 
  val d'oise is a departement so it 's pretty vague to qualify it in one word since there are both cities , national parks and an airport there . 
  there are some pretty shitty areas though and i would expect them to be where it happened . 
  it 's similar to the recent riots in the us after the death of a black person in the hands of the police . 
  whether he is a criminal or not is not really relevant , someone who is arrested should not be killed except if he is in danger of escaping or is an immediate threat to someone else 's life . 
  i do n't see how you can tell that they are being tolerant though . 
  they say the exact same things in france . 
  weird is n't it ? 
  yep and strong upper bodies were required to throw grenades which weighed a ton at the time . 
  that and also his old guard that followed him around everywhere were cherry picked among the biggest , meanest looking veterans of the french army . 
  it 's as if you got yourself a guard of `` the mountain '' sized men to follow you around everywhere , anyone seeing your from afar would think you are a midget . 
  for pompidou it 's the height of the centre pompidou , a building named after him . 
  he was not 46 m high . 
  i think . 
  i do n't know , mate i was not there . 
   i was just trying to explain that the current government is absolutly hated by most people and that anytime they appear in public they are booed and insulted . 
  it did not occur to you that it is the reason i answered your ignorant comment in the first place ? 
  most corsican people know what they owe to france and consider themselves french . 
  saying otherwise just reeks of someone who only knows corsica through cherry picked news about the dumbasses independentists . 
  except i am corsican and i confirm you are talking about things you do n't know which make you ignorant ... 
  it 's not about this attack specifically . 
  hollande and him are pretty much universally hated in france . 
  their approval rating is around 10 % iirc which is by far the lowest anyone ever got . 
  what the fuck does that mean ? 
  corsica is in france and it was when napoleon was born . 
  are you really that ignorant ? 
  i may be wrong but i believe the turkish army is generally leaning more toward secularism and democracy . 
  if that is the case it could actually be a good thing . 
  yes , but who is coming after ? 
  not before knowing who is coming next . 
  honestly i just took it off wikipedia . 
  i just did the translation which took me 5 minutes top .

  hollande is shit too . 
  our president game is pretty poor lately . 
  broken clock, 
  populist is a politician who tells the people what they want to hear , regardless of whether it makes sense or is actually doable . 
  it is not synonymous with popular . 
  apparently it just rammed through the security barrages .

  that 's between 0.5 and 1.5 of [ your whole defense budget ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/armed_forces_of_the_netherlands ), 
   russia did its whole `` protecting minorities '' thing only a few years prior . 
  when ? 
  russia backed off supporting yanukovych during the orange revolution . 
  in april 2008 [ bush said this ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/apr/01/nato.georgia ) :  i strongly believe that ukraine and georgia should be given map [ membership action plans ] , and there are no tradeoffs - period . 
  august 2008 , by magic a war started in georgia meaning basically that georgia wo n't join nato for the foreseeable future . 
  us gave georgia and ukraine promisses that it could not back . 
   anyone who was not looking at russia with rose colored glasses knew a conflict in ukraine ( or a different neighboring country ) was a real possibility . 
  and the us in its infinite generousity decided to accelerate that possibility . 
  why was n't there a war during the orange revolution ? 
  that would be an h bomb then . 
  no way poland or romania could reach that type of technology ... 
   because of an annoying little treaty signed in 1968 well there 's an annoying little thing called nato 's article 5 ... 
  if the us breaks it , every country should fend for themselves . 
   a better relationship should be created with russia oh for fucks sake . 
  it was the us that wanted to put ukraine and georgia in nato , it was the us that wanted to arm ukrainians during the war . 
   secondly , the usa is effectively subsidizing all of these countries social programmes by providing them with defense . 
  yeah cuz that 's how it works . 
  you do n't subsidize shit for france since we managed just fine until 2008 when a short idiot decided otherwise . 
   it 's just hypocrisy . 
  it 's geopolitics ... stop complaining . 
  if the situation changes then europe should also change its stance on many things . 
  it 's infantile to assume that europe will always follow the same path regardless of what the us does . 
   the us can still refuse to release them in wartime . 
  yes , if a war breaks out i 'm sure a military base will holdout all the german army . 
  devalue , devalue , devalue . 
  they are trained to use nukes which will be used in case of a nuclear war . 
  basically germany is not a nuke free country , it is a nuclear strike capability country that uses the no first strike policy . 
  it 's all a sham ... 
   we could use cruise missile how much mts would a nuke on a cruise missile be ? 
  0.005 at most ? 
   never ever many little countries with a nukes little countries can not afford nukes and related delivery systems . 
   they are our nukes , housed overseas . 
  big difference . 
  if a country attacks germany , those nukes will be used . 
  so why depend on a foreign country and not make your own nuclear program . 
  it would definitely raise germany 's expenditure on its defense , they get independence , the us will be happy . 
  win win . 
   the weapons remain under us control . 
  and the foreign soldiers get to train with them and get drilled using them ... 
  have you heard of israel ? 
  they 're a country on the asian continent , more precisely in the middle east . 
  what ? 
  the npt is already broken by the nuclear sharing . 
  if the us decides to break article 5 of nato then it 's every country for itself . 
   european principles what 's that ? 
   would just need to have medium range , subsonic missiles those would hardly do any damage . 
  even a hydrogen bomb would n't be that significant . 
  and poland and romania really ca n't produce an h bomb that small . 
  the law is the law only if you can enforce it . 
  no one would impose sanctions on germany or italy if they so desired to start a nuclear program . 
   but would n't any news of romania or poland building nuclear weapons i do n't think poland or romania have the capabilities to built an effective nuclear deterrent . 
  it 's not just about the nukes but also about the delivery . 
  launching missiles from silos is not a feasible approach for them : they simply can not build sufficient silos , sufficiently far appart . 
  and icbms are incredibly costly to build . 
  planes , maybe but they can easily be shot down . 
  submarines , that 's the major one ... and neither have the capabilities to built such systems . 
  that treaty is a sham . 
  1 ) germany , italy , belgium , netheralands , turkey already get shared nukes from the us . 
  this is basically neo-vasal countries . 
  your security on this vital matter depends on others . 
  and what will happen if the us decides to retract ? 
  2 ) there are already cases like saudi arabia with has bought nuclear protection from pakistan . 
  that 's why european countries that are capable to build nukes ... should . 
  the future is far too uncertain to let your country and your people depend on others . 
  i have far more diversity and opportunities in europe . 
  canada even with its french speaking quebec does not attract me much more than i dunno sweden . 
  western europe is not losing any brains to canada . 
  i know of maybe 0 % engineers that decided to go to canada . 
  what 's your point ? 
  yes people move to canada . 
  just like people from canada move abroad . 
  your comment is how countries like canada or australia can attract the best . 
  no they do n't attract the best germans , french , spanish . 
  they have large italian or british populations but that 's about it . 
  western europe is n't the czech republic . 
  might wake up with your dick chopped off . 
  stereotype galore right here . 
  if i wan na work in a company that makes big ass comercial airplanes ? 
  what if i wan na make big jet engines ? 
  how about fighter planes ? 
  nuclear submarines ? 
  etc etc. 
  the us because they 're big and have no language barrier , but canada ... neah . 
  quebec is n't that fancy for us . 
   europeans regardless region , migrate to usa , canada and australia . 
  usa maybe . 
  canada and australia no . 
   the main edge isis has on the west you know that islamism did n't start and wont end with isis right ? 
  and we can not just concern ourselves with islamism in the west ... 
  holy shit . 
  so they basically discourage you to study more . 
  wtf ? 
  here there is no correlation.if you wan na get 2-3-n degrees , you are free to do so . 
  each costing the amount of money you 'd pay for getting one . 
  what 's the logic behind that ? 
  what do you wan na tell ees ? 
  they 're usually the most anti-communist bunch . 
  but in an islamic country ... a great deal will still consider islam and/or sharia to be a good thing . 
   ca n't a christian be against theology and support secular state , while still going to church , praying and believing in god ?

  the timeline lacks a few events : when interviewed about a jewish artist stating that he would leave france should the fn get to power , he answered `` this is not surprising coming from him , he will be part of the next batch ( le pen used `` fourn\u00e9e '' which means batch in a bakery sense , it can be used figuratively and le pen pretended it was just that but honestly this is at best a very poor choice of word ) '' . 
  he made a pun on a political adversary 's name . 
  the person was called `` michel durafour '' , `` four '' means `` oven '' in french and le pen turned his name into `` durafour cr\u00e9matoire '' ( `` crematory oven '' ) . 
  i am sure i forgot a lot of them . 
  more strawmen and twisting of what i am saying . 
  it almost sounds like you do n't understand your own language . 
  our performance during ww2 definitly is our most embarassing moment in recent history . 
  decolonization wars were unavoidable and decolonization was bound to happen sooner or later so i do n't see that as embarassing but ww2 is truly shameful . 
  first we gave away tchekoslovakia to hitler , then we declared war in 1939 when he attacked poland but did not actually attack causing poland to get steamrolled while we did nothing , then our buffoon commander in chief gamelin managed to waste a okeyish plan that corresponded well to the equipment we had and the way french army was organized ( sit on the franco-belgian border and dig in ) by advancing all the way to the belgo-german border , allowing us and the brits to be encircled like noobs by germans crossing through the ardennes , leading to the debacle we know . 
  then when things looked dire enough already , p\u00e9tain manages to manipulate reynaud ( who was in favor of the continuation of war with germany and against surrendering ) into quitting by persuading him that he was politically isolated and gets nominated in his place . 
  p\u00e9tain then announces the end of hostilities and ask french troops to surrender despite the fact that he had no right to do that ( there had to be a vote and he did not negociate anything with germany , which is retarded : if you are going to make your enemy 's job for him , you should try and see what you can get in return for that ) . 
  then he exploited the chaos to give himself more power than any dirigeant ever had in france ( that 's right , the absolut monarchs of france before the revolution had less power than p\u00e9tain ) and installs a french version of fascism complete with collaboration with germany and jewish laws . 
  now sure there was the resistance and i do not underestimate its actions and how many lives they probably saved during d-day ( sabotage of electric plants and railroad caused some german units to be stuck for days far from the frontline , preventing them to reinforce the units engaged against the allies and causing them to arrive way too late to be of any real use ) and even before ( rescue of crashed allied pilots , smuggling of jewish people etc. . . ) but p\u00e9tain will always remain a dark spot in our history . 
   do you really not understand the concept of strawmanning ? 
   first it was ` different cultures lead to no integration ' and now it 's ` lots of people lead to no integration ' . 
  from my very first comment on this very thread ( it is still there , just scroll up a bit ... ) :  the more refugees and the more they differ from us culturally , the less they are motivated to integrate , the more racism there will be . 
  it will always be like that . 
  you do realize that a phenomenon can have several different causes right ? 
   nobody mentioned ` all far-right people ' . 
  i said neo-nazis and solely neo-nazis . 
  fairly sure their racism is not caused by eu policy , and they probably share cause with a lot of other people with racist beliefs . 
  then why are you talking about neonazis if you understand that far-right does not necessarily equates with neonazism ? 
  neo-nazis are maybe a couple of pourcent of any country 's population they are pretty much irrelevant politically . 
   so all racism is caused by illegal immigrants ? 
   i 'm fairly sure ( just fairly sure , not like it 's totally sensible or anything ) we had racism before illegal immigration was a thing . 
  never said that either . 
  it 's funny because you keep building strawmen and then accuse me of doing that . 
  try and pay more attention to what other people say and not to what you want them to say because right now you are just sounding a tad desperate . 
  a sketch about integration in french society http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xbsejy_pas-facile-de-s-integrer_fun, 
  p\u00e9tainiste !, 
   you 've now thrown a totally different point into the works . 
  no , it is still about integration . 
  i am talking about it since comment # 1 of this thread . 
   yeah , sure . 
  i 'm absolutely sure the the neonazi idiots everywhere are campaigning for change in eu immigration policy . 
  if you think far right people are all neonazis then you wo n't ever understand its cause and most importantly you wo n't ever understand how to turn the tide . 
   your argument : if we just get rid of other races , we can stop racism !, 
   bit like saying ` we can stop homophobia by deporting the gays ' . 
  except i never said anything about getting rid of other races , did i ? 
  i said illegal immigration should stop . 
  there are already non-white and non-christian people in europe and i am 100 % fine with that . 
   bit of a jump there . 
  i can imagine someone 's willingness to integrate is a lot more dependent on what kind of person they are . 
  see : british expats in spain . 
  and on their number . 
  if a refugee is thrown in the middle of thousands of natives he will have to behave like one eventually and will have no choice in the matter . 
  if a refugee is among thousands of his compatriots he will have the option to not give a fuck and just live exactly like he did at home , however backward it could be . 
   racism is bad and we should fight it . 
  does n't matter whether that 's fighting the cause or fighting racism itself . 
  way to cut the quote in the middle of a sentence . 
  of course it matters , fighting racism itself is pretty useless only fighting the cause of racism will give actual lasting results and the cause of racism is for the most part the retarded lack of real european policy when it comes to illegal immigration . 
   and if you mean ` the day we just build even bigger walls ' then of course racism figures will decrease , because that kind of racism will be considered normal . 
  how is stopping people ** illegally ** entering your country racism ? 
  it is simple law enforcement . 
  whatever their background , people not integrating and being jerks towards the nation they arrive in will always create racism . 
  yes if jews started to act like most refugees do that would create resentment towards them . 
  it would be the same if french people started arriving en masse in your country and behaving like jerks , attacking people and wrecking stuff while chanting the mareseillaise until you give them free appartments and food , people would start to hate the french and consider them undesirable and that would be entirely normal . 
  looks like the shitty `` let 's replace it with jews '' argument does not work all the time , you will have to actually think of an actual argument here . 
  `` we tell you far right people are more dangerous than isis wanabees why u no believing us ????? '', 
  the more refugees and the more they differ from us culturally , the less they are motivated to integrate , the more racism there will be . 
  it will always be like that . 
  you can not just say `` racism is bad and we should fight it '' and pretend it is actually not caused by retarded european policies in terms of immigration . 
  racism is just a symptom , it is not the actual illness . 
  the day european nations actually get together and agree on a plan to stop unchecked immigration and send back those that are not deemed compatible with our values will be the day racism figures start decreasing again . 
  they should be invested in eastern poland . 
  `` down with this sort of things ! '', 
  yeah and the us had called dibs on the natural ressources . 
  basically charlemagne died and his sons shared his realm into east franks and west franks if i remember correctly . 
  since then it only got downhill . 
  funny thing is that to ridicule us , / u/raven0520 had to ridicule belgium in the process . 
  belgium is everyone 's favorite collateral damage . 
   you ca n't change people 's level of interest , but there are still ways to improve the quality of journalism . 
  i think you can . 
  the main problem with politics right now is that most people think it does not change shit and that their opinions do n't matter : of course they do n't care about politics . 
  associate the people with decisions and you will see that the fucks given will grow exponentially . 
  i am pretty sure that most people on / r/europe have taken the habit of going to check the hidden comments at the bottom of the page . 
  glad we got the fuck out of there . 
  raspberry , mainly . 
   the initial allegation of a man hiding at the factory in dammartin en goele was made on the rmc radio station by the area 's french assembly member , yves albarello . 
  i hope the parliamentary who ran his mouth on air will be severely punished too . 
  german language and its ability to create infinite words is so funny . 
  i love russian and italian . 
  both are beautiful in my opinion . 
  probably the best description of english language i ever heard . 
  honestly italian is not hard at all for a french person to learn . 
  you will get the basics pretty fast which is always encouraging at the beginning . 
  getting to fluency can be hard ( like french it has a lot of irregularities ) but getting to the `` i can have understand basic italian and express basic ideas '' level is really easy . 
  you do n't generally find your own language sexy . 
  yeah i know you guys kind of disagree with that . 
  i do n't agree with the negative stigma attached to this though . 
  i think eastern europe has crazy potential but has been screwed by ussr . 
  as a french poland is seen as mainly in eastern europe but for france everyone is pretty much eastern in europe . 
  i believe poland will have a very powerful role in ue in the close future as the leading eastern europe country . 
  nan mais je m ` en fous \u00e0 la base . 
  it is ours , right ? 
  your food looks awesome / r/europe !, 
  what you linked is different . 
  both cr\u00eapes and galettes are consumed in france . 
  galette are generally eaten with savory stuff ( egg , chees , ham , mushrooms etc. . . ) while cr\u00eapes like the ones you linked are eaten with jam , nutella , sugar etc. . . 
  man fuck bds , i do n't claim to have a solution to the israeli-palestinian conflict but bds are as much bigots as the israeli far right .

  of course . 
  we would n't be able to trial our french djihadists . 
  they committed their crimes outside of france ... 
  and that 's fine . 
  we do what we can . 
  we wo n't start a war for this . 
  and it sends a message . 
   it 's more the absurdity of the law that i 'm challenging . 
  not at all . 
  we have the same law in france . 
  i am all for justice and letting it do its business unencumbered . 
  dude . 
  the estonian was talking about ** western values ** . 
  that 's the context . 
  a country like uruguay that has gay marriage and legal marijuana has a much much better understanding of western values than poland , romania , greece , russia . 
  of course ee does better economically . 
  czech republic has for a neighbour the 3rd largest economy in the world with the 3rd highest number of nobel prizes per capita . 
  germany is one of the most innovative countries out there . 
  coupled with france , uk and some other , ee benefits immensely . 
  heck skoda is owned by vw one of the largest car manufacturers in the world and benefits hugely from their r&d , capabilities to open foreign markets etc. 
  without germany you would n't be anywhere close to where you are now ( how many science and med nobel 's did czech republic win ? 
  how about poland ? ) . 
  of course you 're doing better from an economic pov . 
  if we 'd put you in sa , yeah you 'd decrease quickly to your 1990 levels . 
  so the czech republic is eastern europe . 
  glad we settled that . 
  this is a discussion about western values . 
  we 're comparing a country that has allowed gay marriage since 2013 ( uruguay ) with a country that added in its constitution that marriage is between a man and a woman ( poland ) and we 're saying that the latter has a much finer respect of western values than the former . 
  sorry but uruguay gets it , poland or romania do n't . 
  and let 's not open the racism discussion ... how gypsies are treated in ee vs how black people are in south american . 
  es delicioso . 
  hey do n't forget dismantling the iranian deal ... so a war with iran in 2 years . 
  because iraq went so well . 
  atencion , ay demasiodo idiomas et debe hacer gaffe quand tu changes . 
   op can you drop some more info ? 
  [ touch here ] ( https://www.pharmabraille.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/braille-alphabet-and-braille-numbers.png ) if you wan na know more . 
  do n't be shy , 
  i can not see any problems . 
   for the most part the dreams of a young boy or girl in chile are indistinguishable from those of a child in canada . 
  beautiful :') . ^ ^ god ^ ^ you ^ ^ sound ^ ^ like ^ ^ a ^ ^ wuss . 
  but in all seriousness i fully agree with your analysis . 
  i could talk some more about how the various waves of colonialisms and immigrants created some sort of european society ( like you said very well ) how the chicago boys created a mini us in chile etc etc. 
  i work with some chileans , have some friends from there . 
  and in terms of values , ideals for their life , hopes and wishes for their kids , how they spend their family evenings , you could have told me i 'm in spain and i 'd not be surprised ( except they speak a weird spanish ) . 
  of course there are differences , the mapuche etc. 
  but i mean c'mon . 
  thanks for taking the time to talk in detail about these things . 
   it is a commercial construct . 
  no it 's not . 
  if you offer people opportunities , they 'll take it . 
   weeding out crime is n't . 
  you assume that sending people to jail is an easy process , always fair and always obvious , always consistent . 
  it 's not . 
   that 'll work for minor offenses . 
  also for people who present little to no danger to society . 
   how about building new ones , with decent standards ? 
  does n't really work , just like building more roads does n't reduce traffic , building [ more prisons ] ( https://blogs.mediapart.fr/sylvain-lhuissier/blog/100816/lutte-contre-la-surpopulation-carcerale-la-fausse-bonne-idee-du-gouvernement ) does n't reduce [ prison population . ] ( https://books.google.fr/books?id=7rvpg3f19cyc&amp;pg=pa37&amp;lpg=pa37&amp;dq=induced+demand+for+prisons&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ail22guhyy&amp;sig=a2bnbksb7y8-m0egbehtx-smacy&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewiqxervrnnrahwjcrqkhd2lbicq6aeinjad#v=onepage&amp;q=induced%20demand%20for%20prisons&amp;f=false ) . 
  judges will be more enclined to send people to jail . 
  welcome to the world of [ induced demand ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/induced_demand ) . 
   converting old military garrisons into detention centers , like someone from the opposition proposed ? 
  how about letting people serve their sentence at home , electronic bracelets etc. 
   you know from where manel valls is from , right ? 
  goddamit you 're right . 
  the guy has a screw loose , he ca n't keep his temper : o we 'll send in the breton nationalists to [ control him ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5mcca7owom&amp;t=47s ), 
  oh boy , i have the impression you wan na invade france . 
  luckly the train 's slow . 
   we 'll invite people from perpiny\u00e0 man all 3 catalans ? 
  so it 's gon na be wild : o, 
   these countries are usually with powerful and corrupt central governments and civil liberties are often ignored . 
  i 'd advice you to go visit some . 
  uruguay is more advanced than any eastern european country . 
  chile is quite a stable country and argentina used to do quite well and they will . 
  claiming that their people do n't value these `` western values '' is absolutely ridiculous . 
  get off your high horse , estonian . 
   keep going , afd , maybe your result in september becomes single-digit as more people wake up to what you really are . 
  please staaahp . 
  that 's what will make them elected and become the new chancellors of the universe . 
   the fact that in this case it 's for foreigners and in a foreign country [ yeah !, 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/statue_of_liberty ), 
  hey . 
  if you get a nice party and some pop-corn moments , all 's good . 
   outside the western world these ideals and morals have no value . 
  yeah south american countries and eastern europe could n't give a shit for those . 
   here in catalonia our referendum is scheduled for 2017 i think we 're talking about real refs here . 
   i 'm wondering if the people , who accuse le pen of being a pawn of moscow claim the same thing about fillon now too . 
  during the french debates he constantly got accused of being putin friendly ... 
   macron - charismatic upstart whose platform most closely aligns with most redditors ' views . 
  sanders sanders like macron  ) ) . 
  macron an upstart ... man thanks for the laugh . 
   this guy is not enough conservative to be compared to fillon . 
  http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/local/2016/12/13/john-kasich-acts-on-abortion-bills.html fillon has been a classical french right winger concerning abortion ... meaning a center politician in the us . 
  kasich is in favor of the death penatly http://www.ontheissues.org/2016/john_kasich_crime.htm fillon voted to end it . 
  http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/histoire/peinedemort/scrutins.asp you clearly know extremely little on french politics . 
   if only the ecb had n't taken away that power from us with the euro we could have got over 2008 much faster as well * sigh * . 
  i 'm still hopeful in 2 years maybe ? 
   a person putting the good of the country before the ruling party . 
  he 's from the opposition of the ruling party . 
  think jospin/chirac . 
   and why minsk 1 was n't implemented ? 
  russia had n't finished conquering .

  they want to pursue their studies in english , but not in britain because the costs are too uncertain . 
  yes , that 's what i 've understood . 
  no central system so if your alarm or a neighbour 's goes off , you might take action , but there 's no generalised alert :-( those poor people ... 
  i think i subconsciously perceive them as adverts , so my eyes pass over them . 
  no that was an appropriate reference . 
  the prisoners ' dilemma is about cooperation versus defection . 
  your polity had an interest in long-term cooperation for mutual benefit thanks to your bizarre aquaphilic landscape . 
  there 's an aspect of the tragedy of the commons as well , but in this case it seems that cooperation was successful and tragedy averted . 
  well yeah , but successive uk govts relinquished more control than was necessary . 
  it 's convenient to blame europe , but your own leadership has had a huge role in this . 
  early reports suggesting there was no fire alarm , or at least it failed to go off . 
  horrifying for the residents and the people of london . 
  my thoughts are with them . 
  nope mate , i 'm rubber and you 're glue . 
  i heard you 've already started the practicals on your own . 
  or at least you tried , but were n't quite able to make it with your pet goat . 
  better luck in a few years . 
  enjoy middle school !, 
   when i debunked your bullshit examples you stopped arguing . 
  no that 's not what happened . 
  you engaged in hyperbole and personal attacks and i lost interest . 
  cheerio !, 
  okay thanks for the clarification . 
  you explained your entire argument in less than four minutes ? 
  lol . 
  we 're leaving in a few . 
  play at the kids ' school . 
  no , it 's a half hour later than i thought . 
  the uk is in the wto both as part of the eu and separately as the uk . 
  it wo n't need to renegotiate afaik . 
  in your math analogy , you 're killing 90 % not 2 % of the male population . 
  your argument rests on an assumption that men are inherently superior to women . 
  you claim there are boy jobs and girl jobs , \u00e0 la theresa may . 
  try explaining it to a close female relative and see how that goes . 
  did you say wiped out most , yes or no . 
  again , it should n't matter if there 's a biological difference between men and women . 
  if women 's biological urges are so strong as to deter them from a career in politics , we should n't expect more than the quota of women . 
  but in both cases we have more than the quota !, 
  how to explain it ? 
  your argument seems to have become : * men and women are biologically different , but women can override these biological differences if there is a quota in place . 
  * so your alleged biological imperatives are in fact * contingent imperatives * that are subject to the presence or absence of a quota system . 
  if a quota is in place , women can cast off the shackles of their gender and aspire to roles in the political system of the country . 
  in fact , you 're basically arguing in favour of quotas . 
  anyway , i 'm off now because i have an appointment . 
  cheers !, 
  firm , leather-clad grasp of the issues . 
   why do i need to contradict that data that agrees with me ? 
  you wrote that greater female participation is also due to the genocide that ** `` wiped out most of the male population '' . 
  ** the data show clearly that `` most of the male population '' is a wild overstatement . 
  the data does n't agree with you at all . 
  are you seriously saying that a 2 % difference in male/female population has a 30 % + effect on political participation rates ? 
   if you were n't dishonest you should have said `` oh by the way , they got a bunch of mandatory seats for women + a genocide that reduced the male population '' from the start instead of pretending that 's there are n't any details that might slightly skew the result . 
  keep telling yourself that . 
  the fact of the matter is that i tried to answer your request for clarification but you had already deleted the request in order to accuse me of dishonesty . 
  fuck that it 's bullshit . 
   lol , are you that sexist you think voters vote for their own sex ? 
    voters vote for who they think is best , not for their own sex . 
  this has to do with a bigger percentage of people wanting to join politics , not people voting . 
    do you seriously vote for candidates solely based on their sex ? 
  you 're tilting at windmills . 
  let 's clear this up for you . 
  you 've claimed that ** female participation is greater because there are more women than men ** . 
  i have given you data that show that the difference in number of women/number of men in the upper age cohorts is about 80k of a total population in those ages of around 7.5 million . 
  you 've said nothing to contradict these data . 
  these data refute your claim `` wiped out the male population '' . 
  i chose these age cohorts not * because of the way they vote * , but to represent likelihood of choosing politics as a career . 
  that 's because people under 16 are unlikely to run for parliament . 
   considering how blatantly dishonest you were about rwanda my guess is i wo n't be surprised with the results . 
  i was n't dishonest . 
  you asked for clarification and i tried to provide it , but ** you had already deleted your comment ** . 
  you can stop the personal attacks and try to defend your initial claim with logic and reason . 
  if women are biologically different and therefore less likely to pursue a career in politics : 1 . 
  the logical conclusion is that women in rwanda are biologically different from other women . 
  just because there 's a 24/80 quota does n't explain why over 60 % of seats are filled by women . 
  there must be a biological explanation !, 
  we must assume that women in bolivia are also biologically different from other women . 
   if the eu is perfect for everyone nobody has ever said that , afaik . 
  most countries would say that eu advantages outweigh eu disadvantages . 
   wiped out most of the male population ? 
  okay , as you 're so insistent , let 's look at that one . 
  based on your biological argument , we should expect female participation to diminish as the effects of the genocide recede and the m/f proportion of the population rebalances . 
  but , as you 've no doubt read , female participation has been growing , yes ? 
  for good measure , let 's look at the assertion :  wiped out most of the male population ? 
  from [ indexmundi ] ( http://www.indexmundi.com/rwanda/age_structure.html ) : 15-24 years : 18.87 % ( male 1,226,141 / female 1,225,009 ) 25-54 years : 32.93 % ( male 2,142,936 / female 2,134,064 ) 55-64 years : 4.09 % ( male 249,447 / female 282,225 ) 65 years and over : 2.58 % ( male 138,834 / female 195,831 ) ( 2016 est. ), 
  where 's the massive difference between men and women among the voting age population ? 
  i count about 80,000 difference ? 
  how is that wiped out ? 
  now , what have you learned about bolivian women ? 
   i was waiting for you to reply , you did n't , so i deleted and resended it to alert you . 
  and then accused me of dishonesty . 
  yeah nice one . 
  either rwandan women have the same biological interests as other women , in which case it does n't matter what quotas are in place , we should n't expect much over the quota . 
  or your * biological argument * is garbage . 
   seriously ? 
  you 're going to be that dishonest so as to intentionally omit those critical details ? 
  fuck your accusations of dishonesty . 
  i was writing a reply when you deleted your comment you sly cunt . 
  lol . 
  there are reserved seats in the parliament for women how many ? 
  and what proportion of seats go to women ?

  mixed with a sentiment of anti street food , and fast food in general . 
  but it 's complicated.in many regions , street food is deep in the culture , like [ in the north ] ( http://www.ouest-france.fr/sites/default/files/styles/image-640x360/public/2014/07/18/une-baraque-frites-sur-la-place-de-la-gare.jpg?itok=6eyh9nmx ) , [ or on coast tourist area ] ( http://images.sudouest.fr/2016/09/02/57e10da666a4bde778cff452/widescreen/1000x500/degustation-danguilles-a-la-persillade-lundi-dernier-au-port-de-by-a-begadan.jpg ), 
   after that , serbia paid kosovo 's debts until un sanctions were imposed on belgrade in 1992 . 
  it resumed paying the debts in 2001 . 
  i am not an expert , but you waste precious bullets paying that debt , if you want that territory back in your hands . 
  it 's a wonderful pressure tool against `` international community '' .

   but hours after the ambassador made his comments over the weekend , israel 's foreign ministry issued a `` clarification '' saying that soros was a legitimate target for criticism .

  or is it just a classical deny from a government : `` we can not confirm or denial the actions of mr x in that y area . '',

  it would make no sense to me to deny it . 
  that 's what i ask , because when you want to play this game , you 'll show them how silly it is . 
  is there a official list of genocide supported by this sub ? 
  because if you want to enforce a rule , it must be clear in the first place .

  i think that says a lot . 
  because context matters , context matters a lot . 
  where it is said , and by who , and at what time . 
  london , england , by the major , in a time where terrorist attack have taken place . 
  if he denounced both , it would suggests an equal menace of these groups , salafi and hezbollah . 
  it 's not even close , not by a major factor .

  see this in this way : as he was a fan of `` modern art '' it is justice his name is associated with something so ugly . 
   it 's not an official poster all right , make sense now . 
  it quite easy to differentiate . 
  far right have more taste in their clothing , sometimes done by designers or haute couture . 
  i read this is a 1959 standardization.the funny thing is the foot or any other measurement is base on metric system . 
  metric is based on itself as a reference . 
  the art may turn good or bad , a personal taste . 
  the sad thing is no technical prowess in it , nor in materials nor construction methods . 
  yes , it 's a big enhancement to the main building . 
  why english is in that poster ? 
  what foot ? 
  american or imperial ? 
  you see , even with bodysparts measurement , it can confuse people . 
  i was thinking the exact same thing . 
  a statue taller than see befor , especially with the new alloy of materials .

  great , a study about feelings . 
  let 's grab my fear-o-meter .

  in practice the americans had the total view over the project and architecture , and integration of the components . 
  the other partners developed parts and systems to be integrated by lockheed . 
  so yes , the work was shared in terms of money spent . 
  that 's mostly what the partner countries wanted , get some economic investment . 
  but in terms of knowledge and skill it is clearly an american aircraft . 
  when an air force has a technical in-service issue they call lockheed , not one of the partners . 
  [ correct ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/59/le_relais_du_miel_profiterolles.jpg/1280px-le_relais_du_miel_profiterolles.jpg ) stuffed in vanilla ice cream and covered with warm chocolate , with a side of chantilly , it 's delicious . 
  and light of course . 
  for the same reason the us does n't buy european military equipment , especially for combat ones . 
  it 's an area where countries want to rely as little as possible on others . 
  we do n't want to ask the us for authorisation when we decide of a military operation . 
  no in france we have desserts , not deserts . 
  yes , it 's 46c in c\u00f3rdoba for example today . 
  the only time i had to break a $ 500 bill the banks would n't take it . 
  but the supermarket did . 
  does n't change my point . 
  i did n't say you should n't care because it 's another country . 
  it 's a really stupid reason to hold a grudge against the people of france now , especially since all the recognition of mistake , apologies and reparations have been a long time ago already . 
  i mean , a lot of us were n't even born back then ffs . 
  do n't get surprised when people get angry if you keep putting on them mistakes that they have nothing to do with . 
  all big countries did some shit in their past , including australia . 
  and yet we do n't hold it against the current people . 
  if people here did n't use the occasion for spouting free insults at all the french people maybe they would n't get so riled up .

  at the same time i 'm basically in underwear at home in summer . 
  maybe a t-shirt if someone can see through the window , but definitely not covered in clothes . 
  i think what you find comfortable varies with the temperature outside . 
  for example in winter i would find 28c way too warm and uncomfortable . 
  because that 's too much of a gradient . 
  but when it 's 45c outside , 28c feel refreshing . 
  there are buildings that cool close to 20c but most people find them too cold , that 's too much difference with the outside . 
  even though the same people will find 20c perfect in winter . 
  because it 's 45 outside . 
  without air conditioning it 's unbearable . 
  but i find 28c the maximum limit of comfort inside , so i use that . 
   we have our thermostat set for 19.5 c ( northern england ) . 
  yes my heating is the same in winter , it 's only 28c for cold air . 
  yes , my ac is set at 28 in summer ...

   traditionally it was mandatory to put the father 's surname before the mother 's but nowadays the fathers can choose the order . 
  no i do n't mean the order , i mean which of te 2 do you choose ? 
  like your father 's last name is gonz\u00e1lez-mart\u00ednez . 
  your mother 's name is morcillo-perez . 
  what 's your last name ? 
  really ? 
  you ca n't be spanish just with one last name ? 
  i 've done my nie and taxes there without issue , is that different for the dni ? 
  i just find it strange when it 's the same name . 
  you might as well just put once . 
  how does it work when you have children ? 
  they choose one name from the father and one from the mother ? 
  how do they choose ? 
  also what i find strange is that most people have also 2 first names , like the parents could n't agree . 
  in practice everybody just uses one of their first names and one of their last ones , because otherwise it 's too long . 
  it happens to me every day that i can not find a colleague in the directories because they usually use their 2nd last name . 
  also several times we found out with other people that we are talking about the same person actually , but referring to them by different names . 
  you 're laughing but i know a few guys in spain with 2 times the same last name . 
  you 'd think they 'd put it just once but no . 
  what else do you propose realistically ? 
  they are linked with the railway itself . 
  so typically they do n't evolve on the same path . 
  when a new rail is built , it can be be designed for a slightly higher speed . 
  in record speed yes , but in commercial speed it 's very comparable . 
  right , we could make a camp to concentrate them . 
  so which country is going to accept to give citizenship without looking , and take a load of a few thousand people from various places , all very poor to gather into a slum ? 
  even if you found some place shit enough to accept that against a few millions , you 'd get blocked by your human rights obligations . 
  because we do n't know where they come from , so the only way to deport them is to pick somewhere anyway . 
  first , we do n't want to build and maintain huge prisons for them . 
  plus many would actually find it not so bad . 
  and you 'd have to deal with the accusations of making a concentration camp . 
  second , you ca n't imprison them indefinitely by law . 
  they need to be convicted of something by trial , and imprisoned for the duration of the verdict . 
  and other people are always the same full of `` do something ! '', 
  but never propose anything realistic . 
   if they do n't remember their country , you ask the african countries to see whose citizen it is . 
  `` hello , i 'd like to confirm whether a guy is from your shithole . 
  his name is mohammed and he 's black , between 25 and 40 . 
  yes i 'll wait . '', 
  they do n't . 
  they come , arrest who 's still there , and remove the block . 
  they were sent back for the few that could . 
  the rest stayed in europe , sent to various cities that could handle them . 
  i do n't know what the definitive solution is . 
  but it 's not to put the region under martial law , arrest them all on sight and finance huge prisons .

  `` when paris sneezes , all europe catches a cold '' ~ metternich, 
  and a lot of them from the french media , which was pretty shameful . 
  even during the battle of france in 1940 , there were ( iirc ) 360 000 dead and wounded . 
  it 's not like the whole army surrendered after 2 days or shit . 
  it never bothers me when its on stuff like polandball or when it 's obvious it 's a joke . 
  but after that whole iraq war business , the anglo-americans reaaaally went overboard with it . 
    paris , the romantic city of love / / paris the festering islamist hellhole . 
   do you mean both are untrue ? 
  yep . 
  too many people idealise paris after seeing am\u00e9lie poulain or some shit , and then start bitching when they realise it 's also a metropolis of +2 million people ( 10 million if you count the whole urban area ) , with its own problems as every city . 
  and for the islamist hellhole thing , kinda goes without saying . 
  surrendering . 
  eating snails and frogs all the time . 
  paris , the romantic city of love / / paris the festering islamist hellhole . 
  ffs , will they never get over it ? 
  yeah , it 's not like a guy called george w. bush called a great crusade or anything . 
  i 'm a fairly left-wing person and i get extremely irritated at the french pc brigades , but the anglo-saxons are just insane . 
  even the `` survivor 's issue '' was branded as racist by these maniacs . 
  i 'm not a big fan of ch , not that i find them bad or anything , just very tame in my view . 
  but seeing the rest of the world getting butthurt every time one of their drawings gets media attention is priceless . 
  one for france : * [ the battle of verdun ] ( http://p4.storage.canalblog.com/44/65/1042402/83985625_o.jpg ) the longest battle in wwi ( it lasted from february to december 1916 ) . 
  the german army launched an assault on the fortified town of verdun , nearly broke through , were stopped by desperate french resistance . 
  then the french army counterattacked and were bogged down . 
  the total casualties range from 700 000 to 1 million men . 
  final result ?

  this . 
  i was shocked by how poor the rest of england ( have n't been to scotland , wales or n. ireland so ca n't tell ) seemed compared to london . 
  it 's like the divide between paris and the rest of france on steroids .

  one of tf1 's execs said publicly some time back that tf1 's job was to create `` available brain time '' for coca-cola .

  other channels are of the same level . 
  then you have the real idiocracy-tier channels like d8 and nrj12 . 
  public tv ( france 2 and especially lcp , but no-one watches lcp ) is somewhat better , especially their investigative programmes . 
  canal + used to be great , even a little subversive , with the brilliant guignols de l'info ( think spitting image with much darker humour ) and such , but over the years has become a shallow , mainstream , vaguely left-wing channel .

  seems to me like a vast improvement on mad corbyn and blairite robots burnham/cooper/kendall . 
  eh , renan is n't some `` random fucking author '' , his thoughts on the matter are the basis on france 's approach to nationality . 
  you 're free to your own understanding of it , it 's just not what the french mainstream has been for a century now . 
  just wanted to clear that up . 
  edit : did n't see the question . 
  when do you become french ? 
  i 'm a pretty old school republican , so my answer is that you become french when 1 ) you are legally french 2 ) you speak the language and share french values 3 ) you `` feel '' french and not anything else , and are willing to participate in the common destiny of the nation . 
  i 'm going to go full sherlock here and guess you do n't agree , which is fine , not that i care much . 
  also pretty much everybody in france would disagree with you , even marine le pen . 
  this should help : http://ucparis.fr/files/9313/6549/9943/what_is_a_nation.pdf, 
  to be fair , this was a pre-algerian independence statement , when some people were floating around the idea of equal rights for algerians . 
  in reality , there were large immigration waves in the 1960s ( the largest immigration wave in french history was in 1962 , i believe ) . 
  you do realise that marine le pen has brought the fn to unprecedented levels of electoral success ( bringing in its first mps since the 1980s * , even some senators , more mayors than ever , breaking the 20 % barrier ) and has attracted tons of new support ( the youth used to hate the fn ; now young people 's top party is the fn ; similarly with women ) ? 
  also nobody really cares about dieudonn\u00e9 in the general population . 
  * the 1980 's do n't count as much because mitterrand specifically implemented proportional representation to bring in as many fn mps as he could to split the right-wing, 
  in the french republican conception of citizenship , the republic is `` one and undivided '' : there can be no distinction based on race , gender or colour . 
  the citizen is to be considered only on the basis of his belonging to the national political community , not his origins or anything else . 
  this is why `` ethnic statistics '' have always been forbidden , why affirmative action based on race is an extremely hot issue ( and only really exists for women in the political sphere ) . 
  the constitutional council some years back censored a law that referred to `` the corsican people '' , stating that there was no such thing as a `` corsican people '' only a `` french people '' . 
  in the same way , the court said that there are no `` fran\u00e7ais de souche '' , only french citizens . 
  hi and thank you for this ama . 
  * the european parliament is often criticised for being powerless , or only being able to amend texts on purely technical points . 
  we also saw during the last european elections that angela merkel and others said that the results would not dictate their choice for the eu commission president . 
  so my question is , what do you think , as an mep , blocks the parliament from being a real , democratic assembly of the european people , and what can be done to change it ? 
  * quite often when debating with eurosceptics , i find that i do n't really have any good arguments pointing to good things the eu has done , apart from erasmus . 
  as you will be a key figure in the referendum debate in the uk , what main arguments are you planning to use ? 
  * marielle de sarnez ( i suppose you know her ) stated that she believed in * l'europe en cercles concentriques * , with different rules for different blocs in the eu . 
  is n't this a dangerous and divisive idea , especially for eastern european member states ? 
  anyways , thanks again !, 
  eh , the mongols were big on promoting religious freedom , were n't they ? 
  as i said : i guess the reasoning behind the questions is to find very basic awareness instead of in-depth knownledge , the assumption being that if somebody ca n't answer those questions , there 's a big chance they 're not that aware of the eu 's workings . 
  i myself do n't agree too much with this assumption , though . 
  is the election of the european parliament a pointless fact ? 
  also , on what grounds can you say that certain countries are just `` irrelevant '' ? 
  also i do n't put any particular value on these facts , just that i thought that european elections and switzerland not being in the eu was common knowledge . 
   who gives a shit about such completely irrelevant questions ? 
  the election of the european parliament is n't really irrelevant . 
  unless of course you 're in the `` oh , politics change nothing , i 'm too cool for that '' category . 
   do you know how many synaptic connections there are between the mechanical sensors in your finger tips and your neocortex ?

  socialist , left to far-left . 
  - ps : parti socialiste , was in power for the last 5 years . 
  social-democratic , left . 
  it used to be this way , but extreme instability changed our opinion on that . 
  i think that goes without saying for the audience of r/europe . 
  for those curious : he used to be a mayor and a mp , and is otherwise totally unknown . 
  long-time support of moderate republican primary candidate alain jupp\u00e9 . 
  he 's totally unknown . 
  you 'll enjoy the southwest, 
  c\u00f4te d'azur is nice if you 're looking for tanned grannies, 
  depends what you 're looking for . 
  nice try , chinese tourist !, 
  trying to ruin the best spots for us french citizens !, 
  more seriously , anything outside of paris is fine . 
  strasbourg , bordeaux , tours are smaller cities surrounded by historical good stuff . 
  honestly that two to three people a year . 
  the fact that so many people quote it on reddit is unbelievable . 
  i think they would enjoy more the trip if they went to different places . 
  flair checks out, 
  honestly if you 're just too desperate , too ugly , too lazy or too uninteresting to go pick 'em by yourself it just gives off a bad vibe . 
  there is a difference in style , too . 
  a charming womanizer with some * lettres * and the ability to laugh it off looks better than a man who behaves like a pig and regularly hires prostitutes . 
  paris . 
  chinese people are everywhere here . 
  everywhere . 
  to be more precise : the louvre , the ch\u00e2teau de versailles , the eiffel tower . 
  the integration of foreign cultures is called assimilation , not multiculturalism . 
  multiculturalism , on the other hand , has indeed failed . 
  i would call multiculturalism a symptom of the failure of integration policies rather than a policy in itself . 
  dass what the youngsters all say, 
  to the eu, 
  i wonder why people make such a big deal of him being a former banker . 
  because he used to be a banker , does he have no soul , nor feelings for the poorer ? 
  does he drink their tears out of a baccarat glass ? 
  not saying he cares more or less than the others , i have no idea about that . 
  but saying he cares less because he used to be a banker is such bullshit . 
  high quality shitpost, 
  doing well . 
  could be doing better . 
  that 's what we have to see here . 
  thus far trump has proven to be a terrible leader , worse than xi or orban . 
  the only reason why the us are n't on fire right now is because the us are a powerful rich country to begin with , and the administration actually employs talented people . 
  the speech opened with the ode to joy and ended with the marseillaise . 
  the speech opened with the ode to joy and ended with the marseillaise . 
  do n't be like that . 
  even if it was a loaded question it deserved a honest answer . 
  he is n't officially declared the winner , that wo n't be the case until thursday i think . 
  all we have are very precise estimations from the ballots that have already been counted . 
  you 're actually kinda wrong . 
  it 's a popular theory in french political science that the president is a `` republican monarch '' . 
  just a joke, 
   europe day   vichy :(, 
  we wo n't `` stand up '' to germany . 
  we work with them . 
  most french people :  varou who ? 
  most of those vote macron . 
  oh boy , for a language so comfortably set in its status as a global franca people here sure look pissed !, 
  simple . 
  - locals know the issues and the failures . 
  they live to tell whether the policies were good or not . 
  foreigners do n't , all they see is headlines and pics . 
  - obama is a charismatic man who led an amazing pr campaign . 
  - in comparison to the republicans ( who represent a branch of politics that does n't exist in france , where statism is the norm ) , he looks like an obvious choice . 
  - there is no one to criticize him because we do n't pay enough attention to him . 
  no breitbart , right-wing media that would focus on him . 
  if he does that i wo n't regret having voted for him . 
  yeah , i agree with you there . 
  it 's extremely easy to think this or that person would be elected when you take the election in a vacuum , outside of all the other influences . 
  who really thinks obama supporting the remain side did play a role in brexit ? 
  obama is extremely popular in france ( back in 2008 if he 'd been elected by the french people again mccain he 'd have gotten 90 % of the vote ) . 
  this wo n't change anything in this campaign but it 's very nice to hear him praising macron . 
  1453 worst year of life give back hagia sophia, 
  on which points ? 
  she permanently attacked him on his past experience as minister of the economy ( which was irrelevant most of the time ) , barely mentioned her own platform and in the end looked hysterical by interrupting and insulting him even though they were supposed to let each other conclude . 
  honestly just watch the whole thing . 
  whether macron was good or not is up for debate , but there is no denying her performance tonight was a phenomenal disaster . 
   divided ideologically at a point that none of the main group speak to each other ? 
  what are you talking about ? 
  joy joy, 
  i think it came from a latin pun , gallum meaning both rooster and the gauls . 
  your choice of words is poor , but you are correct in saying that france is more left-wing than some other countries , the first coming to mind being the us . 
  after all , the french communist party made remarkable scores up to the 80 's , when fran\u00e7ois mitterrand successfully shifted the politics of the left in france . 
  it still has some local strength , even though it has been declining for decades now and is under pressure from france insoumise , m\u00e9lenchon 's left-wing movement that would be called communist in the us but is far , very far from it actually . 
  i would say that it is not france that is exceptional , but rather the us , which have gone trough the industrial revolution and the growth of a proletarian class without a successful communist party taking roots . 
  it has to do with acts of violence and terror from the higher spheres of power and a different kind of political culture , that may be less favorable to the rise of communism . 
  then came the cold war , and communism became extremely unfashionable in the us for political reasons ( read red terror here ) . 
  when this was over , the gulag 's archipelago had been published and the most communist democratic nations , such as france , had appreciated the reality of communism under stalin , giving it a negative aura that still sticks with it to this day , the reason why far-left parties tend to do poorly when compared to their highest point . 
  as to the image of bankers , yes , they do not enjoy a very good reputation here , but this has more to do with a complex relationship with money in our culture , where it is less shown or even hidden ; we also share a cultural emphasis on equality that may explain some things , but as always there are movements , counter-movements and all . 
  this is a complex matter . 
  because it 's fat , it 's thick , it 's salty or too sweet , and i have nutella if need be . 
  i do believe you on that . 
  but see , that required you having lived in both places , which is the reason why it 's so hard to have an educated guess on these subjects most of the time . 
  never been there , i should trust you on that maybe . 
  i mean , i understand how thin the limit is between real cultural differences and baseless stereotypes .

  of course my opinion might be biased because i 'm not voting for him , if you want maybe more positive opinions of him you can ask / r/france edit : between m\u00e9lenchon and macron , macron would probably win . 
  why ? 
  and do you think it might really change ? 
  i do n't know , it seems to work in the gop 's favor so i do n't see them accepting any kind of change . 
  looks like the dems are the ones always getting screwed with that system . 
  what about it ? 
  could happen but it 's not the most realistic scenario but who knows . 
  it 's between mlp , macron , fillon and m\u00e9lenchon . 
  any one of them can make it to the second round . 
  the french system is very different from your electoral college mess though . 
  if every vote had counted dt would n't have been elected . 
  yeah she 's kind of a french dt , but in her defence ( ew ) she 's still not as dumb as him . 
  there 's very little chance that she 's gon na be elected though . 
  second round , yeah probably but winning ? 
  very long shot . 
  i think way more europeans travel outside of europe compared to americans traveling out of the us . 
  for one thing , most of us europeans want to see the new world ( usa ) . 
  there 's also a lot of europeans going to asia and africa for vacation . 
  what do you want to know ? 
  it would be even more humiliating . 
  plus some of the ministers still support him ( not a lot but some ) . 
  so no i do n't see it happening . 
   i sometimes like to entertain the idea of mlp not being at second round . 
  she has been losing traction lately and we could have a surprise . 
  i would just love to see her face if she does not make it to second round after everyone pretty much assumed that she would be there for months . 
  yes i have been fantasizing about that scenario too . 
  i agree that it 's not out of the question . 
  m\u00e9lenchon / macron would be fun . 
  yep, 
  i second italians/romans . 
  really awful experience there driving-wise . 
  and i 'm from paris . 
  it 's just another level there . 
  i do n't know where you are from . 
  i 'm guessing only french and german people know of him , 
  i only know of daniel cohn bendit , he 's a franco-german green politic . 
  he had a long and successful career in both germany and france ( got elected in both countries ) but not at the same time . 
  he was a member of the european parliament for the german greens and then for the french greens . 
  i know it does n't really answer the question , my guess is that it 's not possible , you probably have to chose a mandate and i also do n't think the general public would find it appropriate . 
  yes he can burn out , as i said nothing is certain and the 4 candidates i talked about can all be in the second round . 
  keep your money . 
  because hamon is really low ( 8 % from today 's poll ) so a lot of people that could have voted hamon are now gon na vote m\u00e9lenchon because they feel he might have a better chance . 
  also he speaks really well and is very educated/funny . 
  his campaign is really well made . 
  poor hamon on the other hand struggled from the start with a lot of people leaving him for macron . 
  mlp is far from being my favorite  . 
  i 'd say mlp/macron and macron winning but it 's more wishful thinking than anything . 
  we ca n't know . 
  4 of them are really close ( mlp , macron , fillon , m\u00e9lenchon ) so it 's impossible to say . 
  the consensus is that mlp is gon na make it to the second round . 
  she loses no matter who she faces . 
  ( according to the polls and that 's what i think too ) ps : sorry for answering even though i 'm not a boy . 
  one of my grand-mother had to flee paris because they had no food , she saw people getting shot when she was a child while on the road . 
  i have never heard her say anything really that bad about the germans , only small jokes and references here and there . 
  another grand-father i remember him complaining also about how hungry he was and how he had wished he could have joined the war ( he was a child too at the time ) . 
  for my other set of grand-parents , wwi impacted them more , my grand-father lost his dad in wwi but i do n't remember any conversations about it i was too young . 
  i 'd say old people do n't have that bad of a resentment , they know germans living now are n't responsible . 
  ( i ca n't speak for french-jewish families though ) . 
  it 's more of a `` forgive but not forget '' type of things for everyone old and young . 
  probably in the same way that french and spanish are taught in the us . 
  you have to pick a language and learn it but it does n't mean you 're gon na be good at it or even listen in class . 
  so yes english is taught to pretty much everyone now i think but it does n't mean most french people know how to speak it ( far from it ) . 
  it seems to me that the younger generation is doing a little bit better but still not good at all compared to some other european countries . 
  i see . 
  an easier solution would be to bring a laptop and just look for free streams . 
  i do n't think you 'll be able to find your games in bars . 
  enjoy your trip . 
  would n't that be in the middle of the night for us ? 
  ( sorry i do n't know anything about nba ) . 
  ooh yes !, 
  i think it does fit his question , it 's kind of like a reenactement theme park . 
  i really do n't know anything about that kind of thing . 
  but attacking nk seems like a very risky and selfish move even if you think the us can stop them . 
  you 're right maybe i should have worded all this better , it 's just the two cities that immediately came to my mind . 
  they can already nuke seoul and tokyo , they have nuclear weapons . 
  what they ca n't do is nuke the us because it 's too far and their nukes are n't that good apparently . 
  ( from what i remember hearing on tv with people that seemed like they knew what they were talking about ) . 
  so the us attacking would be very selfish if you ask me . 
  no i would be very nervous for south korea and japan . 
  tokyo ( pop 14 millions ) and seoul ( pop 10 millions ) are very close and i really fear what would happen to the people living there if the us were to attack nk . 
  where i live there 's a lot of [ roman empire reenactement ] ( https://www.francebleu.fr/s3/cruiser-production/2016/04/c8686d23-f3ef-4276-b657-f5c4841df123/870x489_jzeux_romains.jpg ) ( gladiator fights , roman army that kind of thing ) during the summer . 
  concerning the whole country , i know they did [ verdun ] ( http://www.il-y-a-100-ans.fr/sites/default/files/imagecache/grandeguerre_alaune_large/articles/ophotos/2016/05/28/348690677_b978788597z.1_20160528190201_000_gej6suj10.2-0.jpg ) ( wwi ) this february ( both [ german and french ] ( http://www.il-y-a-100-ans.fr/sites/default/files/imagecache/grandeguerre_alaune_large/articles/ophotos/2016/05/28/1822378371_b978788597z.1_20160528190201_000_gd86stcnb.2-0.jpg ) people in costumes ) . 
  but without the fighting . 
  and i know people did the austerlitz battle not long ago ( when napol\u00e9on beat russia and austria 's armies ) . 
  people from 12 different countries came to do the reenactement . 
  there 's a [ video ] ( http://www.24heures.ch/monde/bataille-austerlitz-reconstituee-costumes/story/23062293 ) if you 're interested there 's also medieval festivals where people come in medieval armors , with horses and lances and do medieval duels on horses , and other people dressing as peasants or merchants etc, 
  are n't you the one who brought up that restaurant review when it had nothing to do with the conversation ? 
  i do n't know what answer you expected when you start with `` the state of croissants in paris has declined rapidly in recent years '' . 
  it 's so over the top that when it comes from an american that probably never even tasted one i 'm of course inclined to defend them . 
  where in my post did i blame the guardian or talk about conspiracy ? 
  if you do n't know how notoriously anti-french some of the english press can be then i do n't know what to tell you . 
  if it pleases you to believe that french food is awful go ahead . 
  even an industrially made french croissant is probably a million times better than a home made american one so it 's all good . 
  oh i had no doubt that you could find anglophone sources saying how france is in decline and even the croissants are now shitty . 
  that 's not a surprise , friend . 
  and yes that le cinq review made the rounds in the french press also . 
  as you can imagine we were n't happy about it . 
  what a dramatic statement , do you work for fox news ? 
  i have no idea what you are talking about . 
  if people notice a croissant is not `` home-made '' they just have to walk 5 mins and go to another bakery .

  what we know though is that the medef ( representant of companies and ceo 's ) has no problem with taking money and giving nothing back . 
  recently hollande made an agreement with them stating that the state will give 1 billion euros to make it easier for companies and in return they would create 1 million jobs . 
  guess what , our money is gone but we still wait for those jobs . 
  i do n't really know . 
  i hesitate between voting for melenchon and not voting at all . 
  this presidential campaign is basically fucked up . 
  le pen is almost assured of reaching the second round and i 'd hate to choose between her and macron or hamon , fillon or whoever the right sends . 
  whoever wins it 's still going to be mainly the same policy . 
  liberalism and submission to whatever the european commission says . 
  i do n't want to choose between a liberal and a national-liberal . 
  m\u00e9lenchon is really good but he will never win because they media has already chosen who must win . 
  the storyline opposing macron and le pen is told by the media since 6 month now . 
  same problem here with the parti socialiste . 
  i was `` supporting '' ( not really since i was a teenager ) the party during the sarkozy era , but as soon as they reached the elys\u00e9e , i was disappointed with their policy . 
  they went from being social democrats ( which i used to agree with since i 'm a leftist but not supporting the idea of revolution ) to being social liberals under the control of macron and valls . 
  now i can say i will never vote for them again . 
  fuck these guys . 
  the only thing they did a rightwing gov would n't have done is gay marriage , for the rest it was basically the same . 
  pasta con tonno is one of my favorite dish to make . 
  so simple yet so good . 
  here 's my [ favorite song ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ookgv44mmd4 ) from your country, 
  i use kayak.fr but it is a french website , do n't know if they are translated . 
  if you want something else you should probably go on cheap companies websites like transavia or ryan air . 
  and if you happen to say `` chips at the same time , you have to add `` patate , chaussette '', 
  not that bad actually but comparing it to the nba is like day and night . 
  one of the reason why i want to go study in the us is so i can finally watch basketball at correct hours . 
  nobody goes there , except if you live there . 
  there 's absolutely nothing except big buildings full of the poorest people . 
  yeah i heard about that . 
  that 's sevran , seine saint-denis . 
  probably one of the worst neighbourhoods in the country . 
  if you know about french rap scene , a lot of stars actually come from sevran like serge aurier , kaaris or teddy tamgho . 
  it is known for its criminality and yeah , i guess that men are usually the only one going out so they do n't consider it as normal when a woman goes to the caf\u00e9 . 
  the intimidation is not tolerable and awareness was raised by the document you linked , everybody talked about it for a few weeks . 
  why should it be ? 
  collaboration mostly and us taking part in the holocaust . 
  i 'd say the darkest part of it was the vel d'hiv ( short for v\u00e9lodrome d'hiver ) where the nazis asked us to give all the male jews and we also delivered the women and children . 
  another filthy part of our story was colonization of africa and the independance war with algeria . 
  there was a group called organisation de l'arm\u00e9e secr\u00e8te ( oas ) which was specialized in torture and a lot of those who composed the oas later became politicians here . 
  well , it was the middle ages , every country used to slaughter a lot of its people back then . 
  especially because the dominant class was still looking for ways to maintain its power over the proletariat . 
  i do n't know about other countries , but yes , if the strict term of `` no go zones '' is somewhere you do n't want to go to/will never go to , yes obviously there are . 
  but it is not about the religion or about migrants . 
  in my city we 've always had zones you would avoid because they 're a bit dangerous at night . 
  the gypsy presence has been quite strong since they fled barcelona in the medieval era and the poverty they have to go through ever since puts them into drugs and crime so their neighbourhoods are shitty places you would n't go to intentionally . 
  that 's kinda the same for algerian/maghrebi neighbourhoods , even though they 're mostly nice people some of them are alcoholics or drug addicts or criminals and are a bit aggressive . 
  so yes , i guess there are no go zones , but as far as i know america also does have no go zones , try to go to the bronx at night or chicago south side , crenshaw compton etc. ... 
  wow , i heard about that taxation system here it 's called `` imp\u00f4t \u00e0 la source '' and it was a proposition made by the actual president , but he did n't establish it . 
  the id part is ridiculous . 
  in theory you must carry your id with you but in fact , unless you 're from a visible minority you will almost never get controlled . 
  i 'm a 21 yo white male , police never asked me for my id . 
   not having to think about insurance , taxes , i.d and bureaucratic paperwork . 
  you have none of these in the uk ? 
  really ? 
  most of us learn it at school so i 'd say 99 % of the people know it . 
  however , we only sing/know the first parts of it since it 's pretty long , noone sings the rest nor did they hear it . 
  why ? 
  in france the pirate party is quite marginal , i think it has some seats in city councils maybe in regional and departemental councils but no seats in parliament . 
  they have a good twitter account which i follow even though i do not vote for them . 
  i quite support the same ideas as theirs but i do n't think they would have a chance to do anything anyway . 
  iirc brescia also does have a team on the last rugby game on ps2 called `` rugby 08 '' . 
  probably the main reason i know this city !, 
  a city a few kilometers away from where i live is famously known in europe for being a huge center for prostitution . 
  the city is called la jonquera and if you were to ask me where to go to find prostitutes if you are in the south of france/spain i 'd tell you to go there so would anyone do . 
  about half the teenagers admit they have smoked weed , hence know the effects of it and know it 's clearly not as bad as adults think it is . 
  but adults still think that marijuana is so dangerous that it has the effects of crystal meth and therefore should still be banned . 
  my grandma on the other hand told me all my life to not smoke cigarettes and not drink alcohol . 
  my grandma even though she 's what you could call a socdem is still really old fashioned ( sometimes she drops racist slurs out of nowhere ) and she 's probably more conservative than anyone on the political spectrum in fact . 
  my mother is rather progressive , she tries to understand different points of view and opinions but she 's still left leaning in modern terms . 
  oh yeah , forgot about le canard . 
  good political satire comics too . 
  but yeah mediapart is kinda left leaning , even more when you 're reading their `` le club mediapart '' where basically any leftist can talk shit ( which i do n't really understand nor like ), 
  in france we have mediapart ( it 's our main source for political corruption news ) . 
  other than that , almost all of our newspapers/websites are owned by three big tycoons , sometimes in a consortium . 
   a large portion of the country ( or at least the majority in my region ) uses to talk about saint and gods using unkind words on daily basis . 
  i have an italian friend that hates when someone says `` porco dio '' do you think it is representative of a portion of italians ? 
  if yes , how big do you think that part is in the entire population, 
  space is our future so yes , it is obviously important . 
  however is n't the esa the first spatial agency in the world in terms of budget ? 
   volkswagens are seen as nice cars in the usa but extremely unreliable and until very recently fords in the usa were seen as complete shit ( they have gotten much better recently , still would n't buy one though ) was n't it a common belief that any car that was n't made in the us not reliable until recently ? 
  for the rest , yeah i 'd say that it depends on the model and the year . 
  for example i have a friend who has a brand new volkswagen polo and it 's awesome and another friend who has an old ford which is shit . 
  well , as i said i wanted to make it simple to understand ahah . 
  he basically issued a law that said that good christians were n't authorized to talk about italian politics . 
  i 'm not going to go into the small details but . 
  italians are strongly catholics as a tradition ( yet it is seriously decreasing ) . 
  when italy reached independance and unification the pope was not supportive , he issued a lot of religion laws to prevent italians from creating a country and taking parts in the politics . 
  however , the relationship between the pope and italians are a bit ambiguous . 
  the pope is the one who protected rome from the bombings during wwii for example . 
  is it actually mandatory that every president meets the queen ? 
  last news i had of her was that she was sick . 
  yeah and just let putin invade the eastern part of europe . 
  i know what you mean and i understand your point . 
  but by no means it is a good idea to just ease the sanctions in order to have good relationships with russia . 
  we must not forget the annexion of crimea which is probably the most illegal thing a country could do . 
  not to mention that putin is actively financing political groups on the inside of europe in order to weaken it . 
  no seriously , i do n't want my country to have good relationship with putin . 
   i rather think that we might need to be a little bit nicer to russia so that they in turn also will be nicer to us . 
  do you have any clue on how international politics work ? 
   kevin , dylan and other english names : people whose parents named them after a soapy us tv show characters .

  well , technically , it 's all about the rights and duties of a citizen and his state . 
  i 'm not condoning conscription and all , just saying that that 's the justification . 
  well , my mother is american , my father french , so i have both citizenships . 
  however i 've always lived in france . 
  also , my step father is british , so england is perhaps the only country i regularly commuted to , to visit `` step-family '' . 
  i feel totally french , but also have a great sense of community with europe . 
  i feel we 're all part of a same family . 
  for now , i do feel closer to western europeans , but i 'm sure that in time i 'll feel the same with the eastern half of europe , especially those countries which are in the eu . 
  holy shit . 
  sorry , but that kind of makes me think of gags in dry humor films like airplane or naked gun . 
  crimean tatar autonomy within ukraine , at 12 % in 2011 , approximately the population of crimean tatars . 
  was there that significant a divide between tatars and the rest of the population in crimea ? 
  to be honest , i quite dislike this . 
  now maybe , the tatars think they did n't have it so bad under ukrainian rule ... 
  agreed . 
  beautiful song . 
  i regularly listen to the red army choir , and the songs are just great . 
  tallinn has more russians than estonians ? 
  that 's bad ... 
  anyway , a union is more likely with belarus . 
  there have been attempts in recent years . 
   reachieve oursleves as master of europ russia has never been master of europe though . 
  at best , russia has only reached second best . 
  number one `` masters of europe '' status has gone to britain , france , germany and the us at different periods in time . 
  but never to russia . 
  the only time when russia came close was at the end of ww2 + immediately after ww2 . 
  but the `` master of europe '' status at that time rather goes to the us , or to the us/britain-led alliance , since at the time , and then during the entire existence of the ussr , western europe was europe . 
  the heart and center of europe was western europe . 
  the ussr only accomplished to impoverish eastern europe and set it back even more than it already was in comparison to western europe . 
  thankfully , eastern europe , now free and allied with the west , has started developing again . 
  russia has belarus in its sphere of influence to show off . 
  the west has poland . 
  guess which country is doing better ? 
  russia 's attitude is a sad thing . 
  if russia were reasonable it would benefit russia . 
  now , unfortunately , russia is pushing itself in a corner , making every one of its neighbors , including china and other ex ussr nations , distrust it . 
  soon , russia will be alone . 
  it 's too bad because russia , after the fall of the ussr , could have been a friendly nation , which would have greatly helped its development . 
  also , one can be a friendly nation and still have its own foreign policy - russian leader needs to stop being so insane . 
  check out idbus , for a bus ride from amsterdam to paris ( takes 7 hours , but you can save time by taking a night bus , and sleep in the bus ) . 
  already i see for next week , the prices can drop very low . 
  i mean 19 euros per person low . 
  the usual price is around 50 euros per person ... 
  so hurry if you want to get the good deals . 
  then stay at a hostel in paris . 
  the usual prices for hostels are between 30 and 40 euros per person , per night . 
  some have promotions which can go as low as around 20 euros . 
  so with a 300 euro budget you could probably make it in paris for a couple days , if we assume you only use half in transportation and housing for a couple nights . 
  is n't at least france 's and the uk 's military spending , put together , superior to russia 's ? 
  not to mention perhaps we have more professional and technologically advanced armies ? 
  considering french and british military cooperation , that should do . 
  unfortunately though , we have nukes , and thus in a way it makes it unwise for us to fight the russians ... 
  from the article :  activists say that the latest polling shows that 65 per cent of voters in the veneto region , which includes historic cities such as treviso , vicenza and verona , are in favour of cutting ties with rome . 
  yes , we are pretty much fucked . 
  our bad !, 
  i can not guarantee anything with hollande as president . 
  rather * [ dr. strangelove ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=so8nqficzzg ) 2 *, 
  charmberlain 2.0 phoney war : extension pack !, 
  i 'm not saying i 'm fancy , but when i was an intern in paris i 'd wear a tie and all to work , and since i 'm blond and blue eyed i look like a good boy ... but i was an intern so i was paid shit , and could hardly afford paying monthly metro fees . 
  so for some months , i 'd jump over . 
  i figured that if i ever got caught once in a month , the fine would still be cheaper than paying for the entire month . 
  i almost got caught once . 
  i jumped over , and saw the people controlling passengers immediately after . 
  i just jumped back out and walked to the next station and paid for a daily ticket there . 
  i arrived late for work , but it was worth it . 
  i do n't like doing this , but i did n't have a choice considering my miserable intern pay . 
  yep , that 's the more complete , right answer . 
  the dense population is n't the only factor . 
  paris rarely reaches pollution levels this high . 
  but lately , exceptional climatic conditions have held the pollution over the paris basin for too long , causing this pollution crisis . 
  russia would not be able to invade all of the eu . 
  regardless of us assistance , all eu military budgets added together dwarf russia 's . 
  and britain 's and france 's budgets are each almost that of russia , not to mention they have nuclear deterrence . 
  they 're also technologically more advanced armies , and more professional , in general . 
  hence , more the reason to have light skin to absorb a maximum amount of vitamin . 
  what are we debating ? 
  i was sick once , and we prescribed some drug . 
  this was in the middle of the winter , and i spent most of my time indoors . 
  i got a sunburn , on my face and hands . 
  i did n't understand why . 
  i then read the undesirable effects of the medicine i was taking , and one of them was extreme sensitivity to uv lights . 
  the lights of my bedroom gave me a sunburn . 
  anyway , little light is still light , which your body can capt and use . 
  and regardless , when it 's very cold , there 's still a few hours of sunlight . . even in norway . 
  fox is independent from government bidding ( to a certain degree , not more than other us news agencies ... there are always negotiations and pressures between governments and press ) , and are not censored by the government ( auto-censored , sure , but not censored by the state , as long as they are n't saying anything illegal ) . 
  sure , but even so , it gets very cold , so we need to have lighter skin to absorb sun-light during those months when it 's cold . 
  false *, 
  yeah , politicians have no idea . 
  wrong . 
  some lizards are venomous . 
  yeah , and i did n't imply that . 
  pff , denmark never even came close . 
  [ however ... ] ( http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_oiahqmtg-du/s8mvmjoka1i/aaaaaaaad-i/v_aluiltedg/s1600/napoleon-bonaparte-history-in-pictures-napoelon-empire-map.jpg ), 
  what are you talking about ? 
  mormons have a high birth rate . 
  what does that have to do with them representing 4 % ? 
  i guess we like the fact that we can feed ourselves . 
  sure . 
  but the cap scandal is largely bullshit . 
  france still gives more to the eu than it gets back .

  of course germans love macron because he will do nothing to oppose the system they thrive in . 
  melenchon/lepen final duel , trust me on this . 
  am nationalistic-right , will vote for marine on sunday . 
  that said , i would vote for m\u00e9lenchon without hesitation if it came to him and macron/fillon . 
  m\u00e9lenchon cares for the french nation ( i just disagree with his social-chauvinism ) , macron/fillon are disgusting liberals that spit on the french nation . 
  so do lots of french politicians . 
  it 's a logical target as germany represents the eu and many french people are starting to hate the eu . 
  though i would say marine le pen is less about attacking germany & germans per se , than angela merkel as an individual part of the `` brussels clique '' . 
  but again attacking the germans in french anti-eu politics ( from the left to the right ) is kind of an easy and cheap way to gain points , so its inevitable ... you kind of see that phenomenon all over economies which are not so vibrant anymore with lots of unemployment . 
  my point of view also is that hatred is mostly created by government propaganda and most people whether in ww1 , ww2 , etc. . . did not really hate each other . 
  even today , many bullshit things are always amplified by the media which is probably the worst organisation in society . 
  i mean , maybe german media is less misleading . 
  but everytime there is a football game against germany in worldcup or eurocup , they really play up the chauvinism in french media . 
  i remember last time french media even brought back schumacher on tv and played clips where he was saying he did not regret his actions , etc. 
  kept talking about the 1982 game over and over like anybody in france still gave a shit about this ( nobody did ... but all the sudden started to again due to the media ) . 
  i am on the very right of politics and even i ca n't stand what i call `` little chauvinism '' . 
  it 's so dumb and stupid , it 's really appealing to the lowest denominator in society , and almost every society/country falls to it as its human nature somehow . 
  but i will say that i think germans overall are much less guilty of it than french or other nations ( ie : americans ) . 
  do n't get me wrong they still fall to it , but in a much softer way than we french do . 
  at the end of the day , treating another person not like his nationality but like a human , is amazing . 
  but so many people see nationality before they see the person . 
  p\u00e9tain would approve !, 
  in bavaria 8:15 beer is normal . 
  you obviously do n't seem to live near any us military bases in germany , where soldiers get regularely arrested for drunk sieg heiling , especially at oktoberfest , happens every year . 
  except unlike europeans/germans , the us soldiers get a slap on the wrist and never get charged . 
  that 's funny considering poland is practically an authoritarian system now . 
   if he imagined the american waddling around heil-hitler-ing random germans minding their own business . 
  i would legit laugh , not assault the guy . 
  also the fact the assaulter ran away from police , is not very good sign . 
  the wehrmacht is still highly respected amongst the bundeswehr . 
  from the officer level down to the individual soldier in the bundeswehr . 
  after all , the bundeswehr 's original officer corps was 100 % ex-wehrmacht , probably many with nazi sympathies . 
  i do n't blame the germans . 
  prussian military culture was brilliant , back to napoleonic times , and should not be condemned . 
  preussens gloria !, 
  at the same time , who is the criminal here ? 
  i would venture to say the assaulter will be jailed whilst you can not take as seriously a drunken man doing roman salutes , even in germany . 
  physical violence is illegal . 
  pure and simple . 
  does n't matter about the politics involved . 
  that assaulter should n't have assaulted a drunken man doing nazi salutes . 
  just like i would n't assault and beat to a pulp some drunken man in the german subway after oktoberfest , who is yelling `` your mommy is dumb '' or something . 
  that is assault . 
  but of course on reddit which is very left-wing , sometimes legal matters go out the window when right-wingers or anything resembling right wingers ( as in this case ) get assaulted/killed/etc . 
  what 's most incredible is comparing tolerance of a relationship with a asian or black person with that of a muslim . 
  people seem to be much more tolerant of an interracial relationship , but when it comes to muslims , there is resistance . 
  it 's not surprising in the least if you have basic knowledge of german history , social classes , how society works , etc. 
  these practices have been common in germany in various shapes or form for about 200 years , regardless of the regime involved . 
  it of course reached total height in nazi germany . 
  all of these reasons are precisely why corruption is likely to happen and so obvious . 
  business & government should be in theory separate . 
  however in germany , politicians and business executives regularely switch seats and give each other favourable policies . 
  it 's the worst level of corruption possible , and in some cases , like the vw emissions case , it probably indicates part of the german government is criminally liable . 
  but nothing will ever come out of this for obvious reasons . 
  they are impossible to attack unless by some international court of justice . 
  in germany there is wide collusion between the capitalist class and the political class . 
  this is especially true with major industrial groups , which are owned by the same landed-elite since the 19th century ( krupp , siemens , etc ) . 
  it is especially controversial when you examine cases like the volkswagen emissions case . 
  i had read an article on this , i believe in the ft aswell , and it was blatantly obvious that there were links to the german government , who is so intertwined with volkswagen that it could almost be called a government agency . 
  however , keep in mind numerous countries work in the same way . 
  japan for example and their zaibatsus . 
  korea and their chaebols . 
  even in the us there is strong collusion between big business and politics , particularely with the defense sector , the industrial sector , the finance sector , and now the technology sector . 
  the collusion is just more indirect than in ex-feudal countries like germany or japan , which have a long history of aristocratic control of sectors . 
  * mass immigration of unskilled , low iq , violent , un-integratable people , who also have high fertility rates , and who will try to replace european people . 
  * the religion of islam . 
  * the abuse of nature/resources through the market system currently in place in europe . 
  that 's on top of my head . 
  [ germany was allied with china shortly before ww2 , and then switched to support japan later on . 
  many nazis were against this though . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sino-german_cooperation_1926%e2%80%931941 ), 
  as if fascism and the right was the biggest danger to europe right now . 
   he slapped me across the face . 
  probably overkill . 
  lol tolerant germans . 
  in france if that happened they would be thrown out of the store lol . 
   the french refuse to accept that not everyone speaks or at least understands their language . 
  some german people speak outstanding french though . 
   looks like this tourist had no problems with racism and was pretty ignorant about the history of a country he visited as a tourist . 
  to me he sounds like a benign chinaman having a bit of fun , snapping a cool picture of the hitler salute in front of a major german landmark . 
  kind of like holding a baguette in front of the eiffel tower or something . 
  but this completely benign bullshit of course is no go in schizophrenic germany . 
  the moslems love force , and believe whoever has force is given this force by god ( allah ) , so he must be supported . 
  when hitler shook the ( mostly british ) world order , the muslim world saw it as an act of god . 
  in north africa , panzer columns were greeted by enthusiastic `` heil rommel '' . 
  this was also the beginning of the end of franco-british colonialism in the arab world , as the arabs thought the `` invincible french/british man '' was no longer supported by god . 
  napoleon is seen as a french hitler in great britain , whilst in france there is a common unspoken consensus that `` he was the greatest '' , even if officially french respect republicanism . 
  do n't forget the case of india where he is literally revered . 
  i think it has to do with the idea that he wanted to free india from the british . 
  please . 
  you 're meaning to tell me that there is no concern from the average buerger who has some migrant centre established on the way his children or grandchildren take to school ? 
  they are not all far right . 
  they are just hoping , whether they are cdu or spd voters , that there is some kind of sensible change in policy . 
  i am the same . 
  i would never vote afd because i think they are incompetent . 
  i would vote csu if i were german . 
  but i am 100 % conservative nationalist . 
  and i am sure some people at both the csu and spd share my feelings . 
  i still think there is the potential for crackdown by police , hence why i completely abstain from posting on facebook . 
  could be paranoid but better safe than sorry .

  he sees greeks as : * `` a lying devil '' * `` treacherous '' * `` lazy '' * life ends : `` in fraud '' . 
  yes , the main differences between germany 's army and the uk or france are the german 's reluctance to use its troops because of its history and the lack of any nuclear weapon . 
  the conventional armies of those countries are relatively close to one another . 
   an eu army would be very dangerous . 
  to be fair , an eu army would probably be more useless than dangerous . 
  we ca n't find a common ground on issues like taxes or migrants , so i do n't see how we could take decisions about an act of war ... 
  and belgium is n't a `` failed state '' either . 
  that 's the point . 
  can you provide any source of such bashing of belgium by france ? 
  for example , any official statement coming from french elected officials , such as this one by the prime minister of belgium bashing france ? 
  there are libraries in almost every city , even in those that have less than 4000 inhabitants . 
  the suburbs are n't that big either , you can go to museums and stuff by public transportation , through the route that people use everyday to go to work . 
  to put an extreme example : in lyon , the neighbourhood of * la guilloti\u00e8re * , where a heavy majority of immigrants live , notably from north africa and sub saharan countries , is exactly 15 minutes away by walk from the opera and the art museum of the city . 
  still , if you go to the opera , you wo n't see much people coming from that neighbourhood . 
  you 'll usually see mainly old white people , a few students , a few families coming obviously from relatively wealthy background , and an important group of asians . 
  access is only annoying if you live in the countryside . 
  habits are playing a huge role in that trend . 
  isis seems to prey , like every sect , on people who are weak at least temporarily : young teenage girls on the internet to marry their soon to be `` martyrs '' , people in prison , people who have issues with drugs etc. . . 
  if you feel that your life is insignificant , you might find daesh as an attractive option to find a meaning in your life . 
  the problem is that there are millions of people who can feel insignificant in our individualist societies , and if only a few hundred of them decide to go for daesh , they can cause a significant threat . 
  being integrated is a great way to live a meaningful life , but that 's not enough to live a meaningful life . 
  it looks like a mix between a sectarian movement and the trend of mass murderers that started in the us . 
  efficient social policies can help , but it wo n't solve everything sadly . 
  it seems that they come from several kind of backgrounds : from middle class people coming from the countryside to lower middle class or poor people from * banlieues * . 
  lots of them went to jail for petty crimes , which usually means that they are poor and poorly integrated , but not necessarily all of them . 
  you are right considering that they are n't in extreme poverty though : none of them was homeless obviously . 
  still , i do n't think that people who like to visit museums or listen to operas would admire a sect that likes to destroy priceless roman ruins . 
   i 'd say that access to high culture is a prerequisite of cultural integration granting access to high culture is great for several reasons . 
  the current policy to popularize such culture needs improvement though , as granting access does n't seem to be sufficient . 
  nevertheless , i do n't think that it has much to do with the general problem of integration , as millions of frenchmen or italians or whatever are fully integrated as nationals without bothering about classical culture . 
  by the way , classical culture is n't necessarily a great tool to fight radicalization . 
  for example , many members of the muslim brotherhood are bright and cultivated . 
  i wo n't say that they are terrorists , but they advocate radical religious ideas that are contradictory with most european values . 
  many intellectuals have always dived into radical and fanatical ideologies during the past . 
  olivier roy , a specialist of islam , wrote an interesting theory about what pushes the radicalization today . 
  according to him , it is not a phenomenon of radicalization of islam . 
  it is the ** islamization of the radicalization ** . 
  the jihadists today are n't usually people who were deeply muslim for years . 
  they are n't people who studied the theology either . 
  25 % of them are converted people that never suffered of prejudice against muslims , and were [ well integrated ] ( http://www.ladepeche.fr/article/2015/10/27/2205559-jihad-maxime-hauchard-itineraire-banal-francais-devenu-bourreau-syrie.html ) . 
  almost all of the jihadists were n't too much into islam before a radicalization that happened in a relative short time . 
  lots of them were petty criminals , some never did anything wrong before , and almost all of them were enjoying the typical life of a teenager : listening to music , partying , smoking and drinking etc. . . 
  they are newborn as jihadists , not radicalized prejudiced muslims . 
  if we were in the 1970s , the same kind of people probably would have been involved in left-wing terrorism , or in anarchist terrorism during the 19th century . 
  propaganda works if it is not perceived as propaganda , otherwise it 's patronizing and counterproductive . 
  for example , you go to the cinema to watch * stalingrad * as an action movie , and the propaganda operates subtly , and it just works . 
  there are movies that could do the same job against jihadists , such as * timbuktu * , which is subtle and measured . 
  teenagers who have seen it are usually very impressed by this . 
  you can also demonize your enemy through the news . 
  the problem is that isis is already being demonized by the news . 
  propaganda does n't work on people who are rejecting the establishment and society as a whole . 
  the problem of jihad is about a very small minority . 
  propaganda is a tool that can be used to influence the majority . 
  it does n't work on the most extreme elements that are threatening us today . 
  france 's annual budget for the ministry of culture is around 7 billions of euro . 
  most museums are free for young people ( under 26 yo ) , classical concerts , operas and libraries are either inexpensive or free for that category . 
  still , the young people that uses those are usually those coming from middle class and upper middle class with a strong emphasis on intellectual values . 
  the people who are mostly sensible to isis , usually from poorer background , mostly go to cinemas , watch tv and listen to pop music , and rarely uses the rest of the cultural offer . 
  why would that be different in italy ? 
  fun fact : sin\u00e9 , a cartoonist that was working for charlie hebdo , was fired in 2008 by the newspaper , because he was accused of antisemitism by his redactor in chief after drawing a cartoon joking about jean sarkozy , the son of the president , marrying the heir of the darty family ( who is jewish ) . 
  sin\u00e9 was prosecuted for antisemitism and acquitted . 
  charlie hebdo was ordered to pay 90 000 euros to sin\u00e9 because it did n't followed the rules according to which you can fire someone . 
   they totally ignore their own crimes in north and sub-saharan africa though the french colonial past is still a hot topic in france , but saying that is a straight lie . 
  examples : * 21 may 2001 : the french parliament voted a [ law ] ( http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichtexte.do?cidtexte=jorftext000000405369 ) that recognises the atlantic slave trade and slavery as a crime against humanity . 
  * 20 december 2012 : president hollande qualified the french colonial system as `` deeply unfair and brutal '' and acknowledged the sufferings of the algerian people , in a [ speech ] ( http://www.france24.com/fr/20121220-france-algerie-hollande-discours-parlement-passe-colonial-repentance-excuses-memoire-histoire ) given in the algerian parliament . 
  * 12 october 2012 : president hollande gave a speech in dakar in which he talked about the massacre of thiaroye , which was the killing of 35 african soldiers , as `` a share of shadow in our history '' . 
  he decided to give the archives to senegal to display them in their memorial museum . 
  and the list goes on . 
  imo , dieudonn\u00e9 went too far during the last years . 
   he once dressed as an orthodox jew on television to be fair , he was n't mocking `` orthodox jews '' , he was mocking [ israeli colonists ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2j7ijhxf8ie ) , and was attacked by jewish associations as if he was mocking the jews as a whole . 
  around the same time , he was also mocking islamist terrorists and racists , and he was n't attacked by the muslims or the traditional french people . 
  therefore , he came to the conclusion that jews are considered specifically in france by the establishment , and radicalized against them . 
  the sentence seems heavy . 
  nevertheless , dieudonn\u00e9 is n't really ostracized by society . 
  he 's ostracized by mainstream medias and the majority , but he still has a huge fan base and when he finds venues that accept his shows , he has a huge success . 
  a large part of his fan base follows him specifically because of his hate of jews , and tried to imitate him through the fad of the * quenelle * that dieudonn\u00e9 invented ( an arm movement illustrating an act of sodomy on jews and on the powerful people with a kind of sausage ) . 
  by the way , he was fined several times in france and tried to avoid paying those fines by hiding his revenues . 
  holocaust denial is an offence in france since the * loi gayssot * ( 1990 ) , which was judged compatible with the european convention for human rights . 
  the treaty 189 of the council of europe was also ratified by france in 2005 and say the same thing about opinions published on the internet . 
  it has been ratified by 38 countries , some with a few reserves . 
  dieudonn\u00e9 was only fined by french courts , and tried to avoid to pay that by hiding his revenues , but this time he is sentenced to jail by a belgian court . 
  i 've been to berlin , and some neighbourhoods looked almost identical to poor french banlieues of paris or lyon . 
  but you are probably right for bavaria that i ca n't judge myself . 
   keeping crosses in schools and including muslim kids in christian religious classes that wo n't happen in our secular public schools in france . 
  also , it is possibly easier to accommodate a muslim faith in a religious and christian but open to freedom of religion state , like catholic bavaria , than in a secular state which considers that religion should n't be a public part of the life in society . 
  actually , there are uranium mines in niger that are strategic for france , just next to mali . 
  thus , france wants to avoid the spread of the crisis to niger . 
  currently , there is n't any uranium mining in mali itself . 
  the french model is also semi successful , but if you do n't live there , you will only hear about the problems , not about the successes or the most common situations . 
  there are more than [ 700 ] ( http://www.ibtimes.com/isis-threatens-germany-islamic-state-jihadists-vow-attacks-european-soil-spilling-2041662 ) germans fighting in syria currently . 
  the success of * deutschland schafft sich ab * written by sarrazin , the rise of pegida and violences against refugees , the higher unemployment and poverty rates among the turkish minority , the fact that [ 62 % of them prefer social contacts only to fellow turks ] ( http://www.welt.de/politik/deutschland/article108659406/tuerkische-migranten-hoffen-auf-muslimische-mehrheit.html ) tend to say that the german model is n't that more successful . 
  the difference in terms of integration is probably more about the fact that the german economy is in a much better shape than the french or the british economies , with a smaller muslim minority , than caused by a clear superiority of its model . 
  they genuinely tried to do the right thing , which is kind of admirable . 
  sadly , they are getting overtaken by reality . 
  the eu is rich , and sweden and germany are especially rich , but you ca n't give too much , such as ensuring their living conditions in expensive cities like stockholm or munich , to too many people . 
  finally , they are closing the doors . 
  it would have been better to build shelter in refugee camps near the border of the eu for every refugees , than to do what we ( the eu , but mostly germany and sweden ) did : open the doors , let refugees run in , then close the door and leave the unlucky ones outside , whereas they still try to run in . 
  filling the eu quota is just the following of the same policy . 
  the cost of sustainment for those who are in are going to be a much heavier burden than how much the cost of helping everyone in camps would have been . 
  that would have been wiser and more charitable .

  3 ) even a meta-study , which the author says she has done ( informally , i guess , because according to her bio she 's a writer and not a research ) , is going to have its limitations . 
  i do n't dismiss her experiences with hormonal birth control or those of many other women . 
  even for myself i actively went non-hormonal for `` what the hell will this do to my body '' reasons . 
  science needs to understand women better , but for credibility , we humans all need to understand science better . 
  edit : moved a couple sentences for clarity . 
  thanks to the bbc for confirming i 'm not nuts . 
  i was standing at lille europe yesterday , nearly deaf from a sinus infection , and thought i heard `` sanglier ... traffic interrompu ... '' over the loudspeaker . 
  `` guys , '' i ask my friends , `` did they just say a train hit a pig . . ? '', 
  no one else had heard the announcement , leaving me convinced i was hallucinating , even when the screens updated with canceled ( brussels ) and delayed ( strasbourg , paris ) trains . 
  there need to be more comments about how awesome this area is . 
  i spent 10 days in lithuania , 5 of them on the spit , and would return in an instant . 
  beach , forest , and culture all in one place . 
  the bicycle paths are amazing and the beaches are actually beachy . 
  was totally worth the bus ride from vilnius . 
  fwiw , i went off-season ( late september ) and got to enjoy the capital days festival in vilnius and the post-peak-tourism peace before everything shut down for the fall . 
  a + + would go again . 
  thank you !, 
  you 've given me a new little travel plan . 
  my big disappointment in schengen has been that it meant no more stamps after entering the area . 
  i do like that the stamps have the method you came in on ( train , car ... 
  i have n't got a boat yet , and i 'm not sure a walking one exists ) . 
  ah , i think i could afford this visit !, 
  was this stamped in your passport ? 
  what 's the funky looking stamp above it ? 
  does n't this still cause ambiguity with the spicy kind of peppers , which also come in red , yellow and green ? 
  for the geography impaired , like me , that 's 23 km off the coast of portugal , 100km north of lisbon , 489 km west of madrid , and 1830 km west-southwest of the saletta epicenter in italy . 
   which is enough for me to call him an estonian i like your attitude  the video was great and i 'm happy it got linked . 
  so more than one king was a [ drag ] queen ? 
  as an aside , but to dispel this myth : most american internships are paid . 
  there are 6 criteria ( albeit somewhat vague ) that must be met for an internship to be unpaid * and * legal . 
  the industries you 're most likely to find unpaid internships are those which already have too much demand and not enough ( stable ? ), 
  work : architecture , design , publishing , movie/art , journalism and ngos . 
  there 's been a lot of crackdown on the abusive unpaid internships in recent years , despite the shitty economy . 
  surely you will die from sleeping with a fan on . 
  it 's a well-known fact . 
  that 's exactly the point . 
  i live in france . 
  these words are requirements for being polite in france . 
  in the us , you usually wo n't be considered impolite if you skip them . 
  paris is one of the first places people ( from all over the world ) want to travel to . 
  not everyone is experienced in the cultural things , though , and this leads to wrong impressions . 
  like this one . 
  anyway , are you in france , too ? 
  we should be picnicking now . 
   surely start with a `` excuse me , do you know ... ? '', 
  not usually , no ( i am american ) . 
  polite , sure , talkative , yes , but what 's with the extra words ? 
  like , why would i greet someone when i come into the store , either ? 
  i just want to buy my eiffel tower keychains and get out . 
  my theory is that these two differences are roots of the `` french are so rude '' stereotype . 
  may you have few exceptions in the future !, 
   without a greeting this is normal and accepted in the us . 
  approaching without a greeting is just not done in france , but people do n't know that . 
  the mcdonald 's thing , no excuse , unless she wants free wireless  i get the question about tap water from people from all over the world ( hosted lots of couchsurfers ) . 
  some of them ask because it 's not safe in their own countries .

  confirm japan , including the weird tradition of making reservations for kfc . 
  confirm south america ( at least peru ) , also from personal experience . 
  in peru , the christmas turkey is a relatively new thing . 
  most people do n't know how to cook turkeys and many do n't have ovens or big ovens . 
  so , you rent a spot in the bakery ovens . 
  the bakery does batch after batch of turkeys . 
  great !, 
  not really . 
  bakeries bake bread . 
  bakeries do not know how to cook turkeys either . 
  they come back dry on the outside and frozen in the middle . 
  lucky for one family , they had an american over christmas . 
  of course , americans eat lots of turkey , this one must know how to prepare turkey !, 
  cue my first turkey cooking experience . 
  thank you google , youtube , wikihow , and lifehacker . 
  you know what else they eat in peru over christmas ? 
  panettone . 
  panettone is given like the english give bad fruitcake : to clients , bosses , friends , everyone . 
  you give a guy a panettone , but he 'll probably be giving you one , also . 
  the turkey-family had a small business and had cartons of panettone in the garage to give their clients . 
  i smell panettone now , i get a little nauseous . 
  panettone makes great turkey stuffing . 
  we had leftovers . 
  wow , i came here to say `` maybe it 's because i grew up in the us , but seeing official armed patrols really does not help me feel safer '' . 
  to me , nothing says `` things are expected to go wrong '' more than having armed professionals around . 
  i pass through paris ' big metro station and train stations everyday . 
  i kinda get that . 
  now they are on the non-descript avenues near my workplace .

  walmart cheese incident : up to 20 % cellulose , which yes , comes from wood . 
  cellulose has a lot of cool applications . 
  meat : random animal parts if you get the kinds of meat that are not made from specific parts , e.g. 
  sausage , hot dog , ground beef . 
  i dare you to find a country that 's not true in for those products !, 
  soy , i can not speak of . 
  these things do happen ; in the case of the us they are not typical so they are in the news when they do happen . 
  i eat meat in the us . 
  i 'll pass on walmart cheese because i 'm a spoiled cheese-eater . 
  if you like trolling around for this kind of product recall , the fda publishes all recalls online .

  seems to be a major source of economic migrants , but politically it 's quite stable at the moment afaik . 
  at the very least , people should be processed at their point of entry to the eu . 
  if they can prove they 're coming from a war zone , they can proceed . 
  if they ca n't , they do n't enter the eu . 
  probably half of the technical papers i read these days concern tools and strategies for processing and analyzing large quantities of data . 
  it seems everyone is collecting terabytes of information and trying to figure out ways to exploit it . 
  and yet we have that tunisian suicide-by-cop guy wandering around europe with 20 different identities ? 
  in his case , he should probably have been in psychiatric care , but several of the paris attackers were on suspected extremist lists and nevertheless passed under the radar . 
  hopefully europol has access to the data it needs , and can recruit the right people to process those data effectively . 
  the seven-day week seems to have come from the continental celts who got it from the romans . 
  old irish has : diu luna ( moon ) diu mart ( mars ) diu iath ( meaning uncertain ) diu eathamon ( meaning uncertain ) diu triach ( meaning uncertain ) diu satur ( saturn ) diu srol ( sun ), 
   the word for week is the same as the word for the number seven similar in irish - * seachtain * ( week ) derives from * seacht * ( seven ) . 
  irish days of the week are very much derived from the christian/monastic tradition : d\u00e9 luain ( from latin lunae - moon ) d\u00e9 mairt ( from latin martis - mars ) d\u00e9 c\u00e9adaoin ( first day of fasting ) d\u00e9ardaoin ( day between fasts ) d\u00e9 haoine ( fasting day ) d\u00e9 sathairn ( from latin saturni - saturn ) d\u00e9 domhnaigh ( from latin dominicus - lord 's day ) i think there was a minor fast on wednesdays and a major fast on fridays . 
  there are some antivaxxers in france afaik . 
   that does n't mean they have to make it particularly easy my point is that most people do n't control how easy or hard it is to identify them . 
  that 's controlled by various actors including the state , isps , and online services . 
  as such , people need to be aware that what they say on twitter or facebook is very much in the public sphere and might be traced back to them . 
   poland has europe 's most segmented , inefficient farming sector and all they 're going to do is make the problem even worse ?!, 
  any data on how close ( or far ) poland is to self-sufficiency in agriculture ? 
   while in the newspaper you 're probably one of maybe five people who get interviewed , so your voice carries more weight . 
  yes , good point . 
  i had n't thought about that . 
   it ca n't be worse than what you 've apparently ran away from . 
  exactly . 
  i reckon the people living in tents in calais would change places with them in a heartbeat . 
   one of those comes with the cover of pseudo-anonymity it 's demonstrably not anonymous though . 
  twitter in particular is interesting with respect to the ` real name ' system . 
  their policy is that tying a handle to a real identity is not necessary , but verified accounts for celebs are obviously a major draw for the service . 
   the idea that to express an opinion you need to be fully and readily identifiable is pretty problematic you may be correct about expressing opinion , but what about calling on people to act a certain way ? 
  should a call to arms be attached to an identity ? 
  french police did visit people who expressed support for the ch killers . 
  some young guy got put in jail over tweeting support for isis recently . 
  i 'm not saying that the dutch police are justified , simply that people need to be more aware that what they tweet/post on facebook is being read by more than their immediate circle . 
  people have a weird sense that they can say whatever they like on twitter , but it 's increasingly clear that 's not the case . 
  every few weeks we get a story about someone being brought to court over their tweeting . 
   `` why ca n't we say what we think ? '', 
  asks kim ( 33 ) from kaatsheuvel . 
  she does n't want her last name in the newspaper . 
  there 's a disconnect between what people think they can say on twitter and what they 're prepared to say in a newspaper ( or perhaps in the town square ) . 
   the visit took about twenty minutes and the police acted in a very authoritarian way , according to van wouw . 
  since he has felt limited in his freedom . 
  `` when i post something on facebook , i do realize that the police is possibly reading what i write . '', 
  not to put too fine a point on it , but `` duh '' !, 
  the police are possibly reading it , facebook is definitely storing it , google might be indexing it . 
  your future potential employers will probably have access to it . 
  do n't tweet or post stuff on facebook that you would n't say in public . 
  yes here 's an [ etymological list of the county names ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/etymological_list_of_counties_of_ireland ) ( in many cases same as city ) . 
  no surprise . 
  medecins sans frontieres set up a presence in the jungle last june i think , but they are very understaffed and can only deal with immediate problems . 
  the nearest medical centre is 8 km away , which is easy if you have a car but not so easy on foot . 
  it seemed obvious that the guys at the bataclan at least had trained with automatic weapons . 
  apart from that , i 'm not sure it makes much difference if these guys were in syria and iraq elsewhere - most of them had legitimate european passports and entered europe legally . 
  even if some did n't have european passports , i 'm guessing that isis have the means to acquire same , either forgeries or from their fallen henchmen . 
  we can do a much better job of tracking would-be jihadis , but we ca n't make europe impregnable , especially as we 're producing plenty of homegrown extremists . 
  i do n't see `` local crime news '' listed as off-topic ? 
  i 'm glad germany does this . 
  it 's important that everyone pays into a system that benefits them , whether it 's refugees cashing in some of their valuables , or jobseekers paying social insurance out of their allowance . 
  otherwise we create this idea that paying taxes and social charges is for ` other people ' , not for everyone . 
  yes , i agree . 
  it 's the attention seeking that i think the jihadis and the westboro baptists have in common . 
  they 're trolls , basically , though instead of doing it online they get in people 's faces . 
  watched this last week . 
  the guys made me think of the westboro baptists - do anything for attention , including baiting other muslims and beating on elders outside a mosque . 
  this is violent , childish egotism - one of the guys even said that he `` feels important '' because his passport has been taken by police so he ca n't travel . 
  these guys appeal to disaffected youths by promising easy answers to difficult questions and by making the youths feel special . 
  the guy who 'd gone off to join isis ( with his unfortunate wife and kids ) was idolised by the would-be jihadis back home , even though one suspects they wo n't rush to join him because they 'd probably be killed if they did . 
  my conclusion : it 's a death cult designed to appeal to people 's egotism . 
  for the moment it appears to be a bunch of nobodies plus nigel farage . 
  i grew up with gaelic handball ( outdoor courts mostly ) and i played the `` other '' handball sometimes in school . 
  we called it `` olympic handball '' to differentiate it . 
  our pe teacher was keen on it . 
  so he 's tunisian finally ? 
  i think he was registered in france two years ago as moroccan . 
  europe is going to have get a whole lot better at identifying and tracking migrants and refugees .

  could n't the first three shots have gone into the tires ? 
  i 'd guess the home office can put a stay on the fulfillment of the tribunal 's order while the appeal is in process . 
  yes , understood . 
  this will encourage more migrants/refugees to go to the camps around calais and dunkirk . 
  leaving the eu wo n't make any difference per se : the uk would have to repudiate the echr and potentially the undhr . 
  probably it 's simpler for a higher court to find that this tribunal is wrong . 
  the home office is appealing . 
  ( edit : typo ), 
  does this mean that ukrainians come to poland to fill jobs that would otherwise be unfilled because poles have left poland to go to other parts of the eu ? 
  i 've never understood the location of `` a '' in azerty . 
  `` q '' is the second least frequent letter in english text , so whoever designed azerty decided to replace it with the third most frequent letter in french text ?

  exactly , because the state [ only registered the harp with soundbox facing right ] ( http://www.irishtimes.com/culture/state-feared-guinness-objections-over-plan-to-make-harp-logo-a-trademark-1.1637930 ) to avoid objections from guinness . 
   because the irish are always living in the past says john shelby ... ;-), 
  she 's somewhat similar to depictions of [ britannia ] ( http://www.hansvanlemmen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/29-britannia-on-liverpool-town-hall.jpg ) . 
  i 'm not sure what the inspiration is , but her helmet looks greek rather than roman . 
  i doubt it will make a jot of difference . 
  mass surveillance has become so firmly established that it 'll take a lot more than an echr judgment to start dismantling . 
  i said that anti-israel sentiment results in attacks on jews . 
  here 's the op 's link :  gensing wrote about a `` wave of hatred '' at the `` hate-filled demonstrations against the gaza war '' in 2014 .

  take it up with the author of the report . 
  here 's [ a picture ] ( https://www.flickr.com/photos/matthewsammon/450981568/ ) of the statue the coin depicts .

  ridiculous fallacy . 
  i had someone once tell me that it 's a `` good thing '' that these muslims do n't believe other muslims can do wrong . 
  it supposedly shows how peaceful they perceive their religion to be . 
  but i do n't think that 's what it shows at all . 
  i feel these conspiracy theorist muslims are actually broadly expressing the same inner feelings many of the terrorists have : a complete distrust , if not hate , for the western country or government they live in . 
  obviously though , i also know some muslims who do n't believe in these conspiracies . 
  they 're usually the very moderate and integrated types . 
  those at my job who believe these theories may seem `` moderate '' in everyday life , but speaking to them about other subjects one can quickly realize they 're not moderate to a western perspective , and they 're usually very entrenched in their community . 
  in my experience , many muslims i encounter in france also tend to believe there 's `` something fishy '' each time there 's a muslim terrorist attack . 
  from 9/11 to the recent attacks we had in france , many seem pretty sure it 's the government , whether it 's the grocery store owner down the street , or even seemingly educated muslim people i work with . 
  blows my mind . 
  i 'd rather say women tend to be more moderate , in everything , not just politics . 
  i know , it 's very sexist to say , but it 's noticeable in pretty much everything if you ask me . 
  though i 'd gladly offer an explanation that it 's not for lack of character that they do n't go into `` extreme '' or `` hard '' stuff , it 's rather due to their condition as the `` weaker '' sex in an admittedly masculine society that probably beats them down into staying `` discreet '' or moderate . 
  there 's no doubt that most people properly learn another language only if they practice it beyond what they learned in school . 
  however , that 's pretty much the case for all classes . 
  i forgot much of my chemistry and physics after school because i did n't continue practicing and learning these subjects after . 
  that does n't mean these subjects should n't be taught in school . 
  similarly , i think it 's fine to learn another language in school , and if the student does n't continue it , too bad . 
  but at least he had the opportunity , and learning a 3rd language surely still brought him something intellectually . 
  and at best a select few perhaps may have gained a lot from learning an extra language , for future studies , travel or jobs . 
  i do n't think france does this to appeal to its muslim population at all , considering in other areas , like the full veil ban , or the simple veil ban in public schools , france is often accused by less secular countries of `` oppressing '' its muslim minority . 
  so which one is it ? 
  truth is that france has had lukewarm relations with israel for decades now , and the general vibe in the country 's political class and population has long been rather pro-palestinian , regardless of the muslim minority in france . 
  nah , lyon just barely makes the `` mostly safe to eat '' area although the city is practically the birthplace of * haute cuisine * , and bordeaux / south west of france is in the `` caution '' area which is preposterous . 
  have you even tasted duck confit ?!, 
  but overall i 'd agree that as you move away from southern europe , food becomes comfort food ( which is great in its own right ) , but lesser in quality . 
  that 's obviously due to the climate , which influences cuisine and culture . 
  colder regions having to make due with the products which can be harvested or made up north , which are usually quite rustic ( potatoes , onions , milk , beer , butter ... ) . 
  in the warmer climates down south , there 's a larger choice in herbs and grains and whatnot . 
  france exemplifies this quite superbly thanks to its size and position which includes a warm mediterranean climate , and a northern climate like its northern neighbours . 
  as the north will have classic comfort dishes like galettes ( salt and black wheat cr\u00eapes ) , flammekueche , fries ( chips ) ... the south will have lighter dishes which tend to be more revered in snobby culinary circles ( and with reason ) . 
  also the `` moi , pr\u00e9sident ... '' ( i , president ... ) is a reference to the anaphora current president hollande used during the presidential debates during his campaign , where he described what he 'd do if he were president ( `` i , president of the republic , would do * this * . 
  i , president of the republic , would do * that * ... ) . 
  [ here is the video in french ] ( https://youtu.be/53b-pbpvjma?t=15s ) . 
  it was kind of ridiculous i find , and his opponent sarkozy tried to denounce it , but it probably had its desired effect . 
  so anyway , this cover referencing `` i , president ... '' wants the reader to consider what this one would do . 
  in france as well , and i assume in many other eu countries , free disposable plastic bags in supermarkets have been banned . 
  that 's one of the most sensible ecological changes in recent years imo . 
  a great step in the right direction . 
  in a generation people wo n't even be able to relate to american beauty anymore :p, 
  more like put\u00e4in\u00f6inen . 
  continental germanics and the english , basically . 
  how funny . 
  though the main concentration notably excludes eastern germany . 
  perhaps being a furby is an expensive hobby , or just a vice of the decadent western germanic peoples . 
  wow , dublin takes the cake . 
  dat gorgonzola pic . 
  i 'm pretty classic i guess , but my top 3 are [ comt\u00e9 ] ( http://www.enil.fr/images/illustrations/enil/produits/comte.jpg ) , [ roquefort ] ( roquefort ) , and of course , [ camembert ] ( https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/article_small/public/thumbnails/image/2017/05/09/08/soft-cheese.jpg ) . 
  i would n't put the caucasus countries in europe , because they are mostly south of the caucasus mountains . 
  since we have to define the borders of europe on geographic features , the caucasus mountains seem perfect to do so . 
  and to be fair , it 's only because georgia and armenia are majority christian that some people include them in europe . 
  but apart from that religious factor , culturally and historically , i have a hard time including them in europe . 
  granted , there 's some common history , like georgia participating in the crusades and whatnot , but again , if we start including countries beyond the geographic borders of europe , then we can go on to include syria and jordan and whatnot ... 
  i live in paris and i see them constantly . 
  walking around in big train stations , in touristic areas , or even taking the metro to go to their allocated area . 
  but we 've had these guys walking around paris for decades , way before the recent terrorist attacks . 
  and it does n't bother me . 
  it 's almost pretty cool to me . 
  otherwise i agree , there 's absolutely nothing to be afraid of in general . 
  i feel zero anxiety about terrorism , insecurity , or soldiers walking around with auto weapons . 
  he 's obviously arguing that opposition to public nudity is only a step away from islamic decency laws or social norms which produce such things as full veils and whatnot , under penalty of harsh punishment . 
  i , for one , agree that nudity should n't be frowned upon . 
  similarly to the uk , france is very present in international diplomacy , and has a strongly independent foreign policy around the world , and thus , the more patriot leaning people may consider that the eu is depleting france 's sovereignty . 
  though i personally think the stereotypes of the french being chauvinistic is highly exaggerated , i do concede that many may see france as a great nation on its own . 
  also , france has a large agricultural sector , and like most post-industrial western countries , a failing manufacturing industry . 
  farmers and working class people tend to blame the eu ( = globalization ) for their economic difficulties . 
  france also has a significant leftist core , of which some may see the eu as a huge capitalist monster which could undermine their wishes of social progress . 
  i 'd say those are the three main classes of people who distrust the eu . 
  however , i 'm pretty sure that if there were a frexit referendum tomorrow , the `` stay '' would win by a longshot . 
  there 's distrust , and euroskepticism to a varying degree naturally finds audiences , but people in general still want to stay . 
  really ? 
  do you mean that before 1813 , a thus pre-industrial china had battles involving more than half a million men ? 
  i 'm willing to believe it but i do n't know in what context that would be needed , or how it could be possible before total war and draft efforts of modern nation states . 
  perhaps during the mongol invasions ? 
  or in inter-chinese wars ? 
   the only nations participating were italy , france , russia , austria , prussia and sweden i think those alone are enough to call it `` battle of the nations '' . 
  that 's a lot of participants in a single battle , even during the napoleonic wars which in general were 1v1 or 1v2 at best . 
  no , i 've never witnessed anything like that , and i 've been living in paris for 10 years . 
  and it 's not like i do n't go out , in various neighborhoods of the city . 
  i go all over . 
  i 'm guessing the migrant riots happened in the north or north-east of the city . 
  those are the more `` unsavory '' areas , where apparently migrants go to . 
  i 've been there plenty of times of course , but never witnessed anything noteworthy . 
  it 's a large city . 
  it 's true that when you see something about a city in the news , one subconsciously assumes the city 's life revolves around that issue , but in reality it 's far from the case . 
  i 'm thinking the best time to visit a european city is right after a terrorist attack . 
  no lines , cheaper prices , and probably safer because of stronger security ... more seriously , living in paris i have zero anxiety about terrorism . 
  simply because the chances an attack affects me personally or my close friends and family , in a city of almost 2 million , is minimal if not negligible . 
  in reality , the tourism industry in france does care . 
  the industry was hit pretty hard after the terrorist attacks . 
  they bounced back in general , but it was a hard year . 
  i live in paris , which is arguably the prime destination for migrants in france , and i 've never met a czech immigrant . 
  i 've interacted with czech tourists for my job , but otherwise i know no czech resident or even a frenchman of any czech ancestry , as far as i know . 
  that 's not a cricism . 
  i mean , we in france , despite our large colonial empire , we comparitively did n't emigrate much either . 
  that 's probably why we lost our holdings in north america , and were weak there , but strong in europe with a huge population for european wars . 
  no one fucking left . 
  except huguenots because they had no choice . 
  maybe czechia is just good enough , and the social imperatives are such that the people do n't feel they must leave .

  also i 've had many people thinking my mother language was spanish . 
  or assuming brazilian food is particularly spicy because everybody knows mexican food can be , so logically ... 
  anyway , when that happens , i actually enjoy having the opportunity to teach them something about the other side of the pond . 
  the negative experiences are probably not worth talking about , but they have n't happened very often , 
  i live in germany close to the rhine . 
  because of artificial ponds excavated in close proximity , there 's a number of different insects flying around . 
  i get a lot of different kinds of flies ( a lot of fruit flies but also some bigger ones ) and some mosquitoes too . 
  also pollinators - bees and bumblebees . 
  my cat loves destroying most of those . 
  not the mosquitoes though , i have to take care of those myself : /, 
  for some reason a bunch of people singing [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4om1rqkpiji ) at a karaoke while drinking really expensive alcohol . 
  when you go to lisbon , take a small detour and rent a scooter in cascais at [ this place ] ( http://www.smoother.info/ ) . 
  the guy who owns the place is amazingly helpful and will give you a lot of info on the area . 
  among others , you can visit quinta da regaleira and the pena palace which is probably one of the most beautiful castles i have ever seen . 
  there 's this huge restaurant chain called [ buffalo grill ] ( http://www.buffalo-grill.fr/ ) in france . 
  you can find those everywhere in the country as well as some in other countries ( spain , switzerland ... ) , but it 's a french company . 
  it has this american theme with the usual stuff - burgers , bbq sauces , fries , some tex-mex stuff , etc , but it 's of course adapted to french tastes ( local cheeses , bread , etc ) . 
  not long ago i had a conversation on how every internationally-known , right-wing , nationalist , populist politician - donald trump , marine le pen , geert wilders , frauke petry , nigel farage , you name it - seems to have a significant following in their respective countries but a terrible reputation elsewhere . 
  i think this applies to wilders . 
  you 're not going to find a lot of his fans outside the netherlands . 
  yes and no  you 're right that there is a difference , but there is still a vowel in the french pronunciation . 
  in german it is an `` e '' ( international phonetic alphabet ) , whereas in french it is an '' \u0259 '' ( which sounds a little bit like the `` a `` s in `` america '' ) . 
  but in everyday life the difference is not very perceptible and a french person could still giggle depending on his or her maturity , 
  or japanese ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ), 
  i have an internal joke with some friends abour our utter inability to learn german correctly and we deliberately say `` tsch\u00fc\u00fc\u00fcusss ! '', 
  as we toast . 
  we have had some weird looks from strangers in bars :d, 
  even better with the german * bitte * , which means `` please '' and `` you 're welcome '' depending on the context . 
  so polite germans say it all the time . 
  and it sounds * exactly * like french `` dick '' . 
  ah , another detail involving portuguese and other romance languages : people usually say something like `` tchin tchin '' or `` tchin '' as they toast . 
  in french it 's usually just `` tchin '' , in portuguese you usually say it twice . 
  i 've heard saying something close to `` tchin tchin '' in japanese means dick . 
  so you got ta be careful with that . 
  ok , here 's a story i like . 
  i 've heard of a czech music professor who moved to brazil and had a fair share of difficulties with portuguese . 
  often , he 'd read things , only know some of the words in portuguese , and fill the gaps with things those words looked like . 
  a very common road sign in brazil states : '' * curva perigosa * '' : dangerous curve ahead . 
  well , this guy knew that perigosa meant dangerous . 
  and curva ... well , i think kurva means whore in czech ( somebody correct me if i 'm wrong ! ) . 
  so he interpreted those signs everywhere as `` dangerous bitch '' . 
  and he kept wondering what was wrong with the locals . 
  there are two regions that often produce decent beers to my knowledge : brittany and nord-pas-de-calais ( * lol hauts-de-france lololol * ) . 
  there 's [ an trappist beer that is produced in france , too ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/trappist_beer#other_trappist_beers ) . 
  i 'm also a fan of the fischer brewery in alsace . 
  and i 've even tried some craft beers produced in dr\u00f4me that were pretty damn good . 
  in any case , all the best french beers are definitely not mainstream . 
  as is often the case , the most popular beers are pretty bad : kronenbourg and 1664 . 
  you can add france , spain , portugal , italy , and a lot of non-european countries ( e.g. 
  latin america ) to the list of `` odd ones '' i guess . 
  i 'm currently renting an apartment in an area where the average cost of renting is about 10 $ / m \u00b2 .

  and then they requested ... pasta for breakfast . 
  but i guess this is related to a specific need for high-level sports . 
  i guess it 's a great source of carbs and they needed that . 
  but yes , there are rules that are expected to be respected , particularly in countries where there 's this food-and-drink-loving cult like france and italy . 
  there are things you do n't mix , and things you do n't eat or drink depending on the time of the day . 
  i generally act in accordance with all those rules but when i 'm by myself they can go out of the window . 
  a bowl of cereals for dinner when nobody 's watching ? 
  sign me up . 
  edit : another interesting story about my partner 's experience in hotels : german customers in france have complained several times about the complete absence of sparkling wine in the breakfast buffet . 
  it always struck us as a weird thing to ask for . 
  and then we noticed that a lot of german hotels have it ... , 
  or more commonly , `` non mais cr\u00e8ve , putain ! '' . 
  french is so romantic . 
  in some parts of germany ( e.g. 
  rheinland-pfalz , close to the french border ) it 's also pretty common to say `` merci '' . 
  i was quite surprised when somebody said it to me the first time as i was holding the door that person . 
  i thought `` what the hell , i did n't even say a word !, 
  how does he know i speak french ?! '', 
  it 's funny how it 's actually frowned upon to try and pronounce english words correctly when you 're in france . 
  for example ... if you 're saying an english word , you should n't try and pronounce the letter r the way native english speakers would do . 
  it sounds like you 're trying too hard or that you 're just showing off . 
  instead , if you refer to the popular `` tinder '' app , you should pronounce it * tindeur * with a french * eur * , or you 're just being a prick . 
  i 'm quite partial to * shampoo * . 
  in france , not only people call it * shampooing * , but the ing is actually pronounced the french way ( i.e. 
  a nasal * in * like one would pronounce * lin * gerie ) . 
  this is not the case for other loanwords ending in - ing , like parking or jogging . 
  i do n't know how that happened . 
   instead i learned , `` bonjour monsieur oiseau . 
  le mason c'est rouge '' , and other such nonsensical balderdash . 
  meanwhile , english classes in france are all about `` where is bryan ? 
  bryan is in the kitchen '' . 
  ask any frenchman where bryan is , he 'll just * know * the kitchen is the only correct answer . 
  comments on * dreaming about a bank * coming in 3 ... 2 ... 1 ... 
  a little bit ... then again , i guess that goes for the whole continent or a big part of it . 
  in the case of germany , i 'm mostly referring to the * besserwisser * - type of people . 
  some people really have to show they know better than you , and they seem bizarrely common around here , especially at work ... might be just my personal experience .

  europe can just not sustain all the misery in the fucking world . 
  street vendors can be annoying , but scary ? 
  it 's going a bit far , i mean i do n't see how little gold eiffel towers can be threatening . 
  foreign policy is n't really used as a campaign ad thing in france . 
  it 's mostly shadowy and very blurred . 
  i think all the politicians know what france 's interests abroad are and do n't want to talk about it because it may sound imperialistic . 
  yeah , but you do n't get free refill in the french mcdonald 's . 
  and that 's just outrageous . 
  the european union did n't exist in the fifties . 
  it was just a commercial agreement between france and germany at first , and commercial ties had existed before ww2 , so that only would not be valid . 
  ask pakistan , they 've been led by extremists for decades and it has n't created any nuclear apocalypse . 
  afraid . 
  peace in europe was maintained primarily by us troops and nuclear deterrence . 
  btw i do n't see why all the guys who returned are not tried on the charges of treason . 
  one of the results of that charge can be to lose citizenship and be `` exiled '' . 
  i mean no one is going to stand up for their right of having joined is . 
  my bad then , i always thought they had never changed it . 
  anyways , it 's fairly easy to say that russians will never want to join a union mainly dominated by german and french politicians . 
  and they consider siberia as a very important part of their nation . 
  and that 's fine , i would also always fight to say the alsace-lorraine is french , but at least it 's in fucking europe . 
  anyways , russians hardly consider themselves european and do n't have the same standards . 
  we even have a different calendar . 
  see , when i read that someone `` never considered petain as a traitor '' i am enraged . 
  it 's not the fact that he surrendered there 's no problem with that we had lost , but he explicitly said that france was `` sick '' ever since the revolution and became a dictator , and that is treason . 
  because the most important moment of the french nation , and subsequent birth of french nationalism arrived with the french revolution when people put the nation and its constitution as more important than the king , contrary to people like le pen who think that joan of arc fought for the french nation . 
  i do n't care what he thinks about the gas chambers . 
  i do n't care he tortured algerians during the war . 
  i do n't care that he is racist : all of that , he has a right to , because we are in a democracy , and because he has a right to be a stupid asshole who does n't understand what france is . 
  but praising one of the men who spat on the very founding of our nation and made us hitler 's whores , that is betrayal , and that is why this man is no french patriot . 
  to me , he is the equivalent of a royalist vend\u00e9en that i would have gladly sent to the guillotine . 
  i do n't want russia in the eu . 
  more than half of it is asian . 
  legal weed in the netherlands, 
  well , at the time spain and portugal were crumbling empires . 
  that 's exactly the kind of line you throw to say that you 're replacing the sick old man who is now `` useless '' with a new young empire . 
  nah , i would leave the english only with positions about finance or economy . 
  after all , they are a nation of shopkeepers . 
  one of them was killed and they lost around 20 guys in exchange . 
  the somalis tweeted the cross the guy was wearing being all happy they had been able to shoot one . 
  only two countries in the eu speak english as a first language . 
  two others speak german as a first language . 
  three of them speak french as a first language ( france , belgium , luxembourg ) . 
  the two capitals are in french-speaking countries . 
  on top of that we free dutch hostages in the desert while the uk is debating whether it should leave . 
  that 's why it 's unfair , we put a lot of work being all-powerful masters and realizing the emperor 's dreams and now we are sad . 
  :( edit : the article is also wrong in saying that young french would accept english as a lingua franca . 
  in downtown paris and bordeaux yeah of course , but anywhere else , the suburbs , the countryside . . 
  absolutely not . 
  i accept english if in exchange frenchmen dominate every sphere of the administration , army , and executive branches . 
  indeed , but they were quickly latinized as vassals to the king of the franks . 
   reality is japan recruited the french to modernize their army yep , france had the better military prestige in the world under napoleon iii following the crimean war and his interventions in lebanon . 
  and he was napoleon 's nephew , so it sounded cool . 
  just like the last samurai where tom cruise played some random yankee instead of the real life french who fought with the shogun . 
  let the plebs all learn english , i shall honhon with the true masters of yurop just like the normans did when they dominated england . 
  so please present me with your grand solution . 
  deport them all ? 
  france then is treated as intolerant and racist . 
  give them shelter ? 
  why should we pay for people who entered the territory illegally and do n't even want to stay ? 
  either go engage , or probably cower and stay in canada where it 's safe . 
  i ca n't really predict that i 'd have the courage to go to the army , even though i like to think that . 
  marechal de france is so hard to get that there is no living one right now . 
  you 'd need to lead and flawlessly win a campaign against a real military power to get that . 
  self determination and human rights are definitely not the same . 
  the american revolution was about determination as a country , but not about human rights . 
  the french revolution was about human rights , but completely trumped over sovereignty with the invasions of belgium , italy , or switzerland, 
  this dick farage keeps telling everything wrong is because of the european union 's free movement , and that the uk should control its own borders . 
  but one , the schengen space in not within the eu and is between countries directly , and second britain is not part of it and alread controls its borders . 
  this man is either an idiot , or a liar . 
  youtube with porn , guys !, 
  title is wrong . 
  the article says he was staying at a hotel near the charles de gaulle airport which is way off paris , i can assure you any classy hotel in the capital in which famous people go to would never do such a thing . 
  let them become a russian slave . 
  greece has lied to europe in order to get the euro and repaid debts to banks thanks to money from the leading economies of the eu . 
  there 's just a moment when there are consequences . 
  matteo renzi seems to be one of the best leaders of europe right now . 
  i remember him calling for a political europe recently . 
  he is literally the frank underwood of europe : getting to this post that young proves his political mettle , and on top of that he seems to understand today 's dynamics far better than old francois hollande . 
  because you think we 're not trying to do that ? 
  if they wanted to be french , there would n't be any problem . 
  the english, 
  you forget austria during glorious charles v. 
  bismarck 's mighty mustache was the best thing about imperial germany . 
  green cards can be given to foreigners in exchange of service in the us armed forces , lots of people from latin american countries go through that , the requirement is just to speak good english i think . 
  and as far as i know you do n't need to relinquish your previous nationality . 
  french was taught to people who went to school and i guess that a lot of young men ended up learning it with conscription and needing to understand their orders . 
  but it is in the late 19th that mandatory school in french killed these languages . 
  it was probably within the jacobin program to force french though , but the revolutionaries had enough problems on their hands and were n't going to alienate cultures on top of that . 
  anyways , there was n't enough time for the revolution to kill languages : the period lasted from 1789 to 1815 , that 's two generations , way too little time to destroy languages . 
  for example we can say today that the local dialects are dead but it 's fairly recent ( 40 years or so ) , but grandparents still know breton or basque or corsican . 
  that means that is took from jules ferry education reforms in the 1880s to the second half of the 20th century to finish the process , that 's way longer than what the revolutionaries had . 
  lots of the conquered provinces did n't speak french , but that was n't much of a difference for french nationalists because even on the original territory 80 % of people did n't speak french at the time . 
  during the revolution and the empire , nationalism was n't based on language , but on the enlightenment . 
  for them , anyone could be french . 
  silly belgium tries to find an excuse for not being stronk enough to conquer more land and have as much as everyone else . 
  canada : us of a with healthcare, 
  of course he did . 
  every french president until sarkozy almost openly said that european integration correlated with french grandeur . 
  what is that guy 's logic , that mexico would dare attack the us with outdated russian weapons ? 
  i propose the louvre to become seat of the yuropean imperator .

  paris are the kings of car burning while marseille are the kings of score settling between drug dealers, 
  ah the good old division charlemagne !, 
  grandpa only had good things to say about it !, 
  with huge constraints though . 
  til russia is in nato . 
  there are something like 200k professional soldiers in countries like ours that 's very very from enough to defend a whole country from an invasion . 
  but ... why ? 
  if you get through the bother of eating halal you probably are a practicing muslim , are n't you ? 
  i have to admit i do n't know a lot about their religion but it seems to make sense . 
  who would fight for your country , then ? 
  i do n't know , the g36 looks nice to me since they fixed their overheating problem . 
  same for ec665 tigre helicopter and the leopard 2 is pretty universally recognized as a great battle tank . 
  do you think of anything specific you think sucks or is it just a clich\u00e9 ? 
  why would n't it be ? 
   mr sutherland , who is non-executive chairman of goldman sachs international and a former chairman of oil giant bp , heads the global forum on migration and development why am i not surprised ? 
  yeah maybe not standard but certainly not unheard of . 
  the endgame is just to survive as countries and civilizations without killing each other in the process . 
  that 's your victory condition . 
  i do n't think isis chances are very good in this regard . 
  if you look at history any country or organization that relied solely on terror and barbary to exist ends up losing in the long term . 
  does not mean they wo n't do a lot of damage while they exist though . 
  i saw the video . 
  as i said so far no element points to terrorism . 
  maybe there will be , maybe there wo n't . 
  past experiences of this kind of vandalism makes me say there are good chances it wo n't be linked to terrorism ( especially since they went through the effort of making people leave the bus ) . 
  i am not really competent to make an in-depth analysis but if i had to wager i would guess it 's the good old mix of poverty , immigration and reclusiveness that our politicians seemed to enjoy so much in the 60 's / 70 's . 
  it 's pretty standard saint-denis bullshit . 
  they made everyone evacuate the bus before setting it on fire . 
  no link to terrorism or anything so far , it 's just vandalism . 
  he knows since there are good chances of him being behind it . 
  i think the idea short term is to kick any imam preaching hate then replace them with imams more compatible with our values . 
   french authorities have shut down around 20 mosques and prayer halls considered to be preaching radical islam since december it has been an ongoing process for some time actually . 
  i am way too lazy for that . 
   the `` vlasovites '' were afterwards all executed and their role in the uprising not really mentioned during communism rule . 
  oh yeah , the ol russian purgaroo, 
   he is becoming more authoritarian . 
  we do . 
  we had a few colonies in the area and some of them immigrated to france after decolonization . 
  the maghrebi people are probably our first immigration because they are much closer geographically but asian people in france are not a rarity . 
  [ purge it in flame ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r28nz7eo_z4 ), 
  i do n't think anyone has problems with migrants just looking at girls honestly , providing they do n't stare . 
  we did that with vietnamese people in the sixties and it worked totally okey . 
  the only vietnamese descendants i know in france are engineers , it workers and shop owners . 
  one of the first generation guys has a phd in radiochemistry and does security check for our nuclear plants which requires a pretty important clearance . 
  the guys just rolled their sleeves when they landed and got shit done . 
  they did not complain , they did not look for excuses they just did what was needed . 
  it 's not integration . 
  they already know that women should not be raped , this is just insulting . 
  their mistake is that they assume those who choose to rape do n't know raping is wrong but they do . 
  they just do n't care because they think we are weak as fuck . 
  you want integration ? 
  talk to them about the culture , what norwegian people like to eat , the history , the language , how to start a business here , how to find a job etc. . . 
  also no one prevents him from looking at girls . 
  i look at girls all the time . 
  just do n't do it in a creepy way and do n't try to get a feel . 
  as our greatest singer said : `` dear little jesus , since you got your dick in a hooker before , would you have the balls to go back without a condom in order to please the pope ? '', 
  yep , makes perfect sense . 
  does n't it proves that these people just can not find a job and that putting pressure on them is stupid ? 
  i mean if they could find a job instead of working for 0 $ they certainly would . 
  yeah you are completly right . 
  the french communist party used to be for a strict immigration control in order to protect the european workers . 
  today the far left is all in favor of immigration and they are bleeding voters like never because the workers feel they have been betrayed and would rather vote for fn . 
  no one cares about what isis thinks of it . 
  it sure sends the good messages to those tempted to perform such acts in the future : your whole community will treat you as trash . 
  it already happened with mohammed merah . 
  toulouse did not want to bury him in their city for fear of glorification . 
  he ended up being buried outside of the city in an unmarked grave . 
  `` but we are totally down with western values of democracy , free speech and freedom we swear . '', 
  you do n't fuck around with overdue books do you ? 
  what some people would do to not admit they were wrong ... 
  instead of hitler telling you to genocide people it 's some guy in the sky who may or may not exist and who may or may not be actually telling you to do that , no one is really sure . 
  i am torn on this . 
  on a side i think people deserve to know who did the thing and information should be available in a democracy . 
  on an another side i think having their faces plastered everywhere is at least part of why they do this . 
  it was not an attack mind you , it was just a random info you will be able to tell at barbecues . 
   or is it the problem with the french ( federal ? ), 
  government setting the bar too low that allow shit like this to become common ? 
  not terribly relevant to the topic but france is not a federation , we only have one state and that is france . 
  they probably want christians to radicalize like them so they can have their holy war . 
  starting a holy war against `` rome '' ( that 's how they call western countries ) has been in their plan from the start and the fact we just bomb them frustrate them . 
  that 's the case of most people who acted in france recently : they never were there and never had direct contact with isis , they were all muslims who watched propaganda vids online and decided to act . 
  what i say is simply that once isis is out of the equation i think the problem will fade by itself over a few decades . 
  maybe it 's just me being an optimist but i think optimism may always be good . 
  i am not saying it is not going to be a bumpy ride mind you . 
  i am just saying that i think it will get better at some point in the future . 
  could be in 20 years . 
  islamic state is still an inspiring presence to some at the moment . 
  at some point they will be defeated on the ground and will get back to be the cave dwelling terrorists doing shitty videos in vhs tape quality . 
  they will still inspire people to do bad things that 's for sure but they wo n't be the wonderful islamic state heaven for true muslims they currently are for some and the attacks will get rarer as they are gradually flushed in the great toilets of history . 
  eventually they will just become the guys who lost . 
  no one will care how . 
  we could compare that to hitler . 
  while he was a live and kicking he had millions of people following him . 
  now , decades after his death the only people i know who really claim to be his successors are generally losers who never managed to fit in society . 
  the same will happen to daesh . 
  it will take decades probably but i am sure of it . 
  all things considered , europe has seen much worse . 
  i think we will be okey in the long run . 
  i am not downplaying things or anything and my heart deeply bleeds for the victims , what i am saying is that we knew two world wars on our soil and we are still here and doing well . 
  sometimes i wonder if the islamists think about this kind of things when they try to `` break '' us .

  others were simply retarded . 
  twin twin was awful , jessy matador , last year could have been good . 
  about ww1 but it was so friggin depressing . 
  there are way better french songs about ww1 . 
  let people become atheists . 
  it 's not bad . 
  \\ \\ the \\ \\ year latex :p, 
  that 's why i advocate for making voting mandatory , so that polls would make things irrelevat . 
   but how many of our players are going to be injured during the game ? 
  you can not tackle a player that is n't plaing the ball . 
  this is n't american football . 
   have https available ( or default like facebook , gmail etc. . ) ignoring that the ca emitter can issue fake certs for those websites [ like it already happened ] ( http://arstechnica.com/security/2015/10/still-fuming-over-https-mishap-google-gives-symantec-an-offer-it-cant-refuse/ ) , that the servers can use weak encryption [ like it already happened , yeey inria for finding out ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/freak ) , ( of course i wont mention heartbleed ) , [ how the ssl is broken ] ( http://www.theregister.co.uk/2011/04/11/state_of_ssl_analysis/ ) , sslstrip that can remove the ssl layer without telling , all the data your computer might transmit without using encryption , you 'll still have people that 'll click on accepting unauthorized certs because hey what the hell is an authorized certificate ? 
  i 'm no power user of linux , just lite and i barely know all the possibilities . 
  it 's safe to assume the vast majority of users dont know it . 
  with ssh you still need a secure server to connect to . 
  except the one at my lab , i dont have any other , and id rather not do private browsing that will go on my work network . 
   problem and blocking a democratic process a democratic process might be to kill the 49 % but that doesnt make it legal . 
   good old ignoring and crying anticonstitutional well apparently the courts decided that it 's anticonstitutional . 
  you can not have a modern state if you ignore what your courts of law decide . 
  you can not wave the flag of self determination and get a free pass to do whatever you want . 
  what 's stopping 3 guys in their shed to ask for self determination ? 
  it was a valid concern when you 'd have second class `` citizens '' inside multi-national empires such as the austro-hungarian empire . 
  what proof do you have that catalunyans are second class citizens in modern day spain ? 
  because you sound like those wacko americans that proclaim they 're free citizens :  https://www.reddit.com/r/amibeingdetained  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcozh_vbydm  i do not consent !, 
  [ the making of the atomic bomb by richard rhodes ] ( http://www.amazon.com/the-making-atomic-bomb-anniversary/dp/1451677618 ), 
  dunno about you , but the book just hits me of christian propaganda . 
  i understand why for its period , it 's normal , but i dont think it aged well . 
   podemos is the only major party in spain that supports a referendum on catalan sovereignty . 
  reminds of those old time communist parties that were very much for breaking up countries . 
  so you have to connect through cygwin ( cuz i doubt the majority of users have linux ) to a server you 've already connected before to use ssh safely . 
  how many people do that in an airport ? 
  not to mention that xwindows tends to be super slow over ssh so browsing the internet is a tedious experience . 
  hey , they 're be one retard that brought some serious shit from the war . 
  find me an example of someone shooting mortars . 
  after some googling , it 's fireworks mortars . 
  yeah ... 
  totally mortars . 
  retarded journalists being retarded . 
  mortar fire ? 
  are we being serious now ? 
  there are areas were the police have to go well prepared but this is ridiculous . 
  that being the news paper is connected to the right - extreme right and has already made ridiculous statements that have no backing . 
  the mortar statement is ridiculous , the others i 'd take a heavy dose of salt . 
   in august 2014 , an article in french magazine ** valeurs actuelles ** ( contemporary values ) mentioned 750 lawless areas where police officers might be met with serious assault , including mortar fire . 
  okay ... 
  honest question : why would anyone use a public wifi connection ? 
  do you like having all your data snooped at ? 
  redirected to fake websites to have your passwords stolen ? 
  not you , the other dude . 
  there are air france planes between moscow and the states . 
  i dont understand why anyone would do that , when they have the option to take only one company . 
  this is the type of situation where you dont wan na be a hot potato . 
  did you book the same company from moscow to the states ? 
  because if you change companies , you can expect this type of mess . 
  20 mins to move around cdg is impossible , its too big . 
  regarding airports , brussels airport was pretty boring . 
   out of the low cost airports well there 's your problem right there , 
  1790 borders . 
  we 're all jelly . 
  we can have a nuke war . 
  who wins gets nice . 
  okay ? 
  it was taken for a few decades then piedmont got it in 1814, 
  wuuut ? 
  after we fought together against those austrians ? 
  you crai crai . 
  why ? 
  it wont be valid in the uk soon ? 
  in reverse italy gave us nice and savoy cuz we helped them solve an austrian problem . 
  thanks guys , nice is super nice . 
  it 's a statement man . 
  it 's saying hey we 're your neighbours now . 
  today shield , tomorrow icbms , who knows amirite ? 
   the u.s. government has maintained that the shield in romania , and its planned sister installation in poland , is aimed at countering a nuclear threat from iran -- not russia . 
  cuz that statements is more believable . 
  dude it 's just a physical before the job . 
  a lot of jobs require to get a physical , if not most . 
   and hamas spend eu development money in buying weapons dude , we 're talking about the west bank . 
  in the west bank the ruling party is fatah and not hamas . 
  keep things relevant , okay . 
   because the ` eu ' , claiming to represent europe , tries to make a statement , well i support such a policy . 
   example israel we are fighting similar battles in the middle east and in different places of the world . 
  and we 're fighting the same battle with russia against isis , that does n't mean we 'll sweep the ukranian issue under the rug . 
  honestly , if israel feels it does no harm , what 's the problem woth putting a label on it . 
  would n't you be proud of it ? 
   not that completely different really . 
  many of our proudest moments involve killing each other , so yeah i 'd call that as a different history . 
  while i am no very familiar with indian history , i do understand thar different parts have different histories and different heritage . 
  but we can mention pakistand bangladesh india and the problems that happened because of that split . 
  making a huge federation would just make us look like belgium . 
  a country split in two , with one part resenting the other and just bickering about pointless issues . 
  better we be close friends that bitter spouses i say . 
  ( yeah yeah i know its mean , especially to a belgian but honestly there 's too much heterogeneity to make a federation here ) . 
  actually since it 's tax payer mone i 'll assume that they have certain rules to abide . 
  messa tinks tump tump peety dum dum . 
   . that decided to have common eu law and rules that stand above nations ' law and rules . 
  some laws and not others . 
  some of the most important ones : the penal codes are up to each country to define . 
  in the uk , they decided to have some sort of ban on porn . 
  in germany they ca n't watch normal youtube because of silly copy right laws and their nazi games dont have the symbols , in france we 're in a state of emergency that makes it kinda a police state .

  it 's the same principle though . 
  it 's the same principle as winner-takes-all but with two rounds , you have a weird definition of opposite . 
  i thought this was banned on / r/france because there were too many posts about it and it was polluting the sub . 
  this makes no sense here . 
   i am for understanding of motives and analizing problems . 
  you must admit , that the burkini ban is a sign of a problem . 
  if you just say : `` racist !, 
  '' , that basically closes the discussion . 
  your motivations are good but drawing a specific case out of nowhere is n't a very thorough analysis . 
  ireland has a similar law . 
  you 're saying you ca n't wear a cross in public in france . 
  i 'm saying you can and that you 're confusing a ban on religious symbols in school with a ban on religious symbols in public areas which does n't exist . 
  no , religious symbols are only forbidden in schools . 
  you can wear them in other public areas . 
  how do you get people integrated , exactly ? 
  seems like the magic formula was never found , so people begin to prefer ostracism . 
  i would think the 1 % refers to estate rather than income , otherwise it would put a big earner who squanders everything above a wealthy heir who does n't work . 
  i may be wrong though . 
  i do n't think there are many countries where studies are costless , tuition fees are n't the whole picture . 
  you 're right , what an odd comparison . 
  if it was indeed similar , it should be even better to let the plumbers decide among them who is the most competent , since they know the skill . 
  that 's an argument for technocracy . 
  the guillotine was supposed to be less barbaric than normal beheading . 
  no you do n't pay anything ( or 5 $ or so ) if you have a scholarship . 
   send them back to the middle east and quarantine the entire area . 
  oh , yeah , of course . 
  why not nuke the entire muslim world while we 're doing crazy infeasible and stupid ideas ? 
  le pen is purely an opportunist , her opinion on whether we should exit the eu or not changes with each day . 
  ukraine is n't the whole of europe , it has history with russia . 
  i do n't recall spain or sweden ever being in russia 's sphere of influence , so i do n't see why they should fear it more than islamists . 
  russian plans to destroy europe exist only in some eastern europeans ' wild imagination . 
  on the contrary , the actions of islamists are very real . 
  was turkey unsafe and unstable ? 
  no , it was n't . 
  so a military coup serves nothing but western interests , and that 's why you people are supporting it . 
  yes they kept their country stable . 
  but between a country stable thanks to elections and a country stable thanks to repression i chose the former , even more so since the latter risks to pull a libya / syria / iraq . 
  yeah , so why have more dictators and run such a risk again ? 
  who else will ? 
  you could care about the people you leave behind and who have to face the problems you avoided , but i guess values are just relative . 
  why would you want your leaders representing idiots ? 
  why frame it as a democracy if you actually want it to be the opposite ? 
  why should they ever vote , if they 're so ignorant ? 
  to me it just seems like an argument for technocracy or a very restricted democracy . 
  this is a divisive subject in france , you can not paint it as wholly agreed by all parts of society . 
  doing something about it is letting the historians do their work without interference . 
  sure the pay is terrible , but i ca n't imagine many french historian having been corrupted by turkey . 
  and in the absence of evidence ( your article is restricted to the usa ) , this law makes no sense . 
  really the justification for this law is transparent in op 's article : feelings . 
  and even if there were corrupted french historians , the other historians should prove their point by the strength of their arguments and not by illegitimate state support . 
  interdiction only gives leverage to the revisionists ' arguments , since it draws in the direction of a conspiracy . 
  where are the militias ? 
  where is the charismatic leader ? 
  where is the single party ? 
  where is the repression of any opposition ? 
  etc, 
  he did say most , though , which is n't wrong , but a bit rich considering the job he had himself . 
   these all seem like exactly how a democracy is supposed to function . 
  except the european constitution though , there was n't a new referendum for the lisbon treaty . 
  but i would n't call it out on the eu , this is the fault of domestic politicians who think they know better than their people . 
  i see this a lot . 
  why do n't you wait to see how it goes before handing out insults ? 
  of course if you frame the referendum so that people vote stupidly they will . 
  explain what budgets will be cut , they will think instead . 
  people fighting to preserve their labour rights , the horror ... 
   banning all guns is not going to make it harder for them either . 
  i do n't see how that could n't . 
  they have to hide it at the moment . 
  guns are n't only an issue with terrorists anyway . 
  and it says something of our society if more violence is the solution . 
  there are still primaries for his party . 
  the most likely nominee ( and almost certain winner if it 's him ) is alain jupp\u00e9 , but he also has been convicted in the past . 
  it 's a fucked state of affairs but it 's nothing really new sadly . 
  here you can see some of the predicted combinations and their estimated outcomes , though mind the election is one year ahead . 
  actually , there are good chance he 'll win if he faces marine le pen on the second round , which is what he 's betting on . 
  rsa is not a basic income , you do n't receive anything if you already earn enough , you have to make the initiative to get it , and you have to be older than 25 . 
   but why not debate upon our opinions , like civilized human beings ? 
  and that 's what i 'm asking you !, 
  calling those you do n't like politically commies are fascists when they clearly are not makes for low level of debate . 
  that 's what you said . 
  i ca n't read in your mind so if you 're past calling names the discussion would be more fruitful . 
   le pen is also much more tolerable than melenchon , at least for me . 
  sure , why not ? 
  but you ca n't expect everyone to hold the same opinion as you do . 
  m\u00e9lenchon is not a communist and le pen is not a fascist . 
  you have a terribly simple understanding of the world , seriously . 
  maybe try to learn more about those school of thoughts before labeling people . 
  it does n't seem to me that / r/europe likes m\u00e9lenchon , just take a look at this thread and many are criticising his views on the eu . 
  on the contrary , this sub has circlejerked a lot around macron those last few months . 
  i guess they still find m\u00e9lenchon more tolerable than le pen because she 's seen as xenophobic and he is not , and since his opposition to the eu in its current form is not out of nationalism . 
  have you ever tried to compare the communist manifesto and m\u00e9lenchon 's platform ? 
  because you have a very weird sense of what 's a communist . 
  you were right indeed . 
  i saw [ this video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffkukm-l5a8 ) , where he speaks right after [ this speech from lordon ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l23zrvnl1f4 ) , and where he considers that plan a is practically doomed to fail , but deserves to be tried nonetheless . 
  i had gotten the wrong impression . 
  and yesterday at onpc he said that a no the referendum would mean plan b so there would be no second referendum on france 's membership as you said . 
  so yes , if m\u00e9lenchon applies this there 's a very good chance we leave the euro and the eu . 
  the eu is the embodiment of free market . 
  indeed we should . 
   how will he campaign ?

  it 's surprising the ep got convinced by it , but it will definitely not be approved by the national governments . 
  mr ( s ) . 
  is n't there already one ( article 222 of tfeu ) ? 
  that the passport is false does n't mean it was n't used specifically to enter as a refugee . 
  ** edit : ** it 's confirmed the terrorist * did * enter through greece as a refugee ; his fingerprints match those taken at the time . 
  so not only we let terrorists in but do n't even check that their passport is legit . 
  you do realize it is `` growing '' because of children being born into it , right ? 
  [ if you take natality out of it , you get a very , very different picture of how dynamic and attractive christianity is at the moment compared to other religions and to atheism . 
  and make mexico pay for it . 
  well i stand corrected , it seems you guys were right about isis implication , specific targetting of france from abroad and the use of false asylum seekers . 
  some interesting thought : in the 70s western europe was plagued by communist terrorism , and by 1990 communism was pretty much dead everywhere in the world . 
   and support their agenda . 
  which is ? 
  in france , the national front will not `` deport muslims '' or do anything really different from the current government besides relatively tougher immigration policies , which is quite irrelevant since we 're talking about homegrown terrorism . 
  what i can predict with an fn government though , is that they 'll do all their possible to provoke minorities to riot , so that white people get scared and keep voting for them . 
  the fn has nothing to gain from better assimilation , integration , secularization of muslims and peace . 
  it has all interest in stirring shit up and plunging our country into ethnic conflict . 
  if they get to power , i 'll be on my way to switzerland . 
  the far-right has no real plan to solve theterrorism issue , and i 'm not sure it even wants to solve the issue . 
  on the contrary , all it does is feeding itself from it without having to do any work thinking and trying to solve problems . 
  you just have to take a look at the candidates they have for parliament , they 're just random people who accepted to have their names on the posters but never gave a speech , wrote anything or really are involved in politics at all ( some just posting a few racist tweets but that 's it ) . 
  they just put the fn logo next to their name and recolt the sweet sweet votes . 
  there was jihadist terrorism long before isis and destroying isis would not stop it , especially since it certainly gave no real financial or operational support for the attacks , which were most likely home-grown as all the previous ones . 
  you can topple a genocidal organization like isis but it 's much more difficult to topple a genocidal * ideology * like jihadism . 
  edit : turns out i was wrong , and isis really is involved . 
  we know perfectly who is doing those attacks , and who will probably do the next . 
  not `` muslims '' , but a list of a couple thousand radical islamists . 
  they are already under surveillance , but it is not possible to spy properly on all of them , so shit like this keep happening . 
  we do n't know much yet about yesterday 's attackers but the previous ones were always already supposed to be under surveillance . 
  discriminating or even `` kicking out '' millions of muslims because of their religion or origins would be ridiculously unfair . 
  but we can and should definitely act against those ~ 5000 people . 
  surveillance is not enough . 
  we ca n't just keep enemy fighters at home and hope they wo n't do anything . 
  what we could do is arrest and judge all of them for treason/intelligence with the enemy/apology of terrorism for supporting or having links with the is/jihadism . 
  but then they 'll just be in our prisons , and i 'd rather have them completely out . 
  what i 'd like is to purely and simply take back the citizenship and nationality of people who fight against france 's very fundamental principles . 
  basically if you would not be accepted for naturalization , you are not french ( even if you were born so ) . 
  claiming the contrary implies that deciding nationality is just a matter of birth and we ca n't change it , but that 's obviously wrong and contrary to france 's conception of the nation . 
  if people want to share our culture and values and live with us together , then they are our brothers ; but so if they actively reject our culture , our values , and kill us , then i do n't see how they are supposed to be part of the family . 
  if it happens to people without any other nationality , it would breach the international convention on apatrides , but we are perfectly free to take back our signature and i think it is perfectly justified to do so . 
  those apatrides could just be placed in retention camps with illegal immigrants , and wait there until another country accepts to take them in . 
   those who support them that 's the key . 
  we are democratic countries , and as far as i 'm concerned i * do * support bombing isis or fighting against jihadists in mali . 
  it makes sense that from the perspective of a jihadist i am equally guilty and deserving of death . 
  even if you do n't get that pretty flawed logic , i guess you can see how it 's possible for a particularly deluded , gullible and angry person to fall for it . 
  you 're right in general but these attacks were carefully planned and coordinated . 
  it 's not the same as the usual relatively lone wolves . 
  there have been * many * other averted attacks . 
  [ the last one just two days ago . 
  ] ( http://www.france24.com/en/20151110-france-foils-terrorism-attack-toulon-naval-base-jihad ), 
  al qaida has been in shambles for years though . 
  and the caliphate they called for would have normally united all jihadists around the world , while isis only is recognized ( in theory ) by boko haram . 
  just because there were spectacular attacks does n't mean there is a `` total confrontation '' . 
  people should really calm down . 
  the point of terrorism is precisely to make people far more afraid than they rationally should . 
  there are maybe a dozen of attackers tonight . 
  against millions and millions of people . 
  isis is at most 150,000 people . 
  that is utterly pathetic . 
  the last time we had a `` total confrontation '' , we fought against a huge and powerful empire which was a military and industrial powerhouse with an army of 18 + millions . 
  guerilla tactics and terrorism can work when you are an occupied country and you want to push the enemy out . 
  but they 're useless when you are the minority and the enemy ca n't just walk out of the conflict . 
  the attackers are almost certainly doomed and will get killed/arrested tonight or tomorrow . 
  the truth is that all of this is just the swan song of radical islam . 
  people around the world are getting more and more educated , more and more connected with each other , more and more freethinking and more and more liberal . 
  even in countries like saudi arabia or iran , where they have to keep it secret ... for the moment . 
  that 's precisely in reaction to this that islamists rose and go more and more berserk . 
  but all they do is pushing people further away from their religion . 
  really gay weddings in mecca are a more plausible future than a global islamic caliphate . 
  it 's not putting anyone 's interests over anyone else 's . 
  it 's just the fact that if an agreement involving assad is simply not sustainable , then his side should consider finding a replacement . 
  are you saying that pro-assad syrians would never be able to be represented by * anyone * other than assad , ever ? 
  and that they would rise up against his own generals if he accepts to leave power ? 
  if he was wise and had the interest of his people in his heart he would see that by staying he only causes more trouble and makes peace difficult or even impossible , so he would have already prepared someone to be his potential successor , able to negociate a fair deal that ensures stability and peace . 
  there should n't be anything `` forced '' . 
  he 's been in power for 15 years already , is n't it enough ? 
  russia fortunately managed to stop a western intervention which would have created an even bigger mess , but now trying to keep assad personally in charge no matter what only makes the conflict linger on . 
  if he resigned in favour of one of his closest ministers or generals , the syrian government could negociate limited reforms with the opposition , stop fighting each other , and would be able to receive unambiguous help by the rest of the world against isis . 
   this is the part i do n't understand . 
  why does someone who committed acts of terrorism abroad have the right to return here ? 
  because they are citizens presumed innocent who have not been convicted nor even charged with any terrorism charge . 
  we should always be very cautious with civil rights . 
  if we give government the right to arbitrarily cancel someone 's passport ( or even citizenship ) without trial or any evidence of anything except that he traveled to some other country , then also even give them the right to `` sell '' those people to a foreign government without any concern with what will happen to them , what prevents a future government for doing the same thing to anyone who travels to tibet for instance , then ship them to china so that they can be put in a labour camp or something ? 
  you really need to have a fair trial . 
  but otherwise you 're right , this thing has been going on for long now and it seems our governments have no real other solution than `` keeping an eye on them '' . 
  i do n't doubt that our security services are working quite well ( this arrest is a proof ) but it really is technically impossible for them to properly spy on all of the wannabe jihadists . 
  so we definitely need to do more . 
  maybe obama can repay the debts then ? 
  it 's not really surprising that those who own the greek bonds are less enthusiastic about tearing them apart . 
  you ca n't blame them for that . 
  it will happen anyway , not by charity but because otherwise greece will never return to a sustainable debt level . 
  so they compared inner london to the entire \u00cele-de-france region ? 
  why not inner london vs paris , or london metro vs. \u00cele-de-france ( or paris metro ) ? 
  it 's easy to be the richest if you exclude the poorest from your stats . 
  well historically the reformation did have a very positive impact in the long term , by weakening authority , fostering debate and pushing common people to read . 
  about the biased way people remember it , i think it largely depends on the country . 
  protestant countries would of course tend to see the first reformers in a more positive light . 
  here i think it 's a bit more balanced : voltaire harshly criticized the fanaticism of both catholics and protestants . 
  as far as i know those liberal muslims do n't reject the quran , they may reject the authenticity of the hadiths , which is less of a problem theologically . 
  the quran is just interpretated based on its context .

  and they have a very low corruption rate & gov that runs decently & decent economico-social standards so little issues on that side either ( well nothing that prevent joigning the eu , they might want to address it but it 's within acceptable european standards ) . 
   bf1 is not supposed to be a history lesson , it 's a fun shooter first and foremost . 
  to be fair it 'd be like remaking the tv show `` the pacific '' ( [ from the creators of band of brothers ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_pacific_%28miniseries%29 ) ) with only the chinese and japanese and russians , and not portray in the americans and arguing that `` it 's just fiction so we do n't have to be realistic '' . 
  that 'd feel a bit pushing it . 
  oh and verdun was 1 million french soldiers casualties ( and as many germans ) . 
  portraying verdun without the french army is like stallingrad without the russians . 
  there where so many casualties in that battle it kind of traumatized society ( which led to the `` never again '' mentality that allowed the germans to run rampant at the beggining of wwii because nobody wanted to start it ), 
  the funny thing is everytime news does n't fit some people 's world view they just labelize it `` tinfoil conspiracy ! '', 
  and decide to deny reality . 
  if anyone wonders how radical governments can end up pushing country wide propaganda ; that 's how . 
  yeah right political ppl would never do that , buy the press and lie with it / s, 
   and none of yours there 's a dozen of french people that have been arrested and await trial . 
  a few russians awaits deportation back to russia too i think . 
  i think arrests where pretty fair . 
  the public discourse in medias however is pretty one sided . 
   exhibit 1 | exhibit 2 well til . 
  but as you point out the police went in pretty quickly and did it 's job correctly and autonomously ? 
   lol so you 're admitting you think the french are getting away with it because it 's their country , no , i 'm talking about the context of the ultra 's ban from the country during the euro : we can ban ppl from attending events , but it 's going to be tough to prevent them from hanging in their own streets because we wo n't assign a cop to each french citizens `` just in case of '' . 
  so if they really want to start incidents , that 'll crop up anyway , just elsewhere in the country . 
  there is n't a border checkpoint we can put and tell people `` nu uh your name is on the blacklist for a year for football violence sorry '' . 
   and you ca n't possibly detain them for months like you 've done ours ? 
  oh yes if they do something and get caught they 'll face justice all the same , or so i hope . 
  justice is ought to be blind to your appearance or origin ; and judging gravity of the actions in their context and whether it was appropriate or not in our society ( and whether you were guilty or not ofc ), 
   a murder the person did n't died . 
  thankfully , assuming that person recovers fully too ; that day is a `` near perfect '' if there is such a thing ; nobody died of the fighting at the euro , as far as i know . 
  ( unlike what happened in orlando at a simultaneous period . 
   i note you 've nothing to say about the french hooligans attacking english fans . 
  actually it 's possible they did start as much shit . 
  simply speaking : - i have no such info about the topic , but if you have , feel free to talk . 
  yeah i 'm biased by what i know , sorry - it 's gon na be tough to expulse ourselves from our own country , right ? 
  that 's why we ( frenchs ) `` only '' ( mainly ) do arrests of the most rowdy that ca n't stop when the police tell them to and break the fight, 
   this does n't require a response . 
  it 's now evident why you are such an apologist for aggressive russian behaviour . 
  what the hell . 
  let me tell you what happened there : - 1 \u00b0 ) english ultra get drunk - 2 \u00b0 ) english ultra push french passerby under metro - 3 \u00b0 ) english ultra pretend to english media that it was an english supporter pushed by frenchs or russians supporters under a metro ; a flagrant lie - 4 \u00b0 ) it appears when the person is taken to hospital that he says he 's french ( my link above ) - 5 \u00b0 ) but that 's not politically correct to have backed lies in the media right ? 
  let 's pretend it was a suicide and unrelated !, 
  victim blaming & political hypocrisy & recovering at it 's finest . 
   right , singing songs is not equivalent to having trained ultra 's following innocent fans and beating them unconscious . 
  you tell me there 's 10 english fan yelling in your ears for 5min `` we 're gon na kick your arse '' while toying with chairs , spilling your drink , tossing you and yelling you `` whatdyagonna duh uh whatdyagonna du '' and you tell me you would n't end up punching them at some point . 
   our information the accident was a suicide attempt and was not linked to violence between groups of supporters . 
  ( ... ) will you please stop blaming suicide attempts on `` everyone else '' . 
  that 's a political cover up . 
  because we hate russia for invading crimea apparently our politicians decided to twist events to blame them of english fan 's doing or at least innocent themselves . 
  i think that mob justice mentality will just get ppl killed . 
   england went from being a country where football games had to be stopped because hooligans ripped seats out of the stadium to one where it 's almost non existant . 
  yet i saw them go heckle ppl pub by pub in marseille while singing brexit or ukraine stuff just to provokate locals or russians or whoever looked tough enough . 
  so , we can either keep the political hypocrisy going and find new excuses when ppl die even after banning the russians , or we can admit several sides where guilty there  and we certainly do not have high-ranking politicians supporting football violence . 
  no , but they 're supporting 1 \u00b0 ) that * obviously * their dear supporters have nothing to do with violence and would `` never '' do that 2 \u00b0 ) let 's blame russia and ignore the real problem for cheap political points ( 3 \u00b0 ) then obviously that mp that encouraged it the other day is a morron but i digress , it 's just as bad from the english to say they 're 100 % innocent of that ), 
  i know hating the russians is the way to go right now , but that 's only part of the problem : if the english do n't stop provoking people at random either and just blame russian supporters for everything ; they 'll just get somebody else killed , russians or no russians . 
  they had drunkenly pushed somebody under a metro in marseille the other day remember ? 
  then they promptly blamed it on everyone else . 
  then political cover up smh http://www.lequipe.fr/football/actualites/la-prefecture-dement-la-rumeur-d-un-supporter-anglais-tue-dans-le-metro-de-marseille/693694 so either the englishs admit they got a problem with football violence too instead of just yelling `` russians ! '', 
  ; and actually address it too ; or the problem wo n't go anywhere, 
   and with `` crazy '' you mean known , convicted jihadist recruiter , right ? 
  since when one does preclude the other ? 
  breivik was a fringe right wing recruiter and batshit crazy . 
  \\  tl ; dr : crazy yelled `` allahu ackbar '' , knifed an out of duty french police officer & his wife . 
  got killed by police reinforcements . 
   the 150 russian football supporters `` were well prepared for ultra-rapid , ultra-violent action '' and were able to evade arrest , a city prosecutor said . 
  translation : drunk football fans do n't hesitate a split second before punching back anyone surprized here ? 
  haha  an england fan , who is in an induced coma with severe brain injuries admittedly ok that one cross the line, 
  hiv already exists in europe . 
  the reason it 's so high in russia and some other countries ( ukraine ? ), 
  is due to rampant drug abuse with reused needles , widespread prostitution for food and base needs , and ppl that ca n't afford common early or later treatments that could reduce a lot of cases . 
  ie solve poverty and social despair pacifically if you want to solve that one . 
  yeah , they could be eu one day . 
  after rebuilding ( investment , rebuilding of social services , new utilities , etc etc ) and decorruption on the scale of poland tho . 
  and it 's not going to happen any time soon . 
  think 20 years mini , after that ukraine story . 
  nobody 's denying the russians ' / soviets ' sacrifices during wwii . 
  but that does not excuse country-wide oligarchic plundering , routine assassinations , unpaid teachers , collapsing healthcare , having an economy that works on oil only or invading ukraine . 
  it 's going to be very unpopular for the russians to hear us says so , but ppl are still giving us a lot of crap for letting romania ( and others ) joigning before addressing it 's problems . 
  yes russia is a major power ( and romania never was since constantinople became istanbul ) , but they 're badly damaged from the inside . 
  probably on the same scale . 
  the country possibly never recovered from the cold war 's damages imho ( and i do n't mean `` the loss of territory of the ussr '' , i mean even all the shit that disappeared during the 90 like the abandonned infrastructure everywhere well within russian lands or the deep poverty ) . 
  regardless of the cause , the country will have to recover first and it 's population to have less trouble with daily life before they be able to decide whether they wants to join the eu . 
  and posturing will somehow have to stop from both sides of the old cold war too ( this ai n't going to be easy after invading crimea , few people trust the country after that land grab ) . 
   but they have somewhere to live , have access to clean water , have clothes , can afford to buy food etc ? 
  it 's not poverty you 're talking about , it 's relative poverty . 
  i 'm sorry but everytime that somebody answer that `` there is no poverty in europe because you can afford food and clothes and water '' i want to start punching people . 
  jesus christ , this is n't a `` miracle '' . 
  this is n't wealth . 
  this is fucking basic standards that existed even during the roman era , that is 2000 years ago . 
  and we 're considering this * wealth * now ? 
  fuck this logic . 
   gets arrested at airport well you already have the tsa that makes you feel like a criminal under arrest every time you get close to an us airport so  . , 
  so are we talking about isis twitterios that advocate & apologize for terrorist bombings ; or are we talking about people that where just drunk & stupid ? 
   well switching to electic cars would increase energy demand significantly . 
  norway would probably need to open a couple of factories or a couple of large fields windmills to meet the demand . 
  2025 as deadline is pretty ambitious . 
  a very common but false belief : - car consumption would remain nearly insignificant next to industrial & business use . 
  a few mere % of the power grid at worse - if you charge it at mostly night ( by plugging when you commute back ) you do n't need anything more , since the power consumption is significantly lower at night anyway but you do n't demolish powerplants everynight so they generally mass idle . 
  i 'm kindah surprized it took them that long to yell `` litterally hitler ! '', 
  something we see from time to time with war casualties . 
  the brain is sometime rebuilding following curious ways along curious patterns after massive damage that otherwise left the original zones fubar . 
  guess that brain used `` french '' patterns ( or likely what the guy perceived as such ) to fill in \\* shrugs \\* ( albeit somebody might have watched too much action movies haha ), 
  hey that looks like the highway in boston in fallout 4 :d, 
   he looks like palpatine in his senator form , http://lenachan.eu/b/src/1440280280279.jpg  and he 's almost ready to turn into an evil sith dictator and conquer europe . 
  a bit late for that , he 's already in charge :d, 
  something i would agree with ; and somehow following the release of the rest of the prisonners in russia,

  just see all the recents terrorist attacks in france involving a knife , not enough ? 
  you want easy access to guns , you sure ? 
  lol always the same bullshit excuse . 
  `` they ca n't defend themselves '' where are the people with guns in the us during mass shooting or terrorist attacks ? 
  if one guy come with a ar-15 in a night club like the orlando attack nobody can grab his gun and kill the terrorist ( because they do n't carry their gun ) but on the other side a terrorist can acquire easily a fucking ar-15 rifle . 
  since when hard law on guns means no more guns ? 
  dcns not happy, 
  in france the commando marine are special forces , only 650 members . 
  so 99 % sure it was not a commando here but a soldier from the regular army . 
  ask your friend because i 'm done with you . 
  i was first reffering to your post mentioning it was a commando but a fusilier marin is not a commando forfusco = 2300 members commandos marines = 650 members so all the members in forfusco are not commando . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fusiliers_marins i do n't understand what you trying to say because there is nothing difficult here . 
  you need to read again , they support them but are not commandos . 
  this is not difficult to understand ... 
  it 's not the same . 
   the fusiliers marins and commandos marine units are under command of the force maritime des fusiliers marins et commandos ( forfusco ) in lorient nothing here is hard to understand . 
  it 's not the same unit but they 're both part of the `` forfusco '' https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/commando_marine and i 'm almost sure the commandos do n't participate in the operation sentinelle . 
  the fusilliers marins are not commandos . 
  source of this ? 
  the commando marine are part of the special forces ( cos ; `` special operations command '' ) so i 'm a bit skeptical about your comment . 
  not the first time a guy attack the police or a soldier with only a knife and some still say that the hard law on guns are useless ... yeah sure . 
  last year or in 2015 a guy was shot dead for the same reason by the police in france . 
  a commando doing a sentinelle misision ? 
  i doubt it . 
   polls are not perfect in france they 're ok and with the actual voting system ( 2 rounds and popular vote ) no chance for her . 
  if you care about climate change you do n't close the nuclear plants by 2035 ... 
  the f-35b is less good than the f-35c or f-35a and still have a lot of problems . 
  you will be stuck with the f35b while we have the rafale on our carrier . 
  the french carrier can carry longer missions with fully loaded aircraft unlike stovl ... so no it 's not equal but it 's cheaper . 
  catobar is a better system it 's a fact not my opinion . 
   it was also announced that the operational carrier would have catapult and arrestor gear ( catobar ) installed to accommodate the carrier variant of the joint strike fighter rather than the short-take off and vertical-landing version . 
   the decision to convert prince of wales to catobar was reviewed after the projected costs rose to around double the original estimate . 
  on 10 may 2012 , the defence secretary , philip hammond , announced in parliament that the government had decided to revert to its predecessor 's plans to purchase the f-35b rather than the f-35c , and to complete both aircraft carriers with ski-jumps in the stovl configuration . 
   two supercarriers ___ one carrier bigger but your carriers will use the stovl configuration ... catobar configuration is better ( used on the french charles de gaulle carrier ) . 
  so even if your carrier is bigger , the french one will be better but having two of them is better than one i agree because when our carrier is in maintenance we do n't have another ...

   they 're all comparatively rich countries with high gdp per capita it does not mean they have a good healthcare system ... ( the us is a great example for that . ), 
   whereas no bias in favour of any health system was alleged , the index was criticised in the british medical journal by martin mckee and others from the european observatory on health systems and policies in february 2016 . 
  points they made included : - the index is constructed by scoring performance as good , intermediary or not-so-good , based on arbitrary cut-off points . 
  - there is no logic in how many points are allocated to each indicator . 
  225 points are allocated to accessibility , but only 250 to health outcomes . 
  - the indicators are a mix of trends over time and cross-sectional rankings . 
  it can make a lot of difference i agree but our economy or our health care system did n't fall down since then , it 's pretty stable . 
  and i read a lot of positive things from foreigners on it . 
  i would rather trust the the world health organization even if the report is a bit old now and need an update . 
  i just found this : http://blogs.bmj.com/bmj/2016/02/09/what-if-anything-does-the-eurohealth-consumer-index-actually-tell-us/ well ok i have my answer now !, 
  i 'm french , but it 's me of france is low compared to some countries ? 
  is this really a reliable report ? 
  not even in the top 10 ... in europe in 2000 the world health organization found that france provided the `` close to best overall health care '' in the world . 
  i do n't think in 16 years we went down so low . 
   health consumer powerhouse is a swedish health policy think tank which specialises in comparing healthcare systems throughout europe . 
  it produces the euro health consumer index and other indexes comparing healthcare . 
  it was created in 2004 by johan hjertqvist , a swedish entrepreneur , author and former local politician . 
  it has offices in stockholm , sweden . 
  [ 1 ] dr arne a bj\u00f6rnberg is the president of the company . 
  he was formerly chief executive of the swedish national pharmacy corporation .

  it was in a velodrome so it 's more easy , 
   comes from the fine particles emitted by diesel engines in cities . 
  not totally true . 
  vehicles are responsible for a small portion . 
  wood-heating pollue as much as cars for example . 
  i would say nuclear is a solution for a long term ... and the only one with renewable energies . 
  we 're building new nuclear reactors at the moment , these should be way more safer but it 's not cheap ... the problem is the not about the safety etc. . but the cost . 
  ( maintenance , price of the new reactors ), 
  wow champagne !, 
  hahaha it was great, 
  hahaha, 
  all us mass shooting in school or the orlando nightclub shooting ? 
  guns do n't keep you more safe ... i 'm french and i can give you dozens of examples of terrorists/criminals who have difficulty obtaining guns and then got arrested or failed to kill someone because of that . 
  easy access to guns would be a huge problem atm in france because of the terror risks . 
  a large part of the murders in europe are from gangs too ... and if do n't go to the shitty parts of the city you 're fine like in the us . 
  but unlike the us , the mass shooting in school etc. . . are very very rare in europe . 
  only the terrorist attacks and the risk on an terror attack are quite similar atm in the us and in the western europe . 
  read some stats on marseille ( france 's crime capital ) , most of the murders are from drug dealers like in the us . 
   how so lol france ( 67 ) + belgium ( 4 ) + switzerland ( 2 ) + canada ( 8 ) = 81m + https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/african_french, 
  it 's your opinion , maybe not the truth . 
  the ranking is not only based on economy or number of people who speak the language and this why french still ahead of spanish . 
   - french is both a working language and an official language of the united nations , the european union , unesco , nato , the international olympic committee , the international red cross and international courts . 
  french is the language of the three cities where the eu institutions are headquartered : strasbourg , brussels and luxembourg . 
   - more than 220 million people speak french on all the five continents . 
  french is a major language of international communication . 
  it is the second most widely learned language after english and the sixth most widely spoken language in the world . 
  french is also the second most widely taught language after english , and is taught on every continent . 
  the oif , an international organisation of french-speaking countries , is made up of 77 member states and governments . 
  france also operates the biggest international network of cultural institutes , which run french-language course for close on a million learners . 
   - a study conducted by bloomberg in 2011 , which showed french to be the third most useful language for conducting business around the world , after english and mandarin . 
   - france and the french-speaking countries play an active part in the world economy , accounting for some 20 % of world trade in goods . 
   - french is europe 's second most widely spoken mother tongue with over 77 million speakers , after germany ( around 100 million ) but ahead of english ( around 61 million ) . 
  demographers forecast that france 's birth rate will make french the most widely spoken mother tongue in europe , ousting german , by 2025 . 
  french is an official language of 29 countries , second only to english in this category . 
   - the oif estimates that the number of french speakers will rise to over 700 million by 2050, 
  french is way more important in europe ( france/belgium/switzerland vs spain ) and it 's an essential language in africa so it make sense . 
  both languages will be more important in the future due to the development of africa and south america tought . 
  because your comment is funny ? 
  yes it 's what i mean, 
  https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/financement_des_campagnes_pr%c3%a9sidentielles_en_france#2012 d\u00e9penses = expenditure remboursement = refund they ca n't spend some crazy amount during the campaign , there is a limit . 
  in 2012 it was 22\u00a0509\u00a0000 $ . 
  the french governement refund you 50 % of your campaign expenditure if during the election you got more than 5 % , so the fn will have the money to pay back the bank . 
  the problem is just `` they are the fn . '',

  the goal and the missions of the french army , settled by the government or the assembly is more or less ( a bit less , i 'll give you that ) in accord with it 's funding and equipment . 
  outside of our territory , we except our army to engage herself in peace keeping operations , preferably in a un coalition context . 
  we do not except her , at the moment , to be able to bomb the shit out of a country during months or to be able to invade let 's say irak in order to overthrow it 's government by herself . 
  `` the mission of the armed forces is envisaged over a short period , from several weeks to several months . '', 
  ( white paper on defence and national security ) and according to the wp article posted before this discussion it is question of over 800 strikes in a month , it 's not something that we do every year you know , carrying over 800 strikes in a one month period . 
  1940 * :d . but my point still stand imo , germany did n't become a war machine in two days , nazy party came to power in 1933 , rhineland was remilitarized in 1936 ( and with it came the siegfried line which made an offensive from france more difficult ) , then anschluss and munich agreement happened in 1938 . 
  we had time to stop hitler , france did n't need to be in full war mode from 1918 to 1935 `` just in case '' but we iniated a massive rearmament in 1936 when things smelled bad so we were more ready than during the 20 's . 
  we played poorly and did n't figured how to combine arms as effectively as the germans but it does n't mean we did nothing when germany began to be a serious threat and it will be the same if any country begin to be one . 
  and btw the allies had more tanks and artillery than the germans during the invasion of western europe . 
  did n't stop germany to win this round , so reading comments about how not having enough bombs to carpet bombing lybia is a disgrace or whatever is amusing . 
  i think pumping money into research is more effective than pumping money into making bombs that will sit in a hangar so we can bomb fucking lybia all by ourself if the need arise . 
  what would be the point ? 
  be capable of saying ` ho yes , we tripled our stock of bombs but now we can bomb lybia without help , france is strong stop surrender jokes pls ' ? 
  it 's plain dumb imo . 
  if an all out war happens , we know damn well that every fucking human being and every factory in the country will contribute to the war effort and our productivity of ammunitions will be over the roof . 
  i would assume it 's because we have no countries who threaten us , wtf would we have enough bombs to sustain a war against say russia right now ? 
  waste of money and ressources if you ask me . 
  but if europe takes the path of war i assume our stockpile will be of another dimension . 
  war between major forces will not come suddenly , it 's not like putin will wake up tomorrow and decide that he 's in the mood for ww3 , if there 's war in the air i think we will be more ready . 
  that 's what is mind blowing , they raised their concerns in sept 2015 but nobody gave a shit . 
  if the population of wallonia have concerns about ceta , the parliament should n't agree to ratify it but express why they are against it to see if a common ground is possible . 
  and that 's what they do but some people are going crazy on this sub when democracy is working as intended . 
  rofl , as if they could have any significant effects yet especially since some parts of it will not be effective before 2017 . 
  well i have my harpoon in the trunk of the car during summer ... and if it 's a small beach ( with rocks and shit nearby ) it 's perfectly reasonnable to bring it . 
  the probl\u00e8me is to use it against people , it 's not personot very civilized . 
  maybe it 's true but i think he just invented the numbers . 
  and since i live in marseille i can tell you : it 's not that bad , most of the time they are even friendly . 
  yes , the guy who sell fruits in my street is doing his 5 prayers per day but he have a french flag in his shop since the euro so it 's ok i guess . 
  my friends always say these two , they are not awkard when you are used to it but the first time i was a bit surprised , it 's like when they say salam instead of bonjour when the pizza guy is arab . 
  well to be honest if i voted for a guy and a coup was on going i will not stay still . 
  maybe not ready to die but i would probably be in the streets . 
  if your cheese do n't stink it 's not cheese bro . 
  you have no idea what you talking about , i do n't deny that we do have a problem but do n't think that there is some guys waiting to beat the shit out of you and steal you at every corner . 
  lived in marseille my whole life , never had a problem , do n't be a dick and nobody will give a fuck about you . 
  if you end up in an argument do n't escalate things , do n't be a cowboy , be calm and it will be ended in 3 min max , even with the so feared french-arab people . 
  i do n't deny that people can be agressive here , but it 's not a french-arab thing only ... and right now it 's ramadan so most of those who are outside by 10pm just wants to drink coffee and play cards after dining with their family ... brrrrr . 
  i also have the impression that they are always 10 minimum ... 
  i 'll vote for my ideas , thank you very much . 
  if fillon go to the 2nd round i 'll abstain . 
  ( not sure about macron ) if the sole argument for me to vote in the second turn is `` muhhh fn '' then fuck it . 
  neither fillon or le pen deserves my vote and i 'm tired of voting against my ideas . 
  the fn is used to secure the 2nd turn of many elections but nothing is done to stop their rise . 
  fuck it , we 'll reap what we have sown . 
  i 'll give you one fine tip : when eric ciotti try to say something just do n't listen to him or try to process what he 's trying to say , it 's useless and most of the time he 's full of shit . 
  it 's never black and white but we certainly have a part of responsability . 
  how the fuck do you want a son of immigrant stuck in a banlieux with no futur to react when he learns about things like la folie in nanterre ( a slum of 20 hectares where we dumped working immigrants we imported to re build our country ) ? 
  i would have nothing but anger toward this country who put himself so high , who talk about human right or morality but treated my parents or grand-parents like shit . 
  it 's not self shaming , it 's acknowledging what we have done , we imported them to rebuild the country without planning or thinking about how we wanted things to go and we treated them like shit . 
  end of the story , now can we move forward ? 
  `` it has failed '' . 
  no it has not . 
  i count some of them as my friends and they deserves every fucking piece of their citizenship and i want them by my sides in this country . 
  i do n't say we do n't have problem of integrations , but we also have sucess and we must not be bigotted idiot , it would be as dumb as being the opposite ( that i think ) you despise so much . 
  again , things are never black and white . 
  it 's not it has worked or it has failed . 
  it 's both . 
  the fear of the populist electorate are legitimate and i even share them to a certain degree ( no , france will not collapse in 2 years ffs ) but the easy answer which consist of saying `` fuckin muslims who do n't integrate let 's spit our hate on em and throw pork sausage at them so they know it 's france , country of wine and charcuterie '' will achieve nothing . 
  never worked and never will . 
  and i 'm always fucking impressed how the few sons or grand-sons of harkis i know ( one of them is one of my best friend so we talked a bit about that , it 's still a touchy subject in their families ) are chill about the way we treated them ( for those who do n't know , we parked them in camps for 15 years guarded by military police with shit like curfew ) and how well integrated they are . 
  i have nothing but respect for them for how they approach their history , time is great healer i guess but still . 
  building reactors now would be dumb , that is clear . 
  it would be cool but dumb ( i love dem neutrons splitting shit , what can i say ) the window for nuclear energy is over but i 'm just saying that we could have done much more , that the field of possibility was much larger than what we have explored and we could have prevented a lot of future problem if we ( and by we it 's the west , france did his part imo ) had decided to do so instead of going full retard with fossil energies ( but it was too good to be ignored i guess ) . 
  we did not and i 'm all for closing the chapter of nuclear energy , it was fucking glorious but it 's coming to an end . 
  well , the chapter is far from over because decomissioning will take at least 50years . 
  maybe more . 
  and it 's so late i need to sleep , good night man . 
  i dont suggest anything because it 's too late for this discussion anyway . 
  renewable energies are coming and the development of the next gen is stopped . 
  the epr is just an improvement of our current rpw and we dont even know if it will be working one day . 
  what i 'm saying is nuclear energy could have been the bridge between fossil energies and renewables energy , at least for us the rich part of this world . 
  it 's too late for that and we will fill the remaining years with fossil energies , increasing the odds of a really painfull climate change . 
  we played badly if you ask me but i know it is easy to say it after the fact . 
  yes but it 's a bit late for that . 
  we have a big problem coming at us in france for example . 
  the firsts pwr we built do n't have much years left , the epr is far from ready , areva is in deepshit and since super ph\u00e9nix is dead we ca n't bet on a 4th gen coming anytime soon . 
  and there 's no political will to go for another 30-50 years of nuclear . 
  ca n't blame them tho , money is tight , people are skeptical and launching the development of a new park while handling the decomissionng of the old one would be a money sink and a nightmare . 
  just for this winter edf was forced to close a lot of reactors for inspection and this will be tight . 
  basically , we will have a void where we do n't have enough nuclear energy anymore while renewable energies are not fully ready to sustain our consumption yet . 
  it will be a fun ride , our electricity is cheap for now but in a few years ... 
  and i 'm interested in hearing how you deal with an auto sustained climate change when we dont even know what the impact of an ice-sea free summer ( projected for ~ 2030 ) in north pole will really be on global climate . 
  who knows where we could be if we kept invested in nuclear ? 
  it would n't be perfect but things like fast neutrons reactors produce less wastes for exemple . 
  i wo n't bother you with the details but its significant . 
  sure right now it can be nasty ( sodium or lead use can go badly ) but again , we dont know where we could be . 
  we are also capable of re using the plutonium created in the reactors and the non fissile uranium ( instead of 8 units of uox wastes you now have one unit of mox waste ) and we could be more efficient , like recycling the mox for another cycle . 
  but we chose not to . 
  and finally , no industrial process is safe so chose your poison . 
  but as i said earlier in this thread it 's a bit late for that so ... as someone who will certainly work in this field , i 'll just specialize in decommissioning but i think it 's a bit underwhelming . 
  we put so much in this technology but we 'll just keep some reactors to be sure we can bomb each other if the need arise . 
  nah she wo n't have the parliament . 
  right now fn have like 3 or 4 deputies and 0 senators and i doubt fn would get more if she wins , they dont have enough presence at a local level , especially since parties usually call for voting against the fn in the second round no matter who is against them . 
  and i can imagine both les r\u00e9publicains and ps making a stand against her in the assembly . 
  she would be able to do some stuff but not that much imo . 
  check jean lasalle altough idk if there 's a lot of stuff in english about him . 
  idk about that , the turks i know here ( marseille ) are either kurds or just do n't give af and are not really religious - ie drink alcohol and do n't observe ramadan - . 
  they ca n't really write in decent french but are hardworking and integrated enough and their childs are as french as i 'm . 
  and tbh sometimes they say some shit that would make the fn jealous and i 'm all ` wtf did kessi just said ? 
  does he know he 's also tanned ? 
  i may inform him about that ' .

  it 's a major issue for the oc because they literally might not have candidates at all in the near future , especially for the winter olympics . 
  [ an article from 2016 talking about the issue . 
  ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/jul/27/biggest-threat-future-olympic-games-rio-2016-ioc-thomas-bach-hosts ), 
  the olympic committee has no choice , los angeles and paris are the only candidates and all the other folded . 
  you 're welcome . 
  the irony is that the person i downvoted the most in this sub is also romanian .

  come closer portubro !, 
  you 're boosting your ass off !, 
  yeah that 's a nice poll and all but it 's rather meaningless , especially when you look at what people actually vote for in concrete terms . 
  look at france where supposedly a majority favours a federation ( quite a lot has changed since 2013 by the way ) , at the last presidential elections anti-eu candidates ( le pen , m\u00e9lenchon , dupont-aignan to name the main ones ) got over 45 % of the vote in the first round . 
  those are people who openly dislike the eu , either want to leave it right away ( dupont-aignan and le pen ) or completely transform it and leave it if it does n't work ( m\u00e9lenchon ) . 
  federation is not even in question because it just sounds like a ludicrous idea right now . 
  even pro-european politicians do n't dare using the word ` federation ' as it has such a negative connotation now . 
   continental eu countries , especially those who have been in the eu since the off , almost have a nationality of the eu now ; the younger generation especially . 
  and i 'm saying it as a rather pro-eu young person . 
   the federalists also , are basically eu first now , to coin a trump phrase . 
  there are like 150 federalists in europe . 
  and 147 of them are in this subreddit , thinking they have large support for their cause . 
  they do n't . 
  do n't know what that is , but you could probably find one somewhere near the canadian ambassy desperately looking for a tree to cut down or a bear to fight .

  why the hell a professional politician would refuse the sit of the prime minister of the uk in one of the most challenging chapter in modern history ? 
  a war has an ultimate goal , this goal ( kicking communists out ) was n't achieved in vietnam . 
  the goal of the iraq war was to successfully invade , take control and remove saddam . 
  that was achieved . 
  this is why your point is false , the us invests plenty of money into healthcare , more than any other country as percentage of gdp . 
  their system is just piss-poor like your points , and that money mostly goes to big pharma , but that 's another question . 
   this is not just my opinion , it 's a fact . 
  the war in iraq was not a war , it was an invasion based on a false pretext . 
  they found no chemical weapons . 
  it 's like saying the battle of verdun is not war , it 's just a battle . 
  this is literally the first line of your wiki article :  the 2003 invasion of iraq lasted from 20 march to 1 may 2003 and ** signalled the start of the iraq war ** you ca n't be this dumb ... `` reached the bottom but keep digging '' as we say . 
   this was my point . 
  your point was :  they invest a lot of money into the military while almost completely ignoring healthcare . 
  you talked about money . 
  never about service . 
  the us spends the most money . 
  your point is bullshit and you 're just moving the goalpost . 
   it was based on the false premise that iraq had chemical weapons . 
  they did n't find any . 
  it was n't a war , it was an invasion that led to the creation of modern terrorist organizations . 
  so now the false political reason behind iraq is relevant to evaluate the military operation . 
  and that was n't even a war ... lol . 
  i flagged you a while ago as a `` troll '' , i see i was already right back then . 
  piss poor . 
  he explained why your point about the us healthcare spending is bullshit , then you answer by saying ( in bold , because you know he 's right ) the services suck which he never denied and he even acknowledged . 
  then you suggest the us has n't won a war citing vietnam and irak . 
  while the former is true , the latter is blatantly false . 
  irak ( first or second war ) was a total military success , like afghanistan . 
  the country was completely controlled by the us and its allies , saddam captured and hanged as well as pretty much all the high-ranking members of his administration . 
  a pro-us leader was given the country . 
  but you 're mixing up war and the politics put in place afterwards , so i 'm not really surprised you 're confused . 
   the iranian revolution from the 70s , that led to the creation of islamist extremist states , was sponsored and supported by the us . 
  it 's the shah that was supported by the us , the one overthrown by the revolution . 
  do you even know how to read ? 
  how can someone be so ignorant to state that the iranian revolution was sponsored and supported by the us ? 
  this is honestly mind-blowing . 
  so you did n't read the article i linked , i 'm not surprised . 
   the problem is the extension of it while rest of europe is diversifying through lng . 
  you know who else is diversifying through lng ? 
  [ russia , who 's set to become the largest lng exporter withing a few years .

   one of those countries is currently expanding its pipeline to russia we need gas as much as russia needs the money that europe pays for it . 
  actually no , russia is much , much more dependent on european money since their economy is shit and gas is pretty much the only thing that keeps it alive . 
   while another was selling warships during the crimean farce . 
  i think you meant cancel a decade old contract worth billions . 
  dude , none of my female friends would do that either it 's just anecdotal evidence . 
  does n't change the fact that since the dawn of time when we were cavemen , the chief of the tribe would get more women . 
  that does n't mean all women or even a majority of women would fall for a guy with power , but there are plenty of them . 
  i can guarentee you that any country leader receives dozens of letters everyday of women ready to do anything for them . 
  ok i get your point , i was more thinking about any woman attracted by power . 
  well historically , leaders from czech republic or france or indonesia simply attract women . 
  this is what power does . 
  that 's because he is hot for * politics * standards . 
  when you know that a chubby guy who looks like shit like hollande can pretty much bang any woman , imagine a guy like macron . 
  no , that 's exporting freeeeeeeeeeeeedom ^ ^ tm, 
  no , there are dozens of countries with cheaper labour than china . 
  yet they struggle to compete with it , simply because they do n't have the infrastructures , supply chain , etc. . . you want to start your business and sell glasses ? 
  go to danyang , here in this factory you 'll find the best quality . 
  oh sorry , you want to sell cheap crappy glasses , i did n't get it . 
  well , just cross the street and you 'll get what you want in this other factory . 
  you changed your mind and want to sell smartphones now ? 
  cool , just hop on a plane to shenzen and decide on your way there if you want to compete with the latest iphone or this new crappy phone under 100 $ .

  this is ridiculous . 
  anybody can potentially become a french citizen . 
  you do n't need to be born in france to be one and you do n't need to be born in france to be president . 
  do they have different rights to normal people ? 
  yes . 
  do they have those rights only because of the family they were born into ? 
  yes . 
  kudos to the spaniards protesting . 
  let 's remember the universal declaration of human rights , whose first article states :  all human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights . 
  equal in rights means you can not be in power just because you were born in a certain family . 
  us french are very critical of everything , so i am not surprised people are critical of the french system . 
  there certainly are issues with the french system , but since it 's been classified by who and others as one of the best 3 systems in the world , the results in this study do not make any sense . 
  thanks , i could not find it . 
  i am starting to read it now and i am extremely surprised to say the least . 
  france is marked as 10 ( us at 11 ) when it comes to `` paying '' . 
  for god sake , it 's virtually free in france . 
  how can we possibly be that bad !, 
  11 ( the worst ) for waiting time to receive treatment !, 
  i have never heard of waiting times in france . 
  i recently got surgery and it went like this : got appointment with surgeon in 2 days , surgery 3 days later ( including the weekend ) . 
  note that i never saw a bill . 
  for me , it looks like they inverted the numbers for france , it just does not make sense . 
  weird that who classified france as number one ( a few years ago ) and now france has one of the worst systems ? 
  i used to live in the england in the 90s and the nhs was scary back then . 
  i am happy it has improved . 
  we do n't all have natural gas , on the other hands the netherlands is ( one of ) the largest co2 producer per capita in europe . 
  edit : corrected, 
  no it is not . 
  france and the uk are rather similar in terms of military forces , missiles , submarines , ... 
  i do n't like cheese or red wine . 
  i seem to recall that a few years ago bribery of foreign officials was tax deductible in france . 
  obviously it was not labelled `` bribes '' . 
  if a professor of human nutrition says '' it brings in vegetables in the form of salad '' , i tend to think that he 's either misquoted or not a professor . 
  salad , in itself , has very little nutritional value and certainly less than vegetables . 
  i guess a lot of the quality of the air has to do with wind . 
  many cities from the west coast of europe receive a good daily dose of fresh air from the atlantic . 
  oh yes . 
  i can not recall the exact proportions , but there is a european quota and a lower french quota for music on the radio . 
  surprisingly , this also applies to movies on the telly , be it live , or vod , or even via subscriptions such as netflix . 
  on top of that , you have very strict laws on when a movie can be shown : on vod , tv , dvds , and subscription-based systems . 
  it 's a loooong time after cinema release , and totally unsuitable for netflix . 
  you mean wind power ? 
  do n't underestimate the power of protests in france . 
  you exaggerate a little but i get your point . 
  the issue in france is the extremely strict laws regarding what can be seen on different media , and in which language . 
  it 's a total clusterfuck and last thing i read about this , netflix was saying to the french government that they will base their broadcast from luxembourg to avoid all french laws . 
  i really , really hope they do it . 
  last year i spent a few weeks with my kids in the usa and netflix kids was amazing . 
  just for that , i 'd like to get it in france . 
  the same is true for france with the cnrs . 
  i was confronted to this in the netherlands too . 
  i could not put petrol in my car with an international credit card at he station i stopped to . 
  this is really stupid . 
   you want magic technologic toys to clean up your mess instead of acting like an adult and use the existing technology responsibly . 
  i am acting as a human being and seeking progress to correct the errors of the past . 
  i do n't want to act like a scared ape taking refuge in a cave , afraid of lightnings . 
   you can call back when the magical toys have arrived . 
  until then , we 've got a planet to maintain . 
  ~ ~ magical ~ ~ scientific new toys arrive all the time . 
  it 's call progress . 
  you want to live like the amish . 
  i want to live in the star trek universe . 
   if you 're looking into your crystal ball anyway you might as well give us the plans already so we can see what they 're really worth . 
  until then , there 's no room for sky pie in the limited budget . 
   the greens are fucking barbarians . 
  any sort of scientific progress is a threat for you . 
  you want us all to go back to living in caves . 
  instead of promoting a less polluted world with the help of science , you just want everyone to live the wonderful time of the middle age . 
  i have heard dutch people use [ drs. 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/doctorandus ) which means someone with a degree . 
  it always made me laugh . 
  the alstom story could mean that a new european train maker rises , as a mix of alstom train division and siemens ' . 
  nobody 's mentioned erwtensoep from the netherlands . 
  it 's a delicious pea thick soup with sausages and stuff . 
  must be homemade , since i never had a good one in a restaurant . 
  no , it 's purely factual . 
  everyone here seems to be thinking of older children . 
  what 's happening in day care and pre-school ( maternelle ) is different because children do not have a choice , and understandably so . 
  when my son was in daycare , there was no pork on the menu . 
  then the head of daycare changed and pork was reintroduced . 
  this is not the case at my son 's school . 
  i meant as a weight measure . 
  as a word for @ , yes it is still used . 
  it 's not used in france anymore , or at least i have never heard it . 
  the french word `` arobase '' comes from a measure of weight . 
  by 2015 : does it mean before jan 1st 2015 or before dec 31st 2015 ? 
  some recent survey gave the right 22 % , the front national 20 % . 
  with the current dislike of politicians and the scandals on all sides , but especially about the right , it 's inevitable that many will chose the populist option . 
  it 's not historic since they had a bit of success a few years previously in local elections too . 
  what seems to be going on is a huge historic success in the european elections in a few weeks . 
  that will be massive . 
  i am appalled , but they will be the first french party in the new eu elections . 
  it describes france too . 
  i think most people are in denial , all over europe and all over the world . 
  coming from a dutch person , it 's hilarious , considering [ this ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/double_irish_arrangement#dutch_sandwich ) is the biggest tax evasion scheme in europe . 
  similarly in france , the front national would be at 20 % , just behind the top party ( ump ) at 22 % . 
  those polls depress me . 
  especially in light of the recent news of paris pollution . 
  the french media were keen to mention that part of the parisian pollution was due to german coal burning power plants . 
  so the nuklear nein danke was not good for france ( on several levels ) .

  journalists are almost never allowed in combat areas , it 's nearly impossible to make a documentary like [ restrepo ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1559549/ ) for example . 
  so , most informations come directly from the high command and it 's very hard for the press to cross-check them . 
  not that other countries like the us let reporters roam freely around , but they are definitely more lax . 
  incidentally , we have less details on what exactly is done and when they are actually hiding stuff . 
  you looked pretty damn serious to me . 
  poland is the 5th biggest european country with the 5th biggest population . 
  it 's absolutely not a small country for europe , it 's a major one . 
  and they have plenty of mountains . 
  not sure what you tried to explain by that . 
  yeah , let 's rewrite history , shall we ? 
  we got invaded by germany , we fought and lost , we surrendered . 
  that 's history , it happened and i have no problem with that . 
  there is no point in trying to argue against it , so i 'd rather move on . 
  now you do n't see french people going around and mocking poles for being literally butt-fucked by germany then russia for decades , so why do n't you get some sense of decency and keep quiet about these kind of jokes ? 
  yeah , you guys are all heroes who fought so well to the end , and the french gave up without a fight blablabla . 
  i do n't really mind this american joke , sometimes it can be even funny , but i 'm honestly puzzled when it comes from people whose countries have basically been the bitch of others for decades . 
   but the uk undoubtly has more power projection than the french . 
  again , i gave you all the elements to explain why the uk can virtually do nothing without an aircraft carrier . 
  you can not move any of your fighter jets without france or the us giving you a spot on theirs . 
  you can not bomb any countries without the help of france or the us . 
  you can not have air support for your troops on the ground without the help of france or the us . 
  you will in a few years , when your aircraft carrier will be delivered . 
  sorry but global firepower is a bullshit source . 
  the uk and france have roughly the same defence budgets and military power . 
  except for the aircraft carrier , that completely put france ahead of the uk for projection power . 
  seriously , ask any military expert he will tell you the same . 
   you guys very rarely act on the world stage as you are so tied down to the eu and you are incapable of acting independently of germany . 
  ok , you seriously do n't read any news or what ? 
  france was acting alone in mali ( with a little logistical help from the us ) , was the biggest contributor in lybia , has been bombing syria for a while whereas the uk only voted to join a couple months ago . 
  what the fuck are you talking about ? 
  and about your bullshit claim about british cultural superiority . 
  lol , i lived in london for a while , never heard such non-sense . 
  it 's 2016 , britain and france are old countries who used to have big colonial empires , but these days are long gone . 
  your ex-colony india is buying for billions $ of rafale french-made jet fighters , not british eurofigters because they do n't give a crap about your supposed `` special relationship '' . 
  we live in a globalised world , commonwealth countries do n't look up to you and wo n't die for you anymore . 
  and five eyes seriously ? 
  france has a mass-surveillance system as well , and that 's not a fucking thing to brag about . 
  but if you get a boner because your government plus 4 others are monitoring what you do , good for you . 
  edit : spelling, 
  lol , i thought only americans were as delusionals as this . 
  [ the uk wo n't have an operational aircraft carrier before 2020 ** at best ** . 
  ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/defence/9117367/navy-aircraft-carrier-plans-hit-by-further-delays.html ) right now , british pilots * learn french * to work on the charles de gaulle aircraft carrier because guess what ? 
  they 're stuck in britain otherwise . 
   work is already underway , with british pilots learning french in preparation for deployment on france 's aircraft carrier . 
  have a fun read mate , reality can be hard sometimes . 
  what the hell are you talking about ? 
  the uk does n't even have a functionning aircraft carrier , france is actually the only country with the us and russia to be able to bring nuclear jet fighters at the door of any country of the planet within days . 
   though not with lard . 
  how dare you . 
  funny that you 'd say that , i 'm french and i find our kebabs terrible compared to what you can find in germany . 
  the original croissant definitely comes from austria , but the croissant everybody eats today is definitely french . 
  it 's marie-antoinette who was austrian who introduced it in france ( at the time , food was mostly first adopted by royalty then it would become popular among regular people ) but it was more a kind of bread in a crescent form . 
  it 's only in the late 1800s that the croissant that became known worldwide with thin layers of dough and lot of butter was created . 
  nope , it 's from austria and the crescent form was chosen to celebrate the fact they repelled the turks . 
   defending itself involved , in part , taking the territory their enemies used to surround them from strategically key areas . 
  thank you but i perfectly know the propaganda isra\u00ebl uses to justify their bullshit colonisation . 
  and you can quit quoting wikipedia , i know what happened and it is still not a justification for what they did and what they continue doing . 
  they kicked the ass of every single country around , and all of them would not dare try to attack isra\u00ebl ever again . 
  the idf is more powerful than all of them combined . 
  there is no `` defence of the territory '' , there is just expansion of its territory and war was a good justification for it . 
   it was during this war that israel captured gaza ... from egypt - and capture the west bank ... from jordan . 
  wait ... 
  so isra\u00ebl did n't only defend itself ? 
  they used the opportunity to expend their territory illegaly and violently ? 
  yeah that 's exactly what i said . 
  yeah , a lot are leaving because of the attacks and fear of islamists , but that 's not massive either . 
  and a lot come back when they realise it 's more dangerous in isra\u00ebl than in france and that they do n't integrate eventually because they 're still culturally french . 
  you seem to conveniently forget that isra\u00ebl was given a specific territory and that israelis kept on expending it illegaly and violently at the expense of other populations . 
  and for your martyrdom rethoric about how much you suffer , france has still today the 3rd largest jewish population in the world after the us and isra\u00ebl . 
  ever wonder why ? 
  because french jewish killed during wwii account for 1,5 % of the total of the jewish killed . 
  that 's one of [ the lowest percentage of every other countries . 
  ] ( https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/holocaust/killedtable.html ) ( that 's a link towards a jewish website if you wonder ) . 
  that 's a nice one !, 
  you can keep telling yourself you 're a beacon of democracy exempt of any criticism , apart from a bunch of americans evangelist christians wackos the rest of the world thinks isra\u00ebl is just a rogue state with an ethnic policy that hitler would n't have denied . 
  `` your country did bad things decades ago , so shut up and let me behave like a piece of shit . '', 
  every israeli apologist . 
  what the settlers are doing with the blessing of the state is the textbook definition of stealing land whether you like or not . 
   they are ready to give up some of their freedom in exchange for ( both actual and economic ) safety . 
  and they wo n't get either . 
  and isra\u00ebl can also fuck off and stop letting settlers steal land , seems fair right ? 
  your last sentence is so true . 
  i 'm french and we have exactly the same problem , despite the fact we did n't take as many refugees as germany did in 2015 . 
  for all the people who are denied asylum , about 90 % do n't ever leave the territory . 
  and those are the economic migrants . 
  sometimes , they wait even years before getting a reply . 
  so they start sending their kids to school , work under the radar , etc. . . a lot of them are not living in a center but are just `` surviving '' and try to be invisible . 
  this is terrible for everybody : for them , because that 's the best formula to create criminals , even if they want to live a honest life . 
  and for us , because it costs a shitload of money , creates ghettos that are destroying neighbourhood and let people with no valid reason to be here enjoy free healthcare and social benefits . 
  shit , i 'm french and i 've seen this the whole summer in parks . 
  now i know what it is , thanks !, 
  that 's a really cool channel man thanks for sharing !, 
  by the way we never hear much about what happened in spain during wwi as well as wwii , if you have similar channels/websites i would love to check them out . 
  here it seems like spain completely disappeared during this time , only my father taught me stuff about it through his grandmother who was from girona . 
  george orwell 's `` homage to catalonia '' made me realize how spain was going through major changes and how intense it was . 
   pretty boring save for a few operations in both sides well i would have thought a battle like verdun that made over 700.000 victims would have been considered a bit more than boring . 
  holy crap you spaniards are hard to entertain !, 
  we surrendered in wwi ? ... 
   french legion etrangere is a hardcore military corp that forgives your crimes well , that was true 100 years ago but not anymore . 
  if you committed a murder , a rape or have been involved in drug trafficking you do n't stand a chance .

  as in many countries you have to get an authorization if you want to organize a demonstration -- because you will inevitably disrupt public peace ( even if it is only traffic disturbance ) and the police wants to take measure to cope with it . 
  ayraut ( pm ) just said that such a permit would not be granted . 
  however , you still can perform spontaneous demonstration : show up with a sign at the us embassy , maybe others will join you ( but if you text some friends `` come protest , it is not spontaneous anymore , and you are the organizer of an unauthorized demonstration ) . 
  the police still can tell you to disperse if they have reason to do so ( and if you are in front of an embassy , it is likely that the will ), 
  lol , the french are so cowards they 'd rather avoid stupid death !, 
  sure , for all that matter we could call him/her super-emperor or great khan , that would not change much . 
   america says `` iran war '' and we 'll say `` fuck off '' and there 's nothing they 'll be able to do about it . 
  what can they do now ? 
  curb cheese imports and rename their food ? 
  why ? 
  you can have a president appointed by the parliament ( in fact , that 's how most republics work ), 
  why ? 
  you can have a president appointed by the parliament ( in fact , that 's how most republics work ), 
  and nothing close to 10 000 years anyway . 
  as in most of the world ... 
  what has foreign politics to do with cultural differences though ? 
  misread , my bad . 
  i think he meant competition between nations , not club . 
  you have the 6 nations tournament . 
  of course not , they are space-lizards , that 's common knowledge . 
  they do not even deny it . 
  litteraly , `` for the flemish , the same '' . 
  it does not make a lot of sense though . 
  because jesus would disapprove of them ? 
  i though it was fine to be a catholic, 
  err , yeah . 
  what does this has to do with the pope or the vatican ? 
   have you been completely ignorant about the rampant child sex abuses that have been going on in the catholic churches all around the world ? 
  yes . 
  the coverups are bad , but one had to expect that a bishop who has tried all his life to be forgiving would be tempted not to denounce someone he was responsible for a a friend . 
   it has gotten so bad that the vatican stated that anyone who talks publicly about it will be ex-communicated , tens of millions has been payed to victims for there silence and the abuse still happens every day . 
  the vatican has stated that for people violating trial confidentiality and breaking their secrecy oath . 
  it does not mean on any account impunity : someone who has knowledge of pedophilia ( even through confession ) has to report ( whether it gets transmitted or not is the heart of the problem ) . 
   the vatican is still stuck in the dark ages when it comes to many subjects . 
  and while they have billions of $ $ in hard currency , ancient artifacts , paintings and statues they do very little for charity . 
  the vatican runs a deficit and lives partially itself on charity . 
  it has little hard currency ant it would be quite stupid to liquidate its assets as they earn him some money . 
  ( and are a fundamental part of the curch heritage ) . 
   why are people still starving in the world , when the vatican could bring a stop to it if they so chose to do so . 
  if they came out with a worldwide call to feed the poor , possibly even selling a few of there treasures to start the funding and stating that every catholic must send food/money to assist , starvation would be ancient history . 
  if they did so there would be a massive food price drop in africa and most of the farmers ( who account for a lot of the population ) would have no other resource than to sell their land and go , jobless , to the nearest township . 
  and how exactly is the will of the vatican to become richer while caring less about human welfare manifesting nowadays ? 
   the big , untouchable , religious institution who has the final word on anything and cares less about human freedom and spirituality and more about there own gains and wealth . 
  it 's not like you have anything to support that idea is it ? 
  it is still sometimes used to refer to a vagina . 
  but never to the woman owning it . 
  in the bible , the antichrist is defined ( in john , as it is his only appearance ) as a denier of the christ 's divinity . 
  so no , whatever you may think of the papacy , the pope can not be remotely be associated with the antichrist described in the bible . 
   that current emmigration which is yet to be proved . 
  ( arnault claims his move is not fiscally-related , and he has not really any reason to lie about it ), 
  funnily enough , the deficit has decreased this year . 
  http://www.lemonde.fr/economie/article/2012/09/08/bernard-arnault-veut-devenir-belge_1757416_3234.html and ... apparently that 's only very bad timing and has few to do with tax ( and maybe also a nice way to supply bullets to the opposition ), 
   wait , what ? 
  are you saying managing waste from research and medical applications is the same as managing waste from energy production ?!, 
  for most of the volume , yes . 
  the only waste specific to plants is long life and high-activity waste which accounts for a tiny volume . 
  for example you could fit all that france have ever produced in a pool ( although it would n't stay in their for long ) . 
  if you find a solution for one pool , you can easily scale it for two pools . 
  edit : you also have medium-activity long life waste , you can throw 10 more pools in . 
   right now the problem is that we do not manage waste and phasing out nuclear will change what exactly ? 
  ( i mean apart from demotivating research in waste management )  and i do n't know about france , but the german once are not designed to be protected against airplanes . 
  of course some politicans , just like in france , will claim everything will be fine . 
  the truth is when those things were built nobody imagined planes could be used as weapons . 
  so they did not put any consideration into it . 
  claiming they are save is just a measure to calm the public , there is no proof that they really are . 
  if you do not trust the designers of the plants for being honest enough not to outrightly lie like that their ca n't be a discussion . 
  and in the nuke world , companies are generally honest , but sometimes more obscure and opposant have a `` the aim justifies the means '' towards inaccuracies attitude . 
  from : http://energie.edf.com/fichiers/fckeditor/commun/en_direct_centrales/nucleaire/centrales/blayais/publications/documents/dp%20blayais%202012%20ind1.pdf my german skill are too low to check for the german plants . 
   what ?!, 
  you have too manage waste anyway . 
  the dangerousness/difficulty to dispose of waste does not increase greatly with the amount of waste you have . 
  therefore saying `` we are in a rush , we need to stop producing watse now ! '', 
  is unsound . 
   first two keeping nuke for a few years will have no impact on the amount of dangerousness of those . 
  plus i guess germany will keep using nuclear-based medicine , no ? 
   nope . 
  no nuclear plant in germany is capable of surviving an impact like that . 
  they were n't designed like that , so why should they . 
   they were n't designed like that , so why should they . 
  because they are enormous strengthened concrete structures * vs. * a shallow metal tube 10 times smaller ? 
   what about the nuclear waste 1 . 
  it 's not like we are in a rush to solve the problem 2 . 
  their is waste already , a little more would n't hurt that much  any commercial airplane could trigger a nuclear desaster this is a myth . 
   you can build very efficient storage power plants ( e.g. 
  based on electrolysis ) today for compensating and load balancing . 
  but that would mean the companies could not make a penny of all their coal and gas they own . 
  funfact : the electricity market is liberalized in the eu . 
  anyone can build a storage plant and use it to trade on the epex ( or local equivalent ) . 
  why is n't everyone doing it ? 
  because it still costs a lot for a not-so-great income . 
  the only ones doing it on a massive level are dams ( since they already have the infrastructure built ), 
  not all countries agree on authorizing this kind of modulation though . 
   hyperbor ~ ~ ic ~ ~ ean as well, 
  considering the demographics , yes we do . 
  well , the caption says `` ready to get lost '' does n't it ? 
   in the us , companies train their employees , and it is expected that someone who is new to a job will have reduced duties and a fair amount of mentoring for a brief period , after which he or she will be expected to take on the full responsibilities of an employee . 
  so it is in france . 
  except , you can go to an * ad-hoc * organism , say `` hey , i 'm qualified for this job '' and receive a degree ( granted you are actually qualified ) . 
  and i believe there is no really such thing as a `` cloth selling education '' , more likely a `` selling stuff education '' ( most likely bep force de vente ) . 
  and she is an `` apprentice '' .

  these election results are due to the high proportion of extra european immigrants , which some of them are responsible for most of the insecurity in the country , and people vote accordingly . 
  but otherwise , the french are very respectful and excited about other cultures , and love to travel . 
  i was almost disappointed when traveling around europe to see how numerous french tourists were everywhere i went . 
  i thought my travel destinations were original . 
  is that sentence ( `` something rotten ... '' ) doomed to be unoriginally used every single time there 's a story about denmark going awry ? 
  `` smart as a monkey , taubira finds the banana again '' these are expressions combined , and they basically mean `` smart girl smiles again '' . 
  to be honest though , while it 's racist , and meant to be shocking ( they got a lot of publicity from it ) because addressed to a black person , i thought it was pretty hilarious and well thought . 
  i 'm embarrassed to say i laughed my ass off when i read this in the newspaper . 
  we have edf ( electricit\u00e9 de france ) and gdf-suez ( gaz de france - suez ) which are mostly public companies , providing electricity and gas in france ( and elsewhere , as they 're pretty big companies ) . 
  i 'd say i pay on average around 50 euros a month for gas , and 25 a month for electricity . 
  i 'm not sure some concrete bunkers represent important historical artifacts for albania . 
  and anyway , there will always be some left , but they certainly do n't need to protect every 700,000 of them . 
  in my home town in the suburbs of paris , in the foresty area , there are still a couple ww2 german bunkers here and there . 
  they 're not exploited as tourist attractions because they 're just concrete blocks . 
  the town grows hedges or vines around them because they 're just ugly . 
  here 's the essential thing : the towns provided homes for the roma . 
  built them for them , and offered them jobs to integrate them . 
  otherwise , few other immigrant or homeless people get such easy hand outs . 
  the only reason why the towns figured they should hand them a future on a platter is because if they did n't they 'd be a problem . 
  if all the euros were n't actually the same currency , which could be used in any eurozone country , it would kind of defeat the entire purpose . 
  i can use a french-printed euro coin in greece and vice versa , and it has the same value in all eurozone countries , it 's just that the `` heads '' side of the coins have different artwork , just like i 'm sure a canadian dollar coin does n't always have the same design . 
  just threw it out there . 
  the french have their pride so could pass off as hostile to some americans , and we do like criticizing america ( americans hate the french because they think the french hate them , which makes it all a vicious circle ) , but yeah , i 'd say most french people understand the us are still our friends and we 'd rather the us as a superpower than the russians , chinese , or islamists . 
  sorry , but the latest intervention in mali , which the malian authorities begged for , was highly regarded as necessary , and practically unanimously approved worldwide . 
  and very objectively it was highly necessary for the interests of everyone . 
  and no , you 're not ready for a world war . 
  you 'll need to count on the military of your european allies who have a stronger capacity , and that is the uk and france . 
  though admittedly , greece is n't too bad considering your regional tensions force you into defensive budget , but other countries just lay back because uk and france . 
  yep , share the burden . 
  it 's not because the uk and france have a relatively respectful military capacity that we should be the only ones doing everything . 
  build yo fuckin ' army !, 
  counting those who did n't vote at all , those who were too young to vote , those who voted for the other guy ( a little under 50 % ) , hollande got a total of 18 million votes . 
  the total french population is around 65 million . 
  the french who voted hollande hardly represent a small chunk of the french people , and anyway , few considered he was some kind of `` saviour '' . 
  there was no equivalence with `` obamania '' . 
  some rejoiced when hollande was elected , but it was mostly because they were happy sarkozy lost . 
  typically in france , at least in the paris region , it can take 30 + years for a middle class family to finish paying their home , so many do n't bother buying . 
  about how much would it cost to ship a handful ? 
  her boyfriend , louis aliot , who is number 2 in the fn , is of jewish origin - his grandfather was jewish ( though he considers himself religiously christian ) . 
  reddit downvotes are inconsistent and often unexplainable . 
  you only have -1 for now , which thus is n't representative . 
  i 've seen many times on / r/europe americans with the top voted comment on a specific thread , which was n't about bashing america or anything , it was just the most enjoyable or insightful comment about a european issue . 
  so do n't take it too personally . 
  but i agree , there was n't anything wrong with your comment . 
  it 's a well done movie  . 
  it was still my `` copy/paste '' default because i had recommended it on reddit to someone looking for epic asian films . 
  oops . 
  that 's a mistake . 
  i wanted to link to sham marriages . 
  :p my bad . 
  fixed . 
  yeah , perhaps they 're not as racist . 
  the difference being between the us and france that in france , white french people are natives . 
  i think this accounts for a huge difference between european and us politics when it comes to `` xenophobia '' . 
  in the us , if you 're a white racist , you may as well be a neo-nazi . 
  in europe , you can be against extra-european immigration , and while the left will call you a nazi or something , it 's not a fact and the general population will allow it . 
  ah , that explains the amazing fact in that wikipedia article that one in six marriages in ireland are shams . 
  that 's incredible . . 
  i do agree with that , and think this `` president '' should be elected democratically in some way ( by the actual citizens , or by the parliament ) . 
  he should preferably be multilingual , it would be even better if he were at least a dual citizen of two eu countries ( not a requirement ) , and he should have the functions of representing the eu in a common foreign policy . 
  i imagine such a person making political and economic visits to the us , china and whatnot . 
  with all the economic weight of the eu behind him , he could be very convincing to the other world powers . 
  damn , norway has a ridiculously low number of jews . 
  in france there 's at least one jew ( religious or not ) in every classroom . 
  for sure , surgery for aesthetic reasons should be allowed on children if they have a certain deformity like a cleft lip . 
  if they just think their nose is too big , or their boobs too small , it should n't be allowed until they 're adults . 
  yeah , it 's extremely common in the us , even amongst non religious folk , and if you debate them on reddit some will get extremely defensive about the mutilation of their penis and how prettier it is , and how it 's better for their health , and how they 'll have their children 's penis chopped off too , even though they 're atheists . 
  [ sham marriages ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sham_marriage ) can be detected by officials though , who get especially suspicious when it 's a national marrying a foreigner . 
  obviously , i would guess that in most cases they 're not detected though , because what can one do ? 
  anyway , a rich person who can afford 650k would n't risk loosing half of his belongings on a divorce case after a sham marriage . 
  i personally consider the tea party more nuts than the national front , and as a french-american who votes in both countries , i did try to learn about both . 
  i 'm paraphrasing but he says `` only '' those who have n't experienced war call out to fight for queen and country , and that is absolutely not the case . 
  many historical examples exist , amongst british soldiers , but let 's take a more notable foreign example , hitler , who fought in the trenches in ww1 , and thus probably had a much more terrible experience of war . 
  and the guy speaks of his experience , probably in iraq or afghanistan considering the examples he 's giving . 
  those wars are notably considered utter failures in how they were dealt . 
  i 'm not saying there is such a thing as a `` clean '' war , but if you 're going to take the worst examples it 's not a very fair argument . 
   le pen plays on people 's fears , and as such is possibly even more dangerous than her father . 
  this is the kind of argument which very often comes out when speaking about the fn , and i guess the far right in general . 
  but look at that sentence objectively . 
  am i the only one to see the irony in it ? 
  i do agree with you that public displays of wealth in france are n't well regarded at all . . which indeed is in total opposition to countries like the us where it 's almost required . 
  the `` do n't argue about this with me '' was very clearly about the easiness of finding taxis in paris . 
  not about copenhagen . 
  i do n't see how that was confusing for you . 
  and i do n't care about your parisian friends in marketing . 
  they suck at finding a taxi . 
  it 's very easy for me , as i do it practically every night . 
  and you can say over and over again that i 'm being defensive and whatnot . 
  that 's not the case . 
  i 'm telling you how it is . 
  taxis are easy to find , and it 's pretty obvious that i know better . 
  regardless , even if it were true that no taxis could be found , it 's hardly the fault of any sort of governmental decree or something . 
  if the taxi service at night is n't lucrative or worth it , there wo n't be taxis , and the government ca n't force taxis to work at night . 
  what the government does though is provide night buses , which i admit are n't very practical . 
  edit : and yeah , inner city paris is pretty rich . 
  it 's paris . 
  you need to pay good money to live in a haussmanian complex . 
  you wo n't find much night life there . 
  i do agree though , that paris does n't have a great night life . 
  i 've been to copenhagen .

  so ... basically , colonisation ? 
  after georgia crimea and donbass , they would be quite naive not to prepare for a military conflict in transdinestria . 
  malta , because no one think of them . 
  both goal are linked . 
  if they are able to repel russia , it will be a serious blow to the russian occupation in transniestra . 
  we have one very active right now . 
  professor `` joyeux '' just launched a petition against measle vaccination . 
   a risk sharing mechanism that would have all the other states instantly pour money to a financially troubled one , greek spotted . 
  / s seriously . 
  while there is some sense in your third point , and allowing some states to pursue socialists or wellfare policies while other have a pro business low regulated can introduce heavy distortions in our economies , favoring the latests , a risk sharing mechanism is an appeal to irresponsability . 
  blaming mystical circles has little to do with differences between greece and germany as we share a currency and a free market . 
  a common minimum wage can be a good idea to decrease the difference between germany and greece , but germans wont abandon their full employement society . 
  you will to curb unemployement in your country more than they will have to increase their wellfare . 
  yes , and they are sponsoring ukrainians nazi against the totally democratic and indenpendant people of the donbass that arent a cover for the russian army and authoritaristic regime at all . 
  they were said to be quite racists though , but i certainely dont know tham as well as a belgian . 
  what about the vlamms belang ? 
  i was thinking `` lets negociate where the lava will be flowing '' but an economic crisis has more margin than a volcano . 
  a good analogy would be the baltimore mayor saying `` lets negociate the protests '', 
  oh , sorry , i did not mean it as an error , just the fact that tsiprass would like to negociate the term of an economic crisis would seem dellusional . 
   negotiate the terms of the crisis that is one really weird figure of speech though, 
  for a moment i did not see the link anymore ant thought he may have been deleted , as such thing are not uncomon in this sub , but it seem i was wrong . 
  edit : my bad . 
  i must have missed it . 
   the 19-nation bloc 's finance ministers were riled after greek prime minister alexis tsipras 's tried to bypass their veto on financial aid with an appeal to angela merkel on thursday . 
  how ironic . 
  after demonising germany and merkel , syriza 's last hope is merkel . 
  how deeper can he digg himself, 
  they did catch 5 attacks , ... but this news come only after they did not catch a sixth that was only caught by accident ( but he had the time to kill one person ), 
  i did mean that police departements , hospitals , have the mean to see who abused their databases and accessed personnal files for their distractions . 
  i wouldnt consider that an intelligence agency hasent the same kind of stuff . 
  you know , it is easy to makes system who track those using them . 
  people , dont be fooled by the conpiracy theorist that obviously didnt even bother to follow events and are mkaing things out of their a$ $ . 
  this comes after a wannabe terrorist was arrested because he hadent proper gun control . 
  of course now that they pass for amateurs they will say how effective they are . 
  it wouldnt be the first time a politician change its stance following events . 
  you have to live with today 's world . 
  create either / r/eurasiantreaty or / r/novorussia, 
  that should be a common practice . 
  deletion withouth reason often lead user to think of the worst . 
  yeah , he probably only eat meat in his dinner . 
  while i dont caution / r/europe politic of removal of controversial links , i dont think this can be blammed on one moderator . 
  by the way . 
  the semicowardly way you designate him make me feel consider its more like a witchhunt than a debate . 
  : use your real account if you have any balls . 
  the dutch one . 
  not since 2010 . 
   russia has never deny his support to the separatist movements how about you try ? 
  http://genius.com/russian-foreign-minister-sergey-lavrov-there-will-be-no-russian-military-intervention-in-ukraine-annotated#note-3998530 http://www.themoscowtimes.com/news/article/lavrov-no-russian-intervention-in-ukraine/506231.html http://en.interfax.com.ua/news/general/233433.html http://www.radiohc.cu/en/noticias/internacionales/20178-no-russian-troops-spies-in-e-ukraine-lavrov http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/01/21/us-ukraine-crisis-lavrov-iduskbn0ku12y20150121 http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-27063231 http://www.israelnationalnews.com/news/news.aspx/178105 http://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2014/03/04/285653335/putin-says-those-arent-russian-forces-in-crimea http://joinfo.com/world/1001134_sergey-lavrov-sees-no-russian-troops-in-donbas.html http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2015-02-08/lavrov-s-comedy-routine-on-ukraine-isn-t-funny-to-europe, 
  itl : an inteligence general announce that the russian didnt have the logistical ability to fully invade ukraine , but dispatched units to fight ukrainian while claiming to be rebels . 
  that is the same sources sputinknews and other propaganda channel used restlessly these last day to imply there was no russian invasion in ukraine . 
  * does your country use the euro ? 
  yes * what do you think of the euro ? 
  its really usefull to travel other countries and still have a grasp of things values . 
  moreover , it is nice having a currency not on a constant inflationist spiral . 
  * how would you like to improve the euro ? 
  remove 1c and 2c coins * do you think the euro will still be around 20 years ? 
  yes , there will still be euros in 20 yaers , although it is possible that greece will not be a part of it anymore . 
  so , i guess tsiprass did not retunr * completely * empty handed after all . 
   i can link you plenty of videos with ukrainian soldiers next to bodies of the separatists with tied up hands . 
  please do . 
  actually , i think you misinterpreted the phrase in question . 
  there was a lot of euphoria in / r/europe as tsiprass was elected , and a lot of people were prentending he was going to change europe politics , and negociate with germany to form an wide anti austerity southern alliance . 
  but thing did not turn out as promised and he did quite a lot of political misshap , failing to collect any substancial support and antagonising germany . 
  while i dont know / u/kaptajnkaffe initial position on syriza , i understood that not as a hate for greek , but as he was `` runing out '' of his initial enthousiams . 
  moreover , his initial phrase is clearly an expression of sympathy for the greek people :  it must be pretty frustrating for greek redditors to see us focus so much on every sentence uttered by greek politicians . 
  edit : there may be greek bashing in the comments tree , but honestly , most of the people here express their frustration at tsiprass . 
  dude , i have nothing agaisnt greece . 
  if you are talking about [ this post ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/31vnyx/tsipras_in_moscow_i_once_again_want_to_say_how/ ) , then the topic you are refereing to highlighted how ** tsiprass ** was a huge hypocrite saying one thing to germany and the opposite for russia . 
  the conclusion of my post was * `` can tsipras word even be trusted '' * it is a pretty straightforward critical of this politica lfigure . 
  if any critic of tsipras is deemed as greek hating , we should ban all critical of europeans leaders . 
  wow , just like half empty trucks are `` standard procedure '' for humanitarian aid ... seems russia has a lot of standard procedure that are very odd but very convenient do deny their dark schemes . 
  this thread seems to have been removed from / r/europe . 
  i am seriously at loss about why this did break any rule . 
  can any of you point me to the reason why this could have been removed ? 
  edit : its back on . 
   the deal is to set up joint russian and greek partnership to export agriculture products to russia well , that is mostly a gift for putin , and wont have a significant impact on greek economy  also tsipras walked away with a 40 + billion $ pipeline deal . 
  errr , that is quite far from your version , do you have any source for yours ? 
  edit : text about the pipeline in the guardian live thread :  it ended with a few comments on greece 's potential participation in the turkish stream pipeline project . 
  putin said nothing concrete was agreed , but greece could potentially earn millions of euros every year from the project . 
  well , it seem he came back empty handed anyway : [ rt ] ( https://ruptly.tv/vod/view/26651/russia-greece-was-forced-to-vote-for-sanctions-on-russia-says-putin )  we understand that greece had to vote for sanctions against russia . 
  and of course the counter sanctions hurt greece as well . 
  but it 's not our fault . 
  fifty percent of the imports to russia were agricultural products , but unfortunately ** we can not make any exceptions for countries inside the european union ** '' . 
  and russian squad accidently invade ukraine ... [ wait ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-28934213 ) ( this was not accident , it was at the heart of the russian counter offensive ; the only error they commited was probably that they forgot to dump their uniforms and documents ), 
  what about their lower body ? 
  its like an unhealthy relationship , when the gf want to be dropped but hasent the courage to do so , and is hence making the life unsefferable . 
  this can go a long way if no action is taken , and she has the mean to crash the couple finance . 
  they are really trying hard to be kicked out . 
  what is he not saying is that having historical friendly ties with russia is perhaps the greatest danger for a country . 
  i honestly dont have a clue , but i am sure that both theory can not coexist ( islamic and european takeover ), 
  so , it is not an islamic takeover anymore , but a european one ? 
  [ reference ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/operation_trojan_horse ), 
  if it is a correct exit , and if greece create a new currency while destroying its euros , this could be a painless measure for europe , and will not affect any budget . 
  but , if tsiprass decide to screw the eu and issue a new currency while keeping the current eu stash as a bonus , it could end in tears . 
  more likely , europe will declare any greek issued bill as a false currency and people will have to check the back of their coin and their banknotes numbers as a lot of `` false '' money with perfect quality will suddently be in circulation . 
  circlejercaty with memetic representation .

  the reactions of other powers is not conditionned by a nation history .

  i 'll be quite happy if a few ee countries leave the eu . 
   of 10 central europeans that visit france , 9 are sent back ? 
   ut of the money your goverment gives them in order to relocate back to romania . 
  that stopped in 2012 . 
  now they just one ticket home . 
    gotte get all that free money plus they can cough earn more in the west . 
  they do n't get any more money . 
  you should check that cough though . 
   romania for more than a month before they are on the move towards france so do romanians want romania to be left out of the eu because obviously borders do n't work and romanians ca n't be held in their country ? 
  because i ca n't stop seeing ee complaining how they should n't get refugees because they ca n't keep them in the country . 
   yeah calais in pas-de-calais you do realise that calais is just ** one ** part of nord-pas-de-calais , right ? 
  have you ever left your island ? 
   the rural communities in the provence that border the arabized cities ( such as marseille ) are strongholds of front national . 
  up to 50 % of the vote . 
  let 's take the most `` arabic '' city of them all . 
  paris . 
  look at that . 
  no one around paris voted le pen . 
  wtf ? 
   on the other hand , communities in bretagne , which have almost no arabs/muslims around , are voting for mainstream candidates . 
  mind your own country buddy . 
  they were granted refugee status so by definition of what means to be a refugee , they 're refugees . 
   did the comimisision bother to ask if these people want to come here ? 
  they do n't want to stay in greece or italy either . 
  what 's your point ? 
  asylum is n't friggin shopping . 
   what are we supposed to do with them once they try and take a hike to germany ? 
  put a fence , barbed wire ? 
  shoot on site ? 
  you 're not supposed to do anything . 
  germany will send them back home once they 're caught on german soil . 
  that 's what we do with ee and eu citizens we catch in france that do n't have the means to live here . 
  we sent 13k back home just in 2015 . 
   relocating people who do n't want to be in poland they also do n't want to remain in greece or italy . 
  nope . 
  we do n't know it . 
  they 've been granted refugee status . 
  they 're refugees by definition . 
   they are not effectively being forced to do so . 
  again they do n't have the right to move in another country . 
  just like gypsies can not move in france if they have no means to live here . 
  that 's why we expulsed 13k of them in 2015 . 
  you see a polish refugee on your territory ? 
  you send him back home . 
  it works no different to any other system . 
   politics is a tournament of psychopaths . 
  the eu is no exception , neither is my czechia proper . 
  have you seen your president ? 
  the statements he makes ? 
  i 'd really avoid making statements about other countries with rulers like that ... 
  really ? 
  because polls really do n't show that .

  i reheheheally doubt leavers cared much about the eurozone . 
   refugees * 1 ) berlin was n't a refugee but someone that was refused asylum * 2 ) munich was the kid of a refugee iirc . 
  so what are you talking about ? 
  ^ ^ ^ ( dangerzone ), 
  i did n't talk about america . 
  you were replying to a thread replying this :  i do n't know , right now it 's just the u.s. and britain acting silly right now . 
  they french gave me a little hope . 
  okay fine let 's talk about france . 
   the milquetoast liberal 's victory is neither inspirational or a paradigm shift . 
  so the guy that : * never was elected before ** in any position ** won directly the presidency * first president since 1958 ( actually before ) not from a major party * will bring a majority in parliament to a party that ** did n't exist 1 year ago ** * first centrist and first non big party majority since 1958 is ** not ** a change of paradigm ? 
  and : * the youngest president under the french republic ( so 200 years give or take ) , * a party that will win majority and has ** [ 1/3 of parliamentary candidates starting in politics just now ] ( http://www.lemonde.fr/les-decodeurs/article/2017/06/07/legislatives-un-tiers-des-candidats-de-la-republique-en-marche-sont-de-vrais-novices-en-politique_5139798_4355770.html ) ** is ** not ** inspirational ? 
   those problems are still going to be with you in 5 years . 
  maybe yes , maybe no . 
  but here 's the thing , at least we know we have problems . 
  that 's why we 're trying to find solutions and we 're doing new things . 
  you americans still live in a world where everything is fine or if you 're a dem , you probably still think : eh in 3 years will vote him out and we 'll go back to normal , because trump 's appearance on the political scene was totally a fluke , guys !, 
   he only got 24 % of the vote in the first round . 
  yeah dude , that 's how normal elections work instead of your retarded two party system . 
  it was a vote against fascism , pure and simple . 
  not a vote for him you americans did n't even muster to do ** this ** simple thing . 
  we 've been told for ages how wrong us french are doing everything , how great the us is at doing everything . 
  look black president , look how low unemployment after the crisis , look the french have terrorist at , the dumbasses . 
  yet you voted the fascist cheeto benito and 2/3rd of french voted no to that . 
  so no , you do n't get to comment on other people 's politics when you vote in an idiot that does n't know how to shake hands and wants to ban muslims from entering the country . 
  oh , and before commenting next time on a thread about human rights that the usis n'tthat bad , let it sink in that ** even ** marine le pen gave up the promise to implement the death penalty ( only have a ref on it ) while ** both ** us candidates are in favour of it . 
  so yeah , americans stfu . 
  he 's a guy that had no party and was never elected before . 
  how much will he get in the parliamentary elections huh ? 
  and what 's your issue with fillon and melenchon ? 
  at least fillon never said he 'll reduce abortion rights and voted to eliminate the death penalty . 
  while ** both ** major us candidates were in favour of the death penalty . 
  really dude , you do n't get to comment . 
   point : she was both polish , and french . 
  how 's that relevant in a discussion about the greatest french of the 20th century ? 
   and two , her major discovery is in 1898 , so she belong for the greatest of the xix century . 
  said the guy that called de gaulle the most important man of the 21st century . 
   her french heritage is disputed ( see below ) . 
  by whom ? 
  she ' buried in the friggin pantheon . 
   she never lost her polish identity one having a different identity does not mean they 're not french . 
  napoleon was n't french born was he ? 
  she took a french citizenship , a french name that you so kindly crossed out . 
  guess you know what 's best right ? 
  her children and son in laws had a significant influence in france . 
   greatest man of france for the xxth century , and the xxi st , so far . 
  i believe france has had greater people marie curie for example . 
  her work was fundamental in physics and her offsprings and heirs to her intellectual legacy ( daughter and son in law ) were essential in creating cnrs and cea .

  in which way is your accent silly ? 
  swedish silly or french silly ?

  thankfully my agreeing with an irish is not frowned upon . 
  is that such a bad thing ? 
  they commited major fuckups in the past like rwanda , but these days they do n't do much apart from protecting the french expats and peacekeeping . 
  i think the countries where it happens could use the help . 
  they 're far from being as stable as the former soviet countries , to say the least, 
   even the french are largely off it implying there are still places where it 's not the case ? 
  if you 're thinking of africa i disagree , france still has a `` sphere '' of influence as you say , but it 's nothing comparable to what russia does . 
   when italian police/army `` accidentally '' crosses their border to remind them who 's boss or by negligence ?

  look , it would be nice if were able to help everyone and give free money handouts to every poor person of the planet , but we just ca n't . 
  what aka_sotof said in the big comment above makes sense . 
  poor countries rely on rich countries to get help , and if our own countries collapse we wo n't be able to help anymore . 
  also , i do n't know why you are upset that we put our people ( europeans ) first . 
  everyone does that , you included . 
  if you tell me you would rather help a stranger rather than a family member , either you 're a liar or you have one messed up family ... 
  this kind of `` industrial tourism '' where everything is processed and fed to you from a conveyor belt is very popular with the chinese right now . 
  when their middle class gets richer , they will get into a better quality tourism : more personalised travels , where they venture somewhere in smaller groups and make their own experience . 
  a nice cup o ' brainwash for breakfast every morning will do that to someone . 
  it 's the only country with a position of `` co-prince '' that i know of . 
  that being said , the french president does basically nothing for the management of the country so i would say he does n't really count .

  spanish is a romance language like french and quite big in the world , as such it is very popular . 
  maybe more than english ( but i 'm not sure if it 's more widely spoken , as english is possibly the easiest language to learn ) . 
  german is very far third . 
  in middle school we all have to choose between this and spanish for our second foreign language ( the 1st being english ) , and most people go with spanish for the above reasons . 
  german makes sense economically , geographically and it 's quite a wanted skill here , but it 's just too hard to learn and to practice for us ( also it sounds angry :d ) . 
  i 've taken 7 years of german , yet today i ca n't hold a simple conversation without stopping every 3 words . 
  italian i think is a quite popular optional language in highschool . 
  it 's what i did , and after only 2 years i already spoke a better italian that i speak german today after 7 years ... this should tell you something hahaha after , it 's the `` up and coming '' but unusual languages like arabic , russian and chinese that are popular but it 's quite difficult to study them in the secondary cycle . 
  i probably forgot many others but the big ones are here . 
   is it not important to speak pretty standard-english for jobs and studying ? 
  well , not always ... it 's gaining importance every year , but there are people who just are n't interested in jobs where they would have to deal with foreign languages . 
  they are just fine with remaining in france so they ca n't be bothered to learn stuff they think they wo n't need . 
  i know small entrepreneurship is big in france , so when someone plans to create their own business from scratch and probably stay local , i can see why they would n't bother . 
  except if they want to be in new technologies . 
  if you 're looking for classes in english here , you 're going to have to go for specific fields . 
  for example my case , i 'm 3 years into my 4-years business degree , and i had classes in english for the first time this year because i chose `` international business '' . 
  fortunately english is becoming prominent in more and more fields now , and coupled with this recent `` legalisation '' in universities it 's going to become harder to avoid , even for lazy people , 
  now i 'm curious to know why they take so long to explain it . 
  it seems pretty straightforward to me , what else is there to say apart from `` run the fuck away and call the police '' ? 
  it 's the school system that has ** a lot ** of room for improvement mostly . 
  a secondary factor can indeed possibly be a form of protectionism in cinemas and on tv , productions in original language are uncommon ; the result is we are not as exposed to english as we could be . 
  but even then , we can blame this on the small number of people who have control over the audiovisual industry in france , this is not something we consciously partake in as a people . 
  we could say that the french lack motivation to learn languages , but it 's apathy and not active rejection . 
  i have honestly never met anyone with a mentality along the lines of `` ha , we french people are too good to learn other languages . 
  english is for lowly peasants ! '', 
  i think the french you met here are the kind of self-bashing people our country produces `` en masse '' . 
  we definitely have our pride to the point of sometimes being arrogants , but being proud of willfully remaining ignorants is a level of stupidity i ca n't conceive for us . 
  if you think many of us are bad at languages because we are `` too proud '' of our own , you are terribly misled . 
  what the hell is this about ... 
  [ do n't underestimate the dangerosity of teaspoons ... ] ( http://static.cinemagia.ro/img/db/movie/45/80/48/the-horribly-slow-murderer-with-the-extremely-inefficient-weapon-516109l.jpg ), 
  i think he 's choking . 
  pat him on the back . 
  easy , ask around you `` when was the last time you ate horse ? '' . 
  i do n't think i have even * seen * horse meat in my last 5 years of shopping , be it in malls , grocery stores or butcheries . 
  or just make a google maps search on any part of france you want with the word `` boucherie '' , then a new search with `` boucherie chevaline '' , you will see 95 % of the dots disappear from the map .

  this surprises me though , because the center party in france which supports him ( the modem ) is painfully mediocre . 
  but their president on the european level seems considerably more charismatic and presidential . 
  why an american presenter ? 
  why does there always have to be an american presenting or reporting or introducing official eu stuff ? 
  nothing against americans , it 's just weird to me , and i see it all the time . 
  yeah , but we associate it to giving kids `` american '' names , and it just sounds very `` white trash '' . 
  same with `` jennifer '' for girls . 
  germany most certainly did not trigger the euro-crisis . 
  of all things , it carried it . 
  i must admit , that 's quite an eloquent and well developed answer . 
  thanks . 
  as a french parisian of breton origins who 's a french patriot but also a huge ( perhaps clich\u00e9 ) fan of `` celtic culture '' , your answer surely made me gain a little perspective on the matter . 
   as a leftist and regionalist , i could n't dislike the national front more that sort of thing always made me smirk . 
  i get that the fn would likely shut out regionalism . 
  but you should understand/appreciate the gesture . 
  you 're a nationalist , or at least a patriot , for your region , just like the fn people are nationalists , or at least patriots , for the country as a whole . 
  you 're the same . 
  i 've never really understood why regionalists in brittany are so painfully leftists . 
  corsican regionalists are far-right leaning . 
  that makes sense to me . 
  that bretons regionalists are leftists , that does n't make sense to me . 
  you 're regionalists because you rightfully think you have your own identity and whatnot . 
  yet you 're leftists , so presumably pro-mass-immigration and open borders , with the classic universalism sentiment that we 're all part of one humanity and whatever . 
  so why this separatism coupled with universalism ? 
  you probably feel regionalism will give more democratic power to you and your region . . etc. 
  but what about the eu ? 
  unless you 're anti-eu far-left , the eu as an overseeing , `` foreign '' political power is the same as the nation of france . 
  well actually , france cares more ultimately , as it carries brittany in its heart considering almost everyone in paris claims to have breton origins and brittany is a beloved/trendy region . 
  also , with the typical pro-immigration stance the left wing has ... let 's just carry the argument a step further . 
  is there some point , some threshold , when leftist breton regionalists might consider that immigration should be limited , because at some point , if a threshold of foreigners is reached , brittany will loose its specificity ? 
  and there would thus be no point in considering that it 's in any way different than all the neighboring melting-pot regions where people come from all over , where it 's all just a huge mix of everything and anything ? 
  how would brittany feel like brittany , or be different enough to claim regionalism , under a scenario where immigration is so massive that the bretons in ancestry and culture are relegated to some folklore , and a few untouched villages ? 
  ps : i understand historically why irish republicans ( who were thus regionalists within the british empire ) were left-leaning . 
  first off , it was back in the day when mass immigration was n't particularly part of left wing ideology . 
  also the irish were actually oppressed by imperialism , so the left-wing political thought made sense . 
  that 's hardly the case for the bretons nowadays . 
  if we click on each country we get a little explanation/comment . 
  it does n't really explain portugal ( it just says portugal does n't depend on russia in anything significant ) , but if anyone wants a translation for their country , feel free to ask . 
  this is hilarious . 
   too polite we know , tedious and bland . 
  op said it already , 
  also , generally in presidential debates with the 2 main candidates ( and potential future president ) , journalists are particularly easy going . 
  i remember seeing this issue debated in some show , about how compliant journalists are towards the ( `` king - '' ) president or potential president . 
  i think it 's not only a degree of pressure from the president 's cabinet , but also in french mentality : that the president needs to be treated with some form of reverence . 
  i did n't really mean to paint lobbying in a negative light . 
  that 's why i mentioned environmental lobbies for example . 
  i mean in general i 'm fine with environmentalism pressuring politicians through lobbying , since i believe it 's the right thing . . 
  lobbying however does tend to serve special interests , by definition , and thus may not be in the interest of the majority . 
  be it large companies with financial interests , or minorities ( ethnic or social . . etc. ), 
  who through lobbying manage to weigh more politically than they could through the normal democratic process - and they do tend to be very militant and they speak louder than the majority in a way . 
  there are plenty of lobbies , in every country or association of countries . 
  they 're maybe not as obvious in the eu as in the us , but there are certainly lobbies in europe . 
  any interest group can act as a lobby . 
  farmers ' associations can be lobbies . 
  in france for example , labor unions essentially act as lobbies , and they 're particularly powerful . 
  that 's why we have the ( true ) stereotype of striking all the time , and not getting any labor reforms done . 
  otherwise , if i dare be more controversial , there 's this jewish organization ( i personally have nothing against jews , but this is quite notable ) called [ crif ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/conseil_repr%c3%a9sentatif_des_institutions_juives_de_france ) in france , which blows my mind ( and does a disservice to jews imo ) by managing to organize dinners with every new french president , or important french political leader , to discuss issues relating to the jewish community in france , and also israel ( it 's a fairly famous event , called the `` diner du crif '' ) . 
  they 're definitely a jewish or israeli lobby , right there in the open . 
  anyway , i 'm fairly sure there are environmental lobbies , human rights lobbies , financial lobbies , banking lobbies , energy lobbies everywhere inside eu institutions ( some eu energy companies are among the top in the world - like total or suez in france - they motivate our governments to send thousands of troops to defend their assets ... they 're lobbies , be sure about that ) . 
  in france most people have a lawn area with different trees , plants , flowers , in their gardens . 
  a simple lawn , with perfectly kept grass and nothing else seems weird in france , and people do associate that look to what they 've seen in american films . 
  vegetable gardens are rarer than having some simple , no-need-to-take-much-care-of fruit tree , but i think the trend lately is towards more and more vegetable gardens . 
  yeah , i got ta agree . 
  especially considering the precedent that some 15 years ago germany was considered the `` sick man of europe '' , and people were hardly expecting it to do so well a decade later . 
  as an american you 're to / r/europe what women are to radical islamists . 
  your opinion/account is worth 1/3rd of that of europeans in this subreddit . 
  i thought americans found the `` basic '' english accent classy or cute . 
  prague is moving up in fame as a tourist destination . 
  otherwise , the average frenchman does n't know much about the czechs . 
  my personal stereotypes about the czechs , which i do n't know if they 're shared by others , is good , cheap beer , pretty ladies , and prague is good to party . 
  well , people laughed because it 's an obvious slip-up `` pickpockets and gypsies '' ... also , there seems to be an unusual amount of young guys in groups on the train and in the station . 
  i may be wrong but these guys could be going to a football/soccer match , and they do tend to be the loud , laughing type , especially when they 're together like that . 
  the most famous bastard from french history is william the conqueror ( guillaume in french ) , so the first name would be guillaume/william . 
  france comes from the franks , which means the free men apparently . 
  a bastard is typically not really attached legally to his parents ( in medieval stereotypes ) , so that 's a good last name . 
  guillaume le libre = william freeman, 
  i recognize his face from some sketch or scene about free water , which was funny . 
  but otherwise , i do n't see how the fact he 's maybe a famous comedian makes his spitting on a political tract edgier or funnier or not simply stupid . 
  on the contrary , if he 's famous , it makes it all the more ridiculous for him to do this . 
  now i 'm surely missing something . 
  maybe it 's part of a routine and he 's expected to do this sort of thing . 
  in that case , my bad . 
  wow . 
  wtf ? 
  that sounds awkward . 
  that scottish guy 's video is pretty much immature imo . 
  he 's free to dislike ukip 's positions , just like ukip is free to have their own positions . 
  i just do n't think they deserve that much hatred for someone to make a video of himself spitting on their tracts as if they were the scum of the earth . 
  also , it 's hardly edgy to spit on a political tract in a free country . . 
   including the west , ( except germany ) many western countries other than germany have admitted past crimes , or at least tried to pay amends in the form of special privileges to the descendants of the recently oppressed . 
  i 'm thinking of the us and france here , but i 'm pretty sure the uk , and perhaps australia and whatnot , have surely admitted some colonial crimes as well . 
  i agree though , that the norm around the world is to not admit past crimes . 
  but in the western world , governments do tend to officially recognize them , even after a couple decades . 
  elsewhere , from japan to turkey , they just plain out deny them . 
  i 've never heard this stereotype from french society . 
  i think it 's an anglo thing . 
  by that i meant , if they had a polish mother , or grandparent , but a french father , they could have lost any indication of their polish origins through their last name ( which would n't be polish ) . 
   if i need to get somewhere and it 's further than 500 meters away , i drive there seriously ? 
  it would take 10 minutes to walk that distance , if you walk slowly . 
  poles were among the first waves of immigration to france , before massive immigration from extra-european countries , so there is a relatively decent number of french people of polish origins , who are entirely assimilated , and no one would know they 're of polish background if it were n't for their last name ( if they still have a polish name ) .

  lots of people would be absolutely horrified , and it 's probably against a whole slew of human rights . 
  that is such a stupid proposal , of course people would be horrified . 
  democracy 's a bitch , but without universal suffrage it just does n't exist anymore . 
  oh and / u/ivanow  this way everyone working honest job , no matter if it 's hedge fund manager or mcburger flipper have a saying in how society they contribute to is being ran , equally ( everyone meeting criteria gets 1 vote ) , and if welfare queens and other parasites want to participate in political process too , all they have to do is get up from their asses and find honest work . 
  so one is a parasite and a `` welfare queen '' if he 's unemployed ? 
  that 's a very dangerous and classist stereotype that does n't hold against reality , and the system both you and daphedk are proposing just goes towards excluding even more the already excluded , making unemployed people `` sub-citizens '' . 
  oh and having a job does n't suddenly makes you politically competent . 
  the whole proposal is disgusting , stupid and means the end of democracy if put in place . 
  and before it became muslim/arabised between 700 and 1000 , the middle east was basically a decaying persian empire with local warlords and nomads , despite a very strong christian presence at least in syria and egypt . 
  then it became the center of the world ( title shared withconstantinople ) for 5 centuries before the turks/mongols took over . 
  so religious change does n't mean much on its own . 
   how large of an impact , a small demographic change can have . 
  or of how overinflated nationalist fears about muslims are ? 
   the north of paris , maybe 50 % are muslims what do you call the north of paris ? 
  because i live there and while muslims are seen more frequently than in some other places your figure seems way off . 
  more like 20 % / 30 % if you count the poorer parts of the xvii\u00e8me , the xviii\u00e8me and the xix\u00e8me . 
   you can only see people as good and evil , you do n't think about ideologies . 
  right . 
  i study political and social sciences in order to avoid this stupid `` good/evil '' dichotomy that serves no purpose other than to further political agendas . 
  i do think about ideologies , a lot actually . 
  therefore i know that contrary to popular beliefs islam is n't at all a monolithic ideology , and some of the most radical islamists ( salafis ) would paradoxally be those to reject violence the most . 
  i know that as with many religions people use it to justify one thing and it 's contrary , because like every religion some parts contradict each other , and like any religion its interpretation is highly political . 
  i do know that for many people in muslim-majority countries , like it used to be and still is the case in many places with christianity , religious belonging is way more of a social phenomenom than a free-will choice to follow one . 
  i know as well that those who commit terrorist acts , especially in the west , usually know their religion very poorly and do n't follow many of its teachings . 
  i know there are huge political issues in the middle east that makes radical ideas and terrorism thrive there . 
  with all that in mind , i still know that what you call `` ordinary muslims '' are still the first victims of this violence , and acting angry about it like people in this thread do does n't change that fact . 
  i do n't support islamic ideals or even religion at all , i do n't think muslims are especially good people compared to any other group of people because it makes no sense to make such huge generalizations , and i do think the worldview of many influent islamic organisations and thinkers is quite a problem today , even though there are way bigger ones . 
  i do n't however vow an irrational hatred based on fears from right-wing illusions on these people . 
  sorry about that , / r/europe . 
   saying muslims are the first victim of islamic attacks is like saying a suicide bomber is the first victim of his suicide bombing  no one is saying muslims are bad you 're either saying muslims are bad or suicide bombers are good , pick one . 
  you volontarily conflate ordinary people with those in power , and you know you 're doing it : you 're talking about people one second , then states without transition . 
  it 's a shame that it 's impossible to have a cool-headed discussion on this without downvotes raining . 
   saying muslims are the first victim of islamic attacks is like saying a suicide bomber is the first victim of his suicide bombing that 's stupid . 
  so we should blame all white people that are remotely christians for charleston ? 
  no , of course not . 
  the individual doing the bombing is to blame . 
  the whole community of muslims is not . 
  you can not dismiss that muslims are victims of this on the grounds of similar religious beliefs , it just does n't make sense . 
  it would if the vast majority of cultural muslims ( cause let 's face it it 's not even really a religious matter at this point , that and terrorists are often not very religious at the start ) did and condoned such actions . 
  they do n't . 
  you do realize you 're basically accusing more than a billion people of terrorism ? 
  you do realize if that was the reality the situation both in the middle east and europe would be even worse than it already is ? 
  you do realize the quoted sentence does n't make sense at all , that islam is far from a unified religion ? 
  seeing how naive , inconsiderate and biaised your comment is , i doubt it . 
  muslims are the first victims of `` islamic based terrorism '' , both in numbers killed and in the backlash when shit like this happens . 
  does n't mean at all that we should bend over to sa or something ( ppl in this sub build the best strawmen ) but it 's just a fact that you should n't ignore . 
  y becoz in me area they drug dilers ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ / s, 
   when they 're not shooting at you , gang-raping a girl in a basement or burning cars you 've never been in a `` difficult '' neighborhood have you ? 
  you sound like the most stereotypical `` valeurs actuelles '' piece on the suburbs i 've seen . 
  by always bothering the same people , you marginalize them , increase their chance of commiting crime and increase their chance of punishment , which means more crime and poverty in the end ( prison makes recidivism more likely ) . 
  for instance , as a white middle class guy , i know i 'm way less likely to be busted for weed , and even if i am they 'll just take it from me and call it a day . 
  an arab guy with a tracksuit or something , they 'll cuff him and keep him for hours , unless he runs from them but then when they catch him it 's even worse . 
  is that fair ? 
  no it 's not . 
  is that even a way to fight crime ? 
  neither , it 's counterproductive and perpetuates the very conflictual relationship between `` urban youths '' and the police . 
  when every single day you get your id checked , and you know full well it 's because your face is tanned , it does n't matter if it 's the same policeman or a completely different guy , you 're not gon na develop positive feelings towards the institution they represent , whether you 're a criminal or not . 
  when the bac cuffs you to the ground instantly because you dared to answer them , it 's not gon na go well either . 
  your black and white vision of the world seems very convenient . 
  so you have money because you deserve it but people in poverty deserve it too because they `` cruise through life on state benefits '' ? 
  i 've never seen such a good example of that extreme individualistic mindset you seem to embrace that completely ignores the reality of the hereditary nature of wealth and poverty , the challenges of a life where you only rely on state charity . 
  in the vast majority of countries , most people on welfare have it way worse than you seem to think . 
  they too might have worked hard , made sacrifices . 
  they die earlier , are in a poorer health , suffer way more from both social exclusion and psychological issues . 
  but that 's because they 're lazy is n't it ? 
  usually no . 
  it 's because they were n't born privileged and they did n't have opportunities that you and i might have had . 
  and i do n't mean to make anyone feel guilty about that , it would be hypocritical and pointless . 
  however it 's important to acknowledge it to step out of your own socially natural bias . 
  oh and of course as many others have said better wealth redistribution benefits everyone in the end . 
  the figure of the `` benefit scrounger '' is convenient , because it makes for an easily identifiable ennemy whom is hated because he 's said to be lazy and a fraud . 
  however it 's also vastly misguided . 
  it represents tiny amounts of money compared to the fiscal evasion that the richest people do . 
  they do n't pay more money than others , they actually usually end up paying proportionnaly less compared to the middle class . 
  the world is way more complicated than the hard work/laziness dichotomy makes it look like . 
  they are from the imf , the eu relief fund ( i think ) and the world bank , in the case of greece at least . 
  which is one of the reasons it 's hard for the whole thing to move forward because each creditor has its interests in mind . 
  english hooligans do too , regularly being pointed out for drunken brawls and racism . 
  here it seems like it 's shared responsibility afaik , drunk idiots from both sides shouting and fighting , with great chants like `` isis where are you ? '', 
  from the brits . 
  [ history sure loves to repeat itself ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jun/10/trouble-marseille-1998-violence-england-euro-2016 ), 
   the fact england fans were targeted by local hooligans and reacted your own bias does n't represent a fact mate . 
  more like they 're not allowed not to use it . 
  they have done it systematically in every single one of the protests since march , tear gas is their specialty . 
  heck even erdogan , who sure knows a thing or two about crushing protests , criticized our government for the violence . 
  [ here is an example ] ( http://www.lexpress.fr/actualite/societe/en-images-loi-travail-paves-molotov-lacrymo-heurts-a-la-manif-parisienne_1791491.html ), 
  there it is . 
  saying that western countries are in part responsible for this is equal to saying that `` these people are n't responsible for their choices '' . 
  i do n't think that , i do n't think we should be nice to saudis because they 're here thanks to a century-old mistake . 
  you volontarily and wrongly assimilate wahhabism with salafism and ignore the cold war as a factor in radicalism ( the 1953 iranian coup , the american support to the afghan rebellion that helped create talibans and al-qaida , the rejection of panarabism ) . 
  sure , self-determination is a thing as ultimately you 're arguably free of your actions , however thinking of any historical process or event as nothing more than self-determination , especially when talking about colonial and post-colonial areas and undemocratic regimes , is a mistake . 
  `` it 's own failures '' are amongst other things the result of wrong policy choices by world powers in the region , and undestanding that is key to a proper understanding of the region . 
  people sadly have a tendency of seeing extremes everywhere , like your answer to my post shows , despite me agreeing with most of what the article says you treat me as / r/europe fantasmed `` regressive leftist '' . 
  you should be more open-minded than that and treat facts for what they are , your strong ideological filter wo n't allow you to understand things in a nuanced way . 
  what 's funny is that you talk about wahhabism and ignore that it spread thanks to the british gift of the arabian peninsula ( to simplify the story ) to this radical family post-ww1 . 
   you do n't understand causality . 
  event b happening after event a temporally , does not imply that it was caused by event a. embarrasing that one would even have to point this out to you . 
  when you talk about history , causality is a thing if you take several factors into account : economic situation , social trends and forces as well as political events . 
  saying that the post-ottoman colonization of the middle east and the very poor decisions taken by western powers there from ww1 to today is one of the big culprits of the situation today ( from sectarianism and ethnic conflicts to radical religions ( catholics in lebanon did things that were n't pretty ) ) is definitely the historical consensus , it 's not rocket science . 
  of course speculation on alternate timelines is fairly pointless , but not having counter-factuals is not relevant as we 're talking about history .

  the democracy index ranks countries on an overall score based on 5 criterias : * electoral process and pluralism * functioning of government * political participation * political culture * civil liberties these ranks are calculated based on 60 criterias on a country . 
  the evaluation given are described as `` expert assessments '' . 
  all eu countries get a score above 9 in `` electoral process and pluralism '' and above 8.5 `` civil liberties '' , so that 's not the issue . 
  score is given from 1 to 10 , 10 being the highest . 
  if the overall score is below 8 , the country is considered a flawed democracy . 
  above 8 is a `` full democracy '' . 
  below 6 is a hybrid regime ( think hong kong or singapore ) and below 4 is an authoritarian regime ( china , dprk ) . 
  ranked from least flawed to most flawed : * portugal , overall score ** 7.81 ** . 
  low score in `` political participation '' ( 6.11 ) * france , ** 7.77 ** . 
  low score in `` political participation '' ( 6.11 ) * slovenia , ** 7.76 ** . 
  but 6.25 in `` political culture '' * italy , ** 7.74 ** . 
  6.43 in `` functioning of government '' * greece , ** 7.65 ** . 
  5.71 in `` functioning of government '' * estonia , ** 7.61 ** . 
  low score in `` political participation '' ( 5.00 ) * slovakia , ** 7.35 ** . 
  5.00 in political culture , 5.56 in political participation * cyprus , ** 7.29 ** - 6.11 in political culture , 5.63 in political culture . 
  * lithuania , ** 7.24 ** low in functioning of govt ( 5.71 ) and political participation ( 5.56 ) * poland , ** 7.12 ** low in political participation ( 5.00 ) and political culture ( 6.25 ) * latvia , ** 7.05 ** , low in functioning of govt ( 5.36 ) , political participation ( 5.56 ) and political culture ( 5.63 ) * hungary , ** 7.04 ** , very low in political participation ( 4.44 ) * bulgaria , ** 6.78 ** very low in political culture ( 4.38 ) . 
  * romania , ** 6.54 ** very low in political culture ( 4.38 ) and political participation ( 4.44 ) basically , eu citizens all live in countries with good civil liberties and free and fair elections . 
  the issues are in political participation ( in a lot of countries , people do n't care about the elections ) , functioning of government ( corruption , inefficiencies ) , and political culture ( which is mainly in former eastern block countries where it is understandable ) . 
  highest overall score : norway , 9.8 . 
  ( fun fact : norway is not a real country . 
  it is a political ploy to make you feel like something better would be possible ) .

  when will one french government have the courage to stand up to the ~ 2 % of voters who work in agriculture ? 
  i do n't get why this lobby is so powerful ... 
   priority in case of a blood donation , that is free honestly this one is a little scary ... 
  i give regularly but my cousin ca n't because she 's too light ( < 50kg ) . 
  why should i get priority over her in case of an accident ? 
  really ? 
  how frequent are we talking here ? 
  well , look at is this way : the chinese will make planes , whether we help them or not . 
  might as well make some money on the way . 
  there are many types of roma in france . 
  a very large proportion lives and works in france very much legally with little to no problems : they have french citizenship and have special rights given their nomadic lifestyle . 
  they are called `` gens du voyage '' or `` journey people '' . 
  they are roma , but most have been in france for generations , and they are descendants of the nomadic gypsies you find in many stories/movies here . 
  the roma who are expelled are a different case : they are of romanian citizenship and emigrated to france fairly recently . 
  before 2007 , a large number of them came to france illegally ( as romania was n't a member of the eu ) . 
  they now come legally , but under the special status that bulgaria and romania are in right now , they ca n't work legally in france ( or other eu countries for that matter ) . 
  that will change soon , as the special status should be revoked in the coming years . 
  until that time , they have to apply for a working permit like other non-eu citizen , and those permits are limited to a few professions . 
  the new left-wing has done and is doing a few things to try and help them integrate better . 
  the number of professions open to foreigners was reduced by the previous government from 120 to 22 ; the current government has reverted that measure so the number is once again 120 . 
  there are talks of opening more professions to the roma . 
  that said , to continue with these useless and costly expulsions is a real let down . 
  they are useless as these people can once again come legally to france . 
  they are costly as we pay every person who returns to romania 300 euros ( half for children ) , and the trip back ... 
  i had hoped the socialists would instead try integration measures . 
  hopefully , the current actions were more due to political inertia in the ministry . 
  as for an actual solution ... not easy integration of the roma is a big issue all across europe , as is [ antiziganism ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/antiziganism ) . 
  like with most problem between communities , there is no silver bullet . 
  personnally , i believe that equal access to education will go a long way . 
  teaching french would also help , as would an access to the job centers we have here i guess . 
  i hope hollande and manuel valls will try different things , see what works ... 
  great point !, 
  i 've often thought that the eu gave opportunities to people like jean-claude juncker , viviane reding , olli rehn , etc. 
  who make me feel as though they are `` too big '' for their countries . 
  it would have been a shame to confine these people to helping only their country when they can have an impact on 500 million lives . 
  actually it did n't , despite all the predictions to the contrary . 
  no reason to expect it would be different for romania and bulgaria . 
  the manneken pis in brussels . 
  the thing is known for being underwhelming . 
  i knew that , i prepared myself and i was still uderwhelmed . 
  however , it 's right next to the grand place which is a sight to see . 
  my point is simply that illegal immigration is n't nearly as much of a problem as most crimes . 
  hell , speeding causes more deaths than illegal immigration every year , but gets much much less attention . 
  i hate that we spend so much money trying to fix an unfixable non-problem . 
   i hope you 're not implying that anyone who 's against illegal immigration is a racist ? 
  no , just that the reason for the previous laws is that sarkozy was trying to please the racist fringes . 
  moderates who are against illegal immigration do n't choose their candidate based solely on this issue , only the far-right does . 
  too much of our resources are spent on this `` problem '' . 
  illegal immigration is the * only * offense which requires the judge to give a verdict within a fixed time frame ( 4 weeks ) . 
  the result is verdicts that are given without proper inquiry ( resulting in a few rebuttals from the european court of human rights ) . 
  this also is quite a drain on our the budget of the ministry of justice at the expense of judging people commiting actual crimes . 
  up until last week children were detained in our retention centers , which have abhorrent living conditions . 
  i voted for hollande in the hope that he would once again make france a country that take care of immigrants instead of throwing people back out just because the racist fringes of our country ca n't handle different cultures . 
  i 'm glad he 's delivering , and i can only hope he will go even further . 
  our national motto is liberty , equality , fraternity . 
  helping immigrants should be our duty . 
  edit : vocab, 
  personnally , i care as much for the chinese workers as the local workers . 
  hell , the french unemployed can rely on the social security net ; chinese people ca n't . 
  if french and other european companies want me to buy their products , they 'd better give me a better reason than `` we were born closer to where you were born '' . 
  music is adapted from `` the russian revolution '' by the red army choir : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jo5-hm6xkt4, 
  just showed it to my chinese girlfriend . 
  she does n't speak cantonese so could only understand a few words . 
  her impression was that , though it is slightly over the top , it 's a fairly common metaphor . 
  to the chinese , and i guess a lot of people in east asia , sports is about winning and crushing the opponent . 
  another example of this sentiment would be what the north korean team said before facing portugal during the last world cup : `` we are here to take revenge for our last encounter '' . 
  that encounter was 20 years earlier ... 
  hong kong network : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/now_tv, 
  people who only know the stereotype of the mexican deep in siesta say the mexicans are lazy . 
  this stereotype probably stems from the cultural difference between spanish origins where naptime is important and english origins where adults do n't nap . 
  or we have homer , in response to the greek crisis . 
  hollande ( cleverly ) never went in any detail other than the fact that he want a renegotiation aimed at growth rather than austerity . 
  the main thing on which he was very clear with that is that he wanted the renegotiation before applying the treaty in france . 
  i voted for hollande in the second round . 
  renegotiation of the fiscal pact is one of the things i hoped he would n't do once he became president . 
  let 's hope this is just pandering for the upcoming elections ( legislature ) and goes under the rug afterwards . 
  good news for hollande .

  and i was making fun of y' all for the brexit ... 
  seems like i might move to london !, 
  maybe you want to hear about the concessions he is asking : * stop the independence of the european central bank . 
  allowing the purchase by the ecb of government bonds . 
  forbidding the ecb to stop giving liquidity to a european country ( free money everyone , paid by germany ! ), 
  * devaluate the euro to get the parity with the dollar ( no reason to do something like that , i have no fucking clue what he is doing , i think he wants to increase inflation , he needs a 4 % inflation for his program , that is against the maastricht criteria of course ) . 
  * bring the finance to heel , forbid toxic securities , tax financial transactions , control the capital movement to prevent a speculative attack . 
  * organizing a conference on sovereign debt that will lead to a moratorium ( more time to reimburse ) , changing the structure of debt repayment , and cancelling some debts . 
  * stop the liberalization of public services ( railroad , telecom , energy ) * setting up a `` united protectionism '' : ending the free movement of goods between the eu and other countries , stopping the free trade policies that ruin europe and the european economy * ending social dumping inside the eu and quickly harmonize upwards the social and fiscal policies in the eu and a clause to forbid relapse of social rights . 
  * changing the common agricultural policy to warrant a self sufficiency , and relocate the agricultural model into an ecological one . 
  * something about warehouse gas i translated his program ( [ here ] ( https://laec.fr/section/51/plan-a-proposer-une-refondation-democratique-sociale-et-ecologique-des-traites-europeens-par-la-renegociation ) ) everything that is between brackets is by me , and yes i translated faithfully the words they use ( they say `` bring the finance to heel '' ) . 
  the results of those negotiations would lead to a referendum about france 's future in the eu . 
  no will say his supporters . 
  he just wants to make a meeting with russia to discuss about changing borders in europe . 
  yes , a new republic . 
  he wants to pull a cameron and negotiate an agreement with the eu or he 'll call for a referendum to leave . 
  the eiffel tower is so big that you can see it from lyon , more than 400 kilometers away . 
  that is the reason why someone answered a comment i made 142 days ago today !, 
  it was 40.000 $ of suits actually , and that 's usually 8000 $ a suit for that brand . 
  think a bit . 
  lighting a crisis is going to play erdogan 's game . 
  if we want to beat him , we have to beat his ideas , not fuel his nationalistic speeches . 
  why do n't we invite some of his opposition members to make a speech instead ? 
   for the last two months people talked about the schulz hype and how it will end * very soon * yet here we are . 
  every major poll so far this month has the spd standing at at least 30 % . 
  you also have that in germany ? 
  in france we have a macron bubble that is supposed to blow up soon since last year . 
  maybe eu lover , social liberal progressists are n't a bubble then . 
  when are your elections ? 
  do you think an election of macron could give some fuel to an election of schulz ? 
  ca n't wait to see the franco german couple moves europe forward !, 
  https://fr.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/crise_de_la_conscription_ ( 1944 ) it 's in french tho , article in english is not complete enough, 
   large parts of canada 's army were volunteers from quebec . 
  [ no , they were not , and again they were treated as 2nd class citizens , thank you for reminding it . 
  ] ( https://fr.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/crise_de_la_conscription_ ( 1944 ) )  just like how napolean treated the rest of europe ? 
  you are the one talking about napoleon , that was not the subject , but let 's talk about napoleonic wars . 
  there were coalitions of european kingdoms ( financed by the uk ) to stop the revolution in france . 
  why did they get involved in our affairs ? 
  we were attacked during the napoleonic wars , we defended our country . 
   brits and other allied soldiers died in dunkirk too . 
  many french soldiers made it to safety in britain , what 's your point ? 
  and disembarked without weapons in brittany . 
   also , do n't act like brits did n't die in that battle , they certainly did . 
  only 10 % of the captured allied soldiers were french , leaving the other 90 % being british and commonwealth countries . 
  yes , from india , they were part of the en d\u00e9route uk army . 
   the free french lead the defense * because they wanted to * . 
  they wanted to prove to the rest of the allies that they were a competent fighting force capable of operating with other armies . 
  the free french in this battle volunteered to be at the head of it . 
  the free french upper echelon was pestering allied high command to let them lead that operation . 
  no man , this is revisionism , you just are so arrogant . 
  and about :  lol no , nice historic revisionism though . 
  no , it 's actually famous that the siege of bir hakeim allowed the british army to reconstitute and stopped during 15 days the german army . 
  anyway , i 'm not going to argue anymore with you , i can see that you have only learnt the british point of view of history , and that is sad . 
  happy brexit . 
   canadians died in france to free it and french died in dunkirk to give time to the british to run back to their island , french died in bir hakeim to avoid the english army to be wiped out by rommel and ending the african campaign , do we always remind you that at every god damn opportunity ? 
  no , there are only americans and british to always reminding you the time they helped you and not the time they treated you like shit , so yes it happens that some canadians died in france during ww2 , but no i 'm not going to blow their dick and forget about how y' all treated the quebecer and the natives during centuries . 
  yeah , but without the ussr attacks on the east , no attacks would have been possible in the west . 
  damn y' all get fucking triggered so fast you forget to think, 
  the only time i remember the canadiens fighting for france , that was in the franco-indian wars . 
  i do n't think i need to recall you that they fought for the uk . 
  and did the uk really fought for france , or for itself and it happened that its interests were the same as the french 's ? 
  no , it 's not the same . 
  i 'd imagine a basque politician coming to france and telling the basques to separate however , and that 'd be a more accurate comparison . 
  ahah i know i like to trigger them !, 
  they need to see things from other point of views sometimes . 
  you are giving too much credit to americans and british in the organization of the resistance . 
  and the operation overlord was not the only invading operation of france , there was also the operation dragoon , that involved 270,000 french . 
  but i understand you need to keep that silent , you think you did everything in ww2 . 
  and europe was liberated thanks to the ussr , without them , d-day would never have succeeded, 
  but quebecer were happy , and that was the goal . 
  i understand but why is that moronic ? 
  do you want to ask r/quebec their input on that matter ? 
  american orders . 
  ( no you are giving way too much credit to britain and america ), 
  why ? 
  ( actually it was a popular uprising organized by the resistance , and the 2nd division blind\u00e9 arrived on the last day , and yes the first company to arrive of the 2nd db were spanish ), 
  [ for some reasons , they do n't like french politicians giving speeches in canada . 
  no it 's not , literally \u7f8e\u56fd means beautiful country , but it means america , and it was chosen for phonetic reasons , not for complimentary reasons . 
  and , i 'm not a native speaker , but i think that mei is only for women !, 
  mei \u7f8e does indeed means `` beautiful '' but it is only phonetic . 
  \u6cd5\u56fd france means country of the law , but it is only phonetic also !, 
   according to my chinese teacher , countries ** without ** a guo are not really countries for chinese . 
  and you are right , taiwan is a province according to them !, 
  btw how was it ? 
  i 'm enrolled in a double degree and i go to taipei next semester !, 
  guo in chinese means country . 
  the first syllable just sounds like the beginning of the word : * yingguo = ying sounds like eng in england . 
  * faguo = fa sounds like the beginning of france * meiguo ( us of america ) = mei sounds like the me in america . 
  according to my chinese teacher , countries without a guo are not really countries for chinese . 
  you know that in france , only individuals can give money to a party and no more than 7500 $ ? 
  you know that he has the support of a lot of people including a lot of former socialists such as the mayor of lyon ? 
   he has no program it 's funny that you comment that the day he presented his program . 
  moreover , if he win the presidency , his party can win the legislatives . 
  hollande did not have a majority when elected , 
  last summer , i went to french catalonia . 
  we crossed the border ( la jonquera ! ), 
  to get alcohol because it was half the price we got in france !, 
  so yes , we make more money in france , but if i had to spend 5 $ in alcohol , i 'd chose spain instead of france , cuz i could get drunker . 
  a cooked ham and a dry ham , so i 'm shitposting with a straight wine and a wine with fruits !, 
  next time you go to starbucks in america , just order an extra espresso .

  yes the 27 and britain, 
  i like to hear good news about my country and my neighboor . 
  and i happy that your country is going well . 
  go to france and buy it from illegal seller around the town or in the internet . 
  well we have a lot more cheese than that : brie , bleu d'auvergne , cantal , gruy\u00e8re , mimolette , munster , petit suisse ( often used as a dessert ) , pont l\u00e9v\u00eaque , raclette de savoie , reblochon , rocamadour , roquefort . 
  every r\u00e9gion and department have is own speciality each `` fromage '' are different . 
  you do realize that 100 years ago there was war who involve hundreds of thousands soldiers with million of death , entire country destroyed , disequilibrium in the demographic balance , death gaz and the threat of atomic war . 
  and now you are scared by 100 lost soul . 
  if we have only a free trade agreements ( fta ) : country a have norm on how to produce something . 
  country b do n't have those norm and can flood the country with cheap low quality products . 
  country a would have less interest in this free trade and will quit or will ask to make common norm . 
  if common norm exist , only condition to make a true fta , we will need a organization to regulate . 
  europe ca n't have a fta without common norm . 
  the goal of this union is to cut down the cost and maximize the profit . 
  we have a common market because we trade with our neighbour . 
  but by doing so it higher the monetary risk ( devaluation ) and to prevent it a lot of company pay for derivative . 
  more a country devaluate more it export . 
  and if one country does this the other will answer with another devaluation and we all end up with a monetary war ( disastrous for the economy ) . 
  for having more efficiency we create a monetary union . 
  the wish to have a stable exchange rate have always existed from the gold standard ( were every money have a set value ) to the first attempt to have a monetary union in the 19th century to the european monetary system and finally the euro . 
  for even more efficiency and relocate the right resources to the right place the freedom of movement of human was created . 
  it higher the tourist revenue and can bring worker were they are needed . 
  we will need a protection against protectionism too if we want to avoid monopoly and state owned enterprise who flood the market ) . 
  and once you have all of it you realize that you have union worth thousands of billion and using it as a negotiation power is the final goal . 
  all of this was made with only one goal efficiency . 
  the creation of the institution is just a neccessary byproduct of it . 
  well can still do a laisser faire policy but if nobody play by the rules every body loose . 
  devaluation war , cheap quality , tax heaven , end of minimum wage , less tax , less social charge and benefits . 
  true they took 1million and half people and only a dozen is suspected honestly i would have imagined more . 
  it is obviously the fault of the european union , leaving and paying a exta tarif on their exportation will make the uk great again . 
  i understand now why nearly every muslim country have the sharia law in the constitution but did n't enforce it . 
  i am not saying anything . 
  but coming from france i do n't believe any american announcing no go zone . 
  yes it matter the other articles annonce what is the focus of the journal , the seriousness and the bias . 
  asking if that matter make you look really dumb and make me question your education . 
  this time is different we have a sea to protect us , this is not like they can walk to europe . 
  wait, 
  read the other article of this `` journal '' this is a really funny site you bring here . 
  true symbole of ireland economy, 
  this 0 to 6million right ? 
  yes i did and i know that nearly every one of them end in blood , pain and happiness . 
  interesting i did n't think about that . 
  but i still stand there is a war of information and we are loosing it . 
  european leader if they do something wrong must be trialed and , if we do n't trust our own judiciary system , we should be able to trial them ( leader ) with the european justice court . 
  yeah moldavian are really small, 
  yep but we are already spyed by the brit and the american . 
  each time we have to beg to have their information . 
  the only difference is that it will be our own state and we will have the info faster . 
  and they lived happily ever after / s, 
  oversimplification, 
  international relations is not fair, 
  yes i did . 
  i never messed them before but since nobody correct me about it , i thought it my work . 
  but thank you , 
  as long as the comission is a incomprehensible black box it will be the government easy scapegoat . 
  even if the concil obey directly to those governments . 
  more power to the parlement will make the nationals governments play toys useless and then we will have true cooperation between the people . 
  this was the solution of australian . 
  each time they had a invasive species they introduced their natural predators and ended up with two invasive species . . ex rabbit < fox, 
  they just have to introduce a predator . 
  it will be easy / s, 
  i just realize that even if the donald and european are awful . 
  atleast the donald is fun . 
  damn the donald made racism great again . 
  if they did n't change the name it will be lost anyway, 
  there will be a lot of particle name : `` de '' with the town of origin . 
  ex : jean charle de villeneuve , marie andrea de basse terre and mohammed francois de saint denis . 
  and libanon ? 
  true . 
  but the point still stand . 
  northern cyprus is a vassal state of turkey but turkey recognize their independence . 
  this is not a turkish colony atleast not in the 21th century, 
  when someone you need to use this expression to explain how a population is treated this mean the solution is really bad . 
  only despicable country would use this logic . 
  there is no turkish colony in cyprus . 
  there is a wannabe state that only turkey recognize . 
  turkey will never label northern cyprus product in their name . 
  unlike palestine the french does n't recognize the existence of the state of western sahara . actually france does n't recognize palestine on this current condition and this current border , western sahara does n't exist at all ( in the eyes of french diplomacy ) . 
  i do n't get it . 
  on the res it is written x-posted . 
  if i did it wrong how should i do this then . 
  i am \u00e0 liberal socialist and i really advice you to vote . 
  because this is what democracy is . 
  even if it is for lepen . 
  the funny thing was that right after the american election they were saying that there was no chance of polling miscalculation . 
  because the french model was better than the anglo, 
  but jerusalem and the middle east will still be gods favorite place, 
  election in march need the socialist and communist vote . 
  castro is popular here, 
  i am french and i watch french news, 
  them ? 
  this is not \u00e0 terrorist attack, 
  the fact that a spanish was the one saying it makes it even more perfect, 
  great acting . 
  even if they tried to do better ( and i assure you this is what they do ) . 
  this will be disregarded by biased anti eu media . 
  ignored by the general population . 
  and the national government will stole the benefit and the credit of those law . 
  more than the rise of political islam i think that the is tied to the trend of rising populism . 
  of course if we transpose to a regular european country .

  the best documentaries are usually on arte . 
  france has already been through an ethnocidal period in the 19th century . 
  the teachers , the `` black hussars '' of the republic as they were called were sent to teach french everywhere and reduce the monarchist influence of the clergy ( you call me a franquist , but what has the monarchy and the clergy done for the republicans in spain ? ) . 
  it is written in our consitution that you can not divide the french in different ethnies by the way . 
  if the regional languages speakers had to rise up , they 'd rise up from the tumb , it 's not like in spain where millions of people speak catalan everyday as it is their native languages and they 'd be wrong not to defend it , as their language is their culture but here , those who speak occitan or other regional languages are already old , and they are dying , and even though some people learn to speak those languages , they are not really numerous . 
  on this subreddit , people miss that crucial element , also , nobody is oppressed . 
  you 're free to speak a dying language if you want to . 
  they are more or less all dead , the regional languages . 
  basque , catalan , and breizh still survive somehow , but their future is n't bright . 
  i personally think regional languages divide the nation and should be forgotten , they belong to folklore , fortunately , those languages are irrelevant in french political debates . 
  it 's a big cultural difference with our spanish neighbour . 
  i do n't know what you qualify as common knowledge . 
  to me it is , but whether it is or not is irrelevant . 
  the reality is that it is a prussian military symbol that is associated with the german armed forces , and they still use it to this day . 
  it only stands if you have a shit knowledge of history . 
  makes me think of borat song everytime .

  translation of the lyrics , i wanted to use a spoiler tag but i do n't know how to , i did what i could , it 's something particularly hard to translate .

  for scientifical purposes , do you say it like `` proot '' ? 
  to this day , france still gives algeria millions of euros every year in subsidies and reparations and has better relationships with north african countries , including algeria , than your neighbor armenia , and we had a vietnam-style war with algeria . 
  algerians do n't wake up in the morning and think `` damn , i hate france over the independence war '' , it 's mostly some second generation immigrants in france who say that because they want to blame someone for their shitty situation . 
  also we did n't genocided algerians . 
  that 's important . 
  during the colonization , there were crimes against humanity commited against the population , both indigenous and colonial . 
  i do n't deny the french authorities did fire on the crowd , at s\u00e9tif notably . 
  but that 's an event , an anedocte . 
  under french rule , schools and universities were built , increasing literacy , infantile death was reduced by exporting medical infrastructures and hospitals and basic hygiene . 
  the population of algeria that had been stalling tripled under french colonization , going from 3m to 9m . 
  i guess we were not that efficient at genociding algerians . 
  also we developed the economy of algeria a great deal , where others just saw a desert and a slave trading hub , we built an real el dorado with the algerians , the benefits of which , i do n't deny , were reaped by the french in algeria . 
  also , before algeria was french , it was under ottoman rule . 
  it was a slave-trade hub , white slavery , but also black slavery was the core fo the economy , captured women were turned into prostitutes and sent into harems , black slaves were all castrated and sent to die of hard labour in the ottoman empire , and white slaves when young were transformed into soldiers , or would be sent to the harems too , because pedophilia was accepted in islam and still in afghanistan for example . 
  cervantes was one of the most famous slave of the pirate states . 
  the ottomans were n't kind with the algerian natives either , they treated them like inferior human beings . 
  and before the muslims conquered north africa in the 8th century , there lived the proud berbers , and also a great deal of jews and other minorities . 
  reducing algeria to algerians when the country at its core has many tribal identities is a fallacy . 
  so before you spew the same bullshit erdogan did and compare two situations that have nothing in common , check your facts . 
  thank you . 
  you 're right and wrong . 
  france 's economy is not in a good shape currently compared to germany , but it has probably more incentives for people to have kids than germany , it seems it is way easier for a woman in france to keep both a career and have kids than it is in germany . 
  working mothers are not taboo at all here , but in other countries , you 'd get remarks like `` you 're working instead of raising your kids yourself '' more often ( you do hear that here from times to times though ) . 
   french redditors try to evoke the idea that european cosmonauts are french this statement is false . 
  cosmonauts are soviet/russians anyway . 
  it 's a bit weird to make a big fuss about a word . 
  using another word in this case would be gramatically incorrect . 
  it so happens that american use astronauts , and russian cosmonauts , and french spationauts , and other nations sometimes use other words as well ( japan , china ect ... ) , it 's not stupid , it 's culture and history . 
  i understand some of you are not very open-minded , especially when it comes to france and the few french exceptionalisms , but do n't you have bigger topics to get mad about instead of derailing a thread about our beloved esa ? 
  the hundred years war takes place from 1337 to 1453 and troyes is the scene of a particularly unglorious event for france , the signing of the infamous `` shameful treaty of troyes '' on the 21st may of 1420 . 
  during the war , the king of france charles vi ( 1368-1380 \u2020 1422 ) is an insane man ( today , we would say he 's schizophrenic ) . 
  his wife , isabeau de bavi\u00e8re takes advantage of his condition to make him sign the treaty with the english . 
  in the treaty : his wife isabeau makes him declare that the heir and his own son charles vii is a bastard ( which also hurts the reputation of the king quite a bit , because that would mean his spouse isabeau was unfaithful ) , therefore unworthy to inherit the crown . 
  additionaly he gives away his own daughter to the king of england , which would make him king of france as well in a mariage which too place on june the 2nd the same year in the church of saint-jean-au-march\u00e9 . 
  so in one treaty , he gives away the kingdom , marry his daughter to the enemy and betray his son who 's fighting the english . 
  later , the victories of charles vii , with the help of joan of arc makes the treaty void . 
  the monarchy in france also evolved , as scholars were looking for a way to make the treaty useless , they came up with the rule that the kingdom does n't belong to the king of france , and therefore he can not give it away . 
  still , the kings of england officialy kept the title of king of france for four centuries , before giving it up in 1802 after the peace of amiens . 
  that mohammed merah was a former french secret service agent and was assassinated becaus he knew too much . 
  that the kouachi brothers attack on charlie hebdo was a false flag operation . 
  that the famous stand-up comedian `` coluche '' was assissinated because he posed a threat to the power ( he would ran for the presidential election to mock the establishment , and died in a traffic accident ) . 
  famous singer `` balavoine '' was also assissinated because he denounced the politics of president mitterand on live tv ( he died in an helicopter crash during the paris - dakar desert rally race ) . 
  that lady d. was actually murdered and it was n't a car accident ( it happened in paris so i put it there , but it 's more about the uk i guess ) . 
  so does legifrance !, 
  maybe it 's useful for a developper , but that 's all that is then , a developer tool . 
  a lawmaker or a professional has much better tools available to him . 
  http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/ is much better . 
   there is no such thing as `` different people '' . 
  all gaps can be fixed by policies of assimilation , education , being part of the workforce and decreasing the causes of social exclusion . 
  the huge majority of the roma communities do n't want that . 
  it would be close to a cultural genocide . 
  they do n't want to be part of the workforce , assimilate , or get a regular education . 
  that 's what sendentary people do . 
  mathematics , litterature , musical education , all of that is crap for their kids in their culture . 
  they have other codes . 
  they wont mix with the other romanian kids . 
  it 's a nomadic culture that has lost all the relevance and usefulness that it once had as means of communication and travel have evolved . 
  as a result a large part of their kind survives by stealing , begging and scamming and in turn they are hated from greece to ireland , from portugal to the north sea , because the world has become sedentary and they have remained travellers . 
  meh , it was a heart attack , this kind of stuff could happen anywhere . 
  given the other articles presented on the sidebar , i actually agree with you . 
  the lybian crisis started with the economical crisis , wheat prices were becoming too high , and the pressure on the population was too high , so they rebelled and gadaffi responded with force , shelling cities , killing civilians . 
  you ca n't stay idle while on the other side of the med a crazy dictator is slaughtering his own people . 
  the civilians losses inflicted by the western armies in lybia were minimal . 
  i 'm not a warmongerer but the europe + us intervention in lybia was n't frivolous .

  so pretty much for every situation . 
  it is so commonly used that when i was little , i did n't even know it was a swear word and not an expression . 
  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gseadq6sps0 merde . 
  meaning , `` shit '' bordel , literally , whorehouse . 
  you use it when you discover a messy situation , : `` c'est quoi ce bordel ! '', 
  but bordel act also as a multiplicator when you combine all these swear words together . 
  like , instead of saying `` fuck i forgot so save my work '' , a french would say : `` putain de merde '' . 
  but if you are angry , you add `` putain de bordel de merde '' ; or `` putain de bordel de bordel de merde '' . 
  of course , there are variants with other swear words like : `` putain de pute de bordel de chi\u00e9 de bordel de merde '' but usualy , you begin with putain , and end with merde , all the word within having something related with whore or shit . 
  but if you want to insult someone , you can just say `` connard '' , `` encul\u00e9 '' , `` fils de pute '' ( son of a whore ) , `` troud ` uc '' ( asshole ) , `` enflure '' , `` enfoir\u00e9 '' , `` bouffon '' if it 's a girl , you `` re gon na want to say : `` salope '' , `` p\u00e9tasse '' , `` pauve pute '' , `` poufiasse '' , ( these words can all pretty much translated to bitch ) ... or the feminine variantof the male insult : `` connasse '' , `` bouffonne '' ... its really important , when necessary to adapt the genre of the insult , if you were to say `` connard '' to a girl , it would totaly discredit your argument . 
  there are probably a lot more , but that 's what come to my mind right now . 
  exclamation like : `` sacrebleu '' , `` morbleu '' , `` catin '' , however cool they may sound are n't commonly used anymore . 
  yeah , for it 's next door neighbourgs , andorra is a real eurosaver !, 
  it 's like a huge duty free zone . 
  or a little tax free country . 
  thanks guys . 
  and now you are ridiculous . 
  so basically , you would have to choose between staying true to your liberal but isolated self , or compromise with germany to screw us over ? 
  damn !, 
  tough choice !, 
  ( insert smiley here ) still , i would be interrested to know why would germany benefit from a closer alliance with the uk . 
  i mean you guys are n't even in the euro ? 
  plus they are talk about you leaving us or something ? 
  i think that what you call rural development is actually the subvention to the production , so that the farmers can survive in the european economic environment . 
  do n't go batshit on me , i never touch any of that money , i swear ;  as for the `` france ca n't get away with that '' , well , it 's the other way around , like atheistmill said , we already do get away with it . 
  because even if we gain from the pac , we still are one of the main contributors to the eu budget in terms of millions of euros , or in other words , we contribute more on other post and get less return . 
  so if you want to reduce the part that beneficiate to france , well we will just reduce our contribution to the budget of the eu , since it is still decided by the european council . 
  and believe me , each chief of state has its pet project to defend . 
  but i really doubt sweden pay that much for the french wine , really , like as said in my first post , the cap is an old scheme to get money from germany ; it was maybe relevant with 12 members , not so much with 28 . 
  i am all for a reform of it . 
  did we ? 
  i just heard about a rumor of an opa from pepsi against danone , then the government flex its muscle and that was it . 
  you `` evil bastards '' just do stuff wrong !, 
  the money of the cap is used mainly to subvention the prices at the exportation , not so much on development , so it does n't matter for how long each country has received money , as long as this politic is in order , the agricultural countries are going to benefit from it . 
  after the war i guess the cap had a reason to be , at least for the eu of then . 
  now it just serve as a way of protectionism , so that our agriculture does n't get outsourced to developing countries i guess ? 
  in france only 3 % of the population are concerned i think . 
  hardly a necessity for our economy , but i guess it has a traditional value ? 
  i really do n't know . 
  but to be honest , if the cap were to be suppressed , or if certain post like wine and tobacco were to be reduced , the french government would simply give less money to the eu and use that money to subvention it 's agriculture on it 's own . 
  and then that would be a huge blow to the common market . 
  ( i used france as an exemple cause that the obvious one , but i am sure the same could be said for other countries ) . 
  so maybe the cap should n't be seen as a part of the eu budget , but a way for the countries to keep an eye on each others subvention ? 
  i really have no certainty in the subject . 
  but i tend to agree that there really is a lack of long term strategy on pretty much everything . 
  i disagree , turk people are still at a waypoint and they have to decide between a secular democracy and a muslim one , if they choose a muslim democracy , i do n't see any chance of them coming in any time soon , it would n't be accepted by the european countries . 
  that 's why everyone is interested by the protest right now . 
  many turks on the cost are secular , but the majority that live in the interior do n't believe in western value . 
  as for why we should care about iran , well iran still has a good chunk of azerbadjan in its grasp and could feel threatened by the little shaitan coming so close . 
  especially if we assume the islamic republic is still in control , with the propagation of same western value and what not . 
  and when iran feel threatened , it gives oil money to terrorist groups , and woulnd ' t have any problem to find or create some in azerbadjan . 
  culturaly , georgia and armenia are a lot closer to cyprus than aerbaijan , i guess it would depend upon wether turkey gets to join or not . 
  if they do , sure , no reason not to take the azeri . 
  but then iran might have something to say about it . 
  but really , a lot of things would have to change in good for that to happen . 
  you 're right , my mistake , still , them having a shia muslim majority would potentially put us right in the middle of the religion war between sunni and shia , and i do n't know if that 's very wise . 
  i am not a specialist , but i think the idea is that half the money of the eu is used to build/improve the infrastructure of the less develloped european countries , so that they can be economically competitive . 
  like the subvention for the highways in poland and the baltic countries . 
  when all the infrastructure are built , they wo n't need the subventions anymore . 
  then the other half is used for the pac . 
  never quite understood this one , everyone put money on the table then try to get it back . 
  it seems like a scheme to get money from germany as much as to protect the eu farmers from the rest of the world . 
  i am sure the eu does other things with it 's pocket money , but i am not quite aware of them right now . 
  i am alright with georgia and armenia , but azerbaijan really ? 
  that would put us right in the middle east ... and i do n't see any good coming out of that , even in 50 years ... 
  if i also remember correctly , even if all eu members are supposed to join the euro in an indefinite future , you still have to ask for it first , then your population have to agree , then you have to meet the eurozone standart , then finally you 're in . 
  so really , it 's up to them . 
  it does n't matter how huge we are as long as we are divided , right now saying eu 's economic might is like saying asia 's might . 
  china can easily play one eu country against the others , even using our own political system to bypass us . 
  we 're just like a big cheesecake to them . 
  sometime i think you guys should have stayed in your efta club , instead of trying to transform the eu into it . 
  the commonwealth always had the intention of creating a political union , schuman declaration was clear on it , which is precisely the reason why the uk did n't join it at first . 
  how this political union should take form is n't yet quite clear , even fifty years later , but we will get there ... 
  friendly teasing aside , i hope the uk will be with us , we would miss your fish and fries, 
  yes . 
  you would get in jail for voluntary manslaughter . 
  quite recently a shopkeeper got seven year in jail for killing a burglar with a hunting rifle . 
  if you think about soul in term of consciousness , then you can rephrase the question like this : `` does self consciousness define humanity ? '',

  my frankish ancestors are laughing at yours in valhalla ( or whatever the germanic paradise is called ) . 
  macedonians ( of fyrom ) are slavic people similars to the slavs from bulgaria . 
  there is no relation between them and the macedonians from alexander . 
  it 's just the name of the later roman province , which included more territories than the historical macedonia of alexander . 
  then the bulgarians ( or some other parent slavic tribe ) settled in that province . 
  it 's just a cool name to have . 
  the historical macedonia of alexander is mostly in greece now . 
  greece does n't want the slavic neighboring country to be named `` macedonia '' , because of national pride of course , but also because as you know , the greek region of macedonia has a big minority of slavic people ( macedonians and bulgarians ) . 
  they fear that the republic of macedonia is trying to build an historical claim on their territory of macedonia , ( `` let 's reconquer the territory of our ancesters `` kind of thing ) , or that the slavic minorities would want to secede kosovo-like and join the republic . 
  i do n't think there is any ground to their fears , but , who knows . 
  hollandais works too . 
  it 's probably be better in fact . 
  depending with whom you speak . 
  thanks !, 
  i am sure we are doing our best !, 
  i just saw an allegation coming from a disgruntled competitor . 
  nothing that prove that france was caught in the act of industrial spying , or that we do it more than any western country . 
  i mean , more spying than the nsa ? 
  come on ... 
   it 's not a western value to disrespect religion . 
  maybe it 's a french value , but it 's not an american value , therefore please do not present it as a western value .

and that is why we go for the diplomatic victory in civ games, 
   they often consider themselves coming from a specific region rather than `` french '' . 
  for what it 's worth . 
  this has n't been my experience at all and it 's basically irrelevant for most people . 
  i 'm not judging your food on your ingredients .

  france is always one step ahead/behind the uk so yeah france would be ahead of scotland but it does n't matter as long as we are ahead of the uk !, 
  what 's important is how far down uk falls in term of world power . 
  if france is ahead by a good margin i 'll be satisfied !,

   another minister is forced to resign [ 5 ] due to tax issues .

  he paid them in full and more . 
  he paid 42000 $ and out of that 12000 $ were added because he was `` late '' .

   first comment maybe you should direct me to it because you are assuming i sort comment in the same manner as you do and i certainly do n't seeing as the first comment for me is totally irrelevant to the point i 'm making ( my first comment is by / u/xp100 talking about simeon ii ) . 
  once again this type of thread pisses me off because of the inaccuracies and missing elements . 
  for instance for the throne of france there are 3 families/dynasties that have a dispute about who would be king if there still was a monarchy . 
  there are the orleanists , the bourbons , and the bonapartists . 
  we have [ jean d'orleans ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b8/le_prince_jean_de_france.jpg/200px-le_prince_jean_de_france.jpg ) , [ louis de bourbon ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5d/louis_xx.jpg/200px-louis_xx.jpg ) , and [ jean-christophe napol\u00e9on ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f8/prince_napol%c3%a9on.jpg ) fun fact the orleanists and the bourbons tried to have the republic settle the matter . 
  and what did the republic said ? 
  `` fuck you we do n't give a fuck about your shit '' .

  that 's not an excuse , that 's just the way things are . 
  at least for those who protest and are openly against jews . 
  you have to be stupid to leave france for a country where it 's a possibility that you will receive a bomb on your head . 
  these demonstrations have been happening in other countries too and i 've been wondering what 's the point . 
  what are these people trying to accomplish . 
  do they think their government is going to do something ? 
  do they think it makes one side or the other feel good about being supported ? 
  can someone explain ? 
   i 'm french leaving in the uk that 's a freudian slip in all its glory . 
  it 's a squat with roma , they do n't go to school , their children do n't go to school ( they could if their families wanted them to ) . 
  they ca n't speak french very well and most of the time ca n't write nor read . 
  and that 's why you are an evil white oppressor . 
  the rest of us have a problem with condemning people to die for the sole crime of trying to get a better life for themselves ... 
  i like that is it shaped like a rooster which is one of the [ symbol of the french people ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gallic_rooster ) . 
  that 's why it 's unlikely to stop them from crying . 
  you are always angry anyway . 
  but i have to admit i 'd be always angry too if i lived somewhere where the sun barely ever show its face . 
  i have no idea why you were downvoted because it 's the truth . 
  the french president is such a position that he literally ca n't afford any social unrest , which cancelling this trade would create . 
  recently a poll that asked to the members of his party `` if the election were tomorrow what would be the best candidate '' he was the [ choice of only 3 % of them ] ( http://www.lefigaro.fr/flash-actu/2014/05/29/97001-20140529filwww00157-exclusif-le-sondage-choc-qui-fait-trembler-le-ps.php#xtor=al-155-[twitter] ) . 
  for someone currently in office this is very low . 
  i 'd wager it matches the unemployment in these ages brackets . 
   this is an attempt to increase sarkozy 's popularity . 
  i do n't think this is an `` attempt '' . 
  sarkozy has always wanted and worked to create a strong franco-german `` couple '' . 
  it 's even more apparent now that we have francois hollande because of the lack of visits in germany . 
  this is maybe one of the things he is really sincere about . 
  eurovision has never been about who makes the best music . 
  you just need to check the salaries of people graduating from those universities to see that the third ranking is just bullshit . 
  i 'm not gon na admit the same . 
  basically nothing is a moral issue in france lol . 
  if you rank by `` not a moral issue '' france is first overall . 
  because we socialize with co-workers especially at lunch . 
  moreover we have `` latin '' hours . 
  we eat diner a lot later than the anglo-saxons at around 8pm . 
  maybe because there is both jews as a religion and a people , you can be one without being the other . 
  i do n't understand this ... 
  technically we use it in france . 
  so for 10 ^ 12 we should say `` billion '' , but most of the time we the expression `` millier de milliard '' or the si prefixes . 
  for instance , `` le pib de x est d'environ trois mille milliards de dollars '' `` the gdp of x is about three thousand billion of dollars '' . 
  i would n't use `` les guignoles de l'info '' as any measure of anything period . 
   today france is very pessimistic and feels very weak . 
  more or less true  everybody thinks `` if we go to war we 'll lose '' , that 's only your opinion  but not only about war , we also think germans are better than us ... we think german economy is better than ours and should be taken as an example . 
  but not that germans are better than us . 
   french people are concerned by the economic crisis , and russia is viewed as a big country too big for us . 
  also true , but as you said the reality is that we are not so weak . 
  france is still a member of the un security council , one of the rare country able to project its military force around the world , we are still in the top 10 of world economies , and we have a little less than 500 nuclear warheads . 
  plus our foreign policy is pretty much seen in good light all around the world ( less fuck ups in our military interventions than to the us ) . 
  i think if it came to the worse france would rise up to expectation and be a big part in the defence of the eu . 
  yes that 's correct . 
  do n't misunderstand . 
  i think it has to do with some sort of football championship . 
  anything east of germany and north of greece does n't exist basically ...

  you can look on the [ fnac ] ( http://bilheteira.fnac.pt/pesquisa/page/1?district=42&amp;subcategories=&amp;category=&amp;venue=&amp;pricefrom=&amp;priceto=&amp;datefrom=&amp;dateto=&amp;search=&amp;utm_source=mmbilheteira ) site . 
  just pick musica for categoria and classica or concerto for subcategoria and change the dates, 
  he did n't renounce his french citizenship , he 's just a dual citizen now . 
  but anyway he 's seen as being a legendary actor and personality and even if he does weird and crazy stuff i think people still like him overall . 
  we do n't take what he says or does very seriously . 
  he 's kind of part of our identity in a way , like the eiffel tower and baguettes . 
  most of them yes but refrigerated trucks are allowed to drive on sundays . 
  exactly , it 's a nightmare . 
  at least there 's very little trucks on sundays ... 
  i think it 's 2 years if i remember correctly . 
  you have to put a `` a '' sticker ( for apprentice ) at the back of your car . 
  yeah . 
  i know we got ta eat but all these trucks really make me nervous : - /, 
  true ... 
  no i do n't . 
  and i 'm just thinking about op , it 's nicer not to be freezing cold when traveling . 
  how is having `` nobody 's there '' a minus ? 
  sounds pretty nice in my book . 
  why not ? 
  central europe can be depressing visually during winter . 
  highways are good and maintained , the only bad thing about them is all the trucks on it ( from all over europe ) . 
  the speed limit is 130 kmh . 
  110 for new drivers or when there 's bad weather . 
  minimum speed is 80 kmh . 
  you can get a little box that you put inside your car so that you do n't have to stop to pay for it , the automatic lanes are faster too . 
  even if you have homework you usually do n't have homework in every subjects so that still helps with the heavy bag . 
  plus even if you have to carry the books to school at least when you arrive you can put them in the locker and not have to carry them all day . 
  another solution would be to give two sets one that stays at school one that stays home . 
  or the teacher could give homework where you do n't need the textbook . 
  having a locker is still better than not having one in every situation imaginable, 
  as you said not much history because it 's so new so it 's a bit bland and boring to us . 
  i guess new york would be the historical capital for me . 
  we have to bring our books every morning that 's my point . 
  what do you mean ? 
  you can see russia from my house, 
  how dare you !, 
  one country uses two different taps for hot and cold water . 
  that country is known as being perfidious but i 'm not gon na name names . 
  no they are n't :( only boarders had lockers at my school . 
  shout out to the us and their lockers in schools . 
  it still baffles me that we have n't implemented this . 
  brussels . 
  my french heart wants to say strasbourg though but that just would n't be true . 
  it was pretty easy 10 years ago tbh , i did it all the time except when with people that `` do n't want to read '' lol . 
  almost 10 years ago . 
  so you 're saying now all foreign films are showed with subtitles and not dubbed ? 
  i have a hard time believing it . 
  i 'd say no , a majority of french people like dubbed better ( a lot of people do n't even have the option ) . 
  when i was living in paris when seeing a movie dubbed the theatre would usually be full , when with subtitles i 'd say maybe 1/3 to 2/3 full so less popular . 
  yeah , i wish we could see them in just vo too :(, 
  dubbed but in big cities you can chose to see them in vost ( original language with french subtitles ), 
  i also enjoy vintage space and real life lore !, 
  i 'm gon na check your other recommendations for sure !, 
  here 's some that i think people reading this sub might enjoy . 
  [ arika okrent ] ( https://www.youtube.com/channel/ucsabq0fvcfj2hmokn3f__8q ) she makes video about the etymology of words ( while a guy draws the explanations ) [ crash course ] ( https://www.youtube.com/user/crashcourse/playlists ) they have fun and entertaining courses about philosophy , history , mythology , computer science etc. 
  [ lessons from the screenplay ] ( https://www.youtube.com/channel/ucerssa3cap_gjxmfpdjg9jw ) it 's a guy analysing famous scenes and explaining why it works . 
  [ simone giertz ] ( https://www.youtube.com/channel/uc3keomznz8eynwbc34rakcq/videos ) a swedish girl that got youtube famous by making shitty robots ( they work but they are useless ) . 
  now she also makes other silly sciency vids . 
  [ lindsay ellis ] ( https://www.youtube.com/user/chezapoctube/videos ) a girl that explains myths in pop culture like `` is beautify and the beat about stockholm syndrome '' or `` loose canon aphrodite '' where she looks at all the time aphrodite appeared on tv and film and comments on it . 
  [ critikal ] ( https://www.youtube.com/channel/ucq6vfhwmzcmxbukyg7sqyig ) it 's a guy playing video games but his commentary is just hilarious it 's not your usual dudebro shit . 
  i prefer regular american accent because it 's the one i 'm used to the most and so it 's the one the less noticeable for me and the most immersive . 
  i do n't like when i have to think about or wonder what the characters are saying because it takes me out of the story . 
  but it 's not that big of a deal i usually put the subtitles on anyway . 
  the only thing i hate are french characters with british accents , makes me want to vomit . 
  nothing or slippers , and flip flops in summer, 
  and blue by eiffel 65 !, 
  ah good to know !, 
  i better not hold my breath in the hope of seeing them in france though lol, 
  very important , we find cool stuff all the time . 
  just last week it was announced that they found a `` little pompeii '' in the rh\u00f4ne department . 
  [ a roman site ] ( http://scd.france24.com/fr/files_fr/imagecache/home_1024/article/image/02082017_little_pompeii.jpg ) of 7000 m2 . 
  i do n't know about the schools though sorry . 
  i think you can see aurora borealises in island , finland , sweden and norway so maybe them . 
  pretty much everybody knows d\u00e9jeuner en paix . 
  he 's liked but it 's not like we talk about him a lot . 
  nice accent when singing . 
  we already pay kidnappers/terrorists when they have french citizens . 
  it 's not official and not talked about but everybody knows . 
  the opinion is that it 's fine because if it were you or one of your family member being kidnapped in the desert you would want your government to do anything possible to save you . 
  sure it sets a precedent but i do n't think kidnapping a us citizen is less sought out than kidnapping a french one so in the end it does n't really matter . 
  op brought up the commonwealth , not / u/werkstadt, 
  casse toi une jambe is just `` break a leg '' translated it 's not a true french idiom , only people speaking english would say that . 
  and they would sound silly in my book . 
  that 's exactly what he 's saying ... 
  yes . 
  speaks english = anglosphere . 
  simple as that . 
  thanks for the confirmation that nobody knows that word haha well we learned something , 
  yes i have heard about it too . 
  after the terrorist attacks schools started doing it . 
  understandable but heartbreaking . 
  yeah , is n't barouche used in english ? 
  i had to look up the word because i did n't know what it was called , we call it `` cal\u00e8che '' . 
  i should have said horse carriage :d, 
  merde meaning shit . 
  we often say `` j' te dis merde ! '', 
  `` i tell you shit ! '', 
  because saying `` good luck '' would be jinxing it . 
  it comes from the time when people used barouche to go to the theatre . 
  if a lot of horse shit was in front of the theatre it meant your play was successful .

  i do n't like this phrasing - the question is n't whether the farmer is allowed to sell his goods , it 's about whether others are forced to buy them . 
  agreed , i 'm all for incentives for reducing greenhouse gas footprints , but ( i think we all agree ) the new romanian law proposal is n't a particularly effective way to do that . 
  the carbon tax would definitely work better . 
   the market has an obvious way to solve this problem for them , namely , have the weakest small players go out of business so that their farms are bought by someone else and thus consolidated in larger , more suitable farms . 
  there are other , less brutal ways , such as a local middleman making a profit by buying from many local farmers in a way that 's convenient for them , and then reselling at supermarkets , taking care of the logistics , shelf space and paperwork issues . 
  a lot of things `` have been said many times '' , that does n't make them true . 
  i , for one , would be happy to see scotland stay in the eu without needing to jump through any hoops . 
  i 'm not a eu official , but i 'm not the only one with that view either . 
  i understand that spain ( and , to a much less extent , france ) grumbles a bit because it does n't want catalonia to follow the example so it does n't want the eu encouraging separatism , but i think the situation is different enough ( scotland is * already * pretty independent ) that it * could * work . 
  time to put hadrian 's wall back in service ? 
  ( yes , i know it 's not in the right place ) it 's hard to tell how the whole `` freedom of movement '' thing will play out , but i expect that most concerns over illegal immigration are from the channel ( eurotunnel , boats ) , i would find it surprising if migrants found a way to to scotland and then went to england from there ... 
  you forgot to include an argument or explanation or evidence . 
  that 's what treaties are supposed to clarify . 
  agreed , it 's an exaggerated simplification , that glosses over a lot of important stuff . 
  no thanks . 
  encryption is just so * easy * to do that you ca n't prevent it without also preventing a * lot * of potentially useful stuff . 
  and even then you wo n't make much of a dent in terrorists ' communication capabilities . 
   but she has argued that scotland may not have to give up its eu membership even if it stays part of the uk . 
  oh , i had n't thought of that possibility . 
  a bit weird , but could work - a bit like a reverse greenland ( greenland is out of the eu but also part of denmark who is in the eu ) . 
  no , you want to force poor little old romanian ladies to buy more expensive romanian vegetables instead of cheaper ones from abroad - by forcing the supermarkets to * sell * those vegetables for a higher cost ( from the little old lady 's point of view it 's the same thing ) . 
  this is pretty much equivalent to taking some money from the poor little old ladies ( and everybody else ) and giving it to romanian farmers , with some of it being loss in the process because of all the new paperwork and tracking and inspection that 's needed . 
  in other words , let 's take some of your money , burn part of it , and give the rest to someone else in your country who may not even need it more than you , making everybody 's life more complicated in the process - but if you phrase it the right way you can make it sound patriotic ( because that guy you 're giving the non-burnt money is from * the same country as you !, 
  * ) and people who have n't been paying attention will cheer !, 
  and boo at the mean old eu bureaucrats who are trying to prevent that out of sheer hatred of romanians . 
  yes , they definitely should . 
  provided the buyer knows the product 's quality , who is harmed by the exchange ? 
  why do you ( presumably , from your '' / s '' ) want to step in and prevent them ? 
  ( replying to a deleted comment - eh , i 'll post it anyway )  we have a pretty idiotic situation where a lot of our own locally grown food is exported or local farmers just barely scrape by while we import most of our food if that was the whole story , then supermarkets could be expected to save money by cutting out the middle man and directly buying from local farmers . 
  i do n't imagine supermarkets leaving free money on the ground ( [ as the joke goes ] ( https://financingefficiency.wordpress.com/2011/10/19/the-20-bill-on-the-sidewalk/ ) ) , so there must be more to the story . 
  one likely explanation is that romania alone does n't produce a very large diversity of food ( both in terms of `` kinds of things '' and `` in which season is it available '' ) , because it 's globally more effective to have countries each specializing in what they do best , and selling most of it abroad , rather than have each country try to produce a bit of everything for every season . 
  there could be plenty of other factors too . 
  if every country in europe did this , then everybody would be worse off , period - including `` small romanian farmers '' . 
  so of course the eu does n't want only * some * countries to do this . 
  that 's the eu doing it 's job to find agreements that make everybody better off ( `` no protectionism '' is such an agreement ) . 
  so , yay eu !, 
  that also happens without the eu , it 's just your everyday political drama . 
  * because together , we are stronger than alone ( do you want your country to get walked over by russia , china , the us ? ), 
  * because all of europe 's cultures are * interesting * - worth visiting , worth talking to , worth eating * because life is just * simpler * if we do n't have to deal with currency exchange and visas and borders when travelling or working abroad * because we share enough cultural elements and background to feel united as europeans - the roman empire , christianity , knights & castles , the enlightenment , the fact that at various points in time we all tried to invade all europe , etc. 
  what else would you want them to say ? 
  `` we have absolutely no evidence but it 's probably an islamist '' ? 
  the headline scared me for a moment , then i was so relieved to see that * this one * was n't in france !, 
  they laughed at our idea of a european army ... well now we have * orbital lasers * so we 'll see who has the last laugh !, 
  man , that sounds like a great plan , i wish it was true . 
  reminds me of the old joke  rabbi altmann and his secretary were sitting in a coffeehouse in berlin in 1935 . 
  `` herr altmann , '' said his secretary , `` i notice you 're reading der st\u00fcrmer !, 
  i ca n't understand why . 
  a nazi libel sheet !, 
  are you some kind of masochist , or , god forbid , a self-hating jew ? '', 
    `` on the contrary , frau epstein . 
  when i used to read the jewish papers , all i learned about were pogroms , riots in palestine , and assimilation in america . 
  but now that i read der st\u00fcrmer , i see so much more : that the jews control all the banks , that we dominate in the arts , and that we 're on the verge of taking over the entire world . 
  you know -- it makes me feel a whole lot better ! '', 
  you 'd have they would have learned after saddam , but noooo , sarkozy * had * to go try to prove he was a real man \u2122 too . 
  yeah , that 's a pretty good reason  and not one that has an easy way around , it does require some pretty delicate diplomacy ... 
  i 'm not arguing for or against structural reform , i 'm saying that the article is calling for outcomes everybody approves of ( more employment , less red tape ) , while criticizing reforms that are aimed at obtaining those very same outcomes . 
  it 's as if i went to some company 's ceo and said `` hey , your middle management is doing things wrong - they should be trying to * make money * and instead they 're wasting time on things like market research , product design , focus groups , recruitment and cost control , which are expensive and harmful for the company '' . 
  it * might * be true that those things are not good ideas , but i provided no arguments for that . 
  that 's how i feel about the fn . 
  is that paragraph supposed to feature explanations for unemployment and red tape ? 
  because `` structural reforms '' sounds like what you could call attempts to cut down read tape . 
  and unemployment can be reduced both by cutting social safety net ( which increases demand for jobs ) and removing regulation that protects workers ( which increases supply of jobs ) . 
  there 's a tradeoff to be found between encouraging employment and protecting workers & the disadvantaged , but this article basically pretends the tradeoff does n't exist and problems come from those evil ( imaginary ) people who believe in trickle-down economics . 
  yes , i never understood why they do n't just dump them back on the lybian coast , or wherever the boat comes from . 
  sure , it 's a bit mean , but so are most effective ways of dealing with broken laws . 
  meh , i had hoped for more analysis , it reads like a bunch of generalities most everybody agrees on . 
  for example , who disagrees that full employment would be good ? 
  that less red tape would be good ? 
  some * analysis * on why we have red tape and unemployment , but the article doesn ' offer any . 
  and the mention of trickle-down economics is a ridiculous straw man , i do n't think i heard anybody actually advocate that . 
  good luck figuring out who is or is n't part of a violent cult ( yes , i know you probably meant islam as a whole , but in my experience most muslims have a pretty healthy approach to religion ) , let alone writing the criteria down in law ... 
  ... and i 'd like to know * why * it has the lowest score . 
  i wish there were more anti-immigration but pro-europe parties ... or at least , anti- `` bad '' immigration ( poor people from war-torn or backward countries ) . 
  um , unlike the dead kid on beach , i do n't think this will make westerners very sympathetic of refugees ... 
  why ? 
  i can understand finland 's high score ( `` successfully kept russia out '' is no mean achievment ) , but what 's going on in bulgaria ? 
  i 'm all for christian proselitism aimed at refugees - it might help integration and , more importantly , pisses off the islamists . 
  i 'm [ working on it ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/france/comments/4v5u93/la_france_a_besoin_dun_gouvernement_pour_se/d5vpiqf ), 
  i for one do n't mind the proposal !, 
  that 's a good idea !, 
  not that it has much chance of actually being implemented ... 
  but yesterday it was france and frexit !, 
  and the day before it was italy and it 's banks !, 
  the week before it was germany !, 
  earlier this year it was greece !, 
   why did n't universal culture begin in communities that have had long-term prosperity and stability before europe did ? 
  because they got invaded by the mongols , which stopped whatever progress they were having in their tracks ? 
  figuring out why the enlightenment and the industrial revolution happened in the west is * hard * . 
  geography ? 
  columbus ? 
  access to a big continent ? 
  protected from the steppe raiders ? 
  the competition between the small polities ? 
  the philosophical tradition ? 
  common law ? 
  christian values ? 
  climate ? 
  superior genes ? 
   the west had a technological head start because of our philosophical and social traditions . 
  i do n't buy that .

  really . 
  my gps was ringing all the time . 
  also , italy does it on the full length of the motorways . 
  that 's what everybody says , but i guess most people will just be too scared to be caught with it . 
  i heard you would get 8 points ( out of 12 on your license ) and a big fine . 
  in the french news , everybody says that they 're waiting for more information , some kind of proof , a trial , whatever . 
  nobody can believe that really happened as described . 
  if it 's some kind of trap , that would be really disgusting because he 's risking to be unable to run for the next presidential election , and he was the one that had the maximum chances of beating sarkozy 's right wing party . 
  the socialist party 's primary elections ( to internally elect their candidate for 2012 ) are in july to october . 
  it 's better to take control of institutions instead of just mumbling alone without taking any responsability . 
  and strauss-kahn have an image of right-leaning left-wing politician in france , especially on foreign politics . 
  we say he 's from `` drauche '' , literally `` reft '' ( right/left ) . 
  having a good highway system is n't incompatible with an extensive rail system . 
  in france , the rail system has been developed by the state , and is pretty good ( although we complain a lot about the rail company , sncf , because we love to complain ) . 
  the highways have always been paid by private companies ( so of course they 're not cheap to use ) and are pretty good quality . 
  this have always [ been a debate ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/autoroutes_of_france#administration ) because some people says that the state should own them , but at least it allowed to afford it, 
  that 's true , but do n't think that it 's the case everywhere in europe . 
  if you live and work in a big city , you can use public transportation , but outside of it you really need a car . 
  but i agree that it 's still better than the us . 
  i 'd like to hear the point of view of some pro-socrates portugueses . 
  i can imagine this kind of video against any french politician done by another party . 
  easy to do and not really objective . 
  just one thing : why is it aimed at finland ? 
  should n't they be concerned by the decisions of the whole eu ? 
  except french . 
  that 's what a greek official said : they do n't like this kind of rumors as it makes their situation more difficult ( by decreasing the trust in the country ) . 
  yes , but i live in the uk now , and the border control annoy me at the airport every time . 
  come on , you have to wait ... more seriously , this is the point of schengen . 
  before it , it was easy to cross the border as well , but i still believe it was a great step forward . 
  you should be doing [ this ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxvdu2evysg ) . 
  what bothers me the most is that they can assassinate someone without a trial , and do so in a foreign country without even notifying the officials ( they 're not even at war in this country ) . 
  i do n't get why pakistan government does n't complain . 
  i do n't really know what to think of that . 
  it does n't really sound good . 
  these women were arrested for not having declared their protest , not because they wore a burqa . 
  and they were freed a few hours later without any charge . 
  of course it is . 
  there is no reason to act in the heat of the moment like this . 
  the first thing to do would be to continue to exploit plant as usual until we can analyse what happened clearly without letting emotion in the way . 
  you ca n't rely on wind and solar only . 
  you 'll never produce enough . 
  an example : germany is supposed to be a leader in these domains , they have a lot of wind and solar power , and it represent only [ 1.5 % of their consumption ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/energy_in_germany#consumption ) . 
  denmark has the most wind power per person , and they still produce [ 70 % of their electricity with fossil fuels ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/electricity_sector_in_denmark#electricity_pro_person_and_by_power_source ) . 
  [ hmm , no , not here . 
  i ( and a flemish friend ) confirm ( a ) . 
  and that 's the case for all european students ... 
  yes , i live in the uk now . 
  and what was difficult for me was the night at 4pm . 
  it guess it depends on your habits . 
  it 's a normal british reaction . 
  your body is allergic to every normalization with the rest of europe . 
  it does n't need to change . 
  but it would give 1 hour more of sunshine in the afternoon . 
  come on ... all the french with an equivalent of a bachelor speaks enough english . 
  of course , the accent is [ outrageous ] ( http://i23.photobucket.com/albums/b367/4runninfun/frenchtaunt.gif ) , but the language is usually not that bad . 
  i 'm french and live in the uk , and i agree that would be more logical but less practical . 
  this winter i was really impressed by the hour the sun sets . 
  at 15h30 you already have no lights ... quite depressing . 
  but what if you look from a british perspective ? 
  you want to go to war , but you ca n't . 
  that would n't be acceptable as well . 
  in this particular case , i agree , i think it was a mistake . 
  but in general a country should be able to use their army . 
  edit : when i said british , i meant british government . 
  but you got me . 
  what would be correct then ? 
  ( i even saw the explanation video some time ago but ... :-), 
   note : the uk is more than just england  i did n't pay attention , sorry . 
  i should use `` british '' i guess . 
  ( corrected ), 
  my belgian friend says that the worst is that some people are actually wondering why they need a government , because the situation is still fine ( he mean that nothing is falling apart , people are fine ) . 
  i do n't know precisely about this treaty , maybe some interrested people can find flaws , but i like the idea of sharing military capability . 
  it will help reduce the cost of military . 
  since european countries wo n't go to war against each other , the only problem is when one country wants to go and not the other ( like iraq ) . 
  that 's why i think we should try to share military costs but still keep independence on the actual interventions . 
  maybe in the long term , that would be possible , but we still disagree too much on some important decisions . 
  so you can share support , formation , some equipment , but not the actual fighting personnel . 
  i would n't find acceptable to have french soldiers in iraq because a treaty force them to follow the british . 
  this is not the first share of resources btw , i know that belgian pilots train in france . 
  ok , i agree on this ( as long as she 's really guilty ) . 
  but if she is declared guilty in france , she would not ( normally ) go free . 
  it would n't be 60 years but she would make some prison . 
  you seem much more informed about mexico than me :-) i agree about the problem of separation of power , and if the same thing happened with france i do n't think we would free the victim . 
  the issue is that the french want her to get a fair trial . 
  most persons are not concious of these democracy problems in mexico and this is n't really their business . 
  but this women should n't have to be sacrificed to arrange a democracy she 's not from . 
  that 's not what her defence says . 
  her version is that she did n't know about all this . 
  i do n't know if it 's true or not , but the mexican justice has lost its credibility as well . 
  it has been revealed that at the beginning they 've used false witnesses . 
  no , me neither . 
  the problem is more that the french do n't trust mexican justice , and she still says she 's innocent , so the government would want a trial the french can trust . 
   it 's possible , even results in a temporary reduction of accidents . 
  ok , it 's possible but very complicated and expensive . 
  and the reduction of accidents was due to the fact that vehicle were already left-hand drive . 
  anyway , i do n't think the uk will ever consider that . 
  they do n't have borders ( except with ireland , which drives on the left side ) , they have right-hand drive cars . 
  and they are very keen on keeping the maximum of differences with other european countries . 
  it seems not to be the only reason , but national pride is definitely the reason for the uk . 
  a british once explained me that whatever happens , he will never accept that the uk bills does n't display the queen .

  conservatives have a majority and wo n't be calling an election for three more years . 
  eu slaps down sturgeon : snp leader dramatically announces she wants ` immediate discussions ' to stay in eu ... but she is humiliated as brussels says ` no , that 's not how it works ' '' eu already told them to pound sand . 
  google it because link wo n't work here . 
   `` the issue of a ` partial withdrawal ' was ruled out in a briefing note sent to meps by the european parliamentary research service . 
  the document -- seen by this newspaper -- confirmed that ` part ' of a member state ` can not ... remain in the eu if the member state itself withdraws ' . '', 
  citation needed ? 
  seems like children are blindly upvoting whatever they want to be true . 
  it closed down -3.1 % on friday and is at -0.2 % right now in afterhours trading . 
  funny how people just blindly upvote your lies . 
  the one bank that people claimed were cutting jobs ( morgan stanley ) was a lie . 
  google it . 
  the pound is only down 6.2 % in afterhours trading back to levels seen in february . 
  i dispute the premise that it 's a bad thing as well canada had their currency drop 25 % in 2014 and they 've thrived more than any other country in the g7 in 2015 just last january in one month they had 0.6 % growth . 
  eu has to abide by wto minimums if you do n't know this basic fact you should n't be speaking a word about trade . 
  no but i also bought into project fear until i work up on saturday and seen what actually happened . 
  he 's right it 's pretty much inevitable at this point . 
  french , german and spanish equities all down more than 10 % in afterhours trading while ftse has almost fully recovered . 
  euronext set to drop another 10 % on monday . 
  major pension funds have said they 'll be investing untold billions into a free uk and the few stories about job losses like morgan stanley and game of thrones were lies . 
  now that the uk called the project fear bluff successfully greece and others will as well . 
  sad week for federalists . 
  pretty good chance unfortunately especially if our exchange drops another 10 % as is forecasted on monday . 
  why did ftse almost fully recover from the 3 % drop in afterhours trading ? 
  why are countries all over the world begging for a trade deal with the uk ? 
  why are foreign pension funds committing hundreds of billions to uk investment ? 
  people on all sides will be asking this which is scary . 
  your government says you spent # 72bn on infrastructure in 2014 on top of the eu funds so i do n't understand . 
  also any idea why am i being buried for asking a question about the article ? 
  seems very immature in my eyes but maybe i 'm missing something . 
  you 're quoting the closing rate on friday afternoon which is embarrassing and using gbpusd after all currencies slid against the worlds reserve currency . 
  even still it 's down 6.2 % in afterhours trading , back to levels seen in february . 
  i reject the premise that a 10 % drop would be terrible . 
  canada had their currency drop 25 % in 2014 and in 2015 they led the g7 in net new jobs per capita , had their exports increase by 12 % and gdp rose 0.6 % just in the month of january . 
  i think you 're mistaken as the ftse has almost fully recovered in after hours trading while the spanish/french/german exchanges are still down more than 10 % . 
  euronext looks like it 's going to lose another 10 % on monday as well which is especially frightening for people here in continental europe . 
  the few job loss stories ( hbo , morgan stanley ) turned out to be lies and some of the worlds largest pension funds have just committed untold billions to uk investment . 
  i would argue the exact opposite of what you 've wrote above . 
  http://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/canadas-largest-pension-funds-eye-post-brexit-bargains/article30609165/ http://business.financialpost.com/legal-post/brexit-wont-trigger-canadian-corporate-exits-from-britain, 
  most euroskeptics here are left in my experience there 's only the odd fn . 
   ca n't make up your mind . 
  brits made up their minds on the 23rd . 
  17,000,000 decided to leave and that 's what they shall do . 
  david cameron already confirmed there would n't be another referendum : https://i.imgur.com/7q68pkn.jpg, 
  it 's true but we 'll never admit it . 
  although it 's looking like you 're going to have liberated us once again . 
  french , german and spanish equities all down more than 10 % in afterhours trading while ftse has almost fully recovered . 
  major pension funds have said they 'll be investing untold billions into a free uk and the few stories about job losses like morgan stanley and game of thrones were lies . 
  showered with cash that the uk already gave to the eu right ? 
  my understanding from the article was that it was just money going from the left hand to the right hand to the left hand and that the uk was lucky to get 50 pence on the pound most years .

  i 'm looking at the euroskeptics currently leading half of eastern europe , fn leading polls here , netherlands freedom party calling for a referendum , denmark majority wants a referendum , afd/5 star on the rise and it sure does n't look to good for the eu right now . 
  why scaremonger ? 
  ask the eu why they went full project fear ( surprise all lies ) and why they 're continuing to do so in continental europe . 
  just wait until the turkey bribes stop working . 
  no more handouts for fyrom . 
  you clearly have n't even taken econ 101 . 
  canada 's currency dropped 25 % in 2014 and they had 0.6 % growth just in january , lead the g7 in net new jobs per capita last year , and had their exports grow by 12 % . 
  also people using usdgbp are ignoring the eur decline and that usd is the worlds safe haven when things look uncertain . 
  even considering that they 're four cents below 2013 levels in after hours trading . 
  project fear was just that . 
  one of the few . 
  probably more scaremongering/lies like the morgan stanley story that was debunked .

  french , german and spanish exchanges tanked while the ftse only dropped some mere 3 % and has recovered almost completely in after hours trading . 
  did you not see the json link ? 
  look at the picture again . 
   the rules of the online petition clearly state you ca n't be serious . . regardless cameron himself already said there would n't be another referendum . 
  17,000,000 people voted leave and they won by 1,000,000 votes but regardless only some 30 % of those signatures are from the uk , many are repeats and many are from people in the uk that are n't allowed to vote . 
   our principal ally has just surrendered its biggest conduit for influence over world politics . 
  i do n't think brits on either side care , with respect . 
  outright amnesty is an option so is fast tracked citizenship or perhaps they 'll introduce long term work visas . 
  i work in canada four months of the year and we do n't have a union . 
  it costs me a few hours and $ 60 cad/yr . 
  canada had their currency drop 25 % last year yet . . - just in the month of january they had 0.6 % growth - exports increased by 12 % year to year - they 've led the g7 in net new jobs per capita odd how everyone hates that china/japan devalues their currency yet this is the end of the world . 
  ftse is up 2 % . 
  are you willing to fight for the eu in the streets ? 
  surely seventeen million wo n't rise against you but a few million will . 
  11/18 voting for remain for reference, 
  15.2 m -  14.1 m ( and ever widening ) is an overwhelming win by any standards . 
  bbc used the exact same phrase . 
  they said this moment would be sweet and they sure did n't lie , 
  there 's a good chance the entire eu will collapse due to the overwhelming win for leave . 
  i for one am glad . 
  thank-you britain for liberating us once again .

i did n't knew that showing a tank or a fighter were reinforcing the `` good '' and `` peaceful '' idea of russia . 
  i think it 's more about not seeing the point of learning english . 
  current generation should see the things from another way , being born with internet and global markets . 
  we do n't like germany , but it 's not about the people themselves . 
  it 's more than we do n't like the german government . 
   pr\u00e4tk\u00e4hiiret ( biker mice from mars ) i remember watching this on tv . 
  they were pretty sexist . 
  what is the cost of an apartment in swiss ? 
  cause i am high school teacher ... in france . 
  and our salary is around 1500 $ at the beginning ... 
  rent would be around 1/3 of that here . 
  i 'm not sure i get it right ; are they calling it as a minimum salary , or for even unemployed people ? 
  if it 's the first one it would be 3 times our minimum salary ( around 1100 $ ) . 
  if it 's the second one , it would be 6 times the french 's equivalent ( around 450 $ ) . 
  i 'm pretty sure even our communist party would say it 's crazy ... 
  i heard there was a survey done with 3/4 against a strike . 
  i 'm surprised by these numbers , but heard them twice from different sources . 
  do n't worry ; i never heard of any frenchman who liked parisians . 
  also there 's more people today that are living alone than in the past ; meaning less people to eat it on a day . 
  there 's lots of breads that last for a few days , but a baguette is not made for that . 
  i 'm the only one who care more about the fact he can wear a 32/32 than the price ? 
  wait , on which products does this +1 y works ? 
  i did n't know about that law at all . 
  done ? 
  not really . 
  they 're putting it live on news channels ... like they want to bother us until the very end . 
  why no news here ? 
  because from the last survey , 79 % of french are tired of these protests . 
  but we still get it on each tv news . 
  when you look at the maps you do n't see the same thing ; first one , with all this red , show us where there 's lots of people , while the other map , focused on blue , show us where there 's no one . 
  i wonder if this was the goal of the guys doing these or not . 
  i do want a federated state of europe . 
  always wanted , and hope i 'll see it before my death . 
  maybe in 10 or 20 years , when the political landscape have changed even more than today , people will think again about it . 
  but for now , they do n't think about being a big power , only about how to make the others takes the fault and avoid being hit . 
  i spoke about the neighbourhood with a girl today , and she said she does n't like some communities around here ... while she said being herself an immigrant . 
  maybe the bad score of france is simply because we 're more honest than the others countries about what we think on this subject . 
  that 's not racism , only that there 's more poor guys on poor places , and so they have statistically more chance of being bad neighbours . 
  cause they are not common . 
  from what i saw as student and then as teacher , you get like 1-2 blonde haired girl ( s ) on a 30 + students class here in france ... that 's not much ... and i 'm not even on the brown part of the map . 
  an historian friend told me about that before , saying it was a fake made up by the germans themselves to motivate their troops . 
   there is no pan-eu media to create common topics euronews does n't count ? 
  is this a subtle plan from brits to makes us frenchies think they are closer to us than these strange beasts from the other side of the rhine ? 
  [ mvflg ] ( http://store.hipstery.com/blogs/news/6910694-how-to-be-german-in-20-easy-steps-part-3 ), 
  i 'm always barefoot in my house , must be due to my barbaric gallic ancestry . 
  i never tip , nor my friends , i was even pretty surprised seeing some pictures jokes from americans with a tip on the bill . 
  i 'm not from paris . 
  minimum wages in france being way higher than on others countries may explain why it 's not common for us . 
  also it seems people who do n't understand not having children are way higher on those who manifest against gay marriage . 
  but as he said , most people do n't really care . 
  it 's important for a group to be able to say `` no , you should really think more about this '' . 
  nothing say a vote will pass twice ( well here it would , but that 's just an example ) , so making it be revoted is not meaningless , and i 'm not even talking about the big loss of time . 
  well , to be fair , the way our president has the authority to send armies without asking our assembly for authorization help a lot on being the first one to move . 
  `` direct attack '' does not exist anymore on this century . 
  same in french , someday feminists will ask for language equity :p, 
  not like we 're good at choosing which place to sell anyway , you remember these lands around the mississippi ? 
  if they want to be closer to america , we may be willing to sell them guyana , no need to move anything , and they will even be on the same continent !, 
  in sale for a price ridiculously low , buy now !, 
  ** france : ** * it 's cold * war on mali * obama 's speech * gay marriage, 
   uk = slayers of virgins just for this the link was worth it . 
  maybe this example can work : from what i know our pre-school system is one of the best in europe , which help a lot women to work while having young children , which help parity . 
  okay , so it 's about closer history , thanks . 
  i should ask his opinion about that , but this subject is not easy , hard to say it was really the wrong decision for ww2 . 
  for the middle east , i think it 's purely political choices . 
  i asked a friend who is history teacher some weeks ago , and he was pretty surprised by this joke . 
  he said that if on the past ( i 'm talking until the 19th century + - ) the french 's army made a lot of mistakes it was because they were still using too much honor and not enough its brain ( like charging front-line when they could have won easily with a better tactic ) , so almost the total opposite of what the joke says . 
  i 'm curious to know from what this joke comes by the way . 
  from the things i heard on tv , france wo n't intervene here because he does not support current government , and so do n't want to take a side . 
  this article was pretty special , but well , i 'll answer the title ; as a french i do n't care at all about them . 
  i lost my last hope on him when he talked about democracy on russia . 
  and the people of his age i talked about said they never liked him ... which surprised me . 
  as for bardot ... well bob_goes_up said what i though when her last thing appeared on the news yesterday or the day before . 
  i though she was dead . 
  also for those that forgot ; taxes are paid on the country where the money is made ; this will only change taxes he pays for his personal stuff , not for his movie business , nor for his wine . 
  what really bothered me is him talking about the beauty of the russian 's democracy . 
  well at least , after this i learnt that it 's not only my mom who never liked it , but all people from her generation . 
  i wonder who still like him in france ... 
  well given they just ended their leaders issues , they are on full tinfoil hat about this being a trap from the government to make them out of money . 
  given how slow is french justice , it will takes a while before some real news about this , so in the meantime , we 'll get a lot of drama ... 
  they said the same thing about divorce last time . 
  in france you protest first , then you talk . 
  i know it 's special , but it 's quite common here . 
  during some time after the revolution french had the right to manifest , but not the right to have a syndicate to talk for them . 
  so they had no choice but to protest to make them heard . 
  even if it 's now history , we still works that way often , so numbers can be hard to compare with others countries on this type of things . 
  but still the big manifestation against marriage at the beginning surprised everyone by his size . 
  the surveys say that 60 % is for , but only 48 % for adoption . 
  the law is for both at the same time . 
  there were manifestation for and against . 
  given the crisis is still here , and due to our customs , it 's common for people to manifest against something only to say they do n't like the government , even if they do n't really care about the reason of the manifestation , so things against government will always have a bonus , it 's like how the dark side is more powerful as he can cheat . 
  i 'm pretty sure the law will pass . 
  it may take more time and a referendum , but i would be very surprised if it 's not adopted by the end of the year , or next year on the worst case . 
  not at all , i 'm tired of news about him :p well this one was funny at least : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k79iq_xluiq ( french ), 
  * gerard depardieu * the new ump 's drama * gay marriage, 
  same for me . 
  given i live in brittany , i would n't see the difference in name and weather with our friends on the island . 
  i did n't even though about it ... 
  you should try again the eu , it will work one day . 
  the japanese though the same thing on gundam 00 :p, 
  it 's true .

  xd guess we beat trump to the punch he ? 
   and piled into eu coffers . 
  it 's not ; - the end of the cartel means they have to lower prices means it 's not the eu that 's getting the bulk of the money ; it 's the consumer that do n't have to spend a fortune for it anymore - the money collected by the eu is redistributed in various programs ( whether it 's funding national debts , erasmus programs , administration wages , or the futur eu army programs , development of poland , agricultural subsidies etc ) . 
  that 's what collecting tax money was invented for in the first place . 
  now people might have disagreements on how things are budgeted , but joke apart , it 's not piled in a corner of a room just for a beast to sleep upon ha . 
  that 's more something private individual would tend to do when having a huge sum of money for themselves .

  why , you want to pay your next windshield 2000 # instead of 40 # next time you encounter a bolt on the highway because they ran a price fixing artificial monopoly ? 
  this is certainly welcome, 
   the fees proposed by the commission would also be capped at 4 cents per minute , 1 cent per sms and 0.85 cents per mb . 
  assuming this politico.eu webpage is around 15mb , and that surfing to it mean you likely used 100-150mb of surf , you already owe about 2 $ of overfee to the company . 
  now spend an hour of surf and you 'll owe easily already 50 $ . 
  do that a few days without knowing it and it 'll be 500 $ . 
  yep nope still not there . 
  sorry , can we stop enforcing 1970-era internet quotas and fees ? 
  `` by the mb '' quotas is absurd nowadays when an average gif picture is 20mb alone without accounting for the whole website around it . 
   consumers can only `` roam '' for 30 days at a time and only for a total of 90 days in a year we 're not really in an `` eu wide free market '' if i can only use my phone abroad 90 days/year without playing the constant sim card swapping game at every borders again is n't it ? 
  there has to be a way to have an eu wide working 5g that do n't stop working 90d after crossing a border ; and i 'm sure i could do without constantly swapping cards to bypass the issue or give half my income in fees to countless local telecom operators pfft, 
  that seem like proper justice , 
  ... are they 're kindah aware there is no such problem in the eu ( nor an independant uk ) ??? 
  : x we do have countlesss other issues like high level police corruption & political coverups of mps instead , but police brutality on black people is n't a thing neither in the uk nor continental europe . 
  furthermore by screwing with a runaway they 're only endangering more people , regardless of their ethnicities ( plane crashes do n't look at your skin color ) . 
  reneging on your word ? 
  :| that 's not going to do any good to the eu 's economy either . 
   the greek government is also not making much progress with the setup of a planned privatization fund , according brussels insiders . 
  ah yes always more of that extreme right thing that want to cut up what remains of greece and buy scrap of it for pennies . 
  always pushing for more `` privatization '' . 
  well ; skynews talking against blind unmanaged race to brexit ? 
  did the sky fell out when i was n't looking ? 
  this more realistic article is quite welcome coming from them . 
  crude sarcasm apart , they 're making some valid points here . 
  technically , if they remain in the eu free market throught the eea norway-style ( despite leaving the eu proper ) that might not be a problem tho ( since they 'd have to apply relevant eu trade law , which would likely satisfy the bulk of the businesses and industry ) . 
  the point that might stuck tho is that the uk will have to choose whether to follow their dream policy of closing down border on eu passeport holders to lash out at the poles like some so dearly want ( in which case they loose free market access and their citizens ' access to the continent ) ; or whether to remain in the free market throught the eea to maintain their economy ( in which case they ca n't single out eu citizens ) . 
  ( and please , do n't tell me the anti immigration wave is n't about poland ; it 's pretty obvious it 's the case and the press seem to agree : - / https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2016/06/28/britains-850000-polish-citizens-face-backlash-after-brexit-vote/ http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/26/racist-incidents-feared-to-be-linked-to-brexit-result-reported-in-england-and-wales http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-36656348 or even the recent murder ) \\ - obviously , as an eu citizen , i would suggest finding a solution to maintain the eu border open ( visa-free ) for people with proper valid paperwork on both sides ( illegal immigration will remain illegal and not allowed throught without proper paperwork obviously ) ; allowing the uk to stay in the eea and benefiting greatly from our market . 
  staying in the eea might also allow the uk to likely keep financial passeporting , which would prevent banking and financial service ( or other industries like japan 's here ) exodus accros the channel . 
  it would also allow english citizen to keep coming unimpeded to the eu or settle the `` hard border '' question with ireland for example . 
  the main `` price '' tho for the uk would be that they 'd have to explain why the polish citizens that come here likely are n't responsible for the crisis , and that attacking them in the streets will not solve the economic problem in any shape of form . 
  but that would also mean newspapers like skynews or the sun ( [ which drove the brexit ] ( http://geopolis.francetvinfo.fr/bureau-londres/files/2016/06/the-sun-brexit-lexpress-e1465901495850.jpeg ) , by [ blaming everything on eu immigrants ] ( https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/1502632/britain-must-set-out-clear-boundaries-on-immigration-as-we-prepare-to-negotiate-brexit/ ) ) would have to admit that the money missing from the economy is more likely [ due to corporations and billionaires being above taxes ] ( https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/apple-owes-145-billion-in-back-taxes-european-authorities/2016/08/30/e7f6ed80-6ea2-11e6-9705-23e51a2f424d_story.html ) embezzling [ billions per company ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/personalfinance/tax/9652516/foreign-firms-could-owe-uk-11bn-in-unpaid-taxes.html ) and [ ambiant corruption in the political elite ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_kingdom_parliamentary_expenses_scandal ) ( a hard target , since a lot of them are friends with the media 's owners ) ; rather than [ the few hundred euros of welfare some polish people collect ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/eu/9847650/why-are-we-sending-child-benefit-to-poland.html ) ( the easy scapegoat but a false target ) and/or [ some other hoax fantasy about the eu ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/50twnp/suns_imperial_up_yours_to_brussels_falls_down_on/ ) ( another convenient scapegoat for corruption frequently used too ) . 
  good news from and for the eu , 
  i 'm very happy to hear it  it is a landmark case in acting toward ending giant & utterly systematic corporate tax fraud in the multi dozen billion ranges . 
  for occidental countries , corporate taxes is one of the main sources of money that will allow us to keep maintaining the infrastructure and system ( from hospitals to education to utilities ) that made occidental countries the force they are today , and to keep being able to project ourselves in the futur as a superpower instead of a declining empire . 
  as for apple computers i 'm not worried about them , they are many dozens times richer than that ( both the company and it 's owners ) . 
  it is only normal they pay back part of their fair share to the society that made them so rich . 
  i 'm afraid you might find it a bit on the `` work work work '' side of things . 
  only thing left there right now is an old science research station and recruitement is probably as picky as antartica . 
  sure , can we use you as a voluntold beta tester ? 
  for some reasons , i 'm not sure it 's acceptable to toy and ruin emprisoned human lives just because you can . 
  i 'll leave the crass stuff to daesh and some others . 
  i 'm sure the short list can recognize itself < . <, 
  because building in a remote island at the other end of the planet with zero available space , zero infrastructure , no utilities , and where shipping half a kg by the post office costs 200 $ ( and where the closest viable shore is australia at 5000km from it , not counting antartica ) would somehow be cheaper than a refugee camp in continental france ? 
  they 're also known as the `` iles de la d\u00e9solation '' . 
  * desolation islands *, 
  well i guess we can always mass arrest anyone caught on the highway like that or doing other crimes and keep them in a cell till they remember whatever country they came from . 
  if anything that should keep people from repeating that & stop them from brutally disturbing daily life or attacking other trucks . 
  ( because if you make an ambush you make a choice hey . 
  the ppl implicated in that generally are n't victims . ), 
  except turkey is not actually attacking isis but ypg ... bollocks . 
  isis killing muslims , for a change, 
  haha, 
  neither faction does have those . 
  it 's telling that it 's the independant that post this . 
  looks like they 're pushing her character under a bus a couple years after her death ; so that it could n't be used against the tories anymore  the kingdom had been leaning towards a deal with france , until mrs thatcher 's intervention . 
  yuuuuuup . 
  :d `` hey france look how tatcher screwed you over 42b ! '' . 
  it 's blatant scapegoating, 
  well looks like they caught another daeshi from speischer, 
   the us has warned the european commission that it will consider retaliating if brussels goes ahead with plans to demand billions of dollars in unpaid taxes from apple and other us multinational companies . 
  i 'm sorry , does the treasurery really threathen us if we apply our laws in our countries and/or does not allow your corrupt friends to steal european budgets money ? 
   the white paper said the commission 's demand for retroactive tax payments `` sets an undesirable precedent that could lead to other tax authorities , particularly those in developing countries that look to the eu as a model , to seek large and punitive retroactive recoveries from both us and eu companies '' . 
  if you ca n't pay the time , then do n't do the crime . 
   he is islamising the education , forcing women to wear headscarves , advocating polygamy and forced marriages both of which are strictly forbidden in the chechen culture , advocating for islamist laws , have non-legal teams to look after what women are wearing and shooting paintballs to their dresses , advocated for some `` moral identity cards '' and above all , forcibly islamizes the chechen population with the kind of islam in his head . 
  he is a strict islamist , just a non-salafi one and a pro-kremlin one . 
  he is an actual islamist . 
  well , okay . 
  this is bad news then . 
   also has some weird reputation as `` red bearded snipers and berserkers '' like some bigfoot fables . 
  i never heard of anyone actually landing a shot on a real life big foot and taking pictures of it 's papers in cyrilic . 
  texan rednecks would have gone foaming long ago otherwise . 
  sadly jihadis are very real for their own part . 
   ever heard of kadyrov for example ? 
  he 's certainly a muslim and religious , but i 'm not sure whether kadyrov is an actual * islamist * or a bit of a warlord exagerating a bit his own personna on instagram ? 
   there is no salafism tradition in chechnya , they have been existing for a decade or two only . 
  salafism also does n't include female circumcision so nothing related . 
  i do n't know which denomination or branch of islam they worship , but a number of daeshis/nusra/arhar / jaish/whatever burried in northern syria definitly had russian papers and at least several came from chechenya or other caucausus republics/oblasts/whatever . 
   there is no such a huge number . 
  i saw litterally hundred of post mortem cases mentioned ( dead isis & similar jihadis coming from caucausus ) in a short few years . 
  while anecdotale and obviously biased , it 's certainly significant in my eyes . 
   well , it is a new kremlin habit that came with putin administration . 
  are you really telling me you say that putin & his circle are willfully appointing radical islamists in his own administration ? 
   if you 're talking about `` borderline alqaeda-grade fundamentalism '' as jihadism , sure they do n't . 
  if you 're talking about islamism quite frankly i 'm starting to label the whole thing as `` fundamentalist violent islam '' because whether they openly preach jihad or not those radical violent clerics tend to have very similar patterns and mentalities . 
  and i 'm starting to see them as a real danger to our ( well modern ) way of life ( the one from after 1900 , not the one from the dark ages . 
  i 'm sure you would rather have luminaries such as that that enlighted cleric preaching for people to mutilate themselves and each others . 
   chechnya has no such a traidition tell that to all those from there that joigned daesh  he is not from chechnya from one side of the caucasus or another  it 's really interesting how people are accusing chechnya and chechens without having a slightest idea . 
  that probably has something to do with the huge number of islamist fanatic that come from the area  there is also no such a thing as `` accidentally finding himself in some official position '' in russian federation . 
  kremlin is also known for backing various islamists accidentally as in `` not by kremlin decision '' . 
  while oppression , stalinism , rampant theft and suppression are definitely old russian habits , islamism fundamentalism definitely is n't one of those . 
  i would even suspect that key officials are ( always were , but did n't said so before ) actually russian orthodox and do n't really like borderline alqaeda-grade fundamentalism . 
  that look more like a radical from chechenya/nearby it that accidentally himself in some official position on basis of his religious fundamentalistic retardation background, 
  from 16 % .

of course not - france is famous for it 's food and old stone monuments , whereas mexico is a second-rate country that wishes it was first-rate , and is the butt of americans ' jokes . 
  obviously the two countries have nothing in common . 
   i 'm a lot more afraid of some neo nazis than of muslims . 
  i 'm more afraid of people texting while driving , or of restaurant owners & grocers skipping hygiene precautions , than of either of those . 
  til i 'm having an identity crisis . 
  so nz has to keep him until he comes up with $ 4000 ? 
  i 'm fine with that !, 
  by that logic , why distinguish all the slavic people ? 
  they also came from the same population originally . 
  or why distinguish germans , swedes , danes , austrians and icelanders ? 
  they all come from the same proto-germanic population somewhere in scandinavia . 
  or why distinguish americans , englishmen and australians ? 
  that fact is that * now * , the groups in france are fairly distinct , so using different names makes sense . 
  the two words are not synonyms . 
  like a lot of words ( especially when we 're dealing with translations ) , different people use different definitions and those definitions are all fuzzy . 
  go tell a spanish * gitano * that he 's a roma `` by definition '' . 
  heh , there seems to be ( at least ) two distinct groups , but no very good terms for distinguishing them . 
  to make things worse , i 'm sure you 'll be glad to hear that in france we often call them `` romanian '' ( i wonder which proportion of the population thinks `` rom '' is an abbreviation of `` romanian '' ? ), 
  ( after looking things up ) , hmm , actually `` tsigane '' may actually be a french term for the roms from the east , unlike what i 've said in the posts above , and * gitans * and `` manouche '' would be the local / spanish ones . 
  agreed some of that is bullshit , i mostly wanted to highlight the perceived gap between the gitano and the roma . 
  like a lot of terms it has irregular usage , but as far as i know , those in france we call * tsiganes * , * gitans * or * manouche * are usually considered `` non-roma '' , even though they have the same ancestors centuries ago . 
  the `` roma '' ( or `` rom '' or `` rroma '' or `` romanichels '' ) are more recently arrived ( in france at least ) from the east . 
  ( edit ) actually , maybe `` tsigane '' also designates the rroma from the east . 
  we have non-roma gypsies in france but they 're mostly fine ( as far as i can tell , i know a few ) . 
  see also [ this old thread ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askreddit/comments/1f3bok/what_makes_europeans_hate_gypsies_so_much_are/ca6luag ) :  here in spain , there are gitanos , who are spanish gypsies . 
  the gitanos probably predate the spanish on the iberian peninsula , but the spanish , who are generally ridiculously racist , hate the gitanos ( except for the flamenco ) . 
  they call them thieves and lazy freeloaders and all the rest . 
  but get this , the spanish gitanos fucking despise the the roma gypsies . 
  they refuse to have anything to do with them and regard the roma as basically the scum of the earth . 
  i think that 's pretty telling . 
  i do . 
  i would rather they did n't live anywhere near me , but i also wish they lead happy and fulfilling lives , with as little conflict with the rest of society as possible . 
  california may be kinder to them than europe - after all , it * is * a place where weirdos thrive . 
  also good for the roma themselves . 
  is there a place we can chip in to help pay for the trip ? 
  as far as i know it 's mostly about the doctrine of [ non-refoulement ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/non-refoulement ) , which forbids sending people back to a war zone , or a country where they 'll be persecuted . 
  there 's also the idea that to drop people in a country , you better have that country 's authorization . 
  sure , i can understand people being unhappy about that , just like sarkozy 's electors would have been unhappy if he had legalized gay marriage . 
  i 'm in favour of politicians taking wise-but-unpopular decisions , though of course many will disagree over which decisions are really wise . 
   people hate on the left because they are too liberal ( they seriously pushed reforms the right never thought were possible in france ... then opposed them because they can never agree with their opponents ) and most right-wing candidates are promising us a liberal hell . 
  as someone who 's pretty pro-free-market , i 'm not complaining about this development . 
  ( and gadaffi ), 
  thanks for the account , it does help get a better picture of what 's going on !, 
  i ca n't find the source right now , but i saw a survey on tv comparing the popularity of the various candidates for the french public in general ( and * not * only people who usually vote to the right ) , and basically it was something like jupp\u00e9 around 60 % , nkm/fillon/copp \u00e9 / le maire around 50-55 % , and sarkozy in the 30s or 40s ( i 'm going off memory , the details are probably wrong , and maybe fillon too ) . 
  i agree that surveys of people who will actually vote in the primaries give him a higher expected score ( but still below jupp\u00e9 ) . 
  i suspect a moist sandwich would win against le pen in the final round of the presidential election . 
  no need for `` the establishment '' - most people just do n't like the fn , with good reason . 
   forcing far left policies down peoples throats all over the world has forced people to go to the far right . 
  a fair amount of people complain ( in france at least ) that the eu has been about forcing right-wing ( more specificially , pro-free-market ) policies down peoples ' throat against their will . 
  sarkozy deserves a big chunk of the blame too ( which probably contributes to why he does n't have much of a chance in the coming election - he 's the least favourite candidate in the * r\u00e9publicains * primaries . 
  yeah , it 's very common . 
  you do n't have that in the states ? 
  ( assuming you 're american ), 
  i think that if there are places to avoid , it * is * a good thing to warn tourists about them , but this way of doing so is pretty bad . 
  they should have found a more politically correct way of doing so , for example : * specifically name the areas , or subway stations , or give a map * give a few indicators of a `` crappy part of town '' ( bars on windows ? 
  broken windows ? 
  a lot of littering ? 
  homeless people ? 
  nobody in the street ? 
  liquor stores ? ), 
  ... but i do n't know london nearly well enough to say what those signs would be . 
  i could say which parts of paris or nearby one should avoid though , and what kind of people one should be careful about . 
  the advice i 'd give in person would be pretty different from the kind of advice acceptable in an official publication . 
  [ you can talk ] ( http://ncf.idallen.com/english.html ) . 
  i do n't mind either , but / u/samuel79s above seems to have had a different experience ... of course it 's hard for me to tell how other french react to foreigners , but i do n't think that reputation is * entirely * undeserved . 
  well , [ part 2 ] ( http://www.itchyfeetcomic.com/2016/03/speaking-terms-part-2.html ) is the same idea with asian countries . 
  last polls on the republican primaries showed jupp\u00e9 had a significant lead there . 
  and i know people who voted for sarkozy in the past ( as i did ) , but are planning to participate in the republican primaries * just * to push for jupp\u00e9 instead of sarkozy ( i 'm planning on participating and vote for jupp\u00e9 , but not particularly out of hatred for sarkozy , jupp\u00e9 just happens to seem more qualified ) . 
  this latest national poll seems to show that whoever wins the republican primaries , wins the election ( but let 's not write off a big surprise - another terrorist attacks , jupp\u00e9 dies , a jupp\u00e9-le pen sex tape , macron 's popularity blows up , etc. 
  paywalled :( i found it on an archive , are archive links allowed ? 
  ( i think last time i posted one it was removed ), 
  stop at the first place there are police nearby and call 'em over , something like that . 
  thanks , that makes sense . 
  i expect someone will end up finding a technical solution , like an alarm that goes bwaaap bwaap if the cable is cut or something . 
  is it * that * hard to properly lock a truck ? 
  ( i 'm not a trucker , i do n't know , but surely the threat of a 2000-pound fine would be an incentive to find * some * way to securely lock your truck ... ), 
  she most likely wo n't be elected , tho i do n't know if this would increase or decrease her score . 
  it 's not as if she can point to nigel farage as an example to follow . 
  [ il est des notres ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vszfiyk5ei ) is probably the most common . 
  ( edit ) also [ la danse du limousin ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffmla9phe-e ) ( more of a drunk song than a drinking song tho ), 
  true . 
  * that * was actual satire . 
  seconded - i 'm in paris and was still making tasteless jokes after the charlie and bataclan attacks . 
  i just find laughing at disaster a better response than freaking out or getting all gloomy . 
  what happened happened , it 's not like we can do anything about it now . 
  so , to each his own coping mechanism . 
  the problem is people giving publicity to what they find outrageous and offensive . 
  if a joke makes you sad and angry , why do you have to go repeat it to a hundred people who will also get sad and angry ?? 
  that 's how you make everybody hate each other . 
  by comparison to this one , the first one is actually pretty good . 
  while they 're certainly very * different * , how often have you read an actual paper * charlie hebdo * ? 
  here you 're just being exposed to an extreme in terms of tasteless offensiveness , but it 's not representative as a whole . 
  if you showed the most tasteless unfunny edgy clip from south park to a regular charlie hebdo reader , he 'd conclude that charlie hebdo is just better quality . 
  i 'd say that in terms of finding new and creative ways to be offensive and still kinda funny , they 're equal , in terms of humour , south park is funnier , and in terms of intelligent commentary on contemporary issues , charlie hebdo is better . 
  `` cool , it keeps my tits from sagging ! '', 
  they realized they could make a living doing this , and have been doing so for decades . 
  i ca n't blame them for doing so , it sure beats working in an advertising firm . 
  eh , look at the various offensive charlie pics linked in this thread , many do n't have redeeming `` truths '' ... does [ this one ] ( http://blogs.lainformacion.com/zoomboomcrash/files/2015/01/charlie-hebdo-eta1.jpg ) have a `` point of truth '' to deliver ? 
   vuillemin eh , he 's pretty much the incarnation of crass and offensive and not-very-funny stuff . 
   charlie hebdo did a whole paper with jokes on surfers , and they received loads of angry letters in cavanna 's autobiography he talks about the hara-kiri days , about how they 'd always be getting mail from people who found the magazine hilarious , except that one time where they made fun of whichever group/profession the sender belonged to .

  stop stirring the drama . 
  what ? 
  no , it has nothing to do with nationalistic tendencies . 
  you do n't need to , does n't mean you ca n't , or that you should n't , or that anyone should n't . 
  before jumping to conclusions i 'd like to know if the official encrypted phone of our president was compromised . 
  it 's built by sagem and thales so that we control from the bare metal to the software stack what 's going on . 
  if that fails , then indeed our secret services are not doing their job . 
  but all in all we have a good track record of engineering and cryptography , we should be able to get by . 
  we just need to go to the bottom of this barrel . 
  of course no one is surprised , not even the french public ... 
  you could , in the same way you could give the correct answer to a mathematical problem without justification and have a shitty grade . 
  the teacher is there to evaluate your methodology . 
  doing so is actually harder for the student on shitty subjects like this one . 
  i mostly agree . 
  i think jupp\u00e9 and bayrou would be pretty good for us currently . 
  and i think that people are just overreacting to hollande . 
  he is not a bad president , by a long shot , and he has n't a bad team for his gov. 
  given that his popularity is abysmal anyway he also had the courage to push complicated reforms . 
  his successor will probably reap the fruit of it though . 
  and i think hollande will have done his job , without an explosive ego , without artifice , without panache , quietly . 
  and people hate him . 
  yes, 
  sure , not going to class because teachers were on strike ( sometimes because a colleague was attacked by a student , sometimes because a reform was going to worsen their working condition ) , not being able to take the bus or the train , or having mine delayed . 
  it 's been a fairly calm recently , striking-wise . 
  a day where 30 % of the teachers were on strike because they opposed the education reform a few weeks ago but that 's it . 
  valls is more popular than hollande but the left and the far left do n't really like him . 
  jupp\u00e9 is the challenger for the right against sarkozy . 
  he is more popular generally speaking but less so if you only ask ump activist . 
  a lot of things will change in the meantime . 
  hollande will soon go in full campaign mode and possibly attack valls popularity , a thing he has avoided for now as it was the easiest way to introduce the latest reforms . 
  but valls and jupp\u00e9 are pretty serious contender , while the two main figures are in a bad position . 
  the main problems i see are the economic paradigm they will support and the imbalance they would bring into fragile ecosystems . 
  fragile in the sense that very minute elements can have long lasting consequences , possibly quite subtle . 
  the least subtle is for example gmo modified to sustain ever growing amount of pesticides . 
  that 's great for pesticides vendors , not so great for other plants growing around , the soil , water and species relying on it . 
  i will not engage in argumenting against pesticides , there is a growing body of work about them . 
  bees are an important part of our ecosystem , and cancers are in a way , and as horrible as it sounds , externalized costs of a short term productivity improvement . 
  it has been shown that when we farm correctly ( permaculture ) , we can have superior efficiency than with industrial farming . 
  pesticides are thus a net cost to society ( cost of sanitization of water ressources for human consumption , cost of medicines to treat cancers , etc. . . ) , while the benefits will mostly go to pesticides producers ( and not farmers ! ) . 
  these gmos only serve to entrench these bad habits and will delay the adoption of the only possible long term solution . 
  we already have a very deep agricultural crisis in france for example , and industrial farming is at the heart of it . 
  in the end , the only way for these farmers to survive is to receive subsidies from the eu . 
  this is not sustainable farming , not in an ecological sense , not in an economic sense . 
  this is a social disaster . 
  anyway . 
  another problem with gmos is that they will specialize even further varieties of plants , while we need genetic diversity to counter parasites . 
  the greatest famines sometimes were due to only one variety being used ( ireland for example ) . 
  the automatic answer will then be `` but we can race nature at genetic engineering , create new varieties and all will be good '' . 
  i doubt that . 
  racing mother nature has a cost , cost that will be externalized on our societies ( see social disaster before ) . 
  the immediate gains from gmos are not so easy to count , and even without any risk , they might be only a way for a few multinational companies to further externalize their cost on public entities . 
  we should understand how nature work and take advantage of synergies already existing . 
  gmos might help there , but the capitalistic system is not well suited to a direct application on our ressources ( genetic diversity being one such resource ) . 
  it is simply not the right logic , the right system for it . 
  the goal of capitalism is to concentrate capital in the private property of a few owners . 
  this logic will push only a few strand , a few kind of plants in an effort to dominate the market . 
  monopolies are never good in nature . 
  well , not exactly without cause , but it 's pretty well known that while the nsa will gather economic intelligence , only a part of it will surface one way or another . 
  \\* adjust tinfoil hat \\* no seriously , i think that they are right to do so , however it 's high time that eu rise up to their level and use the same kind of tactics . 
  in the end it 's the consumer that should win something out of it . 
  however , we need further integration , cooperation , ~ ~ federalization ~ ~ * whoops , disregard that * ... 
  yes , but its application when it occured was a political jab at europe , for the same kind of thing the eu did to the usa , and so on . 
  the text might be ancient , its application is highly political . 
  that 's possible . 
  unfortunately , i think that the anti-gmo militants have been a disservice to the cause . 
  the roots of the green parties in europe are tied to radical activism , that was mostly justified in the 70-80-90 , but became more and more extreme as time went on and regulations improved ( however , i think that there are still fights that are relevant today that they try to address ) . 
  i think that it is perfectly possible to have a reasonable and cautious stance on the matter , without resorting to propaganda and misinformation , and still be against gmo in their current state . 
  documentaries and general information have been more akin to propaganda than anything . 
  reddit on the other hand is ** heavily ** biased toward gmos . 
  as a result , the echo chamber here will mostly feed on a straw man of the position of green parties , and will resort to cheap jab at these propagandist . 
  these activists being wrong does not mean that their stance is wrong in general . 
  not every anti-gmo or ecologist is against nuclear ( or as anti-nuclear as the green are ) , or that their ideas on gmos are extreme or unreasonable . 
  the precautionary principle is imo a very good regulatory principle , and i 'd be extremely disappointed if we became akin to the usa on the matter . 
  however , i think that things are not so black and white , and it 's perfectly possible that the federal government is forced by their constitution to be so laxist with regulations , so as to let each states decide for itself on how they want to regulate . 
  i hope . 
  that would mean however that their regulations are not compatible as is with the way the eu function , as much as industrial lobbyists would like to make bruxelles believe . 
  funny eh how some regulation is much easier to introduce when it 's about some foreign company ? 
  i think it is only the beginning . 
  we are starting to live in an era where everything is now becoming `` big data '' . 
  as empty as these buzzwords now are , it means that everything normal citizens do is monitored and archived somewhere by someone that will try to either make money off of it or gain power in one way or another . 
  the other face of this coin is that every administration , be it public or private , will also resort to this kind of easy-to-use tools . 
  in much the same way , every thing is more likely to be archived , the only thing needed is some spark , a whitleblower or some pressure , for it to be monitored . 
  this is a game changer , for now . 
  quickly the balance of power will come back to a status quo , those abusing it will start to understand how to avoid being caught ( or get caught and get removed from their position of abuse ) , those victims will still be left victim . 
  but in the meantime , some measure of chaos will happen , and we should see some interesting bits in the clear light . 
   i 'm sorry but you do n't understand how genetics work . 
  the crux of your debate was not at all about the * how * of the genetic manipulation . 
  this is not the problem with gmo , and never have been . 
  that something can be genetically modified is not inherently bad , but it allows an extraordinarily large and varied panel of modifications . 
  these possibilities are what must be under scrutiny . 
  the anti-gmo generally posit that they can not be thoroughly tested before being introduced in open air cultures . 
  their long term effects are much , much more difficult to assess than what we are currently able to foresee or simulate . 
  we are still extremely lacking on our understanding of ecosystems and interspecies synergy . 
  as for the anti-vaccination , i have no idea about the previous poster you responded to , but unfortunately it 's not entirely unreasonable to be wary of them . 
  i am fully aware of the stigma of the anti-vaxxers in the usa , and that 's not the point . 
  in 1994 , who issued a recommandation for universal vaccination of children against hepatitis-b . 
  at the end of 1995 , the first cases of [ multiple sclerosis ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/multiple_sclerosis ) appeared . 
  these cases continued to appear until 2001 . 
  the link between the two has been difficult to make and who condemned the position of our country on this matter , as ` scientifically unfounded ' . 
  still , some victims won some cases on it , and this vaccine is regarded as highly suspicious .

  it 's the same for my french-turkish friends - they 're all rooting for erdogan but their family only watch government-controlled info channels ( well , i 'm not sure if they are directly under their control but given what happens to those who criticize the government , they do n't even need to ) so every criticism is western propaganda , the coup was backed by the us and erdogan did nothing wrong / is the greatest human being ever . 
  you mean the one who was actually found guilty of corruption and was barred from holding public office for a decade when the party he led used public funds to pay employees who were actually working only for the party . 
  sure sounds like a great alternative !, 
  plus getting 100k after editing 3 articles as a stringer in a newspapers owned by one of her husband 's friends . 
  the scandal is poor timing for him but i think it 's excellent timing for us voters , it 's good to know that someone whose program is basically 100 % blood and tears for the working class ( cut benefits , cut public services and fire 600k public employees , make people work more for the same pay , etc ) because public finances are his # 1 priority does n't give a shit about spending our tax money on his wife for work she has n't done . 
  plus he kept talking shit about people living on minimum wages or people surviving on financial aid from the state as if they were parasites , and while there are people abusing the system , he 's a massive hypocrite for talking about it when he has done not only the same but with much bigger amount of money than any of them get . 
  and one they will need to negotiate with if they want to retain some of the benefits they have gained when they were a member . 
  even if israel welcomes jews who want to migrate there with open arms ( and annoyingly keeps inviting french jews to migrate there as if a war zone where the culture is nothing like the one they have been raised in for decades sounds like a great alternative to france ) , jews who frequented this synagogue are german citizens , right ? 
  you ca n't just burn down a church because you do n't approve the politics of italy or beat up a random jew who might or might not share the views of israel but just happens to have the same religion as the people who live there the same way you do n't boycott your local turkish kebab because you do n't approve of erdogan . 
  i dunno , obviously those examples are a bit ridiculous but i do n't see how you can target a local jewish community in germany and pretend you were protesting against a government thousands of kilometers away from there . 
  you do n't even need to get your ears pierced with clip-on and magnetic earrings so it 's not like you 'd be missing much . 
  i do n't know a single white-collar worker who only works 35h , working overtime is expected and i know a lot of people who are n't even paid for it ( especially when you 're a manager or an executive ), 
  he has tried to distance himself from this image recently though and his campaign is doing terrible because of it . 
  he had this image of being tough , caring about identity and security , not being afraid of angering socialist deputies who opposed him , even using the 49-3 to push laws through the parliament if his allies were n't cooperative enough . 
  some people hated him for it , some people liked it but those who hated him have n't forgotten how he acted under hollande and wo n't vote for him just because he pretends to have changed - those who liked him when he acted tough are probably disappointed by the way he acts now , not sure what he 's aiming for . 
  at least he 's not american because there 's not center nor anything that sounds remotely left-wing there ( maybe bernie sanders but he was ridiculed for it ) when you look at it from a french pov . 
  i suppose if there 's a messy divorce and one parent is fond of spanking their children , it can be used against him/her as to who should get custody or you could get in trouble if you do it in public and a witness calls the police on you . 
  it 's not the kind of law you can just decide to apply , spanking wo n't disappear overnight but if there 's a messy family and someone has witnessed spanking , it 's another law they can throw at the perp hoping something sticks during trial . 
  the goal is probably for spanking to slowly disappear over generations as people hide the fact that they 're doing it ( social stigma ? ), 
  or at least stop being proud of doing it . 
  were n't some parents actually sued for starving their baby to death when they tried to give him a vegan diet ( soy milk instead of milk plus apple juice ) ? 
  one could argue that calling it `` milk '' is misleading , even if it 's obviously not used to feed soy babies , it kinda implies that it is a viable alternative or a very similar product when it really does n't give you the same benefits as milk at all . 
  for an individual , killing as many people as possible and dying a martyr 's death is probably good enough , that 's a ticket straight to heaven for these weirdoes , right ? 
  for the organization behind them , any successful attack is a good pr move for recruiting new people , convincing others to do the same , reassuring their supporters that they are still holding strong against the western devils or some bullshit , plus we talk more about an attack on our soil than the ground they 're losing in syria . 
  and it increases tensions between communities here , even if politicians pretend that nothing has changed , probably * because * politicians like to pretend nothing has changed and people hate being told that when the opposite is obvious . 
  which makes the policies of the last decades even more ridiculous , all in the name of protecting minorities , we abandoned them in ghettoes where a minority of them ( radical muslims , gangs , drug dealers ) made their lives a living hell , made getting a job outside of ghettoes harder and will make them the prime target if there is a backlash against mass immigration , great job !, 
  one of the charlie hebdo attackers also lost his id while fleeing the police . 
  it 's stupid to carry an id if you 're robbing the place and hoping to live to see another day and enjoy the money you 've stolen but i suppose they want their name to be known or something , they 're actually proud of what they 're doing . 
  the saddest thing about it is that there are probably of lot of people living there who ca n't afford to move elsewhere ( these ghettoes are often full of social housing projects where people who ca n't afford a proper accomodation are sent ) and who would rather live in cities where women are treated better , where their kids have a better future , etc. 
  not saying they 're all innocent , the gangs controlling the areas , the people spreading their intolerant culture around are part of their group but they 're stuck with them and they see their children being influenced by them and embracing sometimes the very kind of culture they fled in their home country decades ago . 
  but the government has done little to protect them , all in the name of social peace , preventing unrest , allowing themselves to be easily re-elected , the fear of being seen as racists or intolerant if they acted tough on the minority amongst them who caused trouble . 
  and they have condemned the 90 % + of people who do n't cause trouble to a living hell all in the name of tolerance , they failed to protect minorities just so they would n't be seen as being too harsh on minorities . 
  every group or a vocal minority in every group ? 
  if they were n't complaining about this , they 'd be complaining about something else , there 'll never be a society without asshole trying to impose their vision of society on the others . 
  the funny part of this is that it 's sometimes the same vocal minority treating people with a different skin color like shit when they do their best to integrate or live an average life like any other without causing trouble and use those who do n't as proof that they all deserve to be deported because none of them tries to integrate . 
  we should be tougher on those who cause trouble , the state has done little to take care of the population stuck in gang-infested areas with no hope of their situation ever improving but there 's also much to do to help the majority of them when they face that kind of racist bullshit . 
  let 's be honest , even if she was born in metropolitan france , had been a french citizen from birth , with parents and greatparents who were also french citizens from birth , you 'd read the same racist comments , it 's all about her skin color . 
  guyana being far away from france is no excuse . 
  people do n't complain when white women whose parents or greatparents come from other european countries and win it . 
  most candidates are white women , which makes sense since france is mostly white but it 's not the first non-white woman to win ( sonia rolland , corinne coman ) and not the first non-white woman to rank high , it 's pretty neat - means that people who watch this show are more open-minded than some redditors out there . 
  you ca n't win though , this year people will complain about miss france not being white , last year minorities complained about miss france being centered around white women , that kind of shows brings the worst out of people when it 's nothing more than a family-friendly amateurish cabaret show , candidates seem to be having fun , people seem to enjoy watching it , who cares about results ? 
  the article does n't call them `` zombies `` in a derogative way or even says that it 's okay to use that word . 
  it explains a phenoma that was discussed and somewhat predicted in a controversial book a few years ago . 
   these men and women are , in the controversial term coined three years ago by the sociologists emmanuel todd and herv\u00e9 le bras , les zombies catholiques of france . 
  in their book le myst\u00e8re fran\u00e7ais , todd and le bras tried to explain why , in a country where barely five citizens in 100 attend church , the weight of catholicism is still evident . 
  they are n't called zombies because they follow the teachings of the church mindlessly or because they 're dumb , they 're called zombies because they somehow rise again and become so vocal on certain issues that you 'd think they make up half of the population when there 's only 5 % of people who actual go to the church on a weekly basis . 
  there are also way more conservative who agree with the church on certain issues than you 'd think if you only watched tv or listen to the radio , hence the surprise when they rise against it or passing a liberal law is somehow harder here than in the more religious uk or spain . 
  i 'd agree it 's not a good term though but i do n't think the article is insulting them . 
  thanks , guess we learn every day , 
  but , but ... 
  i want a moon base !, 
  plus they 've learned what kind of people the anti-establishment crowd was . 
  i 'm not saying people should put their trust in the establishment or those defending it but the brexit campaign was pretty weird : the outrageous lies on the negative effects of staying in the eu , the lies on the positive effects of brexit , the lies regarding how much eu citizens benefit from the uk versus how much uk citizens benefit from the eu , how the uk will still have to adhere to a lot of things to keep a lot of the benefits they want to keep , the total lack of a plan b on all sides when the results were announced , as if even the people who led the campaign to get out wanted no part in it , etc. 
  it 's like trump . 
  hillary 's campaign was a disaster and as much as democrats like to claim `` fool play '' when talking about wikileaks , the content of these emails does n't seem to be fake , the way they were working behind the scenes to pretty much hand her the throne no matter what was a huge turn-off . 
  but then you got trump elected and you look at him and you start listening to him going backwards on lot of promises ( especially the anti-establishment ones , he 's not exactly draining that swamp ) before he 's even president , it 's hardly reassuring . 
  and maybe you look at the shitshow in those countries and you think , maybe our establishment is terrible and the anti-establishment parties make the correct diagnostic when pointing this out but they do n't seem to be better , and the le pen drama between her and her father , her and her niece during the last few months makes them look like just like any other politician , people who care little about the country and way more about their own power / career / etc. 
  i think it 's even worse than that : only people who approve renzi as a leader and approve the reform will vote `` yes '' while people who might like renzi as a leader but oppose the reform will vote `` no '' , those who dislike renzi as a leader and do n't really want or care about the reform but not necessarily would have gone out of their way to vote `` no '' if he did n't put his resignation on the line will vote and obviously those who oppose both will vote `` no '' . 
  he pretty much doomed himself by putting his resignation on the line , there were a lot more reasons to vote `` no '' than `` yes '', 
   furthermore , the ps is in bad shape right now , nobody would want to associate with them as they will clearly lose the next elections i think they know the left ( whether it 's the ps or the far-left ) are going to lose the elections but i think their goal is to decide who 's going to be the main opposition to the next government past 2017 . 
  if the ps is crushed by m\u00e9lenchon then it 's pretty much over , is n't it ? 
  they ca n't keep throwing at us the same people we reject over and over again . 
  when in doubt about a referendum , just [ ask raffarin what you should do ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv3l2y7uwnq ), 
   the comment ( either true or not ) was made in a private setting and we do not know the context . 
  then he was mocking people but i mean , yes , she 's not the most honest person there is but remember that he denied having ever said it before acknowledging it in his own book , which means he was n't really being honest either . 
  then he pretended that while he did call them toothless , he was n't mocking them but when she released the full text , he did n't even try to deny it , which makes him look even less trustworthy . 
  [ here 's a source ] ( https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/french-probe-on-defense-secret-after-president-met-reporters/2016/11/21/300888da-b01c-11e6-bc2d-19b3d759cfe7_story.html ) if anyone wants to learn more about it , the book was a disaster . 
  he even lost what was left of his voterbase to the left by stating that france had a problem with islam and that there was too much unwanted immigration ( even though he often publicly tried to convince people it was n't ) but no matter whether you agree with him or not ( i think he 's right though you can endlessly debate who 's responsible and what would be the solutions to these issues ) , the fact that he spent that much time with journalists and barely talked to some of his ministers probably did more damage , it looked like his legacy mattered more to him than his job as president ... or his country . 
  i think it was in a text he sent his wife at the time ( the one who wrote a book where she spilled the beans on him when she learned he was cheating on her ) , he denied it for a longtime despite her having screenshots of the conversation but i think he acknowledged it in his own book a few weeks ago ( the one where he pretty much destroyed his own reputation by letting 2 journalists spend more time with him than members of his government , letting them see top secret documents they were n't cleared to see like a potential syria invasion plan to overthrow assad amongst other ... sensitive information ), 
  called them `` toothless '' because when he visited poor areas , he saw plenty of people with missing teeth or crappy ones ( yeah , people who ca n't afford to fix it really enjoyed some rich asshole laughing at them ) . 
  punishing our current government by turning against them and pushing them to the bottom of polls once they 're in power is as close as we can get to our old guillotine-days . 
  tbh , with the sheer amount of people dissecting your every moves on social media and the media talking politics all day long , i do n't think we 'll ever have a popular politician ever again , no matter what you say , there 'll always be people explaining why you 're wrong before you finish your sentence . 
  i do n't think they 're that different from us , we change our minds and make mistakes all the time but others are too busy covering theirs to really care about ours while politicians are too much under the spotlight . 
   some people were afraid that hollande was going to skip it and declare himself candidate for the ps , but now we know it 's not going to happen . 
  unlikely , primaries have been announced a long time ago , if hollande decided to cancel them and make himself the official socialist candidate without going through primaries , it would be proof that he knew he was going to lose there and if he ca n't win * that * , how does he expect to do better in the actual elections ? 
  losing during the primaries , cancelling the primaries or being crushed in the presidential elections was going to be a huge humiliation ( plus it would have been awkward for the last 4 months of his term , if you 've been crushed in your own primaries , how can you represent the country ? 
  ) , might as well move on to something else entirely . 
  sure , some people will laugh at him but at least he took the hint , not like sarkozy who thought of himself as some sort of messiah the people wanted to put back on the throne as if his 5 years as president did n't disappoint the vast majority of us . 
  they already went for it , mohammed merah killed 3 jewish kids in 2012 and the group behind the bataclan/restaurants attacks last year was actually planning to attack a kindergarten near paris . 
  police only stopped them because one of their relatives called the police on them . 
  the key words here are `` how to '' , 
  yeah people have a difficult time with sex , gender & sexual orientation . 
  in today 's society , lucklily most people have all these things aligned in the expected way ( eg . 
  biologically female , considers herself a woman , is attracted to people of the opposite sex ) so they are easily accepted by the majority but those things are hardly a choice . 
  it should n't be that hard to imagine that if you were born and developped a certain way ( nature + nurture ) then there are people who were born and developped another way . 
  i mean , yeah gender is a bit of a clusterfuck if you really study it deep but which part of the human mind is n't ? 
  we had the same problem in france when the government tried to have some classes regarding gender equality . 
  nothing too exciting really , stuff like : is this something girls / boys do ? 
  do you think girls / boys ca n't do it ? 
  do you know that there are women in this male-dominated field and men who work in women-dominated fields ? 
  ... common sense really , like there are a lot of men in fashion , you can be a man and you can like dancing , you can be a girl and want to be a mechanic , it did n't tell you what to do , it just told you that you should n't think some things are impossible because of your gender . 
  and then there were people protesting against these classes because kids would be taught they could switch gender at will , that there was no boy nor girl , some fake news even pretended that kids would be taught how to masturbate . 
  it was nowhere in the program ( tbh if it was , i 'd be worried about the sanity of our politicians ) and the education minister had to refute it every week for months and there are still people who refuse to believe there 's no conspiration to turn their children into genderless demons . 
  he probably thinks he could save money by investing in the new-remain campaign since a brexit would cost him more in the long-term , not sure he ever cared about the future of the uk or any of its inhabitants . 
  funny thing is that if jupp\u00e9 did indeed get a lot of votes from left voters who wanted to prevent sarkozy from reaching the second turn of the primaries , with fillon that close to 50 % ... it 's not unlikely that they actually prevented fillon from winning the primaries during the first round . 
  there was no need to lie their way into that primary ( since you have to sign a document where you swear that you share their values ), 
  well , if you repeat it enough times and there 's no dissenting voice calling you out on your bullshit , i 'm sure it can work . 
  takes a few years but works , at least works enough for a tabloid like the sun to stay afloat for way longer than it should have . 
  said only reason he was n't pushing for more is that it 's the maximum number of hours authorized by the eu . 
  tbh , many people work more than 35h , especially white-collar workers but there has to be some sort of compensation for it ( increased pay , more rest or a salary so high people can earn a lot before they burn out and move on to an easier job ) .

  * also in 1806 , the father of alexandre dumas became g\u00e9n\u00e9ral and was half black . 
  * being a jazz fan , i read that france is the second homeland of jazz , partly because many us black jazz musicians came to france to be treated as human beings and not as blacks . 
  sure , there are racism problems in france , but in the past , france was pretty much better in this respect than any other country . 
  edit : ~ ~ 1906 ~ ~ 1806, 
  the least likely one : dupont-aignan !, 
  the strip club thing is not surprising . 
  there are very few strip clubs in france . 
  it 's not a common thing at all . 
  agreed . 
  never send images of your dick to young children . 
  you could get into trouble !, 
   but to get this money party need to have as many female candidate as male candidate . 
  this is to encourage more women into politics . 
  recently a political party had a little bit more women than men ( as candidates ) and was denied public money . 
  yes , it 's a completely stupid system !, 
  * 2 of the most famous `` french '' people are in fact polish ( marie curie , chopin ) ; * very catholic * many immigrants came to france a long time ago to work in mines ( especially north east of france ) * they love unconditionally the last few letters of the alphabet * they need to progress before reaching the level of social coolness of the west ( regarding gays , racism , ... ) * they have bisons !, 
  not that much : http://www.nationmaster.com/graph/lab_str-labor-strikes the difference with other countries is that the transports ( air france , sncf ( rails ) , m\u00e9tro , bus , ... ) are often on strike . 
  this impacts everyone including some of the 90m visitors we get each year . 
  a polish guy goes to see the optician . 
  the optician asks him if he can read the first line ( in large characters ) on the board : `` x k z y w ... '' . 
  `` read it ? '', 
  answers the polish man , `` i even know this guy !, 
  the french have the lowest results for the latter question because the question is ambiguous . 
  in france , the president and the parliament are directly elected in the sense that you directly vote for one person . 
  the eu elections are some kind of proportional list thing , so you do not directly vote for one person . 
  i think that that 's the reason for the low result from france . 
  dailymotion is french . 
  that 's the only service i can name that i use and is not american . 
  it 's really sad . 
  sorry man , but a large part of the paris surroundings are very steep hills . 
  it does not make much sense to bike to work everyday for most people in those conditions . 
  so about 60 % of people had a religious upbringing and about 86 % are atheists/agnostics . 
  this is strikingly european . 
  no other part of the world would have such numbers . 
  in the last 2 generations , religion has become relevant to a tiny minority of people ( in the age group of / r/europe ), 
  i think a question about ** behaviour ** will tend to be ambiguous . 
  if you ask a question about homosexual behaviour , i am not too sure what to answer . 
  for instance i would not bring my very young kids to a gay pride because it 's overtly sexual . 
  so i would probably not know what to answer about heterosexual behaviour either . 
  well , there is a language issue too . 
  the people that go to an english speaking site from a non-english speaking country tend to be expatriates . 
  sounds exactly like what i heard in france too . 
  not a specialist , but if the animal is suffering or is highly stressed , several types of chemicals will be produced by the body . 
  you really want to avoid them , not that they are dangerous , but they might alter the taste , colour , ... 
  do n't laugh at others , we have done the [ same ] ( http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/christine_boutin#ministre_du_logement_et_de_la_ville ) !, 
  since this is r/europe , the question is : was it unique to france ? 
  in france some elected positions can be accumulated , most obvious one is mayor and mp . 
  does this happen elsewhere ? 
  your estates are our `` breaks '' in french . 
  i think it comes from the english hunting breaks . 
  do not forget other critical factors : * women can work and have kids . 
  nobody is going to think they are bad mothers , like in germany * pre-school ( maternelles in french ) , schools and after school activities keep children late , until their parents can pick them up after work . 
  * completely free mother/child weekly meetings in every town and villages for under 3 year old kids ; complete with doctors , nurses , psychologists , education specialists and so on ... those are just incredible . 
  that 's what i basically told him . 
  son , in 14 years time , you 'll be happy if that still happens . 
  i can believe that . 
  i have a similar experience with my 4 year old son . 
  apparently he 's like an ideal french boy for the japanese . 
  each time we go to paris ( i live just outside ) and we come close to japanese tourists , they stop us and take photos of my son . 
  the weirdest time was when a bunch of japanese schoolgirls in uniform started screaming when they saw him . 
  my son is now scared of japanese . 
  sorry for the late reply . 
  i am pissed off by the french government spying on me . 
  i 'd be even more pissed off if the french government massively spied on non-french people . 
  but , you know what : i can do something about it . 
  i can vote , lobby , etc. . . to have this changed . 
  i can not do anything about a foreign government spying on me . 
  lastly , it is also a matter of scale . 
  the means the french services have to spy on people are ridiculously small relative to what the nsa et al. 
  have got . 
  that 's not completely true . 
  us ** mass ** tourism started in the 80 's and , yes , they were `` doing '' europe in on week . 
  this has changed a lot now and americans are much better tourists than they use to be . 
  the same for japanese . 
  the chinese are just starting and they behave like idiot tourists . 
  this will also change in 10 or so years . 
  i heard an expert recently that said that for every espionage act committed by french services , the uk equivalent did 5 and the us 100 . 
  obviously , everyone in this area knew this . 
  the two big differences are : - if you are not in france , you will most probably not be spied on by the french services , whereas the usa agencies listen to everyone via google , ... - the french services have not yet been proven to spy on the us congress , for instance . 
  fine , but where are the european apple , google , amazon ? 
  let 's play this game , name an international european website !, 
  outside of dailymotion , i can not name one . 
  those people are not relevant what so ever . 
  far left , far right and the greens . 
  only the greens are participating in the government and they are rather small . 
  mayonnaise with one n !, 
  dutch speakers should be indicted for crimes against french language , or even linguistic crime , in the linguistic court of paris . 
  kado ( what are you ? 
  6 year olds ? ), 
  cadeautje ( please , kill me now ! ), 
  horloge ( it means clock , damn it , not watch ) and so many other crimes . 
  it 's at least as bad as yanks thinking that entr\u00e9es means main course !, 
   a 17-year-old girl singing about sucking a `` lollipop '' this is exactly what [ france gall ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pxt_r7jlka ) was singing when she was 17 in france and in 1966 . 
  song by gainsbourg so full of innuendos !, 
  right , you do not understand how some of the french unions , especially in the transport area . 
  they basically strike `` to put pressure on the government '' ( as they say ) . 
  then the government gives in ( well before negotiations even start ) , and they stop striking . 
  it means that they can ask for anything they want and get it . 
  it 's very different to the `` normal '' way unions and managements/governments are suppose to work . 
  it 's a scam .

  the issue was breach of contract . 
  sorry , it quite literally was . 
  the term breached was one against rising labour costs . 
   then say that . 
  or do n't , because your yourself quoted the commission 's commitment to terms that would require the us to respect those conventions . 
  um ... pretty much what i said . 
  the usa has n't ratified core ilo conventions . 
   the miracle of compromise , where you agree to certain terms that you did n't before , because they 're part of a deal that 's beneficial overall ? 
  leaks have shown the usa is n't interested in compromise . 
  also , i repeat myself : it would take a negotiating miracle for the usa to suddenly approve of principles it has n't ratified for decades . 
  that 's never going to happen , and you know it . 
   i live in the real world , where the us has better rights in terms of overtime pay than europe does . 
  just because it goes against your ` evil capitalist americans ruin everything ' narrative does n't mean that it 's untrue . 
  til worker 's rights = overtime pay , and overtime pay only . 
   you obviously know better than the european commission , and we should all listen to you instead of them , yes . 
  what a strange comment . 
  so we have to blindly accept any government official 's word as it is and not say anything against it , because obviously they know more than we do ? 
   no it did n't , and it 's either ignorant or dishonest to claim that it did . 
  egypt got into a suit because it violated the terms of an established contract that it was a party of . 
  those terms were allegedly violated , according to veolia , because of egypt 's minimum wage . 
  interesting that you did n't have anything to say on the new zealand / australia one . 
  there are many other examples , like vattenfall suing germany because of new environmental regulations and the like . 
   you know the us is not only part of the ilo , but sits on its governing body , right ? 
  you know that the usa has only ratified 2 out of 8 core ilo conventions , right ? 
  and the ones the usa did ratify are the ones against forced labour and on the `` worst forms of child labour '' . 
  it has n't ratified the rest . 
  so the usa would suddenly accept core principles it has not ratified before ? 
  by what miracle ? 
   the us already has better rights in terms of overtime pay than europe does , but let 's not let facts get in the way of a good , smug america-bashing . 
  i 'm sorry , but in what world do you live in where the usa has more worker 's rights than europe ? 
  so we 'll be able to block us products thanks to our higher standards , but european products will be able to flood us markets ? 
  do you honestly believe that ? 
  that document is hilarious . 
  it actually wants us to think that us products will be stopped by eu regulations while the eu will have a free run on the us market . 
  yeah right , like the usa would ever do something like that . 
  the part about isds is just blatant lying . 
  isds is one of the worst infringements on democracy and sovereignty . 
  i used this example before , but new zealand basically halted their tobacco laws because of an isds suit between australia and philip morris . 
  egypt got into a suit because it raised its minimum wage . 
  this is fucking pandora 's box . 
   for example , we want ttip to include commitments that guarantee that both the us and the eu respect core labour standards set out in core conventions of the international labour organisation ( ilo ) oh , you mean all those conventions the usa has not signed ? 
  to the usa , something as innocuous as the european social charter is basically communism . 
  they 'll ** never ** move an inch towards european-style worker 's rights . 
  did n't he also receive death threats because of his stance on same-sex marriage ? 
  so you 're expecting us to believe that this free trade agreement actually wo n't have any free trade in it ? 
  the fact that the precautionary principle does n't appear at any point should be a big red flag . 
  the leaks show that they 're definitely not budging from that position , while the eu has been desperately trying to compromise . 
  fears about the precautionary principle are therefore justified . 
  um , cause that 's what the usa wants for europe as well ? 
  til germans have feelings . 
  constantinople is a direct continuation of the roman empire . 
  russia ... not so much . 
  ca n't really think of any big negative in marx 's influence on those fields , quite the contrary . 
  subutai should really be recognised as one of the greatest commanders in history . 
  destroying the polish and hungarian armies in a few days in a coordinated attack with troops deployed 500 km apart is no mean feat !, 
  you mean , the roman empire , ca . 
  the point of separate gender studies is that sociology/history being the study of past and present human societies , they have a general trend of overlooking women . 
  thus , a specific area of study around women . 
  well , they did try to help . 
  in 468 , the eastern roman empire sent everything it had to reconquer roman africa , under basiliscus , a gigantic fleet with about 70 000 men and a thousand ships . 
  except they got routed by the vandal fleet at the battle of cape bon . 
  i happen to think women are n't food or animals , but maybe that 's just me being brainwashed by teh gender studies . 
  i do n't defend the capital `` grimly '' . 
  but anyways . 
  yeah , my mistake , it was n't about the french revolution ( there 's a similar passage about it , which is why i made that mistake ) . 
  looking into it , it comes from a polemic engels wrote against the `` anti-authoritarians '' , e.g. 
  the people who followed bakunin and the anarchists in the first international . 
  engels basically is arguing that they 're deluded if they think all authority will immediately disappear during a revolution . 
  engels is saying this is unrealistic , since revolutions are violent - as evidenced by absolutely all the revolutions in their time , and before their time . 
  also , you conveniently forgot to post what he says right before that :  why do the anti-authoritarians not confine themselves to crying out against political authority , the state ? 
  all socialists are agreed that the political state , and with it political authority , will disappear as a result of the coming social revolution , that is , that public functions will lose their political character and will be transformed into the simple administrative functions of watching over the true interests of society . 
  but the anti-authoritarians demand that the political state be abolished at one stroke , even before the social conditions that gave birth to it have been destroyed . 
  they demand that the first act of the social revolution shall be the abolition of authority . 
  the fact that a revolution is not going to be civilised is hardly anything marx or engels invented . 
  it 's a theoretical framework for historical analysis . 
  the study of history does n't have one set of absolute , `` true '' , proven frameworks - social history is as valid as economic history , cultural history , political history , etc. 
  really , the only 100 % discredited frameworks for studying history are `` great man theory '' and believing history is nothing but the will of god/gods . 
  yeah , he - engels , not marx , by the way - is talking about the french revolution . 
  revolutions are nearly always violent affairs , and they certainly were in that time . 
  it 's fine if you do n't want to have any sort of race-mixing . 
  it 's a bit problematic if you want to stop * others * from doing it . 
  eh , because i think the study of how we have attributed certain characteristics to either gender and how that changes through time , and through cultures , is interesting . 
  for example , how the colour pink slowly became a feminine colour despite being a very masculine colour until the 20th century ( and how blue did the exact inverse ) . 
  or how the idea of `` maternal instinct '' started to be generalised . 
  that sort of stuff . 
  oh , i 'm assuming you 're only talking about commodity fetishism . 
  except commodity fetishism and its criticism does n't mean `` maaan , we really should n't be so attached to our worldly posessions '' . 
  at all . 
  ah , well , we definitely agree in the end then . 
  as defined by marx , class struggle can not be avoided so long as there are classes . 
  and there has n't been a classless society ( in fact , even what we call `` primitive societies '' have some form of social distinction ) and there most probably wo n't be one ( barring fully automated luxury gay space communism obviously  . 
  right , so who was the guy who wrote about them before marx ? 
  not being a `` classic liberal universalist '' is one thing , screeching against `` race-mixing '' is another . 
   before i continue let me say this . 
  how about you stop trying to paint my views using words like `` naive '' and instead attack me on substance ? 
  that will make it easier for both of us . 
   now on to substance . 
  yes there is conflict in the us or australia . 
  it was addressed differently though . 
  not via marxist mean but through progressivism .

  if you 're in a relationship and tell your partner `` we need to talk '' and they shut you down instead of sitting and speaking , you have nothing to do in a relationship with them . 
  he does n't want to blackmail , that 's misrepresentation to make him look bad . 
  he just wants to open a discussion about several topics that need change in the eu . 
  if other countries do n't even want to talk , yeah , he 's ready to leave because we do n't have to tolerate the disrespect . 
  but other countries are sensible so we 'll talk about what we could change in the eu , and m\u00e9lenchon will submit to referendum whatever change the eu can agree on . 
  if it 's enough for french people , we stay , if its not , we leave , but it 's french people that will decide , not m\u00e9lenchon alone in his office . 
  i translated his program about that and will post it tomorrow at a more affluent time . 
  only if you still want to embarrass yourself . 
  no , up till now the standard stance on cannabis has been harsh repression . 
  only recently has it started to change . 
  at least it would clarify things . 
  who do we blame for our problems , bankers or migrants ? 
  the only thing they have in common is being against the eu status quo , and even then they have totally different goals and strategies for what to do . 
  almost everyone , but it 's not as easy to do depending on who you are . 
  m\u00e9lenchon called her a fascist , got sued , won on the ground not that the court assessed her as a fascist , but that being permitted to call her that was par for the course for a healthy democratic debate . 
  journalists could be more incisive , but they probably fear being sued too and are probably less protected than other politicians . 
  i 'm sure they 'd find plenty of historians of politics to support the idea if in a nuanced fashion . 
  the state of journalism being atrocious to complicit in france , they are unsurprisingly tame in their critics . 
  what truly bothers me is everyday folks on internet forums . 
  we should be able to name things as they are . 
  call cats cats . 
  yet as demonstrated by jooana , there 's always someone to shield fascists from being called what they are . 
  they 're rarely called out on it too . 
  just a few days ago on a thread about migrants , a few commenters suggested we `` round them up and put them into camps '' , their words . 
  so i obviously pointed out the closeness to nazism , and it 's me who got immediately called out with the same kind of rhetoric as jooana , `` if you call people you disagree with nazis the word loses it 's meaning and real nazis roam free '' , `` there you go calling everyone you disagree with nazis '' , etc ... like , if we ca n't call people who want to `` round up and put into camps '' people they have prejudice against , who can we call nazis ? 
  and it 's from the bottom up these people get legitimized . 
  by everyday folks refusing to name names among themselves and shame horrible ideas into the shadows . 
  it 's by refusing to do that and being afraid to offend them that they have so much exposure . 
  it 's right-wing political correctness . 
  you know what , you 're right . 
  it extremizes the labels by refusing to use them on anyone and desensitizes the ideas they do convey and that are represented by real people and politicians . 
  it 's what allows people such as le pen to appear respectable , because we refuse to label them by pushing the definitions further . 
  while the systems are indeed different and le pen will have a harder time being elected ( though i do n't discount it ) , calling france 's election system functional is not understanding it well . 
  what desensitizes political labels such as fascist or nazi is refusing calling people that by being overly cautious , by fear of being rude to them . 
  the risk is avoiding calling fascists fascists . 
  it allows them to blend in and be put in charge , and then when the fascism comes everyone acts surprised and wonder how we let it happen and how we did n't see it coming . 
  that 's the problem with macron , he does n't have a communication team , he has a marketing team . 
  everything he says is designed to be at the same time positive and appealing to most while absolutely devoid of any substance . 
  in light dose , it catches the eye . 
  in concentrated amounts , it 's an absolute turn-off .

  i 'd so love for him to get angry and humiliate laurent ruquier for mocking him to his face . 
  this is such a prevalent sentiment . 
  cynicism that makes people say , often through their own experiences either on the giving or receiving hand that you ca n't win without cheating . 
  one of the biggest poison of our democracies . 
  she needs mps for a group and be an opposition party . 
  maybe she 'll get the 15 needed , but that 's not even a given , and a 15 people group wo n't have much weight at all . 
  maybe if you finish high school after that you 'll learn the far-right loves to appropriate left-wing vocabulary to appeal to the working class without meaning any word of it . 
  i said fair trade , not free trade . 
  free trade is indeed right wing and i personally do n't like that . 
  but it seems you have difficulty both writing and reading , so i 'll leave you there and you can hit me up when you 've finished primary school . 
  and so like i was telling you , protectionism can be internationalist and left-wing if the optics is fair trade and the betterment of each others countries , or nationalistic , isolationist and right-wing if the optics is racism and resentment and appeal to patriotism . 
  protectionism is a tool use in different ways by different people . 
   but left wing on his protectionist stuff . 
   protectionism is definitively right wing pick one ? 
  i 'm sure you have your definitions rights , it 's your perception or reality that is wrong . 
  protectionism \u2260 left-wing . 
  it can be if inter-nationalist , but trump 's protectionism is nationalist and isolationist , so right-wing . 
  allende ? 
  as in salvador allende ? 
  what kind of parallel universe are you living on ? 
  you must be talking about augusto pinochet , his usa-backed dictatorial successor . 
  ecology is n't `` the most important thing '' in his program , it 's not just another part that 's weighted against the others , it 's the backbone that justifies and allows for the overall vision . 
  ok , dealing with either a troll or an imbecile , have a sweet night . 
  what ? 
  not at all . 
  countries and their frontiers represent cultures , traditions , languages , and thus behavioral tendencies that can differ significantly from their neighbor in a way people inside random geographic zones do n't . 
  that 's like saying you ca n't draw tendencies on people depending on if they live in rich or poor neighborhood , or in the city or in the countryside , or near the sea or near mountains . 
  of course the spacial structures where people live influence them just like biological or social structures . 
  how is making broad strokes by countries any worse than by gender , age , class , etc ... ? 
  oh if le pen wins , i definitely agree , i 'm just portraying how her side views things . 
  what 's polarizing is the idea that there exists such a thing as `` pragmatic solutions that go beyond the traditional left/right ideological divide '' . 
  to some people , to you it seems , it 's common sense , while to some other it 's code-speech for `` liberalism disguised as common sense '' . 
  le pen is also very economically liberal even if she does a good job at concealing it . 
  she is n't class divisive , she 's racially divisive , uniting racist of all class that want kick blacks and arabs out . 
  she comes of as both snobbish and childish , or in other words `` she knows what she 's talking about and does n't take shit from anyone '' and `` she knows how to let go and is popular ( as in close to the people ) '' . 
  media-wise she 's a strange thing , as her person and party is portrayed as an danger , yet she and her party have been normalized and her ideas are depicted anything from dangerous to acceptable to common sense depending on the topic . 
  the other candidates are n't all very liberal and/or class divisive and/or very favorably portrayed by medias either . 
  i guess i just have better imagination . 
  le pen is economically a national-liberal-capitalist and her program reflects that . 
  very economically liberal policies . 
  very class divisive in they way he holds himself and in the content of his speeches . 
  intensely portrayed as a golden boy savior by medias and people hate to be told what to think . 
  people notice these things . 
  oh i do agree that le pen removing france from the eu means the end of the eu and great instability . 
  from her supporter perspective it 's for the better , and i disagree with that , because her exit would be a nationalist and isolationist one . 
  i do think eu-as-we-know-it proponents overestimate the impact of a request for radical change or even of an inter-nationalist exit would be . 
  i understand that they 're afraid , especially eastern europeans , but i think they should n't be . 
  where le pen 's exit is an exit that says `` we can do better on our own '' , left-wing exit ( which would be last resort ) says `` we can forge better and stronger links with everyone without the eu bringing us down '' . 
  i honestly believe a france outside the eu and its bickering ( though i do hope we stay to change it ) and outside nato ( and i do wish we quit it ) would have a better shot at helping stabilize eastern europe with its gained independence than it has today . 
  i do think france and other eu countries being at each others throat in internal politics and under us command in nato prevents us from having an effective eastern europe and anti-putin policy . 
  probably referring to the fact that fillon is openly and proudly a christian conservative on social values , and that he wants the law to reflect those values . 
  stuff against gay rights or reproductive rights mainly . 
  mixing religion and politics so openly is n't well received in france . 
  we voted 55/45 against the eu constitution/lisbon treaty in 2005 , and this division exists to this day . 
  on one side , the eu is something sacred that you ca n't touch , lest you provoke war in europe , pretty much the attitude of this sub so you know i 'm not making this up . 
  on the other side , people are fed up with this hyperbole and emotional blackmail . 
  whether a nationalist brexit-style exit or a left-wing `` tabula rasa '' radical change , people are ready to change the status quo , knowing it would be hard times but for the better in the long run , both for france and the eu .

  but why is that a euro problem ? 
  are you equating some european banks = euro ? 
   they do contribute greatly to the success of the dna . 
  even a broken clock is right twice a day . 
   so you admit that he did n't merely `` stuck '' in moscow when his passport expire ? 
  i 'm sure that if another country grants him asylum , he 'll accept it . 
  he said so himself . 
  so he didnt specifically choose russia because he 's bff with putin and wanted to give him some info . 
   non-sensical i am calling your `` kremlin based mob '' comments non-sensical . 
  he didnt take that data and give it to putin . 
  show me some articles saying that he gave stuff to putin or the fsb specifically . 
  sri is more like the cia and the rightful heir to the securitate legacy . 
   good job technically yes . 
  but it 's like saying the stasi did a good job . 
  or the nsa . 
  so that 's why you vote for cameron !, 
  he simply has no vision or plans and goes whatever issue is popular . 
   english-speaking russian bots lel . 
   today , wikileaks changed their narrative to admit that they advised snowden to go to russia where he would be `` safe '' okay , so you admit snowden 's first plan was n't to go to russia , making your first comment  has stolen gigabytes of classified documents and brought them to putin non-sensical . 
   he is a criminal what is his sentencing then ? 
   during the height of the sovereign debt crisis the fed recapitalized eurozone financial institutions no . 
  as the link reads : the fed and the ecb borrowed money to some european banks . 
  here 's the main line in that article  the ecb said sept. 15 it will coordinate with the fed and other central banks to provide three-month dollar loans to banks to ensure they have enough of the currency through the end of the year . 
   without these loans there is little doubt there would have been at least some defaults , likely major defaults within the eurozone financial sector . 
  you mean dexia would have defaulted . 
  darn what a missed opportunity there . 
   eurozone financial sector uhm , in your article :  dexia sa , based in brussels and paris , was the biggest euro-area borrower , with as much as $ 58.5 billion of fed loans on dec. 31 , 2008 . 
  bnp paribas sa in paris borrowed as much as $ 29.3 billion on april 18 , 2008 . 
  the largest u.s. borrower , new york-based morgan stanley , took $ 107.3 billion of loans on sept. 29 , 2008 . 
  us banks were in much deeper shit ... 
  oh god the circle jerk :d  kremlin-inspired snowden mob . 
  your anti-russia boner is voiding your brain of blood . 
  i see ukraine is really pushing for some us money . 
   brought them to putin he was stuck in moscow when the us suspended his passport . 
  he didnt plan to stay in russia . 
  nowadays the gay district in paris , le marais gets more and more gentrified . 
   then shortly after leaving it experienced a long period of growth , see figure 2 or we can look at the gdp per capita compared in france , uk and germany  https://www.google.fr/search?q=france+gdp&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;gws_rd=cr&amp;ei=kck6vtbbickmu8k3v7gp honestly , there 's no obvious trend . 
  they all seem really close together , the curbs . 
  what i am saying that a monetary union has to lead to a fiscal union . 
   because we had already experienced the problems of monetary union yes , a poor economy . 
  and the us doesnt have an official language . 
   but a currency shared with much richer regions strongly exacerbates the issue . 
  in the eurozone example german manufacturing strongly benefits from the weakened currency gives them . 
  greek agriculture ? 
  not so much . 
  hence fiscal union . 
   i know you were n't making a serious suggestion but there is some wisdom behind your words !, 
   i know there are arguments for it . 
  but it 's like people just discovered that single currencies have their pitfalls too . 
  alabama will forever be poor unless they discover gold or oil . 
  b\u00e9ziers , i didnt count it because hey what do you expect ? 
  but the france 2 report was about evry . 
   you realize france is probably , by far the most racist country in europe , right ? 
  i 'm not fully sure about that . 
  while france did and does have issues : you got ta admit during ww2 , romania was super eager to kill some jews . 
  heck go visit iasi and tell me how many memorials to the pogroms there are ? 
  one ? 
  unveiled in 2011 . 
  and what was that pogrom ? 
  13k jewish killed in 1 day . 
  and just one memorial unveiled a whopping 22 years after communism fell . 
  and the whole iron guard ? 
  the people loved that shit , with it 's orthodox stance . 
  and how many romanians dont say : darn more gypsies should have been sent to bug . 
  dont tell me you have never heard that saying . 
   not so strict and uptight here . 
  not being a jerk at your job means you 're uptight and strict ? 
  interesting . 
  i 'll ask some polish friends :d, 
   this will certainly be a consideration for policy makers . 
  like the lisbon treaty ? 
   how many countries in the eu would protect snowden in their borders ? 
  there 's a difference between protecting snowden and accusing him of being a ** criminal ** . 
  last time i 've checked snowden didnt face any trial so no you can not call him a criminal . 
   call the pm a puppet or someone who 's in touch with reality . . his eagerness to accuse people left and right makes him a puppet . 
   i want belgium , or at the very least flanders flemish confirmed . 
  i think nobody cares except some mayors here and there ( evry ) . 
  or maybe it was a bs news story from france 2 that i 've seen a few days ago . 
  they only interviewed the kebab owner and just quickly passed over what the mayor said . 
   we need to work out what sarko 's policy is too . 
   we also need to work out if a referendum is required by french law etc. 
  like that ever stopped policy makers . 
  are n't you naive . 
   dutch euscepticism is very high . 
  well it will be an anti- `` going dutch '' policy but so be it . 
  who said you 'd have to wait ? 
   when the german and french voters find out that a fiscal union means more taxes going to other countries , they will start to change their minds . 
  i ca n't see this passing a referendum in france . 
  are we talking about policies or are we speculating about referendums ? 
   for the same reason westerners call us thieves . 
  generalisation and when a westerner calls you a thief , do you go : yes sir you are very right . 
  i shall change my behaviour to suit whatever needs you have of me in order to confirm to you that i am not a thief . 
  or do you go : fuck you , you xenophobic cunt ? 
  also look at this comment :  https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3rh28b/opinion_is_eastern_europe_really_more_racist_than/cwo3not gypsies have been living in romania before even the concept of romania existed . 
  heck 500 + years . 
  yet they still dont share the same culture . 
  it 's the principle of it . 
  a single guy can decide what policy your govt implements : because of the magic of `` markets '' . 
  and what works for the uk might not work for france or germany . 
  each has to find their own way .

  when you try and help someone repeatedly and he always end up slapping your face in return , you will end up resenting this person and no longer be willing to help him . 
  that 's why they are hated , because yeah they are miserable but they do n't want our help , they just want to continue stealing . 
  a few years back , a few mayors in france started giving decent appartments to them so they would have somewhere nice to live . 
  all these initiatives ended up only one way : the roma stripped the appartments bare of everything , including taking the water pipings and electricity cabling , destroying walls in the process . 
  they then left the now unlivable appartments and disappeared in the nature to sell the pipings and cablings as scrap metal . 
  the worst is they knew that these now unlivable appartments would not be able to be used to lodge poor people for a while , forcing some people that could have used them to live in the street instead . 
  they just did not give a damn . 
  this is not an isolated event , this is the attitude they have toward any help we tried to give them . 
  they just do n't want it , they just want to live off the land and leave whenever people start hating them too much for it . 
  i wish we found a way to reason with them but i really gave up on them to be honest . 
  it is not so much the fact they commit more crimes necessarily , it is more their attitude to us . 
  numerous people have tried and helped them ( in france anyway , i do n't know elsewhere ) for example by giving them decent lodgings , it always ended up one way : them taking all the pipes and electric cabling and stripping the lodging bare and disappearing in the wild to sell it back , leaving the appartments destroyed . 
  there is only so much times this kind of thing can happen before people decide they are not worth helping and only come to hate them with a passion . 
  whether you are roma or not , if you are not agressively panhandling , wrecking shit or shitting in the streets people wo n't care about you . 
  now you talk about race but this is typically a us thing , in europe race is generally not really discussed , most of the problems are cultural things , not race things . 
  this is entirely true : http://www.adl.org/assets/pdf/press-center/adl-global-100-executive-summary-2015.pdf the row of antisemitic attacks in france provoked a great outrage , causing french people to be less antisemitic and feel a greater sense of kinship toward the french jewish community . 
  for those who do n't feel like reading the . pdf , before the attacks 50 % of french were worried about violence towards jews and since the attacks it swelled to 70 % . 
  since the attacks 81 % of french people agree to the fact that antisemitism is dangerous and 77 % think that `` attacks on jews affect everyone and are an attack against french way of life as a whole '' . 
  the pourcentage of french people harboring stereotypes towards jewish people also decreased from 37 % in 2014 to 17 % in 2015 . 
  `` godamnit , are you really robbing me with a bryco ?!, 
  now , i am offended ! '', 
  i understand that but where did people see that it was not `` actual stealing '' . 
  yeah i know it is done , does not mean it is not stealing . 
  so following your logic having police in any country is useless as it will `` become the most-coveted job blah blah blah amicable solution '' ? 
  tax evasion is actual stealing . 
  how in hell did you come to the conclusion that it was not ? 
  yeah and it is only worth it because you get checked every 10 years . 
  no , he is just an asshole and he is not pretending . 
  so you are willing to participate willingly in a misdemeanor for a small discount ? 
   what do you mean by enforcing ? 
  having a guy sit all day at every store and watch the transactions ? 
  just send plain clothed officers buy a pack of chewing gum or something . 
  if he does not get a receipt without asking : heavy fine . 
  an officer can visit 30 establishments in one day easily . 
   it 's actually quite hard to stop tax evasion on this level . 
  you need a lot of bureaucracy and a lot of tax officers for it . 
  it 's pretty easy . 
  send plain clothed officers in bars and restaurant : if they do n't get a receipt without asking assume it is a routine thing and fine the establishment heavily ( so it 's not worth the risk ) . 
  even if you control 1 on 10 establishment they will get scared and will stop pulling that shit at lightning speed . 
  sounds good . 
  let 's make a ten page `` voting conditions '' document that you will have to agree with before voting . 
  i saw my fair share of shitty troll wanabees since i got internet in the 90 's but you are probably among the least credible , try being less obvious it will work better . 
  the reason you can not make this kind of comparison on a state to state scale is that states are not made up of one person . 
  the person who benefits from the free money is generally not the person that ends up getting the shaft and crying on tv . 
  if we took your example and improved it to fit better , it would be two families . 
  the `` loan-guy '' would be a tyrannic father who took up all kind of loans without asking anyone else their opinion and giving only crumbs to the rest of his family , then when the bank comes to get the money back the guy would just empty all the bank accounts of the family then change country and change his name and let the rest of his family pay the loans he took . 
  so yeah sure the family benefitted slightly undirectly from the multiple loans ( maybe they had a better tv and ps4 that they could not have afforded ) but they never asked for them in the first place and only benefitted from them undirectly while the asshole father took up all the loans and used the money to live the great life and is nowhere to be found when it is time to pay the bills . 
  did you not read my comment or were you just itching to post your trolling comment and therefore disregarded the fact that it was irrelevant ? 
  honestly you french bashing people should really make up new stuff about us , these stereotypes are pretty overused . 
  yeah european diversity is dclauzel 's great crusade . 
  i do n't understand why people just choose to see arrogance in it , he just wants to see more of everyone 's own language . 
  in a way . 
  it has a reputation of corrupted police and politicians and violent mobs so it would be more something like chicago from the 30 's . 
  for a long time the corsican mob basically ran the city and used the gangs from poor districts as muscle , now the gangs have taken their independance and do the trafficking for their own gain . 
  there are some nice parts in the city of course but it still has very bad rep in france . 
  french humorist group called `` les inconnus '' described it as the first african city crossed by the paris-dakar . 
  the only way we could get to 100 % people employed today would be to invent always more useless `` bullshit jobs '' , why ? 
  no reason except that this way people are `` working '' even if working here means getting paid to sit on your ass in front of a computer doing absolutly nothing useful . 
  in short it is not working because it is needed , it is working for the sake of being able to say `` i am working '' . 
  whether we continue to make people compete for the few works there are ( driving salaries and working conditions in the process ) or we adress the fact that our societies absolutly do not need 100 % of people working full time and try experimenting with other better adapted systems . 
  is the basic income theory what we need ? 
  i do n't know maybe , maybe not . 
  we need to try it to truly know . 
  basically paying someone to come to your office and stay in front of a computer all day doing nothing really useful and paying someone to stay at home and do whatever they want is the same thing except that the one you force to come and remain at your office all day is 100 % sure to not be of any use to society as a whole . 
  the one you pay to do whatever they want may devote some of his time to volunteering , educating themselves , helping others etc. . . 
  even if only 10 % of people choose to do that it is still a net win compared to those who are stuck all day in useless jobs . 
  austerity has a meaning . 
  it is cutting costs on everything seen as not essential ( welfare , pensions etc. . ) . 
  explosives are generally used to open up armored transports which is a marseille specialty .

  i was talking about germany and france 's reconciliation more than germany 's reunification but your point stands , he was there at the right time . 
  i do n't know the first thing about kohl 's policies , what i meant is that in france we know him as the artisan of the reconciliation . 
  in france we got [ this photo ] ( http://france3-regions.francetvinfo.fr/lorraine/sites/regions_france3/files/assets/images/2014/09/22/000_par7981057.jpg ) in our history books . 
  yeah , i wish our lawmakers actually moved their ass to do something just anything to end this situation . 
  who said they were refugees ? 
  i wish they did here too . 
  we already do n't feed them , ngos do and we ca n't realistically prevent ngos from helping people not die of hunger , illegal as they are . 
  we used to have a camp but uk pressured sarkozy to have it closed in 2002 . 
  the punishment for illegally entering is deportation to your country of origin . 
  except we ca n't deport them if we do n't know where they are from . 
  it is a snake eating it 's own tail and the situation as it is is inextricable . 
  in most countries you can not just imprison people for undetermined duration without judgement . 
  you do n't understand . 
  they have no visa and no intention to apply for one . 
  they entered our country illegally they have no paper , no visa nothing . 
  every country in the world does what you are saying . 
  what about a blowjob and a cold beer too ? 
  you have to be kidding . 
  they are illegal migrants violating our laws . 
  they have no status . 
  they are illegals . 
  here too they have to justify why they are in danger and whatnot so that has to include their country of origin , except most of them do n't ask for refugee status here because they know that if they do n't disclose their country of origin they ca n't be deported . 
  that 's kind of a vicious cycle . 
  we should find an island somewhere and anyone not willing to disclose its country of origin gets deported there until they do so at least we could deport them somewhere but we ca n't do it the way law works currently . 
  and what if you can not determine their country of origin ? 
  sure but this is impossible to determine is what i am saying . 
   the guys do n't have papers and they know that if they tell where they come from they will be deported so they just have to shup up . 
  as others say it is basically a legal stalemate .

  so how many people can poland or romania ( the biggest ee countries ) take ? 
  then dude said : communism did a great job at solving the problems it created . 
  the same goes for the eu since day 1 . 
  wtf ? 
  honestly , why doesnt poland do a referendum ? 
  if you dont like it , have a friggin referendum . 
  is this an sm thing ? 
  how did solve the ukranian crisis ? 
  by buddying up the us and wanting to send arms in the region . 
  http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jun/14/us-poland-weapons-deployment-eastern-europe-russia because more deaths on each side with civilians trapped in the middle is a great thing . 
  how did france and germany solve the ukranian crisis . 
  by meeting putin and talking with him . 
  and since minsk ii there has been a fragile tranquility in the area . 
   because reu except sweden does n't have a notable banking sector itself frankfurt, 
  canary wharf is not in the city though . 
  so any proof ? 
  how does the engine detect it 's under test conditions without using any electronics ? 
  wait , i thought fracking does suck . 
  either way : just because it 's profitable in the us doesnt mean it would be in europe . 
  chevron pulled out of poland because it was useless . 
  also a lot of fracking companies are struggling because gas is cheap . 
  guys , here 's an idea . 
  instead of shitting on each other , lets shit on other countries . 
  we have here two of the best cuisines in the world . 
  what does norway have ? 
   if anything it 'll speed up ukrainian entry into nato . 
  no major european country wants that . 
  ask any random citizen if they want that . 
  look at the german and french reaction when poland and the us wanted to send arms to the ukranians : no fucking way . 
  and in terms of ukraine joining the eu : it has one of the most bad economies in europe . 
  that 'll have in several decades at least . 
  because gibraltar is anything like the current ukranian or georgian crisis ... edit : it all depends on russia . 
  bush wanted those countries to join in 2008 . 
  and putin made a huge nope out of it . 
  even regardless of that , european countries dont want ukraine or georgia in nato . 
  the only possible reslution is for ukraine to call it quits and give the region to russia . 
  crimea too . 
  as long as they 'll have large russian populations , there will always be a risk . 
  platini . 
  valcke is just corrupt in general as blatter 's right hand . 
  i cant czech what the article is saying, 
  nuff said, 
   are we looked at as walking wallets to prey upon and try and get as much money as they can get ? 
  ah yes . 
  because if someone cheats you of 10 euros , i 'm sure your personal finances will take a massive hit . 
   breaking into land illegally is not normal . 
  did the mayors provide the legal minimum accommodations ? 
  if not , then what do you expect ? 
   supposed to ever get a serious job if they 're brought up to be nomadic you dont and why should you if you wan na live like a nomad ? 
   not to mention that you did n't even answer half of my posts ' contents , such as them owning weapons like these , along with numerous smaller guns ? 
  how does that show they 're impossible to integrate into society . 
   nato ( as the only thing which can protect us from russia ) yeah that 's * never * going to happen . 
  do you think nato will accept in its rank a country that has active border problems with another state ? 
  the guy i 'm replying to was talking about `` values '' . 
  and i gave him an example where poland went against their previous rhetoric for political gain . 
  which is normal . 
  politics is about compromise . 
   gens du voyage often have their camps broken up . 
  thats because they pbbly broke into some land illegaly . 
  also mayors dont give them the minimal facilities . 
  those mayors should get fined so hard , it goes through their nose . 
   on the outskirts of society , that 's common knowledge . 
  they 're nomadic . 
  that 's their choice . 
  just like some people choose to be drifters or bums , that does n't mean that if they settle down , people will be racist to them or they 'll have problems adapting . 
  i 've seen business men bending over backwards to win contracts . 
  it 's the type of thing that happens . 
  politicians do it everytime . 
  some time or another , you have to kiss ass . 
  it 's just that when normal people do it , it 's not all over the news . 
   importantly to your own people . 
  that shit has a significant long term impact . 
  again . 
  it 's a non-news . 
  saudi folk are already used to the red carpet treatment . 
  and to the italians ? 
  this is just a circle-jerk ohmoagawd . 
  happened before too . 
  a few months ago they blocked a rally shitty beach in france . 
  i know the beach , really shitty . 
  it 's all gravel , no sand . 
  everybody and their mother were omg how dare the saudis . 
  now ? 
  no one remembers . 
  did n't poland say no quotas no quotas until voting time when they voted for ? 
   french gypsies are either deported deported ? 
  the fuck you talking about ? 
  to where . ? 
   they use them to kill each other in retarded disputes or to block highways , which they did recently . 
  so some are involved in minor organized crime . 
  omg noes such a surprise . 
  they still have to sign at the gendarmerie when they move to a new spot . 
  some prejudice might also exist . 
   also , in business people care about the business not dicks in marble . 
  you calculate trade-offs . 
  rag on statue 5 mins = investment to create value . 
  but hey when people are looking for jobs , i heard pride is good nourishment . 
  if it had n't been in the news , would you have given a shit ? 
   unless there 's two different sets of standards here . 
  no no , in france they got heckled by the french justice system .

  after having spent months sleeping in tents and on the floor , any sane person would feast as fuck if they get free housing . 
  not burn it down while their friends are inside . 
  there is no evidence or information to infer such a thing from this article . 
  the migrants have been on the road for months , that 's just a straight up fact , not an opinion . 
  i really doubt their first reaction would be to burn down their housing as soon as they get it after sleeping on the floor and in tents for such a long time . 
  i 'm not telling you to fall in love with migrants , you 're free to dislike them as much as you want , but use common sense before saying they burnt it down . 
  who in his right mind puts his own people at risk by leaving them in a burning building , just because they do n't like the location ? 
  the article says there were people who got sick from the smoke . 
  does it mean that they stayed in the burning building long enough to breathe in enough smoke to make it appear as an accident ? 
  if you want to criticize them , at least do it when it 's appropriate , if they start riots or something . 
  - `` oh , it smells bad in here . '', 
  - `` the migrants fart everywhere on purpose so that the locals leave and they can get free housing '' . 
  this is what you sound like to me . 
   when life was hard and death was so common . 
  exactly how it is in the middle east , as we speak . 
  jobless , poor , wars ... 
  that 's utterly insane , polls are used for so many things . 
  they give a good idea what people think . 
  it 's not the most accurate thing in the world , but it works . 
  i mean if you are going to start thinking like this , then you can never trust any poll that has ever been made ... 
  yeah these graphs are pretty cool . 
  says a lot . 
  pkk was founded as a response to turkish ultra nationalism . 
  it never existed before your people started to oppress mine . 
  if it were n't for the pkk , we would not have the rights we have today . 
   the hired assassin of the region under the command of imperial powers . 
  please stop this . . you are so obsessed with imperial westerners trying to take over turkey . .  children , especially a baby in a crib do n't even start man . 
  this video is just one more drop in a fucking ocean of unacceptable behavior . 
  i bet the perpetrators are n't going to get shit , maybe a little probation and they will be relaxed when it 's going to be forgotten about . 
  i hope everybody realizes that these actions only swell up the ranks of the pkk even more . 
  do n't be surprised if the sons and daughters of this man pick up arms and join the pkk . 
  that 's continental , no ? 
  what 's anatolian weather ? 
  and macaronesian sounds like a pasta dish, 
  it 's much more expensive to process . 
  saudi oil is of excellent quality . 
  you guys need a saakashvili . 
  they are rare , but they exist . 
  no problem with that , but if you 're not going to read the article you should n't vote or comment on it . 
  a motherfuckin ' gayfish . 
  text posts now generate karma too . 
  not retroactive though , so your old text posts are n't going to generate karma , only the new ones . 
  ah thanks for this !, 
  oh yes , not only lybia but over the course of france 's history , many more african countries !, 
  i do n't know much about sierra leone, 
   in no small part because the eu and us did n't want to get involve in someone else 's sovereign issues . 
  there was simply nothing to gain for them out of it . 
  germany was an ideological battle . 
  so was korea and vietnam . 
   because they just hate armenians out of nowhere . 
  a lot actually do hate them though . 
  `` armenian '' is an insult , they are seen as backstabbers and traitors that deserved what happened to them . 
  i 'm not saying everyone does , but definitely * lots * of people think this in turkey . 
  germany was split up in two , so was korea ( and it remains so to this day ) . 
  not good examples . 
  balkans are still fucked to this day , they are starting to arm up again and tensions are slowly rising . 
  they are poor as fuck . 
  kosovo is a mess , they hate each other . 
  as i said before , if you are going to intervene , go the entire way , do n't half ass it . 
  japan is the only truly successful and necessary invasion imo . 
  and it 's because the us had no other choice , and because they cleaned up after themselves . 
  what other examples can you think of ? 
  this is the kind of bullshit thought that lead to the most absurd and destructive wars in modern history . 
  the best way to prevent wars is to stop fucking around with other countries ' sovereignty , but if you really * have * to invade ( and some very exceptional cases require it ) , then you must assume the brunt of the responsibility of the result of the war , not pull out like a coward and leave everything in shit behind you . 
  * hon hon hon * , merci monsieur !, 
  if you do n't give me a recipe for an excellent egg sandwich , then you are a liar and deserve to have a hard boiled egg inserted inside of your rectum by a an old man with a moustache who smells like bleach . 
  dude this is so fucked up . 
  i feel really bad for you man . 
  i understand how a lack of freedom of speech feels like . 
  it feels really bad and is kind of scary . 
  i hope you get back to insulting whoever it is you want to insult , and make the jokes you want to make one day . 
  this is fucking crazy shit . 
  i have never heard of crazy shit like this before , tayyip is taking it to a whole new level , it 's scary as fuck . 
  well in any case , why not use a vpn ? 
  is it forbidden ? 
   there is so much i could say but i have a court order to not speak of such things again for some time otherwise i could get my ip tracked by the police again and taken back to the court again so thank you for reading . 
  are you serious ? 
  is this really a thing ? 
  boy he really wants that dick, 
  i do n't want to eat bleached chicken that is going to ruin our farms because it 's going to cost half the price of the local stuff . 
  i do n't want to eat hormones , and i do n't want atrazine in my veggies . 
  i do n't want iron supplements with 888 % of daily value ( true story ) or 24h energy drinks that turn you into a red-purple freak ( true story ) . 
  medecine in the us costs 20 times more than in france . 
  i do n't want the shitty agriculture , fucked up insurance and health lobbies to ruin our countries . 
  i do n't want gigantic lobbies to sue my country just because our government is not prostituting itself for election funds . 
  i do n't give a shit about the benefits retired german people are going to get when everything else is going to be ruined for us in france and in other countries . 
  i am completely against this nonsense , we are two different countries and have different needs . 
  she loves it because it will be great for the german industry ( cars , machines ) . 
  it 's going to be terrible for pretty much everything else . 
  especially for food and health products . 
  edit : typo, 
  once it 's washed and prepared , does it still smell ? 
  russia is really prone to indigestion in particular . 
  it was napoleon 's ulcer, 
  i 'll eat beans , sure , but breakfast ??? 
  where do you get such an appetite in the morning, 
  you do n't eat dinner because you ca n't digest your lunch and throw up alsace lorraine , 
  who in his right mind eats beans and sausages ... for breakfast ???? 
  they are sadly always forgotten . . 
  it 's just defeating isis that put them on the spotlight , when isis is gone , so are the kurds .

  you claiming that this law will have no impact on terrorism . 
  / u/petr0101 claiming that terrorist [ only buy guns on the black market . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5zbyj3/parliament_approves_revised_eu_gun_law_to_close/deww0h1/ ) so they wo ` nt be affected . 
  / u/arnold _ layne claiming that this law will have no impact on terrorism . 
  https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5zbyj3/parliament_approves_revised_eu_gun_law_to_close/deww1q8/ / u/k890 claims that these guns are all from the black market . 
  https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5zbyj3/parliament_approves_revised_eu_gun_law_to_close/dex09xc/ only / u/legalassassin _ swe mentions that yeah some loopholes are indeed closed . 
  he dislikes other parts of the law . 
  if you want to be fair , you should take what is good and say yeah this is good , and what you think is pointless , you say it 's crap . 
  but when you and several others say that this law is an utter turd and wo n't do `` jack shit for terrorism '' , we both know that it 's a lie . 
   problem was n't with better pan-european gun deactivation standards , well / u/zorthianator is constantly bitching about this law . 
  and at no point do i see him mention that stronger standards on deactivation need to be implemented . 
  after i called him out , did he start to say : okay yeah deactivation laws need to be stricter . 
   that various governments fail when young guys start radicalize and start plan terrorist attacks https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/apr/21/gang-found-guilty-of-uks-largest-known-gun-smuggling-operation here 's a crime gang that smuggles guns into the uk from ... you guessed it * slovakia * damn radical islamists . 
   you would agree on full nazi or full communist country because majority of french would want it ? 
  yes . 
  i heard the constitution of weimar germany or the constitution of czarist russia really helped . 
  lel  what if people like you were targeted , persecuted or even exterminated ? 
  what if random people get sent to a random island to be tortured , waterboarded , etc ? 
  yeah i kinda think that a constitution wo n't help me much . 
  you are claiming that this law will do nothing to prevent terrorism . 
  and i called bullshit . 
  this is one of the things this law includes :  the revised directive also strengthens the rules on marking firearms and clarifies the status of `` deactivated '' weapons ( newly deactivated guns will have to be declared to national authorities ) . 
  following pressure from parliament , the eu commission pledged to adopt , by the end of may 2017 and in collaboration with national experts , revised deactivation standards and techniques for ensuring that deactivated firearms are rendered irreversibly inoperable . 
   it wo n't help fighting terrorism because terrorists buy all equipment on the black market , what the fuck are you talking about ? 
  https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/apr/21/gang-found-guilty-of-uks-largest-known-gun-smuggling-operation http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/france/11420946/charlie-hebdo-shootings-automatic-rifles-used-in-paris-attacks-traced-to-shop-in-slovakia.html see [ this photo ] ( https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2015/01/08/09/charlie%20hebdo%20killers%20policemanv1.jpg ) . 
  that ak pointed to the policeman 's head , about to get executed . 
  you see it ? 
  that ak comes from * slovakia * , bought as a `` deactivated '' gun . 
  instead of talking bullshit , why not admit that slovakia fucked up by selling guns that could be easily reactivated . 
  i 'll take my chances . 
  uk is not exactly like france , where the police come and arrest you cuz they did n't like your tweets . 
  but thank you for presenting us other examples of beautiful free speech https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/jan/03/four-chelsea-fans-to-go-on-trial-over-paris-metro-racism :'), 
   are going to hate eu for a bit more . 
  maybe if your former bro slovakia did n't bother to sell rifles to terrorists that could be easily reactivated , you would n't be in this shit . 
  they can come and take my guns . 
   this will do jack shit to prevent terrorism . 
  seems to me slovakia has problems with its deactivation of rifles . 
   `` security loopholes '' ... yeah , right . 
  http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/france/11420946/charlie-hebdo-shootings-automatic-rifles-used-in-paris-attacks-traced-to-shop-in-slovakia.html https://www.wsj.com/articles/slovakia-shop-believed-to-be-source-of-guns-in-two-french-terror-attacks-1448629216 i 'm sorry . 
  you were saying ? 
  from the article  the revised directive also strengthens the rules on marking firearms and clarifies the status of `` deactivated '' weapons ( newly deactivated guns will have to be declared to national authorities ) . 
  following pressure from parliament , the eu commission pledged to adopt , by the end of may 2017 and in collaboration with national experts , revised deactivation standards and techniques for ensuring that deactivated firearms are rendered irreversibly inoperable . 
   and if le pen wins in france the same mechanism can be used to keep quiet other gits . 
  if a majority of french want to change the law , then so be it . 
   yeah - but we stopped fighting those borders still pretty shitty of uk to split europe in spheres of influence . 
  i 'll protest laws i wan na change . 
  like you know ... how it logically works . 
   i 'm also paying taxes in eu , just like many many millions of other people the many millions of europeans have decided to not pay that git . 
  that 's it boys . 
  break her legs !, 
   the precedent is the problem . 
  http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-39152562 guy was already fined before . 
  him and another were fined for doing a nazi salute . 
  there 's rules and regulations even in the european parliament and no it did n't turn into a commie censurised den . 
   i guess voltaire words where does voltaire say that i have to pay the guy to spew bullshit ? 
   typical french nationalist : kinda ironic when you also said this https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5z0ja8/the_latest_french_candidate_macron_condemns_turkey/deucuny/ i 'll just tag you as salty , 
   imo no speech should be disallowed unless it calls for direct action to perform acts of violence . 
  that 's nice . 
  * 1 / why do n't you start a political party then to change the laws . 
  * 2 / why do n't you move to the us where they 're more accepting to your views regarding free speech ? 
  the problem would be immediatly solved . 
  people who like it here , stay here , people who do n't , leave . 
   try again . 
  someone who claims great success at the city but does n't know who introduced the pricing methods for ir options . 
  neah . 
  you 're too succesful  ), 
   what about french french guiana ? 
  what 's your citizenship ? 
  not french ? 
  then do n't tell my country what to do with its territory . 
  cheerio . 
  honestly all threads related to refugees on / r/europe are shitshows and extensions of / r/european or other extreme right bullshit . 
  i admire anyone that has to guts to take on the specimens seen here . 
  not guts as in strength but guts as in capability to hold their food down . 
   no , i used to work in the city . 
  the city still needs hr . 
  and you were most likely bad at that job too . 
  many parts of the city was built by students and by reseach produced by nek or geman . 
   where i could justify paying someone more because they output more no one contradicts you here . 
  and we can talk about how foxconn and other big industrial giants that prefer to hire women because they can focus better , easier to manage and more dependable than men . 
  that 's neither here nor there . 
  these are jobs do n't pay well at all . 
   how many women are qualified/capable for those ? 
  3 % at best . 
  i see you work in hr . 
  you 're salty against women cuz a ton of them are your coworkers ? 
   what a victory for the eu parliament !, 
  indeed . 
  my tax money should n't go to this douchebag 's pockets . 
   i n't no way a twiggy blonde mary unpacks palettes of stuff as fast as beef swoleson . 
  those jobs usually do n't pay the most , 
  that 's what i 'm talking about . 
  god job european parliament . 
   so are cows . 
  whales as intelligent as cows ? 
  where the hell did you get that ? 
   the killing of one pregnant whale as ` two whales ' oh man . 
  i can already hear the pro-lifers, 
   to all expressions of religion actually all expressions of religion , philosophical , political ideas etc. 
  in order to achieve neutrality at the work place when it matters ( namely when interacting with other clients ) http://curia.europa.eu/jcms/upload/docs/application/pdf/2017-03/cp170030en.pdf,

  because of farm lobbies ( currently in france farmers are protesting and destroying eastern european products because they say it is unfair competition ) , and the belief they need to keep national production for `` food sovereignty '' ( as if we were in the risk of war against all our neighbours ) . 
  in reality they should definitely * not * subsidize farmers or impose quotas . 
  ( another reason would be that those subsidies are designed to kill competition in poor countries especially in africa , which now import cheap subsidized western frozen products instead of developing their own production . 
  it is not a `` hyper-secret pact '' , it is a treaty under negociation . 
  once there actually * is * a final agreement among negociators , and i remind that [ the eu parliament rejected private arbitration courts ] ( http://www.euractiv.com/sections/global-europe/european-parliament-backs-ttip-rejects-isds-316142 ) , it will be publicly available and debated in all concerned countries . 
  the treaty can only pass if it is approved not only by the us and by the eu parliament , but also by all national parliaments . 
  i know , does n't mean it 's not true though . 
  boring in the first sense , because of its bland , technocratic image , its focus on regulating the size of cucumbers , etc. 
  you 're right the current events are not exactly boring but i 'm not sure it 's such a good thing , 
  yes . 
  it 's no wonder the protesters in ukraine rallied around the idea of europe . 
  that word means far more than just the western peninsula of asia , or the boring eu . 
  whatever stereotypes americans have of europeans is irrelevant . 
  and it 'd be stupid to wonder if europe is like one big country , of course not , we have many different nations and cultures . 
  but it does n't mean `` we have nothing in common '' or that `` there is no european identity '' . 
  i 'd go as far as saying that europe is comparable to india , extremely diverse , barely ever united in history , but still with an undeniable common identity . 
  europe is a civilization . 
  we are the heirs of athens and of rome . 
  even the countries that were not part of the roman empire indirectly share this common heritage , as we also all share the heritage of christianity - in fact for centuries europe and christendom were the same thing . 
  during centuries all european countries though divided in different realms were united in a single political and religious system , in which noble families married each other and inherited lands in other countries . 
  our histories are inseparable , from the french kings of england partly vassals to the kings of france to the swedish king of poland-lithuania , the byzantine lords of montferrat , the king of bohemia ( czechia ) being germanic and roman emperor , the various monarchs ' plots to get control on the papacy , the polish and irish legions fighting for the french revolution , the congress of vienna trying to fix europe in the same way the european council now does , the countless small german nobles sent to become kings in every new country , etc. , etc. 
  but we are more than that . 
  we are da vinci naturalized french and erasmus travelling around europe , we are the `` republic of books '' , an intellectual and cultural community which ignores borders , and in which beethoven , smith , voltaire , kant , tolsto\u00ef , chopin , hugo , verdi , etc. 
  are all compatriots and the heritage of all people . 
  for a more striking example look at central europe before wwii : a center for all arts and sciences , with writers , painters , musicians , scientists of all ethnicities and nationalities mixing together . 
  we are also the civilisation that sailed all around the world , met and joined all the different peoples of the world , conquered and colonized entire continents , and shaped the world in its own image . 
  do you know why you ca n't think of any specifically european identity ? 
  that 's because the entire world is now very heavily influenced by the european civilization , from language to calendar , legal system , clothing , artchitecture or even to some extent way of thought . 
  and first of all countries , america , which is essentially a european colony . 
  of course given that global europeanization , it is now much more difficult to find something which defines all of europe but not any other country , compared to a few centuries ago . 
  but it 's still very much possible . 
  we have to generalize , of course , but still : european countries are almost all parliamentary democracies with proportional representation , a large welfare state , social rights , a high quality of life , high standards of production , largely secularized and increasingly non-religious , with similar political parties and issues , participating in the same sport and cultural competitions ( eurovision hehe ) , trading * heavily * with each other , with ( for many ) the same currency , no internal border , massive student exchange programs and tourism , being in the same geopolitical side and military alliance and finally belonging to the same political union with the same european elections , common institutions , common flag , common anthem , and so on . 
   a year in jail would have meant his dimission from public service and the loss of all pension claims . 
  would n't that be better ? 
  why would they want to keep a nazi who tortured his own students as a civil servant ? 
  that 's frightening and very strange compared to other countries . 
  that the socialist left-wing is discredited , i can understand . 
  but i would have guessed people would get progressively more socially liberal with time , pis would either lose support or become more moderate , and po would slowly get closer to the american democrats . 
   pis says they are going to `` fix '' the media when they get to power . 
  damn . 
   recently kukiz guy appeared , an ex-rockstar , now right-winged politican who claims that the only way to avoid two-party system is to introduce single-member voting districts are they brain-damaged ? 
  single-member majority voting is precisely the best way to * get * a two-party system , certainly not to avoid it . 
  on top of countless , countless other problems like [ gerrymandering ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gerrymandering#effects_of_gerrymandering ) and safe seats for life . 
  how exactly is proportional representation pushing for a two-party system anyway ? 
  the chart is based on national parliaments . 
  and you only have one ukip mp . 
  soon enough i 'll make a better one based on votes ( probably on votes in the last eu election to avoid the bias of national issues and strategic voting ) . 
  you attacked the pope once ? 
  nice try , france sent one of its state ministers to punch the pope in the face and kidnap him . 
  snp and plaid cymru are both social-democratic parties as far as i know , so pes . 
  we 're talking about saint-john-paul-ii-land . 
  i would n't say i 'm surprised . 
  christian lebanese immigrants are extremely successful and well integrated pretty much anywhere they go . 
  the chart does n't give 70 % to social-democrats in italy . 
  you 're also counting the five star movement , which i had some trouble classifying but ended up putting in the far-left since in my opinion they 're more ecosocialist and very different from the ukip or national front , which have better equivalents with lega nord and fratelli d'italia . 
  i still verified the numbers and it seems i forgot the latter 's 8 mps ( which does n't change much on 630 ) . 
  that 's how i classified tw\u00f3j ruch , which is n't part of any european party . 
  you probably know more about them than i do , so feel free to correct me . 
  as i said elsewhere i purposely split the efa members according to their actual ideology . 
  it gives a better picture than just lumping both right-wing and left-wing regionalists together and with the greens , as in the european parliament . 
  really ? 
  sorry , my mistake . 
  when i make a better chart based on people 's votes rather than seats , i 'll make sure to correct that . 
   yeah . 
  so i guess for example pvv has been included in the efdd-enf category ? 
  yes , they 're members . 
   i also would ask about front national , but googling their number of seats : `` 2 of the 2,026 seats up for election '' ( with 15 % of the votes ) . 
  why do all european countries have such non-representative ways of dividing seats ??? 
  the front national is also in that group , and the two mps are shown in the graph . 
  you 're right they are absolutely not fairly represented in the french parliament ( 2 seats on 577 , though , not on 2026 ) . 
  that 's because of the voting system , which is not proportional but majoritary with two rounds , meaning that all mps need the majority in their district to get elected . 
  even when the national front scores high , people then generally quite massively vote against it in the second round . 
  the system has some logic but i think it would be better to have all parties fairly represented ; the current system pushes to a two-party system , which limits people 's choice . 
  other than france , the uk has an even worst system since voting is majoritary but with only one round , meaning that not only parties are very unfairly represented , but most mps are * not * backed by a majority and only received around 35 % of the votes in their district . 
  but then as far as i know , all eu countries have a form of proportional representation , so it 's not fair to lump all of them together like that . 
  i 've heard germans complain that their treshold to enter parliament is too high ( 5 % ) , but i think it 's pretty reasonable , and it 's only bad luck if some parties end up falling under it . 
  well the results for the whole eu would be roughly similar to the [ composition of the eu parliament ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_parliament ) , i presume . 
  this is based on national parliaments , so i guess the electoral rules have something to do with it . 
  in italy i think you have a bonus for the winning coalition , right ? 
  i 'll try to do another chart for the votes instead of the seats , it would tell more about public opinions . 
  france has alde members but they 're not liberals , they 're `` centrists '' ( very moderate conservatives and non-ideological pragmatists ) . 
  or rather they refuse to admit they 're liberal . 
  the french absolutely hate economic liberalism for some reason , at least in name . 
  i think in eastern europe those liberal parties are closer to the left because the right-wing is more socially conservative , while in western europe the `` conservatives '' are almost as much socially liberal as them so they 're extremely close politically and it 's quite natural for them to ally . 
  i did n't put the quotation marks for nothing . 
  that 's how they 're generally called but i know it 's a loaded term . 
  as for the eaf ... do you mean the european free alliance ? 
  i distinguished the member parties by political positioning rather than grouping left-wing and right-wing regionalists all together with the greens as in the european parliament . 
  it gives a better picture . 
  at first i did n't know whether to count alde as right-wing , that 's why i ranked countries alphabetically . 
  but since i was asked , i made the alternate version . 
  as for the five star movement , that was one of the most puzzling choices to make , since it is pretty original and does n't have exact equivalents in other countries . 
  i grouped it with the far left because of all the groups that 's in my opinion where they 'd fit the best . 
  i know they 're called populist and sit with efdd but i think ideologically they 're still much closer to syriza and podemos than to ukip or the national front , which have a better italian equivalent with the lega nord . 
  i know this is all contestable of course . 
  [ here it is , then . 
  you mean member ? 
  this is a chart of national parliaments ( lower houses ) and there is only one ukip mp , who is represented but of course almost invisible . 
  you 're right about the uk , but it is wrong to say p\u00e9tain `` had no choice to accept the german armistice terms '' . 
  before p\u00e9tain took power , the government wanted to retreat to algiers with the navy and as much troops as possible , and keep fighting from there with full control of the colonial empire .

what language is it ? 
  i find it amazing that on a forum where i stumble on this song every week at least , it 's the french that are described as arrogant ... 
  added , thanks, 
  ... which in turn is standing on the shoulders of mozart , haydn , bach , etc. 
  i would n't dare to compare composers , because while some of them look like absolute geniuses that have produced countless masterpieces , they 're never the end-all of it . 
  music is lovely in that after centuries using the same notes and the same instruments , some people manage to have you think * their * art was invented yesterday . 
  but still ... haydn ... 
   bout your ideal europe , see how really it is and makes you want to blow it all up or sit and cry for what it could have been . 
  it 's still time to do it . 
  they repeat the same stuff a lot , as usual in choral pieces . 
  also the short version you 're used to is an excerpt of the this piece . 
  in some of the things we sang , we spent 1-2 minutes singing the same word over and over ... :p, 
  it 's the same piece ; you 're linking to an arrangement by karajan to make it more anthem-like . 
   i love the lyrics by schiller , and the musical theme arranged by karajan that is used as anthem of europe to be honest , i 'm not a fan of this version . 
  it 's ok as an anthem , but once you listen to the 9th , you soon find out that as a musical piece , it 's miles away from the original ( also i love opera singing !, 
  whataboutism . 
  it 's funny to see * leaked * us diplomatic cables quoted whenever the us are exposed as spies . 
  it 's also funny that the last time we heard about us spying ( a week ago , lol ) , many us redditors were saying that the us did n't do economic intelligence , as opposed to the french . 
  got to sing it , and i find it amazing so little people around me know about it . 
  this version is directed by kurt masur and played by the choir and the orchester of radio-france ( french public radio network ) . 
  the original lyrics are in german , but they were translated in many languages ; [ here are some ] ( http://www.lvbeethoven.com/oeuvres/music-europeananthem-odetojoy.html ) . 
  if you have other translations ( we 're 28 countries after all ) , post it below , i 'll update . 
  edit : [ latin lyrics ] ( http://www.hymnus-europae.at/ ) [ lithuanian version ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgcbfmznn6o&amp;feature=youtu.be ), 
  not sure i like the `` backyard '' concept . 
  i would rather say it 's right across the street . 
   apparently courtney love cobain live-tweeted her experience . 
  imo that 's s a pr stunt from the taxis to appear more friendly . 
  `` sure we assault people , but among them , is courtney love '', 
  i have seen a french documentary about french extremist involvement in the conflict , and apparently our neo-nazis were on both sides . 
  as for the open nature of it on the ukrainian side , i guess it 's mostly due to the fact that ukrainians ca n't really afford to go to war without them . 
  otherwise , they 're quite anecdotic politically , and got destroyed in the elections . 
  actually , it 's quite weird . 
  there are both far left and far right millitiamen from all across europe in both sides . 
  if only them got shot , this war would be much less dramatic . 
   i 'm curious though how cabbies handle uberpop in other countries ? 
  is it only in france that they go full retard ? 
  basically , they 're getting wiped out . 
  prodigal ! = prodigy . 
  -- the joke --  me, 
  the uk has a reputation for lack of police controls , ease to find a job without papers once you 're on the national territory . 
  on the other hand , it 's almost impossible to live as anyone else without papers in france , because you need papers for any legal job , to rent a place , etc. 
  so by living in england , they have a chance to live a `` normal '' life , while in france , their paperless status threatens to catch up with them at any time . 
  less fraud , and for much smaller amounts . 
  ... says the guy with a `` count [ ... ] '' nickname . 
  i heard it 's a thing in russia ( that would explain the name ) , but that looks quite disgusting :p at least , not very healthy . 
  btw , i bought torro when i came to barcelona , but from what i gather , it was a specialty from other places in spain . 
  is there a torro specialty from barcelona ? 
   is `` russian salad '' ( amanida russa ) popular outside of spain ? 
  i have n't seen it when i travel and it 's one of the best summer dishes !, 
  is your salad drowning in mayo ? 
  i meant tapas in that you 're served several small plates with bread & tomatoes to eat them . 
  i also like the kind you can find in e.g. 
  carrer de blai , but that 's not my main pleasure . 
  i also ate in small places around joanic , but mostly seafood :d . i 'll try escudella next time :d, 
   if you want to visit us you should probably never come on summer i came in january , and again in late april . 
  i love the city but i 'm not a fan of summertime  . 
  still , gaudi places were crowded . 
   and if you 're after museums , did you check out our science museum ? 
  nope . 
  to be honest i spent a fair share of my time walking around the streets and shopping eateries . 
  walking down a street in bcn feels like walking shadows in amber 's books : the landscape never stops changing . 
  and there 's the food , it 's like the city : you 've got so much diversity in the food that often picking several tapas rather than a full dish is the way to go . 
  can you imagine yourself eating only seafood ? 
  man , i love pulpo but that 's only one of many good things . 
  i 'll take notes for my next trip tho , 
  [ i need more than gaudi ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zls-npemqyq ) :p . but seriously , i have seen things that i enjoyed much more than gaudi 's work in bcn . 
  the mnac has one of the most gorgeous roman collections in europe , for instance . 
  and i enjoyed the quietness of reading a book in the santa creu garden ( maybe i was lucky on the lack of tourists , granted ) more than the crowded casa batlo visit . 
  my point is n't that everyone will want to see these ; it 's that the gaudi-mania is overshadowing some of these . 
  and we 're back to the point where barcelona 's strength is not fully exploited : it 's the most diverse city i got to visit , but you would n't know that if you listen to some tourist guides . 
   gaud\u00ed is the paradigm of barcelona . 
  i totally disagree here , and while i enjoyed gaudi 's work , i would probably not recommend more than a day 's worth of visiting gaudi stuff in a week . 
   and if someone does n't value our other stuff it 's beacause they 're idiots and do n't bother reasearching were they 're traveling to why advertise gaudi 's stuff then ? 
  man , fuck gaudi . 
  there 's so much about barcelona that is not valorized because it 's not gaudi ... barcelone 's architectural uniqueness comes from the diversity of its buildings , and the experimental atmosphere of the early xxth . 
  it 's sad to reduce it to gaudi . 
  also , food . 
  food is what i love in barcelona . 
  well , what 's a soul in the first place ? 
  maybe you 're weird to think it 's obvious , when you would n't give a definite answer for humans ? 
  what about angels ' gender ? 
  can you really discuss about the nature or properties of something you ca n't observe ? 
  the teacher is n't wierd , he 's only trying to have students drown in their own contradictions . 
  we do n't worship billboards , indeed . 
  we will put anything on them . 
  the problem about tax avoidance is n't business localization . 
  it 's the localization of the benefits derived from such business : in our case , the business may be located in germany or greece , the key point is that taxes should then paid the country where the business is done , not in some remote country with favorable tax code . 
  and for that matter , germany , greece , france are not competing ; we 're equally robbed by tax havens . 
  the idea to unify taxes to combat tax avoidance derives from the lax rules around localization of profit , which are hard to fix in a common market . 
  and imo , if such thing is done , it should come hands in hands with regional development funding . 
  also to answer your question , real estate and labour cost is cheaper in greece than in germany . 
  it 's a common pun on / r/france to make silly en -  fr translations . 
   they might not be willing to participate in the current insane policy of accepting and even aiding all migrants to reach europe . 
  that 's a very strange conception of solidarity . 
  i wonder if you would deem the policy that was applied to eastern europe in the 90 's -2000 's insane . 
  question is so vague that people are forced to `` guess '' what fighting for one 's country means . 
  of course , the guess is very different depending on one 's geopolitic situation : obviously the finnish would be more willing to defend their country against a russian invasion than the germans would be to invade a random third-world country .

they usually are [ rather big stores ] ( http://www.helexia.eu/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/centrale-photovolta\u00efque-helexia-leroy-merlin.jpg ) , in commercial areas around mid-sized and big cities . 
  they 're called brico d\u00e9p\u00f4t or leroy merlin * ( or even saint-maclou , castorama or ikea if you 're very generous with the term `` hardware store '' ) * , look like [ industrial depots ] ( http://www.philips.com/consumerfiles/newscenter/main/shared/assets/fr/newscenter/press/brico-depot/brico-depot-1lrg.jpg ) , and have a drive-thru just outside [ for big things you 're not going to put in a shopping cart ] ( http://www.rennes.maville.com/shopping/sites/maville.com.shopping/files/styles/normale/public/field/image/commerce/15-07-06/img_1619_0.jpg?itok=vxp8o91o ) . 
  trade the union of england and wales for [ north sentinel island ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/north_sentinel_island ) . 
  they are both islands inhabited by people that do not want anything to do with us anyways , but north sentinel island is way smaller , so we might actually get direct boats to scotland and skip the middle man . 
  in france , you do n't need a driver 's licence to drive a scooter , just a bsr ( or am driver 's licence ) .

  i 'm posting from a phone , so i do n't have prices in mind . 
  i 'll add things later , but here 's something in case you want to start planing right away . 
  well i guess you could go for france first and last ( plane ticket should be less if you arrive and depart from the same airport , and the two airports you 're sure to have flights to from anywhere in the world are paris cdg and london heathrow ) . 
  you could add three neighbouring countries ( out of belgium , germany , switzerland , italy , spain and ireland . 
  i purposely left out luxembourg and andorra : they are small , you should not go there with a 4-countries ticket ) . 
  if i had that kind of opportunity , i would first spend one day in paris , two if you like museums and want to see the louvres . 
  if i had to do paris in a day , i 'd do notre dame , montmartre and le marais . 
  add the eiffel tower , because even if it 's overrated as fuck , you 'll look like a moron back home if you went to paris and did not get a photo of it . 
  then i 'll go to normandy . 
  because it 's pretty . 
  head to the saint lazare train station , and take a train to caen ( or a train to cherbourg , they stop in caen ) . 
  the trip takes 2h . 
  in caen , you 'll see what a beautiful french city look like , filled with a medieval castle , fucktons of churches , nice houses and restaurants , and nice parks . 
  there is also the biggest world war 2 museum , le m\u00e9morial de caen , if you 're into that . 
  then take a train to cherbourg . 
  trip takes 1h12 optional stop in bayeux , where you can see a cathedral , the bayeux tapestry , and take a bus to the dday beaches . 
  in cherbourg , you are waiting for a boat that will take you to ireland !, 
  waiting for the boat , you can visit la cit\u00e9 de la mer , a big museum about the sea . 
  the two highlights of the museum are a whole exhibition on the titanic with a heartbreaking room shaped like the front of the boat with a giant screen showing the sea and entries from passengers ' diaries and boat 's telegraphs . 
  then the iceberg comes out of nowhere and ypu can live minute by minute the distress of everyone with the soss sent and the replies from other boats . 
  still moves me two years after visiting it . 
  the other highlight of the museum is that you can visit a real nuke-launching submarine . 
  so now you took the boat to ireland . 
  eurail website says you get a massive discount for this boat with your pass . 
  ( there is n't a boat everyday , plan accordingly ! ) . 
  what do you do in ireland ? 
  i have no fucking clue , i never went there , ask an irishman . 
  when you 're done with ireland , take the boat back to cherbourg , take a train to caen , but stop at lison and take a train to rennes . 
  stop at pontorson : here is le mont saint michel , sometimes nicknamed eight wonder of the world !, 
  then i guess you could go to rennes . 
  and take a train to the south . 
  you ca n't see a lot of beautiful things in brittany unless you have a car . 
  try saint-malo of you need to fill in gaps in your trip , but unless you rent a car , not much else to see . 
  i do n't know enough about the rest of europe ( except for scandinavia ) to do it justice , so i wo n't do something as detailed . 
  you have all of southern france to visit . 
  i would absolutely go to italy too . 
  that leaves you with one other country . 
  i would do all of italy then take a discounted boat to greece . 
  but if you have enough antiquity things in italy , i 'd go to austria . 
  so france ireland france italy [ greece - austria ] italy france . 
  but that 's just what i 'd do . 
  are there things that please you in this draft . 
  could you please give us some of your group 's interests ? 
  you could even reply with `` tags '' ( for instance `` churches , world war ii , italian food , cows , sailing , computers '' ) . 
  it would greatly help us direct you to routes relevant to your interests . 
  edit : number of days you plan on staying and approximate budget would be cool too . 
  edit 2 : also which country do you come from ? 
  ( this could influence which airport we tell you to go to ), 
  it seems you can not go to gb with eurail .

  wow , at least the few preachers we have in france ( jehova 's witnesses mostly ) give bibles away for free ... buying them ? 
  really ? 
  i live in france . 
  though christianism left traces everywhere ( [ see for instance this eleventh century church just outside my window ] ( http://i.imgur.com/cxapjgn.jpg ) ) , absolutely no one believes in `` god '' . 
  most people are n't religious at all , and the scarce people that still believe in something ( < 10 % of the population ) do believe in a concept , a set of tacit rules that supposedly makes everyone 's life better ( you should not kill , you should not bang your neighbor 's wife , a family is a father and a mother , and so on ) , and not that there is a guy somewhere in the sky that watches you fap . 
  people that still go to mass on sundays usually do it for the community , to see other people you might not be able to see otherwise in the week . 
  we stopped taking the bible in a literal way centuries ago . 
  i was raised in a catholic school ( in france there are 36 930 catholic classes as opposed to 246 335 non-catholic ones ) , and even my catechesis teacher were emphasizing that what is written in the bible are parables , that jesus did not make fish and bread magically appear , but that he shared stuff he had ; that jesus giving the other cheek was a way of saying `` try to stop conflict instead of feeding the troll '' ... 
  they even had us read some passages of the leviticus to make us realize that everyone in the classroom would have to be stoned to death if we took a book for law . 
  even the most hardcore christian in europe most likely takes the theory of evolution for a fact , as much as he believes that the theory of gravity is a fact too . 
  the only things where and when we see religiousness all over everything are for instance when gay marriage was voted last year , but no one was saying `` god hates fag '' or things like that : most religious people were expressing concerns about how gay families would fit in with the rest of society ( for instance , in schools , children usually do a gift for their mothers on mother 's day and a gift for their fathers on father 's day . 
  what about children that have two mothers or two fathers ? 
  would n't that disturb children to have to call a father a mother or a mother a father ? 
  and so on ) . 
  and , even as a guy which is all for gay marriage being allowed , i think most of those are valid points , at least points we should take care about . 
  all in all , religious people are seen as harmless grandpas . 
  it 's nice to have them around , with all their conservatism and all . 
  and even though in the end the younger generations ( laics ) will most likely win the debates , it 's nice to have heard their arguments before , as they think of the welfare of the community before the welfare of individuals , which is something to take care about . 
  but no one would ever think of putting an old grandpa in a school or at the head of a state , for instance . 
  and on the reverse , normandy is not on the map while it as a pretty strong autonomist movement ( but not an independantist one ) . 
  each time this kind of map shows up on / r/mapporn , everyone is reacting on how wrong they are , and come to the conclusion that the sub should team up and make a good one . 
  and each time nothing gets done , 
  if you mean demographic growth , here is a list including all the cities . 
  www.toutes-les-villes.com/villes-croissance.html edit : key is : * number * city * growth in ten years ( % ) * population ( inh . ), 
  * national rank, 
  you 're lucky they even accepted it . 
  most shops look at you angrily if you pay with 100 $ notes , and just refuse payments with 200 and 500 $ notes . 
  order in which to do things , according to [ diplomatie.gouv.fr ] ( http://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/fr/venir-en-france-22365/formalites-d-entree-en-france/article/quel-type-de-visa-solliciter ) : * find yourself a job in france before you go * your employer will have to declare that he 's going to hire a foreigner to his local d.i.r.e.c.c.t.e. 
  * you will then be able to get a foreign job authorization * this authorization is required to be able to create a work visa coming from the us , you should have no problems getting your work visa as long as you can find a job there first . 
  remote jobs and such are subjected to the exact same rules . 
  also , i hope you can french . 
  otherwise , ** good . 
  f * cking . 
  luck . 
  from france , university of caen ( normandy ) : * you are required by law to have your id card at all times with you , anywhere . 
  * policemen can check your id whenever and wherever they deem necessary * ( i must be unworthy of checking since i never actually got id checked ) * . 
  * however , policemen can not enter on university grounds unless invited to do so by the president of the university . 
  * * a private security company is present at all times at the university , but they ca n't legally force you to id check . 
  they are here for peacekeeping and dissuading thieves and graffers .

not regular jobs , but the kind of crappy jobs illegals do everywhere . 
  no ids in uk & they mostly speak ( basic ) english only . 
  it 's therefore much easier for them to find jobs in britain . 
  so is the new channel tunnel calais to dublin ? 
  schuman declaration , 1950 : the pooling of coal and steel production should immediately provide for the setting up of common foundations for economic development as a first step in the federation of europe . 
  ... by pooling basic production and by instituting a new high authority , whose decisions will bind france , germany and other member countries , this proposal will lead to the realization of the first concrete foundation of a european federation indispensable to the preservation of peace . 
  1954 : bulletin from the european community for coal and steel # 1 : [ towards a federal government of europe ] ( http://aei.pitt.edu/43475/1/a7384.pdf ), 
  i do n't think that 's the reason . 
  no matter if i buy on fr/uk/de / it , it 's always billed by amazon eu sarl in luxembourg . 
  the way i see it , it 's no longer about right or left , even though i wish it still was . 
  i mean , we have people who actively want to destroy the basic ideas post-1945 western liberal democraties were build on , and they are actually winning elections . 
  it 's a matter of damage control for me at this point , hopefully fighting this wave just long enough for trump/brexit to fail and discredit populist ideologies elsewhere . 
  then we 'll come back to normal politics , i hope . 
  so far , 2017 has been going well enough . 
  trump ca n't even rule its own party , much less the usa , the uk still has no idea what sort of brexit it wants , the netherlands rejected populism massively and it looks like france is headed to elect its most pro-eu president yet next month . 
  i 'm cautiously optimistic that everything might be okay in the end . 
  it 's consistent ( and at the same dates ) because it 's an eu regulation since the 90s . 
  maybe the uk will choose its own different changing dates now just because . 
  we are not , it 's quite a hard process to get a schengen visa then naturalisation . 
  i worked with a muslim phd student from tunisia who had to go though a lot of questioning/paperwork in order to first get her visa and eventually naturalisation as a french citizen with a right to live in france & the eu . 
  it took years and she had to renew her yearly visa months in advance each time until her naturalisation was accepted . 
  today , that 's true . 
  a few hundred years back and until the 19th century , radical christians murdered people and took over country just the same way . 
  if changed happened in christians countries when they developped , i do n't see why it could n't be the same for muslim countries . 
   the eu works do you ? 
   here 's an example : in the 80 's sure , if we dissolved the eu today , terrorists groups would go : `` hey , we can stop planning attacks in paris , brussels & london , they dissolved the eu ! '', 
  the problem is that most people do n't care to know . 
  everything is available on the various eu websites on every languages . 
  too many retreats . 
  populists take over countries and we fall back . 
  they assimilated the uk , us , and we fell back . 
  not again !, 
  the line must be drawn in france , ... this far , no further !, 
  i think the fact that , 25 years on , we still call eu citizens moving though the union `` immigrants '' shows us part of the issue . 
  even if if the current eu fail , i believe a core france-benelux - germany will reappear soon afterward . 
  really :o . 
  that 's very weird . 
  no idea . 
  so much unknown . 
  it 's the same with things like warranty . 
  pretty much all electronic i have today has a eea-wide warranty . 
  hopefully , if the uk will keep at least minimal integration with the eu ( the same way canada is with the usa in nafta ) . 
  i 'd rather avoid having a government that will leave the euro and devaluate my saving , destroy the eu and fuck the economy for as long as possible . 
  it 's down to this . 
  great idea , i 'm near calais to receive , just need an accomplice over in kent to form a post brexit amazon drone smuggling ring :d . 
  yes , and like norway . 
  but those countries are still part of the single market , so you only have limited customs/rule of origin to worry about , that already simplify matters greatly . 
  and even then , it 's not as open as the irish border today . 
  in many places , there is still customs stops and some places are fenced off to prevent smuggling . 
  [ http://static.panoramio.com/photos/large/106171696.jpg] ( http://static.panoramio.com/photos/large/106171696.jpg ), 
  well , bluray are still the best way to watch a movie/tv show . 
  it 's still above streaming as for video compression . 
  since i have the newest seasons on bluray , i feel a compulsive need to buy the rest of the show on physical media as well in order to have a consistent collection . 
  french here optimistic about the future elections ? 
  not me , i 'm 28 and in every election in the last 4 years , i have voted for someone i disagree with on most things in order to avoid someone even worse . 
  yes , we do . 
  i also buy a lot of kindle english book though amazon ( so uk books that are available to other amazon europe stores ) . 
  i liked the part about ireland as well . 
  we 'll somehow maintain the cta , an open border and leave the custom union . 
  with `` somehow '' yet to be defined . 
  that 's the point . 
  we might as well get it over with . 
  as of today , trump is not yet in office , the uk is still in the eu . 
  yet we know those will change and there 's nothing to be done . 
  i wish it was 2020 and everything was done . 
  i do not enjoy seing the western world i was born in burn and disappear in slow motion . 
  in a funny way , as someone who live in northern france , i hope it means going to the uk will be cheap again when duty free comes back to life on ferries and eurotunnel . 
  yes , or fr/it/es , since it 's for the time being the same thing . 
  but the uk wo n't be leaving the eu overnight , there 's still at least two years . 
  if i 'm fast enough , i should be able to order the rest of bbc classic doctor who dvds before customs are back up :p . 
  today , amazon uk , fr , de , it , es , are 5 differents fronts of the same thing . 
  amazon eu sarl . 
  if you order from uk , your order could be sent from anywhere in those countries since those are all amazon eu and they share their warehouses . 
  post brexit , amazon uk will probably be split and become independant . 
  so orders will only come from the uk and will have to go though customs . 
  me too , and i think strengthening organisations like the eu , nafta , asean , south american union was the most likely way to eventually reach a global common market based on the same rules and values . 
  i do n't see it happening anymore after 2016 . 
  wait a second , what was the point of 6 months of preparation to basically say `` we 're leaving everything and that 's it . '', 
  american do n't have the right for their state to leave their union . 
  last time some tried , it ended badly . 
  an id card is enough for any eu/efta country ( even non schengen members ) . 
  really ? 
  i was born in calais and i always saw england like this multiple time a year on sunny/clear days . 
  one french provider started offering eu roaming for free in 2014 , others followed and hence for the last year and a half , most people have had eu-wide roaming already . 
  indeed , be careful with switzerland . 
  since it 's not in the eea , it 's very often way more expensive . 
  many french networks have already allowed eea wide roaming for the last year in advance . 
  the only downside i can think of is that you need to really remember to disable roaming when leaving europe . 
  since i move a lot between france / uk / belgium , i have kept roaming on all the time for the last year . 
  took a plane to china , roamed for 2 min there when i turned my phone back on before noticing it . 
  cost me 20 $ . 
  there need to be an eea roaming option on phones . 
  still , they have a right to complain about the government vision of brexit , especially since the final destination in unclear . 
  i mean , nobody know for sure where the uk-eu relation is going at the moment . 
  it could go all the way from eea-lite to hard full brexit with something nafta-like ( fta , easement for workers to work in each other coutries and some common regulation ) in between . 
  but why do you think all those people are campaigning ? 
  it 's to keep the issue/debate alive until things can change eventually , not plan for an armed coup against the british government . 
  if i were british , i 'd do anything i can to help with the fight . 
  ( to be honest , even not being british today , i feel bad enough about the situation to want to do something ) . 
  that 's the exact same thing .

  why put your border in the south east of france and not the south west ? 
  that does not make sense to me . 
  the french basque and toulouse regions are culturally as much southern as the south eastern part of france . 
   is it as alright as most british unis are ? 
  yes . 
  france and especially universities are at least as diverse as british ones . 
  edit : more so in large urban centers , obviously . 
  physics is not my domain , but for france , you can look at the [ cea portal ] ( http://www.cea.fr/english-portal ) . 
  interestingly , one of the cea 's creator was fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric joliot-curie , and the us doe was partly modelled on the cea . 
  i am not sure why you are asking about getting a eu citizenship . 
  it should not be necessary unless you work in highly sensitive areas . 
  it gets even more crazy than that . 
  many researchers in france are in groups of one university and one research centre called umr ( i am simplifying here ) . 
  so in many scientific articles from scientists in france , you will see their address as umr1234 . 
  this is totally undecipherable by those guys doing this lists of top universities , resulting in a very large part of french research to be unclassified . 
  i believe ( i am not in public research anymore ) that they are encouraged , now , to use an address such as university xyz , umr1234 . 
  that 's 2 different countries , at least since 1812 or so . 
  comparing the two is ridiculous . 
  many men are circumcised and still can enjoy sex . 
  women that are circumcised have their clitoris mostly removed !, 
  this is a different kind of mutilation . 
  i am against both , but it 's like comparing wolf whistling a woman and rape . 
  the two are abusing women , but one is much worse than the other . 
  please do n't compare male circumcision with female mutilation . 
  it 's an insult to those poor women . 
  this [ map ] ( http://i.imgur.com/qve9izv.jpg ) i saw on / r/mapporn some time ago might explain why it can not be automatic . 
  in some area of africa , over 80 % of women are mutilated . 
  there could potentially be millions of women seeking asylum . 
  with lots of hebrew mixed into it , hence `` mostly based '' . 
  yiddish is mostly based on germanic languages . 
  also , it is a bit tricky . 
  one of the french samples contained the sound of the voice of some guy talking with a rather strong african accent .

  yep , solid . 
  still , you should not take fashion tips from her . 
  i see what you mean , but the violence in la marseillaise is over the top . 
  it 's also pretty sexist , but that 's another problem . 
  i will not teach this song to my 4 year old son for instance , because it 's about throat cutting of women and sons , fields of blood , ... 
  it 's too much for his age . 
  also , i agree that even in recent history violence against oppression has been necessary ( even more recent for ireland than france ) , it 's better taught in schools , than sung at rugby matches ( except when we play england !, 
  people are using downvotes to voice disagreement again !, 
  but i agree with you . 
  it 's about a very violent past and i 'd rather have lyrics about a beautiful peaceful future . 
  lettonie in french . 
  it 's hard for me to remember that lettonie = latvia, 
  my father is 1 cm taller than me ( 177cm ) . 
  and he suffered from malnutrition during wwii . 
  schengen did not remove all custom checks . 
  it removed systematic checks only . 
  i bet the french custom had a tip that this guy was carrying a lot of money . 
  fip radio . 
  they play a gigantic number of songs , hardly ever repeating themselves . 
  i believe it 's something like 30k per year which could be a worldwide record . 
  if you do n't know fip , it 's worth trying . 
  i like a lot about belgium . 
  beers , food , humour , les ardennes , painters , did i say humour ? 
  reminds me of this american comedian who went to amsterdam . 
  in the morning he went to a bakery where a big blond woman says `` dag ! '' . 
  he replied `` oh , you speak klingon too ! '', 
  as a non dutch who has lived in the netherlands , i can definitely relate . 
   so you really want to be really good in getting investors . 
  you nailed it !, 
  that 's why the us is better at consumer level technology . 
  they have investors . 
  in europe , we have governments . 
  what do you mean by `` everything '' ? 
  one wikileaks document mentions a disgruntled german employee complaining about french espionage . 
  that 's it . 
  according to this one document , france is a big espionage country . 
  not necessarily dangerous . 
  some chemicals used in weapons are extremely flammable . 
  others are only working in combination of 2 chemicals , probably stored in different areas . 
  it smells like a girl with psychological troubles , who could have lied , could have said the truth , nobody knows . 
  i would just ignore the story and see what the police/justice inquiry finds out . 
  any kind of conclusions one can draw from the few `` facts '' that journalists come out with will most certainly be erroneous . 
  one step at a time !, 
  and tax rebates . 
  i agree with you , but to be fair , the protests were mostly about adoption by gay couples . 
  you do n't need to be engaged to get married . 
  i do n't think the statistics you propose would work . 
  i believe the recent [ post ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1l3al6/exclusive_cia_files_prove_america_helped_saddam/ ) on / r/worldnews was about the us helping saddam hussein make chemical weapons !, 
  if the us had done nothing , it would probably have been much better . 
   if we do n't act we will be hated . 
  i do n't think so . 
  this is often said , but i do n't see any basis for it . 
  what about czechoslovakia , yugoslavia , the ussr in recent memory ? 
  yes , france is definitely lacking heritage sites . 
  it makes much more sense , obviously , to somehow give one family a god given right to lead a country . 
  i hope the arab springs end up turning their countries in democratic and tolerant states , like france is now . 
  best decision our ancestors ever made !, 
  do we really need to care about royal families , justin bieber or lady gaga ? 
  this is not the france your prejudices told you it should be !, 
  agreed . 
  even the question to christians only . 
  our christians are less christian than others . 
  that 's not mixing faucets by definition . 
  i have travelled a fair bit and i have only seen separate taps in the uk and ireland . 
  a french president ( chirac ) said finland had the worst food in europe . 
  i have no idea if it 's true or not . 
  what sarkozy did is put the presidential salary to the same level as it was before , by removing the hidden cash that was traditionally given .

  congratulations , you could n't get it more wrong . 
  what is his homophobic history ? 
  well she 's a nationalist , so her whole rethoric on leaving the eu is an important part of her `` program '' , but i 'd say her stance on immigration is what gets her the most votes . 
  to be fair i do n't think their respective positions on the eu will be the decisive factor in the election . 
  depends what left , socialist yes , but extreme-left is more anti-eu ( for different reasons than marine le pen though ) . 
  cut the funding of planned parenthood is marion mar\u00e9chal-le pen 's idea , not marine le pen . 
  she 's not against gay marriage , she did n't even go to the protests . 
  and where the hell did you see she wanted to repell the law on abortion ? 
  that 's pure bullshit . 
  i mean , [ 32,45 % of gay married couples vote fn ] ( http://leplus.nouvelobs.com/contribution/1505215-marine-le-pen-le-fn-et-l-homosexualite-un-double-visage-revelateur-d-un-parti-divise.html ) , the number 2 of the party ( philippot ) is gay . 
  i 'm not an fn supporter at all , but this kind of crap is what allow them to raise , they 're saying enough bullshit you can attack them on , stop inventing stuff . 
  he also said turkey does n't need the eu and that it should join the shanghai five . 
  honestly he just looks like an angry kid who did n't get his candy . 
  i disagree with some of them , have some heated debates with some of them , but i do n't dislike them because they 're english . 
  nothing more stupid than hating people because of where they 're from . 
  i do n't know about pensions so i ca n't speak about that . 
  [ here is an article explaining the eu law . 
  ] ( http://www.libreassurancemaladie.com/index.php?f=la_belle_histoire ) it 's how it happened in france but i think belgium did roughly the same . 
   in belgium we dont have that choice , you have to pay into the public system and you can get some additional private insurance but there is no option not paying into the public system you do have the choice , it 's eu law . 
  but belgium , just like france , ignores the eu and does everything it can to stop people from going private .

  man that 's impressive . 
  how could france , germany or the uk not be impressed by that . 
   latin american countries need plenty of money for travel costs in order to arrive in europe , thus they get visa-free travel because the chances of someone coming over and overstaying their welcome are slim . 
  completely ignoring the +1.5 million migrants who flooded europe the past 2 years , each of them spending between 5 000-10 000 $ to reach it . 
  money is not the reason at all why we do n't deliver visas easily to every country . 
  a flight from latin america to europe is easy to get at 400 $ .

  i meant when he got elected in 2007 , i thought this was obvious . 
  do you remember anything about it ? 
  [ the ministry of immigration , integration and national identity he created does n't ring a bell ? 
  ] ( https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/minist%c3%a8re_de_l'immigration,_de_l'int%c3%a9gration,_de_l'identit%c3%a9_nationale_et_du_d%c3%a9veloppement_solidaire ) i mean , a fucking `` national identity '' ministry man ... sarkozy is so hated now what he 's saying does n't matter anymore . 
  but fillon and le pen , who most likely are going to be on the second round , talk a lot about `` french identity '' and it 's mostly why they will be in the second turn . 
   poor and unemployed people usually do n't vote for strong neo-liberals and people that are well-off usually do n't vote for socialists . 
  they do it all the time , that 's why we have the leaders we do in europe or the us . 
  otherwise the communist party or extreme-left parties would be huge and the choice would n't be between a millionaire like clinton and a billionaire like trump , and guys like sarkozy or berlusconi would have never been elected . 
  it has never been and never will . 
  at most people check if their taxes are gon na get higher with x candidate or go down with y candidate . 
  i mean , you think sarkozy was elected on an economic program or on a `` french identity restored '' program ? 
  same question for hollande , do you think people saw someone that put the economy back on tracks or someone who was just not sarkozy ? 
  most voters do n't know shit about economics . 
  at best they have a poor understanding of basic concepts like me , but that 's pretty much it . 
  but they will talk endlessly about societal topics like religion or security . 
  this election wo n't be much about economics . 
  i love my nokia . 
  at the last minute no , according to electoral results on the other hand all the fucking time . 
  for those who might not understand , fillon is called the `` french thatcher '' because of his program . 
  mmmmh ok seems like the article i based my opinion on was incomplete and you 're correct . 
  so adoption is not ban but gay couples will only have access to `` simple adoption '' which is not a full adoption . 
  i stand corrected and it 's a very dumb view imo . 
  good point you 're correct , he 's in favour of `` simple adoption '' by gay parents , meaning for example 2 dads can adopt a child , they will be the legal parents , but not recognised as the biological parents . 
  it 's still not a ban of adoption at all . 
   being anti gay adoption does n't exactly rank him in the same crazy tier as pis . 
  just to be precise , he 's not anti-gay adoption , he 's against assisted reproductive technology for gay couples and surrogate motherhood which is already illegal for straight couples . 
  regular adoption will still be legal for married gay couples , i do n't even know how that can be compared to pis . 
  well , i know actually , the word `` restreindre '' in the french article linked , which means `` restrains '' or `` limit '' , got translated to `` ban '' . 
  politico being politico . 
   reminds me of anti-french americans before the iraq invasion . 
  they dumped expensive wine into the gutters and wanted to rename french fries into freedom fries . 
  i really like the answer someone from our ambassy gave when asked what she thought about renaming french fries `` freedom fries '' . 
  after saying that french fries were from belgium anyway , she said :  we are at a very serious moment dealing with very serious issues , and we are not focusing on the name you give to potatoes . 
  this `` movement '' could n't look more childish and ridiculous after that .

  oh good point i have n't thought about that one , i think home alone ** and ** dancing with wolves being released in 1990 explains the 1991 record . 
  kevin costner is responsible for that .

  i do n't see what sovereignty has to do with not allowing women to study but ok . 
  the fact is marie sk\u0142adowska-curie had to leave poland that she loved dearly to pursue her studies abroad because it was a backward country on that matter . 
  a genius that would have ended up being a maid if she had stayed . 
  blaming russia for it is quite ridiculous , unless you can find something on russia banning polish women to study certain fields and poles trying to actively change that . 
  but i doubt very much you 'll find anything on it . 
  i think you mean stupid poles who did n't allow women to study . 
  how do you take a rational decision then ? 
  i did n't say we were more corrupt than russia , i said we were more corrupt than what this map says . 
  problem with this kind of study is it 's only an indicator of `` basic '' corruption , like having to bribe the cops after getting pulled over . 
  but it does n't take into account the public servant who grants a public contract to his friend , or the lobbyist transfering money on the bank account of a politician in the bahamas . 
  we in western europe are much more corrupt than it appears on this map . 
  this conversation is very confusing . 
   yes you can not be tried if your country has not ratified the treaty . 
  this is definitly not ideal . 
  but how else do you want to do it ? 
  you can not force other countries to give up their juridical sovereignity . 
  of course , but the fact that a country like the us refused to sign the treaty and even passed a bill that allow them [ to fucking invade the netherlands if an american ends up being tried by the icc ] ( https://www.hrw.org/news/2002/08/03/us-hague-invasion-act-becomes-law ) does n't exactly entice third-world dictators to join it . 
  and as we see it , it 's a failure that 'll end up judging the next potential genocidal swedish dictator because only european democracies will be part of the treaty . 
  not sure they 'll have much work .

  is nudity that bad ? 
  the pride parade is also an attack on all those puritan views . 
  if you are really inconvenienced , you just need to move along . 
  it would be homophobic if you do n't mind naked ladies being on giant billboards though . 
  it can be argued that foreign aid is a defense issue as well ( the marshall plan was ) . 
  the us have some legitimate criticism to make about eu defense spending . 
  but threats and insults are not serving his point . 
  this is why europeans feel the need to point out where the us is failing . 
  but bill gates is transnational even if it is based in the us . 
  i 'm sure at least a third of their donors are not from the us . 
  the us can not claim all the spending made by american foundations . 
  we have been doing this for two centuries in the l\u00e9gion etrang\u00e8re and i do n't think there is a language requirement . 
  i 'm pretty sure that we are already taking many of the foreigners interested with military life and a path to life in europe . 
  ok so itt , people are uncomfortable with pride parades . 
  many lgbt are uncomfortable with pride parades as well . 
  but i think they do not understand why it is this way . 
  pride parade is not meant to normalize lgbt people , or to appeal to straight people , or to legitimize the community . 
  it 's a protest against the statu quo and it is meant to be somewhat shoking . 
  it 's also a celebration of the excentric personalities who created the movement and fought for the right to everyone to be themselves . 
  because the gays who lived discretely and who were conforming did nothing for their rights for the longest time . 
  those who threw the first stone at discrimination were the personalities that were so excentric they could n't possibly conform to the norm . 
  at stonewall , they were cross-dressing and transvestite living an obscene nightlife . 
  but it is thanks to them that i can live quietly my gay quiet and conforming life . 
  even though i 'm not `` fabulous '' , i think pride should remain outrageous even when we are close to equality to celebrate those who fought for our rights . 
  hey !, 
  that 's france 's idea !, 
  i guess that 's french humor then because highly agitated replies are part of the fun for me , as long as you have some self-depreciating humor . 
  i know it 's just a cultural divide . 
  but in my feels , maternity leave or single payer healthcare are just common sense and completely basic . 
  similarly you might find our hate speech and lack of self-defense laws to be completely immoral would n't want to share the title `` land of the free '' with us . 
  you may have described brits , french and spaniards here . 
  the rest of europe is very aware of their weaknesses and do n't live by the legacy of any great empire . 
  every time someone bring up european healthcare , or paid leave , or any basic social security on reddit . 
  there 's a bunch of triggered americans explaining to us that our system is failing and they talk about how we live without freedom and some nonsense . 
  there are also quite a lot of americans jumping on the america-bashing train admiring europe to be fair . 
  this does not come from a place of insecurity . 
  we do it because it 's so easy to troll americans imo . 
  there are quite insecure because of their superiority complex.it 's so hard for them to handle the fact they can not be the best at everything . 
  you can have california up from the bay . 
  the rest should go back to spain . 
  ok you have a point but if we go back to the original argument , you concede that borders were irrelevant for the vast majority of commoners in the middle ages . 
  the delimitations were about the repartition of resources for the elite , they had no lasting influence on the identity of people living in those territory . 
  this came later and it reached its peak when millions of people fought for a few kilometers of territory for their country in wwi . 
  but at the time , instead of asking the international community to support yugoslavia in the peacekeeping effort before a global referendum could be hold . 
  serbia declared independance first and then began ethnic cleansing in neighboring countries which effectively turned every countries against them . 
  because serbia committed war crimes , they lost all claims on neighboring countries in the eyes of the international community . 
  it 's quite similar to the way germany shrunk in 1945 . 
  during most of european history , `` national '' borders delimited personal possession of an elite . 
  the borders of france , hungary or sweden have changed every decade because of marriages , purchases and fight between cousins . 
  free folks were able to freely travel across those territories if they payed some fee or some kind of tariff . 
  the border were n't the defining feature of a territory , the focus was the centers of power . 
  they were very far from the idea of eternal and sacred border we began to embrace in the 19th century .

  but the data is enough for medical associations to prescribe surgery in association with therapy . 
  they can be unsatisfied by the choice of the other voters . 
  they are legitimate to be outraged that nearly half of the country is complacent about corruption . 
  but i found it sad that they wo n't continue to try to vote for the lesser of two evils ( there is always one ) . 
  but i understand some do n't want to give legitimity to someone they despise even if the alternative is worse . 
  it 's a different opinion about how democracy is supposed to work . 
  it 's sad that you think nothing can ever change your mind and that if someone criticizes you ideas he is criticizing yourself . 
  but that explains why so many people think they are specifically insulted when someone talks about religion or social issues . 
  the fact are still there . 
  gender , sexual orientation and race are determined at birth and people can not quit them . 
  religion or political leaning however are not something that naturally arise when you are a teenager , neither are they set in stones . 
  and there are countless examples of conversion . 
  this is reasonable ground to say that your ideas are separate from the idea of self imo , even if they are useful to build your identity . 
  i would argue that this traditional idea of marriage has already been abandonned when we decided that it was illegal to force someone to marry someone else or to remain in the marriage . 
  it 's also illegal to marry someone just to get his nationality for instance . 
  those are the laws that redefined traditional marriage in the 20th century . 
  gay marriage is simply the corollary of those changes . 
  abnormal is not a mental disease . 
  their suicide rate is higher before surgery than after , even if it remains higher than the general population . 
  sex reassignment is the medically prescribed help they need . 
  validation further lowers their suicide rate . 
  i think you did n't know people with gender dysphoria were called transgender even when they did n't take any hormon nor perform any surgery . 
  because a philosophical * stance * is something that can change , something you believe in , something you choose . 
  if it 's you race or your gender , it 's the core of the your identity .

  the counterpart to murica is yurop, 
  actually there was a huge backlash when sarkozy suggested we should teach the benefits of colonialism . 
  nowadays , colonialism is described as unambiguously bad in history class . 
  it has not been politically correct to suggest colonialism has been beneficial for the locals for fifteen years in france . 
  but there have been some resistance among the grassroot supporters of the conservative right . 
  when you are aware of this context , this reaction is even more surprising . 
  so you are comparing studies which proved causation to a correlation you pulled out of your ass ?

  * `` there are no snakes in ireland '' * is also [ a short story by the english writer frederick forsyth .

  i do n't know what you 're trying to say , i agree with you all along , my point was just that rewriting history with `` ifs '' is a bit pointless . 
  yeah i know , and if de gaulle had been in charge since the beginning we would have won the war blablabla . 
  we have a saying in french : `` with `` ifs '' we could fit paris in a bottle '' . 
  again , that 's easy to rewrite history ... 
  there is already strong cooperation between british and french armies . 
  we 're already heading towards a french-british army . 
  i do n't think france should lead or the british lead the navy , that should simply be a joined command , with other countries contributing depending on their capabilities . 
  interesting , i must say that i did n't think that was anywhere representative of german 's public opinion , just thought that in this context that was quite ludicrous to make such a claim . 
  clearly , i ca n't get my head around this . 
   `` german security policy has relevance -- also far beyond our country , '' the paper states . 
  `` germany is willing to join early , decisively and substantially as a driving force in international debates ... to ** take responsibility and assume leadership '' . 
  ** i find this incredibly arrogant to claim germany should take responsability and lead an eu army . 
  france and the uk have been by far the main military powers , building their power over decades , have nuclear capability , very active abroad but germany , that reluctantly gave a minor contribution in all the last conflicts and literally no projection power would lead ?!!!, 
  let 's talk about it again in a few decades . 
  it 's just not the same , if the us withdraws from nato there is no nato anymore . 
   a lot of the question is why france did nothing beside declaring till the invasion of france as it 's considered a bad decision for france too . 
  well there are not a lot of questions , the french general staff was convinced the maginot line will keep us safe and did n't want to invade germany because they feared this would end up in trenches for years like wwi . 
  it was obviously a major mistake , but hey it 's easy to rewrite history decades later . 
  exactly , they wonder `` why '' we 're important , suggesting they think otherwise ... 
   surely , the real problem is that most people are n't keen on paying to get their news , therefore newspapers just have the ads revenues which can be enough to subscribe to big agencies reports , but not enough to pay proper journalists . 
  people do n't seem to understand that `` free '' can not possibly means `` quality '' . 
  things are changing slowly though , and people realize slowly that it might worth it to pay a few bucks to have quality news cf. 
  just a little thing , this is n't a copy-pasta , yahoo and other media pay a shitload of money to the afp ( and other big agencies like reuters ) to be able to publish their reports . 
  that 's a reason why journalism sucks today , everybody is buying and publishing the same articles from press agencies and smaller media outlets just basically rewrite them because they do n't have the budget to afford them . 
  i had to do it for a small website , and believe me it sucks for everybody . 
  if a website just did a copy-pasta of an afp report without paying they would basically shut down the next day . 
   understand that to get us ever on board it is not enough to say `` yeah it will be defensive in nature '' . 
  we will need black on white exact treaties and decisions . 
  iron tight ones . 
   so yeah , we will need a new definition , a long and exact one in a treaty , with your seals and head of states signature under it . 
  i understand that , and it 's a perfectly reasonable demand . 
  it 's obvious to me that an eu army would have a very strict definition of its mission , signed and ratified by all members . 
  because an eu army would be there to defend the integrity of the eu territory , period . 
  france 's foreign policy is irrelevant in this . 
  or do you think we would go to slovakia or finland and start kidnapping kids to drop them in irak to fight ? 
  so you think an eu army would have the neocon bush mentality ? 
  do you realise how hated this kind of vision of the world is among eu countries ? 
  an eu army would be defensive as it would defend the sovereignty of the eu territory , so no member state would ever experience something like crimea . 
  period . 
  if an eu army is created , there is absolutely no way it could function beyond a defensive mission . 
  most countries would never agree to an intervention in foreign countries , the idea is just getting back our sovereignty from nato and be able to defend ourselves . 
   aggressive wars are frequently painted as defensive . 
  such as ? 
  so because bush 's neoconservative madness an eu army will also make up a new definition of `` defence '' and start invading foreign countries after lying at the un with fake reports ? 
  nice example you took by the way , a war opposed by germany and france , the 2 members that would be the largest contributors of an eu army . 
   i do n't trust german/austrian/scandinavians politicians to be brave enough to quickly allow an intervention or a military operation . 
  they come from countries in which the political climate opposes foreign military interventions . 
  an eu army would be defensive . 
  and fyi , germany decided in january 2016 to send 650 soldiers in mali for peacekeeping missions . 
   if all of europe had had a say in the iraq war , we would have had to invade their country as well . 
  with germany and france opposing it ? 
  because we both opposed it . 
  and without france and germany , an eu army would do nothing . 
  yes , an eu army would have very strict prerogatives . 
  it would be a completely defensive one . 
   i also think a lot of people are overestimating the amount of power the president has . 
  and i think you underestimate the influence of your president in your country 's image abroad . 
  for the next four years at least , the image of your country will be damaged like never before . 
  because if there is one power a us president has , it 's on foreign policy . 
  and most people do n't care about internal us politics , they care about what you do in other countries . 
  this is what they will remember from trump . 
   and what can the parlament do , besides say no ? 
  again it can not set any tone ... 
  i 'll let you learn what an amendment is . 
   have you heard of separation of powers though ? 
  means different bodies have different powers . 
  yes , one has the power to make the unsername low_discrepancy illegal , the other can submit the bill that make it illegal . 
  i 'm sure you 'll vote in the presidential election thinking you elect your king . 
  jospin , a socialist , became premier ministre because without the parliament , the president has no power . 
  i do n't have to explain anything else . 
   again 90 % of the laws are n't initiated by the parliament . 
  the govt sets the tone on how the country will be run in the next 5 years . 
  and if the government does n't have the majority , it ca n't do anything . 
  the government can try to set the tone , but if it 's not followed by the parliament it 's done . 
  because parliament has far more power than the president , countries where it 's the opposite are called dictatorship , you might have heard of it . 
   they basically just approve or disprove . 
  who sets the budgets ? 
  who sets the main goals ? 
   parliament just gives the go ahead . 
  mps do n't just give `` the go ahead '' , by having the power to approve it they have the real power . 
  the government can not set a budget that does n't satisfy mps , they have to comply by what they want or not . 
  it 's like saying the intern who wrote a report for the ceo has the real power , because the ceo only approves or disproves it . 
  sounds ridiculous right ? 
   yes when is vastly more important and it 'll span decades into the future of the country . 
   the other we do every 5 years , twice . 
  i 'm not sure i understood you . 
   that 's normal . 
  it 's the second most important election . 
  popularity drops off . 
  election fatigue sets in .

   his premiership you know holland is n't prime minister ? 
  say what you want about the man 's domestic policies , but he 's been doing a pretty good job on the international stage . 
  wait , maybe it 's number of balistic missiles and not number of warheads . 
  you mean dwayne, 
   assuming no nukes also assuming yes nukes , france alone has more nukes than russia . 
  yes !, 
  i remember now !, 
  ah , highschool ... 
  thank you . 
  i used to also be able to say `` i 'm high '' which i think meant i 'm on a cloud or something , but i forgot, 
  that 's what a quick google search revealed , yeah , i was expecting something more ... real ? 
  less made up ? 
   bullet has someones name on it , explosive ordinance is for whom it may concern i 'm stealing this, 
   officially that 's the important word in that sentence . 
  please post a source about those orders , i want to read more about it . 
   so stupid . 
   portugal having roads i mean where else are they going to drive the ox-carts ? 
  maybe this could be the start of a life long friendship , like dale zelko and zoltan dani ? 
   all my grand ^ 5 - parents are verifiably french , except one who is swiss - nobody is perfect - . 
  well my grand ^ 6 parents are french , and none of them are swiss  my last name has a gallic root while also being the most french name you can ever devise . 
  my last name is also the name of a village in france that also happens to have a prehistoric cave painting site . 
  so my ancestors lived in france in prehistoric times . 
   i have an ancestor who at the age of 6 was spitting in the soup that was meant for the occupying prussian soldiers . 
  i have an ancestors who was pissing in the prussian 's soup at 5 . 
   i have a pristine participation record in voting . 
  i got so many stamps on my voter 's card i can redeem it for a free kebab . 
   i live in paris . 
  so you 're not french then , t\u00eate de veau . 
  so , yeah , checkmate . 
  hint : the most expensive parts of a prison are n't the barbells and video games either . 
  the tvs and mattresses are n't the most expensive parts in a prison you know . 
  i 'm not saying it 's right , i 'm just saying that 's why it 's done . 
  because jails are expensive and overcrowded . 
   who wants virgins ? 
  i mean you 've got eternity to break them in . 
   like an eternity of watching netflix on the sofa while eating a nice sausage pizza and some cheetos and a big glass of schweppes . 
  anything but 72 friggin ' virgins . 
  to be fair those are not mutually exclusive . 
   isnt this a myth ? 
  religion ? 
  yes . 
  i do n't think the people who commit terrorist acts motivated by islam are aware of that fact . 
  yes , we were talking about marion . 
  i mean how else do you explain angela , right ? 
  oh sure her name plays a huge role in the whole thing . 
  i just think it 's a bit weird to dismiss everything she does because she 's pretty . 
  just because she 's the youngest does n't mean the only value she has is being pretty . 
   had she been a nerdy looking mid-twenty man with the same opinions , she would n't be anywhere near a seat in parliament , and those subs would n't have noticed her at all . 
  that 's kinda sexist dude, 
  i mean she kind of is , no homo . 
  no more tears , only dreams now . 
  are you really surprised , coming form someone who ca n't spell `` annex '' ? 
   as close as we can get to our old guillotine-days . 
  * for now *, 
   however i do have an unusually well developed talent stack , coupled with strong ethics . 
  dude this is n't an interview . 
   carr\u00e8e you tried :-), 
   they really need to work on a solid plan b. 
  why do you think it is they are buying companies and football teams abroad , while building luxury hotels and resorts in their countries , as well as massive airports to make themselves into a transportation hub between europe and asia ? 
  they 're not stupid , they have a plan b. 
  or about minitel really makes you think does n't it, 
  i do n't know how i can explain it better than in my first post frankly, 
  you have n't mentioned the minitel though . 
  i 'm not surprised . 
  us military : rekt minitel : incarnation of french overwhelming technological superiority, 
   frau angie mutti merkel for you, 
   bullshit really interesting article , thanks for sharing . 
  and handsome . 
   you sound like trump . 
  except it 's easier to forgive his grammar because english is n't his first language . 
  forgiving trump 's though ... 
   which air superiority fighter are you going to use to compete with mig35s ? 
  how are you going to counter long range buk and s400 missile systems ? 
  rafale , son  how are you going to stop the huge armoured/mechanised numerical advantage the russians have if you ca n't maintain total air supremacy ? 
  leclerc , son  how are you going to gain the advantage in electronic warfare without an awac fleet to speak of ? 
  minitel , son . 
  baiser is a noun , that means `` kiss '' . 
  baiser on the other hand , is a verb , that means `` to fuck '' . 
  you see it 's all about context here . 
  no it 's definitely illegal . 
  i think the niquab law was only the logical continuation of the previous laws that existed , and that were targeting christians . 
  you 're not allowed to wear a cross necklace , or a shirt that says `` i love jesus '' in a public school , or public building , for instance . 
  this has been part of the french identity since the r\u00e9volution , and i like it that way . 
  i think it was only fair that the law was updated to adapt to the new religions that exist on our territory . 
  and i do n't think the problem is with muslims not feeling accepted . 
  they 're citizens like everyone else . 
  the problem is with the mentality that the republic should cater to the needs and wants of their religion , when the french tradition on the matter always was '' ** worship whoever you want , as long as you do it behind closed doors and shut the fuck up about it ** '' . 
  this is a fundamental problem , but as i said before , it 's only a matter of time before it solves itself . 
   not so sure i agree . 
  after all , you did for example ban the niquab . 
  if anything , your politicians have more balls in these issues than most other europeans . 
  good point . 
  sarkosy 's presidency was mixed on this issue . 
  he did do the whole niquab thing ( which officially has nothing to do with islam , the law is about concealing your face in public and while driving ) , but he also appointed someone to represent the muslims of france in front of the government , which i do n't think we needed . 
  they 're citizens like everyone else , they have senators , mayors , etc , to represent them , just like every other french citizen . 
  that is mainly the cause of my concern . 
  regarding your points one and two , i completely agree on that . 
  you also have to look at history to see a pretty good example of what 's happenning today . 
  christianity did n't accept to live in a secular state overnight . 
  it took century , and there were civil wars about it ( in france ) .

  they do n't really care about borders either . 
   problem # 2 : shipping costs . 
  enormous shipping costs from most of european countries uh ? 
  free or very cheap shipping is common in most online shopping . 
   and shipping was whooping 31.50 $ ( and 6.50 $ if i were in netherlands ) . 
  ok , my particular country is n't yet inside schengen change retailer , you are getting screwed over . 
   saying that immigrants need to assimilate and learn german well one does not preclude the other ; that much remains definitely true . 
  it 's best to learn the language & practices of the land you intend to live in , especially if long term . 
  erh , maybe this is a bit heavy handed . 
   any sensible leader would condition this shit with full schengen admission and dedicated funds to help with this clusterfuck . . good point . 
   one club owner increased its declared revenues by 1,500 % in may-july 2015 compared to the same period of last year , from about eur 20,000 to eur 324,000 , according to anaf . 
  haha  solved cases of small-time boutique owners such as identifying a chain of 70 companies controlled by two turkish investors which have damaged the state budget by eur 31 million since 2013 '' . 
  nice work there, 
  that definitely rings true . 
  you speak truth there friend \\* sigh *, 
  well , here 's another stat we can easily influence upon !, 
  rise the asylum acceptance rate of w&c and lower it for the others ( or even block it then allow the women to do family reunion , changing massively the demographics that come in ) . 
   the question is : why do n't they do anything at all . 
  because the troika pushed out everyone that had the courage to try anything and threathens anyone else who might have ideas . 
  the end result really is that the country is back on auto pilot , and that unless tsipras get re elected the reforms will likely never happen . 
   they can do anything they want or wish . 
  no , they ca n't . 
  anything that displease the troika will likely get them a phone call saying they 'll get worse rates , less cuts & more trouble if they do n't stop immediately . 
  i love how they put greece above china . 
  with no intended disrespect to the proud greeks , that list might be a bit propaganda or slightly biased haha, 
  well it has if you can use it to do something . 
  however if it 's just numbers on paper and do n't brings you anything , it quickly stop having meaning . 
  gold standard is a joke . 
  you ca n't buy food or oil or auto parts with gold in real life . 
  and even if you did at a ridiculous rate ( here 's a ~ ~ diamond ~ ~ gold bar for that sack of potatoes ) , it 'd be pretty quickly all gone . 
   nor what the financial backing of this new currency would be . 
  here lies the important question . 
  they lack the industry for that , and raw ressources prices are crashing . 
  their only real bet would be china chipping in , and i doubt china 'd risk a currency zone looking at how broke russia is becoming ( they would n't want their own greece ) . 
  ( for money to have value you need to be able to exchange it against something of value . 
  ressources are loosing value and russia is n't manufacturing much . 
  so what 's worth of value enough and widely avalaible to back the currenty ? 
  china do manufacture a lot but i doubt they 'd cooperate that much ), 
  well they 'll need to fix that much . 
  i hope the futur finance minister will know what he 's doing , honest ( ha ) and willing to tackle the issues . 
  because if he 's like the ones before syriza , he 'll just pocket kickbacks , send checks to germany when asked , and ignore whatever 's going on ... 
   it 's like all retarded ideologies , long abandoned by most reasonable people , are getting a revival in greece . 
  probably because all the `` sane '' ones all concluded to the same thing : extreme poverty for you , more money for foreign bankers & bond holders & other billonaire creditors '' . 
  so , unsurprizingly , greek people are looking elsewhere . 
  edit : just to be clear , during wwii while everyone in germany 's politics was looking to apply the versailles treaty , the nazi fed the population . 
  that 's why people put them in charge . 
  sure why not . 
  but most that comes here tries to go to the uk instead . 
  we 're not that popular anymore apparently \\* shrugs * ( and , really , more than anything else , we need to rebuild `` the jungle '' area in calais as a proper camp . 
  but that 's just me ), 
   that wo n't work and you know it . 
  there is no single migrant who has entered europe who will leave . 
  and lost a ton of money . 
  by putting them back in turkey they lost a lot of time & money & ca n't always do it again . 
  it sends at least a warning of not doing anything like it again . 
   do you think a single one will obey a deportation order ? 
  you ever met greek cops ? 
  i believe they wo n't really ask the detained rioters . 
  they 'll happily put them handcuffs , bring them in the first plane or safe boat , and happily drop them in the turkish airport or port . 
  i believe here it says we can deport them without warning to turkey : http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-25398872 perfect . 
  let 's arrest the rioters and send them to the refugee camps there . 
  ( sorry erdogan : / on the bright side , they 'll probably be more calm once they realize violence has only negative consequences for them ) the afghan themselves might even try to apply to iran instead : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/afghans_in_iran, 
  most of 1930 era germany really believed that they were people that `` polluted '' the genepool by being genetically corrupt . 
  now we know that has no scientifical basis , so they adapted by saying it 's foreign culture . 
  the problem being that sometime some culture are ... yes , let 's say it , lagging behind the others . 
  however while we believe we should integrate them - teach them our own culture - & limit numbers & fix the problem at the source ( ie help stopping the war or poverty ) , nazis believe we should throw them out in the sea or kill them `` just to be safe '' . 
  ( obviously i heavily disagree with that . ), 
  i do n't think he 's necessarily evil . 
  i think he hates a lot of people because he thinks they 're the one that are destroying his country . 
  and that his country 's culture is going to disappear due to it . 
  ( on my own i do suspect that society in europe is going aside because at high level everyone is stealing their own billion regularly `` but it 's just a single sand grain in the beach '' but well if everyone does it ... ), 
   gorbachev was pushing through liberalization exactly . 
  and did n't that caused that the kgb did n't wanted any of that shit so they did their own stuff in their corner without consulting him ? 
   nobody was rooting out opponents well , historically what was the soviet reaction to independancy declaration ? 
  oh yeah , sending in the tanks . 
  except since gorbatchev would n't send tanks against civilians , they had to convince him it was violent militias massacring civilians . 
   azeris were largely in favour of keeping the union until black january soviet authorities were well positionned to know how weak they were in the 90 's , and that they would n't be able to keep anything in the ussr without resorting to violence & the army if it came to independancy declarations . 
  from wikipedia : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/azerbaijan#republic_era  later in 1990 , the supreme council of the azerbaijan ssr dropped the words `` soviet socialist '' from the title , adopted the declaration of sovereignty of the azerbaijan republic and restored flag of the azerbaijan democratic republic as the state flag you do n't plot that kind of thing overnight . 
  so it 's obvious they had months or years of prep and moscow/the kgb inevitably heard about it . 
  they probably started to act that very moment . 
   and armenia itself is n't a nonfactor . 
  without russian military , armenian military strength alone is a joke , like most post soviet republics . 
  the whole thing was built to rely on russia . 
   practically every inch of azerbaijani-held territory has been cleansed of armenians . 
  it 's not much of a stretch to infer what they intended for nk . 
  i 'm not saying that did not happen . 
  i 'm saying that it 's possible that the kgb manipulated azeri extremists to do it , to have a casus belli to offer to gorbatchev to intervene . 
  remember the iraqi war how cheney 's cronies pushed `` proofs of chemical & mass destruction weapons '' on bush ' desk ? 
   they had the soviet union already , and azerbaijan was plotting to leave it . 
   azerbaijani-armenian conflict did nothing to preserve the union apart massively weakening azerbaijan that just declared independancy , put a frozen conflict in it 's border backed by russian tourists , and strengthen largely relations with it 's neighbor armenia that just gained territory , weapons , and became reliant on russia again for their own military security . 
   yes . 
  those crafty russians created debilitating unrest in their own country to root out opponents and slaughter them better ? 
  they did used the trick repeatedly in poland & the baltics to crush the maquis . 
   to retain in order to create after the collapse of their empire ( which they very much like to avoid ) a small poor statelet that they would have very , very minor influence over down the line . 
  it was obvious that the azeri were about to declare independancy . 
  much like ukraine did recently de facto . 
  the moment they do , suddenly the independant azeri 's opponents get hundreds of tanks , dozens of bm21 and even a pair of sukhois . 
  but it 's to protect ~ ~ russian ~ ~ armenian speaking minorities from genocide . 
  right . 
   because they just like conflict between ethnic groups that much .

  hell , nobody ever dared to touch their special religion laws because of that , even though they 're against the french constitution ... 
  it 's also easy to attack for his adversaries , especially if he got nothing in return . 
  they would point out his weakness to the eu , and particularly germany . 
  germany would be highlighted because they 'd keep the ecb . 
  so basically no party ever mentions that topic because it 's just too risky for them , in terms of election . 
  the only realistic way to make it change , is to make sure there 's something in return . 
  like something else in strasbourg that replaces the economic activity and prestige/influence . 
  like germany has the ecb , france had something at the time . 
  i know it does n't sound fair or whatever , but if your goal is to think about it instead of just bash the french then it makes sense . 
  personally i 'd agree that the parliament should n't be in such an influential country as france , just like the ecb should n't be in germany . 
  belgium is pretty good for that ; if they ca n't agree on a government , or even that they 're actually a country , there 's little to fear in terms of influence ... also , most of the comments here are just complains and french-bashing , honestly it 's not a really constructive or a welcoming discussion . 
  i 've never heard anyone talk about it in france . 
  either side . 
  in france , french guyana is mostly known for the rockets , and the mosquitoes . 
  the food is interesting though . 
  they 're talking voting right in the company 's board ( internal company votes by the owners to take strategy decisions ) , not for national elections . 
  i moved out at 15 as well , to study 500km away . 
  parents paid for the dorm room obviously . 
  when you see the properties of the french state for the president and institutions , you ca n't really say much about it . 
  actually that railway is a clusterfuck for time . 
  [ here 's ] ( http://dereklow.co/my-journey-across-russia-on-the-trans-siberian-railway/ ) an interesting article about the ride ; he goes about time zones around the end ( ctrl + f `` time zones '' if you 're not interested by the rest ) . 
  for arte there 's no unique original language . 
  the speakers are either french or german-speaking . 
   people 's right to self-determination except for refugees right ? 
  those ca n't choose their nationality . 
  good , you never know when those bloodthirsty bastards from south tirol will attack . 
  i assure you that i can get you french wines that are objectively terrible . 
  are we even sure it 's likely not a fake ? 
  by the way , i have joan of arc 's panties , if someone wants to make an offer . 
  the goal is to encourage people to take the bicycle instead of the car , you 're not going to achieve that by telling them they 're lazy . 
  it reminds me a lot of the verdon valley in france . 
  signal has a stronger encryption . 
  telegram has lots of critics in that regard , and snapchat is n't encrypted . 
  no the belgians would n't do that . 
  it 's those bloodthirsty luxembourgers i 'm wary about . 
  yes , so it 's not `` multiculturalism '' which is always a problem . 
  so if i , as a french ( currently ) , permanently move to germany for instance , it 's wrong to continue cooking blanquette and teach my kids how to speak french ? 
  a direct high-speed line under the alps would be significantly different than the current frejus tunnel , even if it gets reworked . 
  ah ok , thanks . 
  i thought that gibraltar was a crown dependency , not a part of the uk ? 
  they probably have no idea what they 'd do yet , since it would depend on many unknowns . 
  so they do n't want to make definitive commitments one way or the other . 
  but at the same time they want to make statements supporting staying in since they see brexit as a high business risk . 
  non-eu migrants are already controlled by westminster . 
  still can not understand why france is blamed for the camps . 
  with some friends we drove from budapest to the uk once . 
  we went through hungary , slovakia , czech republic , germany , the netherlands , belgium , and france without a single id check . 
  the only check was to cross the channel to get to the uk . 
  they would integrate well with british politicians it seems . 
  france 's integration policies have nothing to do with illegal migrants . 
  france did n't invite them . 
   no-one is going to carry them if they face fines for some reason i doubt the ferry companies have the means to check properly all the lorries thoroughly . 
  but let 's try , why not ? 
   both of those things they could do now , but do n't seem to be doing in large numbers no they ca n't . 
  they ca n't approach the ferries due to the touquet agreement application ( by the french forces ) , and the french coast guard and police prevents them from crossing with their own boats . 
   and from the uks point of view , france should really do something about the situation whereby they facilitate easy movement from outside of the eu , to the uk border without sensible checks in place the difference is that the uk can complain all they want , they ca n't do anything about the controls that schengen countries put in place . 
  however , france has total control of the controls that happen in calais and can unilaterally decide to stop it . 
  i agree . 
  i like to uk too , i even studied there . 
  but here the french government is just reminding the uk that they can not pretend it 's not a shared problem , and that france does have enough leverage for future negotiations . 
  it 's not going to be purely one-sided . 
  most of the migrants would then be squatting in the pre-check zone of dover , or would have jumped overboard and swam ashore , or would have gotten caught in shitty boats by the british coast guard . 
  in all those cases , the british would have to deal with them then . 
  globally it 's certainly not better , but if our countries stop playing ball together , from france 's point of view only it can be quite tempting to try . 
  given the pain in the ass that this is to manage , it 's understandable that france could consider ditching that agreement and accept the slowness of traffic instead . 
   there would be a conversation between relevant departments of both countries to agree a way of returning those declined refugees to country they entered from ok . 
  so now the french officials disagree . 
  what now ? 
  cool . 
  then let 's get rid of all this cost and mess already . 
  stop the agreement , stop the controls , let the carriers do it . 
  because the alternative would be to have the border check in the uk , at no cost for france . 
  france can pull out of the touquet agreement as it wants . 
  it 's totally in its power . 
  very well , so no issue there . 
  we could stop all this cost and the agreement and remove the controls . 
  the carriers will take care of it . 
  deal . 
  very well , so no issue here . 
  we can stop the agreement and controls , and let the carriers take care of it . 
  and they 'd be refused entry in france and sent back from where they came from , dover . 
  in practice you 'd get half the migrants squatting the pre-check zone of dover , and the other half jumping out of the ship before the harbour , swimming ashore , and getting caught for the british police to deal with . 
  sure , but it is entirely france 's choice to stop that , let you keep your millions and stop the controls in calais . 
  but then france could also send your ferry right back . 
  if france receives a ferry full of migrants coming from a first world country like the uk it would be perfectly legal to send them right back . 
  it sounds like you 're talking about the uk . 
   to france . 
  the carrier is responsible for their return but then french border control in calais could refuse them entry on french territory , fine the carrier and make him send them back to their departure point , the uk . 
  yes , i can see the uk agreeing to pay for a migrants prison in france ... 
   the uk could always check visas/passports on the vessels and trains before they leave france no they could n't . 
  they do not have sovereignty in french territory so the british border control could n't happen there without an agreement from the french . 
  also it does n't happen automatically in airports either . 
  unless an agreement is signed , border control happens at the destination , not the departure . 
  airlines can choose to check at the departure ( and do to avoid fees ) , but that 's a decision by a private company , not an obligation for the country . 
   you should protect your own regardless of the lack of realism of such statement , that 's not up the the british to comment on this . 
   because our nations are friends . 
  but ultimately it is not our problem . 
  no , not because we are friends , simply because france could choose unilaterally to let the entire problem shift to the uk . 
  therefore the uk proposes to pay for a good part of it to avoid such decision . 
  nobody said such thing , the minister said they could stop preventing them to try .

  also , the vichy government was a puppet of nazi germany created from what remained after france 's defeat . 
  though many people in vichy were fascists and supported the deportation and even sometimes the extermination of the jews and went ever further than what the germans asked , presenting the vichy government as a 100 % legitimate government is ridiculous . 
   victimism 101 . 
  `` i 'm losing an argument , i better call the other person offensive , racist and xenophobic . '', 
  that the joke is xenophobic and in poor taste is not really disputable you know , it 's the case for many jokes , but you ca n't just claim it 's not offensive or xenophobic , because it is . 
   americans did n't surrender and collaborate with the nazis . 
  changing the subject because you could n't find an other answer that `` well , we 're better than you !!! '', 
   in a way , france is actually responsible for the millions of jews killed by the nazis as well , so be happy that the joke is only about surrender . 
  wait , france loses against germany , is forced into collaboration , and as such is responsible for germany 's actions ? 
  wtf ? 
   in case of argument , call the other party racist , xenophobic or misogynistic . 
  are you dense , or do you not realize that a joke that mocks an entire country based on one particular , dramatic event , is xenophobic ? 
  oh wait , you also do n't realize that treating people who died fighting of cowards is offensive ... 
  yeah , as i said , before , treating soldiers who died fighting for their country of cowards is n't offensive at all . 
  i wonder what americans might think if foreign people went to american cemeteries and started treating all soldiers buried there of cowards because the us were forced to retreat from vietnam . 
   grow up . 
  i 'm not the one making xenophobic jokes based on stupid stereotypes . 
  or maybe , you know , i just care about facts and not spitting on the grave of soldiers who died for their country . 
   it does n't make fun of the victims yes , it does , it presents the soldiers who fought and died as cowards , at best , or denies their existence as the joke often implies france surrendered without a fight despite losing more than 100 000 soldiers in just 6 weeks during the battle of france in ww2 , at worst . 
  also , it ignores pretty much all of french military history and just focuses on one bad defeat and presents it as a generality for no other reason than to bash france . 
  i wo n't even bother responding to the last part of your comment . 
  really , only the french are offended by jokes made about them ? 
  are you actually serious ? 
  yes , i mean , calling all french people cowards and losers even though the country won the majority of its wars and lost approximately 2 million soldiers in various wars just in the last century , with every french family having a relative that either was killed or had to go to war , is definitely not offensive at all . 
  hell , it 's almost a compliment !, 
   learn to take a joke dude , on the english-speaking internet there is a french surrender joke litteraly every goddamn time france is mentioned in any way , 95 % of the times by americans . 
  considering the politics behind this ultra-stupid , very offensive joke , it 's possible to sometimes make a comment about its use when it comes from people from cultures where the popularity of this joke makes no sense without being necessarily butthurt or lacking a sense of humor . 
  this is n't polandball . 
   somehow only french people are constantly offended ... nice generalization , i 'm pretty sure most french redditors do n't really care , and i 'm not really offended either , nordics bashing france just seems to come out of nowhere and i 'd like to understand . 
   nordic not scandinavian heh , sorry :(  secondly he is a fin , they are like this to everyone . 
  still does n't explain the use of an already bogus stereotype which is also almost exclusively anglo-american . 
   thirdly it is pretty obnoxious of you to refer to scandinavians as if it is as unified as uk and not separate countries i never said that nor implied it , i as well as many french redditors just noticed a lot of french surrender jokes coming from redditors with swedish , norvegian or finnish flairs in the last few years , which seems pretty weird to us . 
  what 's up with scandinavian people making french surrender jokes ? 
  like , we have pretty much no history of either hatred or love , nor of much conflict , with you , and you 're really not ones to talk considering your performances ( if there was even one depending of which scandinavian country we 're talking about ) against germany in ww2 ... edit : i 'm not being aggressive , i just do n't understand , french surrender jokes are already painfully bad and annoying considering their inaccuracy when they come from british or american people , but scandinavians mocking france 's military might makes no sense at all , it seems to come out of nowhere . 
  i assume it 's due to the fact so many scandinavian people are fluent in english and as such are highly exposed to anglo-american culture . 
  plus , the cit\u00e9 radieuse is a great building . 
  itt : people who greatly exaggerate le corbisier 's role in the use of `` commie blocks '' and widely misunderstand his intentions . 
   france treats it 's poor and underpriviliged citizens like shit . 
  relatively true , but france is also one of the countries in the world who cares the most about the poor and the underprivileged , so that 's not the only reason , and your post exaggerates greatly . 
  the british army neither invented guerilla warfare , which had existed for a while and in the peninsula war was actually used by the spanish , nor was more innovative . 
  the french revolutionary army was by far the most innovative of the times and it 's the one that influenced all the others for the decades to come . 
  the greatest military minds , from generals to theorists like clausewitz for example , spent the following decades studying the french army and napoleon 's war tactics and using them as the basis to develop their own armies . 
  to claim the british army was more innovative is simply incredibly wrong . 
  edit : i repeat , considering i 'm being downvoted , the early 1800 's was the time the french army kept bitch slapping all of the armies of continental europe despite being often outnumbered and having no particular technological advantage . 
  the fact that the french revolutionary army led by napoleon fucking bonaparte was the most innovative of the era is n't really open to debate . 
   i would call the ump far-right most french people would n't . 
   centre right means they inhabit the centre of the right wing . 
  no , it means the party 's influence and ideology stretches from the center to the right . 
  claim to not care about france . 
  brag about their victories against the french and bash the hell out of france in their media constantly . 
  the results for france , germany , england and scotland seem a little stereotypical . 
  just a little , 
   see , that 's exactly the problem . 
  once you start declaring something as basic as fried meat with fried potatoes as a national dish you can then apply that same scope to anything else . 
  yeah , except no , i 'm not talking out of my ass here , ask any one who knows anything about cuisine or any chef about steak with fries and he 'll tell you it 's a classic french dish , and i only mentionned that one because it 's the most outrageous example ( i myself was pretty sure it was universal until i heard from a british chef that steak with fries is originally a french dish ) , but there are plenty others . 
  as for the five mother sauce , i 'm afraid this one is totally undeniable and one of the main arguments for the stupidly enormous influence of french cuisine . 
   the only thing french cuisine really did was codify certain recipes and cooking techniques . 
  i do n't really understand why you do n't want to give credit to french cuisine anyway , you sure do n't have any source backing you up . 
  also , you speak as if i was a fanatic but my original comment was in response to a negative comment about french cuisine that i found ignorant , not a random declaration of superiority . 
  i personally consider italian cuisine on par with french one ( edit  like most french people commenting here . 
   you claim steaks with fries is french ? 
  yes !, 
  steak with fries is a classic french dish . 
  look it up . 
   anything with sauce too ? 
  not anything , but a huge part , yes !, 
  look up the five french mother sauce . 
   besides : it 's the italians that taught the french how to cook in the first place . 
  not that you guys like to be reminded of that little fact . 
  actually it is commonly known and accepted that french cuisine was first based on italian cuisine , except both countries consider french cuisine has evolved much from there . 
  anyway , this is exactly what i meant , french usine is so influential its basic dishes were adopted worldwide . 
  edit : i did n't downvote you , calm down . 
  ever had steak with fries ? 
  that 's french cuisine . 
  that 's what i 'm talking about . 
  what many consider basic , universal food , is french cuisine . 
  ever eaten anything cooked with sauce ? 
  most probably based on the five french mother sauces . 
  a large majority of cooking techniques were codified and/or optimized by the french and still are to this day . 
  restaurants are pretty much a french invention . 
  also , france was the most culturally influential in the western world for a long time . 
  french was the lingua franca for centuries , its culture : cuisine , fashion etc was emulated everywhere so even if french cuisine had been average it would have been massively influential . 
  man , if we french were the ones doing this we would get shat on all over the internet : /, 
  a shit ton of japanese chefs go receive some training in france . 
  both countries cooperate a lot in terms of cuisine . 
  note that a lot of of recipes people might consider as universal actually are french recipes , people just are n't aware of it because french cuisine is so stupidly influential it has become the standard in many ways . 
  also , french cuisine 's supposed over-sophistication is exaggerated because people are used to associate french food with fancy restaurants and high cuisine , when in reality most of french cuisine is based on simple traditional recipes . 
  since the paris attacks the idea the french are in denial and would rather blame belgium keeps coming up on reddit , but it 's just bullshit . 
  it is n't the actual message of the government and tons of major french politicians have been criticizing french security forces and measures as well as insisting on france 's responsability . 
  there are also constantly huge debates about the state of emergency and how efficient or not it is . 
  i repeat , the idea that france has been blaming belgium for everything is just bullshit . 
  all that was said is that belgium has issues with security and that it also affected france , which has its own issues , the main critic being that there is a lack of coordination on security matters between european countries . 
  the debate on terrorism in france is still by far mainly focused on france 's own domestic policies and the trouble in the middle-east . 
  edit : a sentence, 
   especially cause french dubbing is horrendous it fucks up everything i disagree , french dubbing is , with german dubbing , considered the best you can get . 
  for example , miyazaki has praised the french dubs of some of his movies . 
   i mean , how do you dub homer ?!, 
  if it 's a good dub , the translators chose talented voice actors . 
  of course , their performance may not be exactly the same , but they can have just as much personnality . 
  edit : the thing is you have to accept that if you do n't speak the original language , something is gon na get lost in translation no matter what .

  social unrest . 
  huge manifestations . 
  not enough police , not enough border control , huge immigration coming from the neighbour countries ( 35 % of the population is foreign ) , huge population boom , crime rates 4 times higher than metropolitan france , unemployment , lack of hospitals , life is more expensive than it is in metropolitan france , infrastructure problems , water distribution is n't optimal . 
  tl ; dr : the population feels and is abandonned by the government . 
  do you know remi fraise ? 
  the french police killed him . 
  his death sparked riots all over france , yet he was a white frenchman . 
  so farage is a good politician because he `` trigurd leftists ! '', 
  holy shit . 
  i misread . 
  i read national socialist instead of national capitalist . 
  so you 're a monarchist ? 
  there 's a sub dedicated for those questions . 
  like the good ol' days my friend . 
  how surprising . 
  is n't that the case for every country in the world ? 
  would 've been fun to know the reaction of the architect . 
  `` how can i turn this discussion into shitty identity politics ? '', 
  i think the sub is just being honest with itself now . 
  everybody knows that / r/europe is a pro-eu subreddit . 
  meme magics knows no bound and no borders . 
  we shall revive the romeme empire !, 
  execute article 69 ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ), 
  i love protests . 
  especially the kind with dinosaurs in it !, 
  nice aliteration . 
  there are also protests in vladivostok . 
  i never pre-order my games , i just got hit by the hype train for both of those , and i bought acu because i found that ac black flag was really good . 
   i 'm not a citizen of spain , just resident thank god , i knew the spaniards are n't retarded . 
  maybe he thought they were real news but when he understood that they were fake news !!!, 
  wait till gas selling companies hear about this ... 
  i hate myself for buying watch dogs and ac unity , but i hate myself even more for buying no man 's sky . 
  there 's always a party pooper ... 
  username does n't ckecks out at all , the flair on the other hand ... 
  the swiss and turkish flags have the same colors , we might see them burning their own flag . 
  look deeper in the thread in this thread , there 's already one of those ... 
  well at least you are n't right in the middle of it . 
  the official anthem of the anglosphere : https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=pfynvdl0qcw, 
   well i guess i 'm gon na choose to be a black guy from now on . 
  how you doin ' homie ? 
  in other words we 're the best at not speaking english . 
  look at all this ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ non-existent freedom !, 
  it 's cringe , but at least it 's european cringe . 
  what in the actual fuck . 
  more like england is a region of normandy . 
  that 's because there is no `` french '' cider , there is only breton and norman cider . 
  and both are pretty damn good , but they 're uncommon outside of french borders . 
  turkey ranks higher in my esteem now . 
  france also produces cider , but only two regions produce a high quantity of it : brittany and normandy . 
  needs more jpeg, 
  the french one is weird , i mean we have the most powerful army in the eu now that the uk is gone , abd we have an independent nuclear defence system . 
  unless this comic is taking the traditional ( and stupid ) france = dae white flag , very le funny , route . 
  but that does n't make sense , since quatar is inhabited by muslims should n't it be a poor country ? 
  yes that quatar . 
  i know quatar is a shitstain on this world but answer my question : is quatar a rich country ? 
  muslims = poverty . 
  many things can be said about muslims , but muslims equaling poverty is a pretty stupid thing to say . 
  have you heard of a place named quatar ? 
  how do you masturbate with a banjo ? 
   how to argue on t_d : maga maga maga you forgot : `` cuckcuckcuckccuckcuckcuckccuckcuckcuckccuckcuckcuckccuckcuckcuckccuckcuckcuckccuckcuckcuckccuckcuckcuckc !!!!!!!!! '', 
  no please do n't start this trend again !, 
  not another `` europe according to x '' pleaaase !, 
  i know that . 
  the why i said `` the overseas regions ** and ** corsica '' as to differentiate the two . 
  where are the overseas regions and corsica ? 
   the french judging by your flair , you 're probably one of us mate . 
   after the queen 's speech , we all then proceed to fart the national anthem . 
  in wich direction ? 
  fichues officines qui ourdissent !, 
  i do n't think even you guys are mad enough to eat brussels sprouts . 
  `` we 're collectively farting in brussels direction '' could be a good one . 
  the two are n't related , new-caledonia is n't possibly leaving because we gained mayotte . 
  both . 
  that 's because he is one , except he 's far-left instead of being far-right . 
   europe  communist pick one . 
  why ? 
  hollande is not even the lowest one !, 
  come on austria !, 
  well according to this poll there is still 44 % of the scottish people that wants independence . 
  aw come on , a good march and you 'll be in paris in no time !, 
  yeah , never went there though . 
  well to be fair the rulers of england at that time were french . 
  * jeanne i assume that 's what you were trying to go for . 
  why through belgium ? 
  why not through alsace-lorraine it has a beautiful countryside , we both know that . 
  the french basque country is also a popular tourist destination , it 's one of the best surf spots in france . 
  proves my point further , it does n't matter what scottish people are thinking about now , it 's what they 'll be thinking about in 2020 or 2021 that will matter, 
  says nicola sturgeon and the british state . 
  well the refenredum will be in 2018 or 2019 , so it does n't really matter . 
  well it can still trade with the uk while being independent . 
  welp too bad , cause now alsace is french , and it will stay that way . 
  your sentence is correct except for the word `` foulle '' ' that word does n't exist . 
  and another nice argument . 
  i bet you 're a really intelligent and sensible person . 
  that 's a really nice argument you got there . 
  let me guess , you would choose trumpland ? 
  yeah , sweden has problems with its migrant population but calling them cucks and saying that sweden is a hellhole will not help resolve the problem . 
  22 is wilders . 
  was n't there a massacre made by a guy in a batman costume during a viewing of the dark knight ? 
  ** d ** ** e ** ** u ** ** s ** ** v ** ** u ** ** l ** ** t **,

i think they have to stay in the country that granted them asylum , and if they want to move they would have to apply for asylum in the country they want to go to . 
  i 'm not sure though . 
  you might add the roman empire rests , the arles arenas or orange theater are gorgeous piece of architecture , although not unique to france . 
  vauban 's fortification are marvellous too , a great display of beauty and genius at the same time . 
  yes and no because the tourists counted are those who come in france , pay and visits in france . 
  the guys that just travell through france are n't counted . 
  then again , some indeed do an `` euro-trip '' but they are n't the majority of tourists in france . 
  i would n't link the sun king with napoleon , they are both considered a golden age , but are very different . 
  the revolution changed france from being the most powerful monarchy of europe to the french empire fighting against the european monarchies . 
  france has never really been a commercial superpower like the uk though , fighting was more our thing . 
  well , the french army perpetrated less crimes in algeria than the fln that literally commited genocide against the harkis and french people that stayed . 
  and there were public apology , everyone just seems to forget them . 
  moreover , in your previous post you talk about muslim-bashing done by the medias . 
  wtf dude , the french medias are widely anti-racism , only far right journals like mariane bash muslims , even le figaro and valeurs actuelles ( the last one a bit less ) have stopped to do so . 
  on tv , muslims are never bashed , a lot of france 2 and 3 journalists are from north-african immigration ( i have members of my family that have worked there/with these companies ) . 
  ironically , in france people still have around 2,1 children by women , which allows the population to grow . 
  if they deal drugs and manage to have a `` casier judiciaire '' , even a small one , they will never get hired anyway ... so yes and no , these guys could do a lot more to get a job . 
  nothing prevent them to go to the neatest college and get a degree , or go to a pr\u00e9pa etc. . . 
  i 'm in med studies in paris , there are some guys from the 93 , very poor areas . 
  they get into studies because they want to leave their cit\u00e9 , and they say only a few from where they come get into srudies because the majority left school . 
  by leaving school they forbid them to leave their cit\u00e9s . 
  worst in europe ? 
  did you just said that ?!, 
  god , i live in france ans no , we have some of the bests in europe !, 
  go to the ghettos in eastern europe , those in france are paradises compared to them . 
  the french always seem to think their country is shitty and full of poor , whereas we may be the country in europe where the poor lives the best with all the aids the government provide them . 
  it can change a bit in the politic orientation , but for europe it does a lot of good i would say . 
  i just stressed that because it has a big impact on who can be elected . 
  lot lot lot of lobbyists , not as much as in d.c. , but close . 
  how ? 
  well then it is even sadder . 
  peopple got ta realize that the fn would n't do better at all than the actual government . 
  we have very educated people at the head of our country . 
  hollande has studied at hec , science-po paris and l'ena , and even if a lot of people do n't like it , that man is one of the most educated of our country and really knows his stuff . 
  that was kinda the same with sarkozy , they just came from different horizons and ahd differents ideas , but still , they were smart and educated and knew what they were talking about . 
  what does marine le pen and her party know about economics ? 
  nothing . 
  simply the fact that they want to leave europe and euro shows that they are either insane or some of the worst liars . 
  i simply do n't get it , how educated people , who ca n't be stupid , can vote for her as it is just obvious that she will ruin the country . 
  every time an economist has analyzed her intentions , he proved that they were insanely dangerous for the country economy , how can people vote for her ? 
  do they all want to lose their job ? 
  i 'm sorry but i 'm so shocked after tonight results , that is the first year i 'm voting and still , i feel as unpowerful as i was before . 
  although it is kinda stupid because fn is n't adapted to modern economy at all either , if they would run the country and do what they are planning to , france would be even worse than spain is today , and only in a few months . 
  i hope people know that , none of the fn leaders has ever studied economics while at the head of ump , ps and udi-modem there are very competent people . 
  `` caca '' means poop in french . 
  it seems they truly hate being called daesh and french politicians only use it to refer to them . 
  it happens in the middle east actually . 
  some terrorist conceal aks or bombs under a burka and then kill a lot of people . 
  and now it 'll never have the chance to become one . 
  hamon will win the primary , that 's for sure . 
  but as for the regular election i do n't think he stands a chance against macron/le pen . 
  he wants to renegotiate it . 
  it 's not anti-europe either . 
  fillon thinks schengen will kill europe eventually , and so to preserve a strong eu he wants to renegotiate it . 
  absolutely not . 
  hamon has no chances at all . 
  it 'll be between le pen and macron , unless fillon can manage to save his ass . 
  and anyway , france is heading towards a two party system fn-lr , unless macron can manage to get people elected in the legislatives elections . 
  every candidate except le pen and m\u00e9lenchon are pro-europe though . 
  you should n't , le pen is a very serious candidate , she 's way ahaed of the others right now actually . 
  she ca n't win the secound round , but her party is the most popular french party right now . 
  macron is being pushed by the networks that pushed clinton and other neo-liberals . 
  that 's why . 
  he is quite right though . 
  hollande and merkel have been doin g the same speeches for years now . 
  probably the opposite of that , actually . 
  being atheist in europe ( and even more in france ) is n't edgy at all actually . 
   totalitarian society, 
  if you want to live in a totalitarian society it is your right to have that opinion i guess , but i strongly disagree with you . 
  some articles on the guardian are very biased . 
  no , censoring is n't the solution , it never worked and never will . 
  the solution is better education . 
  this sounds like a ministry of truth idea . 
  all this fakenews thing is handled very poorly . 
  censoring is not the solution because of all the abuses . 
  the solution is getting the people more aware of fake news , and more capable of identifying bs from truth . 
  most of them never leave the country they are in even after being denied asylum , or the deportation process takes years . 
  then you may not be aware of everything she planned to do . 
  huge cuts to welfare , healthcare etc. . . 
  this seems pretty accurate , she is a centrist economicaly . 
  there is always a motion of no confidence brought forward though . 
  each time the `` frondeurs '' refused to throw out manuel valls . 
  very on the right economically , so no social programs . 
  [ here ] ( https://www.politicalcompass.org/images/france2017.png ) is where he stands . 
  you 're very delusional if you think they wo n't . 
  will he do it though ? 
  he seemed like a king of pandering lile trudeau during the campaign . 
  according to polls , most people thought the election was meaningless or did not know who to vote for/did not like any candidate . 
  there is still a vote with 49.3 . 
  most people do n't lile him , they just did not bother votong because they thought it was meaningless , add to that the fact that his supporters will lilely be disappointed and you should be worried for 2022 . 
  to be honest i 'm not optimistic at all , i think there will be a huge pendulum effect in 2022 , towards who is the question . 
  it 's not a reference , it really was a brothel for quite some time . 
  you simply do n't raise awareness about the condition of the french black women by only allowing in french black women , this is plain retarded . 
   there was a genuine armed movement against gaddafi , just as there was against assad , and it 's not difficult to find arms in that part of the world . 
  there was terrorist groups , that part is true , but there was no real people uprising . 
  right now lybia is a failed state and men and women are sold in auctions like cattle . 
  getting rid of kadhafi like that was a bad decision . 
  russia has actually some everage over france . 
  most if not all of our gas comes from them , and most of our uranium too ( and we have almost nothing else than nuclear energy ) . 
  he also wants cultural exchanges and better cooperation between france and russia , so that the youth of both countries can understand eachother in order to achieve a durable peace .

   even though when in class we say p in k [ x ] ( with k = c or k = r ) , we never really properly introduced complex polynomials and i actually thought that pairs of complex conjugate numbers would also be roots of complex polynomials as well . 
  but then it makes sense . 
  i remember drawing some figures where it seemed like the roots could n't possibly be conjugate but had decided it was probably due to my poor drawing skills ( they 're abysmal ) . 
  i became aware of the last two points very recently when looking for more data on that problem . 
  i am patiently waiting for my algebra professor to check his emails ( he too is on vacation so , i 'm not holding my breath :p ), 
  i actually went back to college recently and am studying mathematics now ( starting the 2nd year in september ) . 
  i 've been reading on galois theory which seems like it could eventually answer my questions ... but really , why the roots of x ^ 4 -1 form a square and that of x ^ 4 - x ^ 2 + 1 a rectangle is really bugging me . 
  more specifically trying to find if there is a way to link changes to the coefficients of a polynomial to whatever geometric transformation will occur ... anyway !, 
  i hate vacations , i need my professors !, 
  t __ t, 
  i remember having a long and fascinating conversation with a german friend about these translations during which i eventually questioned the pertinence of the french name of mcduck ( picsou ) before eventually finding a way to make peace with it . 
  unrelated : so glad i decided to check out what your username meant , i 've been obsessed with geometry these past weeks and found some interesting things while looking for the theorema egregium , 
  i remember the 98 world cup pretty well . 
  i even surprised myself being glad we 'd won !, 
  ( context : i hate french sport commentators , they 're way too chauvinistic for my taste and as a result tend to not be disappointed when france loses , at least the commentators leave us in peace . 
  actually , back home we used to watch sports events on belgian channels . 
  i hate not being able to do that anymore . ), 
  thanks for that detailed list !, 
  i was waiting for a spanish contribution . 
  now i 'll be able to look for documentaries and work on my spanish a little ( here 's hoping for auto generated subtitles !, 
  ah , that makes sense . 
  that sentence ' * in 1985 , a campaign to pardon and release unterweger from prison began * ' was a little confusing because of the word pardon . 
  thanks for the clarification !, 
  it 's still recent ( compared to other flavors ) . 
  i did because i had liked the actor in the guard so much . 
  it was a great movie ( if a little depressing ) . 
  i must confess i may have secretly enjoyed one episode of derrick or two as a kid . 
  trying to find more info on the second girl eventually led me to a thesis on photography and painting ( of which i understood nothing ) ... that was weird \\ ^ \\ ^ '', 
  so that 's where the expression comes from . 
  ca n't believe i never looked it up before . 
  til !, 
  there was case where a gendarme was the culprit . 
  some people investigating had started to believe he was either a cop or a gendarme due to the very specific way of phrasing things in the letters he 'd send to gloat about his acts ( assaults , thefts ) . 
  neither the police nor the gendarmerie wanted to believe the culprit was in their own ranks so proper verification of alibis came very late . 
  the guy , alain lamare , was declared criminally irresponsible ( because he was insane ) and was , therefore , never judged though he killed one person and assaulted / hurt many more ( especially two colleges by booby trapping a car ) . 
  the fact that that acronym even exists is pretty awesome . 
  quite the weird case . 
  fits well with the image given by the movie [ the guard ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_guard_ ( 2011_film ) xd . 
  loved that film , btw, 
  i 've always loved opera in german ( better than in french actually ) . 
  i had never heard of blood libel before . 
  i see from the caricature in the article that a parallel was made with the dreyfus affair . 
  this reminds me more of [ l'affaire calas ] ( https://www.museeprotestant.org/en/notice/the-calas-affair/ ) which was publicized by voltaire 's defense of the accused : a protestant accused of the murder of his son . 
  calas was sentenced to death in 1762 . 
  he was tortured , put on [ the breaking wheel ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/breaking_wheel ) , strangled then burned . 
  voltaire 's involvement started after calas ' death . 
  calas was posthumously rehabilitated though . 
  whenever minors are judged in france , the trials usually take place '' * \u00e0 huis clos * '' ( like sartre 's play , meaning to public , no press ) if someone involved in the case who was a minor when the facts took place asks it ... which is often the case . 
  that 's all i meant . 
  damnit but that second article was hard to read . 
  i 'm surprised at how this was handled though , especially the fact that they were judged in public . 
  nasty case . 
  a few cases in france have made people question the ever infallibility of confessions . 
  most famous one is the arrest of [ patrick dils ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/patrick_dils ) for the murder of two boys in montigny-l\u00e8s-metz . 
  he was 16 at the time of the murder . 
  he came under suspicion and eventually confessed to the murder . 
  he was convicted a first time ( the jury did n't even take his minority into account and sentenced him to life in prison ) . 
  he appealed , was convicted again . 
  what made the tides turn for him was the fact that a very famous serial killer , [ francis heaulme ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/francis_heaulme ) had semi confessed to the murders to a cop . 
  that man would usually describe being witness to the murders he committed and described the montigny-l\u00e8s-metz murder in great details ... except that he never said where that scene had taken place . 
  so it took the cops in charge a long time ( and some chance ) to figure out he may be the one who killed the two boys . 
  it turns out heaulme was in that particular town when the boys were murdered . 
  that plus his semi confession were enough to cast doubt on dils ' guilt . 
  although heaulme never actually confessed to the murders . 
  the cop who knows him best suspect it 's because heaulme fears his sister would stop visiting him if he confessed to another child murder ( because she had done so in the past ) . 
  heaulme was tried for that murder but not convicted due to lack of evidence . 
  dils was retried and declared innocent after 15 years in prison . 
  i 'm keeping the stig bergling page for later , i love a good spy story . 
  could n't remember where i 'd heard the name kurten before ... 
  the band whitehouse made an album called [ dedicated to peter k\u00fcrten ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dedicated_to_peter_k%c3%bcrten ) . 
  that genre of music is as far as you can get from easy listening ... [ that particular track ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83hazu5rn98 ) named after k\u00fcrten is very headache inducing for example ( the newman song you linked though is pretty nice ) . 
  had never read about that dude in detail though ... damn . 
  thanks !, 
  the automated translation is a bit hard to follow but it gives good insight nonetheless . 
  could n't help but think of [ that south park episode ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/free_hat ) ( in which , based on a misunderstanding , people start calling for the release of a toddler murderer ) when i read about that unterweger guy . 
  it 's unusual to see such activism for the release of someone who was found guilty . 
  there are a few instances here where intellectuals took side for a guy but usually , the cases were at least ambiguous , the evidence sketchy . 
  in other words , it was a battle for their innocence , not their release . 
  it 'd be difficult to find public support for the rehabilitation of criminals here as recidivism has been used countless times as a way to score easy political points ( most notably by sarkozy when he was minister of the interior , but not only ) . 
  holy shit , that first story !, 
  i 'm really bummed i ca n't find more sources on that crisis as the wiki article is quite short ( but then , the one in estonian looks even shorter , what gives ? 
  is estonian that concise a language ? 
  i remember watching a documentary on the cannibal of rothenburg and feeling very nauseous indeed . 
  i do n't remember hearing about those nsu killings , i probably was n't paying close attention to the news at that time . 
  i see a movie was made about that story this year . 
  have you seen it ? 
  is it worth watching ? 
  i remember coming across this case when investigating why on earth the germans would name scrooge mcduck after a 7th century french king xd, 
  i remember that case well . 
  it created a big scare in my region ( which borders belgium ) , it was everywhere in the news . 
  [ michel fourniret ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/michel_fourniret ) is sometimes referred to as a french dutroux or as the le monstre des ardennes . 
  his wife ( monique olivier ) would help him kidnap girls ( women are n't as scary as men so they 'd easily get in the car ) which he would keep hidden , abuse and eventually kill . 
  he 's also famous because during one of his stay in prison , he gained the trust of a famous bandit who told him where his band ( [ le gang des postiches ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gang_des_postiches ) ) had hidden a very big sum of money . 
  he killed the bandit 's wife and stole their treasure . 
  damn , a real life slasher movie . 
  i was n't surprised to see a movie had been made about it . 
  how was the movie received in finland ? 
  ca n't believe i forgot to mention jack the ripper . 
  last theory i heard about was some german sailor committing the murders in london and then migrating to new-york or something . 
  not sure how serious that theory is , i did n't find the evidences really compelling .

  there was a period of relative calm during the 00s , but it looks like that was exceptional . 
  in any case , we do n't let terrorists determine our behaviour - that 's what they want and fuck them they wo n't win . 
  french media are reporting three men and a woman held since early this morning . 
  two french-born men of turkish origin plus an islamist `` already well known to the anti-terrorism '' services . 
  no weapons recovered but some computer equipment seized . 
  edit : also a kalashnikov cartridge seized . 
  veterans today [ profile ] ( http://ppia.wikia.com/wiki/veterans_today ) for what it 's worth . 
  these guys have no class whatsoever . 
  he looks like the outcome of [ care in the community ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/care_in_the_community ) style policies . 
  looks too small an explosion for a car bomb attack . 
  driver was the target i expect . 
  if possible yes , but who knows how long it will take for a stable regime in syria . 
  i 'd like him locked up now . 
   since his 2012 trial ... he has had just one visitor , his mother , who was allowed into prison and gave him a hug shortly before she died of cancer in 2013 . 
  his poor mother . 
  i hope her ghost haunts his dreams . 
  edit : fair enough - i did n't realize she treated him badly . 
  though there 's simply no comparison with his actions . 
  i still hope she haunts his dreams . 
  posted two days ago [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4a4y2d/majority_of_french_defends_a_referendum_on/d0xqr8p ), 
  let 's clear things up a bit . 
  the point of `` je suis charlie '' is that people were killed specifically for exercising their right to free speech . 
  `` i am charlie '' was a way people chose to say `` i will continue to exercise my right to free speech even though thugs with guns try to take it away . '', 
  does it make any difference to the victims ? 
  no , because they 're dead , but it 's an important political statement about free speech , even if it 's expressed in a twee way . 
  the ` stand with paris ' or whatever it was ( people changing their profile pictures to a flag background ) is much closer to what 's happening in ankara . 
  terrorists are killing innocent people for political ends . 
  the killings are random and inhuman . 
  so of course i ` stand with ankara ' , for whatever good it will do the people of ankara . 
  of course i empathize , having grown up in a place with all-too frequent bombings . 
  of course i 'm horrified at the randomness of the killings . 
  but i do n't need to wear my feelings publicly like some sort of badge . 
  i did n't express much when paris was attacked and some people i knew were impacted . 
  i wo n't express much when ankara is attacked by suicide bombers . 
  i might if it 's an issue of free speech because that 's a different principle . 
  all of the `` sky is falling '' comments are missing an important point : a despicable fuckhead has been locked up in sweden . 
  that should be reason for cheerfulness . 
  oh it was of course yes . 
  but it 's a good indication of how deep and abiding boris 's love is . 
  i appreciate it and benefit from it . 
  i 've worked in six different eu countries . 
  i studied in two partly with the aid of an eu grant . 
  i 've visited twelve eu countries over the years . 
  a lot of this would have been possible without the eu , but it would 've been a lot more administrative hassle , and i hate administrative hassle . 
  any chance that the place where the lander touches down could be named for david bowie ? 
  this is if the acronym/abbrevation can be enunciated as a word . 
  if it is spelled out , like eec , oecd , imf , it remains in all caps . 
  he loves it so much that he [ renounced his american citizenship last year ] ( http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2015/02/boris-johnson-renounces-us-citizenship-tax-bill-mayor-london/385554/ ) . 
  yes , cote d'ivoire is the biggest exporter of cocoa in the world , also exports petroleum , coffee , and other ` equatorial ' farm produce . 
  abidjan is a regional hub for many businesses in west africa . 
  it looks like [ lots of countries ] ( http://www.defenseindustrydaily.com/us-hellfire-missile-orders-fy-2011-2014-07019/ ) have bought these missiles . 
  they seem intended for air launching ( helicopters and drones ) , is it possible to launch them from the ground ? 
  edit : answering my own question : [ yes ] ( http://www.janes.com/article/39517/hellfire-launch-from-ground-es14e3 ) but it 's non-trivial . 
   lockheed martin hellfire missiles have been fired from a ground vehicle for the first time using a moog third-generation stores management system . 
  the sms provides the interface between the targeting sensors , operator stations , command and control systems , and the weapon launchers . 
  there 's an argument for limiting coverage of a terrorist attack * while events are still unfolding * . 
  when the kouachi brothers ( charlie hebdo massacre ) were trapped inside a signage works , there was a worker hidden in the building with them for about 8 hours . 
  they did n't know he was there but a politician spoke about him on radio and then a couple of tv stations picked it up . 
  this was a serious fuck up by the media . 
   driving leyland cars and telling mercedes and bmw to shove it and here we arrive at clarkson 's real reason for staying in eu . 
  anything that makes paris even prettier gets my support . 
  it 's a poor majority at 53 % and there are still more people who want to stay in the eu ( 45 % ) than leave ( 33 % ) or express no opinion ( 22 % ) , even within the confines if this poll . 
  when life gives you lemons ... 
   part of the anger behind the no tav movement lies in its general disaffection with italy 's corruption . 
  opponents of the line believe that key beneficiaries will be not ordinary italians but shady forces in the construction industry . 
  this is why we ca n't have nice things . 
  seriously , attacking a massive and wonderful engineering project because your country is too corrupt ? 
  it 's the wrong way to go about reform . 
  interesting stories and clearly the two guys were n't fleeing an impossible situation in afghanistan , otherwise they could n't have gone back . 
  the guy who found a job in kabul eventually should have gone there in the first place rather than wasting his savings being smuggled to germany . 
  the guy who wanted to study psychology ... 
  he 's an economic migrant . 
  as in topsoil ? 
  turf sometimes , or topsoil , or just the ground . 
  for racecourses , turf would be pretty standard . 
  good news that they 've been caught . 
  thanks for the summary . 
  peat is commonly referred to as turf in ireland when cut and dried . 
  [ example1 ] ( http://www.wesleyjohnston.com/users/ireland/geography/bogs.html ) , [ example2 ] ( http://www.irishamericanmom.com/2015/01/19/what-is-irish-turf/ ), 
  the turf cut from the ground gives about half the heat of coal , i think . 
  maybe 10 % less than dry wood . 
  the compressed briquettes give better heat . 
  in dublin this happens with guinness every ten days or so . 
  i think they might be flushing the vats and the smell can travel for several kilometres . 
  a fire like a ground/bush fire ? 
  i associate turf fires mostly with being in the west of ireland , but if people are burning peat briquettes you can get the smell anywhere . 
  ireland smells of turf ( peat ) smoke . 
  it 's a bit like the taste of laphroaig ( the scottish whisky ) . 
  this article was in the guardian last week , then the irish times , now in irish central . 
   it 's new becoming a communist . 
  i know , and i wish it would be replaced with something else . 
  no , i do n't either . 
  this is coming from the lib dems , who are basically nowhere in uk politics at the moment . 
  the independent has been calling for cannabis legalisation for decades , if i remember correctly . 
  maybe started in the early 90s ? 
  wow , she was 15 when she was arrested . 
  teens should get back to drinking and smoking for their rebellion . 
  enough of this islamism nonsense . 
   before the conflict , syria had roughly 31,000 doctors , according to the country 's ministry of health . 
  today , physicians for human rights ( phr ) estimates that about half have left the country ; hundreds more medical personnel have been detained or killed .

  i 'm not talking about the government but society as a whole , there 's no need to work yourself up about this . 
  french society is reacting to this by demanding further restriction of poor muslim immigrants for example something that 's considered racist in `` the land of immigrants '' . 
  the unfortunate rise of fn proves that . 
   people love to bring up the fact that 40 % of our prison population is black as evidence of how racist we apparently are . 
  i have never , nor will i ever say that the us government is racist . 
  nor will i ever say that the white population in general is racist . 
  in fact , minorities seem to be more racist than whites . 
  oh please , are you seriously claiming that the us is n't hypersensitive when it comes to racial issues ? 
  sure , we have our problems as well but we definitely are n't afraid to grab the bull by its horn . 
  anyways , this is pointless . 
  i generally dislike people who deny facts for nationalistic reasons . 
  as i said earlier , i 'm very much pro-us so this is pointless . 
  it is definitely , without a doubt the entire country . 
  not really , notice how it just had to be an american who brings up the racial card in this discussion . 
  that 's true but the focus on race in the us is something that is widely spread throughout your nation . 
  / r/europe danes seem to have a problem with context . 
  it is something i 've noticed , the danish are n't the only ones on that boat though . 
  anything that comes out of denmark is by default superior and can not be criticized on / r/europe . 
  obviously i do not interact with the danes on a regular basis in real life , so i tried to refrain judging the entire country but seeing how you 're confirming this , i guess it 's just sad ... 
  racial focus will always be downvoted here and frowned upon in europe . 
  unlike the us ( a country i very much love !, 
  ) , we are n't tumblr idiots . 
  this is about a banking union , not the euro . 
  even the danes who have an interest in europe like / u/mrstrange15 suffer from a delusional superiority complex , if the eu ever federalizes , it 'll be without denmark . 
  fairly sure that they are protected in all of those countries , as i 'm sure they are as well in denmark . 
  we 're talking about progressiveness here , so yes , they are in fact more progressive than you guys are . 
  downvote for linking pdf file without mentioning it . 
  also , i 'm talking about domestic ethnic tensions , not those between immigrants and native french . 
  france has had political problems long before the immigrants over set foot on french soil . 
  i did n't say that she did n't thought that , just saying that how highly respected she is in denmark does n't matter to me . 
  i 'll look further into who she is but as of now , i consider her to be the worst eu commissioner . 
  so they 're more progressive than denmark . 
  / discussion http://www.businessinsider.com/antwerps-red-light-district-2013-11?ir=t, 
  i 've bookmarked it and i 'll read it but frankly , i do n't care how highly respected she is in denmark . 
  she 's now my commissioner as well , she now has power over me as well . 
  she is n't danish anymore , she 's european . 
  because that 's what we are discussing , taking things out of context seems to be something you like to do , is n't it ? 
  coincidentally , denmark is also the most xenophobic country of the countries i 've named , if not , of the eu . 
  i 'm talking about the treatment from the point of view of the government . 
  unfortunately , the netherlands and belgium were kinda lose with muslim and other immigrants that tend to be less open to homosexuality . 
   she made an example , so that it would be more relatable to more people , it 's not like she only wants to do this for her own good ... bullshit !, 
  they irritated her and she then decided to act . 
  if she did n't watch danish shows , she 'd probably not care enough . 
   and that 's simply not true . 
  if you had bothered to look into her political life , you would know that . 
  but you seem like the person that just read the headlines and then form an opinion anyway , so maybe i could n't expect that much from you . 
  thanks for the ad hominem . 
  no one cares , you 're still not the most progressive . 
  i 'd rather be gay in the netherlands or belgium than in denmark . 
  you asked about ethnic tensions , we do n't have those in france . 
  i was talking about the benelux . 
  belgium has the same prostitution laws as the netherlands , in fact antwerp is considered the best and most clean prostitution city in the world by some . 
  because she 's selfish and only acts when she personally experiences negativeness over a certain issue . 
  her `` i ca n't watch my danish shows in brussels , we need to do something about geo-blocking '' remark from a couple of weeks ago are still fresh in my mind . 
  i 'm saying that having just one culture ( 5 million danes , paris alone has more people ) helped your `` country '' ( = it 's basically a city ) . 
  it 's not the culture itself that made your city , oh sorry , country successful but the fact that there is just one dominant culture which makes it incredibly easy to run denmark . 
  if france had 5 million people and just one culture , we 'd be as , if not more successful than denmark . 
  i was more thinking in the range of euthanasia laws , lgbt-rights , drug laws , prostitution laws , ... also , the ethnic tensions in belgium for example are handled in the most civil way this world has ever witnessed according to many political scientists . 
  do n't even start comparing your small insignificant country with france . 
  the scots were smart enough to recognize that staying in the uk is better . 
  so the danes are stupid enough to vote against their own interest ? 
  got it . 
  she 's probably the worst commissioner in the juncker commission . 
  i have never been to taco bell in my life , they were just the first places that serve `` mexican food '' that popped into my head . 
  there we have the bragging again . 
  your culture has produced absolutely nothing , your small homogeneous population has . 
  your countries are just extremely easy to manage and run compared to the others . 
  denmark and the others have almost no international responsibilities , no internal ethnic tensions , no domestic economic disparities , etc. . . that is what makes you different from germany , uk , france and the benelux . 
  quite frankly , the later is more progressive than you guys are actually . 
  edit : love the downvotes , keep 'em coming !, 
  i know that reading the truth hurts your `` we 're superior in every single way '' conviction . 
  scandinavia has always been poor throughout history whilst we , the germans , the british , the benelux people were booming on all scales , industrialization started very late in scandinavia for example . 
  wars create complex societies , that 's just what we , unlike you guys , are . 
  we make their foods better , keep the country 's label and then they take the credit . 
  tikka masala , india 's national dish , is allegedly created in london . 
  ok , thanks !, 
  i just knew that one of the first person who 'd reply to my comment would be a danish guy . 
  jesus , is vestager a god or something in denmark ? 
  yeah , yeah , you 're the `` i love traditional stuff '' - type of person . 
  i get it , hipster . 
   the texas constitution requires me to say that texas is n't merely equal ** to other u.s. states ** . 
  so `` in that case '' just does n't make any sense . 
  what case ? 
  they are n't states of the us . 
  i consider chipotle and taco bell , to give you an example , as food places that serve american mexican food . 
  joints like chipotle simply are n't mexican , they are american mexican . 
  all the sauces , cheeses , the variety of vegetables and so much more are all american and definitely not mexican . 
  it 's like saying that my 4-meat , 6-cheese lasagna is italian , it is n't . 
  mexican food is okay-ish , american mexican food on the other hand , delicious !, 
   european union regulators opened an extensive investigation on wednesday into the way 11 eu governments ** subsidise utilities to ensure against blackouts ** , concerned that such support schemes may breach state aid rules . 
  because fuck those governments who 'll do anything to avoid a black-out , am i right margrethe ? 
  how are you going to watch your `` danish shows '' at home in belgium and denmark when there 's a black-out , margrethe ? 
   the european commission said it would ask ** belgium , croatia , denmark , france , germany , ireland , italy , poland , portugal , spain and sweden ** for information on existing schemes or their plans to set up one . 
  i hope that paris is going to give them the middle finger on this one , seriously . 
  and the netherlands even though some of you act tough . 
  we are incredibly above your weight , do n't challenge us . 
  western european countries ( all 28 eu members actually ) gave the eu the mandate to negotiate this . 
  unless your government is made up of retarded people who instantly regret decisions they 've made , they definitely want this !, 
  also , german delusional anti-americanism is n't going to take over the eu . 
  keep your hysteria in your own country , thanks !,

  ( https://imgflip.com/i/17iwsq ) i hope my answer helped . 
  around arab neighborhoods is what they said, 
  that helicopter is getting multiple positive hits on an armoured vehicle . 
  so unless atef the civilian has an armoured car in his garage i doubt it . 
  he was denied entry to germany, 
  maybe you can trade catalonia for portugal and leave when they come in . 
  google is n't a monopoly because they try to be , they 're a monopoly because they 're the best .

  just look at all the bing jokes . 
  the french news is playing audio of the screams of the dying over a slideshow of pictures . 
  they want a reaction for sure . 
  i do n't get why europe tries it 's best to look anti business . 
  if anything this will only make people feel like they are being repressed/oppressed . 
  80 now .

  you 're called baltics because you 're on the baltic sea . . 
  i like muslims just fine . 
  just not when they blow themselves up and kill my countrymen at a rock concert . 
  i just want to sleep all day today . 
  wrong subbredit to try to do that shit . 
  when you invent a sport you can name it . 
  the people of kosovo are ethnically albanian , so a lot of albanian nationalists advocate for a `` greater albania '' that encompasses all albanian people . 
  well at least we know where they align politically !, 
  germany is turning into a meme with all of this . 
  they should have kicked them out and blacklisted them . 
  hey that 's better than killing them . 
  fran\u00e7ois premier would be decent . 
  but napol\u00e9on bonaparte is my undying leader so hey it works out . 
  your country stabbed us in the fucking back . 
  the belgian jokes i could make . . 
  this is r/europe not r/america . 
  it 's the leading hypothesis . 
  if you asked any european on the street they would tell you that they want free travel in the eu , but closed borders to the outside . 
  obviously qualified individuals should have pathways in . 
  but when the eu was created i doubt they envisioned a country emptying itself of 7 million people and massive immigration like this . 
  how the fuck am i `` eurasian '' . 
  i 'm not living with a goat in the ural mountains . 
  i 'm about as europe as you can get . 
  i never expected to see this in my lifetime . 
  enough is enough . 
  why the fuck does every european country feel the need to go politically correct and make sure they do n't offend anyone . 
  you know what i do if i do n't want to see nudists ? 
  i do n't look at them . 
  i do n't get why we have to change laws or social constructs to accomdate refugees . 
  if you well and truly are a refugee , you are n't staying long enough to give a damn . 
  and i 'd you 're staying longer , integrate . 
  do n't change our cultures that have withstood time and trial . 
  they 're trying to tax google search . 
  you know sooner or later companies will just pull out and then the eu will blame the `` corrupt evil businesses '' for pulling out . 
  you ca n't tax online services . 
  you just ca n't . 
  it 's ridiculous . 
  google is n't selling anything , they are providing a free service that people use . 
  eu taxes are wack . 
  fuck that shit . 
  i never said i represent the majority . 
  in fact someone saying that is something that goes against the very core values of our republic . 
  in all honesty when i meet moroccans in their country they 're wonderful people . 
  but in france they 're assholes . 
  muslims are in france what conservatives in the us would call a `` problem minority . '', 
  well no . . because anyone with election knowledge knows that each region votes as a whole based off of the result of the election . 
  and a state ( corsica ) that has been a bastion of socialists and left parties , voting out of their usual place is huge . 
  that system makes it so no one has a lesser vote . 
  the one that has corsica :p, 
  sarco is the ugly one . 
  flamby the weak one . 
  in all honesty though . . 
  i would prefer zlatan over flamby . . 
  he was ugly , unlikable , and most likely corrupt . 
  but being french i can tell you that if our lives remain unchanged we are perfectly content with that . 
  but flamby has fucked us sideways . 
  i got you homie . 
  france is trying to change the way the work week works . 
  the basic work week is 35 hours long , with additional time and holidays payed at a higher rate . 
  but from what i understand , the government wants to lower the rate to around 10 % tacked on for extra time . 
  it 's a significant drop over what used to be 25 % and 50 % in some situations . 
  when my grandfather worked on holidays in the 50 's -90 's he got 300 % on top . 
  notice the change ? 
  another big problem for the french is the fact the law makes it easier to fire people . 
  obviously the initial thought is `` that just makes sense , do you job and you stay . '', 
  but when you 're confronted with 10 % unemployment rate , outsourcing to other countries , and migrants/immigrants willing to work for less , you understand why that scares the french people . 
  after all the bullshit that that law contains , ( the previous one was pretty bad too ) the president added insult to injury when he forced it through without submitting it to a vote . 
  ( that 's the emergency powers . ), 
  there 's a very large feeling among the french people that flamby ( man made of flan = no spine ) as we call him , is doing everything in his power to get rid of his weak reputation instead of actually helping europe and france . 
  almost all parties are angry , and in fact instead of helping himself he has in fact hurt his party . 
  french people are stubborn , and are often lifelong voters . 
  the latest elections saw a 30 % vote to the right , 30 % to the far right , and parties like the corsican independence parties taking control . 
  to tie this back into the story , with terrorists , rising unrest , discontent and everything else going to shit , the policemen do not feel protected here in france . 
  the people they arrest can taunt them on the street the next day because jails are too full , ( i have seen it and it disgusts me ) a policeman shooting a knife armed man has the risk of going to jail , and now their brethren are killed at home where they are supposed to be safe . 
  over 50 % of policemen voted for the far right fn party . 
  and we have like 20 parties . 
  if that is n't telling , i do n't know what is . 
  this is long sorry but it 's complicated : /, 
  explain how sarco stabilizing the economie quite well , ( i have a degree in economics ) and then flamby walks the fuck in and tears everything down , makes him worse . 
  look at france .

  when my uncle was very sick , he said he acted in the name of the cia and jesus . 
  i would n't call him religious or pro-american though . 
  i 'm confused as well . 
  but i think that what shocks me is the level of hate . 
  a car crash is frustrating and sad because it 's so stupid . 
  but a crazy attack like the one in westminster was committed by someone so mad and so hateful that he wanted to die killing as many as possible . 
  the very existence of such people is more shocking to me * than sleepy drivers . 
  i 'm not sure it 's the whole story behind my feelings though . 
  i 'd be more willing to see the influence of the treaty of maastricht and the beginning of european cooperation , especially with the strengthening of the police and judicial co-operation . 
  i do n't have any source to back up my claim though . 
  correct !, 
  thanks, 
  online polls are much more favorable to `` smaller '' candidates when they do n't use a method of quota and correction . 
  online polls are biased when it is similar to a twitter poll . 
  you 're implying that the assimilation rate is 0 % . 
  this is a solution about as practical as banning cars . 
  there are millions of muslims in western europe . 
  there may have been about 50 terrorists in europe in the last 20 years . 
  actually banning cars would be easier to implement , more effective at saving more people and less damaging to the west . 
  i seriously disagree with you . 
  today was the perfect example . 
  instead of going in the streets with a semi-automatic rifle , this lone-wolf attacked the police with a knife . 
  besides , in most of the recent terrorist attacks in europe , police response time has been perfect . 
  they have been on the attack location as fast as any armed citizen could be . 
  more people would n't have been saved in nice , munich , brussels or london if the victims were armed . 
  a handgun is useless against a truck . 
  and the attacks are so fast and desperate that the victims are under surprise anyway . 
  edit : i upvoted you because your conversation was interesting, 
  this is what makes me despair . 
  i do n't think there is anything we can do to prevent such random attack . 
  but i 'm sure there will be a number of irrational restrictions just to show that they are doing something about it . 
  this is what 's happening in france . 
  my bag is checked everywhere . 
  universities open only one gate . 
  every metros are stopped if anyone forget their luggage . 
  all of those are simply annoyances , but i think it perpetuates the terror climate without actually preventing anything . 
  two panhandles for austroslovakia !, 
  somehow , homophobia and transphobia are not correlated . 
  the most extreme example being iran where transgender people are supported by the governement whereas homosexuals risk the death penalty . 
  that would be a weirdly consistent line of thinking . 
  but some people who said `` stop bringing up your sexuality '' said it because they did n't want to hear about the husband of the prime minister of luxembourg . 
  somehow , their marriage was sexual contrary to all the others . 
  it does n't work in spain , china or the us, 
  i think we are talking about the bill about things that are already built . 
  you wo n't see the end of the clubhouse and you wo n't pay for the end of the construction . 
  but it 's normal to expect you pay for all the time you were still a member of club . 
  macron is left of center in my opinion . 
  he even worked in a socialist government . 
  drag queens are not transgender . 
  being a drag queen is a profession or a hobby . 
  it would be like electing a tv reality star . 
  i can see why some people would have a problem with that . 
  statistically , there must have been one woman more competent than at least one prime minister in the last 40 years . 
  if none of them are elected , it 's fair to assume prejudice is what prevented it from happening . 
  since the 19th century , the french industry developped in the east where there was coal and iron . 
  now that industries are leaving or automating , many people are left behind . 
  those are more likely to be angry against globalisation . 
  and then you can add local variants . 
  in the south east , there are many families who were expelled from algeria during the independance . 
  the part closer to germany is slightly more religious than the rest of france . 
  ( religion may not be a good indicator in france though . 
  there is a significant leftist catholic population ) . 
  the east is our rust belt . 
  this appears to be quite old . 
  they still hypothesizes about bayrou . 
  i do n't know about latvia . 
  but the whole world seemed interested when our president cheated on his girlfriend . 
  if people wanted a transgender politician to remain discrete about it in france , i would call this double standard . 
  yes europe ended in poland in the minds of medieval europe before russia westernized and moved its capital to saint petersburg . 
  debatable edit : after all everyone came from africa . 
  someone will have to explain to me why the 6th century is sufficiently special to justify who is european . 
  that part became europe thanks to peter the great 's insistence . 
  your definition of europeans is as arbitrary as it gets . 
  by the same logic , barely any americans are actually american . 
  and most of northern africans do n't live in their homeland . 
  yeah i 've read most of ikea is owned by a dutch non-profit organization devoted to improve inside decoration . 
  it 's mostly to avoid taxes . 
  til hungarians are not europeans . 
  do you mean trst ? 
  it 's fun that none of modern-day moldavia overlaps traditional moldavia . 
  i wonder why the soviets did n't call this the bessarabian ssr . 
  yes it is . 
  you can visit it . 
  it is a monument historique . 
  i agree with you here . 
  the self-determination principal was completely disrespected . 
  not only in southern slovakia , but also in the sudetenlandt . 
  i also can understand why trust in hungarian willingness to change the status quo was so easily undermined by the czechoslovak delegation . 
  considering the long hungarian fight against the right of other minorities under the double monarchy and how unstable the first hungarian republic could appear to be . 
  horthy rose to power only a year after the trianon treaty was ratified after all . 
  apparently according to french wikipedia , no actual sieging occured and the seneschal living in the castle never rebelled . 
  the title of count was not claimed by the king himself but by someone in his family ( that 's my memory 's fault in this one ) . 
  but the king distrusted the seneschal who was very closed to the previous count so he passively punished him with the creation of villefranche . 
  he indeed feared the idea of sieging the seneschal if he rebelled . 
  so this was mostly accurate except for the hyperboles added by my teenage memory . 
  the problem with individual self-determination is that it does n't adress existing inequalities and oppression . 
  landowners in czechoslovakia tended to be disproportionately austrians and hungarians . 
  by dividing lands among countries rather than individuals , they effectively redistributed the wealth to previously oppressed minorities . 
  ( there is an argument to be made that masaryk went too far and crippled hungarian economy just for revenge ), 
  sometimes i wonder what awful border gore would have been the outcome of wilson 's plan to let every people the right for autodetermination .

  when i think of brittany beach , i have this [ picture ] ( https://latribudanaximandre.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/la-rose-des-vents-c3a0-poulfeutuen-copie.jpg ) in my mind . 
  i have a renault megane and it 's a mess . 
  but i bought it in occasion , so maybe that 's why it had so much technical problems . 
  generally , my entourage say that renault , peugeot and citroen are okay . 
  not the best , but it 's pretty affordable and easy to maintain . 
  i also heard that the alliance renault-nissan and dacia were pretty popular as well , but do n't know if it enter in your question ... 
  avril * , 
  doit ... r\u00e9sister ... * it 's raining outside !, 
  * shit . 
  speaking proper english and drinking tea ? 
  if you speak french , you should try a french speaking country like france , belgium , switzerland or luxembourg . 
  if you are syrian and homosexuel , i bet you have high chances to be accepted as a refugy here . 
  we do have a lot of muslims , as you said , but they only composed 7 % of our population . 
  plus , here , we just do n't speak about religion . 
  it 's something private , so no need to speak about this subject . 
  for example , i found out one of my friend was muslim only 1 month after our first meet . 
  she refused to eat a saucisson . 
  her bestfriend is gay and her boyfriend is atheist . 
  of course , it 's just an anedocte , but just keep in mind that most muslims here are tolerant . 
  just avoid poor banlieues and prisons and everything will be alright  finaly , you have more chances dying by falling from a ladder than a terrorist attack . 
  do n't fall in their game , that 's what they want . 
  england then ? 
  i woulslike to see a discussion between him and [ joey ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqwzvtjeybq ) . 
  we have karadoc , a knights of the round table , who is known for his inspiring proverb : '' * [ the fat , it 's life ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mt4kwxsf9yw ) * '' . 
  tu as un super bon niveau !, 
  and always screming your machiavellian plans . 
  you should be more discreet !, 
  you understood it ? 
  because sometimes , even for me , it was incomprehensible : / if you want to improve your french , i will answer you in french and then english  * je ne peut pas parler pour l'ensemble des francais , mais je pense que beaucoup de personnes voient cette proposition de m\u00e9lenchon plut\u00f4t positivement . 
  * i ca n't speak for everybody , but i think a lot of people see this proposition pretty positively . 
  in our mind , this kind of change represent a new start , a breath of fresh air in our politics . 
  that 's why it was often put in place after a big war . 
  we want to rebuild the country on new bases . 
  personnaly , i think that the 5th and the 3th republics have the most interesting constitutions . 
  the 5th constitution will give a lot of power to the president and his government . 
  it 's better in case of national crisis or war for example . 
  a parlement will take decision way slowler , so it would not be effective even though the situation require rapidity . 
  the 3th republic is more interesting in term of representativeness . 
  it gave more power to the gouvernement and the law is voted with more debate etc. . . a lot of people want this republic back . 
  edit : i 'm always really fascinated by the amount of words we have in common ... 
   media less focused on ratings and sensationalism i think we have the same problem here . 
  yeah . 
  we even have a candidate , melenchon , who propose a 6th republic . 
  the majority of our constitutions had been created after a war ( 3th , 4th and 5th republic ) but not by revolution . 
  brazil . 
  there is the esma youtube channel which is pretty interesting . 
  it had been created by students from an art school . 
  there are near 100 videos in this chanel , but here are some examples i like : * [ mau ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ae2t4utxxpw ) i never wanted so much to punch a cat . 
  * [ the short story of a fox and a mouse ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6kcwj0sk4s ) * [ catch it ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c88qe6yghfm ) * [ foward march ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwqnveqvlyq ) * [ the window ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95kskbqvcws ) * in french but easily understanstable . 
  she asked at the begining to see charly and wanted to go to the `` princess world '' . 
  [ mon ami charly ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rknzgtinj1s ), 
  it 's the 4th bigest town of norway . 
  no problem , 
  yep , i bought his cd ( my car radio do n't have usb port ) and i absolutly love all his song . 
  it 's quite sad foreigners will never trully understand all the puns in his lyrics . 
  it 's really clever . 
  what ? 
  it 's not a surprise , napoleon wanted to form a blocus on uk . 
  that 's why he attacked portugal as well . 
  but that was just a bonus reason , the main one was to attract even more polish soldier in his army by defending their country . 
  they already composed most of his foreign army and poland was one of the only country he blindly trusted ( contrary to spain ) . 
   the treaty of sch\u00f6nbrunn , which ended the 1809 war between austria and france , had a clause removing western galicia from austria and annexing it to the grand duchy of warsaw . 
  russia viewed this as against its interests and as a potential launching-point for an invasion of russia . 
  in 1811 ** russian staff developed a plan of offensive war ** , assuming a russian assault on warsaw and on danzig . 
   in an attempt to gain increased support from polish nationalists and patriots , napoleon in his own words termed this war the second polish war . 
  well , if they want to attack our ally ... ( poland was our biggest ally back this time ), 
  i guess [ claudio cap\u00e9o - un homme debout ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9gcm9dzujo ) ( it 's about homeless persons ) and [ stromae - quand c'est ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ajw4chksqm ) ( about cancer ) . 
  the lyrics of stromae are really good in general btw . 
  i also like this song from [ coeur de pirate ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwru4we1nq8 ) . 
  * si ton tonton tond ton tonton , ton tonton sera tondu * = if you oncle shave your uncle , your uncle will be shaved . 
  * si ta tata t\u00e2te ta tata , ta tata sera t\u00e2t\u00e9 * = if your aunt palpate your aunt , your aunt will be palpated . 
  my favorite is '' * il ne faut pas pousser m\u00e9m\u00e9 dans les orties * '' which literally mean '' * do n't push granny on the nettles * '' . 
  it means : you must n't go too far , or too fast . 
  take your time and analyse the situation . 
  + * french vanilla : we do n't have vanilla in france ... * french manicure : it 's american * french horn : it 's german * french letter : we say english condom in france , so ... * french press : it 's italian * french cricket : it 's english * french bulldog : it 's english * french disease : it 's spanish, 
  because of that , he lost a lot of men in spain . 
  plus , during the russian campaing , he had to deal with russia and the guerillas from spain . 
  that 's the same kind of war than the algerian or the vietnam one . 
  it 's much harsh on the long term than the usual war . 
  not the best conditions to face russia . 
  and i know the spanish king was n't very trustfull , but causing a coup d'etat was n't a good idea either . 
  a lot of people think the biggest mistake of napoleon was attaking russia in winter . 
  he arrived in russia in june and the main battles happend in august/september . 
  during the attack , the worst in russia was n't the weather , but the scorched earth policy . 
  the war in russia was n't avoidable , while the coup d'etat was our fault . 
  i will say [ annecy ] ( http://www.annecy.com/public/uploads/photo-vieille-ville-annecy.jpg ) ( even though it 's not a small town , but a medium one ) then [ colmar ] ( http://apps.tourisme-alsace.info/photos/colmar/photos/235008803_12.jpg ) and [ sarlat-la-can\u00e9da ] ( https://www.francecomfort.com/cmslib/www.francecomfort.com/francecomfort/omgeving/huge/sarlat_8_plein_terras_restaurant_frankrijk_vakantiepark_francecomfort_villa_zwembad.jpg ), 
  * not participing in the 30 years war and focus on increasing the number of colons in our colonies while the rest of europe was fighting . 
  it would have change the power balance during the 7 years old war later , and maybe even americans would have been speaking french nowodays !, 
  * louis xvi do n't try to run away in austria . 
  that 's what condamned him later . 
  if he have n't done that , france would have been a constitutional monarchy right now . 
  * napoleon not attacking spain . 
  i think this guerilla war is what weakened him the most . 
  the attack of russia was inevitable since they were threatening poland ( as always ) , but the treason behind spain 's back should have been avoid . 
  there was a mcdonald 's machine which did n't work for 6 month in my town , so i went in the other macdonald , even if i had to drive 15 minutes more . 
  i absolutly want my mcflurry daims/caramel . 
  no , we do n't really care about the background of your ethnicity . 
  but you have to share our culture to be considered as french . 
  french comedies in general . 
  they massacred '' [ le dinner de cons ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fhlvec3vae ) '' and '' [ les visiteurs ] ( http://www.allocine.fr/film/fichefilm_gen_cfilm=32547.html ) '' , so i guess the movies `` asterix and obelix , mission cl\u00e9opatre '' , `` oss 117 '' or `` la cit\u00e9 de la peur '' would be horrible .

  but dat 2.9 % unemployment in iceland tho, 
  same thing in canada . 
  canada is often referred to as `` a country of nations '' g8 says its the most fragmented economy in the g8 the vastness of the canadian provinces make the provinces more akin to nations , rather than provinces . 
  they basically govern themselves . 
  especially ontario , qu\u00e9bec , bc , and alberta, 
  please do n't oversimplify a complex problem, 
  please read my comments . 
  i said `` foreigner/foreign decent '' in every . 
  single . 
  comment . 
  i know its hard , because you want to jump at the throat of anyone who has any distain for muslims , but its okay . 
  `` the br\u00c5 has not released detailed data on rape committed by immigrants since 1996 , but according to that report individuals with an immigrant background made up 53 % of all rape convictions between 1985 and 1989 '' http://www.pdf-archive.com/2011/05/08/br-1996-2-invandrares-och-invandrares-barns-brottslighet-1/br-1996-2-invandrares-och-invandrares-barns-brottslighet-1.pdf i do n't speak swedish , but please , if the number is not 53 % , tell me . 
  yes , i mean , br\u00c5 , i do n't speak swedish , so i do n't have swedish characters . 
  you do n't have to be condescending . 
  yes , i also know that the swedish government counts rape statistics wrong , but it still stands that sweden has appalling rates of sexual violence , and that people of foreign decent are highly overrepresented, 
  you want statistics from the swedish bra ? 
  albeit , sweden has n't taken crime stats based on race since 1989 , but in that report over 50 % of rapes were committed by a foreign national . 
  the percentage is now even higher . 
  80 % + of rapes in your country are committed by foreigners, 
   imho multiculturalism is a good thing . 
  brussels has so many different cultures but the problems come mainly from one specific group of people . 
  africans have their own areas with very few problems . 
  s-americans , se asians , all fine . 
  there are more people of foreign decent than belgians in brussels . 
  do n't you think thats a really bad policy ? 
  yeah . 
  europe is for europeans , as it has been for millennia and as it should be for millennia to come, 
  yeah , the rampant crime and poverty points to the old country being best . 
  jesus man , if youre going to be insensitive at least get their language right . 
  they speak jalape\u00f1o, 
  you have a response , other than calling me `` a racist ? '', 
  yeah , i do n't think thats correct ... 
  no , im weary of those who i let in my nation , especially with open borders . 
  its no secret that views that we can call `` extreme '' are very common with some turks - a sizeable minority hold `` extremist '' views . 
  if 10 % of turks hold `` extremist '' views - thats 8,000,000 people - and its way higher than 10 % . 
  leave it to a swede to call someone `` racist '' for being concerned about a nation of 80 million becoming a full fledged european union member . 
  i absolutely harbour no feelings of the inferiority of turks based upon their skin colour or ethnic features . 
  i 'm curious , have you ever seen any polls on attitudes towards things like women 's rights , religious freedoms , support for islamic terror groups , in turkey ? 
  obviously there are millions of turks who would fit in europe quite readily , and those are the people we should be letting in , rather than making turkey a full fledged member of the european union . 
  we also need to work to ensure that turkish residents do not displace indigenous residents , through segregation . 
  unfortunately , its not these moderate turks who control the government ( erdogan , case in point ) and these moderate turks seemingly take a back seat to the islamism thats starting to grip turkey . 
  there are 80 million turks , letting such a disadvantaged country join the e.u. 
  puts massive strain on our nations . 
  they will literally become the largest nation in europe , if they are allowed in . 
  ( not counting russia ) dont forget , that literally since the greeks , the anatolian peninsula has harboured distain for europe and has consistently proven to be our direct enemy . 
  dont stroke your dick too much . 
  well to be fair , the reason they never fought a war on their home soil was because their navy fucking beat the shit out of everyone . 
  its not that nobody wanted to invade - nobody had the capacity to invade . 
  that , and the foreign policy was excellent compared to the absolute monarchies of mainland europe . 
  luck has nothing to do with it . 
  yeah because you directly colonized those places . 
  next youre going to say martinique has lots in common with france . 
  and canada is a tri ocean nation ( pacific , arctic , atlantic ) canada is a member of lots of `` pacific '' organizations . 
  turkey is not european . 
  they have a basket case of a leader , and their people hold extremist views quite regularly . 
  do they want open borders and easy working options for turks ? 
  because expect a lot more turks in europe if this happens . 
  there are nearly 80 million turks . 
  if you 're not european , you 'll never be european . 
  your empire 's record does n't really suggest that, 
  that used to happen at the university of toronto until the 1990s . 
  its not just europe !, 
  france is most def not southern europe . 
  is n't it other refugees committing the rapes and not australian officials ? 
  why ca n't your governments just say `` if you arrive on our soil by way of boat in the mediterranean , you will not be granted asylum , and will be sent back to the port of origin '' these people know that if they set foot on europe - they wo n't be sent back - they know they 're refugees now . 
  france , with the exception of algeria , barely settled anywhere in africa with large numbers of europeans . 
  they administered . 
  not settled . 
  http://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/28/world/europe/28marseille.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0 new york times says 25 % in 2009 . 
  also , the french government doesnt keep statistics on race or religion , so its really just research institutes making educated estimates . 
  so its my duty to help integrate some random ass people who show up in france ? 
  its my culture , adapt or get the fuck out . 
  do it yourself . 
  stop segregating yourself . 
  we do n't have to ask italians or spaniards to adapt to our culture - only non-europeans . 
  the migrant crisis and immigration crisis is a much more paramount event than even the `` communism scare '', 
  how is it somehow france 's fault ? 
  maybe its because we fucking let in a culture incompatible with western values and culture . 
  we have no `` duty '' to assimilate these people . 
  its their own task . 
  we just need to choose our immigrants more wisely . 
  marseille - 30 % + muslim . 
  thats all you need to know . 
  the fact that we have to inform them tells you that you probably shouldnt let them in . 
  man its fucking pitiful that we have to resort to this shit, 
  tell that to japan and south korea also , i agree immigration should be allowed , but immigrants or their descendants should never comprise more than 20 % of a european nation . 
  this is literally the ancestral homeland of white people . 
  when we are the minority , we will never , ever become the majority again . 
  ( in our own fucking homeland ) i 'm curious , have you ever seen demographic predictions for europe in the next 50-100 years ? 
  for sure man . 
  every muslim in europe already is obviously allowed to stay . 
  but immigration from islamic countries should be severely limited . 
  like to literally maybe less than 15,000 / year . 
  how many terrorist attacks before you realize that most muslims hold extremist views and are incompatible with european society ? 
  it is about religion . 
  europe has been under siege from islam , immigration and political correctness for the last 10 years . 
  europe is for europeans . 
  ( still believe that europe should let immigrants , but they should always form below 15 % of the countries respective population ), 
  racist ? 
  we 've had like 20 islamic terrorist attacks in the last 10 years .

  but are the pros worth the cons ? 
  i mean the pros is that you kill every terrorist but the cons is that you kill everyone else as well ... 
   i 've come to hear french people talk about gun-violence and murder among criminal gangs , settling scores it does n't really exists in france . 
  you have like a few shootings a year in marseille but when you compare gang violence in france to the us or mexico we have nothing but angels in our streets . 
  it does n't mean we should n't try to deal with that but people often overreact on that sort of things . 
  the shooting rate in france is extremely low . 
  that period of history is so intense , one of my favourite for sure . 
  you 're absolutly right . 
  but let 's not forget the huge role julius caesar played in that transition . 
  it lacked the name but the republic was dying at that point . 
  let 's not forget as a state italy is less than 200 yold . 
  same for germany . 
  - charles de gaulle, 
  2 ) there 's a word missing in your question , i 'll assume it 's `` solve '' . 
  answer is no . 
  that 's because our diplomacy is shit . 
  we had expert who knew what was gon na happen but nobody listen to them . 
  okay thank you for the input , glad to hear it 's not that drastic tho . 
  you 're absolutly right . 
  we can handle putin because we know how his brain works . 
  he 's a smart man and there 's logic behind what he does . 
  the last thing we want is russia being ruled by a dangerous asshole without any logic . 
  but yeah , it 's really sad to see how little work has been done since the downfall of ussr to modernize the country . 
  i heard recently that 70 % of the wealth of your country is held by 1 % of its residents . 
  what a bunch of mobsters ... 
  never . 
  sebastopol is their only deep water harbor in the black sea . 
  they will never give it away . 
  ever . 
  people assume that in order to succeed eu needs to become the united states of europe . 
  it 's not gon na happen . 
  ever . 
  that does n't mean we ca n't make the eu works but it will be something different , we 'll do it our way . 
  yes we will need to be more unified but nobody is giving up it 's sovereignty . 
  people are never going to accept that . 
   we 're gon na merge into a unified country what ? 
  i 'm being quite harsh for a reason . 
  the standstill is good for nobody . 
  the eu project wo n't fall into pieces . 
  this irrational fear of `` what if '' is exactly the leverage populits use to try and get elected . 
  then why do n't you get the fuck out of eu and wait for mother russia to invade you ? 
  everyone wants the pros of the eu but not the cons . 
  unfortunately it does n't work that way . 
  that 'd be a dream . 
  i know you guys wo n't be able to protect us forever . 
  you have your own interest to watch out for and that 's ok . that 's why we need to step up so we can be on equal foot and work together to make this planet a better world . 
  i realize all of that . 
  but we 're still in democracies and governments ca n't just dismiss public opinion . 
  i 'm more than willing to take it to the next level but most people are n't . 
  and that 's without taking into consideration countries which elected populists governments . 
  the european army is an obligation . 
  people do n't realize our dependancy to the us . 
  be a superpower ? 
  yes . 
  i think every european citizen with a functioning brain knows that without the eu we 're just a bunch of nobodies without any impact on the international scene . 
  however crafting the eu is extremely hard . 
  every time something goes wrong people think the solution is to leave the eu and just turtle up ... like this is going to solve any issue . 
  a lot of people are delusional and vote for populists who blame scapegoats like brussel or germany . 
  as long as france and germany do n't give up the eu wo n't die but man , it 's fucking hard to take it to the next level . 
  the eu wo n't look like a federation anytime soon . 
  history showed us european countries just ca n't give up their sovereignty without starting a bloodbath at some point . 
  the eu needs to develop but it has to take it slow and find its own way of doing things . 
  it 's an utopy to think we can ever fonction like the us for example . 
  i 've yet to see someone saying otherwise . 
  so what ? 
  nothing to add to what my german brother just said , thank 's a lot for helping . 
  if we want the eu to succeed in the long term , a lot of countries should take exemple and give a hand . 
  french dude here , i 'm going to try to explain to everyone what 's going on so everyone can stop fucking freaking out for nothing . 
  france has been way to loose with radicalisation , arms traffic , rogue imams , etc. 
  recently . 
  every one in the country has been asking the government to act on this basically since charlie hebdo . 
  now there is no more time to make laws and proper investigations . 
  our fucking lives are at risks so the only way the government can protect us right now is by bypassing the standard procedures and in order to do that you need the state of emergency . 
  so now , please , amnesty , hrw or anyone else , just shut the fuck up and let us do what we want on our territory . 
  today we want our government to keep us safe , not next year , not next month but right fucking now . 
  our constitution is well enough written so we do n't have to worry . 
  so if we , french people do n't worry , do n't get on your high horse to defend our fucking freedom . 
  thank you . 
  you do n't fly over anyone 's airspace , even if it 's an ally . 
  except if you asked for permission first . 
  i 'm not saying we should forget about it . 
  but it 's like the 2nd or 3rd time i see this mentioned when it 's not relevant . 
  it 's how france was dealing with environmental protesters 30 years ago . 
  the people arrested the other day were n't peaceful protesters . 
  ffs guys , this is so fucking old , stop bringing this up, 
  then what 's the point of even making a sandwich if you do n't eat it with your hands ? 
  this is fucking hilarious . 
  well , french bashing is an olympic sport since 2003 . 
  welcome to the club . 
  yeah we should have 2 carriers . 
  budget cuts , etc. . . 
  yeah you 're right . 
  i guess it 's time for the west to build more carriers then : , 
  india is going to produce rafale by its own so yes , there 's tech transfer there . 
  you do n't really want to sell planes to a country which could sell its tech to anyone until it does n't matter anymore . 
  i 'm not saying all the deals were canceled based on these issues but some were . 
  it 's also true that wether you sell or not your planes depends a lot on the us policy . 
  the us changing its diplomacy toward certain states and conflicts has a huge impact and the rafale is very good option for a country which wants to take some distance with the us , as well as russian aircrafts . 
  you have to add the fact that it takes a while for countries to weight the pros and cons of having such expensive aircrafts . 
  change of government can mean change of defense budget , etc.

  the communists were also contested on their left , by trotskyist , maoist , etc. 
  movements . 
  today even though it makes no sense anymore , you still have ( at least ) two different trotskyist parties presenting candidates every election besides the communists . 
  in may 1968 , when the country was entirely paralysed by a general strike and the students rose up , asking among other things for de gaulle to leave , the communist party was completely panicked and left out of the game , not controlling anything . 
  in 1981 , the socialist party finally comes to power after decades of right-wing rule , and some communists re-enter government . 
  starting from that point , they turn into a mere backup for the socialists . 
  at the same time , the intellectuals eventually break with communism , and the fall of the eastern block completely gives the proof that their ideas would not work . 
  the socialists move further right , and the communists shift in the same way , not advocating any kind of communism anymore but a simply more radical version of the socialists ' programs . 
  at each election they drop lower and lower , only really gathering support from people that are emotionnally attached to the party , until 2007 when their candidate did n't even get 2 % of the votes . 
  the next year , however , a socialist politician ( m\u00e9lenchon ) broke apart from his party because it kept moving to the right . 
  he created the left party and became popular because of his speaking skills . 
  the communists , still having plenty of resources and a well functionning political machine but no electors , accepted to ally with him , followed by many voters but without a proper party . 
  they created the left front , which then opened and federated many other far-left movements . 
  their platform did not follow the communist ideology ( more `` eco-socialist '' ) but was still somehow more radical than what the communists had been for years . 
  m\u00e9lenchon gathered huge crowds and was the revelation of the campaign , eventually getting 11 % of the votes . 
  but since then people have gotten quite tired of him , the left front votes fell back and its unity is very relative . 
  the two trotskyist parties i talked about reacted differently : the lutte ouvri\u00e8re ( workers ' struggle ) party kept extremely sectarian and doctrinal , and remains absolutely fringe . 
  the ligue communiste r\u00e9volutionnaire ( revolutionary communist league ) however , tried to attract younger people less familiar with communist ideology , by presenting a popular and sympathetic young postman as presidential candidate , which had some success ( more than 5 % of votes , for a trotskyist party that 's quite huge ) . 
  but then the hype came down . 
  so they decided to drop the trotskyism altogether and became the `` new anticapitalist party '' . 
  however that was n't such a good move because now they can just criticize capitalism without having anything else to propose . 
   the journey of a 1609.3 km starts with 1 step . 
  thanks mr. bot , you 're really helpful , 
  sounds like a comic book super-villain . 
  schengen only means there are no id checks at the border , not that eu citizens ca n't come live , work and spend their $ uros everywhere in the union . 
  this sounds * very * similar to the [ marbury vs. madison case ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/marbury_v._madison ) in the first years of the united states : in exactly the same way , the federalists appointed federalist judges before losing power to the democrats , who then refused to validate the appointments . 
  instead of giving all power to one party or the other , it increased those of the supreme court itself . 
  yeah , i like onfray ( at least compared to other living `` intellectuals '' ) but he is a complete moron when it comes to foreign policy . 
  how about `` not letting djihadists take down another country and build yet another afghanistan or isis in the center of west africa '' ? 
  there was really no other choice than intervention . 
  france had military ties with mali and the required experience to push back the islamists immediately , so we did . 
  it was n't the result of a long cost-benefit analysis . 
  on the contrary the cost of long-term military presence was too high so we asked the rest of the world and especially african countries themselves to get involved , which is what the minusma is . 
  there 's something important to know though : we do n't * buy * the african uranium , it is already the property of our state companies . 
  so it does matter a bit . 
  now i think people are still way too much cynical about the war in mali . 
  of course it 's in our interest that the sahara does n't become a new afghanistan or isis . 
  it 's in everyone 's interest . 
  it 's not a question of natural resources . 
   these countries are n't used to democracy so you admit it is not a democracy ? 
   despite him being democratically elected . 
  he literally inherited the country from his father and did n't bother even * allowing * any other party during all his rule , until he was cornered in civil war and the west urged to oust him . 
  then the only multi-candidate election took place in full civil war in only one part of the country , boycotted by the opposition , with no international standard , and most importantly against two absolutely unknown people ( while assad 's gigantic portrait is everywhere ) who were officially chosen as candidates by assad 's party and have no problem saying they are not political opposition and do n't intend to win . 
  one of them was even expelled from his own party . 
  really if you consider that to be a free and fair democratic election , you must think the same of all those other `` not-at-all-dictators '' who manage to always get 80-90 % of the votes during decades ( like ben ali in tunisia , 89 % of the votes in 2009 ) , until for some reason they 're overthrown by mass protests , revolutions or insurrections . 
  we westerners must be really bad at governing if even the most popular leaders like merkel can barely get a 54 % approval . 
  it 's sad , but the good news is that the state is acting against arms smugglers . 
  it will be very difficult to eradicate djihadism from our countries , but if at least radicalized people could n't so easily get their hands on rocket-launchers and ak-47 , it 'd already be better . 
  i think the problem is in part from the swedish ( or finnish/german/british / etc. ), 
  government itself . 
  in most european countries , people ( at least at first ) accepted to get in migrants from all around the world but did n't change the way they thought about their nation and national identity : as an ethnicity . 
  so not only the anti-immigration folks always consider non-whites as not * truly * nationals , but always foreigners living in the country , no matter if they have the nationality or not ; but much worse , the leftists themselves actually think the same !, 
  the only difference is that they do n't have a problem with foreigners living in their country , on the contrary it 's exactly what they want : multiculturalism , as in the cohabitation of different cultures and different people . 
  so they do n't even really try to assimilate the immigrants to make them swedish/finnish/etc . , they prefer celebrating and accomodating their cultural differences . 
  of course this does nothing against ghettoization . 
  and if the `` foreign '' population keeps increasing without getting assimilated , people who used to support multiculturalism when it was about being nice to small token minorities realize that if it continues they 're going to `` lose their country '' , so they fall into the arms of the far-right to `` take it back '' . 
  all that because people lied to immigrants when they gave them citizenship papers telling them they were swedish/finnish/etc . , but in fact never considering them as such or even able to ever become so . 
  in france we 're probably a bit closer to the us in this regard : during the revolution we decided that all inhabitants of the former kingdom would be french citizens , including bretons , occitans , alsacians , basques , corsicans ( at the time each speaking a different language ) , etc. 
  but also jews , and blacks and mixed-race people from our then-colonies . 
  since then , our nationality is not based in any way on race or ethnicity , but on our `` will to live together '' as a single people and under the same fundamental principles . 
  even the far-right would n't deny that individually people can be french and of any origin . 
   leader of the jewish community that 's a bit presumptuous . 
  he 's the president of an association claiming to represent german jews . 
  it 's not as if all german jews had a special id and went to vote every four years for their president . 
  otherwise , yes it 's obvious germany can not host all the asylum seekers of the world . 
  even if they were not muslim . 
  the question of refugees is at the international level the same issue as homeless people at the national level : the community has to do something to help them in the short run and fix their problems in the longer run , but still it does n't mean you have to personally host every homeless person who rings at your door without condition and for an indefinite amount of time . 
  if you do , not only you 'll run out of resources to properly house them , and of course your family life will be completely changed , but it 's also not hard to guess that at least a couple of them will be mad or violent and end up ruining it for you and everyone else . 
  it looked good and then mi-france ruined everything . 
  also many former pieds noirs ( european settlers in algeria ) moved there after 1962 . 
  it 's always been a stronghold for the fn , although they never really managed to get as high as they seem to be now . 
  and brits made fun of our socialist party for merely symbolic taxes ... 
  seriously , some of those things , like `` nationalise companies that axe jobs '' are so ridiculous that i already felt a bit ashamed that the only party proposing it in france got 1 % of the votes . 
  here it is your official opposition . 
  what the hell is going on ? 
  not necessarily . 
  the state does n't have to go in details and prescribe what is the correct interpretation of islam and so on . 
  but it can set rules saying that religious teachings have to be compatible with this or that fundamental value to receive certification . 
   seriously ? 
  there are people like this living in a place like france ? 
  there are people in france bombing and slaughtering random people around them , if you had n't noticed . 
   is the national front what i know as front national ? 
  yep  if i was gay , i 'd vote for something like that too . 
  well there is no reason anymore why a gay person otherwise sharing the fn ideas would n't vote for them , considering we already passed gay marriage and they 're not homophobes anymore ( or at least not their leadership and platform ) . 
  and obviously being gay makes you quite more sensible to the problems of having an increasing and too often intolerant muslim population . 
  however people in this thread accusing all other parties of wanting gays dead because of their less strict immigration policies is really over the top . 
  as far as france is concerned , the left-wing does * not * have any tolerance for homophobia coming from muslims , and on the contrary they are the ones who push for more education of people to accept homosexuality . 
  also as always i have to remind that the fn in power would be more counterproductive than anything , because the muslims are already here and french citizens . 
  the best solution is to try and make them more secular , tolerant and progressive , like our unveiled `` muslim '' feminist gay-friendly education minister , rather than voluntarily fuel conflict and division that would only radicalize them . 
  it is quite incredible how much the fn can stretch to appeal to completely different demographics and ideologies . 
  especially if you compare it to the far-left , which has always been extremely fragmented over very petty disagreements . 
  on the far-right , the ideological differences are much bigger between royalists , neonazis , gaullists , anti-gaullists from the oas , poujadists , euroskeptic left-wingers , disillusioned communists , anti-islam liberals , pro-israel `` culture clash '' advocates , and even `` antizionist '' minorities . 
  yet le pen father and daughter have managed to keep all those people more or less together for decades . 
   her party was at the forefront of the protests against the introduction of same-sex marriage that 's absolutely wrong . 
  the fn was ( surprisingly from an exterior point of view , but unsurprisingly if you know how many gay people are in its leadership ) very quiet during those protests and refused to participate , contrary to the `` moderate '' right-wing party , which vehemently fought it as if it was the end of the world . 
  the fn officially opposed the reform so as not to alienate a big part of their electorate but it was pretty clear they actually did support the content of the law , which is why they were so embarrassed during the protests . 
  on a side note , almost all of the `` moderate '' right-wing party 's leaders who protested so much against gay marriage did also actually support it in private . 
  i guess it tells a lot about their level of demogagogy . 
   she 's no different to most u.s republicans . 
  she is .

  well if there are pictures of alcohol on the table where rouhani is sitting it could have repercussions for him , making his position even slightly less powerful , which is not something anybody would benefit from in europe . 
  if it was to ban wine from every table in france then i 'd the first to tell them to go kindly fuck themselves , but this is not such a case . 
  in any case , seems they settled for a simple chat so maybe no harm done . 
  well , then i 'll have to disagree with hollande . 
  especially since ( supposedly ) hollande does n't drink alcoholic drinks . 
  also , got a link to what the president said ? 
  i do n't like gremlins thank you very much :p, 
  had never heard of that . 
  just an fyi , it 's `` even worse '' . 
  i do n't think worser exist , but what you wrote would work for others , like '' even greater , smaller and so on . 
  don ' t want to appear arrogant or insult you by the way . 
  what do you mean with your last phrase ? 
  also , you say let them have their land , but the turkish government so far has n't managed to reach an agreement of that type . 
  i am partly a jew and i never , ever heard anything agaonst me or jew that was n't a joke . 
  frankly , i 've been more hurt by comments on me being greek than ma jew , so i find this whole `` france is not safe for jews '' to be on th extreme side . 
  no better option ? 
  is n't hollande for example not a better option in terms of the treatment of jews ? 
  i have n't heard him say anything against you , rather the opposite . 
  i read that the survival elements were heavily watered down , is it true ? 
  well there 's an opinion that turkey is more or less in kurdistan as an occupying force , preventing kurds from reaching their goals , so many see these attacks as liberation attempts . 
  no less terrorism of course , but it 's not black and white . 
  not sure that is sarkozy though . 
  i really do wonder if jupp\u00e9 would be a good president , as a person he strikes me as honourable and decent , working for the interest of his country but will he be so when in power ? 
  they do n't surrender their culture you git , it ' a diplomatic meeting and thus everything must be in the context of diplomacy . 
  but has it gone for the worse ? 
  rouhani has renewed the dialog , ahmadinejad was a fanatic . 
  what does it matter if he is a cleric or a shepherd if he does the right thing for everybody ? 
  if he is more moderate how does . 
  it make him bad ? 
  unless if he has quirks , discriminating towards some groups , but in the end it 's better to be shitty with half the people than with all of them , do n't you think ? 
  from anecdotal evidence i 's doubt about ireland , a friend of my parents almost went to suicide because of how badly treated she was treated and considered by people , at times harassed for no reason . 
  she lived in a village though so that may change things . 
  well there was another commonly accepted truth , every politician is a liar and a thief ... 
  and yet they resonate with a lot of people too . 
  `` greeks love their populism '' i do n't agree with that , most of the people i know are n't fond of it and have voted for populists in the past because they did n't see any other option . 
  that 's how i voted in 2011 or 2012 . 
  if he turns out to be as you say , then goody . 
  what 's your take on potami by the way ? 
  it 's all nice and i mostly agree with him , but how much of what he says is true ? 
  how much of it is `` publicity '' to gain support and just do the same as tsipras and co when or if he takes office ? 
  british shows , not french ( which do n't like often ) : downton abbey , set in 1912 to 1924 following the family life of a lord . 
  the actors are very good imo . 
  misfits : superhero series about some young `` adults '' getting super powers , very fun and not too focused on the powers part and more around the life of the people in question . 
  i expected a shitty series and ended up watching the whole series twice in 2 months . 
  for french stuff i know less , but i love kaamelott , comedy/satyre , sketches that are 5-10 mins long set in the arthurian legend where everybody is stupid or a gumpy . 
  king arthur is the leader of the worse bunch of twits . 
  it kind of reminds the monty python at times too , bein so absurd . 
  do you write political speeches ? 
  because this sure feels like a recited one . 
  thanks for the ping , but as zetzet said , it is a theory , perhaps too extreme to be relevant to us . 
  i think it 'd be better to elaborate on your point , explain , instead of playing the personal attack card . 
  i do n't disagree with you , nor do i agree btw . 
  supposedly that is a misconception , that it originated from france but was popular in belgium . 
  ah , all-right then . 
  oh , i thought that had been done already , since it did go in drydock some time ago . 
  perhaps only a simple revision , or refueling of the reactor . 
  i see . 
  the cdg on drydock ? 
  again ? 
  was n't it in there a couple of years ago ? 
  why though ? 
  if money was taken from your country in the past , should n't it be returned ? 
  perhaps taking money for simplybeing under the soviet leadership is too much , but the soviets did `` steal '' natural ressources . 
  a couple of friends are swiss and they often say that 5-10 minute delays are rather frequently happening . 
  no idea about japan though . 
  because the market was built around the soviet state , regulating everything . 
  too high from my experience . 
  in my class there would be two out of the ten . 
  i ca n't understand why they put in these things lithuania , estonia and other countries of the samz region and not greece , which is larger and in a different location . 
  it would 've been more representative if the data was present imo . 
  oh , greec , italy and spain never had that much ? 
  is that right ? 
  ten years ago greece had in the one million , one in eleven , and turkey with it 's sixty or seventy millions bulk with two three millions ... 
  well that does sound like a threat , does n't it ? 
  do n't see why when eu border countriez said similar things they get scolded and this is now acceptable . 
  in my opinion she should n't had been charged in the first place , but now that she was , to remove the charges seem weak and only enforces her opinion . 
  3,2 eu at lunch in the university restaurant . 
  the problem with romas is that they may tend to be apatride , so they wo n't ever belong anywherr or integrate . that of course is a generalisation , many are n't like that but it is the case of a big chunk of them . 
  it 's said that the greek government was told to lay low on the migrant problem , so i do n't see how the leftist government is at fault there, 
  doubt people would react at white head and i think the change from the original name to be silly politically correct fluff . 
  well to be absolutely exact it 's t\u00eate de n\u00e8gre , but i do n't think it changes much . 
  no idea !, 
  i was never keen on pastries really , excluding those with berries so i would n't know . 
  i think they call them chocolate heads now or something . 
  it sounds a bit silly though in the end . 
  slightly in context , in france there was a pastry called nigger head , but was thought to be offensive so they changed it . 
  well , still better than before having to enjoy their holidays, 
  not in 2033 !, 
  or was it 2034 ? 
  on the other hand having a government that plays the weak partner in the relationship would n't benefit anybody much imo . 
  i think that 's because the european parliament is seen to have little powers and impact , thus not very relevant , perhaps in the same way the community of nations or what was it called was before the war ^ 2 . 
  well , ceausescu did so too , and so did hoxha and yanukovich , it only proves that the permanent is temporary . 
  so they are like the greek communists , they forgot how to say yes and instead use only no . 
  ** escape from new york theme starting **, 
  i was wondering , if one was to say that the number of dead was in fqct lower by l say , two thousand people , and gave the proof ( not yet tested by others tho ) , would he be called a revisionist ? 
  i read your comment wrongly and found out i agree with you . 
  my apologies . 
  maybe . 
  in the context of massacres , like chios , but that 's it . 
  if we start so far back then greece must aek reparations from : venice , france and other crusaders , bulgars and co slavs , mongols , persians/iranians , the various barbarian tribes , germanics and celts , berbers and kabils and tuareg , romans , the people of the sea ( tho that may mean the greeks themselves ) .

  / u/xbettel , why are you pushing macron so hard ? 
  like you said , you do n't even vote here . 
  also , you source of information is very poor . 
  the race is n't a fourway . 
  melenchon is still in the race , bayrou did not said if he will run , fillon may be replaced/cleaned up by justice/give up . 
  so basicaly , it 's still open to plenty of scenario , but you have to be able to listen to french media to know that . 
  you are a really expert . 
  i just happen to look behind the semantic of the words `` running for president '' . 
  yes , / u/pingurambo , he put is little name on the list of the candidate . 
  you are technically right . 
  happy ? 
  now for those wanting a bit more of info on the context , for those who are n't simpleton ; no , he is n't running for president . 
  one house in my street had subvention only because they had a windows made of `` vitraille '' that was considered historical art . 
  i doubt , the one in charge in france , that master the arcannes of it 's law , did n't manage to get some incentive . 
  but indeed , that 's just assumption on my part . 
  castle maintenance is payed by the state if they are classified as monument . 
  when macron will be taken down , we 'll see if you still hold that . 
  if there is no leader , anarchy takes over . 
  i 'm not fancing a new `` terreur '' area . 
  i merely repeated what all the `` politologue '' stated . 
  if you think you know better than professional , suit yourself . 
  this election is a roller coaster . 
  all the front runner are taken down one by one . 
  just for the poor european jumping into our bottomless political pit . 
  hamon is not running for president , but the lead of the partie socialist ( ps ) . 
  so he address the core of his voter , not the french . 
  those whole like to dream big and then get smashed by the wall of reality . 
  those idea are merely flagship for a vision of france that will never happen . 
  i mean , if it comes down to this , why even keep ireland in the eu ? 
  play by the rule , or get the fuck out . 
  i wish it was that simple for us too . 
  we do n't have any sort of `` special '' relationship . 
  not questioning your experience . 
  i 'm questioning your honesty . 
  my post was pretty clear about it and you would have seen it if you did n't have head up your ass up to the nationalist nerve . 
  i 'm in . 
  it 's been to long since we roasted some british eggs . 
  she played the hand delt to her , a pretty shitty one . 
  she all-in with last early election and it failed . 
  everyone must remember , british put themselves in this position . 
  hottest ladies *, 
  i could report you for supporting nazism . 
  it would be fun to see mods ' take on that . 
  im pretty sur they can make you stop talking by a simple ban . 
  in the mean time i 'll just block you . 
  that will be about the same . 
   you 're never gon na stop people expressing their views . 
  look that just what german 's police did . 
  peace retard, 
  1 / im not saying you are american . 
  i said the argument was . 
  2 / i have full knowledge of history and french/us relation . 
  enough to know that our definition of liberty is very different . 
  3 / you are ** again ** talking about opinion when ** no opinion ** was even mention by anybody . 
  there is no beneficial situation where tolerating demonstration of nazism is acceptable . 
  peace retard . 
  xd yes . 
  calling someone retarded is punishable by law . 
  also , what opinion are you talking about ?!? 
  they did n't express an opinion . 
  those dude did some stupid shit and like we say : do stupid shit , get hits . 
  also , the `` this is a slippery slope , and you do n't want the government taking away people 's freedom like this . '', 
  argument makes my eyes roll so hard . 
  not even worth arguying about that classic bullshit american argument . 
  stop defending stupid statement . 
  germany has historically a particuliar reaction to anything nazi related . 
  you have to be retarded to try to justify what that dude did . 
   you do n't want the government taking away people 's freedom like this muhhh freedoooom . 
  just saying , in my country you can order a [ neger 's head ] ( https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/t%c3%aate-de-n%c3%a8gre_ ( p % c3 % a2tisserie \\ ) ) and that 's the best think to have a bit on . 
  not sur it would be possible in the us though . 
  different country do things differently, 
  fucking / u/lolfish42 killing all the fun for us . 
  they gain from being bigger . 
  by next century china will return to it 's 1st rank and europe will be the second biggest area . 
  i 'm pretty sur you are the one full of shit . 
  you most likely try to make your particular case a generality when it 's clearly is n't . 
  who the fuck is asking himself `` what hospital should i go to ? '', 
  during an ** emergency ** . 
  you realize that if this is true . 
  your kids will be chinese 's slaves . 
  yeah , but thatfact means shit until you draw conclusion from it . 
  and here the ** wrong ** conclusion to make here is the shortcut `` you have higher standard of living in the us '' . 
  you used to have plain full of wilderness , and now this . 
  nobody was into anyone . 
  we just have the chance to have 4 party to chose rather than two like we used to, 
  way more than 50 % came to vote, 
  the media didnt campain against melenchon . 
  you must be mixing him up with fillon, 
  you mix up communism and socialism, 
  yeah , because everyone goes to very particular place like the rambla or the park g\u00fcell . 
  but who gives a fuck about the 95 % of the streets ? 
  nobody , outside the old town , barcelona is ugly as fuck . 
  i lived in barcelona like i wrote a couple post ago . 
  for someone so `` educated '' you sure seems to have either memory or reading problems . 
  you are just taking it in your nationalist nerve , like most catalan usualy do . 
  god forbide you receive a critic !, 
  dude . 
  that 's blocks of concrete . 
  the first turd ever made was still a turd . 
  what ?

  on the one hand , the greek government see poor children living on its soil , so they want to give them a proper education . 
  other countries are doing the same thing , either in europe or in jordan for example . 
  on the other hand , the parents of those children just want to improve the life of their children , which is why they would like them to receive an education . 
  you would probably do the same thing in the same situation . 
  they ca n't give this education to their children themselves , so they try to get it from the power that could . 
  yes , the article talks a lot about those children 's health , but does n't say much about whether they speak greek or not , which should be the main concern before going to school in a typical local greek school . 
  even if they stay in europe , they are obviously not planning to stay in greece . 
  as stated in the article :  the lessons will be in greek , math and english , or another language , depending on where the refugees plan to travel on to . 
  it 's easy to understand `` german '' instead of `` another language '' . 
   why ca n't asylum seeker parents be given supplies so they can home school their kids or organise into small groups to do so ? 
  because you have to be educated yourself in the first place to be able to school your own kids . 
  it 's not a problem of supplies . 
  education levels were already not that high on average in syria , albeit improving before the war , are worse in iraq and abysmal in the likes of afghanistan or somalia . 
  also , the highly educated people from those countries that fled are n't in those refugee camps usually , because they fled before the rest or had higher means . 
   they are now hitting the middle income trap , and so far they have done a bad job getting around it . 
  china is an outlier though because of its size and recent history . 
  even if the country as a whole looks middle income , there are municipalities that have reached high level income ( municipalities that are bigger than most european countries ) , thus avoiding the middle income trap , and provinces that are still very poor , well below the middle income level . 
  they also have companies that are managing pretty well the transition between cheap and counterfeited goods to real innovation , like huawei . 
  countries stucked in the middle income trap ( brazil , south africa , argentina , indonesia ... ) do n't know this phenomenon , whereas the countries that did avoid the trap ( like south korea ) did . 
  but i do n't think that you could define democratic socialism like that anyway because you would have a hard time distinguishing this with a practice like using a public service delegation contract , which can be used by many kinds of government . 
  `` democratic socialism '' used to be about wanting to establish socialism through democratic means , by winning elections and making progressive reforms toward socialism , including mainly the social ownership of the means of production . 
  it was opposed to reaching socialism through revolution and violent means , but the end goal was the same . 
  nowadays , even if many newspapers try to describe corbyn like this , which he is n't , this view is basically dead or powerless in europe . 
  `` social democracy '' on the other hand is different , because it is n't about establishing socialism , but softening capitalism by promoting social and economic interventions by the state to improve social justice and efficiency in the economy . 
  of course , social democracy also requires democratic institutions . 
  european countries with their welfare states can be considered as social democracies . 
  sometimes they can act by doing what you said , but it 's not the only way to operate . 
  for example , the social democratic state can , in order to heal poor people or everybody , subsidize private hospitals ( as you said ) . 
  it can also operate public hospitals itself ( like the uk with the nhs ) , or even do both things at the same time . 
  according to your definition , the [ bush government ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/emergency_economic_stabilization_act_of_2008 ) was democratic socialist . 
  exactly , he did n't do a bad job . 
  but a former bodybuilder and action movie hero should be the kind of strange candidate in his party , not the most reasonable one . 
  immigrants are inflating london property prices so much that hungarians should n't go there . 
  he 's not a reporter though . 
  that 's a satirical show . 
  they usually try to get interviews with politicians but ask stupid questions in order to mock them . 
  they lost their press cards 4 years ago because they obviously were n't reporting news . 
  i do n't know if they managed to get them back . 
  the two-party system does n't go along well with such a huge and [ growing polarization ] ( http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/06/12/7-things-to-know-about-polarization-in-america/ ) . 
  trump is n't the first fringe one , he 's just the most successful fringe one so far , but someone like sarah palin for example would n't have been better at all . 
  when you think that it 's annoying that , for the sanity and reasonableness of your political system and institutions , [ this guy ] ( http://i.onionstatic.com/avclub/4168/92/16x9/960.jpg ) was n't born in the us , you have a huge problem . 
  the problem is bigger than just the number of people that believe in creationism . 
  even among the majority of people , in our countries , that reject bullshit like creationism , most of them merely `` believe '' in evolution . 
  instead of believing , they should understand , at least basically , how evolution works . 
  but ask around yourself , in school or at work or in family , and you 'll see that most people do n't even have a basic grasp on how it works . 
  even a decent part of the people that received higher education ( not in biology of course ) do n't have a decent grasp on evolution . 
  they just `` believe '' in evolution because they were taught evolution in school , did n't learn much about it except the name and its importance , but that 's what smart people and specialists also seem to believe , and you are classified as an idiot if you do n't , so they follow the trend . 
  it 's a shame that people do n't get such kind of basic knowledge after spending at least 15 years in school . 
  the same thing could be said about global warming . 
  actually , europeans mostly use cars to go downhill . 
  i ca n't find a single reliable and independant source to support this claim . 
  the [ financial times ] ( https://www.ft.com/content/3e0172a0-6e1b-11e6-9ac1-1055824ca907 ) also explains , among many other sources , that :  `` at the root of political concern in washington is anxiety that profits are held abroad by us companies . 
  in theory at least , forcing apple to pay back taxes to ireland ** would reduce the pool of money ** that ** might ultimately be taxed in the us ** . '', 
  this is completely different than stating that the us taxpayer will pay apple 's taxes to the eu instead of apple . 
  the only source is the us government itself and apple , and the way it has been worded makes it obvious that it 's not the case but had just been said to cast doubt on the issue and get the support of the us citizen . 
  for example , the white house spokesman josh earnest said that : `` it 's also possible that the kinds of payments that were contemplated by the eu decision today at the end of the day are merely a transfer of revenue from u.s. taxpayers to the eu . 
  i think that is the crux of our concerns about the fairness of this kind of approach . 
  they ca n't claim money that should be paid by apple-ireland on apple-usa 's tax returns unless they bring back this offshore money into the us before paying in ireland . 
  they wo n't bring this money back unless us tax code is modified . 
  this [ article ] ( http://www.forbes.com/sites/janetnovack/2016/09/13/no-u-s-taxpayers-wont-pay-apples-14-5-billion-irish-tax-bill/#73875cc513af ) explains it well :  other u.s. officials and commentators -- with the encouragement of apple ceo tim cook ( see his open letter here ) -- have also adopted the line that the $ 13 billion payment , if upheld , will fall on american taxpayers and not on apple and its shareholders . 
   is that really true ? 
   the argument that u.s. taxpayers will pay might sound legally correct , but it is misleading , since it ignores what 's really been happening and is likely to happen on the u.s. tax front . 
  ( that 's just one part of the article , it goes into details after and is worth the read . ), 
  the us wants it both ways : taxing profits made in the us by both us and foreign companies , and taxing profits made abroad by us companies . 
  you can do that if you want to , but foreign countries do n't have to accept lower taxes paid to them by us companies for profits earned on their soil because they also have to pay taxes in the us . 
  that would be a preferential treatment for us companies . 
   apple gave money in the first place for us taxes paid . 
  they did n't paid taxes on money earned abroad . 
  they kept the money in their offshore bank accounts . 
  the us government never saw that money . 
  look at this [ cnn article ] ( http://money.cnn.com/2016/04/14/news/tax-us-companies-offshore-cash/ ) about offshore cash . 
   the new oxfam report shows that apple holds the most money offshore of any major u.s. company , at $ 181 billion . 
  apple ceo tim cook said in december that he would `` love to '' repatriate apple 's foreign profits but that he ca n't because `` it would cost me 40 % . '', 
  the 40 % refers to the combined u.s. federal and state tax rate apple would likely owe . 
   at the time , forget the west in the us , it was n't under control . 
  same for canada . 
  and for the same kind of historical reasons , forget eastern europe in the eu because they were n't in the union when brussels became the capital . 
  the us and canada never had to change the location of their capitals after their expansion toward the west . 
  why should the eu change the location of its capital after its expansion toward the east ? 
  also , in terms of demography , vienna is n't much more in the center of the eu than brussels , despite the uk leaving . 
  about 3/4 of the eu 's population live westward of vienna and 1/4 live eastward . 
  sure , eastern europe is nothing like siberia in comparison to western russia , but it still has a significantly smaller population than western europe . 
  so trump would start again with the delian league . 
  he 's the new pericles . 
  they share the same statemanship . 
  the way government and politics work in belgium already almost gives de facto to brussels a situation similar to washington dc . 
  the european project was n't just about economy , even at the beginning . 
  it started out after ww2 to prevent wars between european countries , mainly germany and france , by merging industries that were needed to wage a war : coal and steel . 
  that 's why the first industries concerned were n't agricultural products or the textile industry or whatever . 
  it was in 1952 . 
  economy was used as a mean to an end , which was peace . 
  at exactly the same time was proposed the european defence community , with a plan proposed in 1950 and a treaty signed in 1952 . 
  it collapsed when it failed to obtain ratification in the french parliament in 1954 . 
  anyway , the idea is n't new and is actually much older than the current eu itself . 
  the two treaties of rome signed in 1957 established the european economic community ( eec ) and the european atomic energy community . 
  they have been ratified quickly after this time . 
  in the preamble it declares that the signatories are : `` determined to lay the foundations of an ever closer union among the peoples of europe '' . 
  the way the eu is going is exactly the same since the beginning . 
  without the uk , it 's very probable that the eu would have much more power today . 
  the need to have a central location for the capital is a strange argument .

  going without insurance being btw qualified suicide since only the emergency room will agree to see you in case of trouble ( then the 5 figure bill will follow you for the next years to come ) . 
   so still if i was doing what im doing now in usa , i would be alot richer than im now and even discarding those 2 sticky points and extrapolating you were right ( you arent . 
  ) ; a 1800  2300 certainly does n't qualify as `` x10 '' . 
   i run those numbers so many times so i know well , might i suggest getting into touch with your futur insurance & credit providers then ? 
  because they might have not told you the entire truth . 
  we do n't have death penalty here even and even if we were in country where there is ; it would be near impossible to prove he deserves it either way ( e.g : violent prisonner that both commited known war crimes & can not be reintegrated in society ) . 
  on the other hand he probably deserves decades in jail , yes . 
   being a co-owner of transport company in usa/canada earns your more , hence lower taxes and other shit and the rent is like 2000 % higher , so is the food ; there is no healthcare if you do n't buy an insurance that costs you a kidney with that kind of income ( expect 600 $ / mo ) ; electricity is several hundreds $ a month if you live in california or the eastern cost etc ( let alone mandatory air cooling/heater in half the state that twice or thrice it , with the crazy weather there ) . 
  so , instead of being richer , you 'd pay a lot more and just have a slight difference . 
  ( oh and seriously , never break any bone in the usa , or it means filling bankruptcy or finding tens to hundreds of thousands of $ ) . 
   if i was doing the same im doing in europe in usa i would get 10 times more money lol . 
  you remind me of those refugees that came in germany thinking they could get by with working 5h per week . 
  once you account for price differences , imho you might have a slight increase in lifestyle but that 's it . 
  well , to their credit , refugees did n't picked where they were born . 
  joigning daesh however is a 100 % willfull act and problably somwhere around `` high treason '' imho . 
   their ideas , in the tradition of aldous huxleys brilliant book `` brave new world '' . 
  annnnnd there 's our first disguised godwin point . 
   what turn of events caused people from kosovo to come to bavaria in such large numbers that they constitute 40 percent of the migrants there ? 
  that 's indeed ~ ~ curious ~ ~ important ; it 's nowhere near syria or the thirdworld , or even any warzone since decades . 
  it probably worth looking what 's causing them to flee the country . 
   illegal , we 've tried and it 's illegal under international law . 
  well , looks like we 'll have to ignore that law a bit : / libya 's half lawless either way right now . 
   we should rescue them but at the same time it encourages them to try knowing if they have a chance of being rescued . 
  take them back and destroy their boats . 
  agreed, 
   why is them winning so dangerous ? 
  well , to put it into perspective they did human hunts for fun ( as in `` the ultimate danger game '' ) . 
  lots of their members are in jail over serious violence ( assaults , beatings , blackmail , mafia practice & `` protection business '' , industrial-level theft , etc etc ) . 
  oh and they are openly actual nazis . 
  the germany-in-1940 kind . 
  they have 15 % quiet support in reality in greece . 
  it 's still quite dangerous . 
  well they had the fsb clean up the vk profile of soldiers who went in ukraine so it 's not outlandish they 'd do the same in syria . 
  i 'd be more surprized they 'd refuse to go in syria tho , there 's no risk of going against nato or bs backstab invasion war . 
   ok guys , we 've solved it !, 
  the problem is ( yet again ) greece !, 
  no , but it 'll be time to turn back volumes that make it daily back to turkey i guess : / send back anyone that does n't show syrian papers ?

  agreed ; it 'd help reduce immigration flows to more manageable levels . 
   and sputnik news . 
  that one is real propaganda . 
  do not know about deutsche well on the other hand . 
   , us , russian or assad , but somebody has to go in . 
  yeah , russian ones would do best . 
  assad is blocked away but the nusrais/fsa , and america would be the eternal invader . 
   there has to be boots on the ground obviously special forces & spotters etc , but the bulk of the army is staying home i meant . 
  if there was an us or russian division on the ground crushing them , we 'd hear about it . 
   for obvious reason i know , his life is in danger , but it means that at least for me , having no access to classified information as a civilian it 'll probably be declassified after the wars . 
  it 's less him that is in danger and more of his immediate family . 
  you know how north korean defectors avoir revealing their real names to avoid shipping their family to gulag ? 
  yeah . 
   that makes the report untrustworthy . 
  well , i know from errh second hand that the tadmur prison was just as bad for a fact , so it 's sadly all too trustworthy to me . 
   granted yugoslavia was never really totalitarian to the full i 'm sorry but tito was a puppy next to what went under saddam or staline . 
   although daily mail is n't the best source , i plead guilty haha all my sources at hand were in french and i did n't thought it would be as interesting if you could ` nt read it directly ( e.g : http://www.lemonde.fr/international/article/2014/12/02/alois-brunner-criminel-nazi-a-jamais-impuni_4532946_3210.html )  assad is far from perfect , your regime torturing to death tens of thousands of people generally disqualify you for that . 
  and that 's ignoring the entire civil war . 
   but he is probably the fastest way to peace if he does n't torture to death rebels after signing peace . 
  ergo , his secret prison system must be provenly dismantled ( like the cws ) . 
   because that same secret police is the best tool for keeping extremists like isis and al nusra under control . 
  about that , uh . 
  how to put it . 
  the fall of tadmur was not just a strategic failure alone ; it was also at least partly due to unchecked daesh cells everywhere in the town and an army in extremely poor shape too . 
   this is more than a civil war , this is a proxy war between russia and the us . 
  if only . 
  the main us closest thing to a proxy in the south is quiet ( the sf ) ; the kurds in the north are n't interested to really go beyond their borders ( rojava ) ; and the moderates in idlib/aleppo are overpowered by nusra . 
  then there is that division 30th disaster . 
  and despite overwhelming air superiority , the coalition is not touching assad at all . 
  so if the us wanted to use syria to annoy russia , they did it very badly . 
   nd us wants isis to take him down uh , no . 
  the mission was to take on isis actually but without boots on the ground . 
  and it failed , due to the fsa being way too weak . 
  in fact , the coalition remains in syria nearly exclusively to bomb daesh ( the second side objective was to protect rojava/krg but that bit is mostly fullfilled )  so they can come in and clean up the mess . 
  well , obviously i ca n't really talk for the us proper , but i 'd love for russia to actually come in and clean the daesh mess , but that 's just me . 
  that way the usa/coalition could keep avoiding putting troops in syria outside of rojava . 
   meaning it has to do with the civil war yes and no . 
  it 's the bit they can prove . 
  caesar ( a former employee of one of those sites ) used the civil war to defect in the ambiant chaos ( and probably because he was shocked by barrel bombings of civilian neighborhoods as collective punishment , i think ) , which is why they got pictures & inside info of this area during this time . 
   people never got jailed for jokes errrrh . 
  actually it suspiciously looked like the saddam or staline era terror from what i heard ; probably because the system was built by afez al assad ( bashar 's father ) with soviet help & by recruiting ex nazis & kgb interrogators & similar personnal after wwii ( stuff like that : http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2863568/from-hitler-assad-one-world-s-wanted-nazis-secretly-employed-syria-agent-terror.html ) . 
  if saddam did it , the assad regime probably did it too ( with or without the complicity of bashar ) . 
   hopefully there will be a ceasefire . 
  agreed, 
   letting their women and children get hide and get killed while they 're fleeing for europe as i understand it , for the moment latakia & damascus proper are n't too much shelled ; so they take the risk . 
  however since the gov weaken they do n't have a lot of time . 
  and heading north towards turkey is now dangerous because they have to pass throught isis or nusra territory in a lot of case . 
   problem with fighting an irregular army is that all the enemies are technically civilians since they wear no uniforms . 
  we 're not talking about soldiers going rampant who commited war crimes here . 
  we 're talking about a dozen `` blacksites '' country wide , where suspected dissidents that made a joke about the president are disappeared by the local kgb-trained secret police , and where their family follow them frequently a few weeks laters . 
  it 's an organized system a la gulag . 
  if you ever heard about the infamous tadmur prison , you will probably understand what i 'm talking about . 
   if fsa is not al nusra or isis then the 20 year old men can fight for the fsa . 
  right now i think a cease fire between the saa & fsa & forcing the gov to close it 's secret prisons would probably be the best option to end the massacre . 
   source ? 
  https://www.reddit.com/r/syriancivilwar/comments/3797zy/saa_soldier_serving_3_years_past_his_mandatory/ and a few hungry soldiers near tadmur before it fell makes me suspect it 's similar in a lot of areas . 
  edit : they probably made some progress since but i suspect even western or russian food rations looks like haute cuisine next to it . 
   and what happens to their women and children in syria while they 're gone . 
  hiding , most of the time . 
   source ?

  never a bad plan tbh, 
  i agree with everything you 've said . 
  they go around respecting women as human beings in every country on the face of the earth , really it 's a disgrace . 
  of course noone read the article . 
   `` the aim is not to transform the army into people shooting in the streets anywhere anytime , but on the contrary to fix a framework both to secure safety in case of a terror attack and define key democratic controls . '' there are already soldiers guarding important monuments and administrations , under the vigipirate plan since 2003 . 
  the soldiers are not doing police work , they can not arrest anyone , they 're merely there to act as dissuasion for potential terrorists , and they 're only allowed to shoot in self defense . 
  the new law would refine their rules of engagement , including giving them the ability to shoot in defense of someone else under certain circumstances . 
  agreed . 
  exactly . 
  i agree with all of that , but still , most news outlets forecasted a clinton win . 
  that 's a strong word , but he was n't very popular by the end of his first term . 
  that 's exactly what they said about trump , and look at where we are now . 
   she might only win against sarkozy because he is that hated agreed . 
  people chose chirac over le pen senior , but marine is less hated than her father , and sarkozy is more hated than chirac was . 
   but do n't you see that you are forcing them to make that choice instead of just accepting the fact that they have a different belief system than you ? 
  noone is having second thoughts about forcing me to make a choice about my naruto headband . 
  because noone cares about my naruto headband and my stubborn refusal to remove it for five minutes . 
  rightfully so . 
  why do people care about the headscarf but not the naruto headband ? 
  they care about the headscarf because of the magical intangible being . 
  all i 'm saying is that a magical intangible being should n't even be a factor in a secular state . 
   you 're being no different than the people that fight against gay marriage or legalized marijuana . 
  to the countrary . 
  i 'm saying that people 's belief system should n't be relevant to policy making , only objective fact . 
  and it is an objective fact that the legislation for passports ( in france at least ) requires hair to be untied , and ears to be visible . 
   these are women that want to travel the world they still could . 
  they would just need to remove their hat for the picture and to talk to the border official . 
  just like everyone else does . 
   we are n't discussing adding an exception , we are discussing the idea of removing it . 
  i 'm not expecting the exception to be removed , i just think it 's stupid to have it in the first place . 
   and they wo n't do that . 
  it 's their choice . 
  not anyone else 's . 
  they decide that keeping the hat is more important than freedom of travel . 
  no one is making that decision for them . 
   but it is not up to us to decide what is important to these people . 
  you 're right , it 's not up to the state to decide what 's important to these people . 
  it is however up to the state to decide what facial features are important when determining someone 's identity and physical likeness . 
   prevent their ability to travel over something as insignificant as the ability to see their hair . 
  they 're not being prevented to travel . 
  the hat is n't glued on , it just needs to be removed to take the picture and while talking to the border officials . 
  if some people would rather stop traveling than do these things , it is their problem , not the government . 
   if you 're trying to get me to admit that wearing hijabs in general is stupid no , i 'm trying to get you to admit that allowing something on a passport for the sole reason that a * magical intangible being * told someone to wear it through a book is stupid . 
  wether the being in question is called god or flying spaggeti monster does n't change anything to that fact . 
  fine , then switch the naruto headband for a spaghetti strainer in my previous argument . 
  people have actually been allowed to wear it on official document . 
  is it not still stupid ? 
  then we agree , the exception for the hijab is just as stupid as an hypothetical exception for the naruto headband would be . 
  but then we 're back to the naruto headband . 
  the only difference is the magical intangible being , and i do n't think that should be an argument in a secular state . 
  i understand your argument about equity vs egality , and i agree with you . 
  i also agree that the whole headscarf thing is backwards and sexist , but that 's not what we 're discussing . 
  the thing is , identity does n't have anything to do with biometrics . 
  a passport is about biometrics and making sure you can identify a person from a picture . 
  it 's all it is about . 
  it 's not a tumblr `` about '' section . 
  it 's not supposed to express the way you see your identity . 
  it 's supposed to help secure borders and the flow of people . 
  and the argument about preventing people from traveling just does n't make sense . 
  they could still travel just as easily as before , they just have to get a new picture taken . 
  if they do n't want to and would rather stop traveling , it 's a choice they 're free to make , but do n't pretend it 's not a choice . 
  the hat is not sewn on anyone 's head . 
  if anyone choses to prioritise the hat over traveling , they can , but do n't pretend anyone but themselves is making that choice . 
  to be fair i 'm talking about the guidelines for a french passport because that 's the only ones i know , so you 're right , it 's going to vary for any country . 
  the elephant is physically unable to climb the tree . 
  noone is physically unable to remove a hat . 
  the guidelines for a passport photo include the fact that your hair ca n't be held back or tied , and that your ears must be visible . 
  the headscarf is clearly in violation of these guidelines . 
  i do n't see how `` identity '' should have any bearing on these very specific guidelines . 
  she would be forced to take it off to take her passport picture . 
  why is the cap different than the headscarf ? 
   because they want fair treatment with respect to their culture but they do n't get fair treatment . 
  fair treatment is `` everyone removes all headwear from their passport picture '' . 
  they get special treatment , special treatment is `` everyone removes all headwear from their passport picture , except in the case that a magical intangible being told you to wear that headwear '' . 
   denying them the passport on these grounds prevents them from traveling and enjoying the world beyond their country they can just do what everyone else does and remove the headwear . 
   it just seems like a sad waste of our time making this an issue . 
  there are lots of more pressing issues in the world , agreed . 
  however we 're discussing it at the moment , not those other issues . 
   i see enough of the face to identify the person you could still identify me if i wore a baseball cap , or a naruto headband . 
  but i 'm not allowed to wear those on my passport picture . 
  what 's the difference ? 
  because of all the reason to wear a hat on a picture , the only one that the secular western states see as valid is `` an intangible magical being told me to through a book '' . 
  it makes sense . 
  rekt, 
  but it does n't matter , if you do n't `` actualise '' every month you get kicked off p\u00f4le emploi . 
  so either way they 're out of the unemployment stats, 
   they should segregate refugees by ethnicity that 'll go over well lol, 
  so happy they arrested ( at least one of ) the perpetrator ( s ) . 
  he does n't get to take the easy way out , he does n't get to be a martyr . 
  he does however get to answer for his crime in court , that way at least the victim 's family can have ( some ) closure . 
  love the second picture , you 'd expect him to be the one checking out her ass , but nope, 
  i found out on cara delevingne 's instagram :\\ ^ ), 
  wiko phones are pretty shit , they seem good but do n't last long in my experience . 
  archos makes pretty good phones though . 
  true , i do n't know where i read that france was second behind the us , and i ca n't find it now , so yeah , you 're right . 
  i 'm just saying , that graph is slightly misleading . 
  that 's misleading , all of france 's nukes might not be on ballistic missiles or airlaunched missiles , but they 're in submarines , ready to be launched nonetheless . 
  those are numbers of warheads though . 
  true , what 's important is the ability to deliver the nukes , not the number of nukes , and our submarines give us that ability . 
  i just thought i saw a good oportunity to wave my country 's epeen around and took it .

  now he 's busy building mosques everywhere on state money , turkish nato weapons appear in nusra ( al qaeda ) 's hands ( and no i 'm not talking about theft ) , journalists jailed on a weekly basis , corruption state backed and that kind of dinosaure comments are recurrent . 
   eu is in deep shit , it 's not the shiny union it was , it 's crumbling even when `` crumbling '' we have a hundred time your economy and still have a bigger gdp than the usa . 
   that the majority of turkish citizens do n't even support joining the eu of course , and iran was so much more happy under embargo singing `` death to america and israel ! '' . 
  most of it yes . 
  which is why parts of the middle east and africa are still a hell hole . 
  corruption 's the main problem just behind the invasion ; that much is clear . 
  and that part is very much an ukrainian-sourced problem, 
  if you want the blunt truth ; this , turkey ( edit : i mean the gov ) , is why people are n't willing to see you in europe . 
  your religious extremist fundamentalist views straight ouf the medieval dark ages a thousand years in the past . 
  the rest of the world moved on from that , so please do the same with extreme religion and such prehistoric views . 
  edit : good points too from a turkish redditor : https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4a18cw/turkish_first_lady_praises_ottomanera_harem_for/d0wx4ef?context=3 it 's possible the article was n't entirely honest in retranscribing their words, 
  what word would you use instead ? 
  must be like christmas for the intelligence community edit : word, 
   i did n't , the majority of greeks hate turks - i believe any greek here can confirm that for me . 
  non greek here but the golden dawn i had the displeasure to watch are basically the greek equivalent of the turkish grey wolves ( it 's the name they give to themselves , no joke ) . 
  fanatics . 
  they thankfully do n't represent most greeks as of now ; and the guy got expelled as punishment for the racist insults, 
  no , as usual they want to sacrifice unemployment & pension & welfare money to pay the demands of that medef tax frauder millionaire lobbyist named gattaz . 
  i 'm kind of highly disgusted by the whole thing . 
  they basically want to make greece ii with us without even the debts just to enrich more the guy & his cronies who pretend he 'll `` create more jobs '' in exchange for those 35 ' 000 ' 000 ' 000 $ and that it might depending on their mood `` trickle down in the economy '' . 
  i see the whole thing as corruption & theft at that point ( a 35b annual hold up ) ; but obviously most people in the gov seems to disagree . 
  yeah most of the `` magic '' is basically happening in budget spreadsheets trying to make numbers go round, 
   taxes today across the developed world are much higher than they were in the immediate post-war period . 
  they would be , [ if every single company with any amount of money was n't using an off shore shell company system to evade them all ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-20580545 ) , up to and including vat a couple years ago . 
  nowadays , only citizens and small business with nobody to handle the paper work pay them honestly . 
  po boxes in ~ ~ luxembourg ~ ~ switzerland , ~ ~ monaco ~ ~ or bahamas etc is the rule for the largest part of corporate cash flows : [ facebook paid # 4,327 corporation tax in 2014 ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/business-34504474 ), 
  yeah . 
  but i still do n't know how the government imagine they 'll find those * additionnal * 35 billions euro they decided to give to the medef each years , by the end of the year, 
  it 's not the inflation or germany 's fiscality that worries me the most right now but the ps 's ( france 's party in power ) retarded `` work law '' that vandalize our work code that they try pushing right now . 
  ( a law that basically says that they do n't have to pay taxes anymore in a lot of cases - not that they did n't frauded them already but it 's now legal ... - ; that abolish sunday and make it another work day , that encourage employers to ask you to come working at night ( but your 're not paid more for any of that work . 
  ) , enormously rise maximal length on work shifts at like 48h de facto , etc. 
  there have already been petitions of 1.5 + millions protestors , 2m in the streets and the minister which they force pushing it has so much pression she has constant seizures and 3 hospitalisations in 10 days ; but nooo our gov decided they would offer that law and yet another additionnal 35 ' 000 ' 000 ' 000 $ a year of tax breaks to employers lobbies ; great / s f ` in neoliberalism, 
   even-though european government spends an ever increasing portion of the tax payers money we stagnate . 
  probably because they only spend it on people who do n't need it , like megacorps getting subsidies and corrupt defense spending with 99 % + margins and where tanks are sold 1500x their value ( i mean , when the french navy can buy a stealth frigate for the price the greeks bought a single tank to a certain country , you have a problem . ) . 
   while most european governments run a unsustainable budget deficit probably if we cutted those corporate subsidies and corruption as a start that 'd help ? 
   france have had a 30 years continuous budget deficit - this is n't merely a unsustainable but also a generational theft . 
  actually the deficit was frequently below inflation . 
  at our current point where running a defacto less than 2 % deficit once you count in the fact that we 're borrowing money at a * negative * rate . 
  ( then there 's the fact that we are bankrolling like 6 countries under the table and a big part of the eu budget . 
  once that 's not going to be a problem in a decade or so because other countries like spain or ireland finally recover ... ), 
  3b extra is nearly reasonable , alright . 
  we should pay it i think, 
   abolish minimum wage , social security and pensions , ban trade unions and we can become competitive again overnight . 
  then you have a 50 $ / month wage , medecine still costs thousands , and first thing serious you are dead . 
  and it 's going to be painfull because you ca n't even afford tylenol . 
  oh and [ do n't forget to come back saturday at 3:00 am or you are fired and we replace you with a pakistani or african for half that ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/amazon-used-neo-nazi-guards-to-keep-immigrant-workforce-under-control-in-germany-8495843.html ) ( thankfully it was before germany reinstated minimal wage ), 
  i 'm totally convinced by your well rounded argument . 
  pray tell , how would the economy have recovered in europe if the marshall plan money was never distributed ? 
  it could n't had . 
  how would poland be an economic powerhouse now if the eu never had lended them hundreds of billions of tax money at every level ? 
  it could n't had . 
  was poland caught up in any recent war ? 
   the baby boom happened because huge amounts of money were being spent rebuilding economies after the war . 
  furthermore , many economies were operating very efficiently , again , due to the war . 
  it 's less the war and more that the gov was willing to spend money paying people and actually collect taxes on the wealthy to run said reconstruction programs . 
  they could have paid them to do anything else and avoided the war and it would have ben the same . 
  but now the gov paying people is called `` communism '' or `` lazy mooching '' or `` parasits looking for a handout '' and taxation of capital `` theft '' by some very wealthy people who write the law at the senate ( who subsequently give instead all that money to their wealthy buddies as `` subsidies '' ) . 
  well looking at how turkey managed to build quite decent camps on very little money [ with prefab ] ( http://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/78/590x/secondary/turkey-367889.jpg ) ; i 'm sure we could do better than `` some crappy '' without ruining them . 
  there 's no reasons the eu ca n't give them a hand with logistics . 
  but agreed, 
   eu should be pouring billions into greece to help them cover the costs of camps agreed . 
  we might as well give remaining money to greece to run those . 
  it 'd boost a bit of their economy to some degree at least . 
   you assume those gorillas are smart enough to default the loans , let alone knowing what a default is . 
  yet that 's part of what they announced : http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/greece/11741814/golden-dawn-mp-furiously-tears-up-papers-in-parliament-over-bailout-deal.html it 's easy to simply underestimate them as `` apes '' but that 's dangerous too, 
   so what are they going to do about it ? 
  voting [ golden dawn ] ( http://www.channel4.com/media/images/channel4/c4-news/2013/september/28/28_goldendawn_g_w.jpg ) , which will restore their beloved greek right wing junta from the 70 's & abolish democraty ; junta which will promptly default on you . 
  the point is to keep them alive and well . 
  she ca n't do that if she loose her post or they run out of political good will at home . 
  mostly in germany ; in france our middle east immigrants tend to speak arabic instead when they do n't speak the local language ( or english ) . 
  but sure why not ; as a french i 'd not be opposed to the idea of making it another official eu language . 
  what do the other countries think of the demand ? 
  but ignoring too much the will of the population could lead to a bit of social instability & your downfall mme merkel ; and if you loose your post you wo n't be able to help much more people . 
   why they do n't like france ? 
  french is an annoyingly hard language to learn for a lot of people and you need to register and go in system ( and then the uk will deport them to france on sight if caught in the uk without a valid visa/passport/authorization ) ; and they can get slightly more money in the uk and already speak english and have family there . 
  so they 'd rather attempt as illegal in the uk in a number of cases . 
  the border getting closed , ongoing dismantling of the camp and the uk turning them back slowly change their mind and remove some of the pull tho . 
   it 's like clearing a campsite of 3,500 aggressive and hostile people . 
  you 're halving the real number ( about 7000 ), 
   more compatible with human rights is towing ships back to their point of origin : australia succeeded with this method . 
  that would also work yes ; wonder why we 're not doing it at that point : / turkey 's largely safe too , and that could help calm a large amount of pressure on merkel currently . 
  well if the us with all their ressources still ca n't find el chapo or dismantle the mexican cartels , it means it 's going to be even harder for us ; especially with the north african mafia having a serious hand in marseilles ( let alone talking about the italian one in italy ), 
  when there is 30 % unemployment in `` banlieux '' ( poortown suburbs ) no there is n't always that option . 
  and of the 60 % that work for a part it 's more like a part time so it 's more 400 $ . 
  when lucky enough to have long term job . 
  so of course if they can get as much per day from the mafia peddling coke ... edit : 30 % unemployment there sorry , just checked  but what is a borring job barrely offering 1000 $ / month when drug dealing gives you that much within 3 or 4 days of `` work '' ... pretty much . 
  so pushing them to legalization and rising wages in other jobs/offering welfare would go quite a bit to fight the problem . 
  well that 's exactly why it 's so prevalent in poor suburb . 
  a lot deal drug because there 's no legit way for a lot of youth there to have an income . 
  so of course when mafias offer them a way to make 100-500 $ / day after a few years of high poverty and 10 years of unemployment , they take it . 
  and that 's why the locals tends to cover mafias , it 's the living of entire neighborhoods . 
  so if you think just keeping a % age of your population in prison constantly like the us and not giving anyone any ressources is going to fix the problem , you 're going to have a bad time . 
  that map is probably not exhaustive , or does n't include well known hidden money or is only counting raw cash : - dassault is likely richer in france since he 's the one getting the money from dassault weapon & aeronautics industries . 
  but lots of is probably not cash and/or ca n't be really moved around lest we catch him and the fisc ( irs ) ask for what he actually owes as taxes . 
  and that industry is heavily regulated . 
  - kolomo\u00efsky is definitely richer in ukraine ( the dnipro region might as well be called kolomoiskypetrovsk and the guy collect passports like some collect travels abroad ) - usmanov 's definitely not the richest man in russia haha - ingvar kamprad is probably weighting 40b in sweden ( but of course he 's busy pretending he 's not rich and that it 's a taxfree offshore company that owns ikea and not him ; riiiiiight / s ), 
   well even small time drug dealing , pick-pocketing , petty theft etc petty theft and drug dealing are a symptom of poverty . 
  you do n't make hunger disappear by beating people when they starve and try to steal bread or sell drug to buy it . 
  the only thing they 'll try harder is not getting caught . 
  that 's a problem that can only be seriously addressed with policies addressing poverty .

  it is named a `` block '' . 
  each block begins by the hash of another block . 
  boom . 
  all this is n't new nor complicated . 
  what 's new , though , is getting it to work in a hostile environment where the pot for breaking it ( long term control of the tip of the chain ) is 40b usd . 
  this is why blockchains alone - without the consensus protocol being executed directly on the hostile environment - will never be more than enterprisehype \u2122 slow databases . 
  i personally think satoshi is an nsa committee . 
  lots of things have come from the us military . 
  tor , for example . 
  you have absolutely no idea what you are talking about . 
  making your voice heard in the upcoming election could help in this regard . 
  i know most people find voting for afd to be supremely disgusting . 
  and i understand that . 
  but it sends a signal . 
  they wo n't ever come remotely close to any kind of power ; but others will definitely get the message . 
  -- in france , macron got elected by a huge margin ; and what did he say in his victory address ? 
  `` i want to remove reasons for people to vote fn '', 
  can you tell that to merkel , please ? 
  in the elections , i mean . 
  this is geopolitical . 
  as much money as we pour into nato should be poured into this project . 
  do n't listen to him . 
  he 's a lunatic troll , and he is a [ pedophile ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/daniel_cohn-bendit#on_paedophilia ) . 
  given how well turkey and russia cooperate in syria and so many other subjects , that 's becoming less and less obvious by the minute . 
  true : / this kind of crap is why many despise the eu . 
  tried and true classics blended together . 
  i like you style . 
  it does n't work like that . 
  you do n't send them where you want . 
  this is : `` go wherever you feel like '' . 
  calais is in for another fun season . 
  look , french diplomacy at work . 
  prepare for some serious butthurt coming from the sultan . 
   was brutally murdered by a muslim intruder i regret so much these poor people are the ones having to do the southern trip . 
  * economic migrants and that should be obvious to everyone . 
  these migrants wo n't enter the job market by the high paying end . 
  how about changing the words to : `` learning to plan together '', 
  and each day russia behaves badly , it encourages our turkish neighbor to be free to behave badly . 
  it 's high time to remove turkey from nato . 
  these two are playing the alliance . 
  do n't you encourage them to immigrate . 
  with the new generation of turks having this in their head , we have to bar them accession permanently . 
  they made their choice . 
  i 'd rather have the lesson be taught without the flooding . 
  also , since there is freedom of movement it affects us all . 
  each country should have a veto over any entry/asylum/naturalization case another country reviews . 
  i sort of disagree . 
  they allowed this situation to happen . 
  without eu maintaining the borders , it was their responsibility . 
  it 's their responsibility now to fix it . 
  does italy have a deportation program ? 
  i mean , other than this visa initiative . 
  you 're not even trying to address any point . 
  just like the commission , you 're handwaving it all . 
  no concern shall ever be so important as to garner that you daign brush lightly over the issue . 
  at some point people will violently correct the democratic deficit in the eu . 
  dear god , addressing arguments in a calm way is that difficult ? 
  when the eu will properly handles a difficult crisis , and actually responds to popular demand to tackle said crisis , i 'll believe in it . 
  the eu is a joke at the moment . 
  -- op 's document is low-grade propaganda . 
  take part 11 , and look at what is in the middle of the page :  over 400 000 people rescued at see this is not what we 're asking for . 
  we 're asking you not to create them in the first place . 
  you let the inflow grow . 
  just today we learnt that the inflatable was provided by eu countries in the first place !, 
  and a large part of them actually dies in this inflated inflow . 
  how many did the eu indirectly murder by its inaction ? 
  they would be alive right now . 
  in a poor country sure , but alive . 
  and then where do these 400 000 people go ? 
  are they going to have a `` to be deported '' status until you tire us with more lies ? 
  are you planning to use our focused vote on this issue so that you can get away with more crap you feed us while we 're distracted ? 
  -- further down :  the eu is fighting traffickers [ ... ] people smugglers earned over eur 4 billion in 2015 alone from migrants they brought to greece and italy oh , so you mean the smugglers operate down to the actual landing in italy ? 
  i do n't get it , does this mean ngos are considered smugglers too ? 
  has this been the commission 's opinion all along ? 
  why the fuck did n't you do anything about that ? 
  when are you putting ngo 's personnel in prison , where they belong ? 
  -- it 's been 4 years this is going on . 
  and the eu want us to praise them for such weak , late and incomplete response ? 
  the eu needs serious reform , and the commission need to be scrapped entirely . 
  and we were supplying the boats the whole time ? 
  heads need to roll . 
   there is one country in europe that will benefit most from a european turkey , this is greece . 
  your fm is saying this , do you support him and his government ? 
  what would be the opinion of the man on the street about that ? 
   there are 220,000 people living in the occupied part , of which only 100,000 are turkish cypriots . 
  the other 100,000 are settlers and a part of them is abroad , mainly in london . 
  someone please let me understand how does that work and why london comes into play . 
  is this why the uk was pushing for having turkey in the eu ? 
  does this mean that if we resolve the cyprus crisis , we can finally close the eu door to turkey forever ? 
  how about everybody stops doing crappy things ? 
  this selective censorhip is regular behavior . 
  you sandwich one post against immigration between two that are for , and the three will be put in the mod queue . 
  only the two for will get approved , and the middle one will linger in the queue . 
  basically you need to fit one mod 's * political opinion * to have things approved . 
  hear , hear . 
  you can be a humanitarian superpower abroad . 
  unfortunately . 
  having border control and naturalization processes at the local level , when the freedom of movement is at the global level is a crappy position to be in . 
  do n't you dare remove this comment . 
  i 've screenshotted it .

  it is inevitable . 
  you are falling in the trap of historical determinism . 
  history has no direction and is n't a curb going somewhere , for all we know increased tensions and perhaps wars could torn geopolital entities apart , reduce the level of cooperation/communication between each , or who know what . 
  `` never '' is too strong a word . 
  internationalism/mondial governance is possible , but thinking you can achieve it just by weakening nationalism is stupid and dangerous . 
  there is many prerequites for it to happen and some vague feeling of belonging among the intelligentsia and talks loaded of historical determinism are simply not enough . 
  france should do more ? 
  i mean , i 'm all for an increase in the defense budget , but considering france 's military involvement ( currently and in the past years ) against islamists groups in africa and middle-east i 'd argue that france is currently the one doing the most . 
  which migration are you talking about exactly ? 
  because before the end of the third century it does n't seems to me one could say the locals were `` subjugated '' by external migrations . 
  rome had many troubles ( normal for a big empire ) but its major problem ( and ultimately what caused its weakness and disavantageous deals with external people ) was political instability . 
  if you want to point out physical insecurity , you should rather speak of civil wars . 
  well augustus did a good job , i think . 
  and louis the pious did what he could , but with high autonomy provinces , high agitation and problems with his heirs ... 
  yep , but i did n't thought it would be almost ignored . 
  the number of deads should n't have such an impact on the relevancy of news . 
  i heard at the radio ( it was just after the attack and i did n't get comfirmation ) that it was czech soldiers that reacted quickly and very well . 
  whoever they were , congrats to the ones who guarded the headquarters . 
  a bit surprised that this did n't receive more attention on / r/europe and reddit as a whole . 
  not enough innocents victims i guess . 
  well it 's a common military mission , not a mission for a common military , 
  it 's strange , really , to fail to understand that there may be cases where such interventions can profit both countries ? 
  regional instability , control by aqmi , mujao and others of north mali and perhaps the whole of mali is in the interest of neither malians nor french , so is this so hard to see that the intervention was beneficial to both ? 
  i do n't see your point , considering that in this occurence , this government was democratically elected . 
  i think this attack against the belgian police is largely undeserved , and quite obnoxious considering the context . 
  well , when i 'm saying `` trust '' , i 'm thinking about putin thinking `` what is this promise of france and germany to not let ukraine enter nato and eu worth ? '' . 
  if it 's judged too frail , then the option of invading/creating a conflict in eastern-ukraine to keep ukraine from joining nato can become much more appaling , the only mean to be certain of it in fact . 
  in lybia france managed to obtain from an extremely reticent russia its absention/non-veto for a un mandate , with the stated objective to create a no-fly zone to protect cyr\u00e9naique from kadhafi 's repression . 
  then the mandate was kind of stretched to cover a much heavier support of the rebellion and to remove kadhaffi , to the furor of the russian who felt betrayed by the false garantee of `` it 's just a no-fly zone '' , and heavily impacted the trust-level of russia in foreign affairs . 
  there is also the diplomatical profit/loss of each position , and with a seat on the unsc and a direct implication in syria , russia 's good will is objectively more `` useful '' to france than that of poland . 
  on the other hand european relationships are a delicate and long term thing , and poland is n't the only ee country concerned about russia . 
  though i 'd argue that western europe 's good relations with russia is n't necessarily a bad thing for ee . 
  i feel that if russia felt that it could trust its western europeans partners , maybe military intervention could have been avoided , in everyone 's best interests ( and perhaps a solution could have been found for syria ) . 
  but 2011 and libya 's intervention ruined a good chunk of our diplomatical capital with them . 
  yes i 'm aware of the caracal possible contract . 
  but like every military contract i 'd wait before it is done , as these things are quite fickle . 
  well the good explanation for the preponderance would be `` same name as st martin , very popular saint back then '' . 
  if i 'm not mistaken , orthodox priests are n't allowad to marry ( and have child ) , but married men/fathers are authorised to be ordained ( `` made priest '' , not sure of the translation for `` ordonn\u00e9s '' ) . 
  and bishops are necessarily celibate . 
  well old french is mostly the same ( just written funnily with `` y '' and `` f '' here and there . 
  obviously the more recent it is the more ressembling it is , but even medieval french is understandable , even if difficult ) and much older than napoleonic era . 
  its diffusion beyond the elites and some regions is indeed relatively more recent , really started with fran\u00e7ois ier and by napoleon the vast majority spoke it even if they spoke another local language ( still a few millions that did n't spoke it . 
  i 'll check the numbers if you 're interested ) . 
  11 billions for france ( 12 in 2012 ) , i would n't call that little . 
  and in the context of geopolitics , it 's important to see `` what do i gain '' vs `` what do i sacrifice '' . 
  russia is perceived as a threat by poland , so of course they are more willing to enforce sanctions , but france have no reason of its own to do so , and is only going in that direction because of european and atlantist alliances . 
  and i suppose some moral considerations and internal politics/public opinion as well . 
  the ukrainians fought mainly against corruption , then against excessive repression . 
  not because they all fell enamored with `` european values '' , even if the the government 's move on the european accord was the start of the contestation that became maidan . 
  and i 'd argue that in regard of corruption , they still have big problems in which they have an heavy responsibility . 
  on the other hand i 'm not sure this unholy blob has anything ressembling a back :p, 
  ottomans would probably accept , as war is going badly for him and he ca n't focus on two front . 
  so white peace would ride him of this troublesome ethiopia who attacked him in his moment of weakness . 
  for the alliance jumping rule : i ( hejaz ) have currently 1/2 alliance ( with hormuz ) . 
  ethiopia is fighting ottomans , and i wish to join the fight . 
  can i ally ethiopia to do so , as it does n't require me to cancel one of my alliance ( and that i am planning to ally ethiopia anyway ) ? 
  the alternative would be basically suicide , as even a crippled ottoman would crush hejaz in a separate war when the other conflicts are over . 
  you mispelled jean-yves le drian, 
   but you are assuming that the person to inherit the position is the best suited , which is honestly plain ignorant . 
  at no moment did i say he was the best suited . 
  i just pointed out a problem/inherent flaw with the democratic selection process . 
  seriously , is it possible to have a discution about the pros and cons of different political systems without being branded as a dangerous/stupid anti-democrat ? 
  nowadays we just dogmatically accept `` democracy is inherently good . '', 
  ( with , implied , `` our political system is democratic '' ) , without giving much thought to why is it good ( or if it is necessarily always the best system in every context ) , or what is democracy . 
  and as soon as you try discuting it and/or implying that perhaps democracy is n't pragmatically superior in every points and in every situation , or try debating the ideological fondations of democracy , you 're a primitive thinker/a fascist/an enemy of the people . 
  the problem is that a * lot * of people think that they are better suited , if not the best suited for this kind of job . 
  and that the ones emerging in the merciless competitions to determine which will get there are not necessary the better suited ( they are the best to get elected , but that does n't necessarily makes you the best head of state ) , and are tied by pacts and compromises with a good chunk of the political scene . 
  belgium and spain make it looks like it 's really useful to have a constitutionnal monarchy when facing a government crisis and/or strong sescessionists movements . 
   this is n't even isolated to poland as its basically what every part of the european right wants . 
  putting allies in every place is a temptation for every political powers , it 's not exclusive to the `` european right '' . 
  do n't you already have an island full of mafiosi ? 
  well there is at least programs to * detect * the arrival of big meteors . 
  also the probability of a catastrophic collision happening in the next decades is relatively low , and by then we 'll have better technological means to deal with it . 
  they 're going to peace out right at the start of the session ? 
  would turn ugly for the southern powers , unless ottomans are crawling in debts . 
  well you can always take some nearly irrelevant nation with either no players or a friendly player around . 
  personnally i picked hejaz and although i 'm doing badly my poor performance do n't risk to have a bad impact . 
   that we can discuss in a pm yeah , would n't want / u/kembell to know about your nefarious plan to attack tyrol :p, 
  well , perhaps the balance of power is more needed in europe than africa . 
  it 's true that if france-castille-savoy turn against italy ( franc is probably going to eat some more of england first though ) and crush them then we could see a pretty immobile balance of power with castille-france-ottomans as the big europeans players ( and maybe savoy . 
  and i do n't know about eastern europe ) . 
  on the other hand , african played countries would be nice , and could help against tunis and perhaps ottomans . 
  i do n't know , really . 
  can hejaz join ? 
  arabia , italy , both peninsulas , it 's the same !, 
  what do you mean `` filthy kebabs '' ? 
  i swear , we are the worst muslims ever !, 
  on the other hand , they * ca n't afford * not to attack the ottomans in their moment of weakness . 
  they are on venice 's border and with the taking of georgia and vassalisation of persia were really blobbing out of control . 
  it 's now or never , same reason why ethiopia ( and soon hejaz ) are attacking it by the south , even if it is dangerous , in particular in a separate war . 
  but yeah , savoy and france are a big threat , and the italians are in an uneasy position in the middle/long-term . 
  i would n't dare . 
  papacy-venise best western alliance . 
  hejaz is n't included either , but i do n't have any delusions of grandeur : beside fighting a sterile war against oman , going bankrupt and stagnating technologically i did n't do much before the end of the session :(, 
  is n't it slightly italian ? 
  a glorious tradition !, 
  also , italy being relevant . 
  it 's very nice !, 
  if you allow me , perhaps it would be better for the narration to use some past/use the present in a more dynamic way . 
  with everything in present and a stating tone i took some time to understand it was a chronogical narration and not an analysis of a final map .

  watching movies and tv series in english is like learning without having to do anything . 
  watch stuff in english with subtitles in your language , then switch to english subtitles , and after a while you wo n't need them at all . 
  sorry , he/she was talking about latin americans so i assumed it was an american . 
  it 's even weirder then . 
  i do n't know , it might be because you sound all over the place . 
  i 'm not even sure that you 're not trolling . 
  in case you 're not , you ca n't straight up go to people and tell them you want 10 millions of muslims or latin americans to come and expect everyone to agree with you . 
  also we do n't have to introduce social democracy to anyone , let them develop and see what is best for themselves . 
  i 'm guessing you 're american ? 
  maybe focus on introducing progressive views to your own countrymen/women without sounding so categorical about things . 
  my advice is to maybe try to be more moderate in how you express your views . 
  how is cyber attack gon na help fight climate change anyway lol . 
  how low have we fallen ?!, 
  what , i did n't even know it was a thing , you guys are lucky, 
  i tried to look it up and could n't find anything about bilingual songs . 
  i 'm guessing it would count in the 40 % because the law is not that strict . 
  some french singers sing in english and they are n't counted in the french 40 % needed . 
  i have no idea about the instrumental songs but it 's not like there 's a lot of those on the radio . 
  no not pure ( it does n't mean anything ) , but alive and well . 
  also to keep the french music industry from disappearing i suppose . 
  to protect the francophonie and french artists ? 
  the law also says half of the songs in french have to be from new artists or new productions . 
  by law , 40 % of the songs on the radio have to be in french . 
  yeah i remember when they only had yellow ones that you could n't buy and i also remember when blue ones showed up for sale and how happy it made me lol . 
  it 's probably in their top 5 bestseller items now . 
  you 're right , let 's wait and see if it 's enforced . 
  roaming charges will be gone by june 2017 ( it was announced not long ago ) , 
  that 's funny how a lot of us use ikea bags for this . 
  bet they never expected that . 
  the eu is a scapegoat , especially during election time . 
  the thing is , most people do n't know what good and beneficial laws they pass there ( there 's very little `` pr '' about it ) so it 's easy to blame them for every little thing that goes wrong . 
  of course it 's not perfect but it 's not the big evil that some candidates make it out to be . 
  i think what matters is how you grew up , if you grew up far away from everything and had to drive all the time an hour or more to go to a big city then you are used to having to travel more , if you grew up near a big city maybe you are less used to traveling long distances . 
  not often . 
  there 's a french air force base about 50 km away from me so sometimes i hear military planes . 
  they make a huge sound so you ca n't mistake them for anything else , and i always wonder `` are they going somewhere or are they training '' . 
  it 's always weird ( and kind of cool too ) to hear them but it does n't happen a lot , maybe once every 4 months or so . 
  american scripted shows are great and hugely popular in france . 
  a lot of them are shown on tv ( dubbed but on some channels you can chose to watch them in english with subs ) but a lot of people ( let 's say under 40 yo ) download or stream them . 
  from what i 've seen , your news seem too `` click baity '' and feel like entertainment , very fluffy . 
  as for influence , i 'd say it has very little influence on french tv . 
  sometimes some people want to try to make a `` late night show '' but in french and so far it has n't worked . 
  they also tried to adapt snl in french , only one episode aired a month ago , i dont know how it went , but that 's about it for the influence . 
  you did all the work haha . 
  enjoy . 
  yep that 's it !, 
  france 24 aired it with english dubs but i do n't think they posted the full video ( i do n't know if they have the rights ? ), 
  you can still see some clips on their site http://www.france24.com/en/video, 
  +1 for stromae . 
  i ca n't really think of anything else i like , french pop is not very good . 
  it 's the same for every language in the world , you have to learn the basics ( with a teacher or books ) , then the vocabulary , then you have to surround ( i almost typed surrender - ha ) yourself with books podcasts movies etc in that language . 
  the problem with dialects and smaller languages is the difficulty in finding stuff in that language but i do n't think it matters what resources you use . 
  also since it 's our first language it 's hard to know what can be used by foreigners to learn it since we 've never had to do it . 
  it might be better to ask people that are also studying that language what they are using . 
  if you ask french people on the street who they think was the best king a vast majority will say louis xiv , he is our most popular king no doubt . 
  clovis , charlemagne , louis xiv , napol\u00e9on and de gaulle are considered the greatest ones ( we 've had a lot of other good ones ) , with louis xiv being probably the most loved overall . 
  p\u00e9tain is the worst we 've had . 
  we call greece the cradle of europe ( in france anyway ) , with the democracy , the philosophers and the myths so i 'd like to go one day to visit . 
  i 'd also love to visit norway , sweden and russia . 
  but every country/culture in europe seems interesting to me even if some appeal to me more than others . 
  unfortunately i already mentioned where i live in other threads so i 'd rather not make it too easy to find me sorry :(, 
  we both have both kinds . 
  pomme frites are the big ones and frites the regular thin ones . 
  `` the sparkling water war '' has a nice ring to it tho, 
  too soon man, 
  it does n't , you 're not english . 
  but you do n't call it that anymore right ? 
  french braid is also correct ( tresse fran\u00e7aise ), 
  french fries - from belgium, 
  the france/england rivalry , we do n't call any other country `` the perfidious '' . 
  i 'm convinced they named the water between england and france `` the english channel '' just to piss us off . 
  it worked  . 
  why are you approaching them ? 
  does it look like they are lost or need help ? 
  i would just say `` sorry do you need help ? '' or something like that . 
  if you just want to speak for no particular reason maybe something like `` oh hello are you from europe ? 
  `` with a smile and ask them where they 're from and start there . 
  i do n't really know haha . 
  you would get still water , you have to specify if you want ( disgusting ) sparkling water . 
  according to wikipedia my city is 2500 years old . 
  my house is 367 years old . 
  for the vowels with accents we do have names , \u00ef is called `` i tr\u00e9ma '' for example . 
  i see , no name for it , just how it sounds . 
  thanks for the explanation , 
  alright , the media probably made a bigger deal of it than it was then . 
  there 's still the problem of who is checking the machines tho , is it a private company ? 
  i just think it 's not worth the trouble . 
  does it matter ? 
  the end result is the same . 
  the point is still that your vote is being counted for a party you did n't want to vote for and that 's not acceptable . 
  you 're right , i should have said it . 
  that 's why i said '' it is said '' because i do n't think there 's any real numbers or anything since it 's not allowed . 
  haha i just keep messing up :( how do you call the letter \u00e4 then ? 
  it is said that most muslims or culturally muslim people vote the left here . 
  and for `` blacks '' `` latino '' etc , it 's actually against the law to keep records of people 's ethnicity , i 'll let you figure out why . 
  in france you should n't have any problem when it comes to being black ( unless you are unlucky and comes face to face with a huge racist asshole , but even racist people usually do n't voice it out loud ) but you do n't have to avoid any places so do n't stress about it . 
  being american is another thing . 
  just do n't take it personally , most things will be said in good fun ( unless you are a fervent trump supporter ) or just for the sake of argument ( french people love talking about politics ) . 
  depending on where you go in europe , not speaking the language can be a problem yes . 
  where are you from if you do n't mind me asking ?

  france will invite dutch scientists to sort out some dykes . 
  it looks like the uk will seek an exception , and the eu should grant it . 
  my apologies for the snark . 
  several people thought i was deprecating the amount involved , whereas i was n't making any comment but merely trying to put it in perspective . 
  yeah i 'm more gaelic than gallic , but whatevs . 
  whatever you say , good sir dummy . 
  yeah i have n't read the article yet but it was linked to on one of the uk subs : https://www.byline.com/column/67/article/1777, 
  is that rees mogg 's plan ? 
  you said it buddy . 
   it 's not an upcoming crisis or anything but it 's an unfortunate trend . 
  also a concern for basic stuff like housing . 
  the more atomized our family structures become , the greater our need for separate units of accommodation . 
  agreed , and that 's why i am concerned about the number . 
  however , life is n't always simple and forcing people to stay together could also lead to negative outcomes for the children . 
  i 'd be more concerned about [ this stat ] ( https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/livebirths/bulletins/birthsummarytablesenglandandwales/2016 ) :  the percentage of babies born outside of marriage or civil partnership in 2016 was 48 % ; of these , two-thirds had parents who lived together . 
  suggesting that 1 child in 6 will be raised in a single-parent household . 
  i 've nothing against single parents , but it 's difficult to raise a child by oneself . 
  very nice collage . 
  just do n't withdraw from euratom . 
  bloody ideology trumping good sense . 
  lol , white knighting much ? 
  avast sir , ye have wounded me to the very quick !, 
  go fuck yourself . 
  i responded that way to / u/historybuffamerican because it was the third time someone had said the same thing , viz that it was a substantial amount of money . 
  but nice white knighting all the same . 
  good job . 
   yet somehow we are suddenly this no mark little isolationist island because we decided the eu is n't for us . 
  did you read the article ? 
  it 's speculative , obviously , but it makes some important points about your political leaders . 
  may is caught between a rock and a hard place at the moment . 
  even worse , they might have katie hopkins on board !, 
   there is a finite amount of bitcoin in circulation and a finite amount to be mined . 
  this is a huge distinction between bitcoin and a ponzi scheme that 's an interesting distinction , but bitcoin is designed to be sub-divisible to the \u03bcbtc level , representing a millionth of a bitcoin . 
  if you say so . 
  if you say so . 
  a ponzi scheme uses money from new investors to pay earlier investors . 
   investing in bitcoin is pretty blatant that you are hoping someone in the future will pay you more than you are currently buying at . 
  that 's not a ponzi scheme , that 's just simple investing . 
  no it 's not . 
  it 's speculative investment . 
  simple investing involves buying a stock or a bond with some expected return . 
  for example , i invest in a company because i expect it to be profitable in the future and pay dividends . 
  i have a belief that the company will produce something that can be sold profitably . 
  speculation involves buying something with the expectation that that thing can be sold at a higher price . 
  i do n't have any opinion on the thing , except that the price will rise . 
   anyone who works with blockchain will always have respect ( or trust ) in it . 
  three years, 
   while doing minimal research as usual . 
  i 've been reading about bitcoin for years . 
  you 've missed the key word in my post - ` intrinsic ' . 
  there 's nothing except adoption that distinguishes bitcoin from a host of other crypto-currencies . 
   everyone buying bitcoin realizes that it 's price depends on someone down the line wanting to pay more for it than you did you 're basically saying that the price of bitcoin should always rise ? 
  ( wanting to pay more for it ) that 's not a normal behaviour for a currency . 
   investing in a decentralized and distributed ledger which is an idea largely gaining traction in the finance sector . 
  there are plenty of reasons why distributed ledgers are interesting but bitcoin is n't a key component . 
  why would you invest in a distributed ledger ? 
   so yeah calling bitcoin a ponzi scheme when it is blatantly obvious why it 's price fluctuates is the equivalent of blowing air out of your ass and the fact that it has that many upvotes says a lot about this sub . 
  sorry to rain on your tirade , but you have n't explained why people buy bitcoin other than to say that its price must always rise . 
  if you say so . 
  blockchain is very interesting , but it does n't depend on bitcoin . 
   blockchain is not an application . 
  blockchain is a programming concept . 
  er no , it 's both . 
  blockchain is used to describe distributed ledger applications . 
  it 's moved beyond the concept stage and has an existence separately from bitcoin . 
   bitcoin is an application of the blockchain concept . 
  no , bitcoin includes an application of the blockchain concept , along with a host of concepts around exchange . 
   to attack the chain nobody said anything about attacking the chain ? 
   so yes , possible , and it 's also possible that peoples decide overnight that they actually do n't like gold that much . 
  or that they develop more confidence in another distributed system of transaction . 
   that 's ... well still globally wrong . 
  normally i wait between posts to contradict myself . 
  but you 've jumped right in with your next sentence ...  a blockchain is just a programming concept , but yes , a very interesting one , with indeed many more and more important application than just bitcoin . 
  the bitcoin infrastructure is interesting of course , but it 's not necessarily tied to bitcoin and there 's no reason it could n't be used to maintain some other public ledger . 
  bitcoin 's greatest strength is its history , but i do n't think that 's a sufficient condition for it to continue unchallenged . 
  okay you mean the `` r/europe '' attitude . 
  i thought you meant public opinion . 
  carry on so . 
  no it has n't . 
  blockchain is a very interesting application , and it 's much more important than bitcoin . 
   lol those prices . 
  modern f16 's alone cost far more than $ 16m i wrote 19m , rather than 16m . 
  from here : http://www.af.mil/about-us/fact-sheets/display/article/104505/f-16-fighting-falcon/ unit cost : f-16a / b , $ 14.6 million ( fiscal 98 constant dollars ) ; f-16c / d , $ 18.8 million ( fiscal 98 constant dollars ) 19m in 1998 dollars would be about 28m in 2016 . 
  so mea culpa . 
  lol, 
   there is an idiot higher that rehash the same tired old circlejerk about `` ponzi scheme '' stating that bitcoin has no intrinsic value . 
  lol . 
  fuck you and your passive aggressive commenting . 
  you misread my comment anyway . 
   material removed from service . 
  you could have clarified that before i went window shopping . 
  think about my search history ... 
  with all these scientists , france is gon na have the best climate !, 
  yeah fair enough . 
  he started on the right and drifted further to the right over time . 
  there 's nothing intrinsic to bitcoin to distinguish it from a ponzi scheme . 
  the one good brother in the kaczynski clan . 
  in that case i agree :-), 
   it 's more than you think . 
  you have no idea what i think .

  the only piece of evidence is an electronic document from 4-chan . 
  i do n't see what could be a weakest piece of evidence ( except maybe a marian apparition ) . 
  you should realize in does n't make sense . 
  because for each person in a relationship with someone much older , there 's someone in a relationship with someone much younger . 
  i prefer to be naive than unfair and prejudiced . 
  just give us a proof , then . 
  i wo n't think someone is guilty of a crime just because of his job . 
  i think it 's indeed fake news . 
  nothing but a doctored picture supports it . 
  that the english version . 
  the american one will be `` we elected a tremedous president !, 
  best president in the world !, 
  you voted for failing president !, 
  sad !, 
  pathetic ! '' . 
  of course , i 'll wait the the results before bragging , i do n't want to jinx the election . 
  i will vote for macron , if only because it will allow me to get uppity with my british and american fellows . 
  i think a lot of people of the far-left were planning not to vote . 
  then they saw le pen in the debate and thought `` okay mate , i may hate macron 's liberal project , but there 's still a different between macron and * that * '' . 
  first reason : they had a bad relationship while they were in the same government . 
  second reason : valls is hated by a lot of people ( when he was prime minister , he forced some laws through the assembly and there 's a political price for that ) . 
  they may work together , if macron thinks what valls brings is worth the price ( he still a former prime minister and a leader on the left ) , but when valls said he was going to vote macron , macron did n't put it on his website ( unlike obama 's video ) . 
  le pen is not unpredictable : we know we 're fucked if she 's elected . 
  and she 's a very well tested opportunist , she even managed to steal money from the european parliament while being in favour of the end of europe . 
  people will be frustrated by macron ( if he wins ) next sunday at 8h01 pm . 
  that 's the way french politics work . 
  for everything else , it will depends a lot on the legislative elections in june and how the two `` classical '' parties ( ps and lr , who have been alternatively in power since decades ) will fare . 
  with all the political alliances , backstabing it involves . 
  i 'm sure he prefers obama 's support rather than valls ' or parisot 's supports . 
   if trump can get elected , so can someone who actually knows what she 's doing . 
  after the debate last night , i would n't put ms le pen in this category . 
  well ... 
  i doubt farage is seen as a leader outside england . 
  there 's a * away * missing in your sentence . 
   another foreign leader influencing the french election . 
  the problem has never been that foreign leaders or former leaders say they support one candidate . 
  as long as it 's done openly , as an information ( and a sign of international credibility ) for voters . 
  for example i 've no problem with putin endorsing the candidates trump or le pen . 
  i 've problem with everything else , done covertly . 
  like ms le pen , terrorists do indeed belong to the fear and hate mongers . 
  oh , wait , who 's the honorary president of the fn , marine 's party ? 
  that 's right , her father . 
  arlette laguiller disagrees . 
   ( for those wont do n't know her : she was on the left of the communist party and was candidate in every presidential election from 1974 to 2007 ), 
  that 's what we had in 2002 , with jean-marie le pen as the candidate of the fn and bruno m\u00e9gret as a dissident candidate . 
  le pen still went to the second round . 
  yes , she 's more taking back rather than gaining voters from m\u00e9lenchon . 
  and anyway , the uk has laws against importing rabid animals . 
  they may have the flag or the ip , the problem is they ca n't speak french . 
  so we have memes that do n't make sense at all on a grammatical level . 
  and when google translate is efficient , they do n't make sense on a political level ( as in `` even a die-hard fn activist would n't say that '' ) . 
  it 's annoying , nothing more . 
  i bow before your superior logic , take my upvote and my admiration !, 
  louis xiv disagrees . 
  what does one call `` uprising '' ? 
  because depending on the definition ( and the definition of the words used in the different countries ) , the study can mean very different things . 
  i do n't have a solution and i do n't blame anyone . 
  i 'm just stating a fact in a disillusioned way . 
   a shitty , 600 $ / month under-the-table gig and a lot of under-the-table jobs will hurt the society and the economy ( not a personal criticism , just an illustration of a vicious circle ) . 
  you 're trying to have a child ( through adoption ) or you 're trying to do humanitarian work ? 
  they are two different activities and confusing them will only hurt the kid . 
   is it really better to be a black person in europe than america ? 
  it depends on the place , it depends on the name , it depends on how the child is raised ( i do n't mean well/badly , i mean the cultural codes ) . 
  i mean , in the america , there 's will be a difference wether the child is the child of a lawyer in california or the child of an unemployed single mom in alabama . 
  and if macron wins , we 'll be buying cakes with euros . 
  the extrem-right manifestations also happen every year ( something to do with jeanne d'arc allegedly . 
  they should make a mash-up with theresa may , she also wants england out of continental europe ) . 
  this year , it 's up to eleven ( or thirteen ) because of the elections , but the dynamic is not new . 
   precisely because the police is seen as complicit in her being so high . 
  come one , black blocks and other extremists have always been rabidly anti-police , it has nothing to do with the results of the first round . 
   the level of what the french consider acceptable in terms of attacks by rioters is ... ... not homogeneous among the society , to say the least . 
  it 's not very distant . 
  tell that to the wookies or the ewoks . 
   yes , but that 's where they fucked up , if they are going that shes the daughter of vader the poster says `` i 'm my father '' . 
  so it 's clear she 's vader/jean-marie le pen . 
  so politically distant that he 's still the honorary president of the front national . 
  spoken like a true island !, 
   it is a display of frustration on germany 's influence in the eu more like `` it 's a display of frustration on germany 's success '' . 
   for me to see germany endorse any french leader even le pen is quite disturbing for me foreign leaders have done that forever . 
  the only advice i have if you want to sail in the mediterranean sea : bring a sheep in case you encounter a russian spy ship . 
  it can happen , if the abstention is high enough . 
  some on the far left prefer to have le pen president than voting for an ex-banker . 
  it 's not really true and it stands out on this graph : neither our dem nor our rep are on it ( if dem and rep are the two historical parties that have been in power for half a century in france ) . 
  with the electoral college , the campain would have been different , the political life would have been different . 
  it 's a bit like asking `` what would have been the score of this football match if we had used the american football rules ? '', 
  assuming americans and europeans have an equal probability of defecating in a shop , then you 're right , because walmart shops are more common in the usa than in europe . 
  it 's really hard to say who would have won . 
  because the campain strategies would have been different . 
  because the political life itself would be different . 
  the problem is less her program ( it 's just promises ) than her party . 
   well , technically , the us has more to gain at this point . 
  if the us had planned a secret operation to make assad look guilty and that it worked , you can be sure trump would have boasted about it on twitter . 
  apparently , yes , they 're this bad . 
  her father chose `` front national '' , which is also the name of a bunch of far-right leagues in the 30 's ( yes , it 's exactly what you think ) . 
  and in this case , it may not be a coincidence . 
  so she has no reason to be jealous . 
  in french : https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/front_national_%28ann%c3%a9es_1930%29, 
  indeed , with macron the problem is he may not be able to follow his program . 
  on the other side , the problem with le pen is that she may be able to follow hers . 
  fillon was attacked because he was given ten of thousands euros worth of costum for `` no reason '' , not because he owned them .

  * a pretty old one and dead now , but back in 2006 it was really big : `` les no\u00eblistes '' ( noelism ) . 
  basically the jeuxvideo.com forums had [ this ] ( https://wiki.jvflux.com/images/f/fe/noel.gif ) emote , called `` noel '' . 
  and people started posting it after every message , then they called themselves `` noelists '' , began joking about it as if it were a cult , and started doing website defacement and stuff . 
  they also managed to rile up a two-bit rapper called morsay ( more on this guy later ) who posted videos with his pseudo-ghetto friends about how he would fuck noelists ' mothers . 
  they also got coverage here and there in the press as a `` far right '' group . 
  * morsay / truands de la gal\u00e8re : a useless rapper from clignancourt , their only real song is called `` on s ` en bat les couilles '' ( `` we do n't give a shit '' ) where they just hang around with fake guns and repeat this over and over . 
  he 's mostly known for videos where he and his friends keep insulting the camera for no real reason , stuff like `` i fuck you , your wife , your mother , your father , your grandmother , your dog , i take 10 $ and i call a gay , we attach you in the truck and he fucks you in the ass , now click on my videos sluts '' . 
  * moundir : a participant of koh lanta ( local version of * survivor * , known because he kept getting into fights with people , his sexist remarks , his creative expressions , etc. 
  on his second stint on the show , when he was eliminated he screamed `` no honour !, 
  why so corrupt ! '', 
  so you see that sometimes . 
  * former right-wing minister nadine morano ( of `` i 'm not racist , i have a tchadian friend who 's even more black than arabs '' fame ) and christian party leader christine boutin are living memes as well . 
  apart from a few far-left loonies and one or two twisted extreme far right-wingers , europeans do n't support hamas , but a lot of europeans do support a free palestine . 
  note also that it 's not uniform across europe - france has traditionally been close to the arab countries , whereas germany and the uk are huge supports to israel . 
  funnily enough , only one kiss means real closeness . 
  fuck , forgot about that one !, 
  some relatively recent films : [ blue is the warmest colour . 
  ] ( http://fr.web.img5.acsta.net/pictures/210/359/21035935_20130903173858999.jpg ) a really beautiful film , do n't let its reputation fool you . 
  `` came for the porn , stayed for the amazing movie '' is a very common opinion !, 
  ] ( http://fr.web.img6.acsta.net/medias/nmedia/18/82/69/17/19806656.jpg ) very rich guy who suffers from paralysis gets a full-time helper from the ghettos . 
  it 's really pretty funny , and based on a true story too . 
  a good prison flick . 
  it 's a fairly classic and traditional rise-and-fall story , but it 's pretty well made . 
  ] ( http://fr.web.img6.acsta.net/medias/nmedia/18/36/10/96/19649758.jpg ) it 's probably the film i find the funniest ever . 
  a lot of jokes are probably lost in translation , though ... there 's an american remake called a dinner for schmucks but watching the trailer , it looks like it sucks balls . 
  a wwi film about a woman whose fianc\u00e9 is reported dead but she does n't believe it and goes looking out for him . 
  [ oss 117 : le caire nid d'espions ] ( http://fr.web.img5.acsta.net/medias/nmedia/18/35/95/94/18602611.jpg ) and [ oss 117 : rio ne r\u00e9pond plus ] ( http://fr.web.img4.acsta.net/medias/nmedia/18/67/41/85/19057747.jpg ) . 
  a parody of the james bond genre . 
  ] ( http://fr.web.img6.acsta.net/medias/nmedia/18/36/07/69/18659413.jpg ) comedy about a knight and his servant who time-travel to 1993 . 
  again , most of the jokes are lost in translation , i guess . 
  in terms of actual bribes i 'd say pretty low . 
  in terms of conflicts of interest , high . 
  he has about a gazillion scandals by this point . 
  his campaign is basically going full trump . 
  he just says dumb populist shit . 
  i mean he used to do that but now he 's taking it up to eleven . 
  some of his proposals are downright dangerous . 
  i do n't know , somwhere i think that he did believe that he was building the socialist utopia . 
  then again , he twisted marxist thought so weirdly that it could hardly be called marxist anymore ( like that phrase where he says the soviet union needs to be the strongest form of state power so that it can ensure the `` withering away of the state '' ... ) . 
  they all were for the `` world revolution '' , even if stalin took up bukharin 's theory of `` socialism in one country '' . 
  then again , stalin also very successfully sowed the seeds of communist expansion in the world . 
  my point was that had trotsky been leader of the soviet union instead of being shafted by stalin , he would probably have been worse . 
  also lenin did n't have absolute power alone , he was more like `` just the first citizen '' . 
  he had to manage with all the tendencies of the bolsheviks . 
  stalin did n't either at first but then he outpoliticked everyone then purged them . 
   we have some nice stripclubs in copenhagen can confirm . 
  * looks down in shame *, 
  honestly i think trotsky was worse than lenin . 
  trotsky was the one who cracked down on the soviets , militarised the trade unions , and asked to step up the `` dictatorship '' . 
  he also hated lenin 's idea of the nep - he wanted communism to be applied directly and brutally * now * and fuck the consequences , lenin was much more pragmatic on that front . 
  hell stalin was more pragmatic early on than trotsky . 
  obviously . 
  at least they had some facial hair . 
  i think the worst is pretty much settled ~ ~ and it 's nicolas sarkozy ~ ~ . 
  for `` best '' , you could make an argument for winston churchill on many points . 
  or dag hammarskj\u00f6ld , really , even if he did n't a lead a country . 
  on the european level , jacques delors as president of the eu commission did the most to advance the eu . 
  montgomery will be more renowned because alamein , but if i 'm not mistaken slim was considered the superior commander . 
   scientists * ( not so many u fockin ' wot m8 ? 
  i 'd say paving the way for computers is a pretty big deal . 
  does n't the charter for the environment count ? 
  because calling a country a `` non-country '' is the true mark of a gentleman . 
  i used to date a british girl but she brexited , the `` distance '' and the expense of traveling every other weekend was becoming a bit too much for the both of us . 
  not a word , but the city blackburn just makes me chuckle immaturely ( in french , `` burnes '' is a slang word for balls ) . 
  just paris , nuke the rest of the ungrateful cow-fucking peasants for all i care . 
  true , but then again , we sometimes call french * la langue de moli\u00e8re * , or moli\u00e8re 's language . 
  * * douche \u00e9cossaise * ( scottish shower ) : a very cold shower * * filer \u00e0 l'anglaise * ( leave the english way ) : leave without telling anybody * * aller se faire voir chez les grecs * ( go get seen at the greeks ' ) : eh , i think it means `` fuck off '' or `` go get fucked '' . 
  * * le t\u00e9l\u00e9phone arabe * ( arab telephone ) : distorted rumours * * t\u00eate de turc * ( turk head ) : scapegoat * * aux calendes grecques * ( to greek calendes ) : putting off indefinitely * * les anglais d\u00e9barquent * ( the english are landing ) : menstruation * specifically used in alsace and moselle : * c'est toujours \u00e7a que les allemands / les boches auront pas !, 
  * ( at least that 's something the germans / the boches wo n't have ! ), 
  : said when somebody eats the last piece of food * * branlette espagnole * ( spanish wanking ) : nice name for a tittyfuck probably forgot a few and left out the racist ones . 
  also a guy who was convicted for fraud and had to exile himself to canada . 
  and from a left-wing view his programme is a bit ... bleh . 
  obviously hard to say but i do n't hate matthias fekl , our current junior minister for foreign trade . 
  a pretty smart guy with a bazillion diplomas ( including from the ecole normale sup\u00e9rieure , which is reserved to the best of the best of the best ) , and is actually kinda sorta left-wing . 
  also people should remember that beloved political figures of the past were , in their time , as controversial as figures today . 
  eh , zombie shows have lost their novelty , and even in twd you can see they 're really scraping the bottom . 
  i 'd love to see a fallout set in paris though . 
  weight and height , but the montparnasse tower predates those regulations i believe . 
  the tour first is n't in paris per se though . 
  * to not elect sarkozy . 
  * to enforce secularism at all levels , instead of pandering to religious minorities for votes as it happens in certain areas . 
  * reform state spending * reform payroll taxes * do n't elect sarkozy * stop with excessive foreign intervention - let 's concentrate where we can ( west africa ) . 
  no need for adventurist politics . 
  * somewhere down the line , leave nato 's integrated military command again . 
  * to not ratify ttip or ceta . 
  * actually return to the pre-sarkozy days of having an independent foreign policy and not being america 's lapdog * small one , but grant political asylum for edward snowden . 
  the tallest building in paris proper is [ the montparnasse tower ] ( https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/tour_montparnasse#/media/file:tour_montparnasse_view_arc.jpg ) with 210m . 
  it 's probably the most ugly thing ever conceived by human minds . 
  a common parisian saying is that the best view of the city is from the montparnasse tower because its the only place where you ca n't see it . 
  if you count the la d\u00e9fense business district , then it 's the [ tour first ] ( https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/tour_first#/media/file:tour_first.jpg ) which is 231m . 
  hillary clinton is definitely hawkish but not a unilateralist . 
  it 's fair to say , i think , that she would n't be like george w. bush in that regard - multilateralism is her thing , and let 's not forget she was a proponent of the deal with iran . 
  trump ... yeah , you could say he 's non-interventionist . 
  you could also remember his comments about `` i 'm going to bomb isis and take their oil '' . 
  or his general incompetence at foreign policy . 
  definitely helpful , but it was n't done out of pure kindness as some pretend . 
  marshall understood very well that impoverished european countries would be a breeding ground for communism . 
  also , a poor war-wrecked europe is n't a very good market for american companies . 
  the cults around elon musk and steve jobs are frightening . 
  enlightened people who scoff at personality cults in totalitarian regimes then go off to worship entrepreneurs .

  the whole thing is about the single market , the banking passport , and their right to refuse freedom of movement . 
  diplomacy has nothing to do with it , the uk will stay a close ally to the eu no matter what . 
   i want the uk to stay out of the eu anyway . 
  it acts like a trojan horse of the us within the eu . 
  you 're not wrong about that , but it was the only major country to ever advocated for turkey in the eu . 
  with the uk out , you lost your best ally in the eu . 
  and the eu will become stronger because as you said , the us was a trojan horse . 
  time to build an eu army and protect our borders without the need to even talk to erdogan . 
   why is every rabid leftist so hell bent on putting people that disagree with them down ? 
  lol . 
  what make you think that i 'm a leftist ? 
  if anything my comment should be considered conservative . 
  and you are the one insulting me here , tone it down . 
   everything is negotiable . 
  everything has a price . 
  the only question here , is are they going to pay whatever the eu ask them to , : - to stay in the single market , - to keep their banking passport , - and to keep france doing their borders patrol ? 
  this is going to be really , really expensive . 
  they know it and that 's why they want to stay in the eu . 
  but they ca n't , because they auto-fuck 'd themself with the referundum . 
  that 's exatly 100 % wrong , but you 're turk and you guys obviously have n't figured out how thing works in brussels . 
  there are rules and there are votes to make those rules . 
  if they leave the eu , they lose their votes but will have to comply to the rules because they still want access to the single market . 
  we are supposed to belive a shady lawyer because of what exactly ? 
  this dude is just wishful thinking , the uk is getting out of the eu . 
  and tbh , it would be kind of hilarous that the uk does not what was voted for because there are election in france and germany . 
  they voted to ` take back control ' of their policies and you 're going to tell them that you ca n't apply the referundum result because of what happen in foreign countries ? 
  gl to any politician trying this . 
  the only reason the penalties were there was because the uk was in the eu but as soon as you 're out , it 's not like we owe you anything . 
  we 'll make you pay for it . 
  if france made african countries pay for their illegal migrants , nobody would have to work there . 
   moving the border would seriously change cross channel trade/transport and not in a way that anybody wants . 
  you made it look twice like it 's going to damage the uk and france equally . 
  it 's just not true . 
  a shitload of trucks from all over europe , go through france to cross the chanel to get to you . 
  those who do it , do it because it 's cheaper than any other way . 
  if we start to slow , limit , close those borders you 're going to enjoy quite an inflation on your island . 
  long story short , you want a lot of things and the only thing you have to trade for them are your juicy banks . 
  [ it has already started .

  most of the immigration in the uk has always been from old british colonies , starting by india , and do n't get to the uk by crossing the rest of europe . 
  [ here ] ( http://metrocosm.com/global-immigration-map/ ) is an analysis from data given by the un . 
   in the brexit debate , the loudest arguments in favor of leaving the eu have been about immigration . 
  what strikes me as interesting is how small a portion of the uk 's net immigration is actually coming from europe . 
  [ uk 's immigation map ] ( http://i0.wp.com/metrocosm.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/uk-immigration.gif ) . 
  each dot represent 1000 people . 
  france does to the uk what turkey does to europe . 
  and i think hollande does n't want to scare the britishs right now , but as soon as the article 50 is triggered , things and talks are going to change drastically because : on one hand the uk : - want to stay in the european single market . 
  - want to keep european banking passport . 
  - want to keep their border in france and keep their cops do border patrol in france . 
  on the other , france : - ... is just going to try to squeez as much # # # as they can in the process . 
  and considering that they hold all the cards , it 's not going to be pretty for the uk . 
  there 's no friendship whatsoever when you leave the ship when things go sour . 
  in the end i think the uk is going to lose their european banking passport , are going to pay top $ $ $ their access to the singe market , will obviously lose their votes in brussels ... all this to be able to do border patrol in france . 
  the jokes is on you . 
  and the silliest thing about it , is that most of the immigration in the uk does n't even come from france or europe . 
  edit : y' all brits are cute to downvote me but it wo n't change the vote you made nor the fact that i am right . 
  i think french 's politicians are going to give all the cops in the area their new eve off in december 2018 . 
  it might happens sooner depending who is elected in 2017 or if a drama occures before that . 
  our system might be wrong , but we chose it . 
  we voted for it . 
  actually 2017 is going to be interesting because france and germany will have general elections . 
  things will change . 
  the eu as we know it might collapse or just drastically change . 
  and with the uk out of the picture , you lost you biggest leverage here . 
  you , on the other hand , your vote wo n't even matter . 
  it 's like hypno toad , watch the tv , bitch a little and in the end hillary-big business ticket is going to win . 
  but yeah smartboy , come over @ / r/europe mock our democracy . 
  nobody deserve that shit really and nobody asked for it . 
  i wish for trump to win the election , because the dude seams like an isolationist which is exatly what the rest of the world need . 
  last i checked , the usa wanted the uk to remain in the eu and turkey to join it . 
  then the usa wanted erdogan and assad gone , and they 're stronger than ever . 
  it looks like nobody gives 2 shits about you anymore . 
  this from an american is pure gold . 
  with your bs system , with the electoral college that make some people 's vote worth 7 times others , and swing states that pretty much decide for everything , you do n't even elect your president . 
  there 's nothing democratic about the american democracy . 
   on march 11 , 2003 republican u.s. 
  representatives bob ney and walter b. jones directed the three house cafeterias to change all references to french fries and french toast on menus , and replace them with freedom fries and freedom toast , respectively . 
  lol everytime you think the americans have reached the bottom of the retardness , you guys deliver and proove us wrong . 
  before that frenchs were just considered arrogants with holier-than-thou attitude but not much else . 
  after de villepin 's speach at the un , the usa had to prove there was a real threat and whatnot ( womd ) . 
  france refusal made things a lot more difficult for the us , and this is when the real hatred toward frenchs began . 
  i ca n't belive they 're letting this happen ... saoudi are the fucking problem in middle east , and they 'll become untouchable with nukes . 
  because the lower classes of the us are just plain retarded . 
  not only the lower classes actually . 
  the whole beef agains ' t france comes from france 's refusal to get involved in second gulf war , which was a fucking mistake . 
   saudi arabia trying to buy nukes from pakistan do you have sources for that ? 
  i think turkey is closer to get kicked out of nato and in open war agains ' t the west and/or russia than to getting into the eu . 
  do n't fool yourself turks , russia is not your friend either .

  is n't a motto of gulen 's movement : schools before mosque ? 
   kick turkey out of nato or something ... 
  i do n't know . 
  the usa will decide on that ... but they probably still need you for now for your airbase . 
  you 'll stay in nato for as long as you are more usefull than a problem , that 's how the usa always work .

  fair enough , i take it . 
  i was just pissed off . 
  44 % percent of the population live in menin !!, 
  they speak french , and because it 's memen and it 's flanders ( dutch speaking flanders ) , you think it 's ok to denied them the right to officialy use their language ?

  remind me of the `` old europe '' rant from bush 's administration .

  belgium as a whole is very dense ( 365 pop . / km2 ) . 
  in france it 's quite different , the nord d\u00e9partement ( lille by example ) is 449 pop . / km2 and loz\u00e8re is 15 !,

  check lille-roubaix-tourcoing , it 's as bright as belgium .

  i have to say i agree with him on the tuaregs 's part .

  i 'm happy to agree with an english for once ( do n't tell / r/rugbyunion ),

  i can find some similar in every countries : http://www.dumblaws.com/laws/international/france, 
  yeah no . 
  that 's not how it works in european countries , sorry mr erdogan . 
  but feel free to sponsor a song mocking us if you so want ... 
   and start lynching anyone above median income please  i do n't have a problem with people earning more , i have a problem with them looking for excuses to avoid ( what i think is ) normal taxes \\ ^ \\ ^ '' but you 're right , to each his own, 
   you seem to have a lot of faith in what good taxing the shit out of people does for society . 
  it 's not faith , it 's about the only way i know of redistributing wealth that does not end up in largescale damages when people are tired of being poor . 
   sure you need some taxes but no need to go berserk . 
  yeah sorry , right about that  and fuck the rich nonsense while working and living in the uk and enjoying the opportunities those filthy capitalist pigdogs have provided you . 
  home 's in france for me ; and we always had a long culture of `` fuck the rich '' as you say ;-) albeit with less camps and lakes of fire than the dprk i guess . 
  imho , it 's more about how the replacement will be acting . 
  yatsenuik did a nice job during a very dark period of ukrainian history . 
  other people would ` nt have done as good at the time . 
  now that things are peaceful ( edit : well a bit less insta death risk ) however who knows . 
  maybe he 'll ( volodymyr groysman ) manage to push more reforms . 
  plus he has no serious corruption attached to his name either afaik . 
  edit war time and peace time governments are very different ( and with ukraine there 's always the risk of worse people bth ), 
   tax avoidance is not illegal neither is bribery ( `` superpac '' ) in the usa  and frankly not even immoral imo . 
  uhhhh . 
  yes , yes it is . 
  76k could feed a dozen familly for a couple years . 
   good economics means not pissing away money when you do n't have to , that includes taxes . 
  good economy is having a budget first , and when 2/3 of it goes missing since 50 years because the money is untaxed and leave to panama or bahamas or ...  i suspect a lot of people would rather find creative ways to pass on their inheritance but , their kids might live in a third world country if they all do that . 
  when taxes do n't get paid , stuff like the nhs ( aka `` s\u00e9curit\u00e9 sociale '' in france . 
  you know the department tasked with keeping you alive ? 
  yes , that one ) and water companies will stop exisiting altogether . 
  it 's what happened in michigan in the usa , it 's what happened in greece , it 's what happends in country that do n't collect their taxes . 
  that 's a fast way to light a fire under your own kids . 
  but i guess people do n't care as usual, 
   if you do n't think people should be able to pass gifts tax free to their children then get rid of the tax relief on gifts . 
  well , i wish but i ca n't personally since i 'm french ( ~ ~ and it 's not worth a diplomatic incident to get in a fight for illegal action i guess ~ ~ ) , and neither can the protestors in front of his office : only the english gov can , which is headed , by , you get it , mr cameron ( but yes i do think he should ! ), 
   but that 's literally how taper relief on iht is meant to work . 
  he paid the taxes was required to by law . 
  spirit of the law vs letter of the law . 
   this is literally how taper relief works and what thousands of people do every year . 
  well if nobody pays taxes the system will be in trouble because a large fringe of the population is never going to have anything if the `` haves it '' never transfert anything back to the `` have not '' in the next generations ??? 
  forced partial redistribution ( aka taxes ) is pretty much the only tool to level the playfield at that scale edit ; as a side note  there are many reasons to dislike cameron . 
  this is reaching pretty hard . 
  i do n't dislike him ( but that 's not supposed to influence whether people pay or not !, 
  this is the difference between a state of law and a patronage system i guess . 
  people should pay their taxes in proportion of what they can and do contribute to society , not friendship sorry :d ) . 
  and you are right , this is a system issue , not really cameron 's . 
  altho he has `` some '' responsability in the sense that as a prime minister he 'd have serious influence upon such questions - even if i believe the decision is in the parliament 's hands ? - ; and my point there is people see it `` another guy in charge using his position to get the rich to weasle out '' ( regardless of that specific case not being really being that in truth ) ; the fact that until 2010 he helped some companies to avoid taxes , according to some , did not help either that perception, 
   had mr cameron received the half a million pounds in one lump sum he would have been liable to pay the inheritance tax because it would have been over the tax threshold of # 325,000 . 
  did n't he avoided a noticeable part of it ? 
  now do n't mind me , i obviously do n't wish anything bad on his family ( may they live long & well , like everyone else . 
  ) , but i do n't think the date of death ( or lack of ) should affect his taxes like that, 
  pay your taxes on that money !!, 
  hey , i was joking  which seems to be all too common on this sub . 
  in real life you mean :p, 
  says the country that still lives under royalty and speaks american / s edit  in another stinging attack , the presenter said the french government 's decision to fund the study of french in north african nations was akin to a `` form of imperialism '' . 
  coming from the country that still runs a `` commonwealth '' , that 's rich :d, 
  should n't that guy be in prison for bribery , theft , embezzlment , contribution in multiple conspiracy , bribing other officials , using slave labor in qatar and such ? 
  i also do n't think mr blatter contributed any significant actions toward the system that 'd justify any exceptional leniency . 
  so , the very least he could do at that point is get himself out of sight and business .

   will it include those inside the eu ? 
  or close to . 
  \\* looks at a certain mountain country fond of chocolate and clocks \\*, 
  even if they wo n't just quite yet join the eu anytime soon ( give it at least 10 , possibly 20/30 years before they 're actually ready for that ) ; the journey toward eu standards and economics and amplifying trade is pretty much their only way out of that giant economic mess right now . 
  well then , easy .

  erh . 
  i 'm afraid there is n't anything really new or interesting about russia in the leaks , no disrespect intended ( no matter how much some medias like foxnews love to spin it ) . 
  most of the interesting stuff is about corruption in western countries , and might be usefull to help clean our own house . 
   why would you keep all 3 in your office ? 
  eastern europe . 
  in ukraine they all did the same . 
  personnal safes and massive amounts of gold , diamonds , etc etc. 
  e.g : [ ukraine police find 42 kg of gold in home of ex-energy minister ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/ukraine-crisis-corruption-idusl6n0mj0cl20140322 ), 
   gypsies do n't do terrorism either , despite being considered a pariah in most european societies . 
  very interesting point . 
  altho some of their poorest fringe do tend to end up frequently associated to organized crimes , which probably does not help either, 
  it 's kind of an attenuating circumstances problems . 
  it does not excuse the problem or attitude of terrorists . 
  but working on it early before the incidents might help reducing incidents . 
  so , was it an air france bad decision or did the iranian asked for it ? 
  looks like the imf asked for even more austerity on top of that . 
  seems like there might be a few court martials in order . 
  if those acts are real they are a disgrace on our military . 
  i heard they got the culprit, 
  the most `` surprizing '' bit is probably this time it 's not germany 's fault ; it 's plainly the imf plotting by itself ( and going as far as planning to blackmail the ecb/germany to go even too far for them ), 
  i 'm just saying your source is not a source but simply confabulating what they want to see because they 're old religious fanatics that reject everything that happened after the french revolution . 
  not even the church use latin for anything here . 
   i 'm not talking about people speaking latin today . 
  i 'm talking about the use of latin in the catholic mass. 
  hey , my parents where catholics and dragged me at the time at the mass every we , and nobody used latin . 
  they sing stuff in languages they do n't understand regularly but that 's it . 
   i provided you with 2 links ( in french ) saying that latin was still used in the catholic mass up until 1965 except fore some \u201e innovative '' churches , it 's quite the contrary , priests that speak latin enough to even make mass with it is an exception there . 
   look ffs : il y a 50 an quoting la croix is like quoting donald trump as gospell : they 're a radical ultra conservative catholic newspaper that has royalists leanings . 
  unless you have nostalgia of a pre 1700 era france , that does n't mean anything . 
  i edited my post with more info  so no evidence , huh ?

  yeah , russian forces used to be organized into huge , unwieldy ww2 style divisions . 
  now they are organized into much smaller brigades , which make it easier to coordinate with various other attachments ( artillery , aircraft , logistics etc ) that modern armies require . 
  they also had `` skeleton divisions '' which had like 5 % of their notional strength or something that were intended to be kept ticking over until a big war kicked of and they 'd be filled with reservists . 
  they have mothballed tens of thousands of them . 
  ... that exactly what im talking about,

  the wording of the article `` seen by reuters '' suggests that a journo read the thing but has n't released it in full , or was n't able to keep the copy, 
  its an internal memo . 
  i do n't even understand why people are assuming that this is a concrete policy document and not a proposal of some kind . 
  talk about jumping to conclusions . 
  everyone seems to assume that the uk and france will handle any serious military action , with some help from others ( a few battalions , a few squadrons , whatever ) from a handful of other countries . 
  this seems to me to go against the principles of the eu - just because the uk and france can take on the burden on blood and treasure does n't mean they should . 
  they use the f-5s for interception , the f/a -18 s are apparently too expensive to keep on standby .

  witnesses can only tell you so much , and it will mostly be useless . 
  mate you 're being fucking ridiculous . 
  i 've not even mentioned the very possible factor that these buildings might not be high up enough for proper dispersal . 
  i highly doubt that assad 's helicopters would fly around at rooftop height , even if that was optimal for dispersal ( which it fucking is n't ) . 
  so in a warzone , with the streets deserted due to snipers and checkpoints everywhere , some cunts are just going to meander in carrying massive steel canisters with warning symbols all over them ? 
  you 're having a laugh . 
   the strongest are foreign mercenaries . 
  foreign interests will destroy the fighting spirit of the locals . 
  thanks for that cutting geopolitical insight there , friend . 
  you can deploy conventional chemical devices from a helicopter . 
  you can not do so from a building . 
  you really think no one is going to notice some dudes carrying massive fucking steel canisters up the stairs ? 
  these areas are held by the rebels , not `` contested '' . 
  you have no idea how nerve gas works . 
  sorry , there 's no kind way of putting it . 
  not to mention eyewitness accounts tell of rockets falling and canisters being dropped from helicopters . 
  nerve gas does n't just magically disperse when you blow up it 's storage containers . 
  in fact in many cases , the chemical components of the stuff are stored separately and are mixed just before use . 
  in some very advanced munitions they are mixed in the actual warhead . 
   it 's seems to me you 're belittling the pain and suffering that conventional weapons can cause . 
  not at all . 
  it 's a simple moral calculus : look at the pain and suffering caused by conventional munitions , and multiply it a hundredfold to get a sense of the potential horrors that nerve gas can inflict . 
   if we ignore this and only react when chemical weapons are used i 'd say we have a pretty fucked up moral compass . 
  i sort of agree , but at the same time you have to consider that mortars , artillery , tanks etc are much more widespread throughout syria . 
  due to its volatile nature nerve agents will likely be concentrated at certain storage sites/specially trained units , making it easier for us to locate and secure or destroy . 
  and if it has been widely distributed , well , then we 're even more fucked than we thought . 
   and if he continues to use conventional weapons , tens of thousands will continue to suffer and die in a matter of months . 
  which , awful as it is , would allow us at least some time to try and effect change through negotiation and diplomatic pressure . 
  it 's not nice , but it is the least worst option if it is available . 
  chemical weapons do n't afford us that luxury . 
  although to be honest everyone 's been doing a piss poor job on the diplomatic front too . 
   attempt what ? 
  you 're the one advocating action , what kind of action exactly ? 
  i 'm not an expert in this sort of thing , but rest assured that the militaries of various countries have been developing procedures on how to deal with chemical weapons for decades now . 
  hopefully we have some options that would allow us to destroy chemical weapons stocks , or figure out when they are about to be deployed and destroy the delivery systems . 
   would n't it simply be possible for some rebel group to plant a few canisters around the area and remote detonate them ? 
  it 's also literally impossible . 
   what does it matter that it 's with poison gas ? 
  is killing with conventional weapons ok now ? 
  chemical weapons are far more serious than conventional weapons , which is why there are treaties expressly forbidding their use even in wars in which conventional weapons are being used . 
  if assad decided to use his chemical weapons more liberally tens of thousands would die in a matter of days . 
   and what about the rebels who are also executing and beheading people not even affiliated with al-asad 's regime ? 
  so that means we should n't even attempt anything ? 
   the way you 're talking it 's as if this was a white and black issue when it 's all just different shades of grey . 
  what an utterly meaningless thing to say at this point . 
  in this context this sentence is pointless . 
  you do n't actually care about this issue , all you want to do is find the easiest way to appear superior/more intelligent to everybody else . 
   i personally think that we should be sitting on our hands till there 's clear proof that the assad regime was in fact behind this attack . 
  i would honestly not be surprised if it was a false-flag operation by one of the numerous rebel groups . 
  people on reddit keep saying this , but how ? 
  the rebels do n't have helicopters , and there are eyewitness accounts on canisters being dropped from helicopters . 
  they do n't have artillery rockets or cannons large enough to disperse the gas either . 
  so when everything is going smoothly we 're all too willing to talk about the eu having great influence in the mediterranean , being a positive force to improve people 's lives in the region .

  i mean , what was the last really good historical film we had ? 
  * un long dimanche de fian\u00e7ailles * , which is a great film but mainly a sob fest about wwi . 
  so people called grossenweindenf\u00fcller or giacomazzoletti or bixente urrutia or guivar ` ch lagadec or rickwaert or schlomo ben soussan are all `` ethnically french '' huh ? 
  say , what about people from guadeloupe , martinique or guyane who are mainly black ? 
  they 've been french way longer than quite a few white french people . 
  whta about them ? 
  there is no definition of ethnic french . 
  it 's just not measured . 
   unless it calls directly for violence , which denying the holocaust does not . 
  holocaust denial is 100 % linked to neo-nazism , which , you know , does call for violence . 
  the eastern half of the roman empire lasted from 476 to 1453 . 
  the narrative that it was just 1000 years of decline and just decadence is mind-bogglingly wrong when you think about it . 
  yet it 's the main view people have about it . 
  there 's also a fair bit of orientalism into it due to edward gibbon - see they were n't * really * manly strong men like the west , they were eastern , sensual , effete , they had women and eunuchs managing the whole thing , they preferred diplomacy and espionnage to war , it was all just palace intrigue and weak intellectualist disputes ... that whole lot of subconscious clich\u00e9s is sort of there in general . 
  in the books there 's not really a charge down the hill at helm 's deep , it 's more like the rohirrim drive the orcs from the hornburg , then the huorns arrive , then gandalf and erkenbrand arrive with footsoldiers . 
  yeah , there 's generally a begrudging acceptance that they called themselves romans and were technically the roman empire `` but we 'll still call them byzantines just because roman empire = rome and the west '' . 
  also i think this is why justinian is the most celebrated emperor of this era , because he tried to reclaim the west . 
  there 's a bias there . 
  historians specialising in byzantium generally seem to consider him overrated and talk more about people like anasthasius , leo iii , basil ii , the komnenoi ... ah but they did n't try to retake the west so clearly they must be minor !, 
  this despite , say , basil ii or nikephoros phokas being one of most badass emperors , worthy of being at the same table as trajan or hadrian . 
  iirc the monophysites were n't really considered heretics and were rarely killed . 
  hell , justinian was pretty anti-monophysite yet he did n't bother theodora who was a monophysite . 
  however there were temporary moves to restrict or repress monophysite worship , yeah . 
  also the monophysite issue is one of the factors that made the arab conquest of syria and egypt possible but not really the main one . 
  it was n't that theodosius , the walls were built after him . 
  they 're named theodosian walls because of the boy emperor theodosius ii . 
  the dude who you should be thanking is the praetorian prefect of the east , anthemius , who had them built . 
  i think the siege of vienna in 1683 is one of tolkien 's main inspirations for pelennor fields . 
  though minas tirith also seems to be inspired by constantinople in many ways . 
  theophanes the confessor , one of our sources for this part of roman history , writes at the end of his account of the siege ( paraphrasing from memory ) : * `` our foes learnt , by untold suffering of their own making , that god , the saviour and the holy virgin watched over this city and the empire of the christians '' . 
  most people remember the battle of tours ( or of poitiers ) in 732 as the moment when ummayad conquests were finally checked , but in reality the first big blow to the caliphate happened earlier , in 717 , when the arabs besieged constantinople , the capital of their mortal enemy , the roman empire . 
  in the end the arabs were decisively defeated thanks to the roman navy 's use of liquid fire , also thanks to the winter of 717 that was incredibly harsh , and thanks to the arrival of the bulgars who routed the remaining arabs . 
  ( if any of this sounds familiar , the siege is the direct inspiration for the battle of the blackwater in game of thrones ) . 
  it 's interesting to think about what would 've happened if constantinople had fallen in the early 8th century . 
  the caliphate could 've spread in southeastern europe , then in the rest , centuries before it did irl , with absolutely incalculable consequences . 
  in the end , the roman victory at constantinople is probably one of the most decisive battles in world history , but has been oddly forgotten in the west . 
  also , the remains of the arab armies and fleets retreated across the mediterannean ... only to get wrecked again when they got hit by a storm ... then again when santorini erupted ... and finally when they arrived in syria , they were greeted by the plague . 
  if anyone is interested in this period of roman history , there 's a great podcast called [ the history of byzantium ] ( https://thehistoryofbyzantium.com/ ) that you should listen to . 
  the story of the siege of constantinople is told in [ this ] ( https://thehistoryofbyzantium.com/2015/03/31/episode-69-lost-to-the-west/ ) great episode , which can be listened to as a standalone . 
  okay , creating the usa was the bigger mistake . 
  ha , never played hoi , paradox games are way too hard for me . 
  it 's just that i consider the munich agreements as probably the biggest single terrible mistake in our history . 
  we should 've declared war in 1938 over the sudetenland issue , tbh, 
  when you ask `` which country is winning '' you 're thinking with the assumption of a zero-sum game . 
  the answer to `` who is winning ? '', 
  in free trade is always `` everyone '' . 
  because you 're under the delusion that trade is a zero sum game where one has to win and the other has to lose , because one side will have an overall trade deficit . 
  but having a trade deficit does n't mean losing , and it is n't a bad thing per se . 
  the facts to back it up are : the entirety of economics and trade theory since the 18th century , as well as the situation of many prosperous countries with large trade deficits . 
  in a country with the trade deficit , the consumers benefit from cheaper and/or better goods , which gives them more money to spend elsewhere , which is otherwise good for the economy . 
  i should add that looking at an overall deficit does n't make too much sense - after all , a given country will import some stuff and export other stuff . 
  all sectors are not impacted in the same way . 
  an `` equal deal '' does n't mean anything , unless you mean that only if country a exports x$ of goods it should import x$ of goods as well - kinda goes against the idea of free trade , supply and demand , encourages rent-seeking , and is n't very applicable in reality ( take the uk and germany ... the uk imports a massive amount from germany , but the uk has ** relatively ** much less to offer by way of exports that would interest germans . 
  therefore the only way to ensure your version of an `` equal deal '' is to restrict german imports , which amounts to really bad protectionism ... ), 
  nobody 's answering your question because your question is nonsensical . 
  the usa is not `` losing '' from its trade with europe , europe is not `` winning '' from it , and the same applies to japan . 
  you do n't `` win '' at trade . 
  it 's not a zero-sum game . 
  both sides benefit , and trade deficits are not inherently good or bad . 
  countries like the uk , canada or australia have large trade deficits but maintain high standards of living , dynamic economies , etc. 
  that 's ... not how trade works . 
  itt : neckbeards screeching `` breed for the fatherland ! '', 
  teh homogays obviously, 
  it seems absolutely baffling that it was legally forbidden not so long ago in so many countries . 
  not just looked down upon , but illegal . 
  oh , i 've no doubt the 51st state will do its best . 
  and with an honoured place in the pantheon in paris !, 
  you mean * marie curie * , 
  also honoria had the hots for attila the hun and sent him a love letter . 
  attila used this to claim his right to rule the western roman empire . 
  [ totally fine . 
  ] ( http://www.csmonitor.com/world/middle-east/2015/1115/dozens-detained-in-g20-summit-protests-in-turkey ), 
  when was that ? 
  g7 , g8 , g20 meetings and summits have always attracted these protests . 
  you just violated the nap, 
  we literally just sent a tripwire force to estonia . 
   byzantine fuck yuo is of true roman empire !, 
  germans get out reeeeeee, 
  for the consumer cheaper goods means you have more income to do other stuff . 
  for companies it 's anoter good export opportunity . 
  accepting gay people does n't decrease your natality . 
  gay is n't a disease people can catch , you know . 
  unless you happen to see idris elba nude , in which case you do catch the gay . 
  homosexuality was legal here since 1791 , get on our fabulous level . 
  trade is not a zero-sum game . 
  both parties enjoy benefits of free trade . 
  the `` you can win only if i lose '' just does n't apply . 
  mainly because of how it handles disputes and settlements i believe . 
  thank whoever built the tour first , before that the tallest building was * shudder * the montparnasse tower . 
  created the fifth republic , led a lot of the reformation of modern institutions , brought the country back to its feet after the war , managed decolonisation , nuclear power , national independence policy , franco-german friendship , saying fuck you to the usa , etc. 
  fair . 
  but if we * had * to answer the question we 'd probably say clovis just as the germans might say otto or the british might say alfred or william the conqueror . 
  meh , clovis was the first rex francorum , made paris the capital , the line of kings starts with him , etc. 
  charlemagne mainly because if there 's an `` official '' date of birth it 's 843 with the verdun ( ! ), 
  treaty that created francia occidentalis and francia orientalis . 
  clovis , charlemagne , a bunch of revolutionaries , napoleon and charles de gaulle i guess . 
  my own opinion on this is that we should look into the insane complexity of tax optimisation , work on a common corporate tax base , but then let member states fix the rax rate freely . 
  the oppressive policy that there 's an official language that everyone should know and that 's also the one in use by the government and state services ? 
  `` what is a nation state '', 
  english will probably remain the main language in practice of the eu but the eu has 24 official working languages , and that probably wo n't change .

  nice job capturing her alive, 
   this is either a publicity stunt ( most likely ) , or a play to get cheap labor how about a bit of both ? 
  ~ ~ empty space in portugal , duly noted !, 
  muhahaha ~ ~, 
  seems legit ; oh well they might as well do it at night with your glorious tornados that ca n't fly in the dark :d, 
   but not the answer . 
  as long as tens of thousands flee fighting there will be refugee waves  we did have a chance of a military intervention for more than 3 years , but with russia joining assad that is not a viable possibility anymore . 
  oh we are , with the sdf in the north ( coalition ) and on a diplomatic plan too  people are fleeing from assad as of now they 're mostly fleeing fighting . 
  i mean , numbers of people will flee assad yeah but not by the millions either ( those who wanted to do so did a year ago or hide in turkey in the north ) . 
  it 's partly the french answer to the ddg 1000 that totally was n't making us salivate !, 
  but without the bow mounted laser but at 1/6 of the price, 
  macedonia is working on closing borders ( i think they did it a week ago ), 
   this type moral grandstanding is particularly funny coming from france where alstom has recently been caught yeah , by french personnal . 
  we did n't waited for a foreign country to barge in and denounce them ; and did n't destroyed another country 's economy to line up our pockets since the ( de ) colonization  thales in bribing its way through malaysia , who are a company partially owned by the government , interesting ; thanks for the tip edit : annnnnd it looks like we 're opening a probe to punish the culprits edit : would you look at that , it appears sarkozy at least knew about it . 
  xd damn it he really touched everything . 
  well ; i 've been digging a bit around and turns out even accounting that it 's brand new and latest tech ~ ~ or at least it 's monkey version likely ~ ~ the price look quite a bit inflated at 17 ' 000 ' 000 $ ( 17 millions ) per tank . 
  for example , looking at ukraine , they are refurbishing old cis tanks for around 5 million a piece for a fully renovated oplot tank full export marked-up price . 
  of course , it 's not `` new '' ( factory fresh ) ; but half the parts on the hull are and in case of a turkey/greece spat ; it 's not `` more high tech '' that 's going to change anything since tanks ca n't cross sea bodies ; they 'd need large numbers to have some on every islands and air strikes would play a large role ( and if you get bombed by a plane , whether it 's a leopard or a t90 or a t64 and you get a 500kg tb round on your head from a couple km above , you 're going to be dead anyway ) . 
  so ; looking at the 17 ' 000 ' 000 $ / unit price to a bankrupt ~ ~ african state ~ ~ euro country , it 's likely 80 % of that price is corruption-induced hallucination ( commonly called `` theft '' ) . 
  so if i were greece : - i 'd ask germany to either recover their tanks and fully refund or fully deduce it from ongoing debts . 
  - or offer to keep them in exchange for a `` mere '' 80 % refund ( knowning it 's still a large mark up from real prices and ridiculously and abusively high ) - use some of that money to buy second hand tanks to fullfill their defense needs - use the remaining saved billions euros to reinvest more usefully in their country . 
  - and if ( when ) germany refuse to give anything and play dead ; ~ ~ rewriting all the money back to greece and some more ~ ~ thinking of bringing it to the stockholm arbitration court . 
  edit : woops one too many zeros . 
  greece paid the tanks 17 millions per unit which is still more than 3 time their value , not 170 million . 
  they could never have afforded that much anyway / s, 
  both are responsible . 
  if i go to your parents , tell them i will give them 100 $ if they give me 2000 $ of your money in exchange for some random whatever junk , you think i 'd be innocent ? 
  this is exactly what happened . 
   we need a long term solution on how to deal with refugees , immigration and border control . 
  we do , but you 're not going to like the answer : the current problem at the source of that crisis is the civil war in syria & libya . 
  we 're still fighting the first one and trying to look for solutions with the rebels and syrian governement . 
  problem is the islamists are nowhere near dead yet ; and raqqah 's still in their hands . 
  once that will be addressed we 'll need to bring at least a facsimile of order in libya too to close the border and road there too . 
  and it 's going to take time : /, 
  tha kind of systemic corruption you see in the topic is largely responsible too for leading some countries like greece where they are today ; extreme poverty . 
  when government money is stolen 2 billions at a time ... 
  how much of the population and surface of europe do austria and germany represent ? 
  but it 's true germany do more than it 's fair share with refugees ; france could maybe do a bit more ; remind me to poke our own gov a bit once the calais situation is addressed, 
  well which is why we should have an eu wide tax fraud/evasion crackdown , not ignore it, 
   i do n't even wan na know how much tax they manage to avoid . 
  well you should ; because if all multinationals paid their taxes honestly the various states could pay every europeans 2000 $ / mo of welfare on top of their other income and there would still be wads of cash to spare . 
  it 's well within the `` not funny at all anymore '' , 
   no need , they ( well , the top guys ) got caught in the end . 
  glad to hear it  alright  especially as german colleagues used to crack jokes about corruption in romania ( which was also true , of course ) . 
  i can imagine haha, 
   i 'm not saying our own corruption is okay . 
  i am saying that a corruption is so established in some countries that companies actually consider it an operating cost . 
  if you checked , i am sure most of the multinational corporations working in indonesia use bribes too . 
  and that mentality is how you end up poor like indoniesia , ukraine or russia , despite the last two actually having more industries than you . 
  because if you tolerate them stealing from others , how much do you think they steal from you , german tax payer , with your own tax money at arm 's length ? 
  `` ho they would never dare ! '', 
  right ? 
   this is how many germans see business , unfortunately . 
  and burglars see business as emptying your home . 
   they had a fund set aside to bribe officials in italy ( and other countries ) , and many german colleagues did n't think it was a big deal . 
  `` it is the italians who are corrupt , we are just doing business '' . 
  how about you send all that stuff to the anti corruption agency ? 
   they actually thought they were being upstanding citizens , and did n't really understand what was so wrong about it . 
  it was kind of cute . 
  yeah . 
  welcome to ~ ~ eastern europe ~ ~ post 80 's occident . 
   then the contract should be annulled and the money paid back . 
  i agree , germany should refund greece those 1 ' 700 ' 000 ' 000 $ they grabbed by corruption . 
  or at least write it off entirely from the debts . 
  but watch how the excuses will fly and they 'll never pay it anyway . 
   you know that multinational business often have extra funds they keep just to bribe local officials because they know otherwise nothing will ever get done ? 
  i would n't be surprised if a lot of business did n't have these for greece . 
  `` they 're all corrupt and more than us so our own corruption is totally ok !, 
  also whatabout greek corruption ''  the difference is that on one side we had german businessmen acting as businessmen will so if a company decide to burglarize at people 's home they do fullfill their main objective too : making money . 
  i fail to see how that make it legal . \u00b2, 
  ahah watch the german defending germany 's right to bribe and corrupt it 's way . 
   the company does what its supposed to do , sell their products . 
  so if a company decide to burglarize at people 's home they do fullfill their main objective too : making money . 
  i fail to see how that make it legal . 
   austria declared it will allow in no more than 3,200 refugees a day , regardless of whether they intend to go to germany or apply for asylum in austria , and will introduce a daily limit of 80 asylum requests . 
  those are pretty reasonable numbers in reality ( from an humanitarian point of view ) ; intended to decrease flow . 
  if people realise it 's starting to bottleneck , word will spread back of it, 
  okay . 
  but debriefing/trial/jail on arrival . 
  wtf . 
  hey you 're kind of going against the cause and definitely not helping yourself . 
  there 's plenty of real drowning so please do n't add false ones to it . 
  you 're not saving much , and subsidizing yourself with only a couple billions likely wo n't fix an integrated economy that has just kind of shot itself in the foot ; but that 's just my 2 cents . 
  but oh well it 's the uk 's choice and if your economy survived blair & tatcher , you 're likely going to survive it anyway ... 
  erh . 
  they could get a free trade agreement either way ; and poland certainly is n't by any mean the poorest eu state . 
  that would probably be greece currently ( seriously , when people ran from greece to romania , you know the country is totally fucked ) , and with for example ( not in exact order but ... ) at least croatia/slovakia/romania / hungaria/bulgaria ; and moldova # 1 poorest when they might join it . 
   so i ca n't see the eu making trade difficult just to say `` i told you so '' you largely overestimate how much we 'd care about `` revenge '' just because the uk want to go their own separate way . 
  we 'd keep an eye on the visas and treatment of eu citizens tho ( welfare , visas ) edit : and tax fraud , but i suspect that 'd be all . 
  there 's a lot of other `` countries that annoys us all to death '' on the short list to strangle with sanctions wayyyy before the uk . 
  well yeah . 
  that whole topic is speculation as far as we all know . 
  that 's kind of the point :-p, 
  well . 
  it depends on what measures and relation they have toward the eu i guess . 
  - if they ask for visas from the eu , the eu will ask the same - if they ask for tariffs , so will we - if they cut all welfare to eu passeports holders after leaving the eu ; there 's a serious reciprocate risk too - let alone if they start deporting poles `` that steal all our jerbs and welfare '' ; we 'd likely start refusing just as much uk visas arbitrarily threats apart ; it 's likely we 'd establish a free trade agreement . 
  the post-cameron torries tho will likely want to seal their border on the incoming side to stop what they perceive as an invasion . 
   who will be affected the most ? 
  my guess would be anybody hoping to travel and/or settle to and from the uk ; or anybody that has to ask for social funding/help/welfare / unemployment/nhs . 
  and anyone affected by regulations they will want to repeal because they see them as `` eu led intrusion on our sovereignty '' .

  de gaulle played a great role for france during wwii as he managed to save some of the country 's honour and make france one of the victors . 
  he could be seen by french people as kind of similar to churchill in this regard . 
  the difference is that de gaulle also played a significant role during the end of the 1950s and 1960s , establishing a new constitution and becoming president , acted as a benevolent monarch , took france out of a bloody war , made france a nuclear power and established new foundations for the country 's right . 
  churchill had an impressive legacy during wwii , but his time as prime minister during the 1950s was n't really memorable for the uk . 
  also , despite never equaling its prowess , de gaulle never had the blood churchill had on its hands , which means that his legacy is n't really tainted even to this day . 
  his opponents are usually merely opposed to his conservatism . 
  germany had a great statesman with konrad adenauer . 
  still , he led western germany during a time where the country had to keep a low profile , so there 's that . 
  also , germans had become warry of any kind of providential leader ( even if they have * mutti * now ) . 
  france loves its providential leaders . 
  de gaulle became the right 's role model , whereas mitterrand became the socialist party 's role model . 
  documents released in 1998 by the german chancellery called * dokumente zur deutschlandpolitik . 
  sonderedition aus der akten des bundeskanzleramted 1989/1990 * are a prime source , as it contains the german reports of meetings between mitterrand and kohl . 
  they are not exhaustive though , and the release and the sorting have been made in order to show a positive image of helmut kohl , during a difficult campaign . 
  according to them , mitterrand was n't very supportive of a german reunification like the us , but was n't opposed to it . 
  kohl also published his memoirs in which he describes his `` friend '' mitterrand as `` lacking a clear strategy '' regarding franco-german relationship , being under the influence of roland dumas , the french foreign minister . 
  according to kohl , mitterrand made the same bet as margaret thatcher , which was that gorbatchev would never accept a german reunification . 
  tilo schabert , a german historian , had access to the french presidential archives of this period . 
  he 's the main source you can read on the subject . 
  he published a book called * mitterrand and the german reunification : a secret history ( 1981-1995 ) * . 
  the french archives are more nuanced on the french position than the german archives say so . 
  in bonn in october 1982 and in bad-kreuznach in october 1984 , mitterrand said to kohl that a german reunification should be prepared , as he was imagining it happening `` before the end of the century '' . 
  kohl rejected mitterrand 's idea of an early reunification . 
  mitterrand 's main problem was that according to him , a reunified germany was n't going to be a bigger switzerland . 
  germany would become a natural power . 
  as germany is located between the western and the estern bloc , mitterrand feared them playing both the soviet union and the us , leaving france in an unconfortable place . 
  he also feared a reconciliation between the us and the soviet union , leaving european countries in the cold . 
  in both cases , he wanted germany to be closely tight within european institutions , becoming a power within this international construction . 
  he also wanted a strong europe . 
  in order to attach germany to european institutions , he tried to get them more involved in the european policy of defense , including a military space program . 
  in 1985 , germany did n't want to be more involved in said space program . 
  therefore , the french position shifted from defense and foreign policy toward the monetary union , while germany wanted to strenghen the political union before acting on a monetary union that was poorly seen by the german public . 
  france wanted germany 's agreement to a planned schedule for the conference that would launch the monetary union . 
  kohl kept delaying the scheduling of this conference , which was worrying the french president , as he wanted to prevent germany going its own way . 
  france wanted a sign that germany was n't going its own way with the reunification and remained strongly attached to europe , so germany compromised on scheduling the conference , which led to the euro . 
  mitterrand had mainly two conditions to the german reunification : * reunification had to be wanted by gdr * germany had to agree on the german-polish border , in order to prevent a modern german irredentism . 
  kohl made tradeoffs because he had to reassure their allies . 
  in the same way , kohl [ offered thatcher a secret access to his reunification plans ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/dec/30/helmut-kohl-margaret-thatcher-reunification-plans-national-archives-files ) . 
  thatcher was strongly opposed to the german reunification , but the british government quickly came to the conclusion that they would n't be able to prevent it , and therefore being nice to the germans was in their interest . 
  still , she was n't personnally a big fan of german reunification . 
  she said to mitterrand during a private breakfast on 2 june 1992 : `` germany is even more dangerous since the reunification . 
  it is rebuilding its empire ... 
  the nazis are now in the community , and you reunified them !, 
  `` masculinity '' and `` independence '' in foreign relationship are antithetical unless you are the big dog . 
  i 'm not flabbergasted by georgia 's or ukraine 's current state of masculinity and independence . 
  i did the math wrong because i stopped in 2029 instead of 2030 . 
  the average growth rate needed would be 3.7 % . 
  i 'm eager to see that . 
  according to this `` source '' , the uk will have a gdp of about $ 4.622 trillion by 2030 . 
  the uk would need to sustain above 4 % growth per year on average to achieve that . 
  a rate unheard of since the 1980s even as a short spike . 
  it 's obviously deluded . 
  money of course , but it only explains why their leaders are pro-russia . 
  their supporters are also fond of putin because of an admiration for strong leaders , hard power , a disgust for democratic behavior like discussion , rule of law and tradeoffs . 
  note how the eu embodies the exact opposite of this : no strong leader , soft power instead of hard power , trying to increase democratic behavior within itself , discussion , rule of law and tradeoffs at its core . 
  it conveniently happens that putin is also one of the eu 's biggest opponent . 
   her supporters and other idiots will claim that she is very much a gaullist . 
  they used to despise de gaulle because he did n't keep algeria french , calling him `` a traitor '' . 
  i 've even met some of them claiming that de gaulle 's behavior during wwii was a shameful betrayal , and that the vichy regime rightfully sentenced him to death in august 1940 . 
  nowadays , they might claim that marine le pen is a gaullist in order to work toward the fn 's normalization process . 
  florian philippot , fn 's number 2 , claims that he 's himself a gaullist . 
  at the same time , jean-marie le pen , the party 's founder , called him a `` socialo-gaullist '' , which was an insult in his mind . 
  people like st\u00e9phane ravier , another fn 's leader , mayor in marseille 's 7th arrondissement and senator called de gaulle `` a felon general '' a year ago . 
  this party is schizophrenic . 
  he 's just jealous of oliver kahn 's hair . 
  we wo n't receive the same treatment this side of the rhine for [ obvious reasons ] ( http://m.chinadaily.com.cn/en/img/attachement/jpg/site1/20160706/f8bc1269fd8318e6b6df28.jpg ) . 
  time for an anecdote . 
  i personally know a french history teacher that got hurt during a school trip in poland ( fell in a hole while visiting auschwitz ... ) . 
  she went to a polish hospital , where the doctor or surgeon wrote a letter explaining what he saw on x-ray for the french surgeon that would operate her after transportation . 
  she had broken her leg . 
  the polish doctor did n't speak english nor french . 
  so , he wrote the letter in latin . 
   i just wonder how those raw numbers will translate into combat effectiveness . 
  i think that the main problem is n't there . 
  our main problem is combat * willingness * of our respective governments . 
  true . 
  as a share of gdp , it 's decreasing , according to the [ same source ] ( https://www.kingsfund.org.uk/blog/2015/10/nhs-spending-squeezed-never ) as your link . 
  shares of gdp is the figure to look for in order to compare social policies and healthcare between countries . 
  this trend is n't aimed at spiting the eu . 
  it 's already going on since years , which is why this so-called `` threat '' seems believable . 
  the eu will just be used as an excuse to keep doing the same thing . 
  they already `` agreed '' on significant university fees and reduced spendings on nhs , among other shifts to their social policies . 
  schools becoming `` academies '' could be interpreted as a step toward privatization , at least to some extent . 
  at the same time , corporate tax rate has been steadily decreasing . 
  british people voted for the tories again . 
  the opposition seems weak despite this trend . 
   you do realise that cutting cooperation tax does not necessarily lead to reduced corporation tax receipts . 
  yes you get less from individual companies but you get more companies basing themselves in your country . 
  you are right , it does n't if your country is small enough . 
  hence why every single tax haven is either a small country or a microstate . 
  the uk is n't a small country nor a microstate . 
  the cost of nhs alone is often superior to the gdp of a typical tax haven ( 4 times bigger than panama 's gdp for example , more than a hundred times bigger than british virgin islands ' gdp ) or not that far from the gdp of a small country with low corporate tax like ireland . 
  cutting corporation tax in the uk wo n't lead to increased tax receipts . 
  you 'd need an impossibly huge amount of corporations relocating there to overcome the cut . 
  it will lead to lower tax receipts , and thus lower spendings , hence why philip hammond says that the uk is ready to shift its social system if needed . 
   there are productivity benefits i can believe that , but what about the problem where we all have the same amount of cash for the same buildings we want to rent . 
  the rent goes up , ca n't this be tested ? 
  if we still have to work in big cities despite universal income , then obviously this income will be swallowed by mortgages and renting . 
  in france we have a form of housing benefit aimed mainly at poor people ( not extremely poor , just below average ) that are renting . 
  for example , it can be about 170 $ for a student per month , or 220 $ for a poor worker .

  not at the same level than russia , of course , but you ca n't brush thoses people under the rug . 
  culturally , they represent french culture just as much as i do . 
  and if you go back a little , you will see that percentage getting higher and higher . 
  and i 'm pretty sure that 's the exact same thing for any culture on earth , that `` machismo '' you 're talking about . 
  if you disagree , please , give me some sources . 
  so yes , it is n't just about who 's in office , and by the way , please note ** that 's not what i said at all ** ( so that 's a strawman . 
  and if hollande was n't elected , then no gay marriage in france , another thing you should n't willingfully ignore like it 's nothing . 
  anyway , saying it 's their culture it 's just lazy and just another cheap jab at russia . 
  i disagree with thoses policies , but let 's not be hypocrites here . 
  i would n't say discrimination against gay is really part of the russian culture , since it 's something happening in a lot of other places . 
  when we passed the law in france , we got religious people protesting against it , the difference is just who is in office ... well , that , with its share of statistic , and all . 
  anyway , to answer , no , not that much , but my guess is that you do n't know a lot yourself . 
  dude , i 'm pretty sure they fully expected that , and did it anyway ... that 's the point of it . 
  not really ? 
  it 's not like the police shot thoses guy , so not `` all '' i will take my downvotes and see myself out . 
  is n't that song more critical toward the current generation than in his honor ?

  india has like 9 times the population russia has , from what i know , i would say their relationship are friendly , and they are doing business together , but not like india was under russian influence . 
  the indians just chose the better planes . 
   selling planes to india is a mixed bag . 
  what do you mean by that ? 
   i 'll take the plane planes * , there are 56 of them, 
  and freedom fries . 
  v for vendetta would be a better example , since children of men 's plot is based on the inability of the people to make childrens . 
  silly greek naming their country like that stuff fat people are made of . 
  well , france is n't norway . 
  we have one of the most powerful army in the world , nukes , and a permanent seat at the un security council . 
  it 's like we are ought to show off a bit ... what surprises me is that the us does n't hold parades like that . 
  we do it , the uk too . 
  russia and china ? 
  yup .

  cold war ii ? 
  i think the ussr would have won without the uk and the us . 
  yes , the us economical support was really important , but it just shortened the war . 
  if it was a case of normal warfare , and that the german treated the local population humanely , maybe the ussr would have negocied peace after its first defeat , but seeing what the german did ? 
  no way , the ussr would have fought to the last man if it needed to . 
  and we saw what a geared up ussr can do . 
  would have been such a bloodier conflict . 
  upvoted for fact . 
   and america won the cold war more like the ussr lost it . 
  like we needed the eu to tell us that it 's bad . 
  googled it and got a district of berlin . 
  am i missing the joke ? 
  with `` combien coute '' , i got a car related thing ( car registration document and the test , bsr , you have to pass before getting it ) . 
  not even close to complex . 
  they could have explained a bit better though . 
  one paragraph would be enough , or just the formula and what each term stands for . 
  what supercarriers ? 
   i did n't downboat you . 
  i do n't downvote people on reddit . 
  it 's pathetic . 
  oh , so it was n't you ? 
  i just assumed since it happened rather quickly . 
   sure , they 'd be `` technically right '' if they called them human too . 
  the bbc and the rest of the liberal press describe them as `` asian '' because do otherwise would be to open themselves up to the accusation of racism . 
  which as we know , is one of the more heinous crimes . 
  protecting community relations is more important than preventing them raping underaged girls . 
  i agree , it 's totally fucked up . 
  i 'm more on the left than right , but would be more or less centrist . 
  it annoy the hell out of me when things get too politically correct . 
   oh . . one other thing . 
  there are some people in the uk who describe indians/pakistanis as `` asian '' . 
  it 's by no means universal . 
  but it gives the bbc a handy defence from accusations of a cover-up . 
  asian is a well-known term for a person of south indian descent !, 
  right . 
  they should just have said pakistani . 
  or better , not mentioned it at all . 
  ( you ca n't argue with that . ), 
   other crimes more prevalent in certain ethnicities are also hushed up for exactly the same reasons . 
  gun and knife crime in the black community in the uk is well known but not often discussed by a press who do n't want to be seen oppressing a downtrodden minority group . 
  or crimes like that do n't make for great news . 
   the only time i 've seen it brought up is when ukips nigel farage forced the issue in a radio debate , and was roundly condemned for `` promoting hostility '' or whatever it is . 
  these facts are a thorn in the side of those who have invested in the ideology of multiculturalism . 
  well , that 's the only thing he 's got to say , anyway , and yes , you could say he 's promoting hostility . 
  maybe he has point , but overall , he is just a demagogue . 
  while i lived in northen france , a little village , me and my brothers and mom were the only non-white . 
  everything was fine , really . 
  maybe a bit frowned upon , but never directly racist comments . 
  except for once , some guys started burning cars in the sub-urb when a cop made a mistake . 
  i got the classic `` they are commiting crimes/etc , but you , i know you .

  you dont have to think about jack . 
  i dont know you . 
  but a friggin eu diplomat changing the discussion , fuck that . 
   to be fair , / u/jack _ beauregard is n't the one who started making comparisons . 
  it was the top eu diplomat . 
  i wont bother checking his name . 
  how about we think about the victims that died in paris or beirut . 
  and less about potential threats ? 
   integration would help to reduce the existential dread are the muslims the only ones suffering from lack of integration in europe or the world ? 
  yes not all muslims commit terrorist strikes , but it 's weird when an algerian commits a terrorist strike because syria . 
  they 're not even on the same fuckin continent . 
   well , i 'm pretty sure nationalism has killed tens of millions just in the last century or so . 
  yeah but malaria has killed many many more . 
  what about malaria ? 
  what about communism ? 
  what about this and what about that ? 
  #it 's not a fucking contest . 
  i am also very confused . 
  one of the guys that committed the hostage taking came back from syria in 2014 . 
  one of the charlie hebdo terrorist went to yemen . 
  why are n't they in solitary confinement ? 
  isolated from other inmates so they dont spread hate ? 
   the 25 percent jobless rate , rising to 37 percent among the young , is significantly higher than other parts of brussels , also home to a thriving , cosmopolitan middle class drawn by the european union institutions on the other side of the city . 
  can we compare these numbers to other regions in europe ? 
  in greece the unemployment reaches 25 % . 
  that 's the whole country . 
  and [ 48 % youth unemployment ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/greece/youth-unemployment-rate ) ( holee fck btw ) . 
  should we be expecting waves after waves of greek terrorists ? / s also a quick googling can not reveal any significant amount of greeks that have joined isis . 
  disgruntled because you are poor ? 
  that i * absolutely * understand . 
  criminality because you are poor . 
  okay fine , greece has its riots , that kinda seem correlated with their level of wealth . 
  but the step : i am poor therefore i will pick up an ak 47 and go to syria and kill for allah ? 
  that 's a step that my brain refuses to understand . 
  maybe someone can explain it to me . 
   surely that means he supports terrorism . 
  / s many believe that terrorism is because of lack of integration ( i do not agree with that analysis ) . 
  but if caused by lack of integration , wouldnt more integration help ? 
   the point is that you encourage them by running around like a headless chicken . 
  so i encourage terrorism ? 
  til . 
  what 's with all those red berets floating about in hungary ? 
  are you guys not scared of those phantom berets ? 
   they knew that to november in 1961 150 bodies were fished out of the seine so up until october , 150 people are fished out of the seine . 
  this clearly means they 're the ones coming from the 17th of octobre massacre . 
  any other seine drawning would have been just a drawning before and after . 
  but in that period of time , they came from just that incident . 
   `` the battle of paris '' in 1991 tried to break through the first scientist to the collective silence the events , going from 200 , perhaps even 300 dead out . 
  reticent estimates amount to at least 50 victims . 
  so what is it finally ? 
  any sauces for those 200 people killed ? 
  wikipedia in french gives 30-57 . https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/massacre_du_17_octobre_1961, 
   so i guess you 'd prefer if he blew himself up in greece instead ? 
  so you agree the system is flawed then . 
  we 're letting in people that wan na bomb themselves . 
   by the way , the system also includes a court where you can make appeals against countries for not following signed conventions . 
  okay . 
  uhm greece : you let in a dude with a fake passport that bombed himself . 
  not cool !, 
  we 'll see you in court . 
  ooor we can leave schengen . 
  whatns better ? 
  yeah . 
  we do n't even though is they 're isis . 
   we still have laws and conventions we have to follow . 
  you mean like the dublin conventions ? 
  those are deffo followed . 
  guy signs up in greece , ends up blowing himself up in seine saint denis . 
  the system worked guys . 
   to give in to these basic reactions ** that i do not like . 
  ** actually he 's saying we 're intruding his safe space . 
  guys , lets get off his case for a second . 
  well the survivor bias is how many terrorists took otger routes than planes ? 
  the current russian flight disaster shows security measures ** are ** needed . 
  they got 225 victims . 
  that 's more that the paris one , sadly . 
   because you 're suggesting that the goal is to have tourists , consumers , restaurants and concerts rather than saving human lives uhm who 're the tourists , consumers , concert goers ? 
  are n't they people ? 
  that would be fun though , a dog cinema . 
   if this principle were applied universally it were likely that things like airport security would loose funding . 
  classical survivor bias . 
  since there are fewer plane hijacks , clearly this means that security measures were for naught and we should remove them all . 
   the idea here seems to be that resources ( and attention ) should be allocated in the way that saves the most lives . 
  then in that case , sell your car and house and give it to charities for africa . 
  that will save many more lives than now , where you are simply not using the efficiently . 
  oh , are you saying african lives do n't matter when compared to your personal comfort ? 
  that 's cynical . 
  the reality is : people die of cancer ? 
  that 's sad . 
  terrorist attack ? 
  no more friggin tourists , everything stops . 
  no more consumers , no more restaurant goers , no more concerts . 
  how do you factor those in ? 
  dont you start . 
  or i 'll take out some stats from ww1 and 2 and really show you civilian deaths . 
  not like what the us had . 
  last time i 've checked , france is n't in spain . 
   i 'm sure a cursory search in wikipedia will reveal many more . 
  it 's okay . 
  i was refering to the 1.5 million :p,

   but other than with maybe russia which is the least of these threats due to their small size and economy , geography comes to our advantage here . 
  this is weird coming from you . 
  russia has got a large nuclear arsenal . 
  you tell me you fear a confrontation between germany and france , when germany does n't even have any nuclear weapon yet , but russia is n't a big threat ? 
   china and the us are far awy and conventional power projection into europe is likely impossible . 
  there will be clashes nonetheless , because if the eu becomes one , it will be a global power and thus will compete with global resources against the us and china . 
   no , because i did not claim that france always was at war with all german states , but with some of them . 
  set theory . . then your argument does not support your point ( which is that france and germany are natural enemies ) , and it 's your only argument sadly . 
   it makes no difference in this context . 
  both were extremely bloody . 
  also 30ys war was not merely geopolitical but also religious . 
  france was a catholic state allied with protestant states . 
  so yes , on the part of france it was purely geopolitical . 
   what ? 
  of course it was possible . 
  my theory of history is not : `` those two states are immutable enemies . '', 
  it is more like : `` these two regions have fought extremely disastrous wars over the centuries for a variety of reasons , so maybe we should really loo out for political configurations that makes this unlikely because such a war with modern weapons is the last thing we need '' . 
  then maybe you should n't use the adjective natural , since it does n't mean what you think it does . 
   nope . 
  there just need to be enough sources for conflicts of interest between two populations to have them clash repeatedly over centuries , withoiut either of them thinking of some arch rivalry . 
  then they are not naturally at war as you claimed . 
  they are at war because they considered those conflict of interests big enough to justify fighting . 
   maybe you do not need it , but it certainly makes war less likely . 
  well your original point was that you needed it . 
  on that new point , we can agree . 
  still :  every bit you make war more likely , you make the long term survival of our species less likely . 
  modern germany 's industrial and scientific capabilities especially are way more destructive than at any point in history - keeping them peaceful is very important . 
  you have a very pessimistic view of the future which i do n't share . 
  but such a thing is purely subjective so i wo n't argue against it . 
   but it would be more difficult , the more freely both actors are . 
  leaving the eu is an insane proposition . 
  there is nothing insane about it ( at least given the present arguments ) since , as i explained to you , france and germany wo n't be at war just because they are n't in the same political union . 
  as such , the most meaningful way to examine this proposition is by taking other factors into account such as economic and political variables , which is what most people do . 
   that one likely does not work as well as havin pan european nationalism . 
  pan-european nationalism will not work without being * heavily * resisted , most people do not recognise themselves in an abstract european superstate . 
  it will also have the undesirable effect to put us in the same situation that france and germany had , but against russia , or china , or the usa or whatever force there is which does n't have the same interests as the eu . 
  thus , a european nationalism is no better than a french or german nationalism ( and has even more of the potential of destruction you fear ) . 
  i do n't see it . 
  i guess that since it 's a probabilistic model and not a statistical observation there is no margin of error , but you 're probably better off google translating the methodology page to understand how it 's done . 
   i explicitely remarked that france was at the time fighting against some preucrusor states of germany , not all of them . 
  i made this clear in all of my posts . 
  please go into the trouble of readinbg what i wrote . 
  yes , and it was allied with some others . 
  so your argument that france and germany were always at war loses all its basis . 
   the enlighten me which complexity i left out ? 
  there were extremely many and bloody wars between france and germany ( and its precursor states ) . 
  that is simply a correct observation . 
  between france and * some * german states . 
  you can not make the shortcut to germany as a whole . 
  also , you 're confusing wars for geopolitical interests , and nationalistic wars . 
  sometimes they can coexist ( ww1 and ww2 ) , but before the 19th century most wars only belonged to the first type . 
  out of geopolitical interests , france was for a long time an enemy of austria . 
  it did n't stop france from switching to an alliance with austria when it felt it was in its interest to do so in the 18th century . 
  if we followed your simplistic view of history , then that would not have been possible . 
   i did not say anything about natural enemies , that is your fabrications . 
  i said that naturally there was war between german states and france ( true ) i fail to see what distinction do you make between the two sentences . 
  if there is naturally war between the two countries , then surely they are natural enemies ? 
  or can you be at war without being enemies ? 
   and that closely aligning their political systems and interests might prevent it , not that it is sure to prevent it . 
  i did not claim it is impossible , just less likely , because historically there has been a lot of war between these regions . 
  the eu aligns the economic and political interests . 
  weaken these ties at your own peril . 
  and my answer is that you do n't need a political union to prevent wars between the two countries . 
  you indeed need to ensure that the geopolitical interests are aligned or at least do n't conflict , which is achieved by diplomatic and economic ties ( which you can have without the eu ) , and that nationalistic sentiments do not grow again , which is achieved by education and cultural cooperation . 
  germany did n't exist as a unified nation at the time . 
   the thirty years war on the side of france : saxony , palatinate , brunswick , brandenburg-prussia . 
   the war of austrian succession on the side of france : bavaria , prussia , saxony . 
   the seven years war on the side of france : bavaria , saxony . 
   if your view is contradicted by all of history , maybe it is wrong ? 
  maybe history is a bit more complex than you think it is . 
  now explain to me how could efforts such as those of briand and stresemann or the ecsc even be possible if france and germany are `` natural '' enemies that only the eu prevents from fighting each other off ? 
  at one point they did have to stop fighting to build the eu . 
  what changed so much that a state without the eu and without fighting is impossible ? 
  history is not natural . 
  the nationalist hatred mostly comes from the 19th century with the german unification and the war of 1870 . 
  this hatred is well over by now , even if the eu ceases to exist there will be no war between us . 
  stopping immigration wo n't stop the problems with the immigrants we already have in france . 
  we 're not going to treat a shooting as a normal thing because you want macron to win . 
  is that the sort of model you 're talking about ? 
   i 'm hoping that france has a `` business as usual '' reaction seriously ? 
  aaah right , sorry . 
  still sounds a bit tedious to me ( maybe it 's just a matter of habit , after all it 's the same with the ^ and \u00a8 for us ) but it makes more sense . 
  to be fair it has caught on here too , which is unfortunate . 
  for example hollande said he would end his presidency at fighting populism . 
  yes they 're closer to le pen but there 's still a big stigma around the fn in spite of le pen 's best efforts . 
  most of them would abstain i think , and wait for the legislative elections to turn the tide . 
  i never understood why anyone cared about that . 
  they ban who they want and we post the link to the subs we want . 
  he backtracked several times on it sadly , that did n't send a really good message . 
  the fn is a familial party . 
  there 's not a snowball 's chance in hell that le pen 's position will be contested . 
  the only one who could do that is her niece , but she 's too young to have presidential ambitions yet anyway . 
  if we 're to change keyboards there are good tailored dispositions like b\u00e9po or dvorak . 
  the french canadian one does n't look more practical than ours , it 's basically qwerty and there 's only one accent . 
  he would n't need support from parliamentary houses as he said he 'll use a referendum to trigger the call of the constituent assembly , so he just needs support from the population . 
  the 2/3 ( actually it 's 3/5 ) of the assembly + senate that / u/yannickmahe is speaking about concern the official way to revise the constitution . 
  to make the presidential election direct in 1962 , de gaulle used a single referendum by playing on the ambiguity of the constitution . 
  since that was ruled constitutional m\u00e9lenchon does n't need to go through the usual way . 
  so was lionel jospin , who was pm for 5 years . 
  mitterrand was close to the far-right in his youth .

  but ... poland can into space, 
  since when martinique , guadeloupe and french guyana are n't french anymore ? 
  france and germany  but honestly , i do n't see the point . 
  i love beer . 
  and now go to belgium and see how the guy who elevated fries to the food of gods eat them . 
   about an entire group of people . 
  which is born and mainly relevant to the us . 
  sorry mate but when it comes to the food industry they have no lesson to give . 
  the gluten free scam being the last complete joke . 
  somehow i miss the german mcd ... we tend to have a far broader offer with more originality in the sandwiches , but damn yours is cheaper and with real mayo for fries . 
  seriously what nuts in his goddamn mind pushed to remove mayo in france ? 
  i love how you are pulling figures out of your ass when i 'm linking you to a serious study . 
  the denseness of vegans is so strong , it 's utterly useless to debate with them . 
  the calorie vs energy needed for production [ does n't play in favor of a vegan diet ] ( http://www.sciencealert.com/vegetarian-and-healthy-diets-may-actually-be-worse-for-the-environment-study-finds ) . 
  so yes , it 's right . 
  at 8 $ -10 $ the big tasty , i think they are making quite good profit on their sammich as well . 
   neither ecologically nor socially . 
  neither is vegganism . 
  it 's now widely reported that the very low calorie ratio bring by a full vegan diet is catastrophic ecologically . 
  you basicaly need so much energy to produce the same quantity of calories that it transforms the gain into a liability . 
  anyway , meat for one euro does n't exist everywhere in europe and mcdonald is still subject to a shitload of norms and standards in some country obliging them to have real and acceptable quality meat . 
  edit : and the vegan downvoting brigade is kicking in !, 
  you are not building an any better image with that ... 
  neither motivating me to re-think a couple of things . 
  i 'll be happy to keep eating as much meat as it remains healthy against non-biased standard . 
  ohhhh , i see ... 
  exactly my question , and it 's what im_nice_to_everyone is suggesting . 
  please , enlight me . 
   comrpomised how come ? 
  why being right winged is incompatible with the laws of europe ? 
  well , lucky you if your country is well managed !, 
  it 's not the case for germany and their open door policy , and even our is a mess of illegal immigration . 
  some pm are trying to pass a law to automatically give away permanent residence to all prostitutes ... now we are going to have massive waves of women claiming to be a hooker to get citizenship . 
  the state of my country politics is depressing . 
  denying that our western government has n't massively change in the last 20 years is silly . 
  i 'm not saying its a bad thing overall , but you are in the denial . 
  the pc wave is far more rooted in the mind of our political and none of them will dare deport those people for the sake of their image in the eyes of a certain subset of the population . 
  i mean come on , we are so cautious with blaming refugees for any crime they commit that i ca n't fandom a deportation once their country is going to be safe . 
  on top of that , when will it be acceptable to deport those guys ? 
  when you accept as refugees people from morocco , turkey , algeria , pakistan ( read not at war and safe country ) , i do n't know when you are going to send back somalis . 
  ffs , where did you grow up ? 
  yeah right , like this is going to happen . 
  why ? 
  why is he a douche ? 
  oh god , i sort of hate you and love you right now . 
  yay that worked out so well so far ... 
  no it 's not . 
  thank you for your contribution , but freedom of speech as its limits over here , and it 's a good thing . 
  as an example , we do n't need to hear people suggesting that the holocaust did n't exist ... 
  except that a company is bringing something to the society , jobs , money , taxes , whereas the other ... 
  and what are you suggesting ? 
  more inaction ? 
   but if a belgian officer served in a joint european force under british-french command he might be equally capable after a while do n't you think ? 
  i agree , but it will take years ( if not decades ) to reach the sufficient level . 
  would people be willing to wait that long ? 
  that i doubt . 
  and i trust british and french generals because our respective armies have been actively and constantly involved in several major conflict lately . 
  this ca n't be said of many other nations in europe . 
  as a side note : german and italian also have decent capabilities , but you have to admit , not comparable involvement . 
  it might depends of your country 's consitution , but allies and ennemies is a very relative topics nowadays . 
  for instance , turkey is supposed to be our ally due to nato relations , but is greatly helping daesh lately ( by actively selling weapons and preventing defense of kurdish forces ) . 
  in that context , i would n't have a problem declaring a traitor a guy who would engage himself with the turkish army . 
   ensure the best candidate is given the position . 
  we have constant grim reminder , thanks to our politics , that it 's hardly the case . 
  and i do n't want to see that kind of behavior when it comes to sending my fellow citizen to war . 
  in the end , it wo n't come with the more competent but with the more influential , there are reasons that armies are not democracies , and it should also be the case when it comes to top command . 
  would you accept a greek general sending german troops to death only because he was appointed due to command rotation ? 
  the command rotation for the sake of `` democratie '' and/or disgusting corruption / influence is what i 'm afraid of . 
  yup , through time and if there is equal participation to the effort , which wo n't be achieved before several decades . 
  the thing is , you have no rational argument in the sense of a complete sharing of armed force in the eu . 
  believe it or not , i 'm completely for an exit of the nato force and a reborn of the eurofor . 
  now , the structure you are suggesting with a chain of command out of the competent people hands is a fallacy . 
  so what you want is a complete demilitarization of europe . 
  there is no other alternative in what you are suggesting . 
  reminiscence from the past is not making you more competent when it comes to modern war . 
  the conflict has so much change in the last 30 years that if you have n't participate in those , your experience , your training , your equipment , your doctrines are pretty much irrelevant . 
  but once again , we are dealing with human lives here , the ego of some government are irrelevant . 
  well , european nations might be a trickier issue ( as i was saying in another post ) . 
  if you have both nationality and is a european one , it might be an exception . 
  so you actually hide yourself from all conflicts during decades for the sake of your `` neutrality '' , but now you want your voice in the command chain . 
  this is ridiculous . 
  well , once they sign , they renounce to their previous nationality and identity . 
  which is pretty much in line with what i was saying . 
  no , ffs leading an army in operation is a matter of experience . 
  you can be the greatest army leader in theory but you ca n't be entitled to this kind of responsibility if you have no experience in active combat ( being officer experience or other ) . 
  i just can not accept that we are going to send people to a possible death in the hands of inexperienced people for the sake of some people ego . 
  yes , and there is a reason for that , we are dealing with an army , not regulation of banks . 
  you expect to send people to possibly die in the hand of an inexperienced command for the sake of the small nation ego ? 
  no thanks . 
  you do n't buy war experience . 
  so you actually want to give command of the european defense to a luxembourgish general ? 
  thanks but no thanks . 
  and what 's the link with the security council chair , are you asking the same from the uk ? 
  what 's the link with our nuclear arsenal ? 
  you are weirdly not asking germany or belgium to remove american weapons in their country . 
  you are not asking the brits to remove their nuclear arsenal . 
  this is a direct attack to france and is retarded in every possible sense . 
  yes , and i love the initiative , as long as we leave not experienced nation out of this kind of ideas . 
  it 's not about being fair and democratic toward other european nations , but leading people to their possible death . 
  and that can only be assumed by nations with extensive experience of fight .

  why are you so concerned about france ? 
  i 'm amazed you dont think that the us accepting 2k refugees is n't a friggin ridiculous . 
  okay this debate it done . 
  we 'll have to agree to disagree . 
  cheers, 
  i know a country that prides itself in how democratic it is , on how much they fight to protect the freedoms of its individuals . 
  during a war , they sent a part of its citizens to camps because they had the bad luck of having emigrated from the side of the enemy . 
  to the best of my knowledge , that democratic country did n't turn into a new nazi germany . 
  when the war stopped , they scaled back . 
  ( i 'm not saying lets send people to camps , btw ) . 
   however its hard to blame europe 's horrible policies relating to this on the us . 
  what should europe have done ? 
  throw some money jordan 's way and say : screw you guys , you 're on your own ? 
  close the borders ? 
  put in jail any refugee that crosses those borders ? 
  gim me some suggestions ? 
  and the 3rd reich was meant to last 1000 years . 
  but war and states of war prevented those things from happening . 
   the us did not supply them with humvees though . 
  they looted iraqi military bases when they took them over and how well trained were those iraqis ? 
  would they have looted an iraq that is under sadam ? 
   and for the record the us told the iraqi government a complete us troop withdrawal was a bad idea i 'm confused . 
  was n't it one of obama 's campaign promises in 2008 ? 
  to end the war in iraq ? 
  to bring the troops home ? 
   http://usliberals.about.com/od/homelandsecurit1/a/obamairqwr.htm, 
  yes , the countries are full . 
  how about voting for someone that wants to let some refugees come to the us too ? 
  i dont think they 'll have time to read that . 
  * sigh * i 'll be that guy . 
  this is a bill on the state of emergency . 
  much like in a state of war , a country becomes basically a police state . 
  these are n't meant to last forever , much like a state of war is n't supposed to last forever . 
   france still had private property last i checked . 
  yeah . 
  but i want my fair share of that sweet sweet lvmh moneys . 
  * grabs pitchfork *, 
   i think it is a stretch to assume syria would have remained peaceful had it not been for the iraq war . 
   http://metro.co.uk/2015/10/25/tony-blair-apologises-for-mistakes-in-iraq-and-admits-war-helped-lead-to-rise-of-isis-5460651/ well your good friend is making a wonderful stretch . 
  also see those isis fighters ? 
  quite a lot are driving humvees arent they ? 
   the us is the largest source of funds for refugees in the middle east . 
  well uhm so why are they coming to europe if they 're bathing in sweet sweet dollars ? 
  the good ol' american way . 
  throw money at the problem . 
  that surely will fix it . 
   that played a role in destabilizing the region but people acting like it was a perfect utopia before we showed up are delusional . 
  no perfect utopia , but not exactly a friggin utter shithole . 
  here 's what your dear friend tony said ; http://metro.co.uk/2015/10/25/tony-blair-apologises-for-mistakes-in-iraq-and-admits-war-helped-lead-to-rise-of-isis-5460651/  this refugee crisis did n't start in 2003 . 
  that 's because you won their hearts and minds . 
  and did you find wmds ? 
  gee willikers . 
  i felt so unsafe . 
   but this is the shit we have to deal with now , and we 're not dealing with it the way we should . 
  because germany and sweden went full on : `` omg we can solve this problem on our own . 
  let them come '' there should have been a clear response from the eu to the us and everybody that could help . 
  last time i 've checked france didnt start the war in iraq that has in part resulted in this turd . 
  if everybody would pitch in : i 'm looking at you us and uk , yeah . 
  did i blame you ? 
  im pointing the finger at the us . 
  they started the friggin iraqi war that destabilized the whole region . 
  you probably should n't have invaded iraq, 
  okay . 
  so any syrian refugee that lands on us soil will be taken in ? 
  i 'm sure we can scrape a ship or two . 
   every leader wanted to keep leadership , so he veered away from unification . 
   except some failed experiments and that failed experiment is an example of arab leader trying to extend his reign in other regions and i kiiinda doubt moroccans are so willing to unite . 
  considering that the border between them and algeria has been closed for 21 years . 
  talk aboit brotherly love . 
  arabic countries have sufficient differences between them to make any sort of union unfeasable . 
  but i guess it 's easier to blame the west and israel than try to improve . 
  a sobering statistic that shows the state of the arab world :  your country should recognize the state of israel yes : palestine ( 13 % ) , egypt , sudan , lebanon ( 8 % ) no : algeria ( 1 % ) , iraq , libya , saudi ( 4 % ), 
  countries should share the refugee load , do n't you think ? 
  or we can let the refugee situation worsen in europe until it blows over in a decade or so ... whatevs ... 
  and to think the us accepted a grand total of 2000 syrian refugees . 
  so i should n't trust drugged up mad lithuanians with my valuables ? 
  what 's this world coming to ? 
  well if a drugged up mad man running around with an ak-47 does n't male you feel safe , nothing will . 
   ... that the finish region \u00c5land had the highest employment rate for men in the eu in 2014 ( 89.3 % of the male population were employed ) , while the italian region calabria had the lowest ( 54.2 % ) ? 
  if this wont make those calabrese men feel special on this fine day , nothing will . 
  cock magic ? 
   the ak was in the police car is it standard procedure to leave ak-47 in cars ? 
  how did he steal the ak-47 ? 
  okay . 
  no harm no foul . 
  well lets just say quebecan is not french . 
  [ jk , i love fred pellerin !, 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sft1_uns9co ), 
  and we can also talk about the ridiculous salaries doctors in romania are receiving . 
  they 're basically paid through bribes . 
  i 'm sure if france decided : screw this , we 'll stop paying our docs good salaries , our budget would see a huge decrease . 
   but please correct me if i am wrong . 
  you seem to be very knowledgeable on the subject . 
  well lets see what the interwebs say :  http://www.antena3.ro/actualitate/sectia-arsi-spital-iasi-semnal-alarma-322127.html rough translation :  the burn center at saint spiridon is a joke says the former dean of the medicine university iasi . 
  and an interesting quote :  these units have to send to bucharest any patient that has burns that exceed 20 % of the surface of the body if france were to decide : screw it , no more spending on anything , im sure we could post a very nice budget too . 
   you seem to have a clear focus on moldova and i also get the feeling you have been following romanian news / social media too closely . 
  and it 's part of romania is n't it ? 
  to come back , for example , boston bomber , well there 's no doubt he got what he was looking for . 
   neither is this one . 
  i agree with you .

  blame sarkozy for that . 
  every human right activist was shouting that it was a bad idea to do business with dictators and that putin was not a good guy , but he still made the deal . 
  hollande would love to have a way to not fulfill the contract , so this is why they are trying to get nato to buy the ships instead . 
  here we go !, 
  on schedule for the final game of the world cup . 
  now grab all you can before the half-time !, 
  except the article says they do n't speak english . 
   that companies look into removal requests , and that denied requests can be heard by a civil authority for reconsideration . 
  so , basically , it asks for the company to make a case for its refusal to remove content . 
  how exactly google is supposed to meet the millions it will receive ? 
  either it can say `` request denied automatically because we do n't have time to look into all of these . '', 
  without facing any trouble , and this cjeu ruling does not change a single thing and is therefore useless . 
  or it need to really to some processing in which case it will probably choose the safest and cheapest option to automatically accept and let the original publisher make their own case to appeal this decision : this is the dmca situation . 
  so tell me , which is it ? 
  the right to be forgotten has been around for a while , and people who defend it are not your usual privacy right activist . 
  the cjeu is not the one writing the law . 
  ok , time to translate a part of a note i wrote in french in 2011 after an open data meeting . 
  ( [ original ] ( http://piepaille.blogspot.jp/2011/12/donnees-publiques-et-publiees-droit.html ) )  ** the right to be forgotten is inapplicable **  the right to be forgotten is more and more debated nowadays [ was written in 2011 ] . 
  this is a good idea , which is unfortunately not technically implementable . 
  one must have the courage to abandon it before too much damage is made in its name . 
   in the same way that you ca n't force someone to forget a fact , you ca n't erase an information from internet . 
  internet is made of the hundreds of millions of computers of its users , and each has the possibility to save anything it wants . 
  asking that data be erased in the name of the right to be forgotten is similar to ask the police come within your home to burn newspaper older than a given date . 
  it is technically impossible to implement this right realistically without opening the door to frightening abuses . 
   anyway , there is no reason to be alarmed : the moral right to be forgotten is already well understood , accepted and applied by most of the population . 
  teenage mistakes are generally well pardoned by society . 
  it is of bad taste for a journalist to find back old faults , however it is considered a fair game in front of public figures who do exactly that . 
  so really , after they tried it with terrorism , pedophilia , copyright infringement , the right to be forgotten is the new trojan horse used to disguise internet monitoring and censorship as an honourable endeavour . 
  dont ' t buy into it . 
   as for the media myth created to make populations of northern countries feel righteous and supportive for the austerity/colonization experiment in greece , that of bad , lazy , cheating people being rightfully punished by the saintly , just eu ... sorry i ca n't go there again . 
  i 'd like to avoid a stroke . 
  do n't worry , those of us who can think correctly know that when such a high proportion of people evade taxes , there is something fucked up in the system itself , not just within the population . 
  possibly . 
  i find that the weirdest thing ever is [ mussolini 's headquarters ] ( http://i1.wp.com/www.retronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/mussolini.jpg?resize=680%2c467 ) ( si means yes ) i mean , it totally lacks subtlety . 
  exactly : for them , it being illegal was the last of their worries . 
  you always can . 
  a thing being illegal does not make it impossible . 
  during the world cup , international opinion is focused on football . 
  no one cares about ongoing wars or laws being passed . 
  and i swear , this is one of the busiest time for legislators . 
  i would say yes . 
  i tend to use fascism and authoritarianism or police state interchangeably but some people , especially historian , insist that fascism only applies to mussolini 's government and has a lot of characteristics that most authoritarians nowadays do not meet . 
  in theory , to call someone a fascist is as often inaccurate as calling someone a nazi . 
  i 'll continue however to call a fascist someone who promotes a personified power and wants to destroy the separation of powers . 
  i 'll acknowledge that it is actually a metonymy if some definition-nazi asks me . 
  i do n't know where you are from , but i have encountered an interesting theory on the influence of the ussr collapse on the french ( and presumably western ) right-left axis in politics . 
  it said that as long as ussr existed , and financed far-left groups across the world , right-wing capitalism tried to be more or less associated with democratic principles , and tried to undermine far-left support by indulging in far more social welfare measures than they would naturally do . 
  since 1991 , however , every welfare program is seen as a leftist thing . 
  fighting the inequalities ( which used to be a right-wing value !, 
  ) , fighting monopolies are not considered right-wing values anymore . 
  they do n't have to fight a push or a pull from a worldwide villain anymore . 
  can putin 's russia have a similar role ? 
  if so , it wo n't be as a communist state . 
  we can debate over that , but most of putin 's values echo far-right values . 
  religion , anti-foreigners , anti-gays , pan-nationalism , enforced morality ... 
  so how would it work ? 
  would it exert a push or a pull pressure ? 
  will right-wing parties benefit or suffer from a proximity to russia 's strong man 's ideas ? 
  i have no idea . 
  i do think however that russia is drawing a new moral landscape in europe and sitting at one end of the spectrum . 
  i would love for it to make the old right/left axis obsolete . 
  well , a lot of things make a war materially very hard . 
  erasmus and other things work toward making them totally undesired . 
  in the words of a famous french humorist : `` we are totally fucked up , look at our youngsters : beatniks . 
  they do n't want to make war . 
  i heard that even the young germans do n't want to make war . 
  gives you an idea of the mess we are in ... '', 
  if russia was an ally to us an a candidate for eu , putin would have a hard time explain why he needs absolute power . 
  having powerful ( but not too aggressive please ) enemies is an absolute necessity for a dictator . 
  student parties are the crucible in which you forge the solidarity between nations so that one day we may have a single people in europe instead of a patchwork of national interests . 
  read what is in the russian laws . 
  it is worst acta and sopa together . 
  this is their worst case scenario x 1000 . 
  the world cup is a gift from heaven for political leaders with an agenda . 
  burn gaza , turn russia into a real dictatorship , people wo n't get into outrage before the final . 
  if you replace `` fascist '' ( which no two people use in the same meaning ) with `` authoritarian '' , this has pretty much been the case since 1945 . 
  or 1975 , depending on how you view franco and the greek dictatorship . 
  while you can . 
  mother russia will be assuming stewardship of reddit from now . 
  please continue your activities without any worry . 
  do n't mind the corpses . 
  i was happy that putin reminded us what a real and self-confident liar really looked like , i am doubly happy that he also reminds how quickly you can curb down dissent when you have enough bigoted support . 
  switzerland , you are not even trying ... 
  this project is actually older than the eu . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/military_of_the_european_union and indeed , usa stated repeatedly and publicly that they do not want it because they fear it would weaken nato . 
  now i am picturing you as poland here : http://satwcomic.com/how-to-keep-friends, 
  agreed about science and humanities : scientists make great `` social sciences '' researchers . 
  about languages . 
  german is only relevant in a small chunk of the world , which does happen to be economically dynamic , but it is very small . 
  french is spoken in a lot of african countries , spanish in most latin-america country . 
  so it really depends on where op plans to spend his time in the future . 
  been there . 
  done that . 
  confirmed to work fine . 
  my added advice : go for automation and industrial processes . 
  this is not clear at all . 
  the rate at which france borrows money now is at an historic low ( lowest rate since 1940 ) k. rogoff is a well-known debt eschatologist who actually became famous twice . 
  first , when he got quoted by a lot of people desperate to have a strong empirical proof of the evils of public deficit , and second , when it was proven that his most famous paper that was the basis of so much policies was actually full of mistakes that totally changed the result . 
  no one should take him too seriously . 
  if your goal is to protect against russia , you do n't even need the whole europe .

clearly , a lot of people care , at least enough to post about it on reddit . 
  i 've just been ignoring those posts . 
  :p works well for me . 
  with the extended interview [ here ] ( http://sicnoticias.sapo.pt/pais/2016-08-23-a-versao-dos-filhos-do-embaixador-do-iraque ) . 
  everything , from the story to the apology , is way too smooth and detached to reflect any kind of `` remorse . '', 
  they are victims of society , really ? 
  is anyone intelligent really going to believe this kind of thing is commonplace in portugal ? 
  do they even realize what state they left the kid in ? 
  even if things happened * exactly * as they describe ( ha ) , you only have to look at their perfectly healthy state and then read an article about how ruben ended up * in a medically-induced coma needing surgery * to know something 's up . 
  see no reason to swap , really . 
  if i had to , though , probably sweden or germany . 
  it was a great match . 
  [ here ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/prevalence_of_tobacco_consumption#oecd_2015_rankings ) you go . 
  apparently could n't decide between mandarin and spanish . 
  the same number of people voted for each . 
  the attacks have revived something of a patriotic flame i did n't even know existed . 
  it 's not that i ca n't see our flaws , or that i think it 's the best place on earth . 
  i do n't even want to spend the rest of my life in france , but i consider myself so lucky to have been born there and , if it came down to it ... 
  i mean , i do believe france is * worth * fighting for . 
  i do n't know what i was expecting , but 29 % does n't seem too bad , especially given how vague the question is . 
  there 's nothing we can do either , and it does suck . 
  thank you . 
  thanks for the laugh . 
  i am genuinely scared of the fn , though . 
  as much as i never want this to be a reality ... that 's * good * . 
   europe will finally be able to actually do what it needs to , and not be held hostage by bully uk . 
  no more exceptions , no more rebates , no more opt-outs . 
  this is what i 've been telling myself to make myself believe i do n't care that much . 
  so far it 's working okay . 
  if le pen ( who is probably the strongest supporter of a `` frexit '' ) passed , we would have bigger problems than worrying about a frexit . 
  i do n't even want to contemplate it . 
  please no . 
   a ) pretending not to understand them how does that go then ? 
  `` i 'm sorry , i do n't understand what you 're saying . 
  do you speak english ? '', 
  that does n't sound like a smart strategy . 
  i 'd vote blank if i wanted a `` prostest vote . '', 
  our first round has traditionally been the `` vote de conviction , '' it seems weird to vote for someone in the first round while * intending * to vote against them in the second round . 
  i 'd really say most le pen first round voters would also vote for her in the second round . 
  hopefully they 're ( almost ) the only ones . 
  i was disappointed . 
  this could totally count as clickbait . 
  yeah , pretty much . 
  i do n't think he 'd be my president of choice ( i 'm waiting to see his program ) , but if it 's a choice between him and fillon or le pen , you can bet my vote will be going to him . 
  what program ? 
  ah , so basically you really hope fillon and le pen will lose . 
  yeah , me too ... 
  can i ask why ? 
  and he was a minister under hollande and valls -- minister * of the economy * , no less . 
  then he quit and said he wanted to be president . 
  i 'm not sure what people are expecting of him given he has n't given us a program yet , so maybe they 're just hopeful or something . 
  same whenever i drive through the czech republic . 
  we play count the skoda octavias on the parking lots . 
  a lot of people here would probably also rather vote for a centrist than a far right politician . 
  unfortunately , fillon is far from being a centrist in france . 
  he 's to the right of the usual right . 
  i 've always said i would never ever vote fn , but i can understand why people , if faced with that choice , would vote le pen . 
  i had n't seen this yet . 
  * thank you . 
  where 's the problem ? 
  we improved it . 
  merci !, 
  do they tell french people learning french ? 
  i do n't remember learning this . 
  i never put a space ... : /, 
  i would n't , but it 's a pretty common opinion . 
  do n't lie to him !, 
  here i sit , still waiting for ze ordnung to flow through me . 
  i do n't get it , everyone arounds me see him as someone who offers nothing but * predictability * . 
  i think i 'll take merkel over this idiot . 
  agreed ... 
  i have a hard time grasping the strategy here tbh . 
  source please . 
  do point me to napoleon talking about the alliance fran\u00e7aise of shanghai ( established in the '90s ) and france being the top tourist destination worldwide , sounds interesting . 
  the people i know who voted for him think his choice is consistent with the ideas he defended during the campaign . 
  and they do n't feel they need to be told whom to vote for . 
  it 's everyone else who is getting pissed off at m\u00e9lenchon 's silence . 
  thirded , lived there 4 years . 
  the city center is beautiful . 
  they exist . 
  the flavored ones are fine , pineapple especially . 
  `` natural '' ( no other fruit flavor , but sweetened as fuck ) is meh . 
  i tried out of curiosity , but i would n't make it my morning drink . 
  there are some in asian food stores and organic food stores . 
  i would not call them popular . 
  about 2,400 if my expenses stayed the same . 
  but they probably would n't . 
  when i 'm in the city where i go to uni , every day . 
  in an ideal world it would be my preference but in real life it has n't played out that way . 
  i settled for having sex with people i knew well and trusted ( and who were n't extremely promiscuous ) . 
  i did get tested back in september , which was easy and great for peace of mind , and my boyfriend showed me his test results from just after his last relationship . 
  but by then we 'd been having sex for a couple months . 
   what 's your rationale ? 
  i was in love . 
  ration-what ? 
   is there a stigma against testing in your country ? 
  i do n't know about * stigma * but sometimes i 'm a bit baffled by the attitude towards it . 
  my ex-girlfriend seemed to think she was immune since she was a lesbian . 
  i once brought up testing ( just herself , not even her partner ! ), 
  with a friend who 's had more sexual partners than me and she said * why * ?

  capitalism 's a bitch ai n't it ? 
  you obviously never been to rock en seine to see how the public is . 
   what ? 
  festival goers are narrow minded bigots ? 
  so not wanting an idiot to perform because he made dumbass remarks that insult a ton of people is `` bigotism '' . 
  i do n't think you know what that word means . 
  also can you repeat after me ** our money , our choice ** . 
  now we 're at the stage where we pretend that nothing will happen and everything will be ok is uk leaves . 
  canada gets it . 
  maybe he realised the ship has sailed and he is doing damage control . 
  they ought to cut him some slack . 
  this is just pathetic . 
  i really doubt the french public that goes to these types of concerts would agree with his views . 
  since more french died ... sorry no slack . 
  people that go to rock en seine tend to be more forward thinking . 
  i know crazy ... 
   say homosexuals need to have their dicks cut off and nobody bats an eye . 
  that 's ** bullshit ** . 
  a rapper black m was called to make a performance at the verdun centenary . 
  but because of his shitarted comments against gay and kuffars he was let go . 
  now he 's playing the racism card . 
  just like you play this card . 
  suez crasis was small fries compared to half of europe . 
  when france uk and israel started messing up the region the quickly got told what to do . 
  you think uk did something so massive without us knowing ? 
   i 've had quite bad experience pretty much anytime i had to talk with british physicians . 
  do they call you trash and stuff like that ? 
  or do they seem superior . 
  because those things are similar . 
  not even by a long shot . 
  ah yes . 
  much important , great value . 
  the guy never even visited hungary . 
  why do they both ( and especially her ) have a face that says `` this is my life now '' . 
   london might as well be a different country nonsense . 
  i 've been to london and i must say i love uk . 
  yeah but still 16 is high man for a lot of europe . 
  / r/nambla / s please do n't put me on a list guys . 
   what a devastating news to see a young person like dagmara gone , prematurely and undeservedly darn , i 'm about to make you [ depressed ] ( http://etudiant.lefigaro.fr/les-news/actu/detail/article/polytechnique-deux-eleves-se-donnent-la-mort-a-a-quelques-jours-d-intervalle-19451/ ) but [ it happens ] ( http://www.franceinfo.fr/actu/societe/article/en-roumanie-le-malaise-des-etudiants-francais-en-medecine-683941 ) all the friggin [ time ] ( http://www.dna.fr/actualite/2016/03/09/suicide-d-un-eleve-de-l-ecole-militaire-de-saint-cyr-coetquidan-l-enquete-requalifiee-en-provocation-au-suicide ) . 
   in our society , boys are supposed to prepare for this sad truth . 
  men should n't cry . 
  or do n't be a minger . 
  [ source : ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4k7s0g/polish_girl_who_complained_of_classroom_racism/d3czmif ), 
   it 's like a nice face is an even better marketing ploy than a dead child face-down in the sand . 
  we should have a subreddit that matches attractiveness to the sort of gruesome death needed to achieve national paper appearance . 
  mine would be `` lone engineer only casualty of the failed first launch of ariane 6 . 
  the failure was caused by another coding error ... produced by the same engineer '' . 
  i do n't work even work as an engineer not at arianespace but i write shitty code . 
  i 'm sure a death like that would get my face plastered on one or two papers . 
   without the help of the united states during the cold war , poland and hungary would not be free . 
  kindly forgetting [ why they were under communist rule from the get go ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/percentages_agreement ) and it 's obvious us opposed the ussr because they wanted to free hungary and poland . 
  that what the cold war was all about . 
  they are enabling such a system . 
  and most definitely they are financing the nk regime with fresh foreign money . 
   because it 's not stopping people to kill , rape or steal things ... 
  here 's the thing . 
  they sometimes do catch those people . 
   but for exemple , it make it easier to prosecute people who are making racist comment on internet . 
  yeah it will totally stop / u/niqtamer from being a racist asshole on reddit and youtube . 
  a law that bans racism ? 
  why did n't we try that before ... 
   all you need to do is drag a child from the street into a van , and they disappear forever . 
  taken was n't a documentary , you know . 
  the majority of cases do n't happen like that . 
  it 's like / u/caffeinatedt said . 
  it 's mostly poor/destitute families on the fringe of society that sell their kids . 
  there is n't some mega wide european child stealing ring . 
   with the prevalence of destitute foreigners parading through anatolia and the mediterranean and no browns are stealing kids . 
  they 're more likely to sell theirs probably . 
  but hey : fear amirite ? 
  wtf poland ? 
   i know this a political event and not a football match i know you 're sarcastic , but they do n't have much going for them man . 
   i wonder why french government is so in a hurry to fight internet racism omg . 
  yeah man . 
  a twitter hashtag and a ridiculous campaign will fight racism . 
  get real dude, 
  i am simply stating that internet comments are hardly relevant . 
  it 's like reading youtube comments to find out how a society is ( `` if they write that , they must be thinking it deep down '' ), 
  isolationism . 
  i mean lets go the whole way man . 
   i 'm sure the greeks and frenchs are feeling very smart right now , with the left and ultra-left party you have ** no idea ** what you 're talking about . 
  so poland wants to leave the eu ? 
  darn not bad . 
  yeah they do it on versailles . 
   `` babtou fragile '' yeah cuz we never see people being called bougnoule . 
   oh and most of the graffiti is done by the same group . 
  not graffiti . 
  yeah . 
  im sure braun had plans for space walking ... 
  a few regions in romania remain unspoilt ( which is pretty amazing considering 50 years of communism ) . 
  i fail to understand why having droves of tourists messing everything up is a desirable thing . 
  those tourists will be interested in nature etc since urban tourism is shit in romania . 
  so why invade the few regions that are actually awesome like the danube delta . 
  because having droves of tourists fucking up the landscape and throwing snicker wrappers at pelicans in the danube is a desirable thing . 
  you people also say belgium is a real country . / s, 
  vlc just cuz one of my alma maters . 
  not a jet though . 
  things are wrong . 
  but europe and france has been through worse . 
  i know it 's weird .

  of course then there is all that shit in africa too . 
  but likely genghis khan if you talk in raw numbers . 
  the guy killed like 15 % of the planet 's population . 
  of course , that 's only counting recent recorded history . 
   when you realize that not only are there people stupid enough to think that the fn is the same as the nazi party but that their people as stupid as you in sufficient numbers to actually tilt the vote , it becomes clear why europe is in such a deep crisis . 
  what do you call a party with national as the name and that makes joke about gaz chamber and quietly want to deport millions of second gen immigrants because-they-are-not-from-french-stock-enough ? 
   similarly , it 's staggering that you can equate restricting immigration with ethnic cleansing . 
  how is destroying roma encampments `` restricting immigration '' ? 
  how is talking about making list of `` non french to deport '' equivalent to `` restricting immigration '' ? 
  how are curfew bullshit or `` we 'll clean the banlieux with karshers '' equal to `` restricting immigration '' ? 
   i ca n't believe anyone who can write such things has managed to survive thus far with helping hit by a bus . 
  well you do appear to be alive soo the question do stand ...  or the european people to continent become almost entirely islamicized by 2100 just replace `` islam '' by `` the jews '' and reread your last ten arguments for a minute . 
  please , do so . 
   which path would present a brighter prospect for humanities future for science and technology and human rights and discovery ? 
  well , at my own level i 'm currently watching daesh get blasted in the middle east instead of watching my space-related pet programs so i do n't think you are in any place to lecture me on the topic . 
   it 's the demographics , stupid and what do you call deporting millions of people ? 
  oh yeah , ethnic cleansing . 
  but i guess `` demographics '' sounds more clean in your head . 
   considering the long and profoundly violent history of islam , as opposed to the long and violent history of national socialists who want to put millions of people in cargo boats . 
   you should be checked into a mental institution . 
  well i 'm not the one wanting to vote in power the daughter of jean marie `` let 's drop ebola canisters in africa '' lepen . 
  as long as the prices remains reasonable that makes sense ( since people who do n't live here do n't contribute to the social system ), 
  you think now is worse than what will happen if the nazi party gets elected to the presidential and start pushing their little ethnic cleansing projects ? 
  ho boy , you truly lack imagination . 
  they 're already busy trying to make the romas homeless around here . 
  lol . 
  i 'd even almost say `` okay , but the money goes to the state coffers period . '', 
  ( ukraine 's flat broke and desperate :\\ \\ ) . 
  if they were trying to get it for personnal wealth , i hope they 'll get arrested for fraud . 
   edit : why am i not surprized to see thyanybok 's involved in this, 
  sorry , my french slipped in i guess haha , fixed it, 
  could be that we have dark days ahead : /, 
  islamic kindergartens ? 
  what the hell ? 
  do we have to tolerate indoctrination starting from the crib ? 
   `` many parents want to create a one hundred percent islamic environment for their children , '' said aslan . 
  and this is exactly what we should firmly , strictly refuse in europe . 
  they can already go to the middle east/north africa regions if they want it . 
   there are 150 islamic kindergartens in vienna , most of which receive state funding . 
  `` i am convinced that we should close many of these facilities right away , '' said kurz . 
  100 % agreed . 
  no special exceptions , schools or pass , sorry . 
  go to the same schools as everyone else . 
   curriculum : there were significant differences between the official curriculum , which was used as a basis for requesting funding , and what was actually being taught , which was barely different from what can be found in madrassas in predominantly muslim countries such as pakistan and afghanistan . 
  unacceptable . 
  any establishment trying to pretend legally to the statut of school needs to use the legally backed state curriculum . 
  just like we do n't tolerate fake hospitals ; there should be no tolerence for fake schools . 
   so what is to be done ? 
  we should tell them `` respect and teach the state curriculum or face being closed down . '', 
   if isil wants to detonate a chemical or dirty weapon in brussels , there is nothing in place to stop them . 
  obviously there was . 
  remember last lockdown ? 
   suspend immigration for a year that would n't stop them from trying to cross illegally . 
  that would only stop refugees fleeing them . 
   bomb isil into rubble already ongoing  put boots on the ground and annex the region . 
  ahah you are out of your mind . 
  discounting the fact that we can not afford to occupy another country right now , or even 3 of them ( syria/iraq/afghanistan ) , let alone one in the middle east where everyone bar a few already hates us to the bones , that would only make the problem 10x worse . 
  bush tried that one , that gave us isis to deal with . 
   but it would solve the problem , and bismarck would approve . 
  http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01112/mission_accomplish_1112950c.jpg oh wait , it actually solved nothing and led us to today . 
  ps : for the records our troops already occupy part of mali , car , and other places , since years , and those are still hellholes . 
  if this is an accusation of supporting the fn police state , i 'm not exactly the local nazis ' biggest fan around but ... 
  trying to prevent the 4th round of paris attacks of the year would be nice tho . 
  if possible without a police state or people with swatiskas in power in france . 
  perfect . 
  how about starting by seizing the 100m and putting them in the states coffer . 
  it 's probably the most important bit . 
   sorry , look , that 's about a truck full of explosives , not cbrn since they did n't used a truck , i will assume you do not know the nature of the incident and will ignore that . 
   maybe isil will do things not it 's not a `` maybe '' and `` will '' . 
  it 's `` they were caught red handed again 3 weeks ago doing it in hannover '' : http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/germany-terror-alert-hannover-lockdown-6850456  you 've put forward for cbrn terror capability does n't actually relate to it . 
  probably because i do n't want to write a terrorist manual on the internet ? 
   the likelihood of such things is very very low are you really telling me that after 3 major attacks in paris in the span of a year and an entire nbc smuggling network recently dismantled ? 
  are you out of your damn mind ? 
   certainly way too low to justify public fear . 
  public fear ? 
  on the contrary , it would be better if they ignore the whole thing to avoid spreading panic . 
  but that does n't mean the state should n't do things like handing over scanners to the cops , putting rads sensors in airports & key migrant pass or pass any post office package in the scanner at some point . 
   media and security experts focus on the most alarming and sophisticated imaginable scenarios . 
  fuck the media , i 'm speaking about dealing with the current threats we are already dealing . 
   time after time , terrorist groups demonstrate that the key to success in asymetric warfare is kiss - keep it simple . 
  well obviously you have n't paid any attention . 
  here there are pictures of them chain manufacturing dictionary-format ied : https://www.reddit.com/r/syriancivilwar/comments/3c34it/isis_manufacturing_their_laptop_slim_ieds/ ? 
  and another factory like this one was recently dismantled in al hawl after the coalition took it like two week ago . 
  but go ahead , after watching the sdf taking days to demine the whole place , and just as much in sinjar , please tell me how daesh would n't try to smuggle something like that here and that 's `` impossible '' and that i 'm just `` fear mongering '' . 
  `` but they would never make it to europe ! '', 
  oh you mean like the ones in hannover ? 
   personally , i 'd prefer to worry about what 's known to be possible and repeatedly shown to work , and work well , for terrorist groups . 
  which is exactly what i 'm talking about right now . 
   the group appears to have manufactured rudimentary chemical-warfare shells , and used them to attack kurdish positions in iraq and syria at least three times in june and july 2015.2 according to investigators , this involved toxic industrial or agricultural chemicals repurposed as weapons . 
  and stockpiles they seized from assad 's chemical installations . 
  which are actually dangerous enough we had to deal with the russians to get those seized , in case you forget . 
   that is `` appears to have '' , `` claimed '' , and `` reported suspected '' . 
  your gross dismissal of the risk is pretty dangerous . 
  nobody 's saying we have to flatten yet another country like bush did . 
  but saying `` nothing will happen '' is ridiculous and tempting fate . 
   again , gas artillery shells are gas artillery shells - stop lying , they used other mean of attack during various battles around rojava , multiple ypg fighters got burned by that shit and by that point they did n't had any artillery left ( because it was all blown up on sight from above ) . 
   not something there 's any point in smuggling into paris again , * you do n't know that * . 
  i do n't know about numbers , but the main problem is morrocans and ksa radical imams who are sent by their elite to preach in france . 
   plus , free movement and all that . 
  maybe having an eu passport ?

  i dont understand anything of the characters you use there :(, 
  it 's a bit sad for the countries who make fun of one of their neighbors but dont get the attention back . 
  i do n't think he is disagreeing with you . 
  the `` pretty '' in pretty brutal does not mean that it is literally pretty , it is a qualifier to acknowledge that it is indeed brutal . 
  there are actually a number of those restrictions already in place or in deployment ( right to modification , to be forbidden , to portability , to information etc. . . ) . 
  also , personal data already can not leave the eu unless some legal tools are used . 
  it is personal data only when you can link it to an individual 's identity . 
  the directive/gdpr only apply to personal data . 
  so you admit that it is just about not being associated with other eastern europeans/russians . 
  how ironic when a third of the estonian population is russian and russia is both more to the north and east or estonia . 
  estonia may very well be a country that happens to be more north than most , but its primary characteristic is that it is eastern european . 
  and there is nothing wrong with that . 
  central europe would be around germany . 
  finland is northern europe . 
  i do n't understand what is so complicated , just ask anyone who does n't leave in eastern europe and they will tell you that . 
  it is very clear that estonia is eastern europe , why do you hate your fellow eastern europeans so much that you are trying to distance yourself ... 
  no , it is because eastern europe starts east of germany , 
  to be fair though , americans are the true inventors of pizza . 
  you missed an opportunity to use the word pleonasm and sound smart . 
  i know a great deal about the countries east of me , and this is my informed decision . 
  for instance , germany and austria are not eastern europe . 
  how about the demographic center ? 
  really not attached to it being in france by the way . 
  i said this in jest , the center of europe is is more germany in my opinion . 
  i 'd say i 'm pretty knowledgeable on the topic . 
  it is literally my job to explain how europe works to people . 
  to be fair , noone calls anything central europe except eastern europeans who dont want to be called eastern european . 
  it surely is about culture and estonia fits in the eastern europe box . 
  because it is more to the north . 
  got ta draw the limit somewhere . 
  [ these bears ] ( http://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bearmarket.asp ), 
  what do you mean an empty claim ? 
  you are definitively in the east of europe . 
  you border russia and are even further east than poland ... 
  there is no way you can seriously think you are not part of eastern europe ... 
  europe 's center is the franco-german border though . 
  they are . 
  estonia is definitively and eastern european country though . 
  that is incorrect . 
  they repaid 25.7 mn euros , the money was recovered in july 2016 by the netherlands ( it was published in the regulatory press ) . 
  they did however appeal . 
  it 's actually quite impressive how successful those natalist policies were . 
  is it only abortion policies who had that effect or were there other policies involved ? 
  you 're actually quite wrong , he is very experienced in eu affairs . 
  in addition to being in the foreign office , agriculture ministry ( + a couple more ) in france , he was commissioner for ten years ( 5 years as the internal market and services commissioners , one of the most important posts , and 5 years on regional policy ) , would have been the commission president if juncker had not won , is currently an advisor focusing on foreign policy and security . 
  he is very much an experienced politician . 
  at eu level he was in charge of re-regulating the financial sector and is actually quite knowledgeable of this ( more than the uk side who technically has not appointed a financial expert yet ) . 
  he is hated by the city for that . 
  additionally , he is a convinced europhile . 
  so , back to your point , it is quite the opposite , the uk side really has to get its shit together , because barnier has much more experience at this than them and has the connections to get things done . 
  this was quite a smart/powerful move from juncker , and you can see that from the reaction of the uk govt who stressed in its reaction statement that they looked forward to work with the council , member states and the commission , implying that he was just one guy amonst others ( ie . 
  they would rather not deal with him ) . 
  well , i disagree with you . 
  it is extremely likely that the commission will be leading the negociations , even staff in the council and permreps are convinced . 
  for now he is indeed in charge of his taskforce to prepare the work , but juncker by appointing such an experienced politician ( as opposed as a civil servant like seuws ) is sending a strong message . 
  there is no reason for him not to be the formal negociator once the process is formally triggered . 
  well , he is not technically the eu negotiator , he is the chief of the coordination taskforce with the commission . 
  it is a bit more long winded , article 218 specifies that the commission submits recommendations and the council actually adopts the decision nominating the negotiator . 
  that being said there never was any doubts that it would be the commission doing the actual negotiations while the council will draft a mandate , as / u/jtalin says . 
  seuws , the head of the brexit taskforce in the council only has a 4 man team , there is no way he could or will do the actual negotiating with the uk . 
  fyi : the relevant texts are below . 
  article 50 teu 2 / a member state which decides to withdraw shall notify the european council of its intention . 
  in the light of the guidelines provided by the european council , the union shall negotiate and conclude an agreement with that state , setting out the arrangements for its withdrawal , taking account of the framework for its future relationship with the union . 
  that agreement shall be negotiated in accordance with article 218 ( 3 ) of the treaty on the functioning of the european union . 
  it shall be concluded on behalf of the union by the council , acting by a qualified majority , after obtaining the consent of the european parliament . 
  article 218 tfeu 3 / the commission , or the high representative of the union for foreign affairs and security policy where the agreement envisaged relates exclusively or principally to the common foreign and security policy , shall submit recommendations to the council , which shall adopt a decision authorising the opening of negotiations and , depending on the subject of the agreement envisaged , nominating the union negotiator or the head of the union 's negotiating team . 
  about fucking time . 
  it won ' be that , as you said it would be a logistical nightmare . 
  i heard belgium would take it over . 
  i heard belgium was taking it . 
  so much is wrong in this video = /, 
  you 're also the country that takes the most anti depressants . 
  ca n't you just be happy for them then ? 
  never said anything about investing in france , they can go to frankfurt , milan or amsterdam for all i care . 
  brilliant , ca n't wait . 
  why would he not ? 
  i do n't understand what you 're trying to say . 
  what the parent said is true , member states are the ones who do the negotiation , who ratify and who have the final say in all eu legislation . 
  cameron just did his little show and annoyed everybody else with his petty problems like they were the most important thing in the world . 
  there wo n't be treaty changes , not because the commission is blocking anything , but because you ll never have unanimity to agree to the uk 's bullshit . 
  no , cameron got noting . 
  that sounds awesome . 
  # 3 please !, 
  real pizza is american though . 
  bravo, 
   netherlands could beat us overnight in quitting nuclear power quitting nuclear is losing , not beating . 
  of course , i meant in eu circles . 
  dutch is just not a language used despite the fact that we 're in brussels ( as opposed to french ) . 
  of course some people speak dutch here , just not that common . 
  i work in the eu bubble , can assure you virtually noone speaks dutch . 
  ( i think someone spoke dutch to me only once or twice in a few years ) . 
  french is almost mandatory though . 
   sorry , but `` studied/work in eu affairs '' argument is just laughable . 
  never used this as an argument , just why i do n't plan on reading the wikipedia page . 
   i 've linked only two single-page wikipedia articles . 
  the third one shows you were completely wrong on the initial issue , but again you `` do n't know why i have posted it '' . 
  sadly though , seems you refuse to read any of these . 
  that 's why this will be my last response to you - no offense , though . 
  by original issue do you mean western eastern european ? 
  if so that 's very funny , thought we were arguing central europe vs eastern europe term .

  you dream of a european country that they will never let happen , each of them for different reasons : some because it will be seen as a barrier to further globalism , some because they see nationalism and pan-nationalism as the devil itself , some because they want the eu to pay back the world what it has supposedly taken ( the guilt-ridden type ) . 
  there is no one brand of europeism and your mistake , as much as it was mine , was to believe that because someone is enthusiastic about the eu , then that person wants it to be an independent , strong and fierce country . 
  that is n't the case . 
  the overwhelming majority of those people would gladly dismantle any kind of transcendantal reason a human could feel part of , whether it is a nation , a super-nation or a culture . 
  the one you are living and were born in ; also , this still applies to other poles , mr. special snowflake . 
  those are n't mutually exclusive , the timing is n't a coincidence ... c'mon . 
  funny how the euists pretend they want to save the peace of europe ... only to bring out threats of harsh response and dumb judgmement of an entire nation because the result of a referendum does n't please their globalist tendencies . 
  if you do n't develop your country , who is going to do it ? 
  you are essentially taking side for protecting the status-quo here , saying that 41 % can force 59 % to remain when they do n't want to . 
  a nation is what it is : a cohesive block of citizens , even if you do not agree with the outcome of the referendum , your duty as a citizen is to accept and show solidarity with the democratic decision . 
  otherwise human societies become atomized and it is everyone against everyone . 
  more than that !, 
  farage was excluded from the vote leave campaign . 
  he was excluded from the leave campaign ... what the hell are you talking about ? 
  they are only arrogant because they are hurt and defeated . 
  do n't be too harsh with them , reality has already beaten them up and / r/europe is the place they can gather to lick each other 's wounds . 
  that is before reality beat them up again . 
  it is useless to take this sub seriously , the europeist will only further radicalize , imitating the nationalist boogeyman they have crafted in their mind to have a purpose . 
  direct democracy is a way to get a political object legitimized by the nation 's sovereignity . 
  you can criticize the way but not the outcome of it , especially when its constitutional value is the highest . 
  do you understand ? 
  criticizing direct democracy would be saying that it does not yield the best possible outcome , but rejecting the outcome of it is straight-up authoritarianism . 
  in a secular nation , there are no higher way to legitimize your legislative object that through a referendum arch\u00ea and t\u00ealos . 
  the french have n't forgotten what happened in 2005 - it has led to the fn to become the single largest political force in the country . 
  voiding the referendum will just prove farage is right ; and the fact that you consider it an option speaks volume about your respect for democracy . 
  they will lead the first round , gather the most votes and then the `` right '' and `` left '' will coalize against them . 
  the fn is unlikely to win the national elections but they are going to send a shitload of mps to the national assembly , for the first time in history . 
  during the last parliementary elections they gathered ~ 3,500,000 votes but only got 2 mps , which tells you what kind of tsunami we are expecting for 2017 . 
  if things continue this way , with the left and right doing basically the same stuff , like they did for the past 30 years , the fn is going to take it all in 2022 . 
  it is already the single largest political force in the country atm . 
   the guy talking about juncker tusk etc had a good point . 
  rayciss scum, 
  good , thank god the europeist are idiots . 
  i ca n't wait to watch the dominos fall . 
  cet emphase , vraiment / r/cringe - worthy, 
  there would literally be a coup in france ... hollande has less than 12 % of approval ratings . 
  the fn is cruising at around 33 % in private polls for the 1st round of the coming national election , followed by the conservatives who are at 21 % . 
   more jobs and tighter border control ( less immigrants from africa ) . 
  the margin is quite reduced , there is structural unemployment in the eurozone , which is the result of policies decided by the bce to limit inflation to around 2 % . 
  mitterand is viewed as a manipulator , treatorious piece of shit by both the right , far-right and far-left . 
  and the french disavowed federalisation and the eu twice , through a referendum and a parliementary election . 
  wake-up . 
   what is ecu, 
  b-but ... if we give them handouts , this will counter-balance the desindustrialisation and the ever-increasing producing costs r-r ... right ? 
  the uk is one of the largest contributor to the eu budget , that is n't like they ca n't re-allocate their funds now that this burden is gone . 
  uk will do very well , speculators are speculating atm , you are taking your desires for reality . 
  the salt is already good but the one that is to come will be exceptional . 
   it 's not only about de and fr . 
  uk mainly exports to eastern europe for example and these countries used to get working rights in return . 
  no eu immigration - no deal . 
  de and fr export way more to eastern europe and other member states . 
  you ca n't cherry pick free movement of goods and capital only and leave out workers . 
  we will see how well this super strong resolve survive the test of time . 
  we are n't in the 90s anymore , the migrant crisis has shown it , the russian crisis has shown it , the war in mali has shown it , it is a free for all now . 
  this man gets it . 
  and this thread shows it well , how people from the cities who do n't understand what kind of doom has fell down on rural areas , who are neither the most exposed , nor the most vulnerable to globalisation , despise the more modest classes . 
  the people of the uk are n't stupid , they are exhausted and they say fuck you . 
  hopefully more follows . 
  idiots !, 
  lol - brace yourself for the koolaid hangover , you forget to talk about structural unemployment , the wonderful non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment for the euz , the desindustrialisation ... provoked by reckless free trade agreements , the massive migraiton and cultural insecurity it creates ... europeans have never been sadder than now , maybe , just maybe , money is n't everything to them . 
  2005 - never forget . 
  fuck the eu . 
  `` this is the end to trump 's campaign '' x13 `` he will never get the nomination '' x25 `` x says that trump will loose badly '' x57 - increasingly nervous american liberals, 
  this sub ... just nuke it . 
  the eu is a * suis generis * political structure , it roughly means that it is an experiment like no other in modern history and when we tied extremely heterogenous economies together through a common currency ( not for uk obv . 
  ) , free trade and the regulations that have to come with it , when we did that , we had no idea how it would turn out . 
  entering and leaving the union have that in common , but somehow remainers think that it is reckless when the other side does it . 
  france 's exports to uk represent around 41b eur ( 8 % ) - brexit will have a domino effect and the europeists chauvinism will only accelerate that phenomena . 
  it is sweet when your adversaries 's arrogance play a role in their own demise . 
  2005 never forget . 
  see , i think your condescendance is feeding the phenomena you are denouncing . 
  the english have a good word for that : self-righteousness . 
  you do realize that everyone is always convinced of the truth of the ideas they are defending . 
  common people primarily resorting to empirical data ( i.e living quality , cultural happiness etc. ), 
  to gauge whether or not they should stay in the eu is normal and to be expected in a society that is not based on human or machine slavery ? 
  you can not have anything close to a firm grasp of the dynamics and inner working of the eu without extensive research review on the topic . 
  if you believe a university course or a book does make you better than a north england fisherman who has seen his living quality plummeted and who can not recognize the country left by his forefathers in the name of londoners ' latest trendy utopia you are wrong . 
  both because you overestimate your own understanding of * suis generis * technocratic superstructure and the suffering of those who foot the bill of the blank cheque political elites have given to an entity that has started to canibalize them . 
  see constant 's comments on the freedom of the ancients and those of the moderns . 
  and be a little more humble and open minded , people are n't as dumb as you believe they are , and you are not as smart as you think are . 
   also , according to guardian 's charts , remain was preferred by people who are educated and financially sustainable . 
  could it be ... could it be that those who are the most vulnerable and suffer the most from globalism are the ones who are the most adamant about stopping it ? 
  ever heard of common decency ? 
   a huge number of people completely ignorant regarding economics or politics just possibly screwed everything up for the next generations . 
  and a minority of well educated intellectuals got their utopia crushed by the vile nationalists ... who will stand for progress ? 
  for good ? 
  for humanity against darkness and evilness . 
  ; __ ; i hate poor people now, 
  just like the eu , it did n't seem to be a problem back then ? 
  do you realize that the defiance toward the eu is at an all-time high in france , netherlands and greece ? 
  what kind of use would it be without france , greece and the netherlands ? 
  6 years `` je te l'avais dit '', 
  you are glad that our democracy is n't functionning ? 
  that the largest party in france ( wrt voters ) have 2 mps ? 
  and just so you know , ukip had only 1 mp in the british parliament . 
  the fn has shifted the political debate to the right , they have already won and it is only a matter of time before they get to power . 
  jupp\u00e9 will win . 
  he will do what he is expected to do : maintain the status-quo . 
  the fn is expected to get 100 mps in the national assembly . 
  the canibalization of the french right is accelerating , and defiance towards the eu is growing simultaneous on the far-right and far-left .

  * sigh * . 
  again these are ** different ** people more often than not . 
  those that you meet shouting for acceptance are those already in your country . 
  those that do n't really give a fuck are in ** their ** country . 
  see the difference ? 
  kinda like how brits living in france are remainers while uk voted to leave . 
  you do n't hear me shout : fuck 'em all cuz they 're just a bunch of european hating special snowflakes . 
   the us closest the us has for the eu immigrant issue is that of southern central america bypassing mexico to end up in the us and even then that population ends up being a net gain well that 's also probably due to your geography . 
  you 've got a heap ton of fucking place over there . 
  over here immigrants usually land in urban areas . 
  this leads to a rise in housing and since everything is more expensive in cities they need to be much more productive than an immigrant living in podunk in order to produce a net gain . 
  they almost form the majority in that racist country called france : /, 
   this is the one of the problems with this country , nobody thinks that refugees are valuable when they can make our country richer so your new financial capital will switch from milan to lampedusa ? 
  well am pleased we 're topping the who `` gives a rat 's ass '', 
   eastern europeans ( including ones on this sub ) hate diversity , but as soon as the uk wants to reduce immigration , they insult the uk for being xenophobic . 
  ever heard of the word demographic ? 
  i know i know it 's great but bear with me . 
  it could simply be that there 's two demographics in the same country . 
  one that wants to leave and be accepted and one that wants to stay, 
   civilization happens in multi-cultural cities , not redneck filled swamps . 
  ** correlation does not imply causation ** . 
  repeat after me that mantra . 
  the reason multicultural places like silicon valley , london or ny seem so awesome and diverse is because they have a massive stash of money and they can absorb a fuckton of resources . 
  if you put your average mississippi podunk and add your shitty indian village and add some south american favela you wo n't magically produce a new silicon valley . 
  also they 're not that diverse . 
  how many women engineers do gafa hire ? 
  but heykeep chugging the kool aid, 
  exactly . 
  i can say that sweden gave us assemble yourself furniture . 
  everybody has a shameful spot in their history or culture . 
  we should n't let that define us . 
  ethnic germans and ethnic austrians and ethnic italians but no ethnic south tyroleans huh ? 
   also , saying that 80 % of romanians listen to `` gypsy music '' is downright retarded , considering most romanians despise that kind of music . 
  gypsy music is n't manele . 
  gypsy music is similar to what bregovic or kusturica play . 
   calling someone a manelist is almost an insult here . 
  yes romanians have many weird insults , e.g. 
  the disdain for seasonal agricultural workers in spain . 
  it 's almost like they despise people who make an honest living working hard . 
  also talking about ethnic romanians as a unitary bloc is a bit weird considering that 300-400 years ago the concept of romanian did n't even exist . 
  just 3 different voivodships that would kinda speak the same language but were often at war with each other and would raid each other and try to impose rulers on each other . 
  considering that they do n't have a common history until recently ( read 150 years ) it 's kinda grand talking about `` romanian ethnicity '' . 
  but , sadly , ceausescu 's national-communism took its toll on history education and produced these myths . 
  * i avoided talking about all the other groups of turkish ( pechenegs or cumans ) or slavic migrants that had an immense beneficial impact on the medieval voivodships in order to keep it simple . 
  eh , we 'll swap our syrians for your latin americans . 
  she 's at it again http://www.euronews.com/2016/08/28/uk-to-scrap-human-rights-act, 
  quality comment yet again . 
  you amaze us kiddo . 
  we 'll tell the argies to send some exocets your way , 
  quality comment right there . 
  must be your trademark, 
  we have to know at what angle she squated so we can find out then if her genitalia or asshole were showing . 
   funnily enough it is done all the time to undocumented workers in the uk ; detention pending deportation . 
  yes many weird things happen in uk but not in france ** or europe ** http://www.france24.com/en/20120706-police-lose-automatic-power-detain-illegal-immigrants-france-court, 
   ( the perpetrator has no legal reason not to cooperate with identification they burnt their passports and they are free to claim they 're from syria . 
  i 'll stop here cuz we 're going in fucking circles . 
  that changes everything : o, 
  holy shit merkel performed a lazarus on romanians : o, 
   you would arrest them for refusing to cooperate with identification . 
  omg dude . 
  how many times does one have to tell you that you can not do that ? 
   you are detaining them based on the fact they are not allowed in the country . 
  that 's the thing . 
  you ca n't do that . 
   how do you know that their home country poses a risk to their well being ? 
  you do n't know anything about them . 
   in fact , you do n't need to even deport them back to their home , you should be deporting them back to the country they entered france from italy , congrats that solved all the problems . 
   , why has your government not detained them until they reveal where they can be deported to ? 
  i am having the same convo with / u/havejoystick but you people refuse to understand . 
  again it is illegal to detain illegal immigrants based only on the fact that they have no id . 
  it is also illegal to deport to * countries where they risk their well being * countries that they do n't belong to . 
  so there you go , you are stuck . 
  this is why your mighty pm , may wants to leave the echr because of all those pesky human rights that means you ca n't deport or arrest someone willy nilly, 
   should n't just be negative about a proposed solution but have a better one . 
  this is n't a problem that can be solved with some elbow juice and some grit . 
  there are ** legal ** issues that need to be considered . 
  but your random redditor on / r/europe cares not . 
  he wants things done pronto . 
  well it does n't work like that . 
  look at fucking australia having to close their detention centers . 
  look at the us and their 11 million illegal immigrants . 
  i really doubt there 's a solution here on this thread where people do n't even bother to google 2-3 laws . 
   second of all , get a court order , and if they are in contempt , lock them up . 
  and they say they 're from syria . 
  now what ? 
  you deport them to a war zone ? 
   first of all , laws can be changed . 
  well we 've finally come full circle . 
  the legislation is based on an international , eu , echr and national laws . 
  what you refuse to understand is that it 's not a simple issue to solve . 
  but hey go on pretending the solution can be found in a reddit forum and that you 've got it . 
   what is your solution to this problem , if i may ask ? 
  did i say i have one ? 
  it 's just that the random redditor that is shooting the breeze and saying well you just got ta do x , y and z and it 'll all be fine is just being your regular arm chair expert . 
  this is a complicated legal problem . 
  i am confused how people think this is n't the case ? 
  that 's fine and dandy but these people do n't want to apply in france . 
  so again , you do n't know where they 're from . 
  and his answer is just shit posting that does not address the problems of this issue . 
   that is when you imprison them .

democratic elections ? 
  you mean in france ? 
  i 'd say women on average are gone for 6 months and men for a few weeks . 
  i found it crazy in germany that women at work , once they were pregnant , were not seen ever again . 
  they do n't come back to work after birth !, 
  in france there are huge incentives for women to keep working and have a career and a lot of possibilities to have your child taken care of . 
  and there is no social pressure for women to stay at home . 
  though the children are now french and can not be found in the statistics because it 's illegal to discriminate on something else than nationality . 
  well we can also argue that if you do n't have kids , you do n't have jobs to keep the kids around , you do n't need so many kindergarten , teachers , nannies , supermarkets , shops for children . 
  then you miss a whole generation of young motivated people that can change things because they have a new education , etc. . 
  i 'm afraid that with this logic , it 's a vicious circle . 
  you have less and less jobs anyway with all those kids gone . 
  well kids that are expensive , it 's a political choice and a government decision . 
  lots of incentive from the government to help with child . 
  lots of child day cares that allows people to have child and a career . 
  most of children from 3 to 5 years old are encouraged to go to the kindergarten , which does not cost anything . 
  there was a time where the british rulers thought they were the real french . 
  i said civilians !, 
  and the physical devastation is debatable . 
  i 'm not sure if i 'm following you . 
  in ww1 there were 40.000 civilians deaths . 
  in ww2 , 300.000 . 
  in ww1 aviation and bombing was not really a thing . 
  in ww2 , the allies bombed french cities . 
  after the armistice , some french ( jew , political opponents . . ) had to go to concentration/extermination camp in germany . 
  nazi germany organised forced labour for french worker through the sto ( 900.000 french people ) . 
  war last from 1939 to 1945 . 
  france was occupied . 
  in 1945 a few civilian massacres occured by ss troops , for almost no reason ( killing all women/men/children in a village ) . 
  but in ww1 french civilians did not know hunger , food rationing , strafing , bombing of cities , concentration camps , force labour , racial laws ... 
  ww2 was harder for french civilians than ww1 . 
  emergency lanes are not large in germany and entry lanes are very short , if you compare to france for instance where emergency lanes are made for emergency vehicles and entries are very long . 
  it 'd be the same in france . 
  i 've never seen anyone blocking an ambulance . 
  everybody acts as in the video ( if there are no emergency lanes ) . 
  in order to prepare a dictatorship , you only organize referendum you know you will win , one way or another . 
  it has to be rigged . 
  i hope i 'm wrong but i would n't bet against erdogan . 
  yep you 're right , just nazis used it a lot for different kinds of criminal and political opponents . 
  nazi germany adopted the guillotine though, 
  the worst thing is i 'm sure she thought `` i would n't do that in the uk , but it 's corrupted france third country , so i guess it 's ok '' . 
  they 're edrising, 
  british phlegm i guess, 
  so , this map is bullshit ? 
  as far as i understand , if you have an accident at more than 130 km/h you will have problem with your insurance ? 
  france bombed serbia . 
  i mean , how can you be so sure ? 
  serbia is not russia , putin would do what he likes . 
  maybe putin would bomb you now . 
  who knows ? 
  yeah , it seems they had nothing too serious , like only 23mm guns on trucks and some sa-7 . 
  that 's easy to say though , i think it was some quite dangerous helicopter missions france & britain flew . 
  yeah , the us wants to control everything , and then it 's our fault if we can not go without them ... let the european buy european aircraft and helicopters and other weapons so we can really be independant and have stronger industries to create those missing armaments . 
  maybe we should collaborate more like we did in the 50s/60s . 
  or maybe the us can also buy some european made armaments so everyone learn from everyone . 
  well it 's not that black or white . 
  the us through nato helped europe armament industry after the war . 
  european aircraft participated in nato competition for nato fighter choices and with a lot of us funding . 
  us thought at those time it would be better for europe to build their own aircrafts if they could and that 'd help the countries to move forward . 
  well , if china has to go to europe and attack us , i guess we 'd be more than enough , except if china does n't want to defend its territory, 
  i 'm not sure what kind of defense they had in lybia ( and how they were manned ) , but france did n't lost any attack helicopters ( tigre ) . 
  what are combat aircrafts ? 
  they include attack helicopters ? 
  why not presenting the bill to russia ? 
  because if they were and still are a threat , they are the reason for all these spendings . . 
  you mean apocalypse is not coming and god will not descend on earth this time ? 
  rats, 
  you think ? 
  political european union never hit much the uk did n't it ? 
  without the uk maybe we 'd be far more advanced now ( european union army maybe , some other stuff ? ), 
  there are several versions of tintin in congo . 
  the last ones have some dialogues/things removed/changed . 
  i think we can all agree that it 's nice that herg\u00e9 did not put all of his political views into tintin . 
  he would not put tintin into those situations because he did n't put tintin into ww2 or other things first . 
  that 's just when tintin was drawn . 
   does anyone really want a trade war ? 
  no , i guess that 's why we set up the eu , to avoid those kind of trade wars . 
  maybe they 'd like to join our club ? 
  yep , there are a lot of aeronautics and it jobs in the area, 
  sometimes they work in bigger cities , for instance toulouse ( with lots of jobs ) is 1 hour and a half drive from there . 
  there are also jobs in montauban . 
  so you can live in a small village and have a `` normal '' desk job in a city nearby . 
  well the us have already elected their le pen so ... i 'm not sure what they are fearing for us . 
  well in ussr and china millions of people died because of corruption , bad ideas , dictatorship etc. . 
  it 's not the case in the eu . 
  i thought you meant the sheer amount of people they had to kill in china or reeducate . 
  killing those millions of people in china was also not easy you know . 
  a german exchange student in the us decided to enter someone garage and got shot . 
  so , in the us , do n't trespass . 
  he did n't . 
  then the country was proud to be the holy roman empire . 
  there is no open-door policy for economic migrants in europe . 
  or does he talk about refugees ? 
  russian orthodox and catholics are not us christian cults . 
  they find it unacceptable but that does n't mean they do n't do it . 
  and the ones finding they do n't really care does n't mean it 's ok for them to do it in their mariage . 
  exactly , that should be the second statistics to be displayed . 
  the question is not about you but about marriage in general . 
  people do n't care what the neighbor is doing in france . 
  true , restaurant owner will follow you in the street trying to give your money back,

  if it was a question produced by the human mind , i want to know what were the reasons for such a question . 
  what created that `` if '' . 
  did a random phrase generator create it ? 
  you are being asked how the french state is reponsible for creating terrorists . 
  you claim that is possible . 
  state your reasons . 
  wtf are you talking , are you xenophobic or something ? 
  a french is not more likely to commit a terrorist attack than an irish , a british , an italian whatever . 
  since when it xenophobic speech allowed here ? 
   if a french citizen becomes a terrorist , for whatever reason , do you not believe france has a responsibility ? 
  why would france have any responsability ? 
  state your reasons . 
   so if a french citizen ( for example ) becomes a terrorist , you do n't think france has some responsibility there ? 
  how ? 
  state your reasons . 
  inline you , i do n't projet so i have no clue what you 're talking about . 
   why should that be legal ? 
  again : i stated my reasons . 
   that 's not doing anything except trying to absolve yourself of any responsibility . 
  what responsability ? 
  40 years is the facto . 
  life is de jure . 
  let 's be honest no one stays for life . 
  which i agree , why should i pay for an old dude that can barely hold himself . 
  let him out in the world , make a living . 
  the `` without trial '' is ** all ** in your head . 
  ** all ** . 
  why do you expect a conversation with people if in reality you 're projecting ? 
   and they should n't . 
   and it 's illegal right now and should remain so . 
  because ? 
  other than it gots to stay like that ? 
  i doubt it . 
  he said he was planning attacks in belgium . 
  might be parallel construction also . 
  who knows . 
  `` generally '' means nothing when law systems are involved . 
  it 's either illegal or it is not . 
  in the case of france it would be legal if the parliament passes a law in that respect . 
  neah in the case if france , sarkozy `` re-organise '' the services . 
  it was a mess . 
  well the act has been done . 
  of course no . 
  we should punish hard terrorists not muslims . 
  people tend to confuse the two on both sides of the spectrum : oh if we punish the terrorists too hard the muslims will think we 're focusing on them . 
  and on the right end of the political spectrum it is the same thing . 
   treat them as the murderers and shit sacks that they are , and properly apply the full weight of the law . 
  they are not simple murderes or sacks of shit . 
  they are not simple serial killers . 
  they have an ideology backing them . 
  he is a military man after all . 
  you can also mention sven mary ( the lawyer of abdeslam ) that said that his client is fully compliant and has not renounced his right to remain silent . 
  yeah ... apparently abdeslam forgot a few things . 
  thanks mary . 
  heh , you 're right !, 
  we should then also stop any of the policies and politicians that will result in us seeing our isis fighters returing home peacefully . 
  france has the highest number of isis fighters from the western world . 
  belgium beats france in per capita numbers . 
  we 'll have a fun few years in europe . 
  he was right just once . 
  if we stop erdogan we 're increase his accuracy by 100 % . 
   abdelsalam was found through a suspicious pizza delivery . 
  crazy times we living in . 
  that 's a bit too quick . 
  the chain of events : * 6 policemen were checking an apartment they thought was abandoned ( rented by someone suspected to be a terrorist ) . 
  * abdeslam was in there , shootings start , he escapes . 
  panicked he calls friends to a hideout . 
  * one of the friends he calls informs the police of his phone number * the police use that to track it to several possible locations . 
  * in one area , someone makes a large pizza order , so they suspect more he 's there . 
  if you read the news , you 'll see they raided other parts in brussels like jette . 
   removing one 's citizenship is not doing anything to adress the problem itself no one believes that citizenship removal would solve terrorism . 
  people are just saying that citizenship is an important aspect , it is something you strive for , it is not just a piece of paper . 
  if someone commit an act of treason , they can get the worst punishments . 
  terrorism should be considered as treason . 
  you desire the destruction of your country . 
  if there were a button a terrorist could push to destroy his or her country , that terrorist would push it . 
  symbols are important . 
  we fight for flags . 
  100 years ago people died to put the french or german flag on a piece of muddy land . 
  for that tiny symbol . 
  why do terrorists burn their passport and film it ? 
  it is a symbol . 
   for real , how can people still not see that taking everything away from a person only helps extremism . 
  i am a binational . 
  i would also risk being deprived of my citizenship if i commit terrorist attacks . 
  you ** can not ** render a terrorism more extreme that he or she already is . 
  and a binational like myself does not feel more inclined to terrorism . 
  heck i even support that measure . 
  man do n't you know . 
  the san bernadino terrorists were like suuper poor . 
  they only had iphones . 
  that 's cheap-ass poor man . 
  also look at the spike in terorist attacks in poland , romania . 
  it 's obvious : poor leads to terrorism . 
  how can you not see it ? 
   the end result in this case i think , leads us to poverty . 
  okay let 's start here . 
  what is the group of people that are the poorest and most descriminated against in europe ? 
  okay okay i know the gypsies . 
  they even went through the holocaust .

so the last example was the former supreme commander of the allied forces in the battle against one of the worst regime that has plagued the planet while trump is an ex reality tv show star . 
  the fuck , usa . 
  that 's not exactly it . 
  the issue is that some countries prefer a weaker military they control and get things down than risking an european bureaucratic mess that ca n't agree on anything . 
  then comes the issues of where the hardware is going to be built , at what cost and where it is garrisoned . 
  even within a country , it is not clear cut . 
  for example france have tried to push integration with the german army while at the same time holding back because its army has its own philosophy when it comes to the shape of its armed forces ( nuclear aircraft carrier and rafales for example ) . 
  it is not a simple endeavour at all . 
  me neither but there is only so much we can do to avoid it . 
  such a war makes no sense , no matter how you look at it . 
  so , if he decides to go for it , it means h he ca n't be reasoned with anyway . 
  they already have the kolaningrad oblast for baltic sea access . 
  and baltic sea is the worst for military operations , you are in anti ship missile range all the way to the northern sea . 
  true and until today , i expected marine le pen to win 40 % of the votes but sill lose . 
  now , all of my expectations have been thrown out of the window . 
  well , yes to the polish border , it is very likely . 
  the distance is short and the baltic states are indeed too small to stall the russians long enough for europe to reinforce in time if they manage a surprise attack ( which is by no mean easy by the way ) . 
  as i said in my first post , the baltic states are indeed threatened but that 's the extent of russia conventional power . 
  and the only way they manage to hold the ground against a counter attacks is by threatening to use nuclear weapons . 
  in the end , the baltic states are not worth any of this , which is their best defense . 
  they do n't have to be undefeatable , they need to be enough trouble to not be worth it . 
  i provided a source from a respected russian geopolitical expert that says they ca n't do it . 
  where is your source and how credible is it ? 
  i am not trying to downplay you guys . 
  your small size makes you vulnerable , true but it also means you are a prize small enough that we need to rise the cost of your conquest high enough for it to be a self defeating enterprise . 
  frankly , i do n't think it is possible to make the baltic states invulnerable to invasion considering how little defensive depth you have and how far away you are from the core of our air superiority bubble . 
  but it is do-able to make the cost so high to discourage an agressor . 
  in that sense , i do fully support the eu garrisoning troops ( a mecanized infantry division for example ) there . 
   he 'll bet on europe pussying out this is a bet he is going to lose . 
  france and germany are of the same mind when it comes to the european union defense and i do n't think brexit changed things enough for the uk to not get involved in some continental action : this has been their stance since the napoleonic wars after all . 
  if these countries go , the rest will follow as everyone would realize it is in their own best interest to join the war effort rather risking having to fight russia alone one day . 
  french far right is weird . 
  yes , they are pro russia but they are also extremely nationalistic so the moments french soldiers would die on the field , they would flip flop on the issue and go full `` support our troops '' , same as they did against nazi germany before we were defeated . 
  if marine le pen was elected then yes , things may go in a different direction than what i predicted . 
  and i was about to say `` that would never happen '' but that would be silly to think that today . 
  it is kind of annoying to hear that we , the french , do n't care about defending the eastern countries considering how involved we are in the defense of the european union , both inside its frontiers and outside them . 
  we would like to avoid a second cold war , true enough but we are not about to give up on allies we are legally bound to defend . 
  i follow french geopolitics very closely and there is an ( edit : almost ) universal agreement among our political class that in case of a russain agression , we would send our whole army to help . 
  in the curent state of the russian army , europe can stand its ground , even without the usa support . 
  not because the european armies are that strong but because the russian army is still a shadow of its former self ( experts say they only have between 50k ~ 100k troops that are up to nato standards in equipment and training [ source ] ( http://www.lopinion.fr/blog/secret-defense/en-ukraine-kremlin-a-t-il-reellement-moyens-militaires-ambitions-21830 ) in french , sorry but the guy they quote , pael baev is [ the real stuff ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pavel_baev ) ) . 
  the only move poutine could do we could n't counter would be an invasion of baltic states so swift we ca n't reinforce in time , followed by a declaration of protection of the newly conquered territories by russia nuclear arsenal . 
  he would have to risk a nuclear war for very little gain but in theory , that is a move that can possibly succeed contrary to something like the invasion of poland or romania where he does n't have the manpower to control countries this size . 
  remember that when russia invaded czechoslovakia in 1968 , it did it with 500 000 soldiers . 
  it no longer has that much strength in number . 
  bill clinton sent troops in europe to sort out the mess in bosnia , bush amplified the middle east clusterfuck . 
  to be honest , no one knows really how many civilians we ( the french ) killed with our airstrikes either . 
  we seem to try harder than the russians to strike only military targets but it is foolish to think that we somehow managed to get a 100 % clean record with nearly 2000 strikes . 
  and as we ca n't perform enquiries on the ground and have little incentives to do so , it is unlikely that we know precisely if a strike had collateral damages and how much . 
  it is true than manpad lacks the range to shoot down airplanes at their cruising altitudes . 
  but if they are shot at the planes suring take off or landings , they can still be devastating . 
  nationalists have been labeled as such in france for decades if not for the entire xxth century . 
  fyi , your source is heavily controversial in his field . 
  you should take all it is saying with a healthy amount of skepticism . 
  it is reallly hard to say . 
  mostly because the actual capacity of fighters is heavily depending on how radars , electronic counter measures , stealth and missiles capacity all work together . 
  and the * actual * capacities of all these things are confidentials ( you get some data out on the internet with radar cross sections , radar power output , missile range but they do n't tell all the story ) . 
  there has n't been a combat scenario between state of the art fighters that has not been one sided for more than 30 years so there is no good combat data either . 
  i expect the rafale to perform better than a sukho\u00ef because the russian army had been craving for founding for almost two decades but that 's just a guess of mine . 
  the eurofighter was designed as a air superiority fighter from the start while the rafale was meant to be a mulriole fighter . 
  when it comes to air superiority , their performance should be about the same ( yes , i * know * there are differences when it comes to dofighting but they both can perfom about the same when it comes to missile fights which is what matters in this day and age ) . 
  problem for the eurofighter is that the need for air superiority fighters have diminished while the need for multirole fighters have increased drastically since the end of the cold war as the threat of competing with russia for air superiority decreased while the need for fighters that can do recon and air support without the need to be escorted , rose in proportions . 
  the eurofighter manufacturers are trying to make the eurofighter in a multi role fighter now but it seems the rafale will still be a league ahead in that domain . 
  no we do n't . 
  no one can intercept a saturation strike . 
  look it up . 
  the fact that russia thought that crimea was worth taking those risks makes me believe that russia is both opportunistic and very old fashioned when it comes to the school of thought that power comes from land . 
  if you look at a economic and strategic point of view , crimea is a money sink and control of the black sea does n't give any significant military advantage considering the mediterranean sea is a death trap for any navy that is not in nato anyway as it is almost impossible to get out of range from anti-ship missile both land and air carried . 
  the logical conclusion is that poutine move in crimea is not a move born out of strength but a move born out of weakness as the conventional blance of power is now overwhelmingly in favor of nato . 
  the move in ukraine is a demonstration of force , using their nuclear weaponry as a backbone for their weaker conventional forces . 
  that 's why sanctions are ineffective : poutine is looking for a military equal ground with nato , not a trade partner . 
  you do n't seem to realize how close we have been many times to full nuclear warfare during the cold war or you would n't say something as naive as `` cold war worked out fine '' . 
  and those who do n't understand russian mentality are those thinking the sanctions are going to soften russia attitude . 
  poutine is not scared of sanctions he can use to demonize the west . 
  not sure about that . 
  it does n't look like they are achieving anything except escalating russian nationalism even higher . 
  we really do n't want another cold war with a country who can nuke all of us . 
  even if they do n't want to , accidents happen like the 1995 norway rocket incident . 
  moreover , increased economic exchanges with the rest of the world is the best way to make a country behave as they have much more to lose than if they are effectively closed off . 
  see north korea . 
  yeah , high command went full retard . 
  we could n't have won anyway because of our inferior air force but we definitively could have done better . 
  not that it would have made any difference for poland anyway , being sandwiched between russian and germany and all . 
  i think that ship has sailed . 
  bringing the subject of reparations nowadays is just creating resentment and not achieving anything , especially consideinrg those shouldering the burden of the reparations would be mostly current germans not even born at the time . 
  for me , there is not such thing as inheriting the sins of our fathers . 
  yeah , those who think the uk is going to get close with the country which is regularly probing its airspace with strategic bombers are quite delusional . 
  for france , we are having terrible [ wild fires of our own ] ( http://www.ouest-france.fr/sites/default/files/styles/image-640x360/public/2016/08/11/incendies-pres-de-marseille-le-feu-toujours-pas-maitrise-jeudi-matin_0.jpg?itok=dk9jgbc_ ) currently so we ca n't help . 
  otherwise , they would have obviously been sent to portugal . 
   during the cold war germany was nothing but a speed bump and target for all sorts of nukes to slow down the east . 
  why would anyone want to fight and die as a speed bump ? 
  actually , west germany was considered undefensible without nuclear weapons for most of the cold war , true but in the beginning of the 80s , a new military doctrine called [ airland battle ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/airland_battle ) was created in which framework , it was possible to defeat the numerously superior armor forces of the warsaw pact . 
  not saying it would have worked ( fortunately , we will never know ! ), 
  but it was n't as grim as you say for west germany . 
  i do n't know which decision i would take in this situation . 
  we always speak of war about dying for his country , but it is mostly about making your ennemy die for * his * country . 
  i have trouble imagining myself dedicating all my concentration and will at aiming to kill my fellow man because he carries a different uniform . 
  in france , we have very bad memories of mass conscription since the two world wars and the algerian war . 
  i think the common view is that nowaday , war is a job for professional soldiers . 
  and military speaking , it has some truths in it . 
  might explain that .

  the sanctions of the eu are essentially for the american interests . 
  how much french corporation are willing to share their loot to frenchmen ? 
  what you said is completely irrelevant . 
  france is part of the eu . 
  french interests are de facto eu interests . 
  for fuck sake , is it that difficult to understand ? 
  the fact that you consider that french interests are not european interests means everything . 
  if you consider that french interests have exactly the same value that american interests as a member of the eu , you completely missed the point of the eu . 
  it 's still completely impossible . 
  do n't dream uk and us , france is more than likely to be the only western power that is not lead by crazy nationalists . 
  even after 3 terrosrist attacks , frenchmen will be smart . 
  same . 
  i wanted to say `` politically educated '' . 
  in france , there is a participation rate of 80 % in presidential election , which contrasts a lot with the ~ 50 % of the us . 
  it 's also well-known that we debate strongly for everything ( even ridiculous things ) , which causes us a lot of mockery for our famous strikes . 
  also , we have by far the most left-wing political landscape in western countries , with a lot of intervention of the state . 
  there is no way lepen can win , and this is the fact . 
  all this sub is sure she has a chance , but you really do n't understand how the vote is organized in france : she has absolutely no chances . 
  this is not comparable . 
  all the polls where not that clear for trump and brexit . 
  the polls are super crystal clear that le pen will lose by something like 65 % - 35 % , at best . 
  i work in a very international place and every angophone believe that le pen already won . 
  i guess it 's kind of wishful thinking , they just ca n't imagine that france will not be in the same crappy boat . 
  she ca n't win . 
   way more educated we have this conversation in your native language . 
   63 % say immigrant integration is n't working we have high expectations , and it 's true that it could be way better . 
  it does n't mean that 63 % are against immigration . 
   35 % of french people consider themselves `` quite '' or `` a little '' racist which is the maximal percent that le pen will have for the next elections . 
   34 % of french people consider `` islam '' as something negative we have a very negative view of religions in general . 
  and it 's a good thing . 
   50 % consider islam a menace to `` national identity '' would like to see the original poll because i 'm sure there is a problem of translation here . 
   20 % hold anti-semitic views and 80 % think they 're morons . 
   france banned the hijab in schools , and attempted to ban the burkini and it 's not really a bad thing in our secular model . 
  we do n't like religions , period . 
   where the black justice minister is welcomed with : `` hey monkey , go and eat bananas '' no more % ? 
   where the twitter hashtag #ifmydaughtercomeshomewithablack trends if twitter was representative of a country , trump would not be the president of the usa right now . 
   where black/asian/arab people are seated in the back of restaurants in how many restaurants ? 
  i guess it 's anecdotal . 
  for the moment , the favourite ( jup\u00e9 ) is ahead of lepen at the 1st round . 
  you do n't imagine how impossible the 2nd round will be for her . 
  say thanks to de gaulle . 
  he predicted that both the usa and the uk were not reliable and that nuclear weapon for france was an absolute necessity . 
  now we realize how fucking right he was . 
  imagine a world with just trump , putin , xi jinping and putin with nuclear weapons . 
  seems history has n't taught you anything . 
  france is way more educated and progressist than the anglosphere . 
  putting france in the same bag than the uk and the usa is just being completely ignorant . 
   marine le pen will probably win in 2017 . 
  lol no . 
  frenchmen are not as stupid as americans and brits . 
  http://www.globalfirepower.com/countries-listing-europe.asp france is the biggest military power in europe . 
  period . 
   uk ranked above france in every military index i can find . 
  here 's an article . 
  check your article . 
  the ranking is a complete non-sense . 
  france is superior on every metrics ( active personnel , tanks , aircraft , nuclear warheads , aircraft carrier ) except for one more submarine for uk ( 11 vs 10 ) . 
  also , the most important metrics is nuclear warhead . 
  france is far ahead , particularly compared to the uk 's nuclear deterrent that is not independent : http://www.globalresearch.ca/britains-nuclear-deterrent-isnt-independent-is-a-british-prime-minister-really-free-to-strike-any-target-in-this-world-with-nuclear-weapons/5536475, 
  very good d\u00e9cision . 
   the most important nations in this future force will be in order of importance germany , france , italy , spain , benelux , austria , portugal . 
  germany ahead of one of the only country of the world able to deploy nuclear weapons ? 
  france is ahead germany , by far , this is not even the same league . 
  this news was not even reported in the french media . 
  normandy was a vassal duchy of france ( not a kingdom ) . 
  pretending that it was two separated things is not honest , but believe it if you want . 
   the french were scary motherfuckers even way before napoleon . 
  well , globally , france has actually the most successful military history . 
  sarkozy is a notorious atlantist ( pro-nato , pro-us , even his son claims he 's more american than french/european ) , i 'm not surprised by his stance . 
  this guy would fuck the eu if it can please his masters . 
  i 'm not happy with the internal politic of hollande , but for the international , he 's for sure less toxic than sarkozy . 
  i really hope he will not be elected . 
  that 's exactly why brexit is the best thing that happened to the eu since its birth . 
  churchill 's quote : `` if britain must choose between europe and the open sea , she must always choose the open sea . '' `` every time i have to decide between you and roosevelt , i will always choose roosevelt . '' uk chose since the beginning his side . 
  exactly . 
  we need you , germoney . 
  together , we can finally be relevant again . 
  i 'll never forget the massive amount of points armenia give to france at every eurovision ( even when we do n't deserve it ) . 
  not really a neighbour , but definitely a true friend . 
  southern europe has just higher standards . 
  but it 's still less the case than france ( and usa and russia as 2nd and 3rd ) : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_time_zones_by_country, 
  this is not a lost empire in the case of france . 
   you watch football or rugby , england/france is pretty big for us ( perhaps another one-sided rivalry ) ... do n't know , but it 's interesting because in this case the situation is reversed : in rugby , england becomes the country with a lot of neighbourgs and france rather isolated . 
   same in football , italy is definitely our biggest enemy . 
  not in my opinion . 
   grouping us together with the normans ? 
  thinking we like the english ? 
  the only people we like are the celtic british . 
  i like the welsh because we basically have the same anthem . 
  i did n't group bretons/normans ( even if , c'mon , you 're close ) , just said than both of them feel close to british . 
  for nomans , it 's fucking obvious given the fact that england was technically normandy during several centuries . 
  the whole medieval english culture and aristocracy root from guillaume le conqu\u00e9rant ( william the conqueror ) . 
   thinking we like the english ? 
  i said british for a reason . 
  english was more for normands , welsh for bretons . 
   the only people we like are the celtic british . 
  i like the welsh because we basically have the same anthem . 
  i know and that what i wanted to say . 
  i think the only `` rivalry '' we can imagine with you was during the roman empire ( mainly because of ast\u00e9rix ) , but it 's a little bit complicated because we 're also part of the roman empire heritage in many ways ( particularly the south of france with many coliseum and roman vestige that we are rather proud ) and we do n't clearly identify the roman empire as modern italy . 
  for the rest , we know that you 're one of the only respectable culture for food and art in europe , but it 's more respect than rivalry .

source ? 
  i 'm skeptic to the fact that we 've actually asked the people that are just saying that their conditions of living are rubbish in the refugee camps that we 've provided told someone they were `` reuniting '' with their families . 
  even the people on the syrian civil war subreddit say that this group is long gone . 
  especially after all the capable soldiers are gone and that isis kills assad . 
  people will be wishing he had stayed . 
  nice moral authority there , i forgot you were an expert at leading middle eastern countries . 
  next time you 're president of syria give me a call , and tell me how easy it is to try to hold a country together after the us actively started creating conflicts in the area . 
  because i do n't know about you , but when i 'm leading syria there 's nothing better than just dropping chemical bombs on people for no rational reason to be hated by everyone . 
  oh give me a break , not 100 % of syria is constantly at war , there are always regions that are at peace somewhere , some can lead peaceful lives , but your logic is terribly individualistic . 
  feels like `` well we ca n't understand we have white/european privilege you see ! '', 
  bull shit , if my country is attacked , i defend it , not for me but for the sake of my countrymen , not only my family but any family . 
  they probably ca n't be nasa engineers , but like you said , tough luck , it certainly is n't our problem , as human beings we all have to set our standards somewhere to not be disappointed : i suck at math/some reason  too bad i 'll never be a nasa engineer  i should set my sights elsewhere . 
  it 's not our fault they wont be nasa engineers , it 's not our fault nasa is so popular . 
  they have their lives , like i have mine . 
  and how many refugees ? 
  well clearly you 're so smart you should be at the head of our government , hell , any government since you just found out that france and probably any european country has the funds to save homeless people , but why oh why is not doing anything , this is a travesty !, 
  it seems it 's a conspiracy against homeless people , because clearly we have the funds to save them but are n't doing anything !, 
  worst even , not doing anything and helping refugees that are fleeing war ( most of them ) . 
  or maybe it 's just that , morally it 's easier to pretend homeless people are not there , and that we 've run out of money , and that the holy german empire will not allow us to not help these people . 
  we 're unable to treat our own homeless countrymen `` humanely '' ( according to the declaration of human rights ) , so we should hold these refugees from another continent higher ? 
  i do n't know ? 
  from the country that literally has almost no immigrants . 
  should be problem  ask `` eu flag ''  solution ? 
  or the greek crisis , or the transatlantic agreement ... 
  i mean , that would be the final solution ... if you know what i mean . 
  i hope one day we can all fight once again in a friendly rivalry kind of way . 
  still better than being ruled by britannia, 
  there 's a difference between creating it and purposefuly funding terrorists to make the region unstable ... 
  i mean it is your fault they 're here . 
  plot twist 8 : denmark actually could n't see dead people , but really it was eating chicken fried steak at cracker barrel 's, 
  well , at least one of these countries has experience in invading if you know what i mean, 
  plot twist 6 : i ca n't even read words, 
  do more ? 
  we 're already knee deep in debt , struggling ourselves to get by . 
  i do n't get the hypocrisy , if you really want to help people whose rights are being violated , start close by and house a homeless person you 've never met in your house . 
  but no one does that right ? 
  because it 's dangerous , because that person could be dangerous . 
  i apply the same logic to migrants , they 're people , and we do n't know them , and we already have enough problems ourselves . 
  thanks , keep me updated please, 
  i tried and found it to be really not helpful at all, 
  damn , i really wish someone took the time to translate this video , it would really raise awareness . 
  could you explain what they 're saying ? 
  on strique alors !, 
  i do n't get it , it 's the same in france , most of the far left can easily get violent in the name of anything , and are called antifas , they 're hated for the most part , so i do n't see why in sweden the far left would be `` less violent '' than the far right ? 
  how do we even know they were `` moderate '' ? 
  what were the criterias for the rebels that died to qualify them as moderate ? 
  it is , sadly , and i consider it to be awful 8/10 times . 
  `` what are you doing '' `` eh no need to be agro about that wall mate.i 'll tell you what , after i 'm done buildin ' that border maybe we can get together and have a durry and pash things out . 
  i just got some grog from the bottle-o and threw some snags on the barbie . 
  come on , ya cunt , we ai n't so bad . '', 
  australians , everytime . 
  ok , but you 're still not getting nord-pas-de-calais back - france, 
  i 'm seriously beginning to think that once these people outnumber us , we will be in trouble . 
  pls remove, 
   as long as we win afaik we win pretty much everytime . 
  what ? 
  lol, 
  it 's easy , i think valls just means `` kill everyone until everyone is killed and then there is no problem '' . 
  what do you mean ? 
  to me cap is a diploma and strasbourg is a city , you 'd need to narrow down the aim of your question . 
  what a piece of shit, 
   might more like extremely low wages . 
  the reason why unemployment is low in germany is because the wage can be ridiculously low . 
  what you have to understand about france is that currently the political situation in france is completely fucked , we are absolutely not represented right now , if we were we would probably be looking for ways to bail out of the eu . 
  he 's a troll , or pretty much being very ironic, 
  the police already brought a light tank there , so ... 
  the french government made shelters for them , they refused to move there . 
  were crusades/jihads related wars ( the initial ones , not the retaliations ) to defend religious brothers ? 
  how is that not tangible ? 
  jihad = you fight for god defending your country = you defend your countrymen, 
  because they 're my countrymen , we may not have the same values but we are united , if the country was attacked i 'd expect them to fight as well . 
  no it 's not ? 
  dying to defend countrymen / = / dying for god ? 
  how are we `` pathetically xenophobic '' ? 
  like that other guy said : that 's really funny coming from an american . 
  ... how ? 
  i do n't believe anyone here realistically believes that all third worlders are idiots who just wants to come here . 
  and if you believe that the people here are stupid enough to think that , you should re-evaluate your morals . 
  is he wrong ? 
  am i the only one who sees how insane this is ? 
  this refugee crisis has become so bad that now we have to put borders between ue members ? 
  well to me there 's a huge population crisis in germany and apparently there are n't enough youths . 
  supposedly these refugees would pay the retirement of todays middle aged workers . 
  but i do agree that this situation can not get better , and this crisis will evolve . 
  that 's as american as you could have said it . 
  human kindness ? 
  lol . 
  more like cheap manpower, 
  mine, 
  not exactly , we 're tired of paying for people who want to go there and that are n't french anyways . 
  yeah right it 's not like the opinion of the people who voted matters right , it 's not like it 's their country after all, 
  chomsky is n't a communist , but whatever apparently the market is more important than the votes of the people of the uk ; i mean , who cares right ? 
  i 'm french , and i feel like the turk on the jew thing . 
  it 's just a small minority of hundreds that want to change your way of life . 
  quick , call the karma police ! . . 
  no one is going to riot in fear of being called racist, 
  then start with the germans and then make a deal with us . 
  we 'll never let go of the south until then . 
  the eu flag was our historic territory and it was captured by the german who ended up turning it into the eu flag , we had to fight our way up , and had to kill nepal , to name a few, 
  this deal is unfair to the french people that has suffered enough to the hands of the cruel germans which destroyed our flag with the help of r/europe !,

  some of what they do is not only ethically unexcusable , it 's also actively against their interest . 
  one of their favorite games is to set fire to something , wait until the firefighters show up and drop stones , bricks and cinderblocks on the fire truck . 
  the result now is that firefighters will wait 15 minutes for a police escort before going into a project . 
  15 minutes is enough for a lot of people to die in a fire . 
  likewise , public transport such as buses have been shot at with ak-47s and shotguns . 
  a lot of bus lines have been discontinued , either temporarily or permanently , and the people in the projects who work have more and more trouble getting to work ( the projects are usually badly connected to public transit to start with ) . 
  so to recap , you 've got : voluntarily dense population , with cultures different from the rest of france , poverty , a sort of self-sustained existence from which it 's hard to get out ... add all that and you 've got people feeding into a cycle of hate on both sides that keeps making the situation worse . 
  given the area of paris they were protesting in , i doubt any of the looted shops had any iphones or nikes . 
  probably more like a couple of kebabs and a counterfeit t-shirt or two . 
  so doctors the world over are part of a global network of spies-for-hire ? 
  that explains so much ... 
  i 'm a idealist , so to me any voter turnout that 's below 100 % is too low . 
  seriously , 80 % turnout means 1 french person out of 5 did n't care enough to use their right to select weep would be the next leader of the country . 
  that 's ... not the way politics * should * work , in my book . 
  kids learn about the workings of the state in french schools . 
  what the parliament does , the difference between senate and assembly , how laws are passed , that sort of stuff . 
  that 's in middle school for the basics , and in high school you learn a little more about , say , the centralized system of the state , the roles of different ministries or agencies , the judicial system , etc. 
  back when i was in school , i did n't learn about the various parties and leaders and opinions . 
  i think the reason it 's not taught is because you do n't want the teacher to introduce their opinions on a lecture and influence the kids . 
  the end result is just that kids end up having the same politics as their parents . 
  i did , for the first 20 years of my life or so , but funnily enough i were n't to the exact opposite once i got personally involved . 
  well , that ... kind of explains why they wo n't go anywhere . 
  unless they resort to terrorism , but i do n't think they 'd want to . 
  and a bumper sticker with your religion is the best way of getting your car burned ... 
   3 ) unions are seen as slow and ineffective , and americans like efficiency . 
  they do n't want to wait 2 hours so someone can tighten a bolt or 3 so someone can unfold a folding table . 
  and they certainly do n't want things like a horeshoer at a water treatment plant that has no horses that the union makes them keep in a bankrupt city h. . . h. . . holy shit . 
  from the article :  ( ... ) the local union president said it is `` not possible '' to eliminate positions . 
  please , please , * please * tell me that 's an isolated , extreme case . 
  right , sorry for the * whoosh *, 
  they 're gon na bring him back in !? 
  i swear , this is how dictatorships start . 
  elio di rupo is going to be the best-dressed dictator in europe soon . 
  huh what ? 
  is n't he a francophone ? 
  so it was still elio di rupo ? 
  i thought he 'd been replaced already ... 
  / u/moogle1214 said it best :  there was no unified message , except that `` we 're pissed off '' . 
  you had people protesting weed laws , too big to fail , banks bonuses , unions ( both for and against ) . 
  also , and possibly because of that , the occupy movement completely failed to translate that into political action ... not even electing a couple of representatives . 
  shit , even the tea party nutcases succeeded in doing that . 
  you 're talking about the nationwide leaders . 
  some of them are good , although i would n't trust bernard thibault to ride my bicycle without breaking it . 
  the new generation of leaders ( laurent berger , thierry lepaon , etc. ), 
  look promising . 
  but those are n't the ones that intervene directly in company business - they talk to government . 
  if you take * local * union leaders , guys like edouard martin or even philippe poutou ... 
  these guys are blatantly unqualified to manage anything . 
  huh , til . 
  that citation is a lot less quotable than the one i expected , but it 's pretty funny . 
  i can speak for france , and i think the following applies to a lot of eurpe too : i ** think ** people do n't wear their opinions on their sleeves in europe the way they do in the us . 
  that includes politics and religion . 
  you do n't have `` honk if you hate obamacare '' bumper stickers , or stuff like that . 
  facebook likes are part of that , in a way . 
  people follow politics closely . 
  since our countries are smaller than the us , and with a lot more extensive governments and public sectors , a political decision will affect a lot more people ( proportionally ) than a us bill or law . 
  same for the elections : we may have relatively low voter turnout ( think it was in the 80 % range in 2012 in france ) but we 're engaged in the surrounding debates . 
  as for whether europeans are more knowledgeable ... 
  i think most europeans follow us politics , at least roughly , because it can affect us . 
  we also know the basics of foreign policy and relationships with our direct neighbors , including their heads of government . 
  ( right now , i can list them all except the belgian and luxemburger pm ... 
  sorry , guys ! ), 
  i know teachers ' unions are pretty bad in the uk , they kind of suck in france as well . 
  here , public transit workers are pretty terrible too . 
  but that does n't change the need for worker 's representation , just a different type of it . 
  few companies can afford to `` wait out '' a strike , especially if it lasts , say , a month . 
  there are orders to fill , deadlines to make , and new orders to add to the books . 
  if you ca n't make your customers ' deadlines , you lose the money you would have made , maybe you even have to pay damages to the customer ( if there is a clause in the contract to that effect ) , and your relationship with said customer could be irrepairably damaged . 
  between the company and the workers , in most cases , the company 's going to choke first . 
  no offense , but `` your generation '' ( i 'm assuming we 're roughly the same age , so it should be `` our generation '' ) has the occupy movement . 
  that 's just as stupid , if in another direction . 
  heh , steinbeck said * `` socialism never took root in america because the poor see themselves not as an exploited proletariat but as temporarily embarrassed millionaires . 
  '' * did n't think that would be so true . 
  i would n't support giving half the board to the unions , because as important as conflict resolution is , i think company strategy is more important , and strategic decisions are better handled by people who are trained and experienced with these kinds of decisions and removed from the `` factory floor '' , if you will . 
  it 's still important for unions to get their word in , but not to help steer the company . 
  but then again , that 's just my political opinion and not an objective truth . 
  i 'm sure a lot of people here would disagree . 
   for many , it 's a complete reversal of thought what do you mean ? 
  americans trust the executives/company bosses more than they trust the unions ? 
  i 've seen that in discussions with americans before , but i do n't understand the * why * of it . 
  tell me about it . 
  i 'm an oil-industry guy , have been all my life , and shell has a reputation for reaming your ass over and over with health and safety . 
  a deserved reputation . 
  they start every meeting with a `` safety moment '' , analyzing an incident or just reminding people of the safety rules of the venue they 're meeting in . 
  does n't matter if the meeting is just an office cocktail to celebrate a project 's anniversary or something - nope , you need a safety fucking moment . 
   in germany unions in companies like daimler have shares in the company and thus they are less likely to have a us vs them mentality . 
  that 's an awesome idea . 
  that 's also why i support the french plan to have 2 unions representatives systematically sit in on the executive committees . 
  if you let the workers know , give their opinion , and potentially even influence executive-level decisions , you have an opportunity to build consensus and potentially even bring them onboard with your decisions . 
   in other countries unions will tend to only strike when the company is already circling the drain , guaranteeing failure . 
  that 's what happened with the goodyear manufacturing site in northern france . 
  profits were almost nil , so there was a plan to streamline production by not replacing retirees and reducing the use of temp workers . 
  the unions were against that project , the resulting strike completely buggered production . 
  a few other groups were found , willing to buy the site and turn it around , but the unions scared all of them away , including titan ( maurice taylor 's famous letter comes from that time ) . 
  now , well , the factory is almost guaranteed to close down completely because no agreement has been found and production has been stopped for like 18 months . 
  that 's what i would like to see here , and throughout europe . 
  maybe 75 % is too high a threshold , perhaps 2/3 or even 50 % would be better . 
  still , negotiating before a strike should be mandatory . 
  here , i 've seen unions strike before negotiations ever happened . 
  i ca n't say if that 's the majority of cases , as i have n't read up on every strike in france .

  afghanistan or iraq ? 
  if you try to compare russia to afghanistan than you are just flat out retarded and no one can help you , i 'm afraid . 
  if you compare russia to iraq then you will find that the us was the main-factor during that invasion . 
  afghanistan or iraq ? 
  did you just get an attack or what ? 
  i started my sentence by ** `` france alone in the past 5 years intervened in libya , mali , centrafrica and syria/irak '' ** and you think i 'm talking about russia in iraq or afghanistan ? 
  what ? 
  let me ask you back : are you retarded ? 
  can you read and process words or you just make up things in your head ? 
   right , facts like the fact that the french population has allways been a strong supporter of their military , unlike in other european nations ? 
  or the facts that what i mentioned is the truth and a large part of a decision . 
  ( guess why some countries did n't participate in the iraqi invasion , weird right ? ), 
   but sure , apply france to every nation in europe . 
  because that makes sense ... for fucks sake . . 
  guess who else strongly supports its army ? 
  the us and the uk . 
  plus france , you have 90 % of nato , the rest will have to follow or will be kicked out of nato , period . 
   the greater impact of multiple , large political parties directly supporting russia . 
  in germany alone there is `` die linke '' and the afd , both most likely with very high results in the upcoming election . 
  in france it 's front national with strong ties to russia . 
   in a potential conflict with russia europe might run into strong opposition in their parlaments when trying to take action . 
  that would be relevant if article 5 needed parliaments approval to be triggered . 
  but it does n't . 
   because now you not only have very little support for such a conflict at home but also a potential paramilitary threat . 
  so suddenly germany and france have parliaments with a pro-russian majority , that 's interesting . 
  not based on anything remotely real or any fact , but interesting . 
  and what paramilitary threat are you talking about ? 
   look up russian military history and the history of their conflicts . 
  if i look up german military history , i should vote for a pro-russian candidate that would sign a military alliance with them against you because you 're our common enemy . 
  see how that does n't mean shit ? 
   well , back then only a few hundred thousand troops protected the border to the soviet satellite states . 
  hello , this is 2016 , where we do n't fight by sending massively little green men to protect borders . 
  you might read up on the new weapons developped in the past decades , you 'd be surprised how warfare and border protection has changed . 
   do i have to explain why that matters very little when you have dozens of splintered nations , all buying their own shit , training their own soldiers and speaking their own language and paying significantly more in salaries than russia . 
  it 's such a stupid and retarded argument that im hearing over and over again recited by left-wingers with no education in military matters . 
  and military joint exercises and operations , common equipment like standard ammunition and a central command that perfectly worked in afghanistan for example . 
  we were able to defeat and occupy a country thousands of kilometers away but within europe we would n't stand our position , which is by definition a lot easier than an offensive ? 
  and you condescendingly suggest i do n't know shit about military matters ? 
  well that 's ironic ...  nato leaders are what again ? 
  correct , heads of state . 
  what is important to heads of state ? 
  public perception . 
  what tanks public perception ? 
  when you act against the `` truth '' that people are led to believe . 
   use some common sense please . 
  yes , use some common sense and look at facts , not speculations based on your fantasies . 
  france alone in the past 5 years intervened in libya , mali , centrafrica and syria/irak . 
  but all these wars with our unemployment rate and economic situation had great public support , of course !!, 
  and you think we intervened thousands of kilometers from home but we would let a member of the european union we 're part of and that we founded wrecked ? 
  yes , get common sense please . 
  what greater impact are you talking about ? 
  russia is economically , military and politically weaker than ever . 
  sure their propaganda has some effect on some part of the population in europe , but even that is an absolute joke compared to the soviet propaganda when communist parties had 15 + % in national elections in western europe . 
  why would it have any effect on the decision makers ? 
  do you think merkel , hollande or mps use rt to know what 's going on outside nato 's borders ? 
   i feel that we 're arguing in circles . 
  indeed we are !, 
  my point is since nato exists , russia - or ussr at the time - never dared to touch with a stick a member , because all the successive leaders have been terrified of the possible consequences . 
  i mean , the ussr collapsed miserably without giving a fight , and had been constantly defied by leaders within ussr . 
  why , when russia was in a middle of the cold war , more powerful than it ever was , it did n't do anything against nato except proxy wars like afghanistan or vietnam ? 
  and now that it is economically weaker than ever , with a military that is partly completely outdated , it would attack ? 
  in the meantime , nato have more members than ever , more economic power than ever , and more military power than ever . 
  the point is not that nato would instantly nuke russia the minute a russian soldier set a foot in estonia for example , it 's just that russia would n't send a soldier to a nato member like it did n't for the last 67 years in the first year . 
  because on the contrary to what some people think , russia and putin are not entirely stupid and are also terrified of a total war with nato , and have been since the end of wwii . 
  that 's a fact . 
  the consequences of nato not reacting would be also terrible , the alliance would collapse , china will know the pacific is basically their , etc. . . 
  the us would lose its enormous influence and it 's just not going to happen . 
  so , nato will not uphold its commitment because you saw rt news on social media . 
  yeah , this port will make russia great again , sure that 's worth it . 
  nato is already a shit-show with turkey unable to un-fuck itself the last few years and most of europe cruising along saying `` 2 % military spending ? 
  nah fuck that ... '' a shit show that guarenteed the security of its members for 67 years . 
  in the meantime russia lost pretty much all its satellite states and struggling to get back a small part of ukraine . 
  but sure , nato is the shitshow . 
  and you do know that even with plenty of member not respecting the 2 % spending nato has 10 times the military budget of russia right ? 
   riiight , and now take a look at how many people believe the propaganda that rt is spreading while covering as a legit news outfit . 
  it 's all over europe . 
  france , germany , britain , sweden ... you name it !, 
  yeah because obviously , as we saw in georgia and ukraine , nato leaders follow rt to get their informations and fully supported russia . 
  no point in signing a treaty like nato then , since you 're convinced no one would follow its commitment . 
   that 's why nato should n't abandon ukraine , and moldova and georgia . 
  did they ? 
  did nato and the eu supported russia or heavily sanctionned it ? 
  did n't bush send condoleeza rice and sarkozy went to georgia himself to put an end to the conflict ? 
  did n't the us just organized a big military training in moldova that the pro-russian opposition condemned as `` an invasion '' ? 
  that 's what they get , they get support from nato , but as non-members , they do n't get the guarenteed military intervention full-members have . 
  and if a nuclear security shield and the guarentee 3 of the biggest militaries on the planet , including the us that is itself bigger than the 20 next bigger military powers is not enough , nothing will ever be . 
  explain to me how that means nato has to intervene military ? 
   except ww3 is not guaranteed . 
  nothing in these relations is ever guaranteed . 
  ...  okay , so we just create a new one . 
  league of nations -  united nations . 
  and it 's much more likely that there would just be amendments to the agreements , where they would somehow twist it out that it was okay for some of the nato nations not to react . 
  the league of nations like the un was just a platform where countries talked . 
  that 's it . 
  what does that have to do with a military treaty ? 
   countries are members of nato . 
  countries do n't always take official positions on everything . 
  sometimes it 's convenient for them not to say anything at all - just like when they divided europe after world war 2 and left a whole bunch of nation states under russian control . 
  end result is that those countries had half a century of falling behind . 
  yes , this is when we created nato , so no country would `` fall behind '' without the others to attack .

  the south of france also has a lot of castles . 
  not the same type tho , fortresses and medieval ruins/castles . 
  it promotes healthy competition . 
  it 's the european version of hunger games, 
  yep , i do n't know if most people know but now , the border with spain near my hometown is only composed of posts saying you 're leaving france . 
  there 's a police office but it 's just so they can stop dangerous people and enforce alcohol and cigarettes restrictions . 
  when i 'm able to move freely to meet neighbour countries . 
  when i had two exchanges with spain and italy when i was in high school , made me realize that we were not that much different in the end ( except the language ) . 
  eurovision , too . 
  indeed ahah, 
  wrong link man . 
   british unionism are n't all parties except snp british unionist ? 
  might aswell just include half the republican party if we go like this . 
  some of the representants are alright but most of them are just dumbfucks . 
  belgium is ours , back off . 
   i know plenty of people the people you know are define by a high number of different reasons . 
  if we go that way almost everyone i know speak at least 3 different languages ( i 'm studying english and italian at uni ) . 
  most people with an education ( baccalaur\u00e9at ) usually know how to speak in at least two more languages than french because they studied it for at least five years . 
  in the south a lot of people are able to speak spanish and english at least . 
  speaking a language means being able to converse with someone who speaks it too . 
  you do n't need to be fluent in order to do that . 
  yes , i 'd say there 's a big difference between our parents and young people . 
  the people born before 1970 usually speak only french whereas a lot of young people speak two/three or even four languages . 
  at least farage is a good source for memes . 
  david cameron the pig shagger ? 
  in 2012 , dominique strauss kahn , imf boss , favorite candidate to be elected president of france was caught raping a black woman in the hotel sofitel in new york . 
  christine boutin , the leader of french catholic 's party is married to her cousin . 
  iceland , greece and turkey i 'd say . 
  iceland because of the landscapes and hot springs , greece for the architecture , the monuments and the islands , turkey because i love turkish cuisine and i would love to see a football match in one of istanbul 's stadiums . 
  a lot of young people are either really passionated or really nihilistic . 
  the passionated ones get furious when they hear that kids and civilians are murdered in middle east , the nihilistic make memes on the internet . 
  in my hometown , the salary of the most people would be around 18k $ a year . 
  in my area , salaries are quite low , unemployement is higher that the national rate , and poverty is also higher than the national numbers . 
  well , as far as i know you will have to cross the pas de la casa and the col du puymorens which is sometimes closed due to weather conditions and then you will have the choice between going on the road to perpignan which is really crowded by buses and cars or the road to formigu\u00e8res , quillan and axat which can be quite dangerous due to fog being present sometimes . 
  either way the road might not be really pleasant because it can be really hot in the summer and really cold in winter . 
  plus the roads go up and down with big differences . 
   barcelona andorra : andorra la vella france again : montpellier , marseille , toulon i seriously do not recommand to bike through the pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es by andorra . 
  i do n't know about the state of the road on the spanish side , but on the french side , depending on the road you will choose it will either be really dangerous or really crowded . 
  can you please tell me which road you 'll take ? 
  i know the city of montpellier and you should probably just try to bike through the ecusson ( historical center ) it 's really nice with a lot of monuments like churches and big squares , it even has an arc de triomphe , just like in paris . 
  i do n't think he 's got any chances . 
  it 's not likely that the people 's party will abandon their candidate to vote for someone that 's less conservative then them . 
  they only have 68 meps so they will need other parties to vote for them , which is really not likely to happen . 
  as the new majority of mep 's are leaning right , it is most probably going to be a people 's party president , the left could compete if the united european left , the ecologists and the socdems ally ( which is not really plausible looking at the relations between these ) . 
  yes i forgot , that 's because she is n't prince charles ' first wife right ? 
  the order of succession i think is : charles , william and george ( the son of william ) . 
  if one of them dies , the other gets the crown . 
  queen consort . 
  she 's just the king 's wife . 
  charles ' the true head of state . 
  here 's the [ quai vauban ] ( https://www.sixt.fr/fileadmin/user_upload/pictures-city-page/perpignan-quai-vauban.jpg ) , it 's part of the historic center of perpignan , my hometown . 
  quite proud of it even though a lot of people will argue that it 's shit because we 're poor . 
  wwi hero , wwii either couragious or coward politician who sold half the country thinking to preserve the rest ( which definetely did n't find the target because the rest of the country was also under nazi influence anyway ) . 
  if you want to compare , in my opinion he 's clearly not as bad as hitler because the circumstances were against him . 
  petain was just old as fuck and a bit senile . 
  his ministers however were the assholes because most of them were agreeing with the reich 's plans . 
  that 's exactly how i imagine a british dog . 
  full class dog here . 
  since she 's the one who is running is marine , i was thinking about her , but her father and her niece could also be compared . 
  napoleon is not really controversial i think . 
  most of us have quite a good opinion of him , but he had one point in common with trump , the will to make a country great again . 
  le pen ? 
  i think it depends what kind of store you go to . 
  in the biggest stores there are a lot of sweets , but i think most of us live in big towns where shops are small and in those you find less sweets . 
  yep , friendly game ahah, 
  your team plays this afternoon . 
  i 'm going to the match !, 
   when at parties , a little drunk , thinking `` smoking looks fun '' yes and then all your friends assume you 're a smoker so they ask you if you go out for one cigarette with them next time they see you . 
  more shopkeepers should be like you , i remember when i first bought alcohol , i was like 13 or 14 . 
  here in france , you have to be 18 , but the law is not enforced . 
  it 's the same for alcohol but you can easily buy some by the age of 15 and even before if you look older . 
  i do n't specially like the taste of industrial cigarettes , but cigars and shisha are a good reason to smoke for me . 
  and as people said earlier it 's also used to smoke weed . 
  a lot of stoners never smoked a pure spliff because it 's expensive so we smoke weed with tobacco . 
  and also a lot of people fall into tobacco addiction because of peer pressure . 
  as you said , in my high school pretty much half the students smoked . 
   but ca n't you use a pipe or something ? 
  ca n't they be filled with a small enough quantities for economically sustainable highs without tobacco ? 
  through a pipe , weed smoke does not taste the same . 
  plus smoking a pipe is actually really stronger than a single spliff . 
  you could easily smoke one spliff after waking up if you 're used to smoking weed but if you smoke a pipe right after waking up you 're sent back straight to the bed . 
  well , that depends . 
  if he comes to live in europe , there 's a big chance that his salary will also be reduced . 
  not to mention that they actually kicked england out of their favorite sport 's competition . 
  well , i do n't really know for other countries , but some left wing movements in france also want to leave the eu . 
  but not because they do not want to be united , they want to leave because they disagree with the eu as it is ( political system/lack of democracy according to them ), 
  berlin is awesome . 
  compared to berlin , amsterdam seems to be like a sardine box , the buildings are really close whereas in berlin the streets all have big sidewalks , housing is cheaper and usually appartments are bigger . 
  amsterdam is probably a city with similar housing as london , paris or bruxelles , berlin is very atypical . 
  for the nightlife both are known to be * really * interesting , berlin has one of the world 's best nightclubs , amsterdam too . 
  weed is legal in amsterdam , but you should not have trouble finding some in berlin too . 
  berlin has lakes in which you can actually bathe , do n't remember any of that back in amsterdam . 
  i went to both places for a vacation and i really recommand you to go to berlin , lovely place . 
  edit : i forgot about it , but since it is a european capital , berlin has a lot of young people from all over europe ( and a lot of french people too ) . 
  a lot of berliners speak english . 
  french : mother tongue , speak it every day english : studying it at uni , so i speak it every day too italian : same as english spanish : use it when i 'm in spain ( which is quite a lot because i live near the border ) catalan : when the fucking cashier is up to it , because generally even though i speak catalan to them , they answer either in spanish or french . 
   right now i 'm spending my free time to learn the german language so the thought that i would getting paid for it sounds like a wet dream to me i do n't know if that 's true or not but , often when it sounds too good to be true , it 's not true . 
  i do n't know for norway , iceland and the balkan , but switzerland will never join the union . 
  it is against all their interests . 
   what i 'm strongly against and it has been in the media , is the 2-speed eu reorganization model .

  hide yo wife !, 
  hide yo kids !, 
  beware the eussr , it 's coming for you !, 
  eu is at least as far from being a massive failure than it is from being perfect . 
  more like r/im14andthisisdeep, 
  it says including data . 
  yes . 
  paris line 12 i believe . 
  i misunderstood your comment , my apologies . 
  that being said , france has had a hard stance on syria from the beginning , which i do n't think is a good idea . 
  stop that england , i 'm warning you !, 
  you 're a funny guy , i assume you believe the iraq war was a good thing ? 
  dafuq did i just watch ? 
  i read hamon ... 
  well maybe to hamon , maybe ( i doubt that or really few ) to fillon or to abstention . 
  i 'm guessing most would go to melenchon and some to macron . 
  at least some of putin 's photo could be from a gay magazine . 
  but he is anti gay like he 's secretly gay . 
  me too . 
  until i realized brexit is actually an abortion . 
  which is why the people 's representants are supposed to debate until they reach a compromise , which they are supposed to commit to . 
  that 's quite litteraly true actually . 
  as for the iraq war , the issue is n't decisiveness , but the direction they commited to . 
  sure but diversity is n't divisiveness , even more so in foreign policy . 
  yet , we 're weaker than any of them , because we 're unable to agree and fully commit . 
  actually , eu is the same size as them , except that we 're midgets in a trench coat . 
  it 's not about melenchon , i have my own doubts about him . 
   every candidate who has a '' * far - * '' prefix has indeed gone too far and lost his/her connection with reality . 
  it 's just overly simplistic . 
  you say that , but jokes aside , despite its flaws , the eu was rather protective in that regard . 
  none at all . 
  it 's simply the inevitable , logical conclusion of thousands of years of accumulated data . 
  the irish chose to die and flee their beloved homeland rather than eat english food for example . 
  but i bet you 're one of those climate change deniers . 
  fake news : - france should be first . 
  - england should be last . 
  i rest my case . 
  ha the famous bravery of the far-right , strong men full of virility , is a beautiful thing . 
  poor man . 
  this putin should be ashamed of herself . 
  says the guy whose entire country is a no-go zone . 
  edit : not to mention the australian natives must feel the same . 
  and you talk but your cities are riddled with some filthy animals . 
  since they won the war , emus think they 're the shit . 
  omg you lost a war against a bunch of chickens , my fucking sides !, 
  well ... a hasty google image search will do that to you , i 'm ashamed . 
  as penitence , i will attack russia . 
  in winter . 
   * vladimir putin a true symbol of national self - ~ ~ de ~ ~ termination . 
  * opponents agree . 
  ... thanks tunisia ... looks like it 's time to go [ full napoleon ] ( https://img.ifcdn.com/images/1980dd7a7a4e9bdebe3a166fbda19f20e5c3ff65b6be0bc59cb9c2d7856471b4_1.jpg ) again . 
   so you can stigmatise me as shill , troll , activist but i mus n't call them agent provocateurs etc. 
  `` stigmatize '' : to mark with a brand . 
  wow i did n't know i was so powerful . 
  i just stated my opinion . 
   and regarding my writings of russian and it 's affairs . 
  they will continue for as long as the west spreads their tentacles and withdraws from russia . 
  says the guy posting pro-putin narrative on reddit . 
  ironic indeed . 
  you posted this one hour ago : `` why is it justifiable for the anglo-saxon and american media to perform a coup 'd ` etat in russia federation under the pretense of some quasi rights '' talking about protests . 
  you then downgraded coup d'etat to foreign interference then to over-coverage by anglo media . 
  you then post a clip of farage , who is a clown financed by putin . 
  you seem to adhere to putin 's narrative beyond reason , what am i supposed to think except that you 're a shill/troll/activist ? 
  funny how russians shills accuse others of their own doings . 
  ironic . 
  i was n't aware of that joke . 
  but the fact that an urss joke is still relevant today is an argument in my favor , is it not ? 
  from the article :  they face 35 charges including armed violence , theft and attempted murder . 
  do the communists you talk about are charged with that as well ? 
  french communists gave us paid leave instead of eastern communist 's gulags ( edit : or nazi 's camps ) . 
  and communists `` parading '' in the media , what the hell are you talking about ? 
  first it was a coup d'etat , now its over covered . 
  and how is it over covered ? 
  who is interfering ? 
  citizens are protesting against their government 's corruption . 
  i 'd still rather be an opponent in the us than in russia . 
  why do n't we make an experiment ? 
  i 'll go to the elysee and scream `` fuck the president '' , you go to the kremlin and do the same . 
  come on , it will be fun , i promess . 
  i do n't know what they will do to snowden , but they wo n't do to him what putin did to nemtsov . 
  `` the same thing we do every night , pinky - try to take over the world ! '', 
  go proselytising elsewhere . 
  because they kill themselves more than the general population . 
  but that 's the trick , it makes potent fertilizer . 
  work only once though . 
  what are your experiences in covering paedophiles ? 
  `` no means no '' was his tweeted answer about that . 
  a fn supporter accusing may of being a nazi ? 
  i do n't think i do , i 'm sure that plays a role . 
  but even the gia attacks in '95 were motivated by religion rather than nationalism . 
  and clearly the iraq war helped created isis . 
  i did n't know thanks !, 
  ok , thanks . 
  we would lose because we suck at everything ... 
   [ sergei prokofiev ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4tyq97jcr0 ) seconded . 
  also is n't gorki a great russian writer ? 
  care to explain ? 
   i 'm just pointing out that communism and communists have different history in the west, 
  of course . 
  i 'm just pointing out that communism and communists have different history in the west , but i 'm aware that it was brutal in the east ( and elsewhere ) .

  i tried and it 's actually pretty tasty !, 
  it depends on the countries . 
  in schengen countries there should be no stops and often not even personnel there ( in like 99.0 % of the cases ) , but switzerland would be the exception there . 
  usually the cars still move through the border but they stop cars without stickers or if they want to check something . 
  austria , switzerland , slovenia : needs a vignette but only if you want to be allowed to drive on the highways . 
  france , italy : you pay a fare at toll booths at regular intervals . 
  some highways are free ( in alsace for instance ) and others are toll-roads . 
  germany : the autobahn is still free of use ( at the moment , there are talks about making a mandatory vignette as well ) . 
  and dried ham . 
  which is why salt on watermelon kinda enhances the tast just like dry salted ham enhances the taste of cantaloupes . 
   loz\u00e8re and here i thought that ni\u00e8vre was already bad ... 
  some villages seemed they came straight out of `` the hill have eyes '' . 
  absolutely , might wan na throw in avignon as well !, 
  hang around ? 
  a hardware shop ? 
  you can throw in some mars bars and milkyways if you 're feeling extra fancy . 
  are you kidding ? 
  i love reading stories like that !, 
    what made you pick that genre of music ? 
  borrowed some cds from my brother when i grew up and nevermind songs were often playing on most radio stations , it felt like a slap in the face at that time . 
  internet was n't really a thing back then so i could only have access to the few cds i would borrow from my brother or the library : mostly pearl jam and nirvana . 
  kinda stopped listening to that style for a while but later on i started listening to mudhoney , black flag , more pearl jam , silverchair , audioslave , etc , . 
  when this kind of music was more easily accessible on the internet years later . 
  i read a lot about cobain and ca n't feel nothing but sadness for the guy . 
  honestly , after reading through his biography several times i think i understand why he wanted to end it ( not that i justify it , but i think i understand ) . 
  still wish he would have found a way through though , and i do n't think that courtney was of any help in that regard unfortunately ( not that i believe the bullshit conspiracy theories , but she definitely did n't help in lessening the pressure and the heroin abuse ) . 
  i love the fact that you refer to `` the german guy '' as `` german guy '' hahaha . 
  thank you for wrinting that long paragraph , it was super entertaining to read !, 
    will have to take the time to get from frankfurt to strasburg . 
  seems ... magical and serene . 
  i think you 're lucky to be from your part of the world . 
  oh you definitely should sometime , and if you do give me a heads up and i can give you a ton of advice !, 
  the only thing about the pictures that i 've sent is that those places are usually crawling with tourists in the summer haha , but you can still find plenty of charming quiet places around . 
  i know almost nothing about oregon , i 'd definitely include it in a west coast road trip sometime in the future . 
  been thinking about that for already quite a while !, 
  cheers , it 's been lovely chatting with you !, 
   guilty of bizarre behavior . 
  once rescued 2 norwegian guys who were walking around the streets in seattle . 
  they crashed at my place for 2-3 weeks . 
  that 's what i 'm talking about !, 
    seattle 1987-2008 , there was an 18 month detour . 
  what bands do you like ? 
  alice in chains/mad season , soundgarden , mother love bone , nirvana , mudhoney , the melvins , pearl jam , audioslave , temple of the dog , candlebox , nevermore ... . i might have a stupid story . 
  holy crap , so you were there for the whole grunge thing . 
  yeah , you just listed pretty much all of my favourite bands right there . 
  i 'm all ears for the stupid story !, 
   wow , the photos of alsace ... so fairytale to me . 
  living in a place where a building that 's 150 years old is rare . 
  makes me more than happy to hit my head on 500 + year old ceiling beams . 
  wish we had villages surrounded by farmland instead of ranch style houses with big front yards . 
  and you have the chance to live in an area of incredible nature my friend . 
  i would love to visit sometimes , we lack a bit the wide open wilderness around here . 
   if you ever need a large pickup fix , we 've got you covered . 
  haha , awesome !, 
  cheers !, 
   most people are nice wherever you happen to be . 
  i still think there 's something rather unique about the people of us/canada . 
  one time me and a bunch of friends were stranded in the middle of the night outside a train station somewhere in bumfuck massachussets . 
  a middle-aged couple saw our clueless asses and simply drove us over to our hotel a good 15 minutes drive away . 
  i have tons of other examples like that of genuine generosity which are quite unique for western countries imo . 
   what 's something interesting to see in your part of the world ? 
  oh man i do n't even know where to start !, 
  i grew up in a region called alsace most famously known for it 's [ white wine ] ( http://www.vinsalsace.com/assets/img/layout/vignoble-et-route-des-vins/home/hero-m.jpg ) , [ cosy villages ] ( http://apps.tourisme-alsace.info/photos/eguisheim/photos/253000781_1.jpg ) and [ christmas celebrations ] ( https://www.voyages-sncf.com/sites/default/files/files/voyazine_article/img/import_voyazine/3224030_large_les_plus_beaux_marches_de_noel_en_alsace.jpg ) . 
  i feel true love for that area . 
  where are you actually from ? 
  north west ? 
  being a grunge fan it 's one of my dreams to check out seattle and the surroundings . 
  nah man , i had a great time there overall . 
  all the people i 've met have been genuinely very pleasant although somewhat misinformed about life outside the us . 
  but i was guilty of that too before i first visited . 
  i thought that everybody would be driving american land yachts but you ca n't imagine my dissapointment when i felt like people were mostly driving camrys , corollas and accords . 
  to be fair that was a time before getting information from google was a thing and i also had a lot of misconceptions about the us . 
  so i did n't take offense in that , just found it odd . 
  i was n't sure what was happening as i was pretty young at that time but i was like `` oh yeah supermarkets , yeah we have them too . '', 
  and i think her reaction was `` oh , okay '' followed by an awkward pause . 
  it 's relatively common but finding good cheap maple syrup is pretty hard . 
  :( i 'd be happy to have some !, 
  reminds me of that time when i had an american host family explaining to me the concept of supermarkets and shopping malls ... 
  yeah river bathing can always be full of nasty surprises , i prefer sticking to ( kinda ) stagnant water . 
   it is a dangerous place to swim may i ask why ? 
  fuck yeah , ratatouille is awesome !, 
  also moli\u00e8re and emile zola, 
  this guy drinks . 
  wait ... that came out weird . 
  you forgot probably the best one : [ patrick s\u00e9bastien - grazie mille ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdvw-hlrbbs ) basically a thank you to italy for the pizza and pasta . 
  wonderful . 
  still remains fairly popular now . 
  got ta get those `` g '' from deeeeep down there , make it so it sounds like you 're hacking from waaay down there . 
  i still ca n't get used to it . 
  i 've seen both tbh . 
  he 's up there but got a dirty rep since he was involved in the fifa scandals last year as well . 
  i still remember as if it was yesterday . 
  my mates and i were dumbfounded when we saw it happen , we thought we did n't see it correctly . 
  and then we lost the game . 
  and then we lost the competition . 
  many sad beers were had after that . 
  probably because all of us understand english . 
  i 'm pretty confident that tourists from bumfuck china have similar stupid questions . 
  we just ca n't understand them . 
  no , not really , only a fraction of the population eat it only for special occasions .

  it costs nothing and actually brings in money . 
  gays like fancy weddings too . 
   obviously , but we are talking about reasons based on which you vote for a party . 
  it 's good supplementary reason , but it should n't be the main guiding issue a party that wants to remove gay marriage in france would not be voted to power . 
  if people in poland would care about reducing discrimination , yeah it would matter because a new party would be formed that has the same ideology except the gay issue . 
  but polish dont care about reducing discrimination and inequality and that 's it . 
  they do not feel the need to change this aspect of their society , heck most think homosexuality is an abnormal act . 
  supply and demand . 
  if the supply for cheap workforce increases , then it only makes sense to reduce salaries , reduce worker conditions , make it easier to fire someone . 
  these things will lead to decreased social conditions and increased precarity . 
  you have a refugee that does not speak german and you put him or her on the same market as a german native . 
  you have to make it interesting for the employer to hire them . 
   yes there 's problems that should be fixed , but then again back to original point - there are far more important and pressing matters well the homosexual marriage problem ** can ** be fixed by your govt . 
  there 's nothing stopping them to get fixed . 
  if you allow gay marriage , it 's not like unemployment will go through the roof or that the deficit will increase or whatever . 
  it 's a big problem that takes 10 minutes to solve . 
  why are you making it seem like it 's really complicated to fix and other things ? 
   depends on country , in poland it 's not that much . 
  so because it 's not much , it 's okay to discriminate childless homosexual couples . 
  a little discrimination is okay . 
  it 's not much . 
  just a little . 
  it 's fine . 
  how about if you remove all tax breaks for all married people then ? 
   exactly the same thing as if you were as stright unmarried couple - get your will written * but those straight unmarried couples are unmarried * ** by choice ** , not because some bigots decided yeah you 're gay , you shouldnt get a right to this particular institution . 
  not having a marriage means there 's no divorce , there 's no splitting of common belongings in case of a `` divorce '' , it means precarity for one or the other . 
  it means that in the case the couple splits , one might not be able to see the children that they helped raise . 
  how does a will fix that ? 
   they 'll have to keep it low to keep us production down , so that 's not much of a choice . 
  besides , i believe some of the opec countries have started setting their own prices and now iran will be able to export oil too , wo n't it ? 
  oh god today i 'm so happy . 
  and how do you feel like ? 
  well people are what they choose to define themselves . 
  for me the default is she 's french because she is born and bred here . 
  if someone is born and bred in a different part of the world but they decide they love france and wan na move here and get all the rights and responsabilities . 
  then they 'll become french too . 
  but random person = / = people . 
  human rights are just for the liberals to worry about ? 
  good to know ... 
  what about tax breaks ? 
  married people usually pay smaller taxes than if together . 
  what happens in case of sidden death ? 
  what happens if there 's a will but the grandparents want the kids . 
  who do you give the kids to ? 
  some person there is no legal relation or the grand-parents ? 
  but if the war is over and the region is stable in 3 years what do you do ? 
  do you send them home ? 
  do you tell them okay guys you can stay because in 3 years people will be obviously integrated right ? 
  what exactly do you do ? 
  and the gist of what enders said was to reduce that minimum wage . 
  * or * you can create a two tier system , asylum seekers and normal citizens . 
  if person g gets paid 10 euros per hour and person s gets paid 5 euros for the same job , that is sure to foster social cohesion right ? 
  no one way person s would be unfairly treated . 
  so the solution is n't a two tier system , what 's good for the gander is good for the goose . 
  so what do you do now ? 
  you can give s jobs g would never want but at 2-3 million s , you got ta start inventing bs jobs to keep them working . 
  or you allow them to have the same rights to the job market as g . this will mean g will be fairly unhappy with how things are going and will drive salaries down . . 
  this is why neo-liberals are in favor of refugees . 
  they just see it as a means of cheap labor . 
  just because poland dismisses the human rights of a few people , that does n't make it a non-issue . 
  democracy =\\ = dictatorship of the majority . 
  i 'm grabbing my pop-corn because i 'll love to see how the extreme leftists juggle between a ) accepting more refugees and b ) salaries and conditions for workers being reduced in order to help the refugees . 
  i do n't know the political landscape in germany well enough but it 'll be interesting in france . 
  quoting :  `` we must have the courage for deregulation in the way that so far we know from the united states , ''  `` it is better to enter the labour market with mini-jobs or low-paid jobs than not at all and to be condemned to social security , doing nothing and frustration . '', 
  this seems to confirm a previous post about this crisis creating a downward pressure in the job market :  https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3pbno3/german_union_boss_warns_of_downward_pressure_on/, 
  so homosexual couples are recognized by the state or not ? 
   because of bad jobs , small salaries , etc as a we , i had the impression that the standard of living was increasing in poland , that wages are also higher than in other ee countries and that it 's doing fairly well economically . 
  how do samaries compare to 5 years ago - 10 years ago - 15 years ago ? 
  democracy =\\ = dictatorship of the majority . 
  can you read your comments and replace lgbt with jewish ? 
  thaaanks . 
  if you 're gay and raise a kid with your partner and die , the partner should be able to get the kid , not adopted by the state . 
  it 's basic human rights . 
   a survey from 2005 found 89 % of the population stating that they considered homosexuality an unnatural activity . 
  half believed homosexuality should be tolerated . 
  deeper problems are afoot in the polish society . 
  so they have to fight their own problems ** and ** politics to conceive ? 
  damn . 
  sorry for them : /, 
  \u252c \u2500 \u2500 \u252c \u25e1 \uff89 ( \u00b0 - \u00b0 \uff89 ) it 's okay man . 
  if one works toulon , evry lille thing cannes make you flip . 
  we 'll tours the tables back for you . 
  well one can be financially secure while working in the industry too . 
  it depends hugely on what your specialisation is . 
  i still think you underestimate the opportunities phd students have . 
  but at what point ? 
  do you need 7 subs ? 
  and the vast majority of phds dont end up getting a chair . 
  tis life . 
  they 're not stuck in their job and they can make serious money though . 
  unlike menial work . 
  i mean it 's a full time position but not a permanent position , like engineer or doc or whatever . 
  like i said , she 's french . 
  i dont get your point . 
  a post doc is n't a job . 
  just like a phd is n't a job . 
  it 's an intermediate position that 's only supposed to last about 2 years . 
  afterwards you start making more ( or much much more if you go into industry ) . 
  your comparison is n't valid imo . 
  people who work in academia do n't do it for the money , they can easily find higher paying jobs .

  aurelie filippetti despite being one of the mps most opposed to the hadopi , changed her mind overnight as she became minister of culture and she even appointed pierre lescure , ex ceo of canal + tv channel , as head of the newest and greatest commission in charge of defining the future of culture in france . 
  do you know who else worked at canal + ? 
  denis olivennes , the guy who came up with hadopi ... 
  he even got a nice 3.2 m $ layoff check thanks to a retroactive amendment his good friend pierre lescure added to his work contract , just before canal + was bought by vivendi . 
  collusion , favors between friends , all the decisions in french politics are made among a small group of corrupt people . 
  i do n't have very high hopes for improvement . 
  greece has already defaulted on [ more than 50 % ] ( http://www.economist.com/node/21550271 ) of its debt . 
  the `` lenders '' wo n't ever see their money but it wo n't prevent them from running what 's left of the economy to the ground , and the greek people with it . 
  representative democracy is aristocracy , pretty much . 
  either way many people are going to be fucked . 
  democracy is the tyranny of the majority . 
  considering the issues germany has had with gazprom in the past it seems a little strange they would let them increase their foothold in europe . 
  they do n't really have that much money at stake , it 's just electoralist acting . 
  greece is unlikely to ever be able to pay , anyway . 
  it is not clear at all what the deal actually is , the majority of orange 's 230 million clients are outside of france , they may have obtained an arrangement thanks to the dominant position of the group in some countries in africa and eastern europe . 
  i hope legislation will quickly be written on an european level for this issue , because a world where each website operator must make deals with the isps to have their content more or less well taken care of is not a world i want to live in . 
  the french constitutional council has already decided that access to the internet has constitutional protection , so there is hope . 
  the housing situation in france , especially paris is ridiculous , and our successive governments just ca n't stop pumping more money into the bubble . 
  they also conveniently forget this fact when comparing labor cost to other countries , like germany , where housing can be 3 or 4 times cheaper ... 
  as europe 's economic power fades , if we want to stay on top we will need other means to secure the resources we need : metals , oil and uranium . 
  the demand from china for these same resources increases daily , and they wo n't do us any favours . 
  it is a sad fact of the world that only force gets you respect . 
  we ca n't count on the good will of others for long-term survival . 
  it talks about children , but not necessarily about reproduction . 
  at the time this code was written , and for a very long time after , all children born inside marriage were considered legitimate . 
  that was a way to deal with adultery . 
  adopted children also enjoy the same status . 
  children born outside however marriage suffered from reduced rights . 
  now that has changed , and children have the same rights whatever their parent 's marital status is , so marriage is not a necessity for them . 
  i believe it is one of the reasons for this law . 
  what 's interesting about this is that our civil code does not actually say that marriage is between a man and a woman . 
  it merely uses the term `` spouses '' ( \u00e9poux ) . 
  the proposed law does not change this , but only alters other parts of the code where is made the assumption that the married are a man and a woman . 
  i think that trying to apply the same principles to manage a family budget and a country budget is stupid , yes , because the rules are not the same . 
  hollande 's `` war against the rich '' is a purely phantasmatic construction of some media . 
  the only anti-rich measure , the famous 75 % tax , was rejected by the constitutional council . 
  he did not `` hit the businesses '' either . 
  there was a proposal to raise business taxes , but they only had to raise their voice a little for hollande to bend to their demands and shelve the idea . 
  lastly the imf has just published [ a study ] ( http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-01-04/imf-officials-we-were-wrong-about-austerity.html ) that shows that the economic models used to justify austerity underestimated its economic impact by a factor of 3 . 
  so i 'm not sure that 's a good idea . 
   the social security system is in deficit i never quite bought the rhetoric we hear constantly about this deficit . 
  of course there 's a deficit , it costs money to treat and take care of sick people . 
  we never hear about the deficit of the police , or the deficit of schools . 
  all these services cost money and we pay taxes to cover it globally ( or should ) . 
  i do n't know much about common law , but under french law there is the concept of implicit , non-verbal contracts , usually buying in shops falls under this idea . 
  a sale is considered final when there is agreement on the `` thing '' , and on the `` price '' . 
  the price is displayed besides the item ( it is a legal requirement , with a few exceptions for jewelry and such ) , so only the `` thing '' must be determined , and since the seller can not refuse to sell , only the buyer can settle the sale . 
  it is a bit controversial as to when exactly this happens , usually somewhere near the cash register , and certainly before the shop 's door , 
  it 's slightly more complicated than that . 
  sellers are obliged to accept money only if you can provide the exact amount . 
  so they can refuse your 100 $ bill if the amount you have to pay is lower . 
  so , how about that 1 $ note ? 
  lol ... 
  meanwhile in france voters must register before the 31st december of the year preceding the elections , and political ads are entirely banned except during allocated time slots before the elections . 
  considering his track record with regard to his electoral promises , i wo n't get my hopes up for this one . 
  sometimes i watch the turkish tv channels on iptv and it is so similar to some of our french ones that if i turned the sound off i could barely tell the difference . 
  maybe it is because these channels are intended for expatriates , but i 'm thinking maybe our cultures are n't that different . 
  so why not ? 
  edit : assuming they fix all their issues including cyprus , religion , and human rights , of course . 
   so , what is ( or should be ) the purpose of a society ? 
  i think we will agree on at least two points : stability , and wealth . 
  actually the purpose of a society is security . 
  it takes several forms : protection against natural forces , predators and other enemy societies , food security and shelter . 
  to operate , a society needs cooperation , through which more can be achieved than by individuals alone . 
  like you mentioned this is similar to the prisoner 's dilemma . 
  what the free market does is reintroduce inside the society the competition that society intended to protect individuals from . 
  in the free market , actors need to play dirty to win the prisoner 's game . 
  we can learn from game theory here : game theory has proven that overall the gain is higher if individuals cooperate , however the individual gain is higher for the traitor * if * people encounter each other rarely . 
  as the size of our societies increase , the winning strategy becomes increasingly to betray your fellow . 
  however will it ever change ? 
  as a frenchman i 'm not very optimistic . 
  our history shows that people in their majority do n't mind being ruled and used by a small aristocracy . 
  french revolution was not started because of oppression , but because of famine , and when things stabilized , people accepted a new king , or a new emperor , and today it would be foolish to think it is any different . 
  as long as their society gives them security , most people will be content . 
  and what happens the next time you go see your doctor if you did n't give him a gift last time ? 
  most doctors will do their job but maybe a few wo n't be as motivated . 
  this kind of practice seems akin to corruption and should be outlawed . 
  can someone explain why a 28m $ vs 50m $ loan makes such a difference for a 1 billion $ contract ? 
  you ca n't have a culture without a language to express it . 
  the two are intimately linked in their evolution . 
  it 's great to be able to import new words into our language , but when we 're using english words in place of perfectly good french words , we 're causing damage . 
  zola translated to english is not zola . 
  from a business logic it makes sense to fire employees who become sick . 
  from a public finances logic it makes sense to kill children with a handicap , or people with untreatable cancer . 
  that 's just cheaper . 
  fortunately some people believe that money is not the sole reason to justify everything . 
  overfishing on this scale is a crime against the future . 
  it 's pretty incredible to realize that a once extremely common fish like the atlantic cod is now classified as a vulnerable species . 
  the consequences if we go on like this might be dire . 
  like our beloved king louis xiv said : `` after me , the deluge '' . 
  i did n't vote sarkozy nor hollande , nor any of the elected presidents since i had the right to vote , so i still do n't feel responsible . 
  like you guessed i usually vote for the green party , however i get discouraged by their constant internal fights and pettiness . 
  you ca n't just make the shortcut to say `` a voted for b , and b supports position x , therefore a supports x '' . 
  a candidate has a lot of opinions , and people who vote for them do n't necessarily agree on every single one of them . 
  voting is the process of finding the candidate that is the `` less far '' from your opinions , that 's the wonder of democracy . 
  however unfortunately french people in general have reactionary opinions , and are not particularly in favor of fairness as long as they get the best end of the deal , despite what the motto of our republic says . 
  you only have to see the ~ 100k people marching the streets to protest gay marriage only a few days ago to convince yourself ( if you needed to ) . 
  i have little hope to see it ever change . 
  there is a big difference between making a law to prevent people from injuring/killing themselves , and a law to prevent people from injuring/killing * others * . 
   but while banks would be permitted to ask their clients to hand over self-declarations attesting that they had paid the appropriate taxes , the government stressed there would be no obligation for clients to file them .

  so we can say that marx was in favor of violent rebellions . 
  ( ca n't really convince people to give up what they have , without threats ) . 
  i ca n't believe someone would produce such a retarded comparison . 
  one guy for good or bad , incompetence or not brought a ton of new knowledge to the world . 
  the other was just a king with a private domain . 
  compare leopold ii with isabela i if you want . 
  it would make for a less ridiculous claim . 
   hiroshima not to criticise your comment , but do you have any hiroshima memorials in spain ? 
  i wonder how many there are in the us . 
  how about scrapping everything and putting just a list of facts people can read about ? 
  [ yes ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/79/us_%2420_series_2006_obverse.jpg/1280px-us_%2420_series_2006_obverse.jpg ), 
   indian engineer working for peanuts will take your job depends on the type of job you 're having . 
  if you 're working on critical systems that can not be easily outsourced without risking leaks of your code base , knowhow etc. 
  then you 'll have a safe job that 'll last you for a long long time . 
   celebrating the results of protectionism to me go read how yahoo was scanning emails for the us govt !, 
  you simply refuse the perfectly clear point / u/mrzakalwe is making . 
  he 'd rather be poorer in the next 30 years but have an uncertain future , than be richer in the next 30 years but have an uncertain future . 
  that makes perfect sense to me !, 
  guy hates money . 
   in this case unless you have a gift for prophesy , time will tell or if you listen to the experts , everybody will be poorer . 
  http://www.igmchicago.org/igm-economic-experts-panel/poll-results?surveyid=sv_429ihjqvpbv1cnb congrats uk , you won the stupid lottery . 
  yeah . 
  right ear did n't work . 
  try to play around with the jack . 
  i notice bills tend to have names that are the opposite of what they actually strive to achieve : * patriot act * the internet freedom act * clear skies act and quite a few more . 
  hey ... you can enjoy his art even though he 's a jackass . 
  just pirate it , 
  kassovitz is a 9/11 truther so it 's no secret he 's a shitbag . 
   no we really do n't . 
  did you go check the poll that i already sent you ? 
   without knowing what the outcome of the negotiations will be yeah it 'll be really mitigated if uk remains in the eea i.e. 
  being in the eu without any veto vote . 
  that sound very smart . 
  and looking at the rhetoric presented so far , it 's pretty clear that some actually want a hard brexit which is dumb . 
   for example , you 'd be hard pressed to find a majority in the uk who would exchange say the nhs for a 1 % boost in gdp you having the nhs ** has ** an impact on gdp . 
  immigrants ** have ** an impact on gdp , [ a positive one ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/nov/05/eu-migrants-uk-gains-20bn-ucl-study ) . 
  friggin `` self determination '' has no real impact on gdp because it 's just plain words . 
  it 's a hollow concept anyone can fill it up with whatever fantasies they have . 
   who would want to exchange a reversion to monarchy for a 1 % rise in gdp no one would want that because that 's ** bullshit ** . 
  there is no economic leaver that a monarchy would have to produce higher gdp . 
  you are inventing stuff . 
   its not all about the economy , there are societal political and other aspects too . . no ... it 's bullshit . 
  the arguments you are giving about `` self-determination '' and whatever crap are bullshit . 
  you create this imaginary all powerful being called the eu then you rebel against it because it has waay too much power . 
  no , the eu does n't impede on uk self determination . 
   i do n't think we 'll see any significant economic harm either way , and quite a lot of potential . 
  no significant economic harm , just that people will be poorer because of bullshit . 
  you put yourself in the situation where you console yourself with the fact that `` hey guys , it wo n't be ** that ** bad '' . 
  which in my opinion is stupid but hey , if you think that 's awesome , more power to you . 
  cheers . 
  we should test that theory by posting a bs article that would n't get any upvotes normally . 
   they do , but that 's taking one point in isolation ( the economic aspect . . ) well of course . 
  is that not the most important aspect about the brexit ? 
  you can argue till the cows come home if politically it 's useful of not , but economically we already know what 's the most likely outcome : everybody will be poorer . 
   but hey , some things that some people think are important will be different . 
  hey we got the message , you 'd rather be poorer and not `` depend on brussels '' . 
  whatever that bullshit means . 
  when people let politics determine how much money they get in the end , something is just off . 
   it 'll get worse , but not drastically so what i 'm confused about is why ? 
  why make yourself and others poorer ? 
  it 's a bit like checking your weather outside during a few days and concluding climate change is happening ( or not ) . 
  there are way to many unknowns to figure out the exact long term effects of brexit . 
  but economists vastly agree that brexit will make uk and eu citizens poorer . 
  http://www.igmchicago.org/igm-economic-experts-panel/poll-results?surveyid=sv_429ihjqvpbv1cnb they vastly agree on this topic . 
  so yeah , brexit was dumb . 
   also there are probably more brits on r/the _ donald than americans .

   america is not a ` white nation ' nor was it ever supposed to be one eh , benji franklin would like to have a word with you :  that the number of purely white people in the world is proportionably very small . 
  all africa is black or tawny . 
  america ( exclusive of the new comers ) wholly so . 
  and in europe , the spaniards , italians , french , russians and swedes , are generally of what we call a swarthy complexion ; as are the germans also , the saxons only excepted , who with the english , make the principal body of white people on the face of the earth . 
  i could wish their numbers were increased . 
  and while we are , as i may call it , scouring our planet , by clearing america of woods , and so making this side of our globe reflect a brighter light to the eyes of inhabitants in mars or venus , why should we in the sight of superior beings , darken its people ? 
  why increase the sons of africa , by planting them in america , where we have so fair an opportunity , by excluding all blacks and tawneys , of increasing the lovely white and red ? 
  but perhaps i am partial to the complexion of my country , for such kind of partiality is natural to mankind . 
  not to mention the way elections and power was organised from the beginning with the senat that had a lot of power and where the positions were occupied by white males . 
  claiming that the founding fathers did n't want the us to remain organised around white males is very sketchy . 
   all 9 attackers were eu citizens .

   none of the paris attackers were actual refugees .

very , very bad article . 
  what is currently happening is that the government is quietly letting go of its plans to reduce nuclear power , which it had adopted a few years ago for electoral reasons as it was allied with an ecologist party . 
  the whole plan was silly , the ecologists have thoroughly self destroyed now , and the tilting is towards * not * phasing out nuclear . 
  huh ? 
  that definition works if you 're either a fundamentalist or vehemently anti-religion ( an atheist fundamentalist i.guess ) yourself , but most people participating in religions are not . 
  and it 's not even religion taken at face value , it 's just one very limited understanding of religion - or perhaps it is religion minus understanding ? 
  some believe in free speech , some do n't . 
  yes religious muslims may tend to be more socially conservative than the current average non-muslim european , though moderate muslim positions are very similar to mainstream catholic doctrine , which not long ago was n't considered incompatible with european values . 
  i agree it would be sad to go backward to religious conservative values , be they catholic or muslim - it 's important to keep religions at bay - and respect for secular values is perfectly compatible with islam . 
  being tolerant in no way contradicts being muslim . 
  wrong . 
  former muslims in europe are not executed , nor are they in most muslim countries , backward as they may be . 
  you ca n't just take whatever sentence from the qur ` an , spin your interpretation , and declare it is universal . 
  in any case , freedom of religion is a core european value , and if someone wants to follow islam it is their right . 
  islam does n't clash with secularism and you are ignoring the many muslim citizens who live , work , and participate in society here . 
  it is true that the fundamentalist disease affects islam more than christianity today , but accusing all muslims because some of them are radicals is just wrong . 
   already the case in france for ages . 
  are you sure ? 
  the french labour regulation is extremely complex and convoluted but from http://www.infoprudhommes.fr/node/516 it seems such time is explicitly excluded ( though if it exceeds the time it would take to go to the company the excess is compensated , while not counting as working time at least for some purposes . 
  exceptions may apply . 
  subject to case law and additional interpretations . ), 
  or , more likely , `` employers will promptly get rid of employees living far from where they work '', 
  so you 're seriously saying saudia arabia is planning for - nay , embarked on already , the genocide of shia muslims . 
  agreed on the economics of it , but what i was wondering is the legal status : where does that decision come from and how to undo it , through legislative or judicial process ? 
  still nothing to do with an eradication plan . 
  i like the idea , a few brothels would be nice . 
  got ta give them a call so they can adjust their plans . 
  i seriously doubt that . 
  is there any evidence of such actions ? 
  that they fight by proxy against shia states and milicias is one thing , but to extrapolate from that a plan to eradicate shias seems at best very speculative . 
  what do you mean , are you saying saudi arabia 's goal is to physically eliminate all shia muslims ? 
  or to forcibly convert them to sunni islam ? 
  i doubt shia muslims will frequent a wahhabi mosque . 
  crazy and very destructive decision , could cost many thousand jobs and at the very least huge aggravation for those working from home , especially in countries with strict hourly wage and working hours regulations - in france it would be a nightmare . 
  is there a possible appeal ? 
  does this reflect a bad law that needs to be changed urgently or is it just a bad decision ? 
  perhaps , foreign workers come under temporary contracts and must leave at the end of their job , and i 'm sure they do n't hesitate to put someone on a plane back home if they overstay . 
  interesting , i thought they were an equal-opportunity mistreater of foreign workers . 
  do n't they get lots of pakistani muslims ? 
  indeed that 's a concern . 
  not just their religious conflicts either , that region hosts many conflicts , religion is just part of it . 
  heh , you should n't have conquered the roman empire  but no , europe is n't about christiandom , though of course it 's a huge cultural influence . 
  but there are tens of millions of muslims among european citizens - as well other religions , and lots of people unaffiliated to any religion . 
  sure , i was only objecting to the generalisation . 
  intersting how stating such an obvious fact about islam in europe brings the downvotes . 
  it 's not a new thing , it started in the 70s . 
  they 're not trying to spread muslims among non muslims , but to spread their version of islam everywhere muslims are . 
  there are close to 2 bn muslims in the world , they 're not going to bring them in - financing mosques and other institutions abroad is much more effective . 
  that 's silly , islam is part of europe too . 
  it 's not to spread islam , but to spread fundamentalism among muslims . 
  i 'll still have fried eggs and crispy bacon with a cooked tomato and perhaps some black sausage any day . 
  beans optional though . 
   that you will house in certain parts of the country , thus ghettoisation . 
  not necessarily . 
  the best way is probably to house small numbers in a large number of cities including small ones . 
  usually works well for integration . 
   you just need a few nuts to ruin everything . 
  yeah we need to deal with the nuts and spit them out somehow , the vast majority of migrants ( refugees or not ) are probably regular people trying to make a life for themselves and their family , but obviously some are trouble . 
  so now you 've stopped screaming incoherently and switched to condescension . 
  how nice of you . 
  wahhabi mosques , just what we need . 
  yeah well i m probably lying and stupid , no point discussing this with you . 
   i dont agree that the whole europe should be responsible for insane immigratin politics of germany and sweden . 
  i would n't call german policy crazy , it is pragmatic and reasonable in my view - sweden is another matter and they 'll have to change . 
  but this is the point of a global solution . 
  we can not have a system where some country offers permanent residency to anyone showing up from syria and asks others to keep them from entering , it 's just crazy - if sweden wants to do that it should arrange direct flights from greece or even turkey to back its offer , or at least ask other countries such as denmark to let them through . 
  different countries can have different policies but these must be coordinated sensibly , and some combinations , such as the current one , are just unviable . 
  as to the moral and legal duty it concerns refugees and asylum seekers , not all migrants - and it does not come from the eu but from un conventions . 
  but all countries in europe need to tackle this issue jointly , not as a battle of national interests or preferences - sweden must adapt and other countries too . 
  as part of such a solution , the burden of handling asylum applications should be shared , though mandatory quotas based on a mathematical formula are probably not the way to do it . 
  you 're talking about permanent quotas scaled up from existing proposals , not the current plan then . 
  i do n't think this makes sense , europe needs to come up with an actual sensible policy , not just a repartition formula . 
  but to get there we need to consider the issue globally , not on a narrow national basis . 
  the commission unfortunately is losing its credibility as a key source of proposals and facilitation towards a solution , dublin is dead , and there 's no common policy . 
  well i do n't see how or why others would go to that length , nor why any country would decide to leave the union rather than accept a few thousand refugees . 
  this is being blown out of proportion - yes it 's an important issue , and yes europe 's response so far ( including the current plan ) is inadequate and a sensible policy is needed , but until such is proposed and agreed we 'll all have to live with the temporary measures designed to deal with immediate issues . 
  no `` they '' could n't , such legislation would change treaties and require approval of all , not just majority . 
  juncker is not that relevant though , and this charade of a state of the union address is pretty silly . 
  my bet is , not much will come of it . 
  like the cice it will end with a big complex machinery with little effect . 
  mostly he is breaking a taboo and laying the ground for real reform by his successor . 
  that 's also 81 years after the death of marc-antoine charpentier . 
  what 's your point ? 
  the high points of british cuisine are breakfast and tea though . 
  thankfully the brits know it and have plenty of indian/french/italian / ... restaurants to chose from . 
  what is this about though , a nonbinding resolution by the general assembly ? 
  if so , even if it did pass it would have no effect , a declaration does n't change laws . 
  this is a danger but only if they are subsidized to switch , which can lead to overproduction for organic food just the same as for any product . 
  what would be the purpose of annexing lichtenstein , who would want to do it , and why would other countries tolerate it ? 
  lacking a purpose , a motive , and means to do it successfully , it 's hard to see this happening . 
  it is precisely this strategy of trying to plan production instead of letting agricultural entrepreneurs work it out that leads to the current problems . 
  it results in a less efficient agriculture that struggles to adapt to changing market conditions , because a bureaucratic plan is needed each time some aspect needs to adapt . 
  small farms can compete with big ones when and where they offer additional value - which they do , as a complement to large farms . 
  they definitely have their place in a market based agriculture . 
  if there 's too much milk production in europe , some production capacity needs to close - and a good way to do that is indeed for the less profitable farms to be shut down / converted to more useful purposes . 
  and wine too , 
  fair enough , i guess that 's what we disagree on then . 
  oh well , i thought you were saying this is a valid argument . 
   which is pretty valid considering that the region macedonia is shared between the two country and none can appropriate it as a state name , only internally the only reason none can appropriate it is if both claim it . 
  which is n't the case here .

  they 've been avoiding and defrauding taxes for a very long time with their old `` i do n't want to pay any taxes or leave the country '' ) . 
  it 's time they pay a bit back to society what they owe . 
   launch the tender process for the issuing of 4g and 5g licences . 
  that 's always fresh cash in the register and will help push new technologies on the market (  growth ) , good idea ; 100 % agreed oh also the document is longer this time ; so ; :  on garnishments , adopt legislation to eliminate the 25 percent ceiling on wages and pensions ... i do n't have precise data here but please be careful ; that one can really , * really * hurt a very large part of the population . 
  a lot of people are late on their mortgages or debts . 
  if you collect all their income , you will risk enormous social unstability . 
  try telling a big part of the population that their next 10 paychecks does n't exist because it 's the late mortgage payment , but they have to keep working `` for free '' so that the bank collects all their money . 
  that would be bad . 
   `` while ensuring reasonable living conditions '' please define `` while ensuring reasonable living conditions '' precisely . 
  that 's what the 25 % are supposed to be . 
  and we are talking about removing it . 
  lots of people are already earning 600e/month . 
  if you leave them 200 $ / mo and collect all the rest ; they 'll go crazy . 
  and if you collect on accounts without limits either , it could also cause a catastrophic bank run : if you tell the population you will empty their accounts entirely , they 'll all run to empty it before that happen . 
  cyprus avoided it by the skin of their teeth by setting * an haircut * of a few % . 
  do we really want to do it without a well defined limit ? 
  that 25 % limit exist for a very good reason imho . 
  relevant : http://uk.businessinsider.com/70-of-greek-mortgages-arent-being-paid-2015-6?r=us i know this would make the troika/creditors scream , but i 'd suggest putting a floor of takehome 1000 $ / mo on the collectable part of income ( basically , anything they earn below 1000 $ ca n't be collected . 
  above could be within a certain agreed limit set in the document of course ) . 
  another possible help mesure could be a temporary moratorium on private citizen debts ( without interests ) ( by debts i intend the big crippling ones like mortgage on the home you live in , on the car you use to go to work , etc ) within defined criterias . 
  not appliable to corporations and companies more than 3 individuals ( bigger than family ) of course . ), 
  or making more than xxx euros a year . 
  it would probably be realistic right now to prevent stalling the economy and everyone to declare bankruptcy . 
  people ca n't pay debts honestly if they ca n't pay the utilities or other bills in time first . 
  and according to that : http://greece.greekreporter.com/2014/09/25/6-3-million-greeks-threatened-by-poverty/ it means about 60 % of the population is * already * threathened by potential poverty currently . 
  please think about how much you are personally earning , and how much money you 'd left the average greek to survive ( oh and for the `` not my debts , not my problem '' , well if greece default or explode in a maidan-like-but-bloodier revolution it 'll partly be your problem too so ... : / / sorry to be blunt but it 's not that far away either if syriza fails in the population 's eyes . 
  syriza was already elected by saying they would change radically everything . 
  and greeks citizens already think they ai n't radical and strong enough in their change . ), 
  hear me out , i know i 'm making a lot of that point , but if people have `` debts '' , it means they do n't have the money to pay those immediately . 
  if they had it , they 'd not have debts . 
  starting to cease everything they have left is probably not a good idea . 
  let 's not push the population too far on that point , please ? 
   improve tax debt write-off rules [ to be specified ] ; another very important bit to specify i think \\ ^ \\ ^ ''  \u2022 combat fuel smuggling , via legislative measures for locating storage tanks ( fixed or mobile ) ; sorry to complain again , but should n't those police ressources be better allocated against human traficking ( e.g : of immigrants ) ? 
   \u2022 produce a plan whereby the sgpr intensifiesfight to tax evasion and undeclared deposits , by checking bank transactions in banking institutions in greece or abroad , with a view to recover unpaid taxes ; definitely agreed , time to track better the big cash flows leaving or entering the country . 
  there 's probably a few billions of euros recoverable there . 
  it should be a major priority attached to fighting tax evasion/fraud . 
   mendments to the household insolvency law to introduce a mechanism to separate strategic defaulters from good faith debtors as well as simplify and strengthen the procedures and introduce measures to address the large backlog of cases ; 100 % agreed ; processing a default on debts for lack of proper ressources is n't an excuse for fraud . 
   ( i ) reduce red tape , including on horizontal licensing requirements of investments and on low-risk activities as recommended by the world bank very much needed too . 
  there is way too much administrative red tape in greece . 
  another important point where greece has serious work to do . 
  i think you meant `` 189 % '' . 
  ( it 's probably around 60 % in reality ; and that 's pretty much due to the state run propaganda cult of personnality constantly painting him as a russian superhero on tv . 
  without it 'd be half that . ), 
   the distilleries buy at a fixed price regardless of where it came or how much it cost ( assuming ofc same quality ) . 
  if they ca n't find enough to sell it at that price they 'll be forced to pay higher ones to keep running and selling sufficient volume . 
   no , because we are competing against spain and italy , who have to make those come from way further away than greece . 
  i also doubt that their prices are lower than greece . 
  they also have further taxes and frequently higher wages and their own economic difficulties that might incitate them to make prices higher sooner or later regardless . 
   and even if there is a price increase , the mainland farmers will benefit more . 
  so what ? 
  is it illegal to have be less impoverished in one place than another ? 
   those subsidies exist in order to guide a country to produce that thing and stop producing the other thing . 
  incentives . 
  those subsidies are there to ensure we do n't loose food production capacities , should we find ourselves unable to import enough food in europe . 
  as long as greece remains in the eu , the agro subsidies will keep flowing one way or another . 
   $ 1100/year in my pa 's case which are 1100 $ that the greek gov would not be able to find out , and that much less money cycling the already starved economy x tens of thousands of farmer , putting further stress on the system . 
  and this is just one of a very large number of subsidies that would risk vanish . 
  i 'm not saying there would n't be some people trying to get the eu to help greece , but the situation would be a lot harder . 
  just because there are contingences and backup plans ( that probably involve screwin germany of a lot of money : x ) in case of catastrophe or grexit does not mean staying in the eurozone ( ... not at all costs , for the moment , ok ) would n't be somewhat better . 
   if they payed the same vat with the mainland olive growers , they would n't be able to compete . 
  is this really about competition ? 
  i mean , there is a volume of demand , and they are part of the supply . 
  people are n't going suddenly to stop eating olive based products . 
  however it might means prices will rise a bit . 
  tho since it 's food , the customers should be able to benefit from the lowered food-related vat so they 'll ( in practice ) loose little . 
   that 's why the existence of a lower vat is a necessity for islands . 
  there are a lot of need , but `` not getting kicked out of the eu '' is probably more beneficial to said farmers . 
  yes they will make less money . 
  but this is probably one of the lowest priority right now with that kind of debt disaster . 
  please remind me how much money they get from farming related subsidies ? 
  if greece is kicked out , they loose all that too . 
  you know there has to be cuts somewhere and the imf is obsessed with the vat : /, 
  what about the fact that the local island farmer has an economical advantage next to imports because he does n't have to transport far to sell to locals ; unlike supermarkets & so on ? 
  sorry , i did n't meant the definition , i tackled a bit the point . 
  it 's just me but i think we could expand it a bit to common basic groceries simply speaking ; that does n't seem abusive to me . 
  stuff like washing machine powder , shampoo , etc. 
  the gov would have to maintain a `` chargemaster '' list of what is eligible , off course . 
  i saw the leaked counter proposals ; well :  and a reduced 13 percent rate for unprocessed food `` unprocessed '' ? 
  edit : sorry , i did n't meant the definition , i tackled a bit the point . 
  it 's just me but i think we could expand it a bit to common basic groceries simply speaking ; that does n't seem abusive to me . 
  stuff like washing machine powder , shampoo , etc. 
  the gov would have to maintain a `` chargemaster '' list of what is eligible , off course . 
   and ( iii ) eliminate discounts , including on islands unpopular but definitely needed , i agree  reduction in the expenditure ceiling for military spending by $ 400 million with a targeted set of actions [ added by troika ? 
  including a reduction in headcount and procurement ] . 
  the reduction in headcount will prove troublesome . 
  i 'm note sure that one is possible honestly ( making ex soldiers without a job and with no alternate gov-sponsored job offer during a difficult economic climate ? 
  could be asking for trouble :\\ \\ ) . 
  however i 'm sure they can find the $ 400m reduction and complete it with other cuts in the defense spending ( amongst other things by suspending military foreign procurations ) . 
  they could also offer the `` surplus '' military hand `` reclassification '' ( civil service ) to save on hirings on other jobs ( construction comes to mind amongst other things . 
  ie stop hiring partly construction crews and re assign vets there , the gov should n't want them out of sight to be honest )  gradually phase out the solidarity grant ( ekas ) for all pensioners by end-december 2017 ugh . 
  i take it it is related to that one ? 
  http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/observatories/eurwork/articles/other/government-grants-social-solidarity-aid-to-vulnerable-groups pensioners ca n't be in financial difficulties now ? 
  : / that point 's a bit creepy sorry . 
  otherwise i guess there 's no real choice on the rest . 
  i do n't know what tsipras reaction will be but i understand this is mostly about as good as greece will get . 
   usually in the human trafficking racket , too . 
  and that that should be jail automatically . 
  there 's definitely work to be done on that side ( cracking down on human traficking networks ) ; especially in eastern europe i believe ? 
  the problem is generally dealers are `` just '' users who buys more for people around them to sale to buy more for themselves . 
  basically they are addicts too exploited by the problem .

  i would be okey with germany too i guess . 
  i feel like we have extremely different mentalities . 
  it would not be a happy marriage . 
  we are better as somewhat friendly separate nations . 
  that makes sense , thank you for these insight . 
  you totally convinced me to vote le pen . 
  thanks for opening my eyes . 
  sure but it wo n't take as much steam if no traditional media picks it up . 
  also this kind of rumour mongering can not be stopped by any amount of reason . 
  the only thing that can be done is not propagating them . 
  haha and that 's not your case , right ? 
  if we are going for ridiculous associations then i definitly prefer merkel ruling my country to putin ruling my country , yes . 
  `` i would not like walking the kilometers of dick she had . '', 
  another proof that fn is not worthy of ruling my country . 
  i do n't like him but i am so voting for macron tomorrow . 
  except social medias only go so far . 
  stories generally pick up steam when the regular medias pick it up . 
  it 's totally okey to not do it though . 
  my gf hates it and all her colleagues know that she prefers handshake and respect that . 
  i 'll tell you on monday . 
  if she loses with a mediocre score i expect her to be crucified by her party . 
  she is already far from making unanimity right now and a lot of fn voters are already pissed off about her piss poor performance during the debate . 
  macron recently said in a speech that he was worried about the fact he saw fn voters everywhere in the country and on social medias etc. . . marine tried to poke fun at that during the debate by turning it into an ominous thing and parroting macron 's words to ridiculize him . 
  she ended up being ridicule herself but that marine for you . 
  luxembourg , the goal would be to get our tax money back . 
  depends on the level of education . 
  the lower you go , the less liked germany is . 
  but as a whole i would say germany is pretty well liked . 
  the problem are populists like le pen like to paint eu as an organization controlled by germany to exploit its trade partners . 
  if you are well-educated and informed you just ignore it because you know it 's bullshit but if you are a less educated person with one of those industrial jobs that may relocate to a country with a looser labour code at any time you may be tempted to believe anything . 
  there are many post that could be called that on reddit , do you comment on all of them or do you generally just ignore them ? 
  it 's mainly that there are rednecks pretty much everywhere . 
  they differ in style or slang but in the end they are all rednecks . 
  yes , c\u00e9dille is used to turn a hard `` c '' that you would pronunce `` k '' and make it a soft one pronunced `` ss '' for those who do n't know . 
  alcohol is an acquired taste , few people enjoy it the first time . 
  good on you for not drinking though . 
  religion and school is just a big no-no in france , call this cultural if you need . 
  school in france is thought as a place where students are allowed to be free from religion . 
  france is kind of extreme when it comes to secularism in general but when it comes to school you can think of france as a berzerking mother wolf . 
  there are historical reasons for that but it is just very deeply set in our culture . 
  that would be absolutly illegal . 
  religion has absolutly no place in school . 
  any head of a school allowing that to happen would be crucified . 
  some of them are really good though . 
  the netherlands legalized weed , nothing stops people from buying it there and taking it to a country that did not . 
  should eu rule that the netherlands have no right to legalize weeds to avoid that ? 
  doing that is already illegal . 
  i do n't like it at all . 
  it antagonizes some countries needlessly and i do n't think eu should be the one deciding gun laws . 
  got a friend who lived for years in south america . 
  less than an hour and a half delay is not worth texting anyone . 
  even according to french standards it 's crazy . 
  why are children driving tanks ? 
  this is quite confusing . 
  you may be overstating a bit . 
  she said she would make a referendum before exiting eu . 
  it is not sure at all that she would win it . 
  if she wins her referendum though the consequences may be bad yeah . 
  sure , i was not excluding the fact that some country do not invest as much in public cleaning or sometimes invest in an inefficient way . 
  i was just saying that , in absolute , if you are a country in southern europe ( not belgium then ) it is generally more costly to keep the streets at the same level of cleanliness . 
  katjusha in russian . 
  i have basic notions of russian from studying it a bit in university but i am nowhere near conversational . 
  i still remember the first verse of kajusha by heart though but i only remember vaguely what it means . 
  something we could do that could be pretty cool : social askeurope . 
  i think we are starting to have a nice community and i often think `` hey how cool would it be to have a pint with this guy ? '' . 
  my idea would be that we make some kind of permanent topic ( maybe put it in sidebar ? ), 
  where people who want to put their city and country ( nothing else ) . 
  this way if one of us is going to travel somewhere in europe , he or she can look up the permanent topic to see if there is someone there , contact them through reddit and have a drink or show them the city . 
  yes , we absolutly do !, 
  yeah i understand it now but it 's always hard to tell on internet . 
  i pretty much never downvote anyone . 
   french : met very few as their non speak english ways keeps them all in their own sphere of language . 
  french servers and the like . 
  have met 3 i think that spoke english . 
  i have probably met more but they wrote english so you ca n't tell . 
  super rare to meet . 
  yeah that 's a point that probably gets overlooked . 
  i play a lot of games with other europeans but unless i tell you you would probably never know where i am from . 
  that 's the problem for most people in this topic : the people you know to be from a certain country for sure are generally the ones that do n't speak english and those tend to be the ignorant , young and / or uneducated . 
  you did though so no need to downvote . 
  that 's what discussions are about . 
  it 's harder to keep streets clean under drier climates . 
  where it rains frequently the streets kind of keep themselves clean , you just need a few crews to pick up what remains and you are good . 
  in the south where it does not rain a lot it 's not as easy and keeping the streets clean is much much more work . 
  haha . 
  this is a clich\u00e9 though . 
  my family is from corsica and no one really hates the continentals . 
  they hate idiots who come to corsica and behave like jerks because they think they own the place . 
  you can go to corsica and be extremely well received . 
  start littering or trespassing on private property though and see what happens . 
  some people may see them as unfriendly because they do n't bow down and kiss the ass of tourists just because they bring money like you can see elsewhere and will tell you openly if you are being a jerk but if you are nice and respectful they can be very welcoming and nice . 
  hahaha . 
  i actually laughed out loud . 
  * le front r\u00e9publicain ( `` the republican front '' ) : it is an annoying catchphrase you hear a lot whenever the fn gets to second round of the election . 
  it is basically a call for people of all `` republican '' parties ( aka non fascist parties ) , regardless of political colour , to unite behind the candidate facing le pen , whoever it is , in second round to bar the fn from ever getting to power . 
  * various references to gaullism : pretty much everyone and their mother claims to be the rightful ideological descendant of de gaulle . 
  what does it mean ? 
  no one really knows anymore but that sure sounds good in speeches . 
  * le vote utile ( `` the useful vote '' ) : another annoying catchphrase . 
  it basically means that you should flock to the biggest party closest to your values instead of voting for small candidates that stand little chance of getting to second round .

  so like i said , take things with a pinch of salt . 
   one dude repeatedly kicks one of the protesters in the head whilst she 's on the floor . 
  that is not normal and i do not condone any violence . 
  they were beaten up also by the extreme right . 
  so no . 
  it 's not normal but that also doesnt mean the dudes there met to beat up women or to talk about beating up women . 
  they said , hey dont beat you woman , which is an important message . 
  college students are taught that it 's not okay to have sex with drunk chicks and they should ask for permission before sex . 
  sometimes it 's important to remember people basic things . 
  do you disagree ? 
  malcolm x was an idiot , but that does n't mean blacks in the us were n't discriminated against . 
  just because some nitwits make dumb calls , does n't mean a state of palestine is a bad decision or the colonisation of the west bank by israel is awesome . 
  you are confusing your problems . 
   as a jew , i ca n't say i feel particularly welcome in malm\u00f6 now . 
  you know , i 'll bet 10 euros that the speakers at the conference did n't know that some nutjobs will do that chant . 
  and hey it 's not like raoul wallenberg lost his life trying to save several tens of thousands of jews during ww2 . 
  edit : also the chants seem arabic . 
  are you blaming the swedish mps for not speaking arabic ? 
  we were talking about how turkey is not a european country . 
  how this diverted to a talk about romania beats me . 
   `` fuckin skinheads burned this shit down . '', 
  how do you know ? 
  you have to consider how dangerous it is to cook golumpki . 
  some butterfingers might have burnt down the kitchen . 
  wtf are you talking about ? 
   you 're engaging in propaganda when you 're telling us some right-wingers torched that place . 
  far be it from me to ever think that . 
  i have not stated anything of the sorts . 
  i honestly think that far right groups from western europe love eastern europeans and if for not this refugee problem , ees would be welcome by them as fellow europeans . 
  am i wrong ? 
  what ? 
   five refugee shelters have been set alight in the german state in the last few weeks following the arrival of thousands of refugees fleeing war and poverty in the middle east and africa . 
  i 'll assume it was some pierogi accident . 
  totally worth it though . 
  if they 're buying a one way ticket to syria yeah that 's a huuuuge hint . 
  we can not stop them because they 're just going to turkey which is still legal . 
   says the european the irony is strong in this one . 
  hey the person was claiming that turkey has to fix all problems . 
  seems like they 're doing a poor job . 
  but i thought extreme right groups hated only on muslim refugees and that they love other europeans . 
   is n't it the wet dream of everyone on this subreddit that their countries stop cooperating with american intelligence ? 
  am french so nope , not at all . 
  i actually appreciate having an independent intelligence service . 
  and it 's proof enough that the us is not at all afraid of being a bully . 
  since the allegation of spying on the french are not fully recognized , it 's kinda bold to ask for exact source . 
  time will tell . 
   950 euros was found in his underwear . 
  are they sure they didnt raid a stripper ? 
  those costumes can be very confusing at times . 
   i was referring to the banning of paganism uhm it was an example . 
  the banning of ideas does work . 
   the notion of `` hate speech '' is poorly defined and can be extended in ways that can be considered abusive . 
  then move to the us . 
  because all other democracies have hate laws ( heck even the us has a form of them ) and they 're doing just fine . 
  believe it or not , people do n't see the benefit of protecting people who should `` kill all niggers '' . 
  the article says that they 'll use this definition :  the vocal or active opposition to fundamental british values , including democracy , the rule of law , individual liberty and the mutual respect and tolerance of different faiths and beliefs . 
  we also regard calls for the death of members of our armed forces as extremist . 
  i believe it is fair and anyone who disagrees should be banned from any public speaking activity . 
  edit : anyone who disagrees can move to saudi arabia or some other place that is more tolerant with their views . 
  you cant beat a red rocket . 
  what a time to be alive . 
  esa is more the scientific coordinator while the techonology ( rockets etc ) is handled by private companies . 
  ariane is built by airbus . 
  so unless companies suddenly decide that fundamental research is super important to them , no , space agencies are not part of history . 
   under modern laws this would be considered a major violation of human rights . 
  banning hate speech is a common thing . 
  it happens in all kinds of democracies from denmark to canada . 
   what you 're basically advocating for is pure totalitarianism . 
  no , no i am not . 
  if you have weird ass ideas and preach the killing of infidels off to an insolated prison with you where nobody can hear you scream and no young impressionable mind can have access to your hate speech . 
   half-hearted attempts thats why i am not half-hearted . 
  off to solitary confinement . 
  nobody has time to debate with cretins why their belief system is wrong . 
   enforcing orthodoxy since when is non-hate speech ideas * orthodoxy * ? 
  debating the propagators of hate does not help because they are not willing to prove through reasoned debated that their system of belief is better . 
  they just wan na kill and subjugate . 
  good luck debating that . 
  after you can debate with nazis why gas chambers are a bad idea . 
   it was just weird ( but interesting ) to hear a non-european take on it . 
  well that was what i meant . 
  someone who does n't know european history is quick to dismiss this or that country . 
  and it totally worked because the netherlands is a bastion of catholicism nowadays . 
   what we gon na do with bosnian ppl and albanians ? 
  they 're just the outliers . 
  a really small people that did n't have at all a huge impact on european culture . 
  small outliers are okay , turkey would be a pretty effing huge outlier . 
   then we are not europeans !, 
  like it or not , we are related !, 
  how is romania related to turkey ? 
  400 years of occupation and only a handful of muslims and a few turkish dishes . 
  that 's it ? 
  does romania produce turkish style music ? 
  does it look fondly towards mecca ? 
  what is the alphabet used in writing ? 
  what are the national holidays ? 
   christianity was originally banned by the romans , but it still flourished . 
  without constantine it would have never picked up . 
  it was only mildly banned , for large periods of time it was tolerated . 
   everyone is just submarine christians ( they only come up for easter and christmas ) . 
  and before exams .

  thanks to you !, 
  you made the good start out of it , 
  great system , sounds like a fair deal for once !, 
  i 'm a young professional so there is not so much i can win from anything ( except maybe the tax free threshold , but i 'm not even sure ) . 
  this is simply perfect . 
  i would love to hear about ~ ~ luke skywalker ~ ~ juppe 's sister , christine laguarde who would also make a good candidate in my opinion . 
  to me laguarde would be daenerys . 
  with no question . 
  juppe is more like john snow to me , stuck in a shithole ( sorry i love bordeaux ) , the rightfull heir , that was back stabbed by his peers and promise to a brilliant come back with enough chance . 
  he is the only hope we have , i dream about him kicking sarkozy 's ass on the first run . 
  do n't worry , we wo n't forget to celebrate the death of your monarchy . 
  on a more serious note , i think it 's a good idea to celebrate all national days like this . 
  it was n't only a political prison , but also a huge weapon and powder reserve . 
  hence the name , they just got poisoned by the perfide albion ... 
  hence the name , they just got poisoned by the perfide albion ... 
  because our glorious emperor was 30m tall ? 
  i just made the swap the other way around , i 'm a bit clueless about this system . 
  care to expand ? 
  really no surprise to see luxembourg here . 
  the poorer you are the more fucked by tax you will be ... 
  combien as tu d'enfants ? 
  yeah sorry , it 's like a combination of fancy and rural french . 
  really typical of the late middle age-renaissance period . 
  ( if there is a linguist here and i 'm mistaken please correct me ) so hard to describe , but so meaningful to us . 
  for instance , in this particular case , instead of threatening people of beheading / u/tex-to-speech - device used the term `` shorten above shoulders '' . 
  it 's like raw poetry . 
  i love it !, 
  [ dtc ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3b/ren%c3%a9_coty-1929.jpg ), 
  oh do n't be silly , you always knew we were the favorite brother . 
  you even prefer us over them :d, 
   alors , regarde ceci while absolutely perfect and very formal we will more use a casual `` ca '' on a reddit / online conversation topic ( us keyboard no other way to write it properly ) . 
  as always , i love having people practicing , and i love when people correct my mistakes in any languages . 
  anyway , thanks mate !, 
  call me blind , but i do n't know what they are really doing bad for europe at the moment . 
  `` de l'audace , de l'audace toujours de l'audace '' seriously , it should become our maxine ... 
  why did we gave up this french already ? 
  it 's so much more badass/funny/pleasant to read ... 
  definitely agree with that , as far as i 'm concerned , the longest peace era of europe is a proof that the dream worked . 
  i sincerely hope this wo n't prevent you to play at the world cup !, 
  i talked about both ... 
  i talked about both ... 
  because heavy co2 ( besides other things ) pollution is n't creating a cataclysmic future either ? 
  sorry , i 'm a bit bitter about the situation as our politician loves to take sweden as an example while : - we have very different cultures - more than 6 times the population ( the bigger the population , the harder it is to manage ) - the model is n't that efficient apparently ( despite some great achievement i admit ) . 
  we are showing the same empathy toward criminals lately and that makes me sick . 
  what do you suggest , returning to stone age ? 
  coal particulates pollution cause approximately one million deaths annually across the world . 
  nuclear energy ? 
  oh wait , no atmospheric pollution from the energy production . 
  but you might be referring to operational accidents :  separate studies found out that during the period from 1970 to 1992 , there were just 39 on-the-job deaths of nuclear power plant workers worldwide , while during the same time period , there were 6,400 on-the-job deaths of coal power plant workers , 1,200 on-the-job deaths of natural gas power plant workers and members of the general public caused by natural gas power plants , and 4,000 deaths of members of the general public caused by hydroelectric power plants . 
  oh you may want to talk about civilian nuclear incidents , less than a hundred . 
  while coal mining death toll is astronomical . 
  still want to discuss which is the most lethal and dangerous for us all ? 
  i would love to hear your argument against nuclear energy . 
  congratulation anti-nuclear activist . 
  you are responsible for 1000s of death in the near future . 
  in your country and other surrounding ... fuck you all . 
   let 's take brutal assault gang-rapes which is a crime hard to bury in statistics because of it 's impact in the press . 
  anybody with google can check that there have been dozens of brutal gang-rapes in sweden in recent history and that such a crime is extremely rare in most other countries of europe . 
   i thought it was the most progressive nation toward women ( and everyone ) in the world ... 
  or even worse , they only are in opposition with their adversaries . 
  it was a simple affirmation , your last answer was clearly an aggression . 
  mate , do n't be condescending , i do n't know your background and you have no idea about mine either . 
  except that at the moment it 's only the former that is happening . 
  and it 's in now way better than the later . 
  edit : and come on , engineer , scientist and technician are n't stupid people . 
  they have their understanding of law and could refer to it before making mistake . 
  i 'm not advocating for one side or the other , i want people to work together . 
  i do n't want to see morons like him deciding on their own extremely dangerous idea for everyone . 
  once again , cameron wanting a ban on encryption , is the perfect example of what i was saying . 
  he just has no idea of the implication of what he wants . 
  i think it 's ** at least ** as harmful as a group of technician expert discussing the topic without fully understanding how the law work . 
  i do n't know the denmark position/culture/regulation on this point , but in france religion is a private matter . 
  you can praise cthulhu in secret , as long as it does n't interfere with your job , it should n't be a problem . 
  i know a lot of people have the crazy view of catholic religion going batshit crazy against science , but it 's not the perspective i know from european religious guys . 
  you can perfectly believe in god ( ** as long as it remains private ** ) and accept all the scientific fact given . 
  i know it 's a totally stupid reference but to me , religion should be the answer to why , not how . 
  sorry mate , i was thinking physician while writing and reading physicist . 
   ( which means that some counsellor will stop him from actually doing anything stupid ) he actually claimed that several times now , nobody is stopping him and it 's actually frightening to see that he not even well advised . 
  anyway , it was mostly a single example i used because i 'm well aware about the topic . 
  i 'm even more scared about the level of their debate when i 'm not literate on the matter . 
  and you are absolutely correct about the ideology , too many time politician take the `` right way '' ( e.g. 
  defending internet neutrality ) only as an opposition to adversaries . 
  do n't you think it 's time to break this childish game ? 
  i do n't have the solution , but starting hearing the right people might be the key . 
  oh , and one last thing , in no way i said that i 'm the right person to be heard on the issue . 
  there is plenty of brilliant mind with appropriate background in europe able to talk and debate about the problem . 
  schroeder was a physicist ? 
  i thought he was only called doctor because he had a phd of some sort . 
  anyway , i 'm still not okay letting lawyer spreading bullshit over how the energy production should be managed or how to secure our interests . 
  the simple fact that cameron stating that kind of bullshit ( i only use this example as it 's really fresh but we also have our own ) , only show how they actually do n't understand shit about it . 
  so yes , it 's apparently that hard to understand technical matters . 
  sorry but as far as i 'm concerned , i 'm disturbed by this over-representation , and i would like to see things change for once . 
  i do n't say they should be put out of the game , but i see them more as a support of who should actually debate those problem rather than the major ( and only ) actor . 
   no offence but why enginers or technicians ? 
  i get scientists or economists but technicians ? 
  are they gon na debate over preferable bridge building techniques ? 
  none taken  to illustrate my point , i will pick-up a really recent example : how come a lawyer could debate on internet regulation without knowing shit about everything involved here ? 
  cameron stating that he wants to ban encryption makes the it security engineer i am , turning into a berserk wanting to burn the world . 
  they do n't have the bigger picture , they just do n't know anything about what they are talking about . 
  i do n't believe a lawyer is knowing more than me about ethic or the potential impact of a stupid statement on a really technical topic like this .

  [ -- christy moore singing this with stockton 's wing ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7c4ybdpaw8 ), 
  next question . 
  some commentary on politics.co.uk : [ may just handed nicola sturgeon the greatest gift she could ever ask for ] ( http://www.politics.co.uk/blogs/2017/03/16/may-just-handed-nicola-sturgeon-the-greatest-gift )  may neither blocked nor did n't block . 
  she found a land called ` the worst of all worlds ' and planted her flag on it . 
  she 's prepared to allow scotland to hold the referendum -- that 's implicit by the focus on timing - but be seen to block it until it finally takes place . 
  ...  since the brexit vote , the prime minister has worked tirelessly to conform to the snp stereotype of westminster . 
  they ignored scottish wishes and decided to pull britain out the single market . 
  they dismissed snp efforts to find a way for scotland to stay in . 
  they failed to give them a meaningful role in the great repeal bill overhaul of british law . 
  they threatened to block the devolution of agriculture and fisheries from brussels to edinburgh . 
  sturgeon may as well have written out the script , sent it to may , and have her follow it word for word . 
   scotland ~ ~ willingly ~ ~ reluctantly joined the union under a ~ ~ scottish king ~ ~ threat of bankruptcy, 
  i do n't have a problem with responsible gun ownership . 
  i grew up around guns , plenty of my extended family keep guns , and i 've shot for sport in the past . 
  however , i find the constant whining of the pro-gun lobby tedious in the extreme . 
   france has lots of grenade attacks . 
  what ? 
  since when ? 
  are you thinking of pomegranates ? 
  i did n't know they were the only options available ? 
   do you know anything about northern ireland 's history ? 
  lol . 
  i 'm irish . 
  i have family on both sides of the border . 
  i do n't think it 's up to the assembly . 
  i think it should be up to the people . 
  the dup supported brexit , so it 's clearly out of touch with the wishes of the majority of the people of northern ireland . 
  it even spent mysterious money from some mysterious source to push brexit in britain . 
  why do n't you want the people of northern ireland to be able to express a choice between brexit + uk ( or perhaps just eng + wal ) versus the eu and some sort of federation with roi ? 
  elections are about lots of things . 
  let 's have a clear poll . 
   just because they want to stay in the eu , it does n't mean they prioritise that over staying in the uk . 
  i agree , and in order to establish what they do prioritize , there should be a border poll . 
   why order a poll if the public have n't expressed a wish to change their constitutional status ? 
  on the contrary , the ni public expressed a wish to stay in the eu . 
  london is forcing a change in constitutional status , so the ni public should at least be asked to choose between brexit with the uk versus eu with the roi . 
  you seem to want this to be a catch-22 : the ni secretary wo n't order a poll if there 's no majority in favour of reunification , but the only way to determine whether there 's a majority in favour of reunification is to have a poll . 
  do you admit that there 's no media cover up ? 
   the good friday agreement says that a border poll ** will only be called ** no , it says that the secretary of state ** may order a poll **  if at any time it appears like to him that a majority of those voting would express a wish that northern ireland should cease to be part of the united kingdom and form part of a united ireland . 
  that does n't mean that a poll can only be called in those circumstances . 
  other reasons for a poll would be a significant change in the constitution of the uk , or a major revision to the framework on which the gfa is based . 
  is the uk entering into a massive constitutional change ? 
  does the gfa rely on the irish and uk governments being members of the eu and being signatories of the echr ? 
  if you answer yes to either of these , you 're acknowledging that there are grounds for a poll . 
   except they know that there 's no grounds to call one i disagree . 
  the uk is entering into a massive constitutional change , which will undermine the framework on which the good friday agreement was based . 
  there 's plenty of grounds to call a border poll . 
  nothing more boring that rifle nuts . 
  you 're deluded . 
  that video is a recording from a radio show . 
  it starts by discussing something obama said , viz `` trump is rattling world leaders '' . 
  that happened last year [ ( may 26 , 2016 - barack obama has said foreign leaders are `` rattled '' by donald trump ) ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/26/barack-obama-says-donald-trump-is-rattling-world-leaders ) . 
  ** now , when did the uk media start reporting on rotherham ? 
  ** [ well here 's february 2016 ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-35670538 ) , from the `` cover up '' bbc . 
  and here 's the `` cover up '' back in [ december 2015 ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-south-yorkshire-35074162 ) you 're engaging in and propagating fantasies . 
  it 's lying and deceitful . 
  you could spend 10 minutes verifying your bullshit instead of spreading it . 
  you 're the problem . 
  bro , do you even enumerate ? 
  we have n't even hit 60 days . 
  the media did n't cover up rotherham ya dope . 
  take it to the_d , they 'll be more interested . 
   did n't know the implications on ... personal data . 
   assumed that the `` open skies '' agreement would be gone davis is such a liability that i sometimes wonder if theresa may is playing a long con to ensure that brexit does n't happen . 
  i mean , between him and disgraced former defense minister , dr liam fox , you 've got to wonder what has inspired her staffing choices if not a plan for future failure . 
  sauternes goes very well with roquefort , but i 'm guessing dick is a little bit less cheesy . 
  perhaps a nice chablis ? 
   but how can you say whether you have or do n't have an issue if you ca n't measure it ? 
  why do n't we have cameras recording everything that happens on every street ? 
  do n't we leave ourselves blind ? 
   if statistics prove that fn is wrong it will ruin their campaign and the topic will disappear . 
  what makes you think the fn or their supporters will respond to evidence ? 
  let 's say you prove that brown people are net economic contributors , the fn will complain about culture being under threat . 
  then you prove that brown people do n't threaten french culture , the fn will complain about traditional values being under threat . 
   why gathering facts is forbidden . 
  because if the government keeps a record of everyone 's ethnicity or religion , an authoritarian government can use that to persecute a minority group . 
   these statements are widely supported by their followers , so , there is no way this will make them unhappy . 
  widely supported by some of their followers , but not all . 
  some of their more recent supporters are `` des cas sociaux '' ( welfare cases ) . 
  they wo n't be happy . 
   beno\u00eet loeuillet shows him ( the journalist ) several books he sells , including books by adolf hitler or robert faurisson , who has been regularly condemned for denying the reality of the shoah . 
  this leader of the fn in nice says at first that he `` does not know what to think of the revisionist thesis '' . 
  `` it 's complicated , but after that , i think there were not as many deaths , there were not 6 million , '' he said . 
   `` there were no mass deaths as it was said , '' he added , citing as a `` proof '' the `` leuchter '' report , named after an american `` hired by robert faurisson '' , according to the historian val\u00e9rie igounet , and who in the late 1980s wrote a document that became a `` reference for negationists . '', 
   in this documentary , we also see philippe vardon , ex-figure of the identitaire ( cultural isolationists ) of nice , now regional adviser to the fn in paca and also member of the campaign team of marine le pen , say ironically during a scene : `` it 's getting worrying : all the guys who shake my hand , they 're black . '', 
  i 'm guessing coq au vin does n't count , huh ? 
   alex salmond described it as such . 
  however , he 's no longer the first minister of scotland , nor the leader of the snp . 
  i 've no issue with that - my personal view is that brexit is a constitutional change of such magnitude that everything is back on the table for discussion , including irish reunification . 
  i 'd rather people were clear on the `` once in a generation '' point though , as a generation is 20 to 30 years , whereas a `` lifetime '' is 70 to 80 years . 
  i watched the interview too . 
  the title seems quite fair . 
  yes that 's correct , it 's the disgraced former defense secretary , dr liam fox . 
  he allowed his friend adam werrity to attend meetings at the ministry of defence ** without first obtaining security clearance . 
  ** werrity had access to fox 's diary , printed business cards announcing himself as his advisor , and even joined him at meetings with foreign dignitaries . 
  [ an investigation by then cabinet secretary sir gus o'donnell found that fox had shown a lack of judgement by blurring the lines between his official role and his personal friendships . 
  his report concluded : `` the disclosure outside the mod of details about future visits overseas posed a degree of security risk not only to dr fox , but also to the accompanying official party . '' ] ( http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/uk/2016/02/less-shameless-world-liam-fox-s-career-would-have-ended-2011 ), 
  i ca n't believe the interviewer does n't pull him up on this . 
  she just lets him waffle on . 
  i think it was billed as `` once in a generation '' , which is significantly shorter than a ( non-glasgow ) lifetime ?

   yes , not all blacks are disadvantaged and not all whites are advantaged do n't change the subject to race . 
   let me make a wild guess , you 're probably a white male , eh ? 
  so are you , but i do n't want to play this progressivism game , cause then you 'll say you 're gay , and i 'll retort that my butler was mean to me as a child , and you 'll retort you have psychological problems , and i 'll retort that i have uncurable eczema , and the truth at hand will drift farther and farther away . 
   so am i perhaps , but it 's not coincidental that those who have the most advantages are the ones who are most often against societal change . 
  this principle , taken to its conclusion , makes discussion redundant , and action the only way out . 
  and since we 're talking death counts , literally hitler , and `` but progressivism never did anything wrong '' , i think pol pot 's application of this principle to justify genocide of city-dwellers deserves an honourable mention . 
  i abhor it and value discussion , but why are * you * here ? 
  all you will hear is my privilege talking , so you might as well ignore or even censor me ; progressivism 's opposition to freedom of speech makes perfect sense . 
  elliot rodger was n't an mra by any means , and he was n't even a redpiller . 
   problem with the whole ` lenses ' argument and the ` sjws are as bad as far-right ' is the difference in the actual effects . 
  sjws are a non-issue outside of internet , really , how many people have their lives ruined by them ? 
  i just told you i do n't care about sjws , i care about feminists . 
  how many more men died because feminists ignored and belittled the plight of men and sucked off all the empathy and the resources with their slanderous one-way theories to give them exclusively to women ? 
  if getting dv shelters is so important to the lives of women , why are there almost no male shelters ? 
  if getting an education is so important to women , why is n't there an outcry and a counter-program that men only get 40 % of college degrees ? 
   sometimes the progressivism on this site is skin-deep , it 's progressive when it comes time to criticise putin , but reactionary when it comes time to be honest with oneself and criticise your own situation . 
  why are you telling me this ? 
  i do not respect progressivism , i respect the ideals of the enlightenment ( individualism , rationality , equality before the law , freedom of speech ) , and i believe progressivism/pc to be an enemy to them . 
  i do not want a progressive medal , and you ca n't excommunicate me from this small-minded cult i want no part in . 
  i do n't know why you 're complaining about the term sjw . 
  my problem with it , and the term `` radical feminists '' ( as used by critics ) , is that it lets regular feminists off the hook . 
  the truth is , the radicals are but a symptom of how flawed feminism itself is , a sort of living reductio ad absurdem of feminism . 
  if you 're not a black lesbian trans * mentally divergent person of kin who uses all the right words and supports all the right causes , your opinion is invalid , and your problems an insult to decency . 
  this is just taking the concept of privilege , and feminism 's tendency to dismiss men 's pov , to its logical conclusion . 
  as for reddit , it 's not as clearcut , they are critical of certain apects of feminism , but they do not usually cross the line into outright anti-feminism as i did here . 
  the standard conversation goes like this : `` feminism says this '' * mildly upvoted * `` but sjw bad '' * upvoted * `` but other feminism good '' * mildly upvoted * `` no , feminism bad '' * downvoted * `` mras as bad as sjws '' * upvoted * -- what looks like reactionary lunatic nazism to you is far too tame for me . 
  we all have our own lenses , do n't we ? 
  i do n't know , swedish feminists complained about men taking up too much space on busses , calling it a `` normalized expression of power '' and the feminist party wants a man tax . 
  yeah but mostly liberals and libertarians , and those have a critical view of us foreign policy and over-the-top american patriotism . 
  as i frequently criticize feminists for focussing too much on `` microaggressions '' and the sexism of evil nerds and not enough on cases and places where women 's rights are truly trampled on , i have to give her credit for her principled stand . 
  at some point , we have to decide if we take our morals seriously , whether we call them `` human rights '' or `` the greatest happiness for the greater number of people '' . 
  whatever we call it , sa does n't have a political system conductive to that . 
  i feel offended when our politicians claim we have a close , friendly relationship with that sort of country . 
  not only do their oppress their population , but they , directly and indirectly , support our enemies and encourage hatred of our countries , our way of life , our people ( the fact that this derives from their religion is no excuse and does n't change the outcome ) . 
  any relationship we have with them needs to be to our certain benefit . 
  if they profit too , so be it . 
  but in this case , they decided to threaten a boycott and recall their ambassadors over some truthful comments . 
  this breakdown , over words , is entirely their doing . 
  the `` friend '' requires us to keep silent about his abuses to have the privilege to commerce with it . 
  just like he required us to censor our cartoons , our newspapers . 
  so we are getting the worse end of the bargain , and we do n't need a friend like that . 
  one is more , the other is less . 
  but sometimes less is more , and more is less . 
  in conclusion the right amount of details eludes us . 
  oh come on now , i 'm tired of this pessimism , we 're doing even better than the african union . 
  the minister of the interior just released new figures . 
  the fn came in third in votes , with 25 % , after main right ( 36 % ) and main left ( 28 % ) party . 
  had to scroll all the way down for my childhood sweetheart . 
  tfw monsters want to join your army . 
  given all the eu iv love itt , i 'll do my hipster and submit imperialism ii , a glorious predecessor ( and far better , you plebs ) . 
  why ? 
  they 're the european central bank , responsible for the monetary policy of hundreds of millions of relatively well-off people , they can work in a nice building . 
  are they supposed to eat soup and live in tents as long as a single european is worse off ? 
  should we stop paying politicians and government employees becuase it 's very bad and problematic that they 're better off than some of the people they serve ? 
  now i do n't know what to believe . 
  it 's the paradox of the honest liar . 
  you have to be a level above your run-of-the-mill `` great powers '' ( france , gb ) in diplomatic , economic and military power . 
  you have to be able to project that power anywhere in the world and not just to your neighbours . 
  in history , only the old british empire , the us and the ussr were said to be superpowers . 
  modern russia does n't qualify . 
  the honk kong interior design business school . 
  this is meaningless if you do n't compare it to some other society . 
  germans are not more collectivist than the french or the danes . 
  more than the us and gb , but less than most of the rest of the world . 
  if isis is the face of the downtrodden , we 're not trodding enough . 
  as for this planet being god-forsaken , if only ... we may be through with god , but god is not through with us . 
  they 're not peasants , they do n't think they 're peasants , they think they 're warriors . 
  they want to live off other people 's riches , be they enemies ( kill , then steal ) or subdued ( protection money ) , like the mafia , like their prophet . 
  you should go to raqqa and expand on your very convincing argument so they can understand what they really think . 
  disagree . 
  do n't say it 's worse no doubt if you `` do n't really like comparing despicable acts '' . 
  if the numbers are correct ( and the arab slave trade is considerably less studied ) , it would mean the european was more intensive and ephemeral , the arab was more of a grind , an ever-present horrific institution in the background which no one thought to correct over more than a millenia . 
  hard to tell which is worse . 
  so the glass is and will always be half full ? 
  ah , the good ole days when we produced our own chairs , clothes and needles on our idyllic farm under the setting sun . 
  no , they were n't significantly worse . 
  the arab slave trade was just as bad , and the numbers are the same/comparable ( ~ 15 million ) . 
  note that this number does n't include the millions enslaved by the dehli sultanate and the mughals . 
  what is this ? 
  a tax rate for bums ? 
  i 'll eat my currywurst without mayonnaise just for you , liebchen . 
  we are bros compared to almost anyone else , based on shared values , culture and interests . 
  our `` friendship circles '' go roughly like this : - immediate neighbours - other europeans - west ( including usa , canada , etc ) - friendly developing countries ( south america ) - neutral developing countries ( china ) - hostile non-west countries ( russia ) - enemy non-west countries ( north korea , isis ), 
  the adult women ( who pechtold calls `` indoctrinated girls '' ) who go there have made their bed . 
  kids are a different story . 
  but practically , it 's hard to take kids away from their parents . 
  i do n't think anyone is arguing that dutch children on their own should be turned away at the border . 
  oh , you 're one of those people . 
  racist , huh ? 
  i must have said something against islam . 
   among the severe and long-lasting detrimental effects of institutionalized discrimination on affected populations are increased suicide rates , suppressed attainment of wealth and decreased access to health care . 
  two out of three seem to primarily affect men , so there goes your point . 
   of course women are capable of competing . 
  we 'll never know , because now they wo n't need to . 
  i want quotas for everything . 
  male quotas for anything female dominated . 
  red-haired quotas for anything dark-hair dominated . 
  short people quotas for ... etc. 
  everyone just gets a ticket at birth , and his place in society is assigned based on the quotas we need to have . 
   but there are also indoctrinated girls with them .

  but ... but ... immigrants commit crimes at disproportional levels . 
  they literally commit more crime than europeans . 
  they are more violent . 
  wikipedia lists sources for their statistics which happen to be from reputable sources . 
  did you know that wikipedia has a higher accuracy rate than encyclopedia britannica ? 
  also , you ca n't just piss around and edit wikipedia pages , you have to be an approved poster/submitter . 
  wikipedia also has moderators . 
  and facts ca n't be racist . 
  it is the truth . 
  over 50 % of homicides in the usa are committed by blacks , over 50 % of the prison population is black . 
  were those facts racist ? 
  ummm so why import more people to commit crime ? 
  people are tired of immigrants coming to europe and blantatly disrespecting our laws , customs , traditions and history - this happens thousands of times . 
  says the englishman ? 
  have n't immigrants fucked up the u.k. enough already ? 
  why do only western / white countries have to open doors to immigration ? 
  why ca n't we keep europe for europeans ? 
  not like america , my friend . 
  almost ** everyone ** in some states own guns . 
  or those people who say ; `` they 're only stealing because we do n't give them enough . '', 
  or when they say `` it is because of american/western interests that these refugees are even here in the first place . 
  `` s some people like to pin problems on the `` big bad western world '', 
  maybe he 's of italian decent ? 
  maybe his wife is from italy ? 
  maybe he lives in italy ? 
  i am not a french citizen but my fianc\u00e9 is french . 
  my parents were born in france , but i was born in canada . 
  can i not have an opinion ? 
  i am capable of following european politics , you know . 
  just because you 're from europe does n't mean you know more about europe . 
  no it is n't . 
  preserve europe for europeans . 
  demographic predictions place europe at 20-30 % muslim ( or even higher ) in the coming decades . 
  how do you start protesting , violence and general misbehaviour and expect to be welcomed into someone else 's country ? 
  fuck these people . 
  autobahn is in germany . 
  you know you did n't have any problems . 
  you enjoyed driving through france . 
  i 'm not saying deport the immigrants we have now . 
  i 'm not saying stop immigration . 
  i would like to see decreased immigration , and an emphasis placed on native swedes repopulating . 
  what is wrong with a nation where swedes represent 85 % + ? 
  nothing . 
  what is wrong with france being 85 % + ethnic french ? 
  nothing . 
  what is wrong with a country like nigeria being 95 % + black ? 
  nothing . 
  do i want nigeria to open itself to immigration to become `` diverse '' no . 
  i travel to nigeria to experience nigerian culture , not the cultures of 30 different ethnicities . 
  when you travel to egypt , morocco , china , the phillippines , you expect a very homogenous nation , and i want that . 
  i go to your country to experience your culture , architecture and cuisine , not your immigrant groups . 
  apparently only white countries need to be `` diverse '' there is nothing wrong with being ethnically homogenous . 
  i do understand the consequences . 
  i actually studied caribbean history ( massive amounts of slavery ) and the implications it has today . 
  considering i 'll probably live to around 85-90 , i will start to see france and other western nations have their % of whites decrease to 50-60 % of the population . 
  when i die , france will probably be only 50 % white . 
  well , france is only around 80 % of french ancestry now . 
  it is expected to go lower . 
  maybe it will be 60 % french when i die . 
  and norway is next , norway is 86 % norwegian . 
  immigrant groups are immigrating faster and having children faster than ethnic norwegians . 
  i say ethnic norwegians fall below 60 % by the time you die . 
  there are only 5,000,000 of you !!!!!, 
  preserve your wonderful , beautiful nation and people . 
  there is nothing wrong with your country being 90 % + white . 
  i have not and never will feel `` guilty '' about what my ancestors did * hundreds of years ago * . 
  you should n't either . 
  * retarded racist goals ? 
  are n't they just trying to keep sweden for ethnic swedes ? 
  like muslims trying to keep their own countries for muslims , jews for jews , india for indians etc. . see the trend ? 
  a norwegian displaying incredible white guilt ? 
  well i am soooo surprised . 
  not really . 
  i like being white . 
  you seem like a swell guy . 
  a real cracker to hang out with . 
  rip europe and european culture, 
  it is funny that an englishman , of all people , does n't understand neocolonialism, 
  how the fuck was he being racist ? 
  goddamn sensitive/over politically correct people these days, 
  separatist movements always have irked me . 
  just remain in spain , and support your regional culture . 
  simple . 
  why would you want to go from a population of 47 million to 2 million ? 
  think of all the land , people , money , economic activity you 'll be losing !, 
  you 'll be in a tiny little country !, 
  7 % of the population ( black men ) are responsible for 50 % + of homicides in america . 
  the wealthiest income bracket of blacks in america still commits more homicide than the poorest income bracket of whites on a per capita basis . 
  it is a cultural problem within the black male population . 
  nearly every black male in america knows someone in jail , or who has been to jail . 
  on the other hand , the appalachian mountains in west virginia is the most impoverished place in the united states . 
  the population is 90 % + white , and they have next to zero violent crime . 
  the united states has 315 million people and vastly different socio-economics and criminality . 
  its not bad per say , just a little disgraceful that france is being represented 55 % + from the african continent . 
  simple . 
  we stop islamic immigration and we do n't have these `` homegrown '' terrorists . 
  they have literally done nothing to benefit european society . 
  and we should limit islamic immigration . 
  what have they done beneficial ? 
  what have they done except prove that they do n't assimilate , that they commit disproportional amounts of crime , that they bring archaic ideas to our continent .

  it 's real in france too . 
  i 'm not coming at you in any way . 
  just giving a longer , perhaps more brutal opinion . 
  i mean you started your comment with this :  what they need are jobs , middle class jobs yeah sure . 
  some do get middle class jobs . 
  you know who else would like a middle class job ? 
  not everybody can get one . 
  i have a university degree , am perfectly bilingual , white , blond , and i have a minimum wage job . 
  i 'm not saying racism and discrimination does n't exist . 
  it surely does . 
  but the job market is hard for most . 
  i suck it up and hope i can gather experiences and eventually rise up . 
  i do n't burn cars and break stuff though . 
  kids in the country , who are poorer than they are , do n't break stuff either . 
  where 's our news article ? 
  i do n't want to be a complete dick , but your painfully naive comment needs something to oppose it . 
  have you ever experienced recruitment with some people from these neighborhoods ? 
  i 've seen some job `` candidates '' . 
  some of them are * not * recruitable , you would n't want them near you , and it 's not because of their skin colour or whatnot . 
  they 're not recruitable not because of lack of education ; they went to the same obligatory public schools as those who managed , those who know how to respect others , but because of their own completely toxic attitude . 
  though i have personal examples , the best example i have comes from my brother . 
  he went for a few days in recruitment for the french military . 
  you 'd think that to become a soldier , all the candidates would understand that they need to be in their best behaviour . 
  it 's the military for fuck 's sake . 
  but fuck no . 
  they were around 30 candidates , about 20 of them were basically these hoodlums . 
  they 'd answer back to the officers , would drag their fucking feet like they were in kindergarten . . etc. . needless to say , they were progressively all kicked out until of the 30 initial recruits , there were only 5 left at the end . 
  decent people , from diverse backgrounds , be they upper class , to farmer kids , to people from overseas territories . 
  but people who gave a shit . 
  people with the basic social skills to understand where they were and how to act accordingly . 
  now certainly , `` society '' must have created a mentality where a bunch of these kids are not recruitable , and they will never be functioning members of society . 
  however , i do believe they 'll never be functioning members of society until they themselves decide to change their attitude . 
  i do think much of their attitude is deliberate . 
  it 's a shit attitude . 
  and thankfully , many grow out of it , a little too late to become `` middle class '' , but at some point they do grow the fuck up . 
  yeah , it 's not like we spend millions on these suburbs already . . oh wait . 
  well actually , my grandmother * was * walloon , so yeah kind of . 
  in france we have a few public tv channels owned by `` france t\u00e9l\u00e9visions '' ( france 2 , france 3 , france 4 , france 5 , france \u00d4 , arte ... ) , which i would say lean slightly to the left , or would be center-left perhaps . 
  especially the channels which delve in more political/social subjects ( france 2 , arte ) are rather left leaning . 
  the private channels ( tf1 , m6 , direct 8 ) can be rather right-leaning , though some ( canal + ) are left-leaning . 
  i do n't know much about radio , but i 'd say it 's pretty much similar . 
  public radios may be rather left-leaning whereas private radios owned by large private media corporations may be rather right-leaning . 
  newspapers , however , are quite clearly defined on the political spectrum , and people here buy their newspapers according to their political views . 
  even a big well known newspaper like le monde , to maintain its reputation as a prestigious news source would rather present itself as neutral , is pretty much known to be leaning to the mainstream left . 
  i 've been to spain many times during my teen years . 
  stayed about a month in each ( summer `` linguistic trip '' as we call them ) . 
  loved them , had a great time ( malaga is hot as fuck though , i 'd take siestas myself ! ) . 
  another time i was in the french pyrenees , and with my family we hiked over a mountain to the spanish side , no biggy . 
  and like a mirage , we encountered a sort of chalet , which was a spanish restaurant just alone there in the middle of nowhere , on the mountain , held by a family . 
  the little girl had the deepest blue eyes i 've ever seen . 
  just a random memory for ya . 
   to actively pursue that kind of bloodshed beyond just controlling borders thing is that it was n't that simple , though . 
  i was talking about the 1600s , that was n't under napoleon of course , but under cardinal richelieu and louis xiv . 
  there were many dynamics which go beyond just wanting to invade other people . 
  of all things actually , france was so overpowered it could have gone on to do much more damage . 
  but it was a game of alliances and balances and diplomacy . 
  no leader actively sought to massacre other people . 
  napoleon gets an unfair rep , especially in anglo countries . 
  after the french revolution , most european countries attacked france to counter the dangerous revolutionary ideals ( which arguably were the right ideas compared to most other countries ' systems , despite the revolution having gone badly eventually ) . 
  whenever france won , the other european countries regrouped , reformed alliances and attacked again . 
  when napoleon got to power , because of the constant war by other countries and thus the need for a powerful leader , he inherited that state of affairs . 
  i wo n't say napoleon did n't himself sometimes seek conflict , but the dynamic in europe was set , that france wo n't be left alone as long as it does n't have a king on the throne . 
  so there was hardly any other way it could have gone . 
  but ultimately , what 's funny is that you 're reacting to me saying that france was strong at the time , instead of reacting to those making fun of france surrendering , despite hundreds of thousands of french dead . 
  why do n't you get all flustered about * that * ? 
  you only seem to be focused on one side of the issue . 
  well , we 're pretty well placed nowadays , so pretty far . 
  oh yeah , it 's definitely traditional of brittany ( bretagne ) . 
  you can get them elsewhere though , in breton restaurants which are popular enough , but i guess you need to know where they are . 
  it 's true that a basic take-out or caf\u00e9 in the rest of france , will rather serve white-flour cr\u00eapes , usually for a [ sugary desert ] ( http://www.fresh-kreps.com/wp-content/uploads/photokreps/crepes1.jpg ) ( but sometimes as [ a salt main course ] ( http://p6.storage.canalblog.com/67/22/1016167/77785784_o.jpg ) ) . 
  i wish it were true :p i 've heard it already , but i remember researching it and not finding anything serious in that regard , so i 'm assuming it 's just a legend . 
  would be cool though . 
  5 years ago i had a manual labour job in the french countryside and we were housed in tents and had to make our own food after a hard day 's work . 
  we were mostly french , but there were a few foreigners , so as a little joke to the foreigners we decided to cook some frog legs once . 
  it was the first time most of us french people had eaten some ourselves ( including me ) . 
  that 's the first and last time i ate frog legs . 
  they were good enough . 
  they seriously taste like chicken , with the texture of fish . 
  but i 'd rather buy chicken or fish . 
  i must have eaten escargots a year ago . 
  however , i used to buy some frozen escargots much more regularly ( every other month ) , as they 'd be ready in 10 minutes if you pop them in the oven , and they 're pretty good as a snack with some fresh bread . 
  but i guess that was a `` phase '' for me . 
  i figured they were an easy/good snack to make . 
  most french people hardly ever eat escargots , perhaps just occasionally in restaurants or during specific settings ( like new years , marriages or something ) . 
  it 's really easy as fuck , to be honest . 
  i just cheat because i buy premade dough . 
  in france , in every supermarket you can buy [ these sorts of packages ] ( http://media.simplymarket.fr/photo2/3596710/364435.jpg ) with premade cr\u00eapes . 
  you just pop one on a buttered pan , [ throw in a slice of ham , sprinkle with grated cheese , and break an egg on top ] ( http://recettes.viabloga.com/images/galette_de_sarrazin_complete.jpg ) , salt , pepper , i like adding some parsley on top , then when the egg looks cooked enough some 5 minutes later [ you fold that bad boy ] ( http://www.ouest-cornouaille.com/upload/ble-noir-complete_creperie-menlanndu-xl.jpg ) with the yolk in the middle , and [ voil\u00e0 ] ( http://cdn.recettes100.fr/v/fr/4/4893ae7c73432fb03a49f77c46639b4d.jpg ) . 
  huh , i actually ate two cr\u00eapes for dinner yesterday . 
  i bought a premade dough , to be honest ( cause who has time for that ? 
  ) , and then put in some ham , grated cheese and egg . 
  i made a certain type of cr\u00eape called `` galette '' though , which is more traditional with dough made of buckwheat . 
  [ that 's ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/14/galette_compl%c3%a8te_in_annecy%2c_france_-_20130714.jpg ) what it looks like . 
  the way i see it is people joke around that we had a white flag as our banner and they find it ironic , but the actual irony is that we probably slapped them around at the time when we were flying the white flag . 
  which is ironic because the 1600s is a period in history when we kicked the most amount of ass for the longest time . 
  a couple marks & spencer supermarkets opened in paris in the last few years and they seem popular because the products are so adorably british and whatnot . 
  anyway , british musical bands have been popular here of course . 
  often enough , a british film will be mainstream in cinemas here . 
  as someone else said , british-style pubs exist in touristy areas . 
  tshirts with the union jack , or doc martens .

  ask yourself ? 
   also , even if it was so , why would it even matter ? 
  it does n't matter and it 's awful that you had to go through that ( if that actually happened ) . 
  `` a friend '', 
  sounds like you 're describing your own experience to me ... 
  so you 're bragging about a moocher country that basically lives off of its neighbors and you are n't even swiss yourself ? 
  you sound like a typical low level expat , someone they imported into swiss to clean out some office bathroom . 
  switzerland 's success can be entirely described to its neighbors and our passiveness towards their shitty , selfish behavior . 
  belgium , in fact , tried to do this * way * before switzerland , we crushed them , twice . 
  what support is south east england getting from the rest of the uk ? 
  why would that support be non-existent if they 'd be a separate country ? 
  luxembourg and switzerland are doing pretty well mooching off of their neighbors . 
  correct !, 
  i 'd never say no to an english gentleman . 
  she 'll lose , people are pissed at her and vestager . 
  i really ca n't think of one european country but the uk and ireland that does n't have pretty hot average people , seriously . 
  yup , do n't forget it 's a country of five million people . 
  cut-out south-east england from the rest of the uk and you 'd probably have a country that far exceeds the standard of living of `` scandinavia '' . 
  oh , you 're one of those eastern european brits , got it !, 
  `` actual statistics '' , you 're referring to your crappy index ? 
  spain has been caught red-handed defrauding statistics ( just a couple of days ago for crying out loud !, 
  ) , it 's countries like yours who make indexes like the one you 've linked untrustworthy . 
   i 'm not butthurt because of your crap of an union that 's not actually an union and more like your `` countries-that-i-like-based-on-bullshit '' list ... but rather surprised of how someone can actually eat that shit up all by himself . 
  nop , you 're definitely without a doubt butthurt . 
  you were from the very start . 
  oh , you have n't at all , i 've a thick skin and i 'm an anti-nationalist so i do n't get insulted by comments like yours . 
  people have been attacking france the entire day now , after i 've criticized their own or another country so i was still in that mindset . 
  the funny thing is that i 'm probably the loudest critic of france and our policies . 
  just love how most of you guys try to criticize france but fail miserably at it . 
  there are so many flaws here that you guys could point out to but yet , you guys seem to miss them all . 
  rural france is beautiful and actually well-developed , a horrible example to point out . 
  people from all over europe and the world move to french villages and the countryside for a reason . 
  let me point you towards a direction : pathetic government ? 
  spineless idiotic president ? 
  horrible drivers ? 
  lost neighborhoods ? 
  rude people ? 
  large budget deficits ? 
  lack of reform ? 
  lazy unionized workers ? 
  i mean the options are endless people !, 
  rural france is n't rural poland . 
  perhaps it is because no one cares about it ? 
  i mean , this is something we 'll first hear and read about in the newspaper on monday morning somewhere on page 5 in the corner . 
  full un security council member , able to extract power outside of europe , strong army , one of the leading voices in the eu and europe , ... france is a worldpower . 
  love how you 're butthurt because spain ca n't join my ** imaginary ** union , you 're pathetic . 
  oh yes , we absolutely are . 
  one of the most powerful state in the world is a burden for little 5 million people finland whose on the brink of a financial and economic collapse because of nokia 's phone division bankruptcy . 
  your industry is a laughing stock compared to that of france , which leads the world in countless areas . 
  probably the most important point my government wants to see become reality , and it 's one of the few point i agree with . 
  denmark is insignificant , they 're a small powerless state . 
  they 're more than welcome to join my imaginary union but it is n't a necessity . 
  let 's just say that i wo n't lose any sleep at night when they refuse my imaginary offer . 
   the corruption index for spain it 's not too far from france , actually i do n't care what the corruption index says , spain is still too corrupt . 
  just a couple of days ago the eu decided to fine your country because some autonomous region decided to cook the books . 
  that 's pretty symptomatic for spain and are issues you guys desperately need to address . 
  you were part of the soviet union . 
  then the cia world factbook is the only one that is accurate . 
  spain is too immature , corrupt and hawkish ( gibraltar ) to be part of a true federalized union . 
  i love spain but you 've still got some serious issues you need to address , not until then will you be able to join my imaginary federalized union . 
  the six founding members , austria , denmark , uk , ireland , finland , sweden are the most optimal partners for this . 
  all of us could have used the money we 've lost on greece on ourselves , literally all of us . 
  i 'm sorry to hear that finland is going to rough waters ( again , most of us are - includes especially my country ) , i 'm confident that you guys will do just fine . 
  if not , we 're here to help as finland is without a doubt infinitely more important to us than greece economically . 
   us `` not willing to deepen ties within eu '' is only a side-effect of our internal struggle . 
  sure , i apologize for my premature statement then . 
  i 'm sorry but you guys are eastern european . 
  * similar * is what i 've said . 
   for once candidates are ex-teachers and the like . 
  a parliament filled with actual regular people rather than etonian , oxbridge graduates . 
  ugh , that 's sickening . 
  lithuania perhaps not , but other eastern european countries like estonia definitely do . 
  finland is a political burden as you guys definitely are n't willing to deepen the ties within the eu . 
  finland is not a financial burden , rather the opposite is true . 
  maybe we should just go back to the 6 founding members , the rest is nothing but a political or financial burden . 
  i think estonia leads in the anti-russian propaganda funding to be honest . 
  latvia and lithuania are better at ignoring the schizophrenic idiot in the kremlin . 
  most of us here , except for the hardcore federalists , want the uk to stay in the union . 
  it was a very vicious and polarizing electoral campaign , there 's no way that 'd be able to compromise over that . 
  you 're confusing the shit out of my fellow countrymen and women . 
  last week we read about how you used the germans to spy on us on our industry and now this ... 
  they 've no idea whether they should love or hate you guys . 
   `` starter party '' who are you quoting there ? 
  i 've never used those words nor did i gave the impression that the snp is a `` starter party '' . 
  i 've said that they all of a sudden grew exponentially overnight requiring them to look for new candidates over a short period of time . 
  one of the problems for political parties who grow exponentially over a short period of time , like the snp , is that they 've troubles finding excellent candidates so they end up with opportunists , youngsters , idiots and people who 're unfit in general in the short term . 
  again , no one cares . 
  i 've never heard of `` leuven '' , reuters has never heard of leuven and huawei most likely uses leuven as it is located ` near ' brussels . 
  there 's absolutely no need to point out each and every time that this is the result of fptp , i 'm fairly sure that more than half of / r/europe knows by now . 
  if the uk had a more representative system , they 'd be fucked today having no workable coalition possible . 
  i 'd argue that fptp saved the uk from a belgian style political crisis . 
  nop , antwerp is farther away and it can distinguish itself because of its large port . 
  leuven is known for absolutely nothing internationally + situated incredibly close to brussels . 
  never said belgians do n't give a shit , i 'm saying that the world does n't give a shit . 
  leuven is just brussels , it 's as simple as that . 
  that 's how huawei sees it , that 's how reuters literally says it and that 's how i view it . 
  just let them waste their money on pathetic things , no one cares . 
  it 's not like russia 's population in general can not get more anti-western . 
  besides , i bet the baltics , poland and other countries who 're anti-russian do similar things . 
  article says brussels and according to google maps `` leuven '' is right next to brussels .

i know it 's sad , but i immediatly though to the consequences for the brexit . 
  clearly , the eu is attacked . 
  what the brits think ? 
  will it reinforce the : `` yes '' -  `` eu is dangerous , too much immigrants and open boarders '' or `` no '' -  `` we 're with the eu in this fight and will not abandon our allies now '', 
  pretty sure that all french commentators pronounce the ` ch ' . 
  no , italian/english , as the french one which is in french/english . 
  sincerely , i do n't know if i do n't prefer plain english instead of this hybrid shit , it reminds me k-pop crap with korean and english chorus for retarded . 
  i will vote for austria , bosnia , macedonia . 
  i really do n't understand what 's the point of eurovision if we sing with the same language . 
  not particularly clever but i ca n't see where it 's a trump-ism . 
  it 's still less extreme than obama or any other us president with guantanamo . 
  everybody hope you leave  . 
  english is little more than french badly pronounced ( g. cl\u00e9menceau quote : `` l'anglais ? 
   people : scandinavian there are blond peope in france . 
   buildings : germanic there are germanic buildings in france ( alsace ) . 
   background : swiss alp alps are also in france ( actually , the most beautiful and highest peak is in france ) . 
   food : southern ( spanish or italian . . and maybe french ) typical mediterranean food is extremely popular in the south of france . 
   government : united kingdom with queen kings and all that deal the biggest royal domain of the world is in france ( versailles ) . 
  you perfectly described france :d !, 
   also britain went through a phase where it encouraged encorporation of other cultures ( nicking the best bits ) whereas france 's colonial attitude , right until the end , was to convert the colonials into french people completely . 
  britain were like `` we are so amazing it does n't really matter so long as people do what they are told when we want them to '' and the french were like `` we are so amazing everyone should be exactly like us '' so it 's not surprising that a french person ca n't see a way of encorporating another culture 's food into their own culture ( even when they like the other culture 's food ) . 
  you 're probably right but i think that the problem is also that we have too much diversity in our own culture 's food to add more stuff to that . 
  the regional diversity is crazy with a lot of influences and constrasts from our culturally very rich neighbours ( we have nearly the same gastronomy than italia in the southern france with tomatoes and olive oil everywhere , but also a butter everywhere gastronomy in bretagne , a bit of germany in alsace , a part of the spanish gastronomy with pays basque ... ) + all the overseas territories that are legitimely considered as part of the french culinary heritage ( by example chicken colombo and cayenne 's chili from french guyana ) . 
  some people that are born in french algeria also consider couscous or tajine as french food , but this is much more debatable because algeria is no longer french . 
  all in all , there is so much things to consider as french food that we have difficulties to add all the influences from ex-colonies , and there are clearly things that were clearly created by french or franco-vietnamese in the vietnamese gastronomy : http://theculturetrip.com/asia/vietnam/articles/b-nh-to-baguettes-french-influences-on-vietnamese-cuisine/ the use of baguette , beef and typical european vegetables is for me french influence on viet gastronomy ( and not french gastronomy ) , and it 's the same thing for tikka masala , it 's just british influence on indian/paki gastronomy . 
  i could ` nt agree more , you really understood perfectly the key differences between the two countries , pragmatism vs idealism , i note this . 
  have to admit that this is one of the best polandball comic . 
  yes , and nearly all `` chinese restaurant '' in france are owned by vietnamese that adapted some of their traditional recipe to the palate of french ( can confirm , i lived with a french vietnamese and they definitely have two versions of the same recipe , the restaurant for french adapted to french and their own version for their home , and they 're completely different ) . 
  i would definitely not integrate vietnamese food in the french gastronomy though . 
  well when you have to cite a indian recipe as an example of good british meal , there 's definitely a problem  . 
   population , size , army , economy , cultural power , empire , geographical proximity , cuisine , ... ok for everything but ... 
  if you finally admit that the official language of europe is french and let the english be the language of the usa , it 's ok  . 
  the viking invasions were in 790 . 
  the normandy begin to exist more than one century after , in 911 , and the duke of normandy was clearly a vassal of the king of france . 
  you ca n't seriously consider that all the duchies of france were not france , this is a nonsense . 
  the conquest of england is again one century later , and there was nothing `` viking '' in norman culture : same language than france , vassal of the king of france , same religion than france ( christianism ) , more than 2 centuries of genetic mixing with french ( and viking did n't replace the whole population in the first place , as the normans did n't replace all the people of britanny with the invasion of william ) . 
  you can believe what you want , but it was pretty clear that normandy was a duchy of france , a duchy that became very powerful with the conquest of england and began to be a rival after this event . 
  this is clear if you read wikipedia about what is considered as the kingdom of france : `` the division of france between the angevin ( plantagenet ) kings of england and the capetian kings of france would lead to the hundred years ' war '' . 
  sorry , but every historian knows that the hundred years ' war was actually a war between two french families and that the notion of england as a country began to appear only after this war and its resolution . 
  england was really french , with all the nobility speaking exactly the same french than france ( the language and culture was actually even closer that what you could find in county of toulouse and the rest of southern france with `` lenga d'oc '' ) . 
  so fucking boring . 
  sing in romanian for fuck sake . 
  both . 
  i like the clear syllables and the flat tone . 
  it 's one of the few language where i can distinguish the words and can repeat a sentence . 
   i really think that turkish is a lovely language but nevertheless its an irrelevant language due to no colonies there are no irrelevant languages , nothing is more relevant than diversity . 
  japanese . 
  i also like french accent on any non-french language , specially for girls . 
  russian is also so sexy . 
  i particularly dislike american english for girls , it sounds so vulgar and not feminine at all ( uk english is ok ) . 
   this is common knowledge , they are never referred to as french , but instead , normans normands is also the name of present french people living in normandie , the actual region of france today . 
  you should try opening an atlas sometimes . 
  well , you just said that people from british origin in america are not british but american . 
  so yo could agree with the fact that people from viking origin in france are not viking , but french . 
  be consistent . 
   william the ** conqueror ** , who was not ** french ** , but ** norman ** , who were ** originally ** norsemen hence the ** name ** norman . 
  normandy was not ** part ** of france , and neither was william the ** conqueror ** the king of france at the ** time ** . 
  hilighted words from french origin . 
  but yeah , if you want , he was not french , just a normand living in france and speaking french . 
  i really like the stereotype that french are always on strike . 
  this is our french revolution heritage , a deep rebel nature , a warning for the dominants that you ca n't abuse of french because they will be culturally the first to react strongly . 
   i see the neo-napoleons do n't tell them our plan please ... 
  germany is the economic leader of the eu , france the political and military leader . 
  great couple . 
   also as of 2016 the french military is weaker than the british ( i assume you are implying the opposite from your comment about an aircraft carrier ) . 
  here is the source . 
  uk is number 5 and france is number 6 ( scroll down slightly and look to the right for the top 10 list ) . 
  the nuclear power is not taken into account in this ranking ( and seriously , ultimately , this is the most important thing ) . 
  and sorry , but france is better than uk for this : http://www.worldblaze.in/top-10-nuclear-power-countries-in-the-world/2/ . 
   not to mention the uk has a close network of powerful political allies around the world please , do n't be ridiculous . 
  france is the country the most spread around the world : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_time_zones_by_country . 
  also , the biggest maritime territory of the world : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/exclusive_economic_zone#france from a geostrategic point of view , uk is a dwark compared to this , france does n't need `` political allies around the world '' , france is around the world . 
  sorry for you that you did n't manage to keep your empire , but the common wealth club is pretty ridiculous compared to have the only remaining country on which the sun never set . 
  welcome to 2016 . 
   but the vietnamese choosing to speak english over french has benefits of its own , like being to communicate with trade partners more easily . 
  true . 
  never said that it was a nonsense switch . 
   moving away from english to french or german has no such benefits . 
  false . 
  nigeria is surrounded by francophone country ( they have other languages , but the common lingua franca of western africa is de facto french ) and is moving more and more toward french to not be completely isolated . 
  they recently joined the iof ( international organisation of francophonie , http://www.channelstv.com/2012/12/12/nigeria-to-join-organisation-of-french-speaking-countries/ ) and promoted french as the 2nd national language ( http://www.antimoon.com/forum/t15459.htm ) . 
   their lack of knowledge on the eu is hardly the uk 's fault . 
  never said that it 's the uk 's fault . 
  i just said that if brexit happen , people would ` nt care and nothing will change . 
  i said slightly . 
  for my wife , it 's not slightly , because she 's a french with vietnamese descent ( keep in mind that there is a large vietnamese community in france ) , she only speaks french perfectly ( she can speak viet and english , but badly ) and can not communicate perfectly with a part of her family . 
  they 're from the same family , but like strangers . 
  i feel the same with the arabisation of algeria ( have algeria ancestry ) , i do n't speak a single word of arab , but hopefully algeria still speak a lot french . 
  i would be really sad if they switch to english . 
  imagine a american of irish ancestry with english being more and more replaced by chinese or german . 
  how do you think he will feel ? 
  well vietnam is not anymore part of france , but the fact that they switch from french to english as a second language annoy me ( slightly ) . 
  would be ok for any other language , but not english ( this old rivalry ... ) . 
  the whole continent united and speaking french ( will not happen ) would be the dream of napoleon , can you imagine how butthurt the brits would be ? 
  no he 's completely right . 
  in france , some people are surprised by the brexit , because most people did n't even know that the uk were in the eu . 
  the cameron drama is so ridiculous , threating a brexit while it 's not obvious for the rest of the world that you 're in eu in the first place ... 
  believe me , in france , we sometimes blame germany for eu decisions , but uk , lol , why blaming you ? 
  you clearly overestimate the attention that the continentals give you . 
  i do n't understand a single word of german , but would be ok for french and german ( or just german , i do n't mind ) just to see the face of brits .

  i already made my original point . 
  no new bureaucrats non handling things . 
  the constitutional court in france , judge are chosen by politicians , and ex-presidents can siege . 
  great , it 's the season to rip some shirts . 
   dnc hack survivor you must fucking shitting me . 
  * check the profile *  always : feminism , coffee , minnesota , brunch ho i see . 
   blame it on us . 
  i am the only one that read `` blame it on u.s '' ? 
  russian trolling , best trolling . 
  france , just few time ago refuse to deliver boats to russia , and they brag about it . 
  i got so many examples that our government ca n't even took the moral high ground . 
  and what about that public statement ? 
  are we doing diplomacy like the germans now ? 
  or the americans ? 
  this is grotesque . 
  you see that kind of behaviors ? 
  `` you were commies , now take the crumbs and be grateful '' . 
  that 's the pro macron legions , and they do the same approach with poor people here.this condescending way of doing things . 
   we are frustrated to hear that the funds are suddenly used as a tool of political pressure or it has been all along the case and you just realize it . 
  i tried to explain that to people . 
  an obvious statement that need to be remembered . 
   poland-bashing wo n't hurt macron at home if i may.the `` polish plumber '' taking the baguette from the mouth of the hardworking french was an issue some years ago . 
  and it is strongly associated with the ( hard ) right . 
  he 'll be the white knight of `` european values '' with merkel , shitting on the conservative government . 
  if this shit goes wrong and prevent cd project red to develop their next game , i 'll call for an international force to occupy poland . 
  for the greater good . 
  well people , this is democracy . 
  people screaming at each others , pretending to be the sacred guardians of the constitution , etc. 
  de gaulle called the parliamentarians the `` loudmouthed '' , doing the exact same behavior just like before the war . 
  i think poslish are reasonable people . 
  it 's gon na be all right . 
  p.s : it 's still a thing to call each other `` comrade '' ? 
  or it 's a bad translation ? 
   pending the investigation , russia 's consumer protection agency advised parents who do buy the toy for their children to only buy it from authorized sellers well , that 's just prevention . 
   it 's like they learned nothing from the cold war . 
  i think they do n't give a shit about other seeing their movies and buying their cars . 
  they never have , and probably never will . 
  their day to day interest is to hold their huge country together , like the chinese and india . 
  just remember , they got the nuclear bomb 11 years before we did . 
  so if they want shit , they get it . 
  damn turks . 
  ho shit that press x in the middle of a fucking cinematic . 
  this behavior is not dead yet . 
  yo , long temps pas vu . 
  ha fuck . 
  well , we get rid of our king , was easier to do that than understand your german stuff . 
   these states employed relatively large mercenary armies , and the war became less about religion and more of a continuation of the france -- habsburg rivalry for european political pre-eminence . 
  the hate of the prussians is stronger than a 2 000 years old faith . 
  i already knew about that , and i 'm cultivating it in my country for a good reason . 
  it 's always a problem when you ask a soldier to kill foreigners who believe in the same super magic power as you . 
  it slows them for their jobs.give them second thoughts . 
  ca n't have that . 
  you explain how coffee went to spread to the population ( reminds me the introduction of chocolate in european courts ) . 
  but why the product coffee in the first place ? 
  was is a merchant who had opportunities to buy big for cheap , was an aristocrats who started the hype . 
  or just a whole population who prefers a distinctive taste than another ? 
  ( laughing in french ), 
  it 's a `` software '' problem , they say . 
  de gaulle was like that too . 
  not a big fan of public insubordination . 
  but he was a military man . 
  what 's sweetface excuse ? 
   bs patriotic nonsense ho , i start to see now . 
  you are like all these vegans who pretend to care about the animals , but they just want you to not eat meat . 
  he is a well respected technician and historian of the military . 
  again , it is not the tread about the opportunity of an intervention somewhere , it 's about money . 
  we 'll have many other occasion to talk bout that in the future . 
  as this map seems shitposting , it raises an interesting question . 
  as you can make a strong link between ex colonies productions , why italy or other choose a product more than another ? 
  what are the true influences ? 
  ps : country on the est , choose a goddamn side . 
  we did not killed them all . 
  some where allies in the revolution , helped us crushed the foreign invaders . 
  and the military family is strong among them.the catholic faith too , unfortunately . 
  a myth talk numerous time by pierre servant , the presentator of france 2 every year for le d\u00e9fil\u00e9 militaire du 14 juillet . 
  and a regular expert on france 5 . 
  you should write them . 
  and maybe the budget cuts , the unforeseen war in libya may have , maybe something to do with it . 
  as our troop are now begging for fucking yankee 's planes to transport them in africa . 
  and then you talking about the place to go , that absolutely not the debate about the budget and what we were talking about . 
   footprint are we talking global warming here ? 
  do you known how many country in europe can intervene anywhere in the world in less than 24 hours ? 
  two , uk and france . 
  and the rosbif are gone to the larger shores , it 's just us . 
  i would gladly brag about that all day long , but unfortunately for me , i have informations within the army that role can not be fulfill at its best capacities . 
  i do n't give a shit where the money is from , that line or that line in the budget ( and the politicians do n't either when they distribute their gifts to their friends ) . 
  i want the soldiers , and the gears well prepared for their missions . 
  i remember the first time i saw putin on the news , it was its introduction to the world as prime minister . 
  he was next to this huge boris guy , venerate in the west to avoid a bloodbath in his country . 
  and i thought `` well what a contrast '' , what can that little guy can do ? 
  is he really in charge , or they find some accounting in a back office somewhere ? 
  here years later , while europe is in a semi chaos , this vlad knows where he is from , where he is , and where he wants to go . 
  they were cutting the military budget for years now . 
  instead of maintaining it . 
  and to go back to the previous situation , it will not cost that we spare , ho no . 
  it will cost much , much more . 
  these worthless politicians scumbags . 
  the intelligence agencies were still set as they were fighting communist spies . 
  ai n't no commies who shoot down bourgeois like ducks in the fairground . 
  this general position seems `` courageous '' , but it ai n't .

  yes , also it 's worth noting that hitler had some kind of obsession for paris and was particularly mad that it was intact . 
  his idea was that berlin should become the `` new '' paris , so when he saw berlin getting completely destroyed , while paris was still there standing untouched , despite being under german control for years , he could n't accept the idea that his dream would never come true and thought that the french did n't deserve the city so it should be destroyed like berlin . 
  thanks to von choltitz and nordling 's amazing diplomatic skills it did not happen . 
  hitler was completely insane at the end and many of his collaborators realised it , no doubt about that . 
  still , he had a lot of them who remained loyals to him until the end . 
  hell , the war would have ended a lot earlier if it was n't the case . 
  also , refusing to carry the order meant von choltitz 's wife and children were going to get a bullet in the head , as hitler ordered for all officers who refused to obey him . 
  actually hitler gave the order to destroy paris , bombs had been placed in the louvre , the eiffel tower , on every bridge and all major sites in the city , but dietrich von choltitz , the german governor of paris during the occupation , refused to carry the order . 
  it was the swedish ambassador in paris , raoul nordling , who convinced him that destroying one of the most beautiful city in the world would bring nothing to anyone , and that it would just be a loss for humanity . 
  if you 're interested [ there is a very nice french-german movie on this called * diplomacy * , ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/diplomacy_%282014_film%29 ) it is basically the conversations between von choltitz and nordling before the free french get to paris and how the latter convinced the former not to destroy paris . 
  daesh blew up saudis as well and considers the gulf monarchies as one of their main targets . 
  it does n't mean they have no sympathizers in qatar or saudi arabia . 
  i 'm not comparing turkey to these countries , i know they are completely different , but you ca n't deny there are 2 turkey : the one tourists see in istanbul and the much , much conservative in smaller cities and rural areas . 
  and everywhere islamists started making non-violent demands such as banning alcohol or pornography , the violence is always what comes next . 
  see algeria in the early 90s . 
  this is always a small minority that is deemed irrelevant , until this small group completely fuck up the entire country . 
  [ that is not the first time for putin . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvlfqxfriuq ), 
   the germans were unable to move supplies and reinforcements fast enough to maintain their advance . 
  the fast-moving stormtroopers leading the attack could not carry enough food and ammunition to sustain themselves for long and all the german offensives petered out , in part through lack of supplies . 
   ** by late april 1918 , the danger of a german breakthrough had passed . 
  ** the german army had suffered heavy casualties and now occupied ground of dubious value which would prove impossible to hold with such depleted units . 
   ** in august 1918 ** , the allies began a counter-offensive with the support of 1 -- 2 million fresh american troops and using new artillery techniques and operational methods . 
  and that 's the introduction of the link you gave , did you even read it ? 
  the american troops did n't save anybody , they helped during the counter-offensive that ultimately lead to germany 's defeat . 
   citations , how do they work !? 
  no idea what you mean . 
   open forums , how do they work ?!, 
  that was still quite pathetic my friend . 
  a link to a comment from an indian student on quora really ? 
  also , browsing my history to reply to a comment on another thread is quite pathetic . 
  that 's complete crap . 
  [ wwi was the beginning of the us ' rise as a world power . 
  ] ( http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/how-world-war-i-helped-america-rise-to-superpower-status-a-944703.html )  the us 's entry into the war in 1917 marked the beginning of its path to becoming a world power . 
  in fact , according to historian herfried m\u00fcnkler , this was precisely the goal of some politicians in washington . 
  treasury secretary william gibbs mcadoo , a son-in-law of president woodrow wilson , was already forging plans to replace the pound sterling with the dollar as the foremost international reserve currency . 
  even the dollar was pretty much irrelevant internationally before wwi . 
  i know where all of this come from , i studied us history quite extensively as i said later in the original conversation . 
  i was just saying that all this would never be accepted in france . 
  it was n't a criticism or anything , just a remark on how we have a different interpretation of what secularism is . 
  well as i said , it was a very sneaky law and it was not mentionned officially that the target was the burqa . 
  but i think you 're right and it would not have passed in the us . 
  it 's true , we have quite an `` extreme '' view on what securalism should be . 
  just one thing though , the burqa ban is not a burqa ban , it 's a law that makes it illegal to have the face covered on the street , there is no mention of a religious covering being illegal . 
  of course it was aimed at women wearing burqa but also at people wearing masks and throwing stones at the police in protests . 
  this is why the european court of human rights validated the law and said it was not a violation of religious freedom . 
  i studied american history in university and what you said about putting god everywhere during the cold war is spot on . 
  mccarthyism and the hysteria that came with it really did harm secularism in the us . 
  it 's a very sneaky way to put pressure on anybody who 's not religious or christian . 
  like , `` you do n't have to say the pledge or say ` under god ' , but you 'll have to face the consequences . '', 
  imagine if clinton does n't use a bible , some people would get absolutely mental . 
  right now we have a big debate on secularism in france . 
  the whole idea was to destroy or limit the church 's influence , but now it 's more about how do we deal with muslims and islam who demand a lot . 
  yeah culturally speaking a majority would say christian , but not religiously . 
  while this is correct that church and state are seperated , the us is a really special country . 
  from the `` in god we trust '' on every dollar bill to your president taking oath on the bible , you have a very weird interpretation of what is secularism from a french point of view . 
  actually a majority of our population defines itself as non-religious or atheist . 
  yeah i just checked and i have no idea where op got these numbers . 
   well then let 's have a confederation of independent nations instead of a federation of european states . 
  the eu is neither a confederation or a federation . 
   that way our countries are n't run by brussels , but we still get to act together in relation to usa , china and russia . 
  our countries are n't ran by brussels , and the eu is specifically what allows us to act together in relation to the us or china . 
  indeed , symbolically it 's quite something . 
  yeah we 're the country that relies the most on nuclear energy on the planet . 
  now you understand why our government quickly deploys troops when some jihadists decide to sneak around places that provide a lot of uranium to us . 
  i ca n't speak for everybody but i know that in france it 's a legal problem . 
  if a woman wants to get surgery to become a man , she just has to go to a doctor . 
  but if she wants to become legally recognized as a man , she needs to get sterilization because she could get pregnant , which is biologically impossible for a man . 
  and a kid could end up with 2 mothers or 2 fathers . 
  so that 's roughly the justification from judges , it would pose a problem on the legal definition of what is a man or a woman . 
  in my opinion this is a completely outdated view , especially since we legalized gay marriage and adoption . 
  a kid can already legally have 2 mothers or 2 fathers . 
  those are 2 articles are about oil drilling in libya by total , how is it related to us shale gas ? 
  how did we get punished under cdg ? 
  can we join ? 
  it sounded fun the first time but we did n't get the invitation :(, 
  hey by no means i wanted to undermine the essential role the us played in wwii , just saying what i ( and other people ) have experienced . 
  of course this is an uneducated minority , but so far i have n't seen this with brits or russians . 
   in the western popular imagination -- particularly the american one -- world war ii is a conflict we won . 
  not particularly , ** only ** the american . 
  and do n't get me wrong , people in france remember the american soldiers who bravely delivered us ( along with british , canadian and other nations ' soldiers ) , and their sacrifice is learned by every single french kid in school , but i 've only heard americans claiming they won alone wwii . 
  you do know that [ the dgse has already a massive surveillance system as well ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/frenchelon ) and basically listens and intercepts pretty much all the communications going in/out of france right ? 
  exactly , you summed it up very well . 
  not so long ago i read an article on this topic and a former dgse senior officer was basically saying that the difference between different agencies are huge . 
  french , british and germans are historically very active and are ready to act `` agressively '' if needed so , whereas this is the opposite for swedes or belgians who would act more `` softly '' . 
  collaboration is possible , but the differences between services means they would never agree on how to act . 
   populists getting protest votes ? 
  they are n't going to win any national election , le pen is a joke . 
  yeah , they just won a european election , but winning a national election ? 
  unthinkable . 
  by the way the `` joke '' multiplied by 11 its number of elected representatives nationwide , from 181 in 2012 to 1 992 in 2015 . 
  since 2007 they multiplied by 12 the number of their militants , people who actually pay money to be part of the party , from 7 000 to 83 000 . 
  no one is laughing but you moron . 
   such as ? 
  i do n't know , pis in poland or orb\u00e1n and his lovely fidesz-mpsz in hungary ... do you read news sometimes ? 
   no , i 'm saying that the vast majority of people will never have the time to even begin to understand the complexities of leaving or joining something like the eu . 
  that 's exactly what i said : `` people should n't vote because they 're too stupid '' . 
   and grow up before you next reply . 
  nice argument . 
   but simple put , brexit is n't really going to happen are you a soothsayer ?

  considering the current situation in france you can bet at least that much since then . 
  yeah but without throwing that strawman in the first paragraph this article would be less convincing . 
  painting your target as a nazi sympathizers is an always effective tactic . 
   mosques are defaced . 
  synagogues are protected by soldiers . 
  * that * 's what the majority of muslims actually complain about . 
  any group attacking the jews is swiftly and severely punished , and rightly so . 
  but groups like the `` ligue de d\u00e9fense juive '' , which is considered a terrorist group in the usa , can commit violent acts against muslims without repercussions . 
  after the charlie hebdo shooting hundreds of muslims were attacked , culpable by association . 
  they deserve the same protection as anyone else . 
  the current prime minister manuel valls pledged allegiance to the jewish community , publicly , wearing a kippa and all , at the time he was interior minister . 
  french laicity is applied differently to muslims and jews , that is a fact , and that is injust . 
  that 's interesting that france would be one of the signatories knowing that in 2010 the justice minister mich\u00e8le alliot-marie wrote a memo to all prosecutors ordering them to systematically prosecute anyone calling for the boycott of israeli products on the basis of `` incitement to racial discrimination '' . 
  as far as i know this order is still valid today and people are arrested once in a while on that basis . 
  people think it 's funny to ridicule rms despite everything he did for the open source community . 
  but when you look at for example android vs. debian , the difference * is * meaningful , linux without the unix tools and without the standard system structure is not really `` linux '' . 
  not to mention that a large part of google 's magic is the amount of info they have collected about everyone , the algorithm alone is only part of the puzzle . 
  google has offices in paris , so they are subject to french jurisdiction . 
  were such a law to be voted ( there is no such law , the article seems in large part made up ) then google would have to comply with it like any entity present on french soil . 
  this article seems to take its source from [ this financial times article ] ( http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/643f49ec-e285-11e4-aa1d-00144feab7de.html ) claiming that the french senate is set to adopt a law this week forcing google to publish their algorithm . 
  to the best of my knowledge there is no such law being currently examined by the senate or national assembly . 
  this article is based on incorrect information . 
  this article is incorrect , they only stopped with google news spain , not search . 
  and after that spanish newspapers have n't actually experienced the dramatic change in traffic people predicted . 
  it 's just the same as before ( edit : actually [ -2 % to -12 % ] ( http://www.thesempost.com/aede-spains-assoc-newspaper-editors-claims-12-drop-traffic-closure-google-news/ ) ) . 
  belgium has much lower taxes for rich individuals than france . 
  what makes you so sure it ca n't happen ? 
  your sentence is a logical contradiction . 
  oh wow i believed in this one . 
  silly me thinking our dear leaders would do anything to defend the interest of the individuals over the power of money . 
  i was replying to neurostat who brought up the subject of consensual sex with pets , and i explained why such concept does not make sense . 
  i did n't say or know if such a thing would be needed . 
  `` consensual '' means with ( mutual ) consent . 
  i guess one could argue that the psychological harm is significant in this case . 
  if there is no harm done , physical nor psychological , then there is no reason to ban the practice . 
  the problem is , like a child , an animal can not generally give his consent . 
  no , abuse does not mean murder . 
  in france similarly there are no specific laws against bestiality ( we tend to avoid laws purely based on moral judgments ) , but it falls , and has been prosecuted , under the definition of animal abuse . 
  i do n't believe that being competitive is an end to itself . 
  if the result is lower wages , then it is a loss for the average citizen , whatever say the current economic dogma and the german government . 
  at least in some countries the employment office cuts your benefits it you refuse more than a certain amount of job offers . 
  i fear that , for example a french person looking for a job might get its benefit cut if he refuses a job in poland for half the french minimum wage . 
  i see two problems with this : * people from low-wage countries taking jobs in higher-wage countries , thereby lowering the average wage of said countries with potentially bad consequences for the overall workforce . 
  * employment offices imposing jobs in other european countries to the jobless with potentially low wages or the need to move . 
  and in france a candidate for presidency needs 500 `` sponsorships '' from already elected officials to be allowed to participate in the elections , officially to prevent abuse . 
  you 're not the only ones to have barriers to entry . 
  i do n't see how this idea of a non-apartheid state would work . 
  it would only make it easier for israel to park and spoliate the palestinians . 
  what the europeans back , and what their governments back are two entirely separate things . 
  being a rural/manufacturing area does n't necessarily determine the vote . 
  i 'd say that generally industrial areas that are declining vote left because they turn to the state for help , while areas that do well vote to the right to protect their personal interests . 
  i think you also get a striking and interesting result if you correlate the [ age groups map ] ( http://www.lefigaro.fr/assets/flash/cevipof/carte-presidentielle-cevipof-1.jpg ) with the [ vote results map ] ( http://www.trop-libre.fr/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/vote-rural.jpg ) . 
  why are the leftmost candidates automatically dismissed without argument ? 
  to me m\u00e9lenchon seemed like the objectively best candidate for the last elections ... 
  not really , far right political tendencies are an [ old french tradition ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/national_front_%28france%29 ) . 
  from a purely practical point of view having a single common language , and a simple and easily extensible one like english is a very good idea . 
  however this is not all there is to it . 
  whenever you start using a language in schools , it becomes dominant . 
  that 's what we did in france with our local dialects . 
  they remained strong until one day the government made french the mandatory language in schools . 
  most dialects basically died within one generation . 
  language is not only a means to transfer information , but also carries a whole lot of cultural references and history of the people which speaks it . 
  it probably is because i 'm french , but i believe that the language is what defines a people , not the nationality . 
  movies , books , songs , poems , plays , etc. 
  all need a specific language to be expressed and understood , and if you translate them you have will always lose something however talented the translator is . 
  thats the main danger i think , and why many people including me do n't think that 's a good idea . 
  nothing new about this . 
  this has been an argument against the euro from the start , the most developed economies would crush the less developed ones in an open market . 
  and indeed they did to an extent , the commercial balance of most countries have worsened , while the strongest economy of the zone , germany , has improved . 
  it 's easy for germany now to tell the others that they should make efforts to reach their level , ignoring the mathematical fact that the sum of all commercial balances is zero , and that most exchanges of goods are made inside the eurozone . 
  there are certainly a lot of people with interests in the matter , banks come to mind . 
  in any case the reforms should be a means , not an end . 
  if it stifles growth it 's counter-productive . 
  the ** dogma ** of austerity put forth by the imf and germany is going to kill these countries . 
  look what 's going on in greece : between 2011 and 2012 under pressure of the troika they lowered their budget by a huge amount , as a result the gdp has tanked , and the debt is still rising . 
  they still ca n't repay it , and a new 2-year respite has just been granted by the eu . 
  in two years they will have not less debt but more , who can believe they can repay it then ? 
  some people just refuse to accept the fact that austerity creates poverty and that you ca n't sacrifice a whole population to pay the interests of the debt to your rich neighbors . 
  neighbors who are rich because they could dump they products in the eu market . 
  they are right to fight . 
  right . 
  and they should stay home as well , so as not to inconvenience the other more orderly citizens . 
  i believe the parliament gets to vote on all treaties . 
  i have high hope that the parliament will follow suit of its decision on acta and reject this treaty favoring almost exclusively the interests of the north-american content industry . 
  you 're right , that 's why there should be a strong public effort towards education . 
  educated people are more likely to think by themselves rationally , and less likely to be manipulated . 
  an educated people is also less easy to rule ... 
  i believe all religions should die . 
  they have been - and today maybe more than ever - causing an amazing amount of damage to the world . 
  nothing against islam specifically . 
  there are [ a lot of studies ] ( https://www.google.fr/search?q=impact+immigration+sur+l'\u00e9conomie ) available online . 
  nothing insane about that . 
  studies have shown that the net impact of immigrants on economy is neutral to positive , so bringing in more immigrants makes sense . 
  the reason the right wing is opposing immigration so strongly is purely ideological . 
  i think it 's more complicated than that . 
  you ca n't alter the variables independently . 
  raising tax levels reduces competitiveness , which in turn lowers gdp , which ultimately reduces tax revenue . 
  also some people could argue that balancing the budget is not a worthy goal in itself . 
  debt can be controlled by other means , like economic growth , inflation , devaluation , etc. 
  like you said , tax level is only one of the factors to competitiveness .

  it depends , for french phone network providers you usually could use your phone for almost nothing in the uk , germany , spain and italy . 
  it wo n't change that much . 
  casinos are legal but not that common , betting is legal too . 
  cock fights are legal in northern france because it is part of their tradition too . 
  looks good enough though . 
  my university 's football ground does not have grass on it . 
  for twenty euros i can travel 150km north of my hometown . 
  that 's pretty much what i pay when i go from my parent 's town to the city where i study . 
  and they 're all in the same region . 
  wolves and bears in the pyrenees , several types of vipers , scorpions and asian hornets in the south . 
  talking about it at home is not forbidden , you can do whatever the fuck you want , just you ca n't post about it in newspaper , you can not distribute papers about your candidate or make posters . 
  it is not outdated , simply as every other law , they can be broken . 
  people of social media will talk about it but they can be sued if they do it . 
  i like germany as every other european country , we 're a big family now , it 's just that i do n't share merkel 's views on how a country should be runned . 
  how can you like him personnally ? 
  you met him ? 
  from which point are we considered as a polyglot ? 
  i mean , i speak 4 languages and i would n't consider myself as one because i know few people who speak 5,6 or even seven languages . 
  yeah , that 's the closest thing we have to porco dio , i 'd love to have a french porco dio . 
  italian cursewords are so good . 
  sometimes i say `` putain de dieu '' which is basically the same as `` porco dio '' i believe . 
  fuck them both . 
  i absolutely love talking to foreigners living here . 
  their accent when they try to speak french is so cute . 
  they have no confederation , meaning that they can not take part in official competitions like euro or world cup . 
  i 'm from southern french coast so of course i will die if you get me somewhere where it rains more than once a month or gets under 10 \u00b0 c in winter . 
  depends where you live i guess . 
  where i live there are no poles , a little bit of portuguese , italians and spanish but mostly people from maghreb . 
  algerians , definetely . 
  stop interfering and fucking up with middle east maybe ? 
  what we already did should give us refugees for at least half the century , maybe if we stop now we could be good by the year 2050 or more . 
  yeah , i missunderstood sorry . 
   2 ) egalit\u00e9 & r\u00e9conciliation ( equality and reconciliation ) are mainly and antisemites antisionists ( lol ) please it 's clearly not the same . 
   lots of airlines offer drinks and snacks though not low cost companies  did you perhaps feel better because they speak french ? 
  i speak 4 languages , mate . 
  also on long flights the food is actually quite good . 
  the chef who runs the factories where they produce the food we eat up there is like three stars on the michelin . 
  air france is an extremely good company for me . 
  sure it 's expensive but everytime i had flights with them the crew was amazing and you always have a drink and a snack offered which is nice . 
  they can be larger than most european capitals , there is probably a reason why no one knows them . 
  a lot of big cities in china are big because they are working towns . 
  there 's absolutely no particular sign of culture or whatsoever . 
  also most people do n't know the names of chinese towns because we decided to change them . 
  canton is supposed to be called guangzhou or something like that . 
  train is really expensive in europe . 
  flights are much cheaper . 
  last year it was down the road because i lived in a small appartment . 
  now it is in my cellar because i moved to a three bedroom appartment with friends . 
  hard life i guess . 
  they 're having it much worse than the rest of us . 
  the housing is expensive as fuck to the point that some people who have jobs have to live in their car . 
  everything is damn expensive because of tourists , the weather is extremely unpredictable and most of the time it is grey with a chance of rain . 
  the tourists also make public transports really slow because they move slowly compared to true parisians . 
  considering all that , i kind of understand why they tend to have absolutely no chill . 
  i do n't know about latin , but hebrew and ancient greek are classics in almost every french university, 
  north - inbred people and alcoholics south - lazy people corsica - mafia britanny - alcoholics paris - assholes, 
  the exact opposite happens too . 
  when i go to spain every fucking time the waiter realizes i 'm french so he speaks french to me . 
  dude , i speak spanish and catalan , i just want to practice it sometimes !, 
  yes , they are mostly from the indignados, 
  spanish constitution does not allow such a referendum , nor does it allow a region to secede from it . 
  yeah , arabic is tough , probably some of the toughest language on par with russian and chinese . 
  but i like the fact that some words in french come from arabic and also that we still add some of them . 
  in europe a close call between spanish and italian , non-european probably arabic . 
  yeah i know , we sorta do well , but i ca n't remember the last time we won, 
  some said he was antisemitic, 
  my country never does good at eurovision but this year , i 'm all for moldova . 
  they bring back the epic sax guy . 
  no one gives a shit about it . 
  pasta with marinated chicken : 500g of your favorite type of pasta ( i prefer small ones like farfalle for example ) 2 chicken breasts 2 red bellpeppers honey , pepper , salt , curry , paprika , olive oil , soy sauce ( the salty type , not the sweet ) , garlic and onion . 
  start by cutting your chicken in relatively small dices in order to make it faster to cook and easier to marinate . 
  then you put it in a bowl , soak it in soy sauce , add olive oil , honey to your appreciation , crush a garlic in it , add the spices previously listed until it has a nice color and smell . 
  salt and pepper ( as always ) . 
  let it marinade overnight . 
  cook your pasta . 
  dice your bellpeppers or cut them into thin strips , cook it in olive oil until it gets softer , add your chicken and the marinade . 
  cook the whole thing until the chicken gets a nice color but not too much , otherwise it gets dry !, 
  add all that to your pasta et voil\u00e0 !, 
  for the cost , the chicken cost me 6 $ , the bellpeppers around 2 $ , 0.50 $ for the pasta and i do n't really know how much the spices cost but the spices and the soy sauce might be the `` expensive '' part of this dish . 
  then they should definetely , maupassant and celine 's work are considered to be some of the finest pieces of french litterature even though celine is a big controversial . 
  [ this one ] ( https://www.ecb.europa.eu/euro/coins/comm/shared/img/joint_comm_2009_belgium.jpg ) because it looks like a 4 year old designed it . 
  i had one once , and i genuinely believed that it was a fake coin . 
  are n't most of these classics in litterature in general or is it just for us ? 
  well , i did some research as a part of one of my courses in uni and i found out that most mediterranean countries used pretty much the same ingredients when cooking food , have a lot of history in common for example , spain with morocco , france with algeria and lebanon , italy with tunisia and libya etc. . . 
  i believe that there are more coherent culture in common between the mediterranean countries than there is between all the countries in europe itself . 
  i feel closer to the maghreb than to nordic countries for example . 
  morocco only has a small part of its shores in the mediterranean , most of it is atlantic ocean . 
  well it was dt 's decision though . 
  and he said it would be a bad idea to attack syria not that long ago . 
  i followed the election and i study american govt and politics and i believe that trump was elected because of his isolationist ideas while clinton wanted the us to remain involved as the world 's peacemaker . 
  it might be a bit dissappointing to his supporters now . 
  well at least for an international agreement , it is very likely that most western governments would have supported the strikes . 
   he should have waited for the investigation results . 
  he should have waited for the fucking un to decide for something to do . 
  just because he did it alone without letting us know before doing it , i would not follow them in this war . 
  and basque country, 
  well , technically , marine le pen wants to put borders back because we have no borders since schengen so i would say she is indeed advocating for border changes . 
  not only on the economic side , there were open conflict with azerbaijan last year iirc . 
   automatic transmission wow , you guys drive automatic ? 
  til,

  this is a convenient way to censor merkel 's handling of the refugee crisis . 
  any article mentioning it could be construed as refugee-hating . 
  just in time for the elections . 
  i would ' t say nice . 
  damn . 
  and to say that they were to reform and enter the eu . 
  the accession process , albeit moribund/stalled , has still not been officially killed . 
  the important thing here is the author :  denis haveaux is director of the red cross eu office i 'm very glad of this coming to senses , instead of this ferry service . 
  props to denis haveaux !, 
   of europe i beg to differ . 
  and people say turkey is anti-lgbt, 
  * how turkey revealed its true nature and values . 
  you 're not understanding backpropagation . 
  let 's make it simple . 
  -- say a = b. 
  a goes down means b goes down as well . 
  -- say a = b + c . a goes down means b + c goes down as well . 
  it means at least one of b or c must go down . 
  but one can remain constant or even go up . 
  -- a is the immigration being fucked up . 
  b and c are the expression of power of 2 different entities . 
  in the a = b scenario , b ca n't escape responsibility . 
  in the a = b + c scenario , b can escape responsibility to some extent . 
  the important thing here being `` to some extent '' . 
  c ca n't take the hit for so long . 
  b fears to some extent fucking up . 
  a = b + c is representative democracy . 
  in our situation we have b = d + e + f ( juncker negotiates with each government over a single decision ) , and d = g + h + i ( juncker in his initial election had to please each government and the parliament ) , and g = j + k + l ( each government got elected over a range of concerns ) now , by the power of ' + ' being associative , we have : a = b + c + ... + g + h + i + j + k + l + ... + z. 
  and b can do whatever the fuck it wants , as the fuckups can be amply diluted and directed across a vast supply of other participants . 
  in other words : excuses . 
  you 're saying `` buuut theyy 're aaall eleeected '' . 
  yes they are . 
  responsibility dispatch has way to many pathways , though . 
  and accountability - which is the ' = ' constraint operator here - is powerless . 
  simple enough ? 
   you live in a representative democracy , just like i said , you did n't read . 
  what i 'm saying is we are not even in a representative democracy , and you are not addressing that . 
  we would if juncker did not take orders from votes from our governments . 
  instead , the fuckup backpropagation has to go through 4 levels instead of one . 
  how blind can you be ? 
  get off your high level view and count the number of times a vote has to ** serially ** take place before it affects immigration : * my vote in the presidential election , with the other vote over other concerns . 
  * french government shorlists juncker . 
  with negotiation with other governments over other concerns . 
  +1 indirection . 
  * juncker must please the european parliament too , and on other concerns . 
  dilution of concerns . 
  +1 indirection . 
  * negotiation over issues takes place at the commission , drowned in other concerns too . 
  +1 indirection . 
  why not stop at the first one ? 
  you have to understand that elections yield power , and the dual backprogation through this power means that when power fucks up you can trace it back to someone in charge , and how he is elected . 
  if you try to backpropagate the migrant crisis you have the following indirection of responsibility : * it could have been that the commission could not act because some other country did n't feel like it because they wanted to negotiate another point . 
  * it could have been that the parliament was elected on other concerns . 
  * it could have been that the french government just did n't want someone powerful enough at the helm of the commission . 
  also someone who pleases germany and other countries too . 
  * now we get to me , and i cast my vote on the french government . 
  ** tl ; dr ** : for each level in an election there is a mean to escape responsibility . 
  and there is 4 levels between the electorate and juncker . 
  and he does n't even holds any real power . 
  the eu claims of being a democratic system is a complete and utter joke . 
  -- with this being said i am fully prepared to your blind handwaving of this and repeating without modification what you just wrote , / u/jtalin . 
  we 've had this discussion before . 
  juncker is the only one in the position to have stopped it . 
  but he does n't have power and he is elected through 5 levels of indirection . 
  tell me what i can do about that fuckup . 
  i am no greece or italian or german citizen . 
  yet it affects me . 
  calais is filling up again ; illegal camps are growing in my inner city . 
  i am not angry about other citizens not sharing my view . 
  i am angry i ca n't cast any vote over this issue . 
  ... at the moment . 
  voting sentiment can change over time . 
  an independent iraqi kurdistan will stay permanently , on the other hand . 
  what if the new president and barzani are not on good terms ? 
  oh wait , nevermind, 
  yeah . 
  which is why i do n't get turkey 's liking of iraqi kurdistan at all . 
  yes , it breaks up a neighbouring country . 
  hooray !, 
  but do n't you guys think about the effects on your own independentists ? 
  this is really retarded levels of dumb . 
   nobody wants uncontrolled migration and yet it has happened . 
  i 'm with you on the 1 ) . 
  not with you on the 3 ) . 
  -- truly , the benefit is to pressure part of the population into providing cheap labor . 
  low education immigrants will compete with low wage workers , and the wages will go further down . 
  georges j. borjas - a harvard professor - analyzes this phenomenon in his papers , and illustrates it with the effect the cuban mass immigration took on florida . 
  here is an article of his : http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/09/trump-clinton-immigration-economy-unemployment-jobs-214216 main highlight :  ** immigration redistributes wealth from those who compete with immigrants to those who use immigrants -- from the employee to the employer . 
  ** -- the only immigration that is worth having is the one actually capable of creating jobs : * phd in a booming sector * investor * serial , proven entrepreneur * prize winning specialist -- to go back on your 3 ) ; while i do not think the elites are of malicious intent , i do believe there is indeed a huge side effect on culture/way of life/liberties . 
  ghettos get created , terrorism will flourish . 
  i 'd argue the elites just do n't care . 
  about your 2 ) i do believe that politicians guilty of demographics-changing should be acted upon with the full force of high-treason laws . 
  even if it took place 50 years ago . 
  alright ; but would n't an independent iraqi kurdistan bolden the claim of the turkish kurds to fork off as well , to have their own referendum for independence from turkey ? 
  like germany reuniting , like northern ireland joining the south ? 
   nobody in turkey would care if iraqi kurdistan got independant and about turkish kurdistan ? 
   which fucking ferry service are you talking about ? 
  this ferry service : https://i.redd.it/32ttswuj034z.png  via the mediterranean and the balkan route without any eu help . 
  msf is publicly funded by the eu . 
  and they smuggle migrants .

  also i am not sure what you mean by `` earned '' . 
  not denying the fact that sikhs are well integrated in british society , but it has to be noticed that exceptions were made to better integrate them , such as laws on wearing helmets for instance . 
  let 's hope the dutch keep being in poor form . 
  arnica is available in much higher doses than homeopathic levels . 
  they were second of their pool in the qualifying rounds , which is not bad for a country that was not even a member of the international basketball federation a few years ago . 
  agreed . 
  many questions were so vague , i did not know if i agreed or disagreed . 
  being originally from montpellier and a rugby fan , i only know about [ gorgodzilla ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mamuka_gorgodze ) . 
  i never understood why french engineering is supposed to be bad . 
  then they stop being refugees and become economic migrants . 
  really ? 
  do you know what french greens have been saying for years : the only solution is to use less energy . 
  no technological solution will ever work . 
  as / u/10ebbor10 wrote , the political environmentalists are naturalist and thus anti-technology . 
  canada without quebec would be smaller in size than the usa . 
  that 's one good reason to keep them !, 
  i do n't think high speed trains cross roads . 
  not in rugby . 
  the rules are pretty loose . 
  in france too we use `` k\u00e4rcher '' for power washing . 
  bad language ? 
  the article specifically mentions :  that his work `` encourages violence and intolerance of homosexuality '' and `` fosters hatred with views thats seek to provoke others to terrorist acts . '', 
  5 % really ? 
  in france it is at the very least 25 % and more likely 30-33 % . 
  monarchs give up a `` normal '' life voluntarily . 
  they do n't have to . 
  even if rich or well connected people have certainly advantages , anyone can potentially become a great scientist , prime minister or great musicians . 
  they can not become king or queen . 
  and in the very recent past , kings and queens have abused their powers in the netherlands , belgium , the uk , ... 
  it 's well known , well documented , kept under the rug by the establishment as much as possible . 
  he might have been angry , but you seem totally blind to the fact that monarchies are totally anachronistic and obsolete . 
  he gave you real arguments that you simply dismiss and attacked him personally . 
  one sentence saying he hates monarchies and that 's the only thing you argue about . 
  i also hate monarchies because they stand against an important principle : we should all be equal relative to the law . 
  they are born `` better '' than the rest and that is against everything i stand for . 
  are you gon na call me angry and dismiss any argument against monarchies ? 
  he 's giving you arguments and you call him angry !, 
  the dutch royals are a taboo subject in the netherlands . 
  i have lived both in the uk and in the netherlands . 
  in england , i use to talk about their royals and most brits were willing to discuss the subject . 
  in the netherlands , it is not the case . 
  my wife is dutch and i remember in a family gathering , her cousin making a joke about the royal family . 
  he was immediately told to shut up by his father . 
  it 's weird , because you can talk about anything with dutch people , but not that . 
  that 's exactly what i said !, 
  people in france or germany take their republic for granted and are not remotely interested in discussing it . 
  people in the uk , for instance , are ( sometimes ) highly interested . 
  that 's not the way democracy works . 
  most republicans living in republics ( france , germany , etc. . ) do not care . 
  whereas many monarchists living in monarchies care a lot . 
  it 's highly biased . 
  lol , i understood this !, 
  you basically have many dutch , scandinavians and a few brits happily downvoting anyone criticising monarchies . 
  it happens every time . 
  oh my god !, 
  some of them have to work !, 
  and hard too !, 
  it 's like the kardashians in the us . 
  famous people who have never done anything to deserve their fame . 
  relevant : https://youtu.be/k1bhuyob8fm, 
  when i lived in paris , it was my experience every day . 
  title sounds like a porno . 
  article is disapointing . 
  is there a difference between the german and french speaking parts ? 
  i seem to recall that when you had a referendum on being a candidate for eu membership , the german part voted overwhelmingly against and the french part was more split or even slightly for ( this is from memory , i could be wrong ) . 
  ~ ~ also the [ death of pierre b\u00e9r\u00e9govoy ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pierre_b\u00e9r\u00e9govoy#death ) . 
  suicide or not . ~ ~ / u/squiksquik mentioned it before me . 
  that 's impossible . 
  have you ever met a french person neutral on any subject ? 
  it exists in every town/village in france too . 
  they top the `` satisfaction with personal relationships '' . 
  i guess it helps when you live in your parents ' basement !, 
  because not everyone is a criminal , or descendent of one . 
  `` normal '' patents are 20 years ( give or take a couple of years since it depends what you consider the starting date ) . 
  some patents called utility models have a shorter life ( less than 10 years ) . 
  virtually all `` real '' patents expire after 20 years , and this is unrelated to the domain ( with the exception of design , maths , computer algorithm , ... which are or not valid in different countries ) . 
  again , i am trying to be objective here , but you do not understand the issue . 
  pharmas put out a patent when the drug is still being investigated . 
  about 5 to 12 years later , it will be on the market ( a few more research years and up to 10 years of development , i.e. 
  clinical trials ) . 
  so the 20 years are really 10 , or less . 
  during that time , they have to make between 500m and 1b euros to compensate . 
  in europe , it 's all very much influenced by states , since they negotiate the prices with pharmas ( social security , nhs , ... ) . 
  the drug prices in europe are very reasonable ( compared to the usa for instance ) . 
  it 's not a free market situation at all . 
  note that patents can be voided in case of public safety . 
  it 's a political issue . 
  you do n't know what you are talking about !, 
  sorry to be blunt . 
  patents are granted for 20 years and , yes , in some case extended for a few more years . 
  copyrights can last a lot longer and that 's probably what you are thinking about . 
  no patent as ever lasted 70 years . 
  patents in the pharmaceutical industry are critical to the very existence of pharmas and biotechs . 
  at last , france is shining !, 
  math has always been a big thing in france . 
  i was walking with my son recently when we crossed cedric villani , an easily recognisable fields medal winner . 
  my god !, 
  you really believe the people on / r/europe are mostly for the uk to stay in the eu , because of the uk 's contribution to the eu budget ? 
  lol , now we know the truth : / r/europe subscribers are all eu accountants . 
   calais crisis .

  it 's just some french people are embarrassed because they do n't speak it well , if at all , or otherwise it 's just rude for foreigners to directly speak to someone in english in france before asking the seemingly obviously polite thing `` do you speak english ? '' . 
  we 're not the rude ones in those cases  when hispanics immediately speak spanish to me in france before asking `` hablas espa\u00f1ol ? 
  '' , i find it rude too ( but i stay cordial . . but still , it 's obnoxious on their part ) . 
  no , i do n't think it 's wrong in the slightest bit . 
  in the grand scheme of things , war is irrelevant . 
  what does war have to do with a common identity ? 
  and much of the time , war was n't fought out of hatred like the modern wars are . 
  the franco-british enmity was an old rivalry , with mutual respect and a sense of honourable combat . 
  in comparison , the turks were always considered outsiders , which reinforces the sense of europeaness despite conflicts between europeans themselves and occasional alliances with turks . 
  but overall , every old country used to be fighting tribes which eventually united . 
  the ancient greek nation states fought eachother . 
  are you saying that means they do n't have a common background ? 
  the kingdoms of britain fought eachother for centuries before uniting and becoming england . 
  now i could do this for practically every country out there . 
  european civilisation is a thing , like western civilisation . 
  most of european civilisation inherited from greco-roman culture , then shared christianity , followed later by trends and ideas like the renaissance , the enlightenment , the `` age of discoveries '' and whatnot , making most european countries intrinsically linked culturally ( and ethnically , i 'd say , but that 's less of a requirement ) . 
  this is quite known for french people , but not so much abroad . 
  in the french constitution , under extreme circumstances , if the country is deemed in some sort of danger or something , the president of france can take full-powers in order to get shit done , essentially becoming a dictator . 
  it was used only once in the 60s , by president charles de gaulle ( of course :p ) , when there was fear of a coup d'\u00e9tat by the far-right military over keeping french algeria . 
  [ french wikipedia source ] ( http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/article_16_de_la_constitution_de_la_cinqui%c3%a8me_r%c3%a9publique_fran%c3%a7aise ), 
  i 'm assuming bosnia was christian before the turks invaded them ... 
   it 's pretty amazing considering they were at war with most of europe same thing under louis xiv , for some 60 years . 
  good times . 
  we do have compulsory military service in france . 
  it lasts one day around the time we 're 18 , we have to go to some barracks and sit around all day . 
  we get taught about civic duty and the usefulness of the military , we have to pass an `` intelligence '' test so the state can know if we 're legally retarded , and leftists and hoodlums act rudely to the army staff so they can show off at how they 're questioning authority . 
   and gb should be one of them , right ? 
  i 'm ok with britain having nukes . 
  it 's a moderate , stable democracy , and what stops it from using nukes is its own moral stance , more than fear of reprisals or international pressure . 
  the same ca n't be said for every nation on earth , sadly . 
  yes . 
  i feel at home wherever i am in europe . 
  the different regional and national cultures may be different , they do n't feel foreign to me . 
  i find european civilization beautiful , and it has accomplished so much for the advancement of the human species , and i 'm proud to be a part of it . 
  i know people say `` hur dur , how you can be proud when you personally did n't do anything ? '' ... 
  well i know i personally did n't do anything , but i 'm proud to be a part of it . . 
  i 'm proud of british scientists , i 'm proud of italian food , i 'm proud of germany winning the world cup ... 
  i 'm happy that i belong to a large group of countries which have a common background and future . 
  i do know that . 
  everyone wants to be their separate thing nowadays anyway ( uh , except the walloons being in a country with the flemish i guess :p ) . 
  but without wanting to offend , it 's by mere circumstance of history that you 're not french  ^ ^ the ^ ^ brits but people like the statu quo , hence why walloons are okay with living with the flemish who arguably do n't give them much love back . 
  ^ ^ come ^ ^ to ^ ^ le ^ ^ fatherland ... 
   as a frenchman/woman, 
  i 'd greet wallonia with open arms . 
  wallonia is n't doing very well economically , sure , but compared to the size of france ( in population , and economy ) it would n't affect our economy that much . 
  culturally , it would be like all our other regions which have their own identities , so i do n't see that as a problem either , not to mention the walloons fit well with the neighboring areas in france already . 
  dailymotion is slow as fuck for me for some reason . 
  do n't know why . 
  but thus i hate it . 
  shhh , do n't take away france 's and britain 's statuses as the main traitors . 
  who would the poles and czechs have to complain to for another 50 years ? 
  j/k luv ya all, 
  alright , if you 've never seen a far left party advocating for totally open borders , that 's on you . 
  i 've been to university . 
  i did n't make up jack shit and you know it . 
  i also judge people by their morals . 
  i 'm for gay rights . 
  i 'm for equality with women . 
  i 'm against death penalty . 
  i 'm for democracy . 
  if you think those 72 % immigrant kids in antwerp will be brought up by these western values , good on you . 
  i like your optimism , and your naivet\u00e9 is quite cute . 
  what strawman ? 
  i 'm saying europe should accept millions more immigrants . 
  billions even !, 
  i mean , there 's no limit . 
  you disagree ? 
  southern french would be `` bieng-venue anyway , there 's also this website : http://fr.forvo.com/word/bienvenue/#fr which could work for other languages . 
  pretty much the same in france . 
  though in france we have tv adds , but they 're quite strict . 
  on public channels , you get a 5 minute break where each candidate/party gets a minute or so highly regulated spot to promote themselves . 
  kind of weird to watch . 
  it 's like `` here 's a message from the communist party ... now here 's a message from the front national '' . 
  i 'd happily move anywhere in europe provided i get a decent salary for western standards . 
  i 'm not so interested in overseas territories though . 
  maybe he 's a dutchman of turkish background . 
  the system of election for these local councils makes it that the winner is the one who gets the majority vote . 
  in the second round of these elections , the runoff is usually against mainstream parties who pool a lot of the votes of the eliminated parties . 
  so it 's hard for the fn in particular as it would need to be the first party in rather large areas , in front of mainstream parties . 
  not to mention local elections are traditionally not where the fn gets its best scores . 
  in the last election of that kind , the fn only had 1 seat . 
  getting 62 now , and having general scores in the areas they were in between 30 to 40 % , is a major improvement . 
  eh , i guess i see what you mean , but it 's hard to consider france a `` catholic '' country , not to mention hollande is probably an atheist , or at the very least his beliefs are irrelevant . 
  in elementary and middle school , i 'd go to a special french-american school in another suburban town , and even then i 'd just take the normal public transportation buses . 
  no special buses for that specific school . 
  granted . 
  the article , however , mentions creationism as taught as an alternate theory to evolution , and that 's the same kind of problem . 
  from my experience , here it 's mostly muslims and evangelists influenced by americans ( and most notably , from what i 've seen , black evangelists - i 've known a few of those , really fucking weird ) . 
  good times . 
  history . 
  lol, 
  yeah , that 's the main problem really . 
  would really need a common foreign policy , and one that can act fast . 
  not deliberating between all 25 or so eu countries . 
  like for mali , france intervened without even waiting for un approval ( which it got later ) simply because there was no time as the jihadists were about to take a central airport . 
  imagine if it had to wait approval from all eu governments . 
  so a common foreign policy would imply an executive power held by few people , on behalf of all of the eu . 
  hard to imagine this currently . 
  that 's again why my strat for federalization is that it should be progressive , starting with a few countries here and there , until it takes over every eu country , 
  cyprus only has 3 unesco world heritage sites : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/table_of_world_heritage_sites_by_country you 're probably confusing them with national monuments , which obviously are much more numerous for each country .

  the same procedure that happened to fillon . 
  no shit it 's partisan , sherlock , that 's called an opinion . 
  that has nothing to do with `` interesting or not '' . 
  it 's on topic . 
  it 's valuable , and should be upvoted , period . 
  way more than the dick sucking comment . 
  [ this sub is r/the _ donald for europe ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5zr8sj/macrons_official_program_for_europe_in_french/df0isgb/ ) . 
  pathetic . 
  things is , you have as much intel agency as you have landers , making it very inefficient for us . 
  poland really does n't need the eu . 
  maybe because it 's not a country ? 
  france has a counter espionage unit that cover it 's interest and by extension , european ones . 
  and they could have refuse to investigate , thinking there was no case , which they did n't . 
  so it does mean a lot . 
  there is . 
  27 services actualy . 
  he is under investigation after the anticor requested it . 
  you are n't up to page . 
   http://bfmbusiness.bfmtv.com/france/patrimoine-de-macron-anticor-saisit-la-haute-autorite-pour-la-transparence-1121023.html, 
  that moment when someone is on topic and gives an interesting critic , but r/europe is too dumb to properly upvote . 
  lmao , it 's about god damn time . 
  some good , some bad , some 15y + objective , lots of already done . 
  you just spit non sence expecting to make a point . 
   `` half of fn mps '' yeah so like 1 person . 
  nice way to twist things and show them as more than what they are . 
  you are no better than the fake news people are laughing at . 
  i see now why you are exposed to fake news , maybe you still are in the 13yo demographic using facebook . 
  oh i 'm sorry , did the judge already give the sentence regarding fillon 's trial ? 
  yeah , no . 
  innocent until proven otherwise , ever heard about that ? 
  so you see , your problem is just your shitty source of information/environment/education . 
  i follow a shitton our election and i 've never seen them . 
  if you 've been exposed to this by your environment , consider changing it . 
  enough people to make it to the headline . 
  so probably more than the norwegian population itself . 
  you interpreted it as an insult maybe because you are the triggered little one here . 
  doing it for millenia is hardly an argument . 
  weve been raping women for millenium too . 
  your fault for falling on our own bullshit . 
  the first rule of the dealer ( of moral ) is to never consume/believe in your own dope . 
  your parent never told you `` fait ce que je dis , pas ce que je fais ? 
  call out the one who are fucking up by my book , at the moment , norway . 
  yeah , so i guess most of europe is racist then . 
  i would totaly understand people being shocked over this . 
  lots of french are n't even really happy about the other eating horse/rabbit . 
  no , the article 68 of the constitution already gave him legal immunity , unless high treason . 
  chirac just made it more clear . 
  like i said , sustainable level is not what is debated . 
  anybody that disagree with me is biased !, 
  if you do n't care . 
  why are you even here ? 
  asian have been eating dogs for centuries and look at european 's reaction regarding this . 
  basicaly , you are the asian here . 
  extinction is not what is at stake . 
  it 's the morality of the act and the people making it . 
  if botswana was doing it , nobody would say anything . 
  botswana is not our media 24/7 shown as the bright shiny example of the greatness of mankind , unlike nordic countries . 
  so yeah , you wanted to be an example , you get bashed for the smallest miss step . 
  actually , spilling blood is how you buy a country . 
  want part of france ? 
  send an army !, 
  did you guys fall from the last rain ? 
  why do you think chirac runned ? 
  why mitterand did ? 
  thats not embarassing, 
  because i value blood more than money ? 
  not really xenophobic . 
  my neighboor living under my roof for a time is still just the neighboor and will never own the house . 
  and that 's why you are n't french . 
  different country will react diffently to this . 
  i 'd be embarassed if my president had a public image like this . 
  sarkozy had this style and paid for it . 
  very particular election with about no incidence of the direction of the country . 
  but yeah , granted a vote is still a vote , so i 'll correct myself . 
   why are you not worth the same as someone else ? 
  the whole idea that `` i pay tax so i 'm worth as much as anyone '' is just wrong . 
  we had german in france before wwi . 
  they were paying tax too . 
  paying tax does n't make your worth , otherwise rich  poor ? 
  lmao . 
  stay strong buddy . 
  everyone has to go the shame corner from time to time . 
  that 's not better than the elite politician openly ignoring the average joe . 
  i 'm not even mad . 
  we were probably burning some ourselves with the air controler strikes . 
   people have a right to self determination , fullstop nobody is holding back catalan , the land remains spanish , no matter what . 
  my take a catchy sentence made for individual and try to apply it to a whole region . 
  region do n't have self determination right and that is why we are against the crimea farce . 
  because some shit are not for sale . 
  like nationality . 
  no amount of paid tax will give you the right to vote in france for election that matter . 
  you soon will have no pound to hand over . 
  scotland isnt a huge economic area like catalonia is for spain . 
  who would be stupid enough to let go of 1/3 if its gdp . 
  you want me to finger point it out ? 
  get a fucking definition of both terms and see for yourself . 
  if you are too limited to even do that , do n't bother answering me . 
  also , do it in french since you obviously are fluent . 
  you are n't so great at english either . 
  otherwise , you 'd know the difference between facts and your opinion .

  these people have seen the worst in humanity and are fleeing war . 
  what the hell do you think is right to do ? 
  do you think arabs in the middle east care about that ? 
  especially since now we are in a same union that commonly joined france 's war effort ? 
  they see americans and europeans , westerners , that 's it . 
  and how can we blame them to see it that way , we 're all in the same alliance system that links back the the us anyway . 
  oh , and your country may not be responsible for anything happening to the middle east , but i assure you it is surely taking a huge profit from it . 
  unless people there do n't drive cars i guess . 
  today 's situation in the middle east is a product of both world wars . 
  if europeans had nothing to do with it i 'd be surprised . 
  this . 
  what the fuck seriously , i agree that europe ca n't welcome the world 's misery , but when there 's a war that deadly ( for which we are partly responsible let 's remember that ) and we have the capacity to help out we just should do it . 
  if i were a war refugee i 'd be so happy to be received with a warm welcome . 
  well he does present the situation as if it were that easy, 
  give an ak to this man and send him there if he thinks fighting is that easy . 
  asshole, 
  if you think the germans are neoliberals you are very wrong, 
  send charlie sheen , britney spears , mikey cyrus and lindsey lohan to isis and their society will implode in two weeks . 
  the one set by french law ? 
  you 're making huge profits in a country , following the rules of the place sounds fair . 
  let the world think us weak , there is n't a greater advantage than being underestimated and dismissed . 
  france has been able to involve itself in dozens of conflicts without anyone knowing . 
  it 's a great thing to be able to wage war without worldly backlash for using force . 
  as for the first world war , i do n't think any army has fought better than the french . 
  the defense put at verdun was practically an all in and the war staff decided they would hold this position no matter what . 
  i remember my professor in strategic studies saying that neither the british nor americans would have held verdun like the french did . 
  segregation was legal , does n't mean it was right . 
  if we ca n't complain about arseholery in the legal system , what kind of democracy are we living in ? 
  fuck all those who criticize this move , seriously . 
  he has taken the most honorable approach and that is what france is about . 
  we are not going to let people who used the refugee flow to go back to france quietly stop us from showing humanity to those who are fleeing war . 
  so what , out of a million there 's eight or nine that committed an attack ? 
  we are going to let a few assholes condemn war refugees ? 
  fuck that . 
  the terrorists were french and belgian nationals anyway , they could have gone back without the refugee crisis . 
  opening our arms to them is not only what proves we are better , but it also completely delegitimizes islamists ' speech about us . 
  refugees will see that contrary to being their enemies , we are ready to shelter and protect them . 
  we are humans , and as humans we should be open to helping those seeking help . 
  we should n't put a price or judgement on these refugees because of the potential risk they represent . 
  we keep repeating and telling ourselves that we are the good guys and the is is bad , yet we 're not ready to act as the good guys ? 
  i am happy that europe 's leaders are pushing for an agenda of simple human decency . 
  isis was created when al-baghdadi got al qaeda in iraq involved in the syrian civil war . 
  libya had nothing to do with isis , except for leaving a power vacuum that allowed them to create a branch there . 
  the plan in question is probably being drafted right now or will be after hollande meets putin and obama, 
  from what ? 
  i guess i went to war in syria and iraq in my sleep , then, 
  social changes do n't take hundreds of years . 
  rome has been through hundreds of trends and cultural shifts , especially with its expansion and integration of many peoples . 
  it 's hard to point at a so-called `` decadence '' , that existed even before the empire , to explain rome 's downfall . 
  rome falling because of its decadence is from the writing of a very conservative aristocratic patrician order with the likes of cicero or livy . 
  most of our sources from rome are from this class that existed ever since rome became a republic , they are the guys who always thought that rome should go back to its initial state . 
  on the other hand we rarely have the point of view of a plebeian or an equestrian . 
  and now that i think of it , i never recalled later romans to be more lenient in regards to barbarians . 
  to the contrary they still viewed them as inferior and talked about them in a completely alien way ( from the accounts of roman ambassadors about theodoric , if you want a source ) . 
  they never lost any kind of tough-ass attitude , it was just directed at their political enemies and other romans instead of barbarians who were viewed as good mercenary armies for political leverage . 
  they still took up arms for an organization that was the target of french air strikes . 
  at that moment they became enemy soldiers , there should be accountability for that . 
  that 's still dumb as fuck . 
  roman society was already pretty liberal sexually and sometimes hedonistic even before octavian . 
  his political rhetoric was generally about confronting the vice that had taken rome , but at the same time while we had a society like this it was the beginning of rome 's greatest period of stability . 
  yeah i 'm not calling for summary executions in the street , but now that even the army is involved and that we 're in a state of emergency , why not directly imprison all the known militants who went to fight for isis ? 
  an executive decision saying that they 're enemies of the state would be pretty much enough to do that , and no one would complain . 
  we should n't consider them european anymore . 
  at the end of the second world war , the french who joined the ranks of the ss in the charlemagne division were executed . 
  that 's how you deal with those who join an organization that has declared itself an enemy of your country , i do n't see why it 's not that simple . 
  they were trained and funded from syria and iraq . 
  the base of power and revenue isis holds is from their land resources . 
  the battle is there , not in europe . 
  you ca n't just increase security and brace for the next attacks , you have to go to the source , where the gunmen and suicide bombers were trained , where their plan was put in motion . 
  there will always be someone to take an ak and shoot everyone in the streets anywhere . 
  you can stop the war where the people get trained to use the ak , though , and for that you go to the middle east . 
  i 'm just curious what invoking this article entails , we 'll see after today 's meeting of defense ministers . 
  why do people keep comparing today 's eu to the roman empire ? 
  it 's dumb, 
  without the world knowing , we are forming a second grande arm\u00e9e , and this time the uk will have to be part of it . 
  genius . 
  some of the gunmen friday were combatants from syria . 
  it likely means that is does not trust the lone wolf terrorists to act on their own since they 're untrained . 
  they needed to send people to give orders on the field and prepare the campaign . 
  this is the dumbest shit i 've ever read in my life . 
  we 're not letting in self-governing war tribes that we 're using to wage civil wars between ourselves in europe . 
  the french government said they were expecting an attack . 
  they knew something was up . 
  the guys in these attacks were not homegrown/lone wolf terrorists . 
  they were equipped , trained , executed a planned operation , and most likely went through military training . 
  it 's not a question of force . 
  the us is already making pretty clear that they desire closer relations with australia , new zealand , and canada with deals like the tpp . 
  america is turning towards the pacific and needs these two allies to have better weight when dealing with china around the spratleys , that 's why the commonwealth wo n't mean much politically in the future : all of these close cousins are already being flirted by the coolest guy in the family . 
  yeah but the eu is stronk , he knows what it means to be insignificant that 's why he 's warning his english pal , 
  mid-sized economy , yeah . 
  compared to the us , china , and the eu the uk itself is a dwarf, 
  but france and germany unimpeded , this is like charlemagne all over again . 
  this will be glorious , the plan is working, 
  hahaha that 's funny you think the uk has the power to do something like that while ` murica is around, 
  i did n't say people who speak one language are stupid , but that training your youth to communicate in different languages can never hurt, 
  well done sir, 
  well , someone who goes to work for minimum wage in france does n't really need english unless he 's in sale in a touristy area , so kinda . 
  because it 's the most spoken language in the world does n't mean you should n't educate your youth to be smarter , literally nothing stops anyone from becoming fluent in another language . 
  half of the people in said section barely speak any good english anyway, 
  notice the absence of the uk , italy , and france .

  : / it 's relatively safe if poor , and will send a message that we do n't tolerate violence . 
  well , i hate defending the russians , but if a country deserves it , it 's probably the ksa . 
  here is something that i support 100 % . 
  if anything else it 'll force people with underwhelming skills to retrain . 
   next time just post `` i 'm 15 years old and very smart '' , so i do n't waste my time . 
  next time just post `` i 'm above all responsabilities and feel the need to tell the frenchs that they were nazi collaborators '' as a flair while you 're at it . 
  there 's 50 years of difference between the current frenchs and vichy . 
  there 's 0 year of difference between current russians and what 's happening currently in neighboring countries . 
  but okay if you want to say you have no control over your gov , i can get that much . 
  fair enough . 
  i 'd answer `` then enlight us \u00f4 mighty '' , but seeing a bavarian flag instead of a russian one i ca n't help but wonder whether you are another foreigner that never even got close to russia , or another expat that fled it but ca n't help but defend it despite russia invading ukraine & being general asses with everyone as of late . 
   you guys went totally crazy with your hatred . 
  denouncing russian bombings & russians dismissing it as a joke is hatred . 
  russia bombing it 's neighbors is n't . 
  right . 
  a spoon a day keeps the russian missile away ? 
  okay . 
  and if during one of their exercise they `` accidentally '' empty a full grad load on an latvian village like they regularly do in ukraine , what do you think is going to happen ? 
  because , with the current standing orders ( because nato soldiers wo n't take russian missiles in the face without replicating . 
  and it 's actually a good thing . 
  ) ; that russian position will be a smoking crater 10 seconds later , and it 'll escalade from there . 
  i think most russians do n't understand how close they currently are to a war with the eu/nato . 
  it 's worrying they dismiss it that easy . 
  no invading ukraine & sabre rattling in front of the baltics or germany is n't something you can `` not take seriously '' . 
  the word you are looking for is `` russophobia '' ; which for some reason seems proportionnal to the russian military effort to keep pushing in ukraine & other places & joking about leveling berlin , the baltics or other places . 
   why you attack me with that ? 
   though i could also say they have killed half of my family the german 's grandparents killed your grandparents . 
  and it 's horrible . 
  but what it has to do anything with russians painting `` to berlin ! '', 
  on their explosives ? 
   so silly , hope germans do n't take it too seriously and why do you dismiss russian invasions so easily why russia is currently at this very instant showing they are in to do the extreme inverse , killing lots of people & invading ? 
  while they are exactly doing that in ukraine ? 
  i get it , i did the same mistake during peace time ; but now it 's not the case anymore . 
  pointing out wwii stuff and using it again nearly a century down the line is exactly what putin is doing to justify invading ukraine , '' because they are literrally hitler '' . 
  right . 
  you are joking about bombing their capital while invading another country , but no biggie right ? 
  let 's also just ignore for a minute that said germany you want to bomb and invade is the last real occidental country still friendly towards you ... what could possibly go wrong in that . 
  conscription is forcing people to do something . 
  slavery is taking advantage of their condition . 
  here the point is not to make anything of value but to reverse the daesh social programming impressed on them . 
  civil service once they get out . 
  forced conscription to a worker 's service ( public interest stuff like roads or cleaning or construction ) with military-like enforced discipline ( but nobody trust them with a weapon duh . ) . 
  pay them so it 's not slavery , and force them several years in to enforce another lifestyle in . 
   `` we should do what they do in the netherlands , where they move the most hard-core islamists away from the other muslims so they ca n't inspire them , '' khader said . 
  definitely that too, 
  the russia of the 90 show this is a lie ( people literally starved to death while there was plenty of food nobody could afford ) . 
  or even our own homelessness levels in paris . 
  except life in greece do n't costs even nearly the same in albania or cambodja . 
  they do n't have easily 500 $ / mo of rent when going cheap . 
  everything costs about as much as in germany . 
  so when you destroy their income ... 
  but everybody ( esp the germans ) told me the greeks where lazy and deserved extreme poverty !, 
   `` due to growth in [ meat industry ] production volumes , the level of self-sufficiency in the domestic meat market rose from 77 % to 82 % , with a target level of 90 % set by the state food security program . 
  in particular segments , replacing imports is happening even faster than expected , '' said deputy agriculture minister dmitry yuriev . 
  i believe i already read similar claims of ~ ~ [ juche ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/juche ) ~ ~ `` complete russian self sufficiency '' . 
  by the stalinian era party , in my history textbooks . 
  soooo just like during the ussr when there was enough food produced for moscow , st petersburg . 
  just to be clear , this is n't about the eu . 
  no state , whatever it is , can be 100 % self sufficient since ` round 1920 and with modern populations/progress . 
  if the state wants to be viable long term , it needs to trade with other countries ( ffs at least buy chinese food ... ) . 
  he was rewarded the position for being a loyal corrupt agent ? 
  edit : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dmitry_peskov  over the course of ten years , peskov rose through the ranks to become the first secretary of the russian embassy in ankara , turkey . 
   in 2000 he returned to russia to work at the press service of the russian president , serving a number of positions , including a four-year term as first deputy press secretary of the russian president from 2004 to 2008 . 
  he has served as putin 's spokesperson since april 2000 . 
  plenty of opportunities to steal all the moniez, 
  620k only ? 
  they all steal within the hundreds of millions to billion ( s ) range usually . 
  guess he decided to go modest and spend his cash on something else . 
   spokesman do not have much chance to be corrupt . 
  haha, 
  i thought the republicans were retarded , but that official truly takes it to next level . 
  that 's how you get a giant aids and other std epidemic and kill a massive number of russians .

   are your pensions good enough that you can live on it without additional income ? 
  pensioners who had a complete career without big gap of unemployment earn around the median wage [ source in french ] ( http://www.latribune.fr/economie/france/la-pension-moyenne-de-retraite-s-eleve-a-1-306-euros-bruts-mensuels-475756.html ) . 
  so it 's more than enough , especially if you own your house . 
   i 'm very lucky , i work for a state government , and get a state pension , social security and i 'm investing in a tax deferred retirement plan as well . 
  well , everyone in france is in the same situation , pension and social security are mandatory and you can have an additional retirement plan if you want , but it 's rarely used since the basic pension is sufficient . 
  it 's not a perfect system , but you do n't have to be lucky to enjoy life in your old age . 
  yes the state manages everyone 's pension , for the public and private sector . 
  [ basically , there are contributions on salary or on profit for independant workers , which are used to fund retirement . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pensions_in_france ) so a with a french net salary , retirement funds are already taken care of . 
  the major downside though , it 's that it raises the cost of labour . 
  no it 's not the same . 
  in france all pensions are managed by the state . 
  in the us , most pensions are managed by private companies . 
  so it does n't appears in public spending . 
  you have to keep in mind that in france ( and other countries ) pensions are included in governement spending . 
  it 's around 15 % of the gdp , so it explains the difference with countries where pension managed through the private sector such as the usa . 
  well yes . 
  if we fix things we would n't have anything to complain about . 
  but seriously , france is quite a conservative country . 
  it takes decades to change things , even if some problems are obvious . 
  but i do n't agree with you about / r/france . 
  the sub is full of young people eager for change . 
  [ look at this thread about bicycling for instance . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/france/comments/5oi2nc/cest_%c3%a0_strasbourg_que_lon_utilise_le_plus_le_v%c3%a9lo/ ) even though there are still people arguing for the status quo . 
  on the contrary , try saying france is doing something right and everyone will mock you . 
  according to the media france is on the verge of collapse , it 's the poorest country in the world , and life is better everywhere else on the planet ( except for food obviously ) . 
  no , only some members of the right wing of the ps support him . 
  it might change if he has some good results in the election . 
  representatives will suddendly admire him , as they did with fillon when he won the primary . 
  but right now he is an independant candidate . 
  it 's the other way around . 
  the president is powerless . 
  but he appoints the pm and traditionnaly he is the leader of his party . 
  so when the president and the majority in the parliament are from the same party , the president just assumes the powers of the pm . 
  [ however when that 's not the case , the pm is france 's leader . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cohabitation_ ( government \\ ) ), 
  he can choose anybody . 
  but the parliament can overthrow the government . 
  so he needs to appoint someone that have the support of a majority of represtantives , which will probably be fillon . 
  i think he meant that even if macron is elected , he does n't have a party to support him . 
  so he will have to appoint a pm in from another party to rule . 
  as giscard did with chirac . 
  i agree with you . 
  i was n't clear . 
  what i meant is that with hate speech laws you can criticize ideas or one 's specific behaviour but you ca n't incitate hatred toward a person or a group of people for these ideas . 
  i can say that muslims ' views on politics is worrying or how trump 's ideas about climate change are stupid ; but i ca n't say that we should get rid of muslims or trump because of that . 
  they are mocking silly ideas , not the people themselves . 
  saying that jewish/christian/islamic views on women are stupid is not the same as saying that jewish/christian/islamic people should be killed because of these ideas . 
  the snoopers ' charter to begin with . 
  it only works if few countries does it . 
  otherwise it just create a race to the bottom . 
  it has been difficult since 476 . 
   is there another official statement you 're referring to ? 
  do you have a source in english ? 
  the minister of budget [ laid his plan here ] ( http://www.leparisien.fr/economie/le-plan-du-gouvernement-pour-economiser-4-5-milliards-d-euros-10-07-2017-7124781.php ) . 
  but it 's only in french . 
   the current article is based on drafts , not final budget bills . 
  and it has contradicting statements from the ministry . 
  the minister of higher education does n't decide the budget . 
  in france , when the president has a majority in the parliament , he assume de facto the power of government and of the parliament . 
  so since he has decided to cut education and research funds , it will happen sadly . 
  it comes from an official statement by the minister of budget . 
  except if macron suddenly dies , it will be adopted . 
  to reach equilibrium , credits from the state budget are provisioned at the beginning of the year . 
  so the government decided to cancel part of the funds allocated to higher education and research . 
  yeah i remember when i staged a coup to acquire full powers as class delegate but the other kids gave me the cold shoulder . 
  do n't forget that he pays for reddit comments too . 
   expatriate back to france most of their profits do n't worry , profits ends up in fiscal paradises they never go to france . 
   ah right . 
  all of france spent the whole past year talking and arguing non-stop about the election of a guy who has no powers at all !, 
  he does n't have any powers . 
  look at what happens during a `` cohabitation '' . 
   even if you consider that in a semi-presidential system there are two leaders , at least we elect one of them . 
  countries with parliamentary systems do n't elect a single one . 
  i think that it 's still a huge problem that nobody elect the governent in france . 
  it has much more power that the parliament . 
  the president does n't have any powers . 
  he only rules as the chief of the majority in the parliment . 
  and in that capacity he gives order to the pm . 
  but the pm still has a huge influence . 
  look at ayrault/valls , raffarin/villepin , etc. 
  and it 's the same thing for the ministers . 
  they have power but nobody elected them . 
  i 'm just saying that the leader of france , the prime minister , is not elected at all . 
  juncker was elected in 2014 as the candidate of the epp . 
  in contrast with edouard philippe who governs france but was never elected . 
  or that crimes were unreported because there has been less officers . 
  what are you talking about ? 
  macron wants to stimulate competitiveness mainly through labour reform by lowering wages . 
  whereas most economist agree that it can a good idea but , it is only a tiny part of what should be done , namely improving education , tackeling monopolies and fiscal optimisation , focusing on r&d , and improving on nonprice competitiveness . 
  otherwise , france will just have cheaper labour cost , but still way too expensive compared to most countries in the world . 
  there are few working poor ( poor being defined as earning less than 60 % of the median wage ) in france because of the high minimum wage . 
  but the goal of the labour reform is to make people work more and get payed less to improve competitiveness . 
  and to compete with the world , salaries would need to be reduced drastically . 
  so we will replace poor unemployed people with poor working people . 
  and we will make people with low qualifications poor . 
  in that case the perception is different . 
  if you are poor but do n't work , it makes sense . 
  if you work hard but are still poor , people get angry . 
  and they will need a culprit .

i do n't know after ten years you should know the basics of the language without trying if you hear it everyday .

  * most of the monarchies in europe are constitutional monarchies , which means that the monarch does not influence the politics of the state : either the monarch is legally prohibited from doing so , or the monarch does not utilise the political powers vested in the office by convention .

  it is the less ridiculous one , but talking about an independentist push is still a bit far-fetched . 
  * the languages that used to be spoken in france can be separated in two families : the language of oil ( north ) and the language of occ ( south ) , named after how to say `` yes '' in each one . 
  there is a lot of regional variations in each one , and there is no clear-cut border between the two . 
  although some cultural phenomenons can be attached more to one or the other ( cooking with butter vs. with oil :p ) , neither is united anyway . 
  occitania may seam separated from france to the outsider , but it 's mostly because paris is in the other and french derivate from one variant of the oil language . 
  * if you want to tell an alsatian that he is not french , you better start running .

  they sometime manage to gather one or two dozens people to do a pro-independence demonstration . 
  in the last one i saw , they where trying to stay as far as possible from each other to occupy more space . 
  of course each of these region has it 's share of lunatics , but `` regionalists '' are usually more concerned about changing the internal administrative borders . 
  it 's less independentisme than bickering with the neighbors . 
  corsica is quite serious at time , brittany is fathomable , you could add spanish basque independentists spilling to french basque country . 
  but most others are mostly laughed at in france ( including within their own regions ) , and the credit given to it on the internet feels to me a lot like some chronicle freedumb syndrome . 
  to some , they may look like minorities opposed to the french identity , but in fact the french identity is little more than the union of all these regional identities . 
  the main antagonism created by the centralized nature of the country is not peripheral regions against the rest , it 's more everybody against paris . 
  as for the hope for any of them to gain independence , the first article of the constitution says `` france is an indivisible republic '' ( * la france est une r\u00e9publique indivisible * ) .

  in similar conditions , people with similar technologies and cultures will naturally figure out the optimal way to organise their community . 
  you say this ( and i 've heard this argument before ) as though it 's better to be called insane than a terrorist . 
  the fact of the matter is that calling someone `` insane '' completely dismisses his ideology ( far-right in breivik 's case ) , whereas terrorist does not . 
  it 's way worse for breivik that his ideology was n't taken seriously , because his whole point was to get it out there . 
  mainstream medias do n't want to acknowledge far right ideologies ( `` insane '' , `` stupid '' , `` protest vote '' ... ) = people do n't really believe it , so the ideas are n't to be taken into account . 
  way worse than terrorists who 's ideas are at least considered . 
  not to defend macron , but i highly doubt he 'd move along to reinstitute military service if he were elected , despite him expressing his wish to do so . 
  it 's likely one of the first things he 'd drop . 
  not to mention any football fan can go update his favourite football players ' stats and whatnot , whereas i 'm assuming it 's rare to find people who can meaningfully edit cervantes ' wikipedia article . 
  first off , no one 's claiming they 're winners , people are claiming they 're losers . 
  it 's a great logical fallacy though . 
  this situation is comparable to the `` burden of proof '' for the existence of god . 
  it 's to those who believe in god to prove his existence , not to the atheists to disprove his existence . 
  here , you 're basing your argument on what the pvv should have won according to your assessments . 
  so you 're establishing an imaginary reality and basing your conclusions on it . 
  so naturally , you consider the pvv failed because they did n't reach the levels they should in your imaginary reality . 
  but the actual reality of the situation is that they won 5 seats compared to the previous election . 
  surely , you understand the dishonesty in presenting them as failures . 
  it 's much more logical to consider that they gained , rather than lost . 
  but i 'll grant that among pvv fans , there may be disappointment compared to their hopes . 
  and there might be relief for their enemies . 
  but again , regardless , the pvv won 5 seats . 
  and that 's the only reality . 
  lol , that classic `` the far right may have won more seats but they still failed '' argument . 
  yeah it does . 
  villages are municipalities , even if they have 50 inhabitants . 
  a town of 30,000 is also a municipality . 
  so is a city of 150,000 . 
  what op means is n't `` city '' , but rather `` town '' or `` municipality '' , aka the smallest administrative division in the country . 
  but regardless , france does have an outrageous number of municipalities , some 36,000 , which is per capita surely the largest in europe by far . 
  the median population of a municipality is probably something ridiculous like 100 inhabitants . 
  there probably should be a reform of some sort to reduce the number of small municipalities , because that 's just a drain on our taxes ( each has a mayor , the moderately larger ones have councils , which are all salaries we have to pay for ) . 
  but this is france , where `` reform '' is a bad word , and people like their local governance ( which i can understand , however ) , so the process of reducing the number of municipalities is an arduous one . 
  everyone votes on feelings , including yourself . 
  basically the same basic moderate stance all previous governments have had in the last decades , including sarkozy despite a seemingly more hardline discourse . 
  i 'm no specialist on the question but here 's my two cents . 
  robots will always be more competitive , and they 're the future of society and technology , like it or not , so if we tax robots , we 'll only make products more expensive for an already jobless population . 
  now say we tax robots anyway , well there 's bound to be countries which wo n't tax their robots , and thus other countries will have more competitive manufacturers with their untaxed robot workforce . 
  and we 'll be left not only with no jobs , but also no competitive companies paying taxes on their benefits . 
  hell , maybe we should tax robots at first but that 's only for the short term , while we transition to a robot economy . 
  in the long run , that tax will probably have to go , in the same way we do n't tax companies for using computers . 
  he 's not crazy . 
  however he 's very aggressive and headstrong , and if you 're willing to open yourself to different perspectives , m\u00e9lenchon is as much a wild card to people on the right side of the spectrum as le pen is to people on the left side of the spectrum . 
  in reality though , if either were in power , chances are they 'd be more `` reasonable '' than their enemies expect them to be . 
  they 'd both try to do things the opposite side will consider `` outrageous '' , but their own intelligence/conscience and the limits on them by the political system will largely temper their wills . 
  if the ideal goal is 2 % of gdp there 's bound to be fluctuations around that ideal depending on past and projected funding projects . 
  the fn is definitely a far-right , nationalist and populist party . 
  but it 's no fascist party . 
  i believe the unsaid idea was that she refused to debate m\u00e9lenchon because she did n't want to give a platform to someone who was , electorally , way below her league . 
  and to be fair , that 's a very sound political strategy . 
  she had little to gain `` punching down '' , if i dare say so , and m\u00e9lenchon had all to gain with such massive publicity . 
  another reason she gave herself , if i remember correctly , is that m\u00e9lenchon spent his time insulting her , which does n't surprise anyone of course . 
  m\u00e9lenchon is notoriously quite aggressive ( that 's why some people like him ) , especially against the fn considering his far left leanings . 
  this , again , to me , is a defensible reason to not want to meet/debate someone . 
  those are the same reasons chirac refused to debate le pen father before 2002 's second turn . 
  i think she should debate everyone of course , but i also understand the actual reasons she did n't do it , rather than fantasizing about her being scared because she was `` proved wrong '' or something so petty . 
  though i tend to agree with you , that the establishment pointing the finger at her can provoke some electors to like her , i also believe this strategy did create a sort of political `` glass ceiling '' , which is such that the fn could never get a majority nationally in any foreseeable future . 
  i 'm all for the eu , but i understand why a staunch nationalist would n't want it , preferring complete sovereignty , and i 'm not so dense to consider they 're `` lunatics '' for having other priorities than mine . 
  she 's a nationalist , considers french sovereignty and massive immigration and integration to be huge issues . 
  those are classic issues , and her solutions do n't make her a lunatic . 
  you just disagree with those solutions . 
  if your reasons for `` considering voting for her '' were dumb as fuck , does n't mean it 's the same for all her electors . 
  jacques chirac was considered very attractive [ in his youth ] ( http://a407.idata.over-blog.com/2/83/17/43/chouan-4/jacques-chirac-jeune.jpg ) and he still had some leftover charm in him in his early presidency despite his age . 
  i do n't say it to them , i 'm saying it to you guys , because it 's true . 
  if it 's condescending to explain to other people the reality of the situation , then fine , i 'm being condescending . 
  but why should i hide an important detail to a story i 'm explaining ? 
  would make no fucking sense , and at this point you 're just looking for a reason to disapprove of my comment . 
  yes i agree . 
  despite being close neighbours geographically , french and english have such an incompatible pronunciation that i feel it 's very hard to understand strong accents from one way or the other . 
  a strong english accent is incomprehensible in french , whereas a strong spanish or german accent works fine . 
  while i 'm willing to believe some french people get pissed if tourists immediately speak english to them , i 've never witnessed french people being pissed towards tourists trying to speak french . 
  but if people say that was their experience i do n't see any reason to not believe them i guess . 
  but i 'd rather think that people in the service industry in france , or at least in paris , are n't the jolliest bunch , and thus they can be exasperated by all their customers or whatever . 
  having to struggle through a conversation can be frustrating for some people , and the french are n't very patient . 
  so i 'd say they 're not rude because the other person is a foreigner . 
  they 're just rude in the first place :p, 
  yes of course , and then if i notice the tourist struggles in french i switch to english .

  this is exactly how it felt . 
  you are right . 
  i was young and not particularly concerned about history . 
  my point is that 80 years or so after this treaty , it was one of the first things hungarians talked to me about . 
  and they tried to make me feel guilty about it . 
  it 's pretty strange . 
  the first time i met hungarians , they mentioned the treaty of trianon . 
  the first fucking time !, 
  i did not even know what they were talking about . 
  morocco was also a candidate . 
  they allegedly paid bribes to win the 1998 world cup bid , but lost to france . 
  schools in france are poor , not because france does not spend enough money , but because it is horribly managed . 
  it is comparable per pupil ( for primary education ) to what finland spends ( http://data.uis.unesco.org/index.aspx?queryid=189 ) . 
  and , no , i am not from paris , but after two years in public pre-school ( maternelle ) , i put my kids in a private school , not because the private school was richer , but because the public education system is horrible . 
  when a school teacher told me that they will not push my son to do better , because he 's good enough , i knew i had to take him somewhere else . 
  i do n't see why the number of inhabitants is relevant . 
  do you really believe that the finns put more money per pupil than we do ? 
   i remember having days added at the end of the school year to make up for it . 
  lol , in france they would strike to avoid that !, 
  the main reason why a different education system can not be adopted in france is that the teacher 's unions will go on strike endlessly if you try to change anything . 
  hence the increase in the number of private schools , but you need the money for that . 
  it needs to be emphasised : the france 1998 world cup alleged bribes were paid by morocco , not france . 
  because of [ this ] ( http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x23l7e_diane-dufresne-j-ai-douze-ans_music ) ? 
   i know i sound very against him no kidding !, 
  anyway , i do n't think the name change has anything to do with possible financial affairs or corruption . 
  it has a lot to do with ego and coming back anew from a defeat ( at least as a marketing ploy ) . 
  i wrote `` one of the gayest '' . 
  if i were your boyfriend , i am sure i would have seen gayer things . 
  let 's agree that you have the best beers and we have the best wines . 
  is n't that a win-win situation ? 
  sarkozy does not drink alcohol at all , so i doubt he was drunk . 
  one of the gayest things i have ever seen !, 
   the first black brit to vote in a british general election was ignatius sancho , in 1774 . 
  i present you : [ thomas-alexandre dumas ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/thomas-alexandre_dumas ) ( the father and grand-father of alexandre dumas , the father and also the son ) . 
  i quote wikipedia : dumas shared the status of the highest-ranking black officer in the western world only with toussaint louverture ( who in may 1797 became the second black general-in-chief in the french military [ 3 ] ) until 1975 , when the american daniel `` chappie '' james jr became a four star general in the united states air force , the closest american equivalent of g\u00e9n\u00e9ral d'arm\u00e9e , dumas ' highest rank . 
  well , you reap what you sow . 
  i just booked a holiday in crete with the family . 
  it was the last room available ( at this resort , while others were full ) . 
  it would seem that killing tourists in north africa makes people want to stay in europe . 
  who would have thought ? 
  it depends heavily on the route indeed . 
  i frequently do paris-boston and i know always take icelandair . 
  i can get business class seats for the price of economy in air france . 
  air france is horribly expensive , way more than klm . 
  in dutch it 's also called `` hollandaise saus '' . 
  i believe what the ` mericans call french toast is some badly done version of `` pain perdu '' . 
  so not so inaccurate . 
  meanwhile germans do n't make babies . 
  that 's the big difference between france/uk and germany . 
  i heard recently that while germany is losing 100k workers a year ( to retirement , ... ) france gets 300k new people looking for work every year . 
  i might have the numbers slightly wrong , but it was roughly that . 
  i believe it 's roughly similar in the uk . 
  excepted the mediterranean part of france which is very sunny and very windy . 
  in the developed world , investors will not put a euro cent forward if your biotech project has no or can not have any patent . 
  it might be a different story in developing countries . 
  that 's a good point , however the proportion of applications to granted is most probably consistent in europe . 
  i know it is not compared to china for instance . 
  and m ' , n ' , t ', 
  so basically , your concept of the eu army will be able to project itself to another country to defend the local eu citizens . 
   this means that national militaries get downgraded heavily and are focused on defense exclusively . 
  this is an issue in the sense that the nation no longer has the power to project force by itself . 
  so if eu citizens are threatened in a foreign country , you would ask the americans ? 
  for instance , there a hundred of thousands and possibly millions of french people living and working in africa ( ex french colonies mostly ) . 
  what would happen ( as it has in the past ) if some crazy leader in one unstable country decides to kill all foreigners . 
  usually the french army goes in to stabilise the situation . 
  now , with your plan what would happen ? 
  what would happen if argentina seizes the falklands ? 
  what if ( crazy example ) morocco invades the canary islands ? 
  what if an an allied country is threatened ? 
  if you are defence only , all your far away places can be taken and none of your allies can count on you . 
  what this map does not take into account is the type of industry . 
  it 's fundamental when counting patents since some industries apply for a lot more than others . 
  it is not migrant quotas , it 's about refugees . 
  the argument that valls put forward is that you need to count all immigrants for quotas , not just refugees . 
  some countries take in more refugees than france , but france has taken in a lot of economic immigrants . 
  that 's the argument . 
  i have no idea if it 's true or not . 
  no it 's not . 
  since when are french fatter than german or belgian ? 
  there are some good tv shows not available in the us , but available in most european countries too . 
  it goes both ways . 
  good euro only shows : penny dreadful , falling skies . 
  the former being totally awesome . 
   i would say it 's more of a germane point of view . 
  do you mean german ? 
  germane , actually is a word and means `` relevant to a subject under consideration . '', 
  i agree , jumping to conclusions and relying on bad information are not the thing to do right now . 
   i guess that 's the reason why france will ( i read that somewhere , do n't quote me on that ) support the quota . 
  i heard on french radio this morning that the french government will support the quota , indeed . 
  evidently , the main opposition party on the right is against it , mentioning especially what i said , that is that previous immigration will not be taken into account and pointing his finger at scandinavian countries that have had very little immigrants in the past ( i.e. 
  not recently ) . 
  since he 's a politician i am not trusting what he 's saying , but i thought that his point on past immigration was a good one . 
  so you 're only half french then . 
  not a real [ french ] ( http://les-chemins-de-traverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/superdupont.jpg ) !, 
  the big issue with this system is that it does not take into account the refugees and other immigrants that countries have taken in in the last 50 years or so . 
  some countries have taken a lot more than others and only considering today without looking at the past is a big mistake . 
  it 's a long report . 
  i was interested in looking at the differences between france and the uk . 
  both have a similar population , birth rate , life expectancy . 
  so why would it be projected for france to have 75.7 m people in 2060 and 80.1 m for the uk ?

  his smile is little bit weird . 
  that 's funny because on the other end , macedonia , ukraine and georgia are flying it quite a lot apparently . 
  i 'm extremely conflicted because on one hand , the european olympic team would destroy the competition compared to our national teams . 
  but there would be barely anyone left in the winter olympics and many of my favorite athletes would n't even qualify anymore . 
  in the end , i think even a federal europe could keep separate national sport federations . 
  there are precedents on a much smaller scale with honk kong or bermuda . 
  except the accent that is very hard to understand , west africans speak with an adorable vocabulary . 
  they tend to speak a little bit like my grandmother . 
  i think it might be an improvement honestly . 
  well she 's my idol but it really was the exception . 
  i was talking about m\u00e9lenchon and a referendum on the 6th republic . 
  but even regarding le pen 's election , she 's attracting only 25 % of voters in the first round . 
  72 % of french people were against leaving the eurozone ( not even talking about the eu ) last month . 
  a slight majority wants to hold a frexit referendum , but most of france is against it . 
  even if le pen or m\u00e9lenchon win the presidency , frexit will be an uphill battle for them . 
  my source is here , sorry it 's in french : http://www.lefigaro.fr/conjoncture/2017/03/10/20002-20170310artfig00049-trois-francais-sur-quatre-sont-opposes-a-une-sortie-de-l-euro.php, 
  i really do n't think so , the eu flag is so prevalent that i stopped to notice . 
  i 'm actually disturbed when i see the french flag alone . 
  when the setting is official or patriotic , the french flag is always flying with the european one . 
  the only time i see it alone are at frontist rallies and in some rural areas . 
  edit : and in sporting events . 
  i guess the eu flag would be weird there as we often compete against other eu countries . 
  and he 's unlikely to succeed as he would probably need to win a referendum on this . 
  not only did they go to space after poland . 
  but they went after afghanistan , syria and a saudi prince . 
  that just shows how much they hate the metric system . 
  i assumed people who are seeking information about france 's elections ** now ** would n't be french . 
  i seriously hope every french voters have heared about it . 
  i meant john oliver is sufficient for a mildly curious american . 
  ouch !, 
  poland went to space before you britain !, 
  ( i 'm still mindblown by this fact so i 'll continue to repeat it ad nauseam ), 
  it 's a good non-boring introduction to our elections . 
  aww :'(, 
  that would require international campaigns . 
  people would care even less than they do about european elections if most members of a list does n't even speak their language . 
  maybe the solution is a compromise : to do this gradually as macron propose . 
  you would vote for your regional list and for a confederal list as well . 
  but i 'm worried it would add another layer of byzantine complications to eu politics . 
  i hope so and for once we really ca n't blame britain for this one . 
  if macron/schulz/merkel ca n't fix this one in the next ten years . 
  i 'm probably going to lose hope for the eu . 
  yeah demographics is the key . 
  the khmer rouge understood that and that 's why they slaughtered every people who were presumed to be against the revolution because of their social class . 
  that 's a truly left-wing thing to do . 
  and yet he has repeatedly refused to do anything about it . 
  when you stand by doing nothing , you are collaborating . 
  and barely any of them felt involved enough to vote in this referendum . 
  do you really believe they would fight for the country of their ancestry ? 
  it appears to be the new trendy thing to do . 
  i might join the cool kids . 
  the left-wing can and does campaign across all eu countries . 
  if they ca n't mobilize people across the eu but still disagree with the outcome they are either anti-europe or anti-democracy . 
  they ca n't claim they want a democratic eu with blackjack and hookers anymore . 
  then maybe they should vote in european elections . 
  they are the least likely to turn out at those . 
  the eu can change , but an ultimatum from the president is not the way . 
  i think you nailed it . 
  the french way of constantly saying france is the worst is still a weird kind of narcissism . 
  that 's really not specific . 
  that 's broad and populist criticism . 
  i guess i 'm convinced by the evidence that tightening labour laws is slowing economies . 
  i can only hope that the reverse work the opposite way with enough government oversight . 
  demand is very likely to create jobs abroad . 
  except if we enforce protectionnist policies that will drive the prices up , and then the demand goes down . 
  wanting to work toward stability in the middle east without military intervention is probably letting assad slaughter his own people . 
  it may reduce the amount of refugee , i give you that . 
  that seems like an easy cope out . 
  he could share his hopes . 
  he could point out what he specifically dislikes about the current constitution . 
  but no , apparently the people already knows . 
  it might not have the negative meaning associated with `` overtaxation '' . 
  in my opinion , i think both in this conversation are extremely dishonest regarding m\u00e9lenchon 's opinion . 
  you 're right , he did n't object to the high tax rate but to some inconsistencies . 
  however , it was perceived at the time as nitpicking to distinguish himself from hollande who campaigned a lot more to the left that he turned out to be . 
  i 've heard m\u00e9lenchon dismiss several times measures from establishment parties by little whataboutism like this . 
  could n't he support a 75 % tax-rate independently regardless of whether or not he wants to add a financial tax ? 
  is he unable to support the liberation of ukrainian political prisonners regardless of his opinions on sanctions on russia ? 
  i think it 's because of this kind of arguments that he got the reputation that he is unable to compromise . 
  he often has postured himself as someone in support of nothing or everything . 
  but i guess it was his way of distinguishing himself from the socialist party . 
  at the time of fdr , there was basically no social security and trade unions still needed to be rebellious to be heard . 
  there is no problem per se in a new deal policy . 
  i actually believe it would be a good idea and it would be very efficient if we were to loosen the very strict french labour laws . 
  but m\u00e9lenchon is going the other way . 
  he wants to invest in the economy while he expands benefits and limit the ability to fire someone . 
  i feel like he promises everything at the same time and i 'm convinced it will scare the private sector away from france . 
  i can respect this opinion because macron went full retard on this . 
  i 'm not sure i understand how privacy can be so high in your order of priorities though . 
  i would n't be so sure . 
  m\u00e9lenchon will do nothing about border controls and that 's the main issue for le pen voters . 
  at least macron is advocating for fortress europe to appeal to them . 
  probably le pen as she does n't even care to have any economists on her side . 
  m\u00e9lenchon can at least convince some altermondialist economists to support him . 
  m\u00e9lenchon has many flaws in his plan , but le pen has absolutely no plan . 
  she just wants frexit , less taxes , more tariffs and more subsidies . 
  she does n't care if she makes no sense . 
  he wants a lot more reforms for the republic . 
  he wants a new constitution . 
  but he refuses to answer any questions about what a new constitution should look like .

  as for the `` head up my ass '' part , you can apply that to yourself . 
  i live in a diverse neighborhood with many `` muslims '' ( as plenty studies show that islam is losing a lot of influence on the vast majority of the younger generations ) , i do n't only base my worldview on what i read on / r/europe or in whatever far-right party you have in austria . 
  i 'll repeat it again since you do n't seem to understand : nothing in this video indicates those people are isis supporters ( no matter how terrible their attitude is ) aside from your own prejudice against arab-looking people with guns . 
  your generalization of islam is frightening , it must be rough living in a world where you 're terrified of what 2 billion people thinkk . 
   what we need is to go back to the good old days when we could deport 15 million people to somewhere very cold or very hot . 
  you 've just summed up / r/europe since tuesday, 
  looks more like some kind of hunting rifle to me but that 's not the point , yeah of course it 's terrible but if you think that it 's exclusive to belgium ? 
  disenfranchised youths joining criminal networks and thus gaining access to these kind of weapons does n't surprise me , this shit happens everywhere . 
  in france , in the us and i think in the uk at least it 's more common than you seem to think . 
  this video shows no evidence that they support isis . 
  i love how this sub goes on a rampage as soon as you 've got muslims-looking youths with guns shouting , immediately assuming they are isis supporters . 
  ( i 'm not condoning what these idiots are doing ofc ), 
  you 're wrong , every wave of low-skilled migration in the 20th century has been associated with complaints of crime , non-integration and all that , at least in france and the us . 
  in that regard , it 's very interesting to look at the parallel between what was written about italian migrants in the 1920s in france and the right-wing rhethoric about muslims today . 
  irish or chinese migrants faced this exact set of complaints in the us in the late 1800s too . 
  oh and to answer both you and / u/axtolip you 're delusional if you think that immigrants are completely to blame for non-integration , and that european societies are `` the victim '' . 
  you 've ever heard of structural racism ? 
  of social segregation ? 
  you think getting out of poverty and of communautarism is easy when you live in massive isolated housing projects where poverty and thus crime is rampant ? 
  it 's no different from saying black americans living in ghettos have only themselves to blame for their situation : it 's not only wrong , it 's downright offensive and arguably racist . 
  it 's not to say that radical islam works great with liberal societies , of course it does n't . 
  but who let saudi-funded mosquees thrive because they did n't want to fund them or to organize some kind of european islamic religious authority ? 
  european states did . 
  who supported this same country for ages ? 
  the west . 
  who handled the post-imperial era terribly in the middle east and thus led to the rise of nationalism and the rebirth of radical islam ? 
  the west . 
  i 'm not saying we 're entirely to blame for everything , especially us as westerners today that did n't have any weigh in deciding what to do with the middle-eastern mandates between the two world wars . 
  i 'm saying it 's important to stop having such an ethnocentric and `` we 've done nothing wrong '' view because doing this does n't solve any issue . 
  whether you like it or not , many citizens of european countries are muslims . 
  that 's not something you can act on , unless you are literally hitler and would like to commit genocide . 
  oh and you people have got to stop acting like it 's impossible for muslims to integrate , it 's not . 
  plenty of them , despite all the challenges they face in life ( racism , poor socio-economic situation , conflictual education ... ) still manage to get jobs , even go to college and be successful in life . 
  just because you have a few crazies ( whom are for many of them white converts ) , it does n't mean every muslim is evil and that this religion has to be eradicated from europe , because again the only way to do that is genocide , and that 's way , way worse that any terror attack . 
  oh and if you 're answer is going to be any variation of ` bla bla bla white guilt ' or `` you 're probably a foreigner yourself '' please do n't bother typing it . 
  and if it 's to make ridiculous generalizations like `` we dont tell our kids to not date outside of our race/religion cause they are worth less '' do n't bother either . 
  i 'm pretty sure many of the people in this sub would n't like their kid dating a muslim . 
  oh but wait , it 's different because `` muslims amirite '' . 
  because filthy mislums, 
  exactly !, 
  people on this sub get so deep in their racist ( i did n't use this word for / r/europe before , now i just have to seeing how it 's worsening , and things that are said and upvoted would have a nice spot in mein kampf ) circlejerk that they completely ignore the issues facing those populations and they act like it 's a case of `` integrate or gtfo '' , or actually more like simply `` gtfo '' . 
  it 's easy to blame whole communities and ethnic and religious groups ( which ofc makes the problem worse ) and it 's easy too to dismiss any point made that we ( as european societies ) have a responsability in those issues as `` white guilt '' , but it 's plain bullshit . 
  aside from mass deportation ( not doable ) or genocide ( i mean wtf i 've seen this suggested and upvoted at least 3 times in the last couple of days ) , this sub is n't offering any solutions , it 's only intensifying the circlejerk every day that goes by . 
  it is when the confirmation bias is strong enough, 
  nope , all french ( or belgian ) *** citizens *** . 
  being muslim in france = being a refugee . 
  you 're french if you have french papers , whether you like it or not that 's precisely what our republic is all about . 
  acting like those people were n't french because they are n't white catholics named `` jacques '' is both incredibly racist and ignorant , and i 'm having trouble grasping how people seem to agree with this very dangerous rhethoric like they have n't learned their lesson from history . 
  thanks / u/shamalamadindong for pointing out the complete bullshit of what he is arguing even though it gets you downvoted to hell . 
  ironically your not-sarcastic ( guessing from your weird comment history ) comment condones an act way worse than any terrorism : genocide . 
  looking at every thread on this sub today i 'm guessing he meant killing everyone that looks remotely muslim, 
  i wonder about that too, 
  no but wait everyone here in / r/europe is so brave and would definitely fight in any war should it break out !, 
  i 'll have you know they all graduated top of their class in keyboard warriorism and have over 300 confirmed comment karma , which proves courage, 
   maybe if they cut their expenditures and got their house in order they would do a lot better with their budget . 
  state economics is way more complicated than doing your household budget , and it 's a very ideological topic contrary to what many people on this thread seem to believe . 
  some would argue that by slashing spending , you 're not even doing your creditors a favor because it means cutting back on growth , which means you have less taxes going in ( less $ $ = less $ $ for the state ) and you get the deficit problem all over again . 
  so yeah it 's not at all as simple as you suggest . 
  of course greece has been poorly governed in the last few decades , structural reforms are needed , corruption is rampant and greece is one of the very few countries to actually have a `` benefits scroungers '' issue that impacts the economy . 
  however , you ca n't just say `` you 're in debt so quit spending and give back our money '' because it 's of no help , it just makes their economy worse . 
  with greece 's actual economic situation there is very very little chance of european creditors ever being reimbursed , but that 's their blame to take too . 
  states default on their national debt all the time and they have been doing so for centuries , it 's only different in the eu because it 's basically not allowed and no european leader really has the `` political balls '' to be honest about it , so they just delay the payment lower rates and wait until it 's up to the next guy in power to take care of it . 
  in the meanwhile , greece has huge unemployment rates and very little growth . 
   greece does n't have to borrow money from those countries , if they kept their finances in order . . you know every country has a national debt right ? 
  and that greece did n't actually borrow money to the eu , the ecb just bought off most of it when the markets crashed to stop the panic from spreading and the whole of greece 's financial system from collapsing . 
  exactly , people have no idea what they actually want ( dae fortress europe ?!??! ), 
  they just want to be angry . 
  the deal being actually negotiated is way better than anything else that has been proposed up to now . 
  borders have always and will always be permeable ( especially in non-totalitarian regimes ) , it 's not only a matter of political will . 
   we did n't start some stupid shit civil war because `` lol facebook '' . 
  that 's some fine analysis there . 
  i 'm glad people like you exist to enlighten me with their extended knowledge of how the world works . 
  nothing , but it sure is interesting !, 
  you make some interesting points , and i get the `` it 's not our problem '' analogy , even though to my mind it stops strictly applying once people are in the eu . 
  the thing is that border control and camps , at least in the case of calais , are tied by a direct causation link : the fact that france has decided to do british border control for them means people in calais have no chance to actually try and cross the channel ( aside from hiding under lorries and such ) and that is the cause of camps . 
  we ca n't send syrians back to syria , and they wo n't apply for asylum here because they 're scared of being sent back . 
  right now our european legal asylum processing system is schizophreniac and blind . 
  at the same time common responsibility is understood ( otherwise we would n't have the dublin agreements that puts together an european-wide procedure for seeking asylum ) , but theoretically you should send back asylum applicants to their entry point . 
  but what exactly would be the point of sending the calais migrants back to kos and lampedusa aside from worsening the overcrowding there and making relations between states even more tense on this matter ? 
  it 's like putting all the dirt under the rug , only the dirt piles up and takes more and more space under it as time goes by but as long as the rug is there we act like everything is fine . 
  of course the uk does have internal borders , we all do to varying degrees . 
  but those borders are not even the question here , what matters is the common outer borders of the eu . 
  the argument that the uk is an island , that it 's far from being a country bordering a war zone misses the point that the refugee crisis is a common one , not one about national borders , and threatens to demolish the very idea of europe as anything even remotely united . 
  by not even taking asylum * requests * from calais migrants , your government is , in my modest opinon , failing at it 's basic humanitarian duty and perpetuating a situation that could be solved . 
  our government ca n't really do much about the situation : we ca n't send most back ( plus they come back so it 's pointless ) aside from actual economic migrants ( a refugee is someone who was forced out , not someone that is currently not in a safe country ) , we ca n't ignore the problem and wait for them to die , we ca n't let them cross the border because we nicely agreed to do policing for you . 
  so i do n't really know what the british government expects france to do . 
  ps : it 's nice debating on such a sensitive issue with someone who keeps civil , it 's really a change from the usual / r/europe or / r/ukpolitics debate, 
   destroyed by the french state . 
  yeah , that does n't mean it 's a good idea . 
   not sure if you 're trying to put words in my mouth or not . 
  sorry about that i thought you were the same guy from the comment before , who thought the only problem was `` getting rid of the shanty town '' like no actual person was living there . 
   the problem is france 's . 
  the camps are in france . 
  france is not enforcing its laws , or protecting its borders . 
  it 's ridiculous to me that france would try to shift the blame to the uk for this . 
  tell me , how should we `` face this problem directly '' ? 
  because those people want to go to the uk , it 's not that hard to grasp . 
  as macron is saying , the only reason we do n't let them is because of the touquet agreements . 
  it ' not a matter of `` enforcing laws and protecting borders '' , ( edit : sentence sounded angry where there was no reason to ) . 
  if our state did that those refugees would still come back , it only moves the problem .

  edit : well i 'm being down voted so let me clear this up : i 'm not really insulting him , i 'm from polish heritage myself , only pointing out that even deep in the crisis the one thing we french do n't lose sight of is how to enjoy life with the simple things . 
  and when deciding where i would wish to live , that counts for a whole lot . 
  but now i live in china . 
  i do n't know what 's wrong with me . 
  best guess would be your lungs ? 
  oh they totally are . 
  the thing is , the same drone without the ability to have a huge destructive payload ( bomb/missiles ) and a low radar profile to avoid being shot down would cost not even half of that price . 
  also , it would cost a lot less in maintenance per hour flown . 
  if the police were to be given top of the line drone , they would n't be getting mq9 . 
  the media and govs always find a way to make any slight negative into the core argument and make it look like it 's terrible and the end of it all we need to change everything . 
  in the case of norway it 's so obvious it 's really funny , but being french and reddit 's links being mostly from anglo-saxon sources , i can tell you it 's par for the course for economic reporting . 
  according to them , my country will become the worse economy to live in anytime now ... ever since before i was born . 
   wow spain is going back to full fascism faster than i thought . 
  those are reaper drones , they 're meant for the army and certainly have nothing to do with the police overpowering happening in spain . 
  that 's like the us is turning into fascism because they 're buying a new carrier , or the uk because they buy f35 . 
  the country in question may or may not be giving too much power and protection to the state and police lately , but that buy in particular has absolutely nothing to do with it and wo n't influence it . 
  even if the police were to use drones to control people , reapers most probably are n't what they would be using . 
  because that shit is expensive , it 's meant to strike missiles inside enemy territory . 
  a mere `` at home '' surveillance drone costs a lot less . 
   a policy that already led to the demise of the last french-indian arms deal uh , no . 
  the last deal of `` india will built themselves the majority of the french sold rafale after merely a dozen out of the french factories '' turned into `` rafale will buy over 30 rafale straight out of the french factory with no full transfer of technology anymore and nothing being built in india '' . 
  and it was the french side that was blocking the previous deal , because india wanted dassault to insure the planes built by hal factories as if they were coming out from dassault factories ( aka assembly too , even though hal was doing it and not dassault ) . 
  in other words , things were finally getting back before the `` hero of the people '' started to have a fit and renegotiated the deal , which resulted in 1 ) the gdp and any progress achieved going down the drain again , and b ) the new deal being worse . 
  but i 'm sure he will get a really great book and conference deal out of it , so that was worth it !, 
  ( not criticizing the greeks not even for believing and supporting all of that given the times and fake promises made , but that was pretty much 6 more months lost for them ), 
  it had nothing to do with morality , like any arms sale ever . 
  the reason the sale to russia was cancelled was not because russia was being a bully , but because it was being a bully in europe and threatening our european partners . 
  like any country which sells arms ( pretty much everyone ) we 're willing to sell to anyone , but not to the guy who intend to use it directly against us . 
  in this case it did n't , but our allies in the east felt it was going to be used against them so we agreed to cut it anyway despite not being threatened . 
  egypt / saudi arabia poses not threat to us nor to europe ( and before answering about saudi arabia and terrorism , that does not in any way involves the military that would/could get those ships ) , same as the fremm and rafales we sold them that they started using since a couple of weeks ago . 
  you did n't understand what he meant . 
  solar and wind have the issue of not being constant , and we need a way to store the excess when it 's high , and redistribute sais excess when it 's low . 
  one such plan involves norway as a `` battery '' , when power is high , country send it to norway where it 's used to pump water up on hills , and said water will then power hydroplants in norway allowing us to re-use it when solar/wind are low . 
  they did n't pull out of spain , they shut down only the local version of google news there . 
  google the search engine and money maker was n't affected in any way . 
  the french case is about the search engine . 
  they plan to use liquid hydrogen , not a big balloon of gas like you seem to think about . 
  the other two people said no but unhelpfully failed to mention the why : concorde was a supersonic plane ( above mach 1 , the speed of sound ) , which flew at a max speed of mach 2.04 . 
  this patent is for an hypersonic ( above mach 5 ) plane . 
  changed attacked for threatened to make it clearer but i really should n't have needed to ; some people need to stop being so literal and care more about the meaning of what is being said . 
  russia feels threatened , not from a direct attack but from a waning in their own influence to the benefit of the west in europe and china in asia . 
  so they make themselves look like the big bad wolf and attack some weaker countries around them to try and look impressive and motivate themselves . 
  nonsense . 
  it 's like those animals that make themselves look bigger when threatened to impress their opponents through illusions to compensate for the real strength they do n't have ( get on their back feet , make a loud/grave sound , have an eye-looking design of your back-fin , inflate yourself , ... ) . 
  you do n't do it if you 're the apex predator . 
  sharks and lions do n't do any of that illusion shit . 
  they do n't do weird looking stuff to impress you , either they 're coming at you to eat you , or they do n't give a damn about you . 
  and if you come at them they kill you because fuck you you 're a gazelle you dummy . 
  nato is the shark . 
  you do n't call a shark a `` spineless corporate drone '' because it does n't inflate itself to appear bigger when it gets in a tense situation . 
  uh , what are you even arguing with ? 
  i 'm not saying i 'm for or against debt relief not did i say either in this thread , i 'm saying the imf 's position is the same as the ez , which parent claimed otherwise . 
  and you 're arguing against something different , but answering to me , which makes no sense . 
  it 's not whether they 're richer or poorer , it 's that they had to deal with their own crisis the hard way and went through with the hard reforms , to regain the markets confidence , and it was the conditio sina qua none for the eu/ez financial support . 
  and again , that was n't the main point of my message , just a byside . 
  and that 's also why the ez is holding firm , cyprus portugal , ireland , slovakia ... all refuse to pay for a richer nation 's debt . 
  same with the eu overall . 
  everyone happily running in circle . 
  anyway , i was not asking the how or why or saying the ez should not do more efforts to fix this than the imf so your comment is not really following mine , i was saying that no the imf is not metaphorically `` switching side '' , their position has n't changed and is the same as the ez on debt relief . 
   waitasec , so now the new narrative is that the ez thought `` sure , greece needs debt relief '' ? 
  several countries have said greek would benefit largely from one , and a few said they needed one . 
  but none agreed for the debt relief to apply to the debt owed to them . 
  the imf is too saying it 's needed , but can not be done on the debt owed to them . 
   have i been hallucinating the ez denying any talks or inclusion of a reference to debt relief in the agreements ? 
  from the debt owed to them yes . 
  they were never against 3rd parties cutting the debt greece owed them , including the imf , and of course they agree it would be beneficial because duh . 
  never have you heard any ez country say `` oh no no no , no one can cut greece 's debt '' , what you heard was `` we wo n't cut greece 's debt '' . 
  both ( ez and imf ) are fine with it happening , and says it would be a good thing , but refuse to do it on their own part . 
  which is my point ; the imf is not `` more helpful '' to greece by saying that , because they refuse to do a joint cut and leave it at `` somebody ought to do it , as long as it 's not us '' . 
  well , get in line , everyone already has that position . 
   they 're pushing for debt relief , whereas eurozone is blocking it . 
  no , the ez is perfectly fine with the imf forgetting part of the debt greece own them if the ez does n't have to do it . 
  both ez and imf have the exact same position on that matter `` sure greece needs debt relief , but not from me ! '' . 
  at least the ez has some countries in it publicly arguing for a debt relief of the ez part too . 
  you edited your message to add it  if you 're being disingenuous then we might as well end the discussion here , good luck in your echo chamber . 
  why do you focus on my maybe uncalled first line and not on the actual content that follows ? 
  the imf is asking the eu to forget some of greece 's debt , while refusing to do so themselves . 
  how is that a show of the imf being more willing than the eu to help greece ? 
  agreed with the general idea , but mistral is a force projection ship , not support . 
  still makes no sense to buy it , though . 
  actually , poland should n't . 
  just like canada or australia or others you hear on these threads usually . 
  these are force projection ships , they need a top of the line naval fleet to go along . 
  no offense intended to my polish friends but it would make no sense for them to buy that given the rest of their navy , this is one of the last pieces you buy in your modern naval army set ( just before aircraft carriers and the likes ) . 
  that 's why there is no real buyers for it , the only navies that can use it beside russia already have their model for that or conceiving them ( us , uk , france , china , japan , india , ... ) . 
  while they had a great navy the ussr sucked at amphibious ship and naval projection ( they concentrated on subs instead ) , that 's why russia did n't have the know-how to build something like it when the need arised ( their less than efficient deployment in georgia ) . 
  the only possibly not terrible options would be an eventual eu group , italy or even possibly india but none of those want that ship . 
  these are ships with a price in the billions , more than half built and with a single possible buyer , that 's why france was so febrile to cut the deal . 
  we 're not getting rid of it , either we 're going to repurpose them for ourselves to not lose face , or one of our ally is going to buy them to support us but without the need , or we will sell them on the cheap to a country which does n't need them yet but we need to cut our losses and they 're getting a great deal . 
  the imf refuses to cut the debt greece owe them , just as the eu countries . 
  they 're saying `` the other guys should do it , and watch us not do it , and justify that to their own electors '' . 
  that 's not exactly helpful . 
  you know some european people are easily manipulated and biased when they make that kind of analysis when viewing those statements . 
  the imf is saying `` i will not lend unless other creditors agree on debt relief ( aka losing a part of the money they landed ) , but the debt owned to us can not be negotiated in any way '' . 
  it makes sense from the imf point of view , they have to protect their own members ' money , but you have to be seriously deluded to think they 're `` more willing to help greece than other eu countries '' when their proposal to help is to basically say `` eu countries should lose some of the money they 're owned , or someone else , anybody but not us ! '' . 
  they 're saying `` the other guys should do it , and watch us not do it , and justify that to their own electors '' . 
  that 's not exactly helpful .

   you have to beg on the streets dont you dude , you need a little bit of hunger . 
  did you see how many of you are obese ? 
   you wear rags hey do n't get salty cuz we 're more fashionable than whatever crap ivanka makes . 
   we have thousands of brands lol yes . 
  all in size xxxl, 
   about 99.99 % of swords forged in europe at the time were not made out of that type of ingots . 
    heck , the majority of swords made in india or the middle east at the time were n't crucible steel either . 
  of course not . 
  it was n't an easy procedure to produce great quantities . 
  i was contradicting this quote from / u/dyki _ tantsi :  european swords were superior in quality at this time because they had access to better quality materials and europeans already made swords for several thousand years in reality , european steel up to the 1750s was run of the mill and had nothing special compared to other parts of the world . 
  https://www.reddit.com/r/askhistorians/comments/2lx0za/was_medieval_europe_able_to_produce_exceptional/ but in many places in india , central asia , they produced crucible steel which was quite exceptional . 
   like seriously , can anyone actually source any of that bullshit ? 
  that damascus steel was made in syria before the crusaders came ? 
  https://books.google.fr/books?id=x7e8rhl1lf4c&amp;pg=pa80&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false also this article with these sources : http://materials.iisc.ernet.in/~wootz/heritage/wootz.htm  there are numerous early literary references to steel from india from mediterranean sources including one from the time of alexander ( 3rd c. bc ) who was said to have been presented with 100 talents of indian steel , mentioned by pant [ 1 ] . 
  bronson [ 2 ] has summarised several accounts of the reputation of indian iron and steel in greek and roman sources which suggest the export of high quality iron and steel from ancient india . 
  srinivasan [ 3 ] , biswas [ 4 ] and srinivasan and griffiths [ 5 ] have pointed out that the archaeological evidence from the region of tamil nadu suggests that the indian crucible steel process is likely to have started before the christian era from that region . 
  zaky [ 6 ] pointed out that it was the arabs who took ingots of wootz steel to damascus following which a thriving industry developed there for making weapons and armour of this steel , the renown of which has given the steel its name . 
  in the 12th century the arab edrisi mentioned that the hindus excelled in the manufacture of iron and that it was impossible to find anything to surpass the edge from indian steel , and he also mentioned that the indians had workshops where the most famous sabres in the world were forged , while other arab records mention the excellence of hinduwani or indian steel as discussed by egerton [ 7 ] . 
  & nbsp ;  strange and quite contradictory , is n't it ? 
  * 1 ) bullshitting . 
  * 2 ) the source does n't actually exist . 
  unless you can provide to me a photo with the letter . 
  i 'll ask some arabic friends to help in translating . 
   the crucible steel imported by the vikings has nothing to do with the development of metallurgy in europe and further swordmaking yeah . 
  the highest quality ulfberhts were made from very high quality steel . 
  and we know that they traded with central asia through the volga . 
  and once that trade route was closed , the high quality ulfs stopped getting made . 
  clearly we have no ideas . 
   both are inferior to scandinavian tech . 
  the scandinavians did n't have any crucibles so they could n't make crucible steel . 
  the metal they had was inferior . 
   just the usual website blabber . 
  https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21328502-600-lost-treasures-miraculous-damascus-steel/  european crusaders returned home with tales of islamic warriors wielding blades that could slice through a floating handkerchief , bend 90 degrees and flex back with no damage . 
  they called the metal damascus steel . 
  despite centuries of advances in material science , exactly how the islamic swordsmiths created it is still unknown . 
  we can play this game all day long . 
   utterly ridiculous statement deserving of mockery . 
  that was part of the myths created around the metal . 
  you understand the differences ? 
  at least we have multiple brands . 
  you just have one and your supreme leader cheeto in chief told you to buy that . 
   no evidence of it being appreciated in europe at the time . 
  http://www.claysmithguns.com/knives_history.htm  damascus steel was the name that the crusaders gave to the steel that they had witnessed slicing through their own , lesser quality swords , cutting the sword in half in a single swipe without ever losing its edge . 
  the next swipe would do the same to the body of that less fortunate crusader . 
  http://www.nytimes.com/1981/09/29/science/the-mystery-of-damascus-steel-appears-solved.html  the remarkable characteristics of damascus steel became known to europe when the crusaders reached the middle east , beginning in the 11th century . 
   no evidence that the ingots were from india or even central asia , it is mere wishful speculation . 
  so we have no evidence that vikings or frankish had crucible steel . 
  and we know that they did trade with central asia . 
  we also know that damascus steel was very appreciated ( missnomer here , that steel also came from india ) . 
  so i guess that indeed , it 's a huge unsolvable mystery . 
   also , there is still no evidence of that viking crucible steel was imported from india in the first place , there is ** no ** proof that vikings had crucibles while there is sufficient evidence that they had trade with central asia , through the [ volga route ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/volga_trade_route ) . 
  and some of the ulfbert swords show very high quality steel produced in central asia . 
   you cant afford either oh , they president the new ivanka collection during spicey 's press conference ? 
  how nice is it ? 
  what will you buy ?

   shit . 
  that 's war ... 
  seriously . 
  not really . 
  with no troops fighting daech on the ground it 's just high security measures . 
  still less security than monaco or switzerland . 
  definitely a bargain . 
  but if the status quo can not be ended , it will be necessary . 
  one of them had an international arrest warrant to his name . 
  the others were known to our intelligence service and would have raised red flags when they came back on france 's mainland , certainly could n't have walked in with suicide belts and ak 47s . 
  good to see some people realise the euro is hurtful to their economies . 
  they wo n't leave unless there is another crisis , but at least they ask the right question . 
  we say swiss precision because of their watchmakers . 
  at least one of the terrorists , samy amimour , had an international arrest warrant against him . 
  with border checks he could not have entered france so easily . 
  yes . 
  all identified french terrorist were known by our intelligence service . 
  the syrian scumbag was here illegally . 
  true it 's not the same thing . 
  but every terrorist who committed attacks on french soil was known to our intelligence services . 
  there 's about 4000 people with a `` fiche s '' . 
  i suspect when one of them show up at the border , the customs will dismantle their bloody car . 
  currently masters in management and human resources over here . 
  [ found the article in question . 
  ] ( http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/twec.12158/full ) you are right , there is an effect :  [ ... ] we showed that labour mobility enhances trade , all else equal . 
  over the whole of europe , this boost in immigration results in hundreds of millions of dollars of increased trade every year . 
  in other words , negligible . 
  probably why i 've it 's not discussed in economics lectures . 
  they do n't even mention time gain for transporting goods , only labour mobility , which would n't be affected since citizens of eu member states could still come work in france for as long as they like . 
  they 'd just lose a few minutes at the border . 
  on the other hand the authors warn about several drawbacks :  immigration might also trigger resentment in migration donor states through ` brain drain ' of educated and talented workers away from feeble domestic markets . 
  the loss of a state 's most productive citizens can adversely affect economic activity in that country , resulting in losses to innovation and international competitiveness . 
  the size and extent of this phenomenon is a topic of considerable research , and questions linger about the magnitude of its actual impact within europe . 
  but to the degree that it does occur , there is reason to suspect that free flows of labour promoted by schengen may fuel backlash among poorer european nations that lag behind in human-capital-intensive jobs . 
  so schengen might be a good thing as a whole for the eu , but a bad thing for its most vulnerable members . 
  even the authors who seem pro-eu question if the economic gain is worth raising widespread opposition to the eu ... 
  either way this is kind of irrelevant . 
  this is a national security issue , providing the economic impact would be negligible , i believe france should follow the will of its people who are in favour of suspending the schengen agreement by a large majority ( about 2 in 3 according to [ this ] ( http://www.lefigaro.fr/actualite-france/2015/07/09/01016-20150709artfig00288-migrants-les-europeens-veulent-la-fin-de-schengen.php ) poll from last july ) . 
  i assume the numbers are even higher now . 
   all i 'm saying is that it should be obvious for everyone with an economics 101 understanding that border controls make it harder to do business i 've got a degree in economics and business administration and i 've never heard of schengen being a major factor , or a factor at all , for growth . 
  heard a lot about free trade zones and the end of tariffs , never about schengen . 
  do you have anything to backup that claim ? 
  i know what just in time is , i 'm not aware that it 's impossible in the uk though . 
  we 're talking 20-30 minutes delay here ... 
  one of the attackers was stopped by the german police with ak 47 in his car by luck . 
  had there been border controls , the terrorists could not have travelled from belgium to france with their weapons like they did in this case . 
  because she 's far right does n't mean everything she says is wrong and should be rejected . 
  i hope she never gets in power because i know the history of her party , they tried to kill the general de gaulle . 
  they are just saying what people want to get the keys of the country and start a dictatorship like regime . 
  however , she 's got a point when she says schengen and the euro are not only against french interests , they are harmful . 
  you are making an absolute caricature of my opinions . 
  i 've never said there should n't be cooperation . 
  i 'm all in favour of cooperation , economical , cultural , military , but on a state by state basis . 
  where governement can still defend the interest of their people . 
  what the eu want is n't cooperation , it 's integration , they want nations to give up sovereignty permanently , and transfer said sovereignty to supra-national institutions . 
  it 's been said since the beginning of the eu . 
  but the eu project is about making europe the united states of europe . 
  and i 'm not having it . 
  the very ulrich beck you cited as an example is an advocate of the end of nations and pro-federal europe . 
  i say we do n't need a federal europe . 
  we do need cooperation and it exists without the need for eu institutions , take airbus , ariane , the cern , erasmus and so on , they do not require a loss of sovereignty and federalism . 
  as soon as you say `` sovereignty '' , people think you want to turn your country into north korea . 
  of course i 'm not that stupid . 
  i 'm saying globalisation needs to be controlled , and i believe the best entity to do are the ones where a homogeneous political community exist , currently know as nations . 
   restricted borders are still an added difficulty for companies . 
  i 'm not aware that schengen is a big deal for our economy in one way or the other . 
  however , there is a consensus that the euro is hurtful for the french industry . 
  even picketty who is pro-eu says if we keep an independent central bank and the stupid german austerity rule of 3 % deficit , france should leave the eurozone . 
  now we 're talking about a significant difficulties for our economy , greater than losing 20 minutes every time you cross the border . 
  i 'm in disbelief : junker screws us as luxembourg pm , and not only has he got the nerves to stay in office , he thinks he 's got the legitimacy to give lessons to elected heads of states ? 
  i do n't know how long the eu can keep that stance without provoking a shitstorm in the next elections . 
  it is , there 's also a chinese community but these days `` le marais '' is most famous for its gay community . 
  this is the gay-friendly neighbourhood . 
  there could be , some of the terrorists are still on the run . 
   ulrich beck , which discusses the theme quite objectively there is no such thing as objectivity , especially when the discussing politics . 
  more germans are against nation states because they 've seen first hand how dangerous they can be . 
  that does n't mean a supranational parliament and governement would be a good thing . 
  i think the anti-nation movement is actually dangerous , the end of nations would create a vacuum , and the thing that would fill that void would very likely be worse than nations . 
  we can see a very good example with the collapse of the iraqi state and daech . 
  people need something to believe in , and nations are one of those things . 
  the others being religion , ideology such as communism . 
  if i have to pick one it is definitely nations . 
  i 'm not saying people should n't post . 
  i 'm saying we 're going to do what we think is best , regardless of what pro-schengen , pro globalization or anti-nation people will say . 
  that 's your opinion and it 's all very good . 
  you are pro-eu , i 'm a sovereignist . 
  i do n't think there is a point in continuing the discussion as we 're probably not going to agree . 
  i think the eu is weak because too divided . 
  this is war , we need a strong structure to rely on . 
  i think france is the right entity , not the eu . 
   thinking like you 're a nation state island unconnected to everybody else when did i ever say that ? 
  we need to keep the connections with the rest of the world . 
  that does n't mean not having a say in who we let in on our territory . 
  have you been to the uk ? 
  every time you cross their border , you show your id , and you go through . 
  takes just a few minutes . 
  not even every time , i already crossed the tunnel and have n't been controlled . 
  we would have check points again , that 's all . 
  the difference is mainly for citizens of countries outside the eu , they get one visa for schengen , and they have to get another one for the uk . 
  they still get loads of tourists since they are a great place to visit , so are we .

  extrajudicial killing ? 
  are you absolutely sure ? 
   why it has an assembly plant for a319 's , 320 's , and 321 's in the us . 
  that was a condition to break in the us market . 
  the same reason why they built assembly plants in china . 
  unlike europe where we do n't really impose that type of thing for boeing . 
   somewhat less of a honeypot for politicians , airbus ? 
  did you miss the whole scandal with boeing and the us ? 
  or how the us gave the contract for new tanker planes only to backtrack ridiculously . 
  or how poland decided to cancel an extremely favourable contract for jets ? 
  or when eads tried to merge bae and they were blocked ? 
  no politics ? 
   we need to think more like airbus airbus also has long supply chains . 
  with parts being built in france , germany , spain and uk . 
   it was dedication to persist and to work together . 
  yes . 
  it was n't germany giving money to france and telling them : guys go build a plane . 
  thx see you in 10 years . 
   well , i do expect occitanie to give money to \u00cele-de-france while being told hey do n't worry we 'll take good care of it why do n't we just give money to the us and let them build everything . 
  seems like the optimal solution . 
   france as a whole will make greater things than auvergne-rh\u00f4ne-alpes , nord-pas-de-calais-picardie , normandie you fail to understand that keeping everybody involved makes everybody be part of it . 
  when a project fucks up like several did fuck up , everybody is in the loop . 
  if a country just gives the money and is not in the loop what incentive does it have to keep investing when fuckups occur other than ... we 'll put your flag on the rocket guys !, 
   with thinking like this the entire continent will become a flyover region hahahahhahaha ... hahahahhahaha . 
  good one . 
  ` member after the war when all our major scientists went to the us and only 2 major superpowers existed and europe was in ruins ? 
  if we managed to survive that and build top notch technology , i 'm preeeeeetty sure we 'll survive a somewhat long supply chain , 
   but they could do much better if they were actually in for the projects and not to support their own little national space industries . 
  that 's a ridiculous claim . 
  we 're 20 some nations that have to pool resources . 
  it 's ridiculous to claim that it 's not important who gets what . 
  the reason a lot of launcher parts/engines are french made is because well ... we make our own icbms . 
  we will forever want to keep those resources even though it costs a great deal of money . 
   competitors make strides while we discuss for years if assembly line x should go to european country a or neighbouring european country b. 
  it 's a bit disheartening . 
  it is part of the process . 
  i do not expect spain to give money while being told hey do n't worry , we 'll take good care of it and we 'll put your flag on the rocket . 
  win-win . 
  it is part of the reality that is the european project , and we can lament and complain but it 's the reality and that 's the context needed to work . 
  we can complain that russia and the us had to build space projects in parallel , we can complain that the space shuttle was basically a failure because of shifting political goals etc etc etc but things have to move on and the engineers have to consider the political context . 
  so spacex will come and produce this wonderfully amazing exceptional rocket that will put everybody out of business ... 
  okay ... it 's not like onlye europe will suffer ... so will american companies . 
  and either way that 's life . 
  we 'll find other projects to work on and move on . 
  unlike the us , we ca n't really afford creating a huge flyover part for our continent with only 2 regions that will matter . 
  europe competes with politically driven top-down `` cooperation '' to generate a remarkably out-of-date design at the same time as stringent government regulation inhibits innovation in the private sector and has led to mass unemployment . 
  yeah airbus is such an obsolete design ... 
   airbus has a horrible track record of managing mega projects like this ( hello , a400m ) what 's with all the circlejerkers on this thread ? 
  we can also point to boeing 's utter failure with dreamliner 's batteries and shout how boeing will be a disaster . 
  all companies have their ups and downs and pointing to one project to talk about another is retarded . 
  what would dory do ? 
  what if jupp\u00e9 wins the nomination though :(, 
  the belgians would reply to your banter but i guess they 're too busy [ exchanging with us instead ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/59boyx/who_do_europeans_joke_about_most_xpost_from/ ), 
   funny how when confronted with arguments you stop pretending to be i just realised i got sidetracked by / u/nico2845 's arguments that are ** totally irrelevant to the main ** discussion . 
  the french are still very much in love with politics and still very much invested in politics . 
  we go voting more at the elections ** we think are the most important ** more than the elections brits , germans , americans think are the most important to them . 
  if you wan na have a 3 yo discussion about what superhero has the best superpower and can beat all the other superhero 's , be my guest . 
  if you wan na think you won that discussion , also be my guest . 
  but at least the revolutionary wars did n't result in the monarchy being reinstated . 
  we managed to beat several massive powers . 
  another one . . 
  here let me help you out . 
  # it does n't fucking matter . 
  it does n't matter who has more power compared to whom . 
  people go voting for the election they think is the most important . 
  that 's why brits went to vote for the brexit ref more than general elections even though the ref was non binding . 
  and the americans went to the vote for congress in mid term elections with a turnout of 36 % compared to the presidential of 54 % ( and we can have the same mind numbingly retarded debate on who has the most power ) . 
  and in france people ** think ** the presidential is more important than the parliament so that 's why ** they 'll go vote ** more to the presidential . 
  now can we drop this stupid dick measuring contst that is n't even the point of the thread ? 
   cohabitation , where the government is from the party of parliament , not of the president , and where the president has very few powers . 
  and he can dissolve the na and call for new elections . 
  what can the parlament do if they do n't like the president ? 
   those frenchmen had every right to be angry at the french government for forcing them to partake in the war . 
  they fought for the glory of france . 
  the contract was respected . 
  before engaging the war , italy offered savoie , the french also asked for nice . 
  the agreement was signed . 
  the war was fought and won . 
  the regions were given . 
   if one thinks people and their homes are tradeable like cattle are you new to the history of europe or something ? 
  savoie changed hands ( at least ) 3 times in a 100 years before 1861 . 
  italy asked for help and offered regions . 
  ( also nice had a referendum . ), 
   of course , he was . 
  nice was his hometown still weird . 
  the demands of the french were known beforehand at the [ plombi\u00e8res agreements ] ( https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/accordi_di_plombi%c3%a8res ) . 
  plus we have a nice square with his name in nice . 
   the british played a role in negotiations too . 
  and how many died during those negociations :p, 
  well i mean let 's look at history here . 
   the first ( where a union of italian states fought austria ) ended with status quo , is a war that [ you lost ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/first_italian_war_of_independence ) even though you had an advantage in numbers . 
  so now you had to seek allies . 
  france stepped to the plate and now you had 170k frenchmen , 2k cavalry , 312 cannons compared to the 70k sardinians , 4k cavarly and 90 cannons . 
  the austrians had 220k men , 22k cavalry and some 800 cannons . 
  and that ended with a victory . 
  seems like nice and savoie are a fair price . 
  garibaldi was pissed but the frenchmen that died for a war that was n't exactly theirs ... how about them ? 
   it basically was the kingdom of sardinia against austria [ 170k french and 70k sardinians ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/second_italian_war_of_independence ) = kingdom of sardinia ? 
  that maths does n't work out man . 
   the french invasion of spain and then another invasion to restore absolutis guess we were successful where you [ failed ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/french_revolutionary_wars ) .

  truly you should stop smoking whatever dried plant you talk of , i dont believe it does any good to your brain . 
  should you jump in a river when cornered by a fire ? 
  i dont think most french dislike usa . 
  sure the far right dislike them but they also dislike france anyway . 
  for the rest , well , i think it is more like they are unimpressed to the point that [ if they were invited to the white house they would pay no attention to the ceremonial and take a selfie like a tourist ] ( http://scd.france24.com/en/files/element_multimedia/image/selfie1.jpg ), 
  cold war 2 here we go !, 
  right , putin is fomenting war in europe , but we got to worry about one usa agent that went to moscow . 
  there was recently a bill that forced school to provide extrascholar activities and municipalities are free to provide basque lesson in them , just dont except the national level to provide fund for municipalities . 
  actually , many cities are protesting the bill because they have to pay for the activities ... go figure . 
  how one need to debunk such a retarded claim to begin with ? 
   pre-filled referendum ballot well , that way there is no error possible . 
  i dont think that seize has any matter on that question . 
  but on the other hand far right and communist parties are very vocal against europe and very active . 
  considering how they are also supporting on russia , i am starting to wonder , if that could be a russian operation to undermine the creaction of an europe that could threaten their imperialistic ambitions . 
  this belong in / r/conspiratard, 
  so , you are unimpressed , how about we see you on the field ... what oh , you can not because you are in the middle of europe ? 
  you know , we have a brand new helicopter carrier in dock , how about you take it and show us how you play ? 
  i 'll be glad that the other european countries would be pulling their weight and stop relying on france and uk . 
  actually , they often go to the un mission separating northern and southern cyprus . 
  well they had the choice as they had nuclear wepons . 
  but it is clear no one at that time could predict that russia would pull a sudetes in the future . 
  well , ukraine did have a military presence in its territory , but that didnt bother crimea . 
  they did a colossal error when they agreed to renounce to their nuclear weapons in exange of the budapest memorendum russia violated , and need nucelar detterance against russia . 
  they did also hint they would be ready to buy at market place , but as russia is still considering that yanoukovitch is the president , and that the new power hasent any legitimity , they first need to reetablish a new presidency to conduct the negociations . 
  it is a logical move . 
  i once saw a garbage treater fund a protest against a rival project to better carry its own . 
  the article about th\u00e9 guardian being raided by russian commentators with new accounts suggest the later . 
  thank / u/voldemarz from / r/ukrainianconflict i just reposted the tranlation . 
  if that is , this is not a good news at all . 
  if you consider that ukraine is in europe , you are more than close . 
  it is pretty obvious that propaganda and influence paly a good role , and considering how rt went , their watcher are simply not in the same world anymore , it is hence not suprising that more russian speaker are believing putin . 
  not likely if russia keep escalating the situation in ukraine . 
  well , i do think that a lot of europeans opinion on these subject shifted in the late weeks anyway . 
  you know that a good part of russian speaker are actually pro ukrainian ? 
  the pro russian are only defined by their support for a russian invasion . 
  some of us used to believe in santa claus ... apparently merkel still believe in putin . 
  how can you tell if it is not the usual anti western brigade or the snowtard one ? 
  probably some fallout from the period when half of them were russian i guess . 
  then dont bitch when baltic states are more relying on nato than on eu . 
  similary we had an operation in car and the only one that helped us were poland . 
  it is becoming more and more clear that europe is uk france and poland , the other dont really count . 
  there is hardly one country in europe less complice with russia than germany . 
  well if the eu had some balls they would not have to call usa when russia threaten them . 
  sadly you only see uk poland and france . 
  tell me how many germany or greek planes were sent to the baltic states ? 
  you have watched too much rt clearly, 
   the majority of the new far-right french mayors have decided to increase their own salaries , as well as those of their deputies . 
  i love the hypocrisy of these so called populists which denounce the politics in place but are the first to serve themselves . 
  well , unemployement is also a form of social exclusion and is a terrible waste of talents and motivation , morover , it hold people in fear of losing their job and creat a lack of opportunities . 
  i am actually for a finely tuned minimum wage that would be optimised to reduce unemployement , and not for the fight at all cost till the system break . 
  considering that in paris you can get a job pretty easily but not living with a minimum wage , and how other part of the country are pretty cheap but withouth job , i would advocate a more locally defined minimum wage . 
  a simple rule , where there is unemployement , the minimum wage decrease , and when rent are expensive , it increase . 
  well , if the minimum wage is not tuned to accomodate the unemployement , you will soon be in the unregulated world you are painting , but refusing to see the situation is just denial . 
  well , syndicalists were too much holding to unsustainable advantages that when the social structure of our country is going to break , it is going to break hard indeed . 
  think of the taxi drivers , they protested against new licences and stayed undernumbered for the demand . 
  they protested and holded to their advantage to the point that their system was shortcuted by private cars . 
  they are now suffering big losses as they counted their licences prices as capital , but pulled too much from them that it broke . 
  in the same way , our high unemployement is fuelled by the fact that our syndicalists are holding the minumum wage even if they are a lot of unemplyed . 
  if they can not see the harm they do in our country and tune the minimum wage to reduce unemployement , the system will break with undeclared worker , exange of work ( woofing ) and internships . 
  in fact , it has already started to break . 
  they can either start to tune down to recover with a more adapted minimum wage , or fight till the system break . 
  they choose the second . 
  it is clear that we are still in a post ww2 mentality , and a lot of old people and syndicalists are playing against their side , refusing anything because they see themselves as fighters against changes . 
  some managers are still very hierarchical and conservative too . 
  it kind of remember the world wars , when most of the usa citizens were isolationist and did not want to take direct action . 
  portugal wtf ? 
  he was actually in yanoukovitch party , but didnt support ukraine split . 
  this act come just after a pro ukranian rally was organised in his town, 
   as he closed in on the tail of the german fighter , karubin realised that his hurricane had run out of ammunition . 
  rather than turning back to base , he closed the distance and climbed right above the german fighter . 
  the german pilot was so shocked to see the underside of the hurricane within arm 's reach of his cockpit that he instinctively reduced his altitude to avoid a collision and crashed into the ground comfirmed as badass, 
  maybe because it is quite a strategic location , from google map , there seem to be lakes west and east , and it is in the middle of the kharkiv-donesk road . 
  [ russia returning to the negociations ? 
  ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/apr/25/russia-offers-proposal-resolve-ukraine-crisis ), 
  i meant socialists policies like giving benefits , wellfare and subsidies , and high minimum wage ; not communist ones . 
  on the other hand , their socialist policies , while giving money to poor and unemployed , have brought a lot of unemployement , and this is the failure of socialists policies . 
  far right come when there is unemployement , not when there is poor worker like in germany . 
  well , for my country , we can actually asses that the main far right party had increased links with russia in the recent year .

  given how they are anti-european , and how an unified europe would be a nightmare for russia , i would not rule out russian support for destabilisation of europe . 
  ( even if there are basis factors like immigration criminality and other , it is pretty granted that russia is supporting these movement , and that this party is closely following russian interests . ), 
  [ harry 's place remark that russian rhetoric has shifted from painting maidan as nazi to painting them as jews ] ( http://hurryupharry.org/2014/04/24/in-ukraine-the-return-of-the-black-hundreds/ ), 
  there is a post in ukranian conflict [ about russian occupying kindergarden to pressure parents ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/ukrainianconflict/comments/23ut54/unconfirmed_selfproclaimed_slovyansk_mayor/ ), 
  actually , they did use violence agianst politicians that were opposed to them . 
  i would have said fascists , but that was already taken by putin . 
  your flag is in contradiction with your sentence . 
  i like how you lefted out the line with * can protect a neighbouring nation *, 
  while i would support it , there is a strong anti israel feeling in the muslim population in europe . 
  also , some leftists are seduced by these rhetoric , and far right is just basically antisemitic . 
  so i think israel sohuld n't be in europe , but we should have good relation with them as they were never hostile against us . 
  it is also basically the same in france , and you also do get a lot of downvotes for stating it . 
  sometime , it is hard to tell the difference . 
  in france , at least both extremists parties have blatant similarities and often takes each others narrative , such as pro inflation policies and accusations of collusion between other parties that are at the borderline of conspiracies theories . 
  the left wing extremist even copied the right wing `` front national '' by rebranding themselves `` front de gauche '', 
  to be fair , conspiracy theory are actually often propaganda tools . 
  see [ operation inefktion ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/operation_infektion ) by exemple . 
  [ pro-ukraine activists defy harassment to rally in town on russian border ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/apr/21/ukraine-activists-rally-khartsyzk-russia-joe-biden ), 
  considering how it is getting occupied by russian forces , i think it is safe to assume it is one of these eastern european country . 
  considering how the russian were quick to use the ceckpoint shooting to exacerbate tensions , it should be obvious they have no intent of desescalating . 
  georgia , armenia and azerbadjan are more in caucasus to me .

  i was n't judging your specific case , it just sounds anachronistic to me . 
  something going against the human rights is a bit disturbing to me , but if it works out to you guys , so be it !, 
  the netherland is a decent country with decent people , it 's completely your business and i respect it . 
  i just find it really fancy , even as a frenchman , 
   marechaussee oh , is that a word in dutch ? 
  really cool !, 
  the simple fact that people are entitled money from taxpayers and huge assets ( from former taxpayers ) because they were born in the right family should be disturbing .

  this is how you sell weapons , now give this man a beer !,

  as an honorable mention , i would add the plot of ghost recon . 
  it is extremely similar to the south ossetia conflict of 2008 .

  maybe in the middle of the socialist party member it was n't obvious , but he was even the favorite candidate of right winged electors . 
  he was the ** only ** decent candidate the socialist party could have . 
  oh okay , i did n't understand the question that way . 
  usually head of parties are perceived as the best candidate for their respective wing . 
  the socialist party has done primaries elections to elect their represent at the last election ( mainly because the best candidate , dsk was runned out ) . 
  in the end it 's not that important where you come from , as long as you have a decent place in your own party .

  i love to think of it the same way , 
   definitely not , unless you talk about puting your name at the top of your work is n't it part of teaching in some way ? 
  teacher would have it easier if they would remember us by our first name . 
  and people keep using this order in their email address for instance . 
  i only see that from french people . 
  really , because i do n't know if you remember , we are taught in school to always put surname first ... 
  how is that even possible ? 
  i mean , okay maybe people migrated but culture ca n't survive that long . 
  i also always wondered how japanese could be so similar to fins . 
  i love both cultures and always met fantastic fins . 
  we do that in france as well . 
  at least it was used to be the formal way to call people in official documents . 
  care to expand ? 
  i 'm really not aware of this `` fact '' . 
  sooo ... sky news is the british equivalent of fox news ? 
   sadly , nazism is relevant in this conversation . 
  so a couple of graffiti are enough to associate any crime with nazi germany ? 
  if isis would put swastikas everywhere , we should blame the germans then ... 
  sorry but i just can not associate modern day germany and germans with nazism . 
  so for you it 's perfectly fine to say germans = nazis ? 
  sorry but i just ca n't . 
  a couple of graffiti done by kids or morons has not so much to do an extreme political party ruling the country and committing mass murders . 
   you should also not hate the journalist . 
  why that ? 
  but their asset keep losing value ( including housing ) , ( over ) inflation makes also the currency less valuable compared to other . 
  impacting our exportations . 
  maybe i put too much importance on those factors .

  they 're elected for national mandates based on domestic agendas , they do n't have any legitimacy in taking decisions at the european level . 
  france inherited a large army it always had had , and is conducting operations beyond its borders which give it an incentive , it did n't create it out of the blue , which would be significantly harder . 
  to me , poland catching up economically seems more of a priority , especially since the threat of russia is very overstated , but poles may have a different view . 
  2 % seems reasonable ( that number is completely arbitrary though , i do n't understand people that make it the ultimate goal ) , the original post referred to increasing spendings by 20 times , that 's why i was talking about high levels . 
  ww2 never was unlikely ... 
  the geopolitical and cultural landscape are also so much different that any comparison is n't worth it . 
  poland does n't seem to have any reason to drastically increase its defence spendings , especially when it has other priorities . 
  this does n't mean it should n't have a reliable army , but there 's a middle ground . 
  putin is n't going to react based on 50 years old geopolitics . 
  both the european council and the council of ministers are n't elected ( directly nor indirectly ) , and those hold substantial powers , one defining the trends of european politics and the other having legislative power . 
  any revision of the treaties is up to the european council . 
  to summarise , in `` elementary school '' ( 6-10 ) we studied mostly grammar as far as i remember , which i guess must be quite similar to portuguese , in `` middle school '' ( 11-14 ) both grammar and literature , and in `` high school '' ( 15-18 , but french classes stop at 17 for most students ) only literature . 
  that last one would be studying texts and literary movements principally , placed in 4 categories : novels , poetry , theatre and argumentation . 
  tertiary education is pretty complicated in france , some schools only require a `` letter '' where you describe your motivations , but others make you pass a competitive exam , and dissertations ( essays ) are a big part of them usually . 
  half the threads here are about russia , i do n't know how you * can * agree . 
  that 's pretty stupid . 
  i was specifically talking about the european union , where people in charge are n't elected , and thus are n't speaking for anyone . 
  i do n't think elections give any will to the elected to represent those they 're meant to , let alone the whole nation , but that 's another subject , probably czech politicians are n't stupid enough to go against 85 % of their country . 
  that 's democracy for you . 
  we did n't , we just sadly happen to live in an undemocratic state . 
  and over the course of the years he did anything he could to get back the few powers he relinquished . 
  about the same , but also the presidents of both houses and instead of 1/5th it 's 60 mps from one house . 
  the fn is quite outspoken against it , as far as saying they would remove the law if they come to power , but they only have 2 mps and those did n't even bother showing up . 
  the verification by the constitutional council is n't automated though , there needs to be a procedure . 
  we do n't , and it 's a joke . 
  probably not , since the plate is n't backwards , there must be [ different ] ( http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-jxtnqbhp5ie/typpnhymzii/aaaaaaaadus/x-ffade94n0/s640/dsc_0279.jpg ) [ models ] ( http://police-car-photos.com.s3.amazonaws.com/3893.jpg ) . 
  we saw a good deal of constitutions since 1830 , you probably mean the charter . 
  but would she have any real political power ? 
  what makes you think your personal experience has more value than a survey ? 
  i could oppose you a very different experience , it would n't make any of us right , because we 're bound to the subjectivity of our environment . 
  a poll tries to avoid that by using a representative sample , you may say this one was badly conducted , but certainly your experience is n't a proof . 
  probably not that much , if any . 
  did i say that ? 
  both are n't justifiable , but they 're not the same . 
  stop being binary . 
  edit : i misunderstood what you were saying , sorry . 
  yes they try to justify it with reasons , they have to obviously , hatred is n't a natural thing . 
  that does n't mean those are any justification , but that * they * justify it that way . 
  not really , maybe the domains of hatred are somewhat similar but the reasoning and objectives are very different . 
  atheists make up the vast majority of the youth and a good part of older people , so there really is n't a problem at all . 
  things are pretty balanced for now , but it will be interesting to see how religious people are treated when they will become a clear minority . 
  people not speaking french are reading you , there are other places for that . 
  yeah ... not at all . 
  france supported the uk actively during the war by giving them the codes of the very missiles it sold to argentina some years earlier . 
  it would be a difficult not to do otherwise anyway , what with france having also retained several colonial possessions , of which mayotte is claimed by the comoros . 
  france has always sold arms to dubious countries , it is n't on the same ground as trust . 
  does n't work if they 're orthodox . 
  it 's arguable it 's the role of governments to recognise genocides , such a number is n't very telling . 
  in its core , fascism is about the control of society on every scale and the will to create a `` new man '' , away from the decadent individual of the liberal democracy . 
  maybe that 's what the fn secretly wants , but then they 're hiding it very well . 
  they proclaim their attachment to the republic , they do n't use violence to get their way , they are n't making mass ceremonies , and even if both the father and the daughter are `` charismatic '' figures , they are n't praised the way fascist leaders were . 
  just look at the recent conflicts between them , such a disunion would never have been allowed in a fascist party . 
  what you 're describing is merely populism and nationalism ( and xenophobia but it 's often linked to those ) , not that it 's better , it 's just not fascism . 
  the fn is n't fascist , and is n't in any position of power as of now . 
  as some already stated , its rise is completely unrelated to terrorism , so that does n't make sense to use it to compare the reactions between the us and france . 
  if you want to do that , the current laws getting passed increasing internet control would be more suited . 
  not in / r/europe , or you would be the one getting upvoted . 
  obviously it all gets down to personal preferences . 
  we still are !, 
  because people are more likely to cross a border than a sea , though that does n't explain spain and portugal . 
  yes , definitely . 
  make no mistake , france has in effect a presidential-ist system , parliament is a complete subordinate to the government , and even more so since 2000 when their elections were set at the same time . 
  it 's even worse than in a presidential system because you do n't have the separation of powers it allows . 
  personally i 'd prefer a parliamentary system because i view debating and responsibility of the government as more democratic than personal and unchecked power , however chosen by election it was . 
  i find it sad that parliamentarism has been discredited forever in my country because it was badly implemented and practiced , when there are numerous examples in neighbouring countries where it works very well . 
  then it does n't mean anything at all , other european countries already had abolished slavery on their soil during the middle ages . 
  that is not . 
  whether you stop immigration or not , you 're still left with many immigrants that you ca n't just remove from here , so you have to deal with that issue . 
  these are very different cases . 
  of course secularisation will not happen when religion is pushed for by an islamist state and the majority of the population happens to have that religion which is native to the area ... people immigrating to secular countries where the state rather pushes atheism than religion and where their religion has no roots ? 
  it 's way more likely to happen . 
   obsessive preoccupation with community decline , humiliation or victimhood there is some of that surely but i do n't think it is to the same extent . 
   cults of unity , energy and purity i do n't think so . 
   a mass-based party of committed nationalist militants the power in russia is way more `` oligarchian '' than populist , you 'll never find [ that kind of events ] ( http://www.history.co.uk/sites/default/files/styles/16_9_responsive/public/nuremberg%20rally.jpg?itok=auyyti6_ ) there . 
  it may have some populists inspiration , but it 's not really the core of putin 's authority . 
  and no militants either , the power is staying at the top . 
   abandons democratic liberties this is another major difference . 
  putin wants to maintain the illusion of democracy while fascists were denouncing fervently the decadent liberal democracy . 
   they did n't win any `` departement '' in the last elections while the rest is true , this has to be nuanced . 
  majoritarian voting systems advantage considerably the biggest parties . 
  this is n't like it 's inconsistent with her line . 
  fn voters ( who vote for their program and not because they 're sick of the frontrunners ) , are probably mostly favourable to becoming closer to russia . 
  fascism is dead and buried , something does n't need to be fascist in order to be nationalistic and authoritarian . 
  also , stalin killing most of the soviet high command did n't help when germany invaded . 
  those are people , it does n't mean there was a continuity in the system . 
  those were n't sacrifices . 
  regions were created in the 50s . 
  some nuance please , the usa meddling in europe is not something to wish for , but it 's nowhere comparable to the deeds of the soviet union . 
  never said it was , i 'm saying that 's what we 're trying to prevent when you 're only seeing unjustified arrogance . 
  as for your second point , i do n't think it 's really that common , bad experiences tourists have in france tend to get overblown on this site . 
  who is refusing that ? 
  when will people understand the issue is in putting english before native languages , not using a lingua franca ? 
  well , the west not having put in place or supporting dictators would have helped witg corruption , and civil wars would be less likely had the current borders not be drawn by colonial powers without regards to the local realities . 
  also , exploiting africa as a source of natural resources left the possibility of economical and social development more difficult . 
  obviously not everything is the fault of `` evil european imperialists , eternal shame '' , but denying the consequences of colonialism and foreign involvement on the continent is being rather dishonest . 
  there 's some disagreement amongst historians on whether it could rather have its origins in the american flag , which was the country of liberty of the time . 
  we were n't taught anything in school as far as i remember . 
  * journey to the end of the night * by louis-ferdinand celine . 
  his point holds if you look at louis xvii . 
  the problem here is that putin 's father was n't considered the rightful monarch .

  thus , unless a very significant share of the law 's subjects decide to not follow the law , making it unenforceable , the law simply works even if some people infringe the rules . 
  having such a significant share of people infringe on the law is such a rare event that it 's not a permanent risk undermining the rule of law at its core . 
  international law does n't have a coercive power enforcing it . 
  as it does n't have a coercive power enforcing it , it needs its subjects to voluntarily respect its rules . 
  that 's why it 's international law and not merely promises . 
  but if a single party decides to not follow the rules , then it 's not law anymore . 
  as having a single party not following the rules is enough to make it unenforceable , you 'll run into this problem all the time . 
   if you disobey , and even move have positive results , it might give other countries ideas to disobey as well . 
  exactly . 
  they 'll disobey as well . 
  how are you going to make an international union of 28 countries work if each of them is keen on disobeying the rules it agreed upon before when they feel like it ? 
  it simply ca n't work . 
  thus you wo n't have an european union anymore with such a high level of cooperation . 
  if you do n't play by the rules , there is no way that everybody will happily play by the new rules with you later , thus any new rules would be worthless . 
  hypothetically , they might play by the new rules with you later if you are powerful enough to force them to do so , but such hypothesis would n't look much like a peaceful cooperation between sovereign states though . 
  law is a mean to peacefully resolve conflicts and disputes . 
  if 28 countries are working together , there will necessarily be conflicts and disputes . 
  if a country refuses to play by the rules , then you ca n't peacefully resolve conflicts and disputes anymore . 
  thus , these 28 countries wo n't have the ability to work together as closely as before . 
  what 's even the point of negociating new rules while disobeying the current ones ? 
  even if you manage to reach an agreement on new rules , they will be worthless if you ca n't force the parties to follow them through law . 
  cameron 's demands were kind of tame in comparison to what m\u00e9lenchon is aking for . 
  at least , the british government adopted a very legalistic approach . 
  for example , they are still paying their agreed annual contribution toward the eu , and are still following scrupulously the treaties . 
  m\u00e9lenchon is explicitely saying that if he does n't get things going his way , france should stop paying its contribution on the spot , stop respecting the treaties and by the way , he also wo n't respect them even before the negociation 's beginning . 
  rough translation :  `` there 's no democratic choice against the european treaties . '', 
  by saying such , president of the european commission jean-claude juncker himself set the framework of the tyranny he 's exercising . 
  our programme is n't compatible with european treaties ' rules that impose budgetary austerity , free-market and the destruction of public services . 
  in order to apply our programme , we will have to break the treaties ' rules right after taking office , by enacting safeguard mesures aimed at protecting the french people 's sovereignty . 
   the populists are a problem , but only because the non-populists are stagnant careerists . 
  macron pledged that at least half of the candidates his movement will present for parliamentary election will be people that were neither candidate nor elected officials before , thus wo n't be careerists politicians . 
  for example : c\u00e9dric villani ( mathematician ) or jean-michel fauvergue ( former director of the french police 's commando ) . 
  also , even amongst those that are professional politicians , macron 's position allow him to separate the wheat from the chaff . 
  for example : he 'll keep jean-yves le drian ( appreciated and consensual socialist defense minister ) but wo n't keep manuel valls ( unpopular socialist prime minister ) . 
  but non-careerists politicians and a renewal of our political elite is n't the main thing m\u00e9lenchon 's supporters are looking for . 
  it would be especially strange considering that m\u00e9lenchon 's political career has been continuous since the 1970s . 
  what they are looking for is a non-racist protectionist alternative , and more social rights ( workers ' rights , earlier retirement etc. 
  which it probably is : a man with psychiatric disorders beated his neighbour and killed her . 
  unless there are political motives or unless the victim or the agressor are publicly known , it actually is `` local crime '' . 
  the agressor 's and the victim 's race does n't make it any different . 
   not that the older gentlemen with their nieces on the few other occupied tables seem to care . 
  germany never paid trillions in reparations after both world wars . 
  they actually paid 23bn marks after ww1 until 1931 ( equivalent to slightly less than 6bn dollars at the time , or something between 80 or a 100bn current dollars ) , and never paid significant reparations for ww1 since then . 
  after ww2 , germany paid a few billion dollars ( do n't remember how much , probably between 10 and 15 ) . 
  western powers took around 500 millions in goods ( mainly industrial tools ) until 1949 and then stopped . 
  the soviets took much more though but it 's hard to know how much . 
  the main economic asset paid by germany in reparations might have been patents , used notably by the us industry . 
  nevertheless , they never paid trillions in reparations . 
  according to historian and economist albrecht ritschl ( and it 's a consensual idea ) : `` germany was the biggest debt transgressor of the 20th century '' . 
  that 's also why they managed to rise again twice . 
  germany paying trillions to its victims is a myth . 
   my mother pays 70 $ for 300mb dsl , hundreds of tv channels what is 300mb dsl ? 
  are you talking about brandwidth ( 300mb/s down ) or a data cap of 300mb ? 
  i do n't think that it 's tied to deep cultural french roots . 
  on the contrary , france was the first country to experience demographic transition , and thus lacked a demographic boom during the 19th century due to early low fertility rate . 
  france had 29 millions inhabitants in 1800 , more than russia . 
  if france had experienced the same fertility rate as the uk , or norway , or most european countries , current french population would be around 175 millions instead of merely 65 . 
  since the last decades though , our fertility rate is slightly higher than most of europe . 
  our expensive family policies might have done something right , as it 's the most expensive one in the world after the uk , denmark and just before sweden . 
  benefits mostly kick in after the second child , not after the first one , which means that children have a low marginal cost ( hehe ) after the first one . 
  tax policy also helps families a lot over childless people . 
  there 's not much stigma for having kids in an unmarried household ( we have the highest rate of birth outside of marriage of any developped country ) , and there 's no pressure on mothers to force them to stay at home in the general population . 
  they still often have to balance their career with their children , but it 's not as clear-cut of a choice as having to chose between being a mother and having a career at all . 
  it 's probably several reasons interwinned but there 's no clear cut difference with other northern or western european countries though neither culturally nor politically . 
   in the end macron 's centrist positioning makes him the perfect first round candidate , and a pretty bad second round one . 
  in 2002 , le pen ( father ) was seen as a wannabe-mussolini or franco by 80 % of the population . 
  any candidate even slightly to his left from chirac to way further like jospin was sure to win with a score apt for a banana republic . 
  a guy like fillon , even with his corrupted reputation , or m\u00e9lenchon with his quasi-communist reputation according to right wing voters , would still have crushed le pen with a huge margin . 
  chirac won with 82 % . 
  every single left wing voter went out to block the road to the presidency to a fascist . 
  in 2017 , macron seems to be the only one with a decent margin against le pen . 
  many right wing voters now consider that le pen is n't that fascist after all , and a growing number of left wing voters do n't want to choose between what they see as `` ultra-liberalism '' and fascism . 
  but nonetheless , macron should still manage to get more than enough voters on both sides in second round , because of his centrist positioning . 
  a less centrist candidate like m\u00e9lenchon or fillon ca n't say as much , unlike in 2002 . 
  if there are 1,000,000 women in a country , and 15 % of them are immigrants with a fertility rate of 3 , they 'll theoretically have 450,000 children during their years between 15 and 49 years old , not each year . 
  they 'll give birth to around 13,000 children each year . 
  at the same time , the natives will give birth to 37,500 children each year . 
   the reason it 's poorly paid is because realistically anyone could do it . 
  anyone could do it , but not so many people could do it well . 
  likewise , anyone could learn to play piano , but not so many people could play piano so well that people are ready to pay to listen to them . 
  everyone knows the huge difference that there is between great and bad teachers . 
  the difference with primary school teacher comes from the fact that the government , which pays the teacher , does n't really care about the quality of their teaching skills . 
  the government just cares about having enough teachers , not spending too much and making sure that its teachers are not absolutely awful . 
  but if they are good , mediocre or simply bad , then it 's fine . 
  that 's why it 's low skilled : being a mediocre or bad teacher is low skilled , being a good teacher is n't . 
   the purpose of this low salary for teachers is that you are supposed to want this job because you love what you do and want to make a difference with the children . 
  the purpose is to reduce government spending . 
  by your logic , the best way to recruit strongly committed doctors and surgeons would be to give them a mediocre pay . 
  actually , the exact opposite is happening all around the world : as you want the best and most committed people to be doctors and surgeons , you ensure that they are very well paid . 
   the stereotypical capitalist boss that hires chidren to work in the coalmines to save cost , is he against all logic going to discriminate against women for some reason ? 
  obviously , the capitalist boss is ready to pay his workforce 20 % more in order to enjoy a sausage fest . 
  it 's kind of strange that nobody tried to employ a purely female workforce in order to undercut any competition until now . 
  even racist nba team owners in racially segregated america ended up drafting african american players when their competitors started to do so , tried to collude in order to block this crushing new competition and ultimately failed . 
  it was built between 1892 and 1894 . 
  it was n't even a radio tower , because radio towers did n't even exist at the time . 
  it used to be just a display of modernity . 
  i 'm sure the train will make us closer , unless it takes another century to finish it . 
  making the trip in 2 hours instead of 4 hours will change the relationship between both cities a lot . 
  it will be possible to go there in the morning , spend the day in italy doing business or drinking bicerin , and then be back at home at the end of the day . 
  the tgv changed widely the relationship between lyon and paris ( and the duration used to be around the same , went from around 4h to less than 2h ) .

  must have been quite the display in the north , 
  to be entirely fair i do n't think it 's actually linked to the bombing campaign , despite what it looks like . 
  i mean take it the other way : which country did not ~ ~ successfully bribed ~ ~ attempted to bribe sarkozy ? 
  xd half of his campaign funding has been labeled of `` curious origin '' by various accountants . 
  ( no joke ), 
  damn should have painted those planes :d nice shot tho, 
   this is quite rich , considering the eu still ows the uk almost # 20bn in missed payments . 
  that 's accounting fraud on the uk side . 
  you ca n't possibly tell me straight faced that 's it 's normal that you pay 30 % less than italy , which is a bankrupt country heading the same way than greece . 
   put your tinfoil hat away . 
  i 'm afraid the ukip funding , neither the invasion of ukraine , were not tinfoil . 
   how does an eu army not undermine nato if it will have ultimate control over nato troops ? 
  it does not have control over `` nato '' troops '' . 
  instead of handing over all their soldiers and supply to american nato generals and abandonning the question , countries will make standardization and cooperation plans on their own too with their neighbors . 
  the reason why france had to leave nato after wwii was because the us gov of that era basically asked us to hand over all our troops and ressources and basically abolish our own staff , military procuration , custom hardware etc. 
  now we 're not at that point just yet ; but we need to be able to feed or equip our soldiers if nato generals are all ordered out by dc . 
   have i stumbled into / r/conspiricy by accident ? 
  you sound like a total loon . 
  i 'm going to laugh because one of those day banking statements of prominent ukip and media owner people will end up leaked to wikileaks if this goes on . 
   the eu rebate is a correction which the uk gets to solve an imbalance in the system let 's cut the chase . 
  between the rebate , the payments ending up `` late '' , `` banking accidents '' , curious gdp calculations 20 % below reality , and simple fraud on what has been declared on the uk budget and what has been paid to the eu , half the money that should have been paid to the eu has simply disappeared en route in a blackhole . 
  * you are de facto paying 30 % less than bankrupt italy . 
  *  you ca n't suddenly start claiming that we are n't paying members when we have paid everything we were asked to contribute . 
  whether you are in the exact letter of the law or not , when countless billions of # / $ of contribution money have disappeared in a couple decades years after years , i will call that corruption and fraud . 
  a bit like when apple & mcdonalds are above taxes but `` it 's not fraud it 's legal '' . 
  right . 
   what does this even mean ? 
  you pretend that opposing an eu army is the uk 's interests . 
  except it is n't . 
  it is the interest of the kremlin , that is bribing ukip-aligned politicians to push such an idea in uk politics . 
   none of those people are members of ukip ... you are playing with words once again . 
  yes they do not hold party card , but they do run exactly the same agenda , policy , and i would n't be surprized if they shared some of that foreign funding . 
   you claim that the eu army wo n't undermine nato , but then you go on to say that the eu army will be sovereign . 
  no , i claim that an eu army is needed because the current plan is `` let america handle the entire defense '' and that if trump surrender to the russians that is going to mean `` the eu has officially no army , no staff , no commanding officers and no chain of supply willing to hold it 's border '' . 
   it is our concern if it is weakened by the eu . 
  it is my utmost concern that the corruption gnawing at the uk and the extreme amount of cynism there is simply beggining to endanger the entire european union . 
  by trying to veto the european common defense policy , you are endangering us all . 
  in which case , the best interest of the most toxic member that has been scaming its way out of paying it 's due , and has several ministers funded by foreign money ; might end up secondary compared to the long term safety of the european union . 
   i ca n't believe that a french person would be arguing in favour of an eu army without britain . 
  i am openly starting to question whether `` the uk are just defending their interest '' is n't a cover up to ask the kremlin for more bribe money in exchange for sabotaging our defenses . 
   you realise that your country will be providing the bulk of the forces , yes ? 
  that is ( partly ) why we have built our army to such extent , yes . 
   as long as the uk pays billions to be a member of the eu , they have a right to vote how they please - just like any other member state . 
  well yeah about that i guess if it really comes to that we can actually put back on the table the payment fraud . 
  because , no , you did n't paid like the others . 
  you might want to check that one out . 
  if only to quote the self awarded retroactive `` tatcher discount '' which everyone had politely aknowledged as a gesture at the time . 
  then there is all that somewhat original declared gdp tinkering to lower asked payments too that 'd make irish accountants proud . 
   the uk government will do what they think is in the countries best interests second problem . 
  european states are also aiming for the collective eu best interests . 
  not just the interests of a few corrupt politicians who like counting their roubles and stealing money . 
   as long as they are a member which you will soon not be anymore since last i heard you were leaving either way ? 
   ukip does n't have nearly as much influence on the uk as you seem to think they do boris johnson and davies or liam fox where both toeing an oddly similar line last i heard . 
   which one will hold the higher authority ? 
  eu authorities in the eu . 
  not nato . 
   nato wants to deploy troops into a country , but the eu does n't ... what happens ? 
  eu countries & bruxelles are sovereign . 
   nato is basically the eu plus several other strong nations . 
  you are willfully trying to misrepresente the situation . 
  both the chain of command and the logistics are massively dominated , if not monopolized by the us armed forces . 
  removing them ( e.g : in case of abrupt unilaterral withdrawal ) without another staff reading to take over instead would essentially defacto behead nato . 
  which is obviously what putin would count on . 
   it makes no sense to make nato weaker in favour of a smaller european alliance . 
  in no case you are concerned anyway since you are currently working on leaving the european union . 
   i do n't know where people on / r/europe get the idea that brexiters want the rest of europe to suffer . 
  no i think the wannabe puppet master behind them chose to ignore for ego reasons that several of his advisers are paid by the kremlin which does neither has always the eu nor the uk 's ( let alone nato 's ) best intentions in mind . 
  sarkozy had tried a metaphor ( a rethorical comparison ) and erh , lost himself in the picture and started going astray in the fancy words . 
   `` if you want to become french , you speak french , you live like the french and you do n't try and change a way of life that has been ours for so many years , '' sarkozy said , emphasizing the importance of immigrants embracing french values . 
  he might have a point tho . 
   if french identity has changed radically over the centuries , the implication seems to be that the frenchmen of the past were n't really french . 
  well excuse me . 
  we kindah had a number of royal douches in power that destroyed the more advanced roman era and brought it down to an analphabetic bathless concreteless potablewaterless dark age for 99 % of the population by enforcing book religion at sword/gun point and as a result we felt like showing them the door when people starved too much on top of it . 
   really ? 
  louis xiv ? 
  montaigne ? 
  all not french ? 
  what were they then ? 
  1 \u00b0 ) a giant douche 2 \u00b0 ) somebody living under a giant douch 3 \u00b0 ) another victim living under the giant douch era, 
  i assume this is going to fly so well with the anti immigration crowd and rupert murdoch ( wait where n't you lads telling us that you opposed even the visa free because , supposedly , `` 10 millions ~ ~ poles ~ ~ turks are going to move in london in 2 years '' ? 
  and now you want them in by yesterday , i have to admit i find that curious ), 
  hi from europeans ;-), 
  with all due respects , please , remind me , why do the people that howl to the wind they want nothing to do with the eu thinks they should decide how other eu countries should run their own military against their very own wishes ? 
  nobody will force the uk to join something like that . 
  you do n't want to join an eu army , we get it , no issue . 
  but i do n't see how the uk that are abandonning the eu have a voice on other countries internal defense projects ; especially in light that they might have to prepare to make do without any assistance from the uk ( and so rely on the rest of the eu instead ) . 
  edit : and to be blunt i 'm saying this because when i read `` it 's to undermine nato '' ; i know where that argument is coming from ( ukip handlers & consorts ) . 
  still with respect ; there is a serious risk that if trump is elected he might pull all his troops away from europe and/or surrender to the kremlin ( like the original yanukovich plan , imagine at the end of a second trump mandate ... like roughly 8-9 years from now ) . 
  in which case it would be preferable to have an already operational in-europe chain of command & supplies ; instead of relying only on withdrawing americans . 
  so of course some brexiters would love to see us deadly dependant on nato just to pull the rug from under our feets . 
  they 're litterally paid to push for that . 
  i definitely regard the americans as allies and partners , and i would rather avoid another major war with another major power ( read : russia trying to walk in the baltics ) if we can avoid it ; but i 'd rather we 'd be able to stand on our own legs if the need appear . 
  that said , more prosaically it 's unlikely to be needed soon , but it 's better to start planting the trees now ... 
   the reason they are protesting is because of deceases / lack of vaccination of the refugees . 
  ah , makes sense . 
  in france we had mandatory vaccination campaigns in schools at regular intervals . 
  maybe they can do the same ( take a morning and mass vaccinate the kids ) ? 
  vaccination prices in bulk are actually pretty low ( like a few $ per dose ) and if it comes to that maybe the rest of the eu can pitch in a few bucks ... ( \\* waves at msf * \\ ), 
  well yeah i guess romanian miners do n't have to constantly spend their lives doding police forces and manufacturing alibis or framing rivals for all the money they stole day long in their career . 
  buddying with the mafia probably is n't good for life expectancy either .

  by extensions , * there 's nothing new under the sun * . 
   if you dont think that this kind of behaviour isnt fueling the oil for nationalisam and hate by the greek state ... idk what to say i never said it did n't , i literally said his actions are reprehensible and that he likely , or should have been demoted/investigated . 
  i actually agreed with you . 
   this was mostly a jest ;d , just to show that this kind of nonsensical behaviour can work either way . 
  realisticly sicily could call itself hellas whith this kind of argumentation greeks use today . 
  fun fact , in sicilly or another place in italy , a village claimed to be mostly of greek ancestry , having a small festival ? 
  or feast , whatever . 
   fact is that this republic was called socialist republic of macedonia for last 60 + years and noone said anything , and now its problem . 
  its like , idk , germany saying france cant be called france because germans consider themselves sole inheritors of old franks . 
  a bit stupid analogy , i know , but cant remember better ... that would be stupid . 
  point is that after so long time no neighbouring country can insist that you have to change the name of your country . 
  i am not from macedonia btw . 
  the problems is that before the war the greek government could n't do anything , or tito may have been annoyed and switched positions ( if other actions followed too ) which would have put greece in much shittier position . 
  after the war they did have talks but tito mostly ignored them and they stopped , otherwise it would have been a waste of time . 
  my whole point is not that the country must not be called macedonia , but that it ca n't be called * only * macedonia , because that 's the whole apple of eris situation . 
  cutting the apple in two does not satisfy one side or the other entirely , but both are somewhat satisfied and none is wronged . 
  it seems to me it ends in a simple conflict of beliefs , therefore i can only answer to you as such : i do n't agree with you \u00af \\ _ ( \u30c4 ) _ / \u00af, 
  perhaps , but if you do n't do it , then the other gets to be named potatoland and then you 're fucked for ever . 
  either way you 're fucked , so why not try to make it as painless as possible ? 
  the name of the region a * part * of fyrom own . 
  fyrom is not the entirety of macedonia , if it was there would have never been any issue whatsoever . 
  if they claim to be the people of macedonia , and call so the country , then by extension those outside of the country are not macedonians . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:macedonia_overview.svg this map highlights the unfairness of such a situation , as both in historic and in current geographic terms the regions is shared between both . 
  in france the people in the champagne region are called champenois . 
  these people have the right to the name because of the region but in no case as a name of ethnicity . 
  if the people of fyrom want to be called macedonians ( which in the first place is an invention of tito ) , they can be as a region , but in no way as a nation . 
  greece does n't oppose the macedonia being in the name ( the far right does ) but they oppose it being the only `` term '' of the name . 
  northern macedonia is not derisive , it 's not inaccurate and does n't rub anybody the wrong way , or if so i do n't know of them or why . 
  and i can not understand why , especially concerning it is a compromise for both . 
  greece does n't tell them what they can be called , they tell them what they * ca n't * called , not for some reason that dropped out of the sky , but for the reason that otherwise it argues the existence of the region macedonia as a being part of greece , partly . 
  i 'm all about having a compromise , but saying `` x is my name , deal with it '' is not a compromise . 
  why should they have to compromise you 'll ask ? 
  because that name is not their 's to take , it ** already ** belongs somewhere else , to the * region * macedonia . 
  and they can share it . 
  that 's the compromise . 
   however , just telling another country what it can or can not name itself , and throwing international tantrums when third parties recognize a country 's name , looks less like the behavior of a civilized country and more like something russia does when declaring foreign territory its own . 
  if your you are not being respected , what is left to do ? 
  peaceful negotiation , that 's what . 
  both parties may have their right , therefore both should be satisfied as much as possible , instead of saying fuck him and get everything . 
  because compromising is more civilized than turning a deaf ear . 
  i think i know my politics better than you think i do . 
  i know about those wars but they have nothing to do with the present issue . 
  additionally they are more closely tied to ethnic/cultural/religious differences than a mere naming difference . 
   as you say its an issue they want resolved ; you do n't resolve it by not accepting macedonian passports , or blackening their name during a basketball game , but by talk and compromise . 
  i couldnt find a fucking road sign for skopje when driving from thesalloniki ( an ottoman founded city btw ) . 
  that is not politics and diplomacy , it is children in courtyard fighting , and the bully molesting the small one for his perverse enjoyment . 
  denying passports does not happen often and is reprehensible for the person doing it . 
  the blanking of the name was done domestically and did not , absolutely not affect the people of fyrom . 
  i would say that the fans affected the greek people more than the blank space , since the blank space was targeted at the greeks while the fans targeted the greeks too . 
   ** thesalloniki ( an ottoman founded city btw ) ** now this for example is historical revisionism , thessaloniki was founded a bit after the death of alexander the great and through the byzantine empire was also called \u03a3\u03c5\u03bc\u03b2\u03b1\u03c3\u03b9\u03bb\u03b5\u03c5\u03bf\u03c5\u03c3\u03b1 if i got it right , which means co-reigning , as in being the second largest/most important city after constantinople . 
  as for the signs , what else can they do apart from writing fyrom ( writing skopje is silly , but that 's the governor 's fault , not the government ) . 
  as for your bully analogy , remember the bully used to be tito to which the greek government could n't say not . 
  so i guess that what 's done in a half assed way comes around . 
   it is an issue that western europe doesnt hear about , but to someone who follows balkan politics , it is something that pops up every few days . 
  ( macedonia cant get into nato because of greece although the fulfill all the requirements , etc. ), 
  they had 50 years to resolve it and they just remembered when yugoslavia collapsed , yeah ... really important question it must be ... few days is a bit much , i would say every few months , at the very least every several weeks . 
  also , macedonia does n't fulfill all the requirements , as solving this issue is a requirement . 
  they did n't just remember , they had put this problem since the end of the war , tito was just not listening . 
  why would he , he was more powerful . 
  greece a bully ? 
  perhaps , but not the first one . 
   one could point out that todays greeks ( hellas ) have nothing in common with greeks from 2000 years ago , as cullturaly they dont , after being romanised and ottomanised for 1500 years , just as todays slavic macedonians have nothing to do with alexanders and phillips macedonia . 
  if macedonia had bigger army than greece they could demand that greece doesnt use its name on the same grounds and logic as greece is using right now . 
  they have in common several things , for example the language which is directly descendant of the ancient greek . 
  there 's also parts of the culture , certain beliefs also were retained . 
  the greek were as much romanized as much as the romans were hellenized . 
  both took in things . 
  and same goes for your `` ottomanisation '' . 
  fully ottomanised people exist in turkey , those who were n't are in greece . 
  that is not because they randomly sprouted out of somewhere , it is because a lot of the culture and beliefs managed to survive ( some did n't even get repressed at all , depending on the place ) . 
  as for the name greece , fyrom ca n't do anything about it because the mere name greek was used for the people through the history . 
  not just since one random guy started saying it , not because of a couple of villages that came and went . 
  they were called greeks , as far as i know since the roman times . 
  and if you actually manage it , they will just pick hellenes , which would n't be as advantageous . 
  the point that i 'm trying to make is that the name macedonians today defines the inhabitants of a region , not a country . 
  if a country wants to take that name they are usurping it on very weak historical claims that do n't go farther than 100 years , robbing the other half 's identity . 
  if they want to get over this shitty issue there must be a compromise , as you said i believe , and calling it macedonia or republic of macedonia is not a compromise . 
  let me ask you something . 
  does northern macedonia/northern republic of macedonia/republic of northern macedonia satisfy you ? 
  either of the three , i do n't care . 
  if not , tell me , are you not in the northern part of the region ? 
  if so , why not take the name ? 
  do you want only macedonia or republic of macedonia ? 
  does that mean that thessaloniki is not part of southern macedonia ? 
  does that mean that the people there are not southern macedonians and that as whole they are not macedonians ( people residing in the geographical region of macedonia ) . 
  because as far as i know thessaloniki is not the capital of a country called macedonia , therefore they do n't bother you by stealing your name . 
  they are called macedonia internally in the administrative regional level , which you can also do too , by calling the souther regions of fyrom as macedonia !, 
  the way i see it it 's a win-win, 
  so you think that greece should name itself usa if it wanted ? 
  or allegheny perhaps ? 
  just because some were lax in their choices does n't mean others must be too . 
  especially since the whole naming dispute originates from a dictator wanting to instill a national identity to his people that did n't quite fit . 
  when did it happen if i may ask ? 
  because there are wars that started for less in europe . 
  that is the far right , if we take for granted everything the far right says then we are in a tight spot . 
  well i guess they are counting the days , do n't you think ? 
  the context here though is different , it 's the forceful separation of the same country , the same people . 
  the region of macedonia does n't share the same people and never did it share the same country , unless if we go back in time very far , which would be irrelevant . 
  which is not a fact that warrants the inaction of others in a similar situation . 
  also , ** could ** anybody refuse what castille impose ?

  you 're definitely wrong because i have been to several latin american countries and when they learned i was french people would often start a talk about europe and how they really wanted to see spain and france . 
  also , they literally call themselves `` latinos '', 
  oh i see you did mean romanians . 
  i was just so confused because i thought filthy begger actually meant filthy beggar and not hard-working fellow european . 
   romanians you mean roma , romanians are a latin people descended from the ancient romans and wallachians . 
  roma are a traveling people who came to europe from india around 1600 ad, 
  also worked for the united states , australia , canada , and japan . 
  note that european does not apply to latin americans / argentineans , canadians , australians , afrikaners , israelis and americans however , these people do have a special status with europe and their connection can not be disputed . 
  they should think of themselves as persons of european origin ( peo ) though and should not be denied the right to claim their heritage . 
   who is this money going to come from , and what is in it for them ? 
  after 2008 crisis , president obama announced a stimulus package of some $ 800 billion , to get this sum they simply printed more dollars . 
  it 's called ` quantitative easing ' europe could simply print more euros , it would generate jobs and battle our deflation ogre too . 
  maybe that 's how , i 'm not positive on that though . 
  or by printing more euros ... 
  i was talking about the millions who died in the bloodlands during wwii, 
  yea he heavily censored the media so he was portrayed well and his opponents not . 
  he also rigged the whole system to benefit himself politically . 
  please do n't , he is a good historian and a good man . 
  do n't defame him for you political goals , to do so is an insult to the dead . 
  yea have companies move in actually is good . 
  it was because his anger and disgust was so raw that i thought he must have had some real life experience, 
  that was the wrong doc . 
  please watch the correct one . 
  i 'm not talking about one event , i 'm talking about an organized movement . 
  the governments for sure do not want another dictatorship in europe , of that i am certain . 
  that 's not true , victor orban is the leader of an eu country and he has us all concerned . 
  viktor yanukovych was pro-eu until putin told him to stop . 
  it 's not that europeans or even european governments are okay with dictatorship in serbia it 's that there are a shit ton of crazy , terrible things happening in this world like islamic state and russian aggression and i think there is a real social desire to ** not ** interfere in serbian affairs because we had done so in the past and the serbs did n't appreciate it . 
  see , when you have an actual democracy ; organized movements with a reasonable , well researched cause really do get things done . 
  look at nuclear power in germany and look at the scottish independence referendum . 
  you know as well as i do that that is not true, 
  please watch this documentary it will tell you all about belarus and its current political reality . 
  it 's also really freaking good . 
  europe 's last dictator - http://vimeo.com/38684197 edit : here is the documentary i 'm talking about , the other one was a google fuck up by me, 
   shithole do n't say that , its a beautiful country with a rich history . 
  it 's more like one of those old time psychiatric hospitals where the patients have no rights and are constantly being manhandled ... except of course that no one is crazy, 
  that is one vital part of serfdom . 
  this is another key component . 
  this new law means that unemployed people in cities and elsewhere can be taken to work on farms or wherever . 
  one law keeps them in serfdom , the other law brings new blood into serfdom . 
  i 'm extremely disappointed that you really believe that . 
  i have always been a russophile , and have believed that although the kremlin is barbaric , the russians are not : they are civilized europeans with a intricate and beautiful culture ; but it seems like many russians on reddit actually support the kremlin . 
  any country can spin history to make them look like the victim . 
  we french could be decrying the british for thwarting our empire , the germans for fighting us , and the americans for encouraging the break up of our empire . 
  but we do n't , at least not on the scale that you all do . 
  and why do we not ? 
  because we have realized that working together and having a civil discourse about our mutual histories is far , far more beneficial . 
  this is serfdom . 
  i 'm not gon na lie , i always get a little bit hyped up with pride whenever i think about the roman empire and definitely feel a connection to fellow inheritors of the latin culture, 
  armenia is still aligned with russia, 
  it 's citizens want to be spanish . 
  i 'm going to take a guess and say that you are of pakistani or indian origin and have some real life experience with forced marriages ? 
   there 's a difference between being ruled over/subjugated and being discriminated against at every level of society . 
  uhhh ... romanians * were * discriminated against at every level of ottoman society for being christians and refusing to turkify  i love how many europeans are so quick to decry racism and discrimination until the roma are mentioned . 
  the reason for this is that roma , many roma , refuse to integrate and have refused to integrate for centuries . 
  the programs are there , if they want to settle down and join society the door is wide open for them, 
  it is grammatically incorrect though , definitely not the queen 's english, 
  it 's black american english , double negative work sometimes to add emphasis . 
  because then it would have been an act of madness ( as in psychosis ) and not an act carrying out traditional customs . 
  if you heard about a ethnic englishman slitting his fianc\u00e9es throat , you can better bet it 's because he went bat shit psychotic . 
  and yes , that does change the moral severity of the crime . 
   like shit and exclude them from normal society for centuries , this applies to romanians as well , asshole . 
  romanians , mainstream romanians , were dragged through the mud for centuries by the turks . 
  you know nothing of eastern european or balkan history , if you did you would know the burning hell those societies have been through . 
  not every country is like the united states , france , the uk , germany etc etc. 
  where the majority were well off and but minority groups were excluded . 
  there are countries were * the entire population * was oppressed , romania is one of these . 
   what the fu what the * fudge * . 
  victor orb\u00e1n is trying to turn hungary into a belarus . 
  we , as fellow europeans , ** can not ** let this happen . 
  if the situation in hungary degrades and becomes too repressive and authoritarian , i would want that to become france 's # 1 foreign policy priority . 
  oh yea had no effect in ukraine at all ... ... 
  sept , huit , neuf a pleasant surprise , gods honest truth ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ), 
   ukip leader nigel farage commented : `` to paraphrase mark twain ` rumours of our death have been greatly exaggerated . ', 
  the eurosceptics are now back with a bang , indeed we have never been away . 
  `` last week we were done over by the feds , [ european federalists ] but today the efdd group is alive obviously having friends in the very highest places . 
  in wireless terms ... the radio signal was weak for a few days but normal transmission has now been resumed . 
  `` european parliament president schulz 's part in trying to shut us down last week was contemptible . 
  it was manipulative backroom politics of the worst kind . 
  but in his eagerness to silence the eurosceptic voice he acted prematurely . 
  `` eu federalists will be sitting in a corner somewhere slowly rocking muttering the words ` please make the eurosceptics go away ' over and over . 
  we will now make the eu 's centralising fanatics regret their short-lived bout of hubris . '', 
  the man is a poet , you have to admit . 
  do n't ruin it . 
  this will be a big tourist draw once romania becomes a full fledged oecd nation . 
  / r/downtonabbey, 
   gi ' what sort of dialect madness is this ? 
   and that is relevant , how ? 
  because that 's a fucking crazy law ... how could the supreme leader allow such madness ? 
  it 's just butt-sex between 2 dudes , may be icky to some but jesus christ to kill people for that is downright murder , completely evil . 
   the tiny country that actively occupies and colonizes another nation . 
  and is armed with 80 or more nukes ? 
  please ... 
  i 'm not going to even get into this because the situation is complex . 
  but both sides have legitimate grievances . 
  the state of israel has a right exist and so does palestine, 
  it was actually a lot more complicated than that . 
  the shah was never installed because the shah never left !, 
  he was still the shah when new government was elected ( by an electorate of upper-middle class persian muslim males only ) . 
  it 's like how the queen of england is queen even if parliament changes .

  people protested/rioted yesterday night . 
  ( i 'm tired today , so please feel particularly free to correct any mistake i made this week ) . 
   it also falls to the reddit trap of overthinking everything so many people hate that he does n't have a clear plan so far ... 
  sorry for overthinking about the choice of our next president when we see that macron still does n't have a program . 
  elitist grumpy french leftists !, 
  oh you want macron to win !, 
  ... can you list 3 of his proposals , the ones that convinced you and might convince others ? 
  ( he still does n't have a program . 
  the first round is in less than 3 months , he created his movement almost 10 months ago and announced his candidacy 2 months ago ) . 
  oh you want macron to win !, 
  ... can you list 3 of his proposals , the ones that convinced you and might convince others ? 
  ( he still does n't have a program .

  ** france ** : politically-heavy week , i think it 's safe to say the presidential campaign has begun !, 
  * ( i keep talking about it , but never mention when it is : in 3 months . 
  1st round : 23rd of april , 2nd round : 7th of may ) . 
  * - ** today is the second round of the socialist party primary : hamon is likely to win against valls ** . 
  - last week , benoit hamon came 1st with 36 % of the votes , manuel valls 2nd with 31,5 % . 
  the 3rd candidate , arnaud montebourg , asked his supporters ( 17,5 % ) to vote for hamon . 
  most of the other candidates rallied behind valls , but their combined votes are less important . 
  mathematically , mamon is predicted to win . 
  - valls ' main line of attack this week was ... yes , of course : islam ( and women 's rights ) !, 
  ( valls and hamon both became famous politically as mayors of a town in the suburbs of paris . 
  but their conceptions of `` la\u00efcit\u00e9 '' , `` communautarism '' , security , etc differ . 
  valls agressively attacked hamon on this , accusing him of being `` ambiguious '' , of potentially compromising with radical islamists , a minister close to valls - asking not to be named - even said to journalists that hamon is the muslim brotherhood 's candidate ... 
  this is of course a pile of lies based on absolutely nothing , but the party did n't say anything , journalists barely called valls on it ) . 
  valls also continued to use the same argument as before : `` hamon is a dreamer , what he promises is unrealistic '' , etc. . . - the final debate was followed by 5,5 millions of people , which is way more than the 3 debates before the 1st round , but way less than the final debate for the right-wing primary in november . 
  hamon won the debate . 
  ( i 'm pro-hamon , but i think it 's objectively what most journalists recognized , even if the vast majority of them were clearly supporting valls ' arguments . 
  the polls said the same things ) . 
  fun fact : edward snowden apparently watched at least a bit of it , since he retweeted 2 tweets in favour of hamon ( he speaks french because he spent several years in geneva ) . 
  - i should also mention that there was some pretty big `` confusion '' with the results of the first round . 
  they screwed up big time , took days to actually look into the `` issues '' . 
  it 's probably because they were hoping for at least 2 million voters and only got 1,6 ... now the consensus , the official story reported by the media is that it was some sort of `` individual human mistake '' that was not meant to rig the results ... 
  i just stopped trying to understand . 
  - ** main story this week : fran\u00e7ois fillon 's wife 's alleged fake jobs ... and more !, 
  ** * ( i 'm going to do my best but it 's going to be long and may not be clear , i 'm not a journalist  . 
  please correct any mistake i might make , fellow french redditors ) . 
  * there are several layers to this story ( and it might get bigger ) : - ** fillon hired his wife as his parliamentary assistant ** in 1998 . 
  then from 2002 to 2007 , she was hired by another deputy when he became minister . 
  in 2012 , when he became deputy again , he hired her once more ( until the jer\u00f4me cahuzac case emerged and mps were forced to be more transparent about their income ) . 
  hiring family is legal in france for mps ( around 15 % of them do ) , but the trouble is that it looks like she did not actually work . 
  there are a few testimonies saying she was seen in the national assembly or that she did work for her husband in his constituency ... but the vast majority of people claim they never knew she was his assistant , including other parliamentary assistants , including a journalist who wrote a biography about fillon . 
  there are several interviews of fillon 's wife ( one very recent ) in which she says she never got involved in her husband 's work , she 's a housewife . 
  -  over the course of nine years , she earned around 500,000 euros . 
  an investigation was launched the day following the revelations . 
  - ** his wife also allegedly earned big money in 2012/2013 , for her work as a literary advisor in a magazine ** own by a billionaire , friends with many politicians , including fillon . 
  problem is : all that could be found to prove she did work for said magazine were 2 or 3 short book reviews . 
  the director of the magazine was stumped when he heard about this , saying he never met her . 
  -  in 2012/2013 , she earned 100,000 euros for that ( this time it 's not public money , but still ) . 
  - when he went on tv 2 days after the news broke out to defend himself , ** fillon revealed that he also hired 2 of his kids ** to do some parliamentary work for him , since they are lawyers . 
  problems are : you 're not allowed to hire several family members at the same time ; they were not yet lawyers at the time , but law students ; upon looking into what type of work they could have possibly been doing , journalists found nothing that could apply ( i do n't remember exactly but given the training they had , the law specialization they chose , journalists could not find any bill fillon had worked on during that period , any parliamentary work that would have required the help of someone with said curriculums ) . 
  -  i have n't read how much they got paid exactly , i do n't know if the detail is known yet . 
  - recently , another newspaper revealed that between 2003 and 2014 , ** senators ** of the ump party ( now called les r\u00e9publicains , since they had to rebrand themselves because of some other mediatic case ) had for years ** redirected public funds to themselves , for their private benefits ... fillon is alleged to be one of them ** !, 
  -  between 2005 and 2007 , fillon allegedly stole around 25,000 euros . 
  there is already an investigation for this as well , but for now fillon is not part of it , because it 's only looking into what happened after 2009 ( when he was no longer a senator ) ( i do n't know why that is , but i guess his case will probably be dealt with as well ) . 
  this is not covered very much by the media ( yet ? 
  it broke out later in the week , and once again it 's m\u00e9diapart and , weirdly , when it 's this newspaper , other journalists do n't pick up on the story as much . 
  it * is * covered , but i mean , the attention is mainly on the story about his wife and given that it 's also important , even if it 's way less money , it should be covered more than it is ) . 
  - finally , another layer that is almost not covered at all is ** his mysterious company ** called `` 2f conseil '' : we know very little about this but it looks sketchy as hell and so i hope maybe another major story will break out in the next few weeks . 
  it is a consulting company . 
  he 's the sole partner and we do n't know anything about his clients , so there could be some conflicts of interests with companies buying him in exchange of political favours . 
  some could be russians , given fillon 's political stance on poutine ... 
  when asked , fillon 's team only mentioned lectures he gave at an energy conference in kazakhstan , and other lectures in moscow and in iran ... then fillon denied it all and refused to answer the questions . 
  this is legal ... but only because he created it just 10 days before the beginning of his deputy mandate in 2012 . 
  ( it is illegal for deputies to start a consulting business while they are mp , but since he registered the statutes 10 days before , he 's okay ! ), 
  -  between 2012 and 2015 he earned over 600,000 euros . 
  [ so ... ** will he drop out ? 
  - i do n't know . 
  he said if he 's charged he will ** . 
  the investigation ( into the main story/ies ) has begun , but it will take a while , i 'm not sure how long , ** but he likely wo n't be charged before the 1st round of the election ** . ], 
  [ a note to add that fillon 's first line of defense was to say that the attack was misogynist    and that several quotes of his , about `` assistance '' ressurfaced ( and also some pretty sexist stuff he said in the past ) ... 
  i could go on and on , but this story is already so long ! ], 
  [ the newspaper which published the story also hinted that they may have more details to reveal very soon , so it 's probably going to go on on tuesday when next week 's `` canard '' is out . ], 
  [ fillon has a major rally planned tonight in paris . 
  his wife ( who has n't appeared in public yet ) is supposed to be there , as was planned ... 
  so she 'll be surrounded by cameras and likely wo n't say anything . 
  i do n't know why they chose this strategy . ], 
  ( the national front is being very quiet about all this , because they too are dealing with a similar investigation : european parliamentary assistants paid although they were actually working for the party , in paris , instead of in bruxelles , on the stuff they were supposed to be working on ) . 
  - ** emmanuel macron was accused of using his ministry 's funds to prepare for his campaign . 
  ** this is getting very little attention . 
  so he is being accused of having used important sums of money during evening meetings he had in the months before he quit his position as minister to launch his own movement and announce his candidacy . 
  ( it 's not clear : this money is to be used by the minister when he has lunch with people for instance , but people say he used it to meet with all sorts of people he was consulting on the side , to advise him on his political plans , form a strategy ... so for his own political career , as opposed to as the minster for economy ) . 
  - ** claude gu\u00e9ant , former sarkozy minister , was fined for also using public money ** . 
  i 'm tired , google it . 
  ( pretty heavy week , innit ? ), 
  ah maybe ... 
  i did n't check on this again . 
  i did n't hear nor read that the initial reports were maybe wrong ? 
  no : emmanuel macron created his own `` political movement '' ( this summer ) and announced he would be running for president ( in september if i recall well ) , so he did not take part in this primary . 
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------ so , on the `` left '' side of the spectrum , there are : emmanuel macron - `` en marche '' jean-luc m\u00e9lenchon - `` la france insoumise '' benoit hamon - parti socialiste ( if he does win next week , which seems likely ) * yannick jadot - europe ecologie les verts * * philippe poutou - nouveau parti anticapitaliste * * nathalie arthaud - lutte ouvri\u00e8re * listed according to the current polls , but take it with a grain of salt since they were quite wrong , again , about the results of this primary . 
  and because things are going to be evolving now that the presidential campaign is really beginning . 
  the ones in italics are small candidates who likely wo n't get more than 5 % of the votes ( their parties respectively got 2,3 % , 1,1 % and 0,5 % in 2012 ) . 
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ keep reading if you want more details . 
  so there are 3 main candidates on the `` left '' : m\u00e9lenchon reached 11 % in 2012 ( he 's currently predicted at a higher score , according to recent polls . 
  he 's attracting lots of people to his rallies , his youtube channel that he launched a few weeks ago is a real phenomenon . 
  but convincing more leftists to pick him as the strongest potential candidate for the left does not seem realistic and media coverage is n't favorable to him ... ... macron already has lots of supporters and attracts crowds to his meetings , but i think most of them are still uncertain at this stage ( mainly curious i mean ) . 
  however after the socialist primary , the race will really begin and we will probably see many socialists turn to him - because they are social democrats and do n't like hamon 's line ( voters , militants and also probably some politicians : how many ? 
  how many `` big names '' switching from the socialist party to `` en marche '' ? ) . 
  he 's got plenty of media coverage .

  i 'm sure it can be done . 
   no , i want countries to respect article 5 when it 's invoked , as per agreement . 
  article 5 does not state nuclear retaliation . 
  afghanistan was n't nuked , was it ? 
   go correct wikipedia so that was your source . 
   i 'm not sifting through your constitution . 
  if you do n't want to learn , do n't try to `` correct '' others man . 
  it 's not difficult . 
   whatever it can to help . 
  well up to now , what you could was very very little . 
   ance ca n't go and wage war on another country and expect nato to be like `` lol , okay france , here we come '' give me a call when france will ask the help of romania for anything , ok ? 
   it 'd be short lived and useless in the end because romania and ukraine alone can not fight russia . 
  but you want france to start nuclear war if estonia is invaded . 
  dude , do you listen to what you say ? 
   you armed forces are controlled by the prime minister did you just try to `` correct '' a frenchman on france ? 
  are you for real dude ? 
  here 's the consitution https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichtextearticle.do;?idarticle=legiarti000006527478&amp;cidtexte=legitext000006071194&amp;datetexte=20140401 you 're welcome . 
  no no . 
  showing your support the litteral fascists does not make you a fascist ... for some reason . 
  what is what about ? 
   at least we do n't actively support the annexation of crimea unlike a certain candidate for president in france . 
  who was talking about whataboutism here ? 
   and i suppose you 're currently in eastern ukraine , fighting like the true soldier you are ? 
  you 're the one that wants france to start a nuclear war if estonia is invaded . 
  you 're the supreme warrior ... letting others die for you . 
   we actually supported ukraine in their fight . 
  we sent it specialists to help ukraine in their cyber war with russia and did that bring a stop to the hostilities ? 
  you were claiming you 'd do anything to stop russian aggression and you send it people . 
   ) ) romania has no tanks ? 
  airplanes ? 
   do you expect people with far left views to be fired or are you just a partisan hack feigning outrage to silence your political enemies ? 
  i suggest that at the next italian election , you go vote for the person willing to remove these laws that bother you so much . 
  that 'll show your fellow countryman / u/thatguyfromb4 how wrong he is . 
  akshually the gladiators were given by maidens before a fight little bits of tissues made from [ mousseline ] ( https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/mousseline ) in order to show support . 
  the fighters would tie them to their spears . 
  and the more succcessful they were , the more tissues they 'd gather . 
  so showing your support for mousseline just means you wan na be successful in your endeavours . 
   most of your countrymen thought the afghanistan invasion was justified to prevent another 9/11 . 
  yeah . 
  now afghanistan is a stable country that is doing very well . 
   luckily you have no power . 
  i have just as much power as you do ... well actually more because majorities elect heads of states here . 
  one 's depressing with decrepit buildings , everything looks like it 's about to be demolished , full with brutalist buildings . 
  and the other is lyon . 
  yeah . 
  that 's why french soldiers died for your dumb war . 
  and i want to prevent that from happening again, 
   adventures myes . 
  you got to experience those adventures in berlin for example . 
   from r/news great sauce man , 
  well then explain to me how it was in france and uks best interest to start a war with germany ? 
   we do n't have nuclear capability and my hope would be that we would do anything within our power so that people in eastern europe never have to suffer atrocities under russian rule ever again . 
  so what did you do in ukraine ? 
  i did n't see your president fight for a resolution of that war . 
  what did you do in georgia ? 
  i did n't see your president fight to stop the invasion . 
   that 's what i would stand for . 
  yes . 
  keyboard warriors are not what we lack though . 
  you should check how ww2 started . 
  okay ... you went off topic a bit here . 
   because france is n't trying to persuade the u.s. to increase military spending . 
  you 're bitching about the help the us gave . 
  5 planes big shit . 
  heaven forbid a us soldier would have died in mali . 
  we 'd hear day in day out about your massive sacrifice . 
  also france is good . 
  we 've got our nukes . 
  we 're cool outside nato . 
   will uk or france , the only two countries with nuclear capabilities , one who 'll leave the eu and one who 's growing eurosceptic , risk a nuclear war with russia over , say , estonia ? 
  will romania risk a nuclear war over estonia ? 
   i am sure us will have zero problems manhandling us exactly the way they want to . 
  they tried to with iraq ... it failed badly . 
   a huge proportion of the air-to-air refueling and electronic reconnaissance flights for the libya thing were american . 
  you should learn some maths buddy . 
  the us provided 5 kcs and 5 c17s . 
  we had only by ourselves 5 kcs . 
  also we several transall c160s and c130hs . 
  you sound a wee bit salty buddy.https : / / en.wikipedia.org/wiki/operation_serval, 
   syria , mali syria ... you mean the place where you kicked shit right next door . 
  isis is largly composed of former baathists that could n't find a place in iraq and the fact that the new shia rulers of iraq were quite rutheless to the sunni which caused a sort of a civil war . 
  we warned you not to go there buddy . 
  and mali was minimal help . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/operation_serval heck why do n't we count the number of french soldiers that died in your afghanistan war buddy ? 
   provide ammo when europe runs out , or provide air transport for european forces . 
  in conflicts in which the u.s. is n't otherwise involved . 
  did the french provide help in afghanistan or did they not ? 
  why do we have to provide for you ? 
   if the eu can match the pentagon spending for r&d then sure , in a few good years we might match their expertise and technology . 
  until then you might say `` let them buy european products instead '' , france was n't born with capabilities to launch slbms , was n't born with top notch radars , capabilities to make nukes these things take time , money , help , etc. 
   staying power we do n't need no staying power since no eu country has plans to invade another country and remain . 
  in fact we should completely eliminate any desire to invade another country . 
   also not many nato members have the capacity to develop complex machines on their own and nobody has the huge inventory of the us armed forces to allow for low prices . 
  i agree . 
  monopolies are a great thing . 
  we should all depend on one single supplier and `` too big too fail '' has never proven to be a wrong strategy and has not cost us a lot of money . 
  and heck depending on the us is great . 
  like during the iraq war when france refused to go in , they restricted exportation of parts of the catobar as punishment . 
  see ... heavily depending on one country is great . 
   so you dotn care that russia manipulates your elections ?

  you do n't believe that you can be a socialist ( democrat ) and be against islam , as the canadian dude is . 
  you 've just proven my point . 
   is it the fault of finnish taxpayer that the greek state overspend and does n't collect enough taxes ? 
  as far as i know no one blames finland ( who could blame a country of 5 million people for crying out loud ? ) . 
  it 's either germany , the eu , the imf and at times , though rarely , france . 
  kudos to both of them for still being best friends even with a border like that . 
  sure . 
  perhaps spain does n't belong in that list but you 're kinda unpredictable at times , remember the gibraltar issue you guys suddenly brought up a couple of month ago ? 
  you 've decided to be a dick against the uk out of nowhere . 
  it depends . 
  be it islamic advocacy groups , be it arab nationalism in europe , ... 
  they all have links with either the labor party ( if they 're moderate ) or the communists . 
  a clash of two different political systems : that of northern european countries where governments abide by the rule of law and that of southern europe where everything is uncertain . 
  this is n't surprising for governments like greece , italy or ~ ~ spain ~ ~ . 
  it is for everyone else in western europe from france upwards . 
  * history * indeed . 
  both social democrats as extreme leftist groups such as communists ** today ** have befriended islamist groups all over western europe . 
  peaceful annexation . 
  glorious france would 've invaded finland if they ever tried that with us . 
  since we 're at it , we 'd burn down moscow too . 
  sure , pedophilia is a bigger problem among white men ** in freaking europe ** . 
  you 're not considered a socialist by western european standards , in fact , you 're a right wing nutjob . 
  edit : this is a sarcastic comment meant to criticize established european socialists . 
  i am in no way attacking / u/phallindrome, 
  the correct word is `` neutral '' , i 'm looking at you switzerland . 
   i 'm going to let you stop and think about this sentence for one minute , and then you can come back to let us know the logical fallacy that you 've discovered . 
  i 'm going to let you stop and think about how to have a discussion with people . 
  [ spoiler alert ] showing respect helps . 
  no true scotsman , yes . 
  a fallacy often used by muslims . 
  they 're easier to manage . 
  though i recognize the baltic states unique situation having russia right next door . 
   you 're being an asshole , by coming here trying to shit on the achievements of a small country that has been independant for a very short time , but has managed to make great strides forwards in most all fields . 
  it 's not about nationalistic feelings , it 's about celebrating the achievements of smaller players aswell . 
  i 'm celebrating the baltic states , these countries + poland i have the most hope for of all former eastern european states . 
  do n't say `` no offense '' if you 're planning to be offensive . 
   look harder then . 
  estonia beats france at pretty much everything except number of berets per capita . 
  sure . 
  you can believe whatever you want to believe . 
   maybe instead of being an asshole , be happy that a country that was annexed just 25 years ago and had to start from nothing is doing this well . 
  how am i being an asshole ? 
  because i 've high expectations for the baltic states ? 
  because i want you guys to do an even better job ? 
  i , in no way , meant to offend your nationalistic feelings , feelings that go against the spirit of the european union and this subreddit by the way . 
  oh , so it 's just a reddit thing ? 
  got it , thanks !, 
  yes and their hookers are probably , like in most western european countries , eastern european/russian/asian / african . 
  i 've read this a couple of times here , how realistic is this ? 
  is this just an / r/europe thing or are people from finland really interested in forming a country with estonia ? 
  have n't seen much from `` bestonia '' to be quite honest . 
  i expect more from a country with a population of just over 1 million that receives development funds from western europe . 
  morocco has been an ally for decades , even longer than eastern european countries who 're part of the eu today . 
   edit : also , judging all muslims by the actions of a few extremists is a shitty thing to do that 's like saying that we ca n't judge all nazi 's because hitler 's cleaning lady / neighbor / cook / road engineer / ... was a self-proclaimed nazi but had no idea what the nazis actually did and what they truly believed . 
  islamophobia literally refers to islam , not muslims . 
  we 're criticizing the ideology and * not * necessarily the people who 're following it . 
  switzerland is the quebec of europe to put things in perspective . 
   says the goddam french , one of the biggest weapons exporter in the world , that was the reason why the arms-embargo did n't happen for half a year , and ** who will go through with the sale of two goddam carriers the second the ukraine conflict is over . 
  ** something your morally corrupt country would n't do in a million years , if there 's money to be made , the swiss are there . 
  that 's the difference between france and switzerland . 
   'm not the defending that they greelit the deal , but all that talk about how to go fucking apeshit at switzerland and how we 're not the allies of the eu over such a minor thing is fucking ridiculous . 
  minor ? 
  this is n't the first time switzerland decides to backstab the eu and the west in general . 
  just keep doing your thing , switzerland . 
  just do n't be surprised it 'll eventually hit you in the face . 
  wrong . 
  the swiss side with the eu and the west in this conflict , as some swiss have said here as well . 
  what they think is that the rest will handle russia , they 'll just be opportunistic and make money out of it ( even though they hope that the west succeeds ) . 
  you ca n't be surprised that this causes animosity , not only with the eu , but also with the us , canada and australia . 
  sure , we 're so jealous of switzerland . 
   why do you think that so many people want to go to switzerland to live and work but you keep seeing hate and envy all across / r/europe [ 1 ] ? 
  newsflash : europeans go everywhere to live and work . 
  switzerland is n't the most popular destination , the uk and germany are . 
   switzerland is an example of how a small country can be extremely successful by just remaining neutral and handling business as business . 
   the problem is that everyone confuses our banks and certain types of industry with the people living here , as if you and i are somehow responsible for a ceo that sells guns to another country , or does some shady banking business . 
  well , the past referendum on the freedom of movement principle with the eu proves that there are lots of idiotic swiss too , it 's not only business . 
   just smile and nod , while being glad to live in switzerland . 
  they are the ones that hate us for not being us !, 
  are you 10 or something ? 
   / r/europe [ 2 ] is just a lite version of / r/european [ 3 ] sure . 
  that 's not what neutrality means , at least not in the world where morals apply ( hint : you 'll have to leave switzerland to experience them ) . 
  if you were really neutral , you 'd not sell arms to any party . 
  neutrality does not mean : `` i wo n't take sides but i 'll sell you arms if you want . '', 
  nah , we should just stop treating them like there 's a `` special '' bond between us . 
  as far as i 'm concerned , they 're not different than moldova or morocco in relation to us . 
   our banking industry only makes 10 % of our gdp so our success is certainly not merely a result of tax evasion like people in the rest of the world likes to pretend it absolutely is . 
  that 's the money you use to pump into your economy in the form of loans to start-ups and such . 
  plenty of sketchy businessmen looking for investments , they 're always welcome in morally corrupt switzerland . 
  there 's nothing extraordinary about switzerland but the will to do business at any cost . 
  that 's what makes your country `` exceptional '' . 
   parasitic country best description i 've heard so far . 
  money laundering , opportunistic and taking advantage of conflicts that protect them too ( the safety of europe is directly linked with the safety of switzerland ) , dirty business ethics , ratifying bilateral agreements and then wanting to renegotiate them out of nowhere , ... lol @ the exceptionalism part . 
  we can all throw our ethnics out of the window on do business like they do . 
   ok with me . 
  pretty sure that is n't `` ok '' with your country , something like that would hurt switzerland tremendously . 
   their politics seem to be 110 % about themselves though . 
  they do n't seem interested in anything that does n't benefit themselves directly and everything seems to be fine , if they can make a profit from it . 
  like , usa could make a fortune by selling arms to russian , north korea or whatever , but they wo n't . 
  they 're taking some sort of moral stance there . 
  switzerland does n't seem to give a shit .

  recently , a local police made an experiment of pedagogy ( a method which consists in explaining to the population why they are breaking the law at the moment ) , asking the concerned women to remove their burkah or to go back home ( since they can wear what they want in their home ) . 
  it went smoothy and they did n't have to arrest anyone . 
  source ( in french , it 's a local event after all ) : http://www.lexpress.fr/actualite/societe/annecy-la-police-distribue-des-tracts-aux-touristes-voilees_1701414.html, 
  a law like this has been voted in france , under sarkozy . 
  he outlawed burkah and anything covering the face . 
  what happened is a [ streisand effect ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/streisand_effect ) . 
  the burkah phenomenon estimated to 367 muslims in france spread to reach 2000 . 
  before jumping instantly to a moral argument and vote the laws anyways , it 's better to ask yourself if it 's worth the cost . 
  it 's a bit caricatural . 
  is n't french the only legitimate latin heir and all other languages slang of it ? 
  seriously , what the fuck is the pkk trying to do ? 
  they are n't going to win and do n't have the support of the whole kurdistan . 
  it 's just adding sufferings and killing political solution in the egg . 
  in the west , there was the marshall plan , and as good as i remember my old history courses the soviets made their own marshall plan in the communist block . 
  claerc is n't french ( at least it 's what he claimed in another comment ) . 
  by the way , you know our feel now , bro . 
  i think we should begin to give bush points ( like godwin points ) everytime someone uses the false surrendering monkey clich\u00e9 . 
  [ here is your first bush point . 
  ] ( http://tofdestar.fr/wp-content/images-stars/george-bush/george-bush_1676_1927343.jpg ), 
  if it 's simple and plausible , then it 's false . 
  this comment is wrong on so many levels . 
  i do n't know where to begin with . 
  france , 1 of the 3 significant european military powers backed obama about an intervention in syria . 
  there is no such deal about those utopia and us being merc of europe . 
  why would france have intervened in mali then ? 
  us and eu share common interests and help each other in their own interests . 
  you do n't believe me ? 
  look closer at the middle east politics . 
  european countries has a long history of supporting arab countries while us , for internal politics reasons , support israel . 
  geopolitics is n't a fairy tale of great ideas . 
  2 years ago , mali was about to fall in djihadists hands , after they had overtaken their separatists allies and beaten the governement . 
  france intervened and kicked them out of mali . 
  there is still a un peace-keeper force there . 
  in ivory coast , after presidential elections , both candidates claimed victory . 
  france militarily helped one of the candidate to kick the former president out of power . 
  overseas territories range from identical to mainland france ( la r\u00e9union ) to nearly independent . 
  there is one independentist movement in new caledonia . 
  there was a fight which made 21 casualities in ouvea in 1989 . 
  there will be a referendum in 2018 to decide if they want to leave france or not . 
  french navy does n't have the means to protect all french seas against illegal fishing and france is n't using them . 
  most of the overseas territories costs more in subsidies than it gives to france ( high unemployment , criminality ) . 
  so it 's not that important for france . 
  the most strategical overseas territory is guiana with [ kourou ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/guiana_space_centre ) . 
  de gaulle made a referendum in algeria in 1962 , which was considered as metropolitan france , to end the algeria 's war . 
  weirdly , they chose independence . 
  it was quite exceptional . 
  he did another important referendum in 1969 after may 68 and the french youth demonstrations . 
  he wanted to know if he still had the confidence of the french people but was n't constitutionally allowed to make a `` plebiscit '' , a french traditional votation to renew the legitimacy of the head of the state . 
  if the answer was `` no '' , he would resign . 
  of course , no one cared about the official content of the referendum , but it was about regional powers . 
  the `` no '' won , and the carreer of the father of modern days france ended . 
  i have just read the constitution , there is nothing like this . 
  and it would be in the constitution without a doubt . 
  a spanish would answer the question better than me . 
  but from what i have found , spanish justice and constitution council declared illegal a previous votation ( catalonia made a mock referendum that spain tried to stop ) and there is nothing about independance in their constitution , so i would say no . 
  meeh , we would send some bulls at them and see if they are that good at corridas . 
  actually , i have never heard anything about roussillon wanting to leave france , so that does n't seem to be quite a thing there . 
  in fact , it 's even in an area which is historically known for its support to the republic and its unity . 
  so pretty meh . 
  that 's exactly the point of my comment . 
  it 's a small group , but with a serious background . 
  http://www.lefigaro.fr/vox/politique/2014/04/22/31001-20140422artfig00175-bonnets-rouges-les-independantismes-menacent-ils-une-europe-en-crise.php the problem is n't what is happening right now , it 's what could happen in 10/20/50 years if independantism spreads . 
  france and spain have in common they do n't want to see an independant catalonia . 
  they just have to commonly decide that catalonia is n't part of schengen since it 's a new state . 
  companies would move to spain . 
  end of the party . 
   ok guys , we are being beaten by a multi-cultural entity using women soldiers and 40 years old weapons , what should we do ? 
   hmmm , let 's attack some civilians in their refugee camps  hurting them , killing them again and sending them to europe , hoping they would support us from the inside , sounds like a great plan !, 
  i know what eastern europe is , i really do n't get the point of your comment . 
  sorry if i do n't want to write `` poland , lithuania , lettonia and estonia '' every time i am talking about a group of countries which share the same military threat . 
  it 's just a way of saying things without being boring . 
  [ litterally me when i saw half of france listed as occitanian separatists ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drhklv2414o ), 
  france would make an example out of catalunya to dissuade briton , corsican and basque independantists to show off . 
  those groups are weak and unlegitimate in the eyes of the local people but gov wants it to stay like this . 
  moreover , you can be sure eastern europe would be against since they already heard too much about a minority wanting to become independant . 
  i just checked the 1951 convention about refugees :  no contracting state shall expel or return ( ` refouler ' ) a refugee in any manner whatsoever to the frontiers of territories where his life or freedom would be threatened on account of his race , religion , nationality , membership of a particular social or political opinion following how `` frontiers '' is interpretated , it can allow or forbid such a move . 
  anyways , it 's doubtful the un refugee agency will be happy with that , and it wo n't solve the problem at all . 
  they came from syria , it wo n't stop all of them to try again . 
  and 3 months after eu would have kicked them , you would have a new refugee crisis . 
  there are two separate problems and bringing a solution to one does n't forbid to bring a solution to the other one . 
  it 's completely obvious that eu has to do something to stop people from leaving syria . 
  but after my facepalm sessions for the libyan post-war period managing by france ( my own country ) and other countries , i have no illusions that they wo n't be able to do anything . 
  but they should . 
  yet we have to solve the situation of refugees that are on the european territory right now . 
  they are completely right , both on legal and on treaties plans . 
  but europe is facing a free-rider dilemna : no one really wants to take care of these refugees , yet we will have to do it . 
  i see only 2 solutions : - the fair one , which is to go over treaties and share the number of refugees , which will upset the visegrad group a lot - the `` chaotical '' one where every country has to deal with their own refugee crisis , trying to use european treaties for their advantage and where european political unity will suffer a lot knowing the strength of the european leadership , i would bet on the second one , and that germany will get most of the refugees . 
  what europe is facing is more complicated than just `` is 100k big ? 
  is 500k big ? '' . 
  first , there is the obvious incoming impact on the european societies , both social and economic . 
  can our societies handle much more poverty and `` desesperate cases '' ? 
  it 's also questioning our welfare politics , since we were very happy with them . 
  they were made to protect eu citizens and help the most tragic situations for the foreigners in europe . 
  but now they are the reason why so many refugees chose europe over an other destination , algeria for example ( which accepts refugees and is a safe country ) . 
  then there is the logistics problem . 
  who is going to deal with the immediate consequences of their presence ? 
  there is the whole legal-bureaucratic mess about who is supposed to do what , from the syrian refugee to the state , through the eu citizen transporting a family through the borders . 
  add to this that a ( presumably small ) part of the migrants do n't have the right to claim asylum in europe because they are coming from safe countries , and you get a huge shitstorm . 
  and then there is the last step , which is the eu cohesion and solidarity is being tested , many countries refusing to take a part of the burden , weakening the political union of europe . 
  of course not  it 's just to compare the scale of the populations involved .

  people of / r/europe , is this what you want for mods ? 
  / u/marktplatz , our dear mod , where are you when your leader needs you ? 
  or maybe you 're too busy letting posts linger in the mod queue when they have the wrong keywords in the title , mmh ? 
  i mean like this one i posted : https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6nrqpy/paris_train_station_overwhelmed_with_migrants/ it 's been 2 hours and you 've had the time to write 11 comments elsewhere . 
  you did n't even reply to my mod-mail message to have it reviewed . 
  it is definitely not the first time you low-noise censor things this way , / u/marktplatz ; and other mods will be my witnesses on this one . 
  this is why i 'm writing the following : -- this comment is my official request to remove you as a mod for / r/europe . 
  on numerous occasions you have used your powers as a mod to subtly apply censorship in / r/europe in order to push your agenda to reduce the debate of over the refugee crisis . 
  electing new mods to / r/europe instead of you will be beneficial , as the post queue will be processed without delay , and without selective censorship . 
  what a catastrophe for europe this woman is . 
  make no mistake , this is only tearing europe apart . 
  i wish our european parliament would grow some balls , and set the limit itself at the european level . 
  freedom of movement means merkel 's behavior affects us all . 
  posting this here because she has almost 300k subscribers , and we will necessarily hear from this from other sources . 
  the thing is : erdogan is a blessing in disguise . 
  with him we see the true colors of turkey . 
  he did not seize power . 
  this fucking clown got elected . 
  and got his referendum too !, 
  the whole of turkey is like that . 
  erdogan or not , turkey has no place in the eu . 
  true . 
  the problem is having the immediate cash , and financing it long term . 
  our politicians have no balls and would rather replace us than deal with it . 
  make your voice known . 
  elect border-closing candidates . 
  maybe you 're right . 
  maybe we should try to boost family programs . 
  immigration is still a completely crappy thing to do , though . 
  it is better to go through population shrinkage than replace the children we did n't want to have . 
  it 's ok , though . 
  we have had population imbalances since the post war baby boom , and we did ok . just like japan , we 'll have to make adjustments . 
  but absolutely nothing to be fearful of . 
  marry me < 3, 
  ~ ~ near ~ ~, 
  on a different rail system as the eu 's . 
  this is the guy we need to test our deportation programs on . 
  why is the process not officially killed is beyond me . 
  every time our politicians talk about it , it is `` paused '' , `` freezed '' , etc. 
  never `` cancelled '' . 
  do they not care about re-\u00e9lection ? 
  * among quite a massive lot of other things . 
  and that 's only 5 % of the reasons . 
  just no . 
  no need to even read the article . 
  thank you austria for calling italy on on its bullshit . 
  since you announced the border closure , they have started to try to control the smugglers/ngos . 
  you let the smugglers/ngos do their business , you keep them . 
  it cost so much to deport : / we need autralia 's immigration policy . 
  i wish people would stop fearing population shrinking . 
  no the economist , we do n't need more migrants . 
  it 's ok shrink down the population if we do n't want to make babies . 
  the only thing we would need is better support for families , but not importing people . 
  also , it 's ok to have population shrinking . 
  no need for migrants either way . 
  that is indeed a big problem to tackle . 
  some heavy compensation has to take place at the very least . 
  but the bigger picture has to be looked at , too . 
  advocates for having turkey in the eu say it would solve the issue . 
  if we solve this the cyprus crisis , then booting turkey definitely from the eu accession process will be a no brainer . 
  i do n't know about you , but the thought of being in the same country as turks is disturbing my sleep . 
  let 's hope this will help cyprus get reunified with no turkish troops on its soil . 
   turkey is `` ahead '' of the eu when it comes to protecting human rights , turkish president recep tayyip erdo\u011fan said [ you do n't say . 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/1hipc5w.gifv ) turkey has no place in the eu . 
  it does n't . 
  france has been doing tremendously before any immigration occurred . 
  it takes the right culture , though . 
   please be logical , not emotional . 
  except for russia , not having a crappy ally like you in nato is logical . 
  that 's alright , and you 're welcome to do this . 
  as long as you can use our native language in good fashion , respect our culture , respect our history and not try to rewrite it . 
  -- why the fuck advocating for having massive amounts of cultural foreigners in , though ? 
  these countries got build over millenias . 
  we got carved by the harsh environment : no house you die of frost , no agriculture you die of hunger . 
  the resulting culture is the pinnacle of civilization . 
  why the fuck dilute us heavily ? 
  i get what you mean ; this is simply racism . 
  white people have bend over backwards in accommodating minorities so much i do n't think there is racism towards them anymore . 
  this is just plain racism . 
  and yet you choose to display the flag of another country . 
  you 're the assimilation problem we 're having . 
  what a fucking joke our immigration policy is . 
  you 're the trojan horse , and you 're not even hiding it . 
   you know eu = / = nato right ? 
  i do . 
  i was saying that as well as getting booted from ever accessing the eu , turkey should get booted from nato . 
  --  basically created against russia yep . 
  and make no mistake : that 's the only reason you 're in nato . 
  i wish we could cool things down with russia . 
  it 'd make way more sense for everybody . 
   deny cultural european achievements so , discrimination . 
  and directed towards the other way ? 
  reverse discrimination , if you prefer . 
  your source does n't say that . 
  it says :  10.6 percent of london 's population of 7,556,900 were black . 
   of the recorded 18,091 such accusations against males , 54 percent accused of street crimes were black ; for robbery , 59 percent ; and for gun crimes , 67 percent . 
  no mentions of islam , everything is under the `` asian '' category . 
  -- you 're only quoting one line , and failing to say that black and asian are disproportionately represented in crime , in proportion of their numbers . 
   you 're whole problem * your whole problem  you 're approach * your approach -- oh they can try to better themselves . 
  but it is not a matter of compatibility of institutions .

  there were popes and antipopes fighting . 
  it really was n't that united . 
  the pope was powerless most of the time . 
  sometimes it looked like a simple multinational ngo which happened to collect taxes . 
  thanks !, 
  western poland is polish now thanks to the people living there now . 
  the fact that we got here through an annexation does n't make the current polish claim any less legitimate . 
  so stop appealing to history or excusing warcrimes . 
  you can recognize that bad things happened in the past and recognize that we ca n't do anything about it anymore . 
  even czechia begins to admit that they went too far during the expulsion of germans . 
  war crimes are not an excuse for war crimes . 
  just because the coercion was n't done by the poles does n't mean there was no coercion . 
  are you triggered because `` polish annexation '' seems to imply polish responsibility ? 
  because apart from that , you have to admit there was coercion on germany and benefits for poland . 
  there was pretty much all the characteristic of an annexation except poland was already a satellite state in the making . 
  yes , yes , yes . 
  no people were sovereign in the middle ages . 
  what a king owned in the 10th century is not a rightful claim for any nation in the world . 
  so what a king stole from another king is irrelevant to decide what nations actually own . 
  sure they are not of the same level of importance of the rest . 
  but it ca n't be fought effectively without global cooperation . 
  and it would be an easy step to make in the fight against growing inequalities . 
  inequalities seem to be one of the most important challenge of this century . 
  you will have to explain to me where is the lack of democracy then . 
  because the usual criticism are unelected officials ( they are appointed by national governments to preserve national legitimacy ) and the fact that half of wallonia can paralyse the entire eu political process . 
  i do n't see how you democratize this without withdrawing these two privileges . 
  hey !, 
  with brexit they might go ... to germany . 
  it 's usually shitty conditions with confiscation of the passport . 
  it 's enough to be considered human-trafficking in europe . 
  but some people do n't hold saudi arabia to the same standard . 
  half the active population of saudi arabia is foreigners basically reduced to slavery . 
  and there is the shia community on the gulf coast who suffers daily persecution . 
  six millions slaves is a little bit more than ` soft ' human right abuse in my opinion even though it may not compare to 100,000 deaths in kurdistan . 
  ps : the genocide had ended about 20 years earlier . 
  it 's not like there was an imminent threat . 
  obviously i 'm biased but i 'm not aware of terrible corruption in the eu . 
  i feel like the eu on the contrary has stood up against big companies like monsanto and google where national governments tended to comply . 
  when we want to , we can eradicated some of the deadliest disease in the world or build the iss . 
  but i 'm not naive , i know most of this is impossible and it is not the eu 's * fault . 
  but europe did n't share an history ? 
  we shared the same royal families for centuries . 
  we 've read the same religious books and philosophers . 
  now with a double layer of light americanization and erasmus , europeans share more than ever before . 
  sure it 's not enough to make us part of one ethnicity or even one nationality . 
  but i 'm not sure i understand what cultural difference is sufficiently big between us to justify the impossibility to share a federal governement with limited competence . 
  edit : format, 
  if the swiss can do it , we can too . 
  i think a federalist union is totally able to put the emphasis on regionalism . 
  ( and that would be pretty much the only way because everyone cherish our diversity in europe ) . 
  federalisation is way to get rid of the european council which is the least democratic entity in the eu . 
  but usually anti-federalists have this weird cognitive dissonance where they want both more democracy and more state 's right at the same time . 
  i disagree . 
  we ca n't make meaningful environmental policy without a global entity . 
  so far each protocole has been extremely difficult to ratify . 
  but even better , global cooperation on food , health , security , development aid and the fight against fiscal paradises seem very valuable to me regardless of an alien contact . 
  in my opinion , as long as there are no global cooperation , there will be wealthy countries exploiting poor countries , and there will be small countries cheating to steal the money from the big . 
  but global cooperation is impossible as long as we do n't all agree on some global principles like democracy imo . 
  there 's quite the difference between defensive and offensive war . 
  there 's also a diffference between guerilla and conventional warfare . 
  for the defence of a member country , there would n't be the political division we have seen in libya . 
  and contrary to the balkans , war against russia hopefully would n't be a nasty ethnic cleansing guerilla ( i think nato was actually pretty succesful considering the difficulty of the situation . 
  but you can only do that much when civilians are targets ) . 
  i would like that at the condition that all the member countries share european values of democracy and welfare state . 
  so far , this limits our federation to most of europe . 
  the actual problem in my opinion is exactly that we are n't even federal yet . 
  we barely are confederate . 
  any state can veto any decision taken by the eu . 
  when your only land border has been one of the bloodiest of the last half-century until it was taken down , this is a little bit ironic . 
  it can be argued that we already shared sovereignty before the eu . 
  every currencies were following either the dollar , the deutsche mark or the pound for years . 
  foreign policy was just obedience to the us or the ussr . 
  early environmental policies were small inconsequential national measures while every neighbour had to endure each other 's pollution . 
  there is no such thing as complete sovereignty ( even north korea is d\u00e9pendent on food aid ) . 
  by further integrating the eu , smaller entities have a proportional say instead of a diktat to follow . 
  but i can see that some compromise can work too . 
  norway gave up many of its sovereignty to the eu without a voice in the european parliament ( here it really is `` giving up '' instead of `` sharing '' ) . 
  but they retain full sovereignty in the few areas that matter the most to them . 
  dictators are mortal . 
  by design most dictatorships are not long-lived . 
  that sucks but i do n't think we could have done much better than just wait it out . 
  unless by some miracle the balance between the opposition and saddam hussein had tilted . 
  it is one of those situation where there appears to be no good solutions like modern-days syria . 
  ok my point is not actually we should invade every human right abusers . 
  it 's quite the opposite . 
  i do n't think we should have invaded iraq . 
  unless you argue that saddam hussein was far worse than saudi arabia , which it never appeared to be for me . 
  his regime was as stable as the monarchy and the wide-spread human rights abuses had been kept out of sight for decades . 
  and just to prove my point , democracy failed to succeed to saddam hussein . 
  outrage is n't really productive . 
  being angry at a totalitarian regime without any plan may be laying the ground for the next one . 
  isis is probably worse than saddam ever were . 
  sometimes we have to be pragmatic . 
  one simple principle imo is to intervene only after the local population has shown support for foreign intervention for example . 
  that does n't solve everything but i think it would have helped . 
  i 'm not a saddam apologist . 
  sure he was a terrible man and i 'm glad he 's gone . 
  but when at the same time , khadaffi was camping in trump 's garden or that the king of saudi arabia was shaking hands with bush and then obama . 
  when you do n't intervene to defend actual democratic rebellions in iran or the car . 
  when you are complacent about the absolute worst regime in the world in north korea .

lol even still ... i expect that the top 4-5 teams at least did not fire managers halfway through ... that is like 15 teams 23 manager changes,

  okay italy you win this round, 
  everything i read or watched in the past week said 120 battements or faute d'amour ( the russian one ) would win ... so yeah that was surprising ... in other news : * ramadan started * our president went to mali / g7 / nato * roland-garros started * psg won the cup of france,

  all of it ... 
  thoughts : * hosts were horrible * jury voting is outdated ( australia 171 seriously ?? 
  also of course sweden gets all nordic votes ) * spain was ... just i do n't even know ... who voted for them * rip iba * france / italy / hungary should have been higher * congratulations salvador ... fuck your speech, 
  so did you guys < 3, 
  it 's ukraine probably seen that before, 
  #fuck the juries you guys were trash, 
  hungary, 
  which ghetto did they find timur in smh, 
  static weepy bitch is here, 
  ukrainians : are there not three english speakers in your country who could host ? 
  yup looks like russia can participate next year then, 
  hello scary giant head, 
  i love the song !, 
  italy / portugal / bulgaria - favourites, 
  eugh i hate it ... just another ballad, 
  yes , very . 
  financial troubles, 
  can you guys somehow win so petra can re-host, 
  apparently, 
  yeah but both lose the last syllable so it still should rhyme, 
  i pronounce it similar to that, 
  nf not eurovision ... still a pretty impressive number, 
  and then we would have spain at # 26, 
  it 's about love being born and dying and centuries passing and disappearing ... basically love, 
  chorus is romani ? 
  ~ ~ rise like a phoenix / fairytale ~ ~ #lovelovepeacepeace, 
  okay i know france  italy etc etc but if francesco does n't win ... 
  rip, 
  probably, 
  i 'm not very religious, 
  on behalf of all muslims , i apologise for such crazy fucks, 
  i think even the luxembourgeois have forgotten luxembourgish, 
  well it 's the only one largely spoken here ... was n't trying to be factual or anything edit : grammar, 
  wow german is weird, 
  so why are deutsch and english capitalised but not most others ? 
  it 's very fashionable, 
  thankfully that ended ... imagine breton being the official language of france, 
  so austria was celtic ? 
  wow i never knew, 
  probably the same people who think all muslims are daech, 
  did n't think i 'd need the / s but yeah was totally joking,

  i 've supported macron since probably before he supported himself but le pen ( and her supporters ) are much better than anyone or anything you find on that subreddit, 
  9 votes for marine vs 2 for macron in ouanary ( 81,82 % ) source - https://www.lefigaro.fr/elections/resultats/guyane-973/ouanary-97314/, 
  macron winning by over 15 % departments that marine won the first round, 
  wow ... no words, 
  did n't trump release a video of him speaking hindi ? 
  also the newborn in the saudi royal family was named ivanka, 
  probably ... i think it 's as weird as you do, 
  macron is speaking .

  it sounds more like jealousy because you ended up in the communist block instead of the west . 
  german word order . 
  i do n't get it , how do you run after people and pester them unintentionally ? 
  is that a mistranslation or something ? 
  yeah i do n't even get why so many people are surprised in this thread . 
  i know it 's / r/europe where everybody hates muslims but i do n't find the results of the study very surprising . 
  i do n't know much about german muslims , but most muslims you meet in france are from algeria/tunisia/morocco , and in my experience , tons of them do n't do the ramadan , drink alcohol , do n't wear the veil etc. . . 
  they are n't hardcore muslims at all . 
  `` muslim '' does n't mean much , your average tunisian is very different from your average saudi . 
  did you really create a new account just to post this ? 
  ridiculous . 
  i 've been saying that dclauzel doing that was annoying and cringeworthy for a very long time and people generally agree . 
  [ is this comment from today , for instance ? 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2sfcq8/weve_got_some_nice_climate_diversity_in_the_eu/cnp78s6 ), 
  they had to pick the only french dude who does it as the french mod for / r/europe ... 
  bah , lots of people would be willing to help . 
  can we dispose of mods for the cringeworthy two-language comments ? 
  seriously that 's the only reason why i ca n't stand that mod . 
  ca n't he just speak english like everybody else on / r/europe ? 
  these two-language comments look so smug and are bad publicity for the french . 
  we 're not all like that i promise . 
  strangely enough , i trust [ the united nations ' predictions ] ( http://passeurdesciences.blog.lemonde.fr/2014/09/21/lexplosion-demographique-ne-sarretera-pas-au-cours-de-ce-siecle/ ) more than reddit user tangojager 's . 
  the fact that `` pissed '' means `` drunk '' and not `` pissed off '' really confused me when i first lived in the uk . 
  there will be 4 billions africans by 2100 . 
  it 's becoming necessary . 
   300 euro ** per person ** so , if there are three people on average per household , it 's 900 euros ? 
  and 27 % of 900 euros is 243 euro ? 
  since it 's the 80 % poorest household the result should be higher so 315 euro makes perfect sense ? 
  that counts !, 
   you pretty much require to be born into a sufficiently catholic family to get named after a saint and for your parents to care about saints and their respective name days . 
  i disagree . 
  in practice , people just look for a name that is vaguely linked to theirs on the calendar . 
  also , while it was traditionally a religious thing , nobody cares about the religious part of it nowadays , like for christmas . 
  well , we know it 's a thing at least . 
  if i ask you when your f\u00eate is , you 'll know what i 'm talking about . 
  interestingly , if you talk with someone from qu\u00e9bec and ask when their f\u00eate is , they 'll think it means birthday , and will have no clue what a name day is , even though they 're traditionally catholic . 
  i 'm a guy and people wish it to me too . 
  i resent what you guys are saying about the french in this thread and i hereby complain . 
  please paypal me 100 euros . 
  in english vowels so n't seem to matter much , a lot of them are just schwas , while where you put the tonic stress is crucial to understand words . 
  it makes parsing french and english completely different , and even though i feel very comfortable reading and writing english , it 's still hard for me to understand native speakers even after having lived in an english-speaking country for a long time . 
  haha , i was thinking the same things . 
  spaniards must be the only ones who like hollande . 
  cities have different names in different languages , get over it . 
  if i talk about marseille in french i 'll say marseille , if i talk about marseille in english i 'll add a final 's ' . 
  that 's just how it works . 
  do you also talk about `` deutschland '' in english instead of germany because it 's the german name of a german country ? 
  i suspect your media has a huge bias because this is n't my experience at all when i was in the region . 
  also where i 'm from ( south east , french riviera ) , we have the double signs but it 's more for tourists , i 've never met anyone who could speak occitan in my life . 
  that really does n't mean anything at all . 
  i 'm not a parisian , no , and i doubt you are from french pays basque . 
  i like how it 's always foreigners who wish that for france , as if they thought deciding for us something that is against what we want is a good thing . 
  heh , exactly what i thought when i saw this post . 
  the 50 francs bills were so cool ... 
  i disagree . 
  do you really think if you polled the american population and asked if there should be a full-blown war with russia over a country like lithuania the majority of the people would say yes ? 
  tbh it 's the opinion of the * population * ... not what the government will do . 
  well , is n't dutch just german spoken with a weird accent ? 
  that 's really strange , i think coffee in paris is awful . 
  and yes it 's really strange how in the us/canada/australia people seem to associate france with coffee , because i really do n't think we think our coffee is good or that we are famous for that ? 
  to us , coffee = italy . 
  usually coffee in portugal is pretty good too in my experience though . 
  we actually rarely ever eat that . 
  i ate snails once in my life , and it was in spain . 
  italian coffee . 
  seriously , you go to the shittiest bar in the middle of nowhere in italy and they always serve you a perfect espresso . 
  why ca n't we have this ? 
  bleh , i usually get my kebabs in a pita , not in bread . 
  it 's better . 
  and pita is closer to a tortilla than whatever you have on this pic . 
  he acts like he is the figurehead of france 's involvement in the lybian war . 
  complete weirdo . 
  tbh i sort of understand why putin does n't want him . 
  i would n't be surprised if he went there and acted like he is some sort of martyr going to mordor to bring human rights from the french revolution or some shit . 
  bhl and cohn-bendit seriously ? 
  that 's so random . 
  why would anyone care if they ca n't go to russia ? 
  pretty sure they do n't care themselves . 
  that 's not really true . 
  i usually spend a very long time on flight price comparators to find the cheapest possible tickets and it 's happened pretty often that the cheapest flights between vancouver and france ( the route i use the most ) are from klm . 
  it probably depends on the route . 
  last time air france tried to reform , their pilots went on strike for a month causing millions in losses ... 
  entitled assholes . 
  i 'm confused as to how you can think they were n't . 
  what do you think they were when they were small ? 
  you seem to like people riding things . 
  per capita makes no sense for this . 
  quite . 
  why ? 
  the bigger countries tend to do whatever the fuck they want while smaller ones have to be obedient . 
  i think it makes sense . 
  but what do you do with them ? 
  if you ca n't prove their nationality , you ca n't send them back , their home country wo n't accept them . 
  that 's basically the whole problem here , if italy could send back the migrants , they would . 
  you completely missed my point . 
  what i mean is , other people from the same countries are just as desperate . 
  is it fair to only accept the ones who attempted to cross the sea ? 
  where do you stop ? 
  and then people at the border control there put them back into a plane for your country ? 
   well first indication of the persons origin it 's a passport.if they do n't have one then name , language they speak , appearance , religion.combine all of these and you have a pretty good estimation of their country of origin .

  isis in stolen turkish police uniforms prevented ambulances from reaching the site and tried to kill systematically survivors . 
  that does n't exactly look well . 
  pkk still do n't really answer . 
  yps ( turkish hotheads ) disobey order and kills 2 cops in their rage . 
  pkk take the blame for them for internal reasons . 
  turkey immediately do like 100 air strikes on qandil in 3 days , and keep at a similar rate the bombings for weeks . 
  - bombing attack in ankara , press says by isis . 
  for a moment i thought 200 kg of tnt borrowed beneath the concrete of the freshly rebuilt road exploded just on demirtas which incidently happen to be the leader of the pro kurd opposition ; but maybe i 'm wrong since he somehow survived it even if a bit traumatized - random shelling keep happening on kurdish position from a northern direction . 
  - rumors pretend daesh injured soldiers in syria are picked up by turkish patrols , brought in turkish hospitals , rearmed and sent back in syria . 
  but fine let 's admit it never happened either . 
  - june 2015 . 
  kobane is weeeeeellll within kurdish territory on all sides , nothing visible in the desert for miles around . 
  suddenly hundreds of daeshis from suicide squads appear north of the town without warning . 
  turkish cameras all suddenly malfunction in the border crossing . 
  another multi tons svbid the size of a truck appear out of nowhere north of town and take an entire city block along . 
  hundreds of civilians dies . 
  turkish press is nearly cheering . 
  - turkish army presence explode in southern turkey , rumors they shoot civilians . 
  yps snaps , and start shooting back . 
  pkk still holding back 90 % of it 's forces . 
  - more random shelling from the northern side of the border on kurdish positions , especially in tel abyad - daesh is beaten back south of tel abyad , and near sarrin , then attempt another massacre in hasakah but is finally driven back . 
  - turkish military `` accidentally cross '' in rojava multiple times to `` securise the building of the border wall '' . 
  they must have used the same kind of gps russians used in ukraine i guess . 
  still no answer . 
  - fsa get hijacked again idlib/aleppo by nusra/arhar islamists . 
  - more `` accidental crossings '' of * hundreds * of turkish soldiers near qamishlo , pretty obviously hopping to draw fire in to play `` victims of the evil pkk '' . 
  - did i told you about the random shelling already that still happen ? 
  - the islamists in northern syria get more hardcore , start randomly shelling sheik maksoud & then afrin . 
  coincidentally around times of suspected ammo delivery from unknown foreign sponsors . 
  - we westerners got fuckin tired with the islamists , withdrawal of support for a big part of the fsa . 
  russians intensify their air campaign . 
  the tiger forces link up with kwereis surrounded by isis - turkey blows up a russian plane - daesh keep using tishreen and west euphrates as a staging ground to harass ypg with ridiculous amounts of ammunition somehow smuggled by jarabulus - the islamists are getting spanked by saa+r ussians - more gratuitous death threats for turkey to the kurds in syria that still never even touched them . 
  - turkish-backed islamists shell some more afrin . 
  russia meanwhile offer generously support , and even do their best to avoid antagonizing the us !, 
  that 's starting to pill up . 
  and the ypg still has n't touched an hair of turkey . 
  seriously , what was turkey expecting there ? 
  that the kurds would bend backward for them in syria & commit suicide ? 
  i think them being neutral most of the time and loosely friendly toward the russians/saa was kind of inevitable at that point, 
   and a moat with sharks and lasers . 
  right ? 
  well you know since i saw a certain middle east country using assault dolphin ( the animal , not sub class ) with specially designed underwater guns/pneumatic harpoons ... 
  that article is less actually about the migrant crisis and more an excuse to blame everything happening in macedonia on absolutely everyone else but them . 
  but `` hey look secret-world-domination-greekogermany-plot - ! '', 
  haha ( / s ) . 
  seriously . 
  \\ - picking some soundbites out of it :  since january 2015 , macedonia has survived an unprecedented combination of security threats ; these include an ongoing political crisis sparked by an attempted coup , a narrowly-averted terrorist plot ( a threat which credible intelligence indicates may return ) lol , was n't that a balkan ( or even possibly false flag ? ), 
  internal political thing ? 
  https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/35doyd/fighting_between_police_and_unidentified_armed/ but nice demagogy to attach that back on the migrant crisis . 
   as new information below reveals , germany and greece are in a secret alliance ho boy . 
  secret `` germany/greek alliance '' xd right . 
  seems legit . 
  i 'm surprized they did n't yet ranted about the `` secret usa/russia new world domination order '' , the `` secret turkish/pkk alliance for syria '' and `` how the usa are totally funding isis '' . 
   they are opposed by the visegrad countries , which constitute the core of a second and rival european alliance . 
  and , apart for hungaria , received little to zero migrants . 
  :|  this is what the germans , eu and unhcr failed to understand when thinking they could bribe the country 's leaders into accepting 30,000 refugees in camps . 
  ah yes dear strong leader is showing them the evil corrupt eu . 
  * facepalm * they got asked to take 30k which is like 0.1 % of the situation because well tossing the entire problem on germany is kind of short sighted . 
  but yeah yeah sure the evil eu nazis . 
   another psychological factor that must be considered is the fact that for the last 25 years , macedonians have been continually blockaded , vetoed , lied to and betrayed by foreign ` allies ' and neighbors yeah yeah poor poor totally-not-corrupt-and-rotten-to-the-core macedonia oppressed and surrounded by evil ~ ~ nato ~ ~ eu i mean that just wants to steal all their moneyz and land or something ...  they do not have any reason to trust anyone , and thus they do not . 
  seriously that part of the article would n't be out of place on sputniknews with a remplacement of `` macedonia '' with `` russia '' . 
   being thus the most powerful man in europe for the foreseeable future , erdo\u011fan i 'm sorry wat :d no disrespect intended to mr erdogan who do have some actual influence ; but i do n't think the writer is quite living in the same reality as all of us . 
   ludicrous warning that greece `` might not support '' macedonian euro-atlantic integration it 's the accusation against greece imaginary warning that 's ludicrous . 
  the reason macedonia is not going anywhere yet is because macedonia somehow managed to be even more corrupt than greece & ukraine put on top of each other . 
  and that 's quite a feat . 
  but i guess macedonian press ca n't exactly write that one down [ what with having absolutely no press freedom and all ] ( http://www.rferl.org/content/macedonia-last-press-freedom-report/26985345.html ) . 
  they even still arrest journalists under various excuses when they talk bad about the gov ( or justice system ) : http://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2013/oct/22/press-freedom-macedonia  finally , there is always the chance -- especially during summer -- of exploding grenades and shells left over from the first world war . 
  ( these collector 's items are primarily found in the mariovo mountain area , where people still go in search of similarly buried french army cognac and gold from that period ) . 
  i thought you wanted to scare people away . 
  not to tell them where to dig stuff to sell it on ebay haha  wildlife : wild animals such as bears , wolves and wild boar all inhabit macedonia 's southern mountains . 
  the country 's snake population includes three poisonous viper species . 
  especially in aqueous areas , snake populations generally increase in springtime . 
  that much is true tho . 
  lots of goddam boars in the area . 
  do n't get yourself gored  so it 's reassuring to know that some 3,300 booby traps i can tell you right now it 's going to kill more macedonians than immigrants . 
  that 's what landmines generally do . 
  assasinating peoples in numbers for trespassing also violate quite a number of agreement and legislations so if you want to get in the eu it 's not exactly the idea of the century either . 
   there 's really no easy way out of this , we will need international cooperation on a level i do not see happening any time soon well the westerners will kindah keep an eye on the north of the country and maybe , maybe rebel areas depending on how things goes . 
  but the rest of the country i do n't think we 'd be very welcome anyway . 
  so if somebody sticks in damascus , latakia or der ezzor for example , it 's likely going to be russians or iranians, 
  ( i kindah start to understand when the pols complained they got called nazis haha ), 
   the syrians do n't want a permanent foreign occupation well if the russians wants to occupy ( or at least manage ) it long term that 'd solve it and both are friendly with each others . 
   the `` right to be forgotten '' is one of the most fucked-up , oppressive , orwellian things to ever come out of brussels . 
  i disagree . 
  and in 10 years if it was n't there you 'd say everything is exposed and we 're in 1984 open surveillance of each others . 
   the problem is , when the proposal is up and the negotiations are finished , it 'll be a take it or leave it situation . 
  it 's final . 
  something i agree with you there . 
  i think there should a couple times where they release the * current * negociated status to check reactions from various eu parties . 
  maybe not doing it constantly ( too much work ) but at least once or two before reaching final agreement would be nice ; to see if any specific country or party has something that would cause them a major problem in it they were n't made aware of by negociation channels . 
  a bit more transparency from times to times might be decent . 
  that might even allow to iron out better kinks and get more people onboard to vote it in the end ( but you know without isds and corporate-led courts self awarding themselves money ) . 
  altho to be fair , it is true germany needs a solid financial back to handle the migrant crisis like they did . 
  clever on their part , but they rise a valid point nontheless . 
  plus it is their country on that one so if that create some negative economic consequences in germany , they are likely aware of it . 
  if they want to bail it out , i suspect we are just going to shrug our shoulders and move along . 
  and if there 's a social crisis ( inb4 people argumenting it 's a case of right wing pro-bank economics impoverishing everyone ) we 'll study other ways to address it ( they did a serious realistic step toward that a couple years ago by introducing minimal wage ) . 
  and , uh , ~ ~ if you want to make economic bank vault looting in germany on a regular basis you need the bank to stay in business and have lots of money ~ ~ since most of the cash to address various eu crises comes both from france and germany , we want them to stay strong ( because ca n't get money from them if they do n't have any left ) . 
  so , for once , let 's support germany in how they decide to handle that issue . 
  more realistically , there are a number of concession like easy visas , money ~ ~ and erh well got to think of something else to toss on top erh ~ ~ .

  again , his site went down for 9 minutes . 
  if not for this article i would n't have even known about it and i 'm 100 % certain you would n't have heard about it either . 
  if someone hacks they email accounts and publishes their private stuff , that 'll be a different story . 
  up until now, 
  you did read it wrong because you did n't bother to follow the actual thread . 
  but i guess that 's too much to ask for in this day and age . 
   brittany that 's brittany , ** france ** to you !, 
  so the fact that macron 's website was down for 9 mins means austria will get annexed ? 
  well you 're not melodramatic at all , are you ? 
   but ready to sanction russia over some vague claims without investigation ? 
  more like sanction russia over something that has had no actual impact on french society . 
  i had no idea macron 's website was down for 9 mins and it did n't even matter . 
  but not for starting wars in europe . 
  wtf ? 
   but if its covered in most of europe , why not get a job abroad or apply for some school/uni/etc . 
  students also get healthcare . 
  thanks , learnt a bit . 
   just like the french are willing to compromise on the common agricultural policy puts food on the table does n't it ? 
   the french seat in the un security council for what ? 
  what 's on offer ? 
   the force de frappe give up nukes for what reason ? 
  you make no sense whatsoever . 
  it 's like me asking why is n't germany giving up its car industry ... why ? 
  give up stuff just for the sake of giving up ? 
   nor uk 's qe carriers have catapults which are necessary for regular carrier based planes like the rafale or the f-35c . 
  huh . 
  til.with such a big carrier , i would have thought a catapult is a given . 
  the cdg 's catapult depends on us parts ( which they did restrict back in the 00s during the iraq crisis because ) so i 'd imagine the uk would also get ones . 
  and how much are you willing to pay for that ? 
  we can find good reasons for anything ... but the question is : is it worth it ? 
  considering that the vast amounts of planes nowadays are regular ... the answer seems to be ... nope , not really . 
   some countries like italy or the uk have simply no other option than the f-35b , as they have aircraft carriers which are only capable of launching stovl airplanes . 
  ever since the brits sold their remaining harriers to the usmc , there is no other plane in europe that can take off from extremely short runways or land vertically . 
  the dutch have about 0 aircraft carriers , why would they need 85 vtol planes ? 
  uk 's [ queen elisabeth ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/queen_elizabeth-class_aircraft_carrier ) carriers will be quite large so they accomodate for regular planes . 
  it 's only italy that has no other option ... but 131 seems a bit excessive . 
   and let 's not forget the history of france wanting to put shackles on the bundesbank for pretty much the entirety of the post-war decades . 
   ) so that 's what a german le pen voter sounds like ? 
  next you start bitching about versailles . 
   a common currency demands compromises which the german society has never been willing to make and which other societies are also not willing to make . 
  the germans need to start learning compromises if they wan na live on a continent with other large powers , 
   and maastricht was a post-fact negotiation ... it was about the how , not the what because that had been the issue between mitterand and kohl back in 1990 . 
  it 's so cute seeing you reaching so hard . 
  trying to play facts to fit your narrative . 
   https://euobserver.com/political/119735 and ? 
  mitterrand knew also very well how to go against the will of the people ... when he decided that the death penalty needed to be abolished . 
  such things happen if you wan na be on the right side of history . 
   rafael how about the michelangelo ? 
   the eu should buy the best the eu should buy a plane that fits its specific needs based on the different constraints . 
  considering that the eu has about 4 aircraft carriers , a vtol capable plane is a bit useless . 
   also , airbus does n't make fighters . 
  airbus owns 46 % of the consortium that makes the eurofighter ( the largest shareholder ) . 
  great analysis of the situation man . 
  yes we know that germany is the reluctant partner to the european project . 
  it 's hardly a surprise . 
   so yes , the euro was forced upon the supremely unwilling german society . 
  oh god , stop with the fake history dude . 
  maastricht happened in 92 when the german unification was already done . 
  they could have very well asked for a referendum ... no one forced anyone else . 
   kohl and everyone else in germany perceived mitterand 's machinations exactly as they were meant - as a political blackmail . 
  stop circlejerking about how eeevil france was . 
  mitterrand had a very keen sense on being on the right side of history . 
  http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/the-price-of-unity-was-the-deutsche-mark-sacrificed-for-reunification-a-719940-4.html https://www.quora.com/was-germany-forced-to-adopt-the-euro-as-the-price-for-its-unification it was created in order to further integrate germany into the european union ... the war was only ended 45 years before and all the major political figures had lived through it . 
  but claiming that germany was forced into a monetary union like / u/xnicolex claims is extremely poor history . 
  ( though not uncommon since / r/europe tends to treat history more like a caf\u00e9 conversation ) . 
   germany is n't the one who proposed the euro . 
  in-fact germany was forced into accepting the euro as a price for re-unification that 's some next level bullshit . 
  mitterrand had no power to stop any unification . 
   and want to change this . 
  they want to show how much people stand behind the idea of a united europe . 
  i heard that if they propose political projects and if those political projects get a vote , then they might actually get change done . 
  or they can try pointless marches ... 
   the national assembly can reject the prime minister the president appoints and the president can dissolve the national assembly and have snap elections . 
   if they are for profits really made in this jurisdiction . 
  how would one even impose such a thing ? 
  also capital can flow freely inside the eu . 
   i still do n't see the connection you are trying to make . 
  that bucharest and major cities are by far and large the main parts of the country that profit from the economic boost while smaller towns and rural areas are forgotten . 
  the people are amazed that psd makes 45 % . 
   most likely related to the fact that half the country lives in rural areas , where some even still use wells . 
  here 's germany https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/water_supply_and_sanitation_in_germany#access_to_water_and_sanitation 12 % of the population is rural . 
  close to 100 % have access to running water . 
   he criticised the `` historical amnesia '' of some european leaders . 
  it 's also a bit of this :  it is difficult to get a man to understand something , when his salary depends upon his not understanding it !, 
  well let 's hope that with brexit some preconcevied notions will be challenged and that the lessons will be learnt . 
  while of course exit from the eu is not a solution for any eu country , some improvements need to be made . 
  no no . 
  he 'd rather have others around him stay poor because many are indeed benefiting from the economic progress romania is going though . 
  bucharest has a higher [ gdp per capita than madrid ] ( http://www.romania-insider.com/bucharest-surpasses-madrid-berlin-for-gdp-per-capita/ ) . sure sure that does n't mean that the standard of living is higher than in madrid ... but when you compare it with the fact that 38 % of romanians do n't have access to running water , you can start seeing the deep inequalities . 
   respecting them means acknowledging them as legitimate . 
  you acknowledge them as legitimate the moment you sit down with them at the friggin table . 
   human rights and human decency be damn .

  the elections are two months away . 
  already 62 % of people are * quite interested * or * very interested * at this early stage . 
  turnout was about 80 % last time , so we should expect another 18 % or so to become interested during the next two months . 
  frankly , many people have more to do with their time than obsess over politics a full two months before a vote . 
   edit . 
  what is even more disturbing is that 38 % of the french are `` little to not at all interested '' in the elections ... ... ... 
  it is still months away, 
  if i use racist language and gestures , that makes me a racist , pretty much by definition .

   is life in france truly better than life in switzerland or norway or canada ?

  there is n't some `` car-nationalism '' going on , french car manufacturers are well implanted in their home market , they are everywhere in france since car are manufactured ( renault and peugeot are some of the oldest car manufacturer in the world ) , they saturate the market and they know what french people want , i do n't see why it 's a shocking news . 
  japanese cars do n't really have a bad reputation here , [ especially toyota given that the yaris is built locally .

  yeah the history of franks is linked with what is now france , belgium , germany . 
  clovis was the first to unite the franks and his reign is considered a starting point of what is now france and french people .

  maybe vercingetorix , born in 82 bc . 
  he united the gauls and fought against julius caesar . 
  or clovis , born in 466 and first king of the frank . 
  the loss of algeria was a big hit on the french republic ( big enough to write a new constitution during the war ) .

  edit : i was intensly googling how those drill happen in france but i think it mays ring a bell , and i do n't really want to be monitored . 
  so you 're on your own if you want some example , 
  same for me , i also had a chemical spill drill since i was near a seveso classified plant .

  then it middle school there is a bit more french than basque , but it 's still a billingual teaching . 
   are there any media in those languages ? 
  yes , although they 're obviously local media , but there are plenty . 
  tv channel euskal telebista has an office in bayonne and broadcast in the spanish and french part of the basque country . 
  there is even france 3 euskal herri , which is a local antenna of the state-owned france t\u00e9l\u00e9visions , that has programs in basque ( again , with public money ) . 
  they also have it in alsace , britanny and corsica in the respective local languages . 
  and there are dozens of radios , hundreds of websites across the country in regional languages . 
  i should add that most of them get public subsidies , like the rest of the media do in the country . 
  again , i 'm not saying this is a perfect world for regional languages . 
  there are plenty or problems and i think there is plently to do to protect them . 
  but in this sub , it seems than whenever the topic comes up , people rush to explain that french people hate regional languages and basically attack whoever practice them . 
  in classrooms in britanny 70 years ago ? 
  oh yes , and that is i believe a shameful part of the history of my country . 
  but now , it 's quite ludicrous to claim there is an oppression of people practising their regional language . 
  just to be clear i 'm not talking about you , we 're debatting and it 's always interesting to discuss this kind of matter , but the `` let-me-tell-you-about-your-country '' attitude i saw in some threads on this topic can be quite irritating sometimes . 
  yes , some anonymous people on reddit . 
  in person , i doubt you 'll encounter many . 
  go the r/france and talk to people there , no one will tell you `` occitan does n't exist '' or that regional languages/dialects should be forbidden . 
  as i said , i was born and raised in paris , and i 've never seen any . 
  i do n't deny what successive governments did especially in the 19th century and the first half of the 20th century , they definitely tried to `` kill '' all these languages to impose french as the unique language of the country . 
  but again , you 'll have a hard time finding people who are upset because names of town are written both in basque and french , or breton and french , or that 2 corsicans are speaking their language in ajaccio . 
  and to take again the example of occitan , [ here is the link to the bachelor degree program . 
  ] ( http://www.univ-montp3.fr/occitan/ ) for information , it 's not a private school , but a public university , who is financed by public funds . 
  it 's an odd thing that we apparently all want to destroy these languages but have programs to learn it with public money , is n't it ? 
  i 'm french and i 've never met anyone who has anything against regional languages , quite the opposite actually . 
  i 'm from paris and a good friend of mine is from aix-en-provence in the south east , he has a bachelor degree in occitan and everytime he mentions it , people find it `` so cool '' and `` so interesting '' . 
  do n't mistake some decision-makers in national institutions who do n't go out of paris with french people . 
  hello master-troll , i bow before you and ignore your bait . 
  may the troll be fed . 
  please continue your masterpiece in this sub . 
  that is my experience as well , americans can be * too * polite indeed . 
   like , why would i greet someone when i come into the store , either ? 
  hahaha , that is typically french indeed , it happens to me as well sometimes to get in a store and just say `` excusez moi , vous avez ... '' and before i can finish my sentence i get a passive-agressive `` bonjour ? '' . 
  but i was more talking about accosting someone on the street . 
  well , people asking for directions in the us surely start with a `` excuse me , do you know ... ? '' . 
  sure americans have different codes than us , but they are very polite , as i said it happened only once . 
  for the tap water , it was for an airbnb , and i honestly had people for 20 different nationalities and only this woman asked me that . 
  i mean , really ? 
  no drinking tap water in paris ? 
  in a small village i could understand , but in the most touristic city in the world it 's very odd to ask this . 
  but again , these 2 were really the exceptions . 
   it is because 500 dollar in sweden is worth a whole lot less than 500 dollar in poland . 
  indeed , it 's a very good point a lot of people seem to miss with this kind of data . 
  the cost of manufacturing is also extremely important , this should be taken into account as well . 
  the uk or france produce a lot of their own weapons , but at a higher cost than russia for example . 
  you really met americans telling you this ? ... 
  parisian born and raised , i got asked directions/informations by american tourists 100 times , i 've never experienced this . 
  i 've had one jumping on me without a greeting asking me `` where is the closest mcdonald 's ??? '', 
  ( seriously ) , a woman asking me if it was safe to drink tab water , but all the others are very respectful and well-behaved people . 
  they 're way down the list of the most obnoxious tourists for me . 
  i think brits have a bad reputation is some countries like spain or greece because of the packs of youngsters going there to get shit faced , but we do n't have those in france and brits are definitely not seen as bad tourists . 
  you should buy some cr\u00e9mant , a lot are better than champagne . 
   all french wines are overpriced though . 
  that 's something that baffles me when i travel ( i 'm french ) . 
  even in london , not exactly a far-away exotic destination , french wines are overpriced . 
  and i do n't mean good ones , but shitty ones that cost 3 $ here can easily reach 20 # there . 
  and outside of europe it 's even worse . 
  i spent a semester in south korea , and i always bought chilean or argentinian wines for they were the only affordable . 
  they were very good , but i find it sad that normal french wine is too often only for posh people ready to pay an absurd price for a basic product . 
  the crusades man , never forget to mention the crusades at some point , it explains everything apparently . 
  please , tell me again when we bombed tunisia , where the guy who killed 84 people in nice was from . 
  and tell me when we bombed brussels , where abdeslam was from . 
  oh and coulibaly , who slaughtered jews in a supermarket , can i have an article about the time we bombed his home town , juvisy-sur-orge ? 
  i see what you mean , the sentence `` many french citizens sympathized with mrs. prieur '' is very vague though . 
  but it 's true the agents were not punished and even got promoted . 
  i think the logic behind this as you said is that they followed orders properly . 
  utterly stupid orders , but they 're not paid to have opinions . 
  so in this context , they did a good job . 
  obviously for the general public like you and i , it 's weird , but for the army it 's how it works . 
   though quite a few of the agents were promoted really ? 
  if you have a source for that i 'm interested . 
  again , totally agreed that france majorly screwed up and acted in a completely shameful manner on this . 
  accent failure in the copy/pasta of the title , but nice attempt . 
   the perpetrators were hailed as heroes upon their return to france . 
  i agree with the rest of what you said , but this is totally wrong . 
  along with the ministry of defence , the chief of the dgse resigned , and the agents were definitely not considered as heroes , but as stupid tools . 
  i mean , 2 of the highest officials resigning and the agents were hailed as heroes when they got back ? 
  where did you get this ? 
  i 'm genuinely curious , because here the rainbow warrior story is told as one of the most shameful episode of our recent history . 
   check out mali where they did n't care about human shields . 
   also if i remember correctly , few decades ago they blew up environmental activist ship ... 
  in a middle of ocean . 
  you do n't remember correctly , [ you 're talking about the sinking of the rainbow warrior , ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sinking_of_the_rainbow_warrior ) probably the most infamous failure of the dgse ( french secret services ) . 
  they sunk the ship that belonged to green peace who was protesting nuclear tests in the pacific . 
  sadly , the ship was not empty as the agents thought and a photographer died . 
  the ship was in the harbour , and it 's not like it was a small story , it was huge in new zealand and france , with the ministry of defence resigning . 
  i really do n't know where you got the whole `` the french do n't care about civilian casualties '' thing . 
   define violent . 
  slaughtering dozens of random people on the street , in concert venues or near football stadiums . 
  but of course you 'll reply with an essay on the definition of violence troughout history with multiple stupid comparisons like romas stealing a wallet being a form of violence , ending up with an open question like `` what really is violence afterall ? '', 
   maybe you should be more precise and say terrorists or something like hate crimes against the local population . 
  because of course non muslim foreigners are violent sometimes or involved in crime . 
  as of course are various locals . 
  in france , literally 100 % of the terrorists attacks and all the victims are the result of islamism . 
  it 's not * `` hate crimes against the local population '' * , it 's locals mass-killing other locals in the name of their ideology . 
  we 're not talking about crime or violence like a robbery , or someone being stabbed for a cigarette , we 're talking about terrorism . 
  thing is , we took millions of people in . 
  from very very different cultures than ours , from very different origins . 
  we welcomed muslims and still do , they can build mosques , practice their religion , etc , etc. . . 
  yet , they are the only one doing these horrendous things .

  no one aside from other americans believe this explanation that it 's all altruistic and in the name of peace . 
  funny thing , while i was sad about the gif , much of my sympathy for the polish dried up with this post , and the following post saying that the `` jewish were n't really polish '' . 
  this out of one of the countries that suffered the most under the nazis . 
  france was under occupation as well and only vichy collaborators say france should have allied with reich . 
  leave hitler be ? 
  you switched from france and the uk should have done more for the polish to you should have appeased the nazis more ? 
  are you out of your mind , the regime was a conquering genocidal group . 
  what is you end goal for this argument ? 
  edit : post originally did n't have the `` not '' , which may account for the confusion . 
  good to the hungarians for being honorable . 
  does n't excuse the death of the photographer . 
  the breton independance was severely affected after it accidentally killed a director during a protest . 
  edit : in essence careless deaths like that is unacceptable . 
  than i 'll only say what i said to someone else . 
  there is friendly relations and there is the current inexplicable tryst between moscow and washington . 
  this pretension that is all reasonable , especially in the context of trump 's attitude to other nations ? 
  it sounds hollow because it has gone far beyond just amicable relations . 
  keep in mind before you accuse us , that the main concern is that the u.s is far too inexpicably friendly . 
  your reasoning does not match the u.s 's recent actions , viewing the g20 . 
  until than i do n't speak for everyone , but i do n't trust the us motives in this affair a single bit . 
  the recent dual efforts to meddle in our elections via digital efforts from both the us and russia says this caution is not misplaced . 
  that 's certainly disingenuous . 
  there 's a difference between friendly relations and this unholy tryst between moscow and washington . 
  because currently that this is `` all in the name of peace '' sounds pretty disingenuous due to the rhetoric coming from both groups . 
  all diplomatic reputation and credibility , standing as a democracy , stability of nato , intelligence co-operation , as well as any form of diplomacy with countries who are not fans of russia which percolates to most dealings outside of internal affairs , and even than it seems that politics at home are responding to this . 
  seriously , you do n't see a possibe consequence of this political and diplomatic realignment . 
  the symbolic value of this event ? 
  this is why i say everything because it upended most status quo . 
  to see no risk is short sighted and shalllow . 
  edit : addressing your edit , iran is under the sphere of influence of russia . 
  it 's a bit ironic to say you do n't want wwiii than talk about pressuring china . 
  these diplomatic moves that you mention are going to backfire . 
  also `` no proliferation '' ? 
  trump started by saying he wanted to restart the construction of nuclear weapons . 
  `` trade '' , now that 's laughable . 
  the u.s has n't had a clear goal except an inexplicable love for dictatorships for the past few months . 
  everyone was saying how being the pm negotiating brexit would be a cursed job after cameron left . 
  if she did n't figure this out than , i ca n't give her any kudos for figuring it out now . 
  `` little to lose '' is an optimistic way to put it . 
  i would have said everything . 
  another british user said they would be more than happy to be in the single market just a few days ago . 
  even now i 'm not sure coming into the negotiations whether it will a hard or soft brexit . 
  is n't this from turkish `` bodyguards '' beating protesters in the us ? 
  i was thinking of something less shady than that ... 
  even if hamburg is on our mind , people can be interested in the environment conference without planning a raid . 
  or because outside of the single issue policies they are rather far-right . 
  i remember how americans would say that the fn was a leftist party . 
  the illusion of them being reasonable quickly fell apart once they started showing their true colours . 
  those who are labeled `` far-right '' are sometimes `` far-right '' . 
  interesting . 
  i could try be in the vicinity when it 's in progress . 
  did we mention lavoisier yet ? 
  they 're both big contributors to the periodic table ( among other things ) . 
  er , while i 'm flattered , it may be better if you refrained . 
  i 'm not authority figure , this is just my opinion on the topic . 
  i disagree with the polish government in certain areas , but i thought being against russia was one thing we all agreed on . 
  some people seem skeptical , but it should be noted that the war between germany and russia was particularly brutal and war crimes on civilians horrendous . 
  it 's not farfetched that a military commander for the nazis is featured . 
  `` he was just doing his job '' was n't a valid excuse even at the nuremburg trials . 
  you can detect the traces of bannon in that speech . 
  they 'll have to compete with leclerc as well as other supermarkets . 
  so , we beat the low countries . 
  that 's something . 
  it 's funny that the greek acceptance is n't that high , considering the jokes and stereotypes about them due what is known of classical greek history . 
  i doubt it . 
  he 's just another oligarch and his cutting of social protections and services , tax cuts on the ultra rich are n't reassuring and it seems that his base thinks that he 's for them because he often attacks foreigners ( which says some unpleasant things about americans ) . 
  the u.s does benefit from trade and if their economy is hurt , his base will also hurt . 
  with all the talks of `` jobs '' has there ever been a clear articulation of the economics behind alienating trading partners ? 
  they may no longer buy from us , but we also would n't buy from them . 
  edit : not to mention that we could try finding other trading partners , but where would the u.s go to ? 
  their economy is minuscule . 
  they 've already attacked japan and china . 
  india maybe , however they 're very protectionist as well . 
  even than , it 's not as if there 's a limit on trading partners , so this would all be a zero-sum game . 
  i think the notion that if we cut ourselves off from others our local economy would suddenly improve is the equivalent of the `` magical thinking '' used by china in the `` great leap forward '' . 
  euh , i would prefer that does n't happen . 
  prosecution for corruption ? 
  yes . 
  political assassination however is not acceptable in a democracy . 
  even with trump . 
  hmm , it 's disconcerting how much relations have degraded . 
  less than a year ago we would n't be so worried about getting into a trade war with the u.s. 
  good , after decades eastern europe is developping economically . 
  good news is always welcome . 
  the eu needs to find a solution for the porous outer border . 
  i do n't think the utter barbarity and depravity of the third reich should ever be forgotten . 
  as u/iwanttosaysmth said , this was beyond conquest into deliberate extermination . 
  mazzini , cavour and garibaldi . 
  i was n't familiar with the fourth one, 
  no argument from me on the first . 
  the amount seems to have changed and varies depending on what is included , from programs it opted in , pensions for it 's representatives etc. . . like the fishing issue presented here , it will likely be discussed later on . 
  i wo n't deny that the eu is using this bill as a sort of political bludgeoning tool , but whether it 's a reasonable or unreasonable we 'll have to see . 
  edit : in the end after all the hurt and anger over this issue , this is what it boils down to . 
  will the uk and eu put aside any enmity and at least limit the damages , or will they hurt each other in a lose-lose scenario ? 
  i do n't exactly want the uk to suffer , but i do n't want the eu to lose out in such a deal either . 
  to put it another way , if the uk government is willing to tone down rhetoric and work together there 's no reason for things to completely fall apart , but if the uk government will take any concessions as a show of victory against the eu , than what 's the point of `` going easy '' ? 
  i wo n't go into the topic of immigration 's ethics because frankly , i 've come out of an anti-immigration thread where someone started talking about how their german grandfather kept their `` nation pure '' and i got called a french cunt . 
  the degradation of political discourse has hit everyone hard . 
  of course , but there 's also the fact that even one year on there 's uncertainty over whether a hard or soft brexit is sought , someone else said their reason for brexit was that the eu was preventing the uk from getting `` easy deals '' with the rest of the world . 
  i would also like to point out that the uk did n't accept the refugee resettlement .

  and my guess that it went from the turkish word to the romanian version because relations between romania and turkey ( ottoman empire ) were n't very cordial . 
   agriculture implement came to signify penis , a wood remain became human genital hair ( yes , most are related to genitalia and sex ) . 
  that 's standard . 
  * hon hon *, 
  same in france . 
  fun fact : rahat in romanian means shit . 
  i 'm guessing it 's because romania and turkey had very cordial relations . 
  what was n't cool was the fact thet they basically destroyed the flowers and the candles put in place for the terrorist strike memorial . 
  the place where the protests happened were like 300m from the bataclan . 
  it 's more common to say plussoyer . 
   sounds like france needs to learn a thing or two from portugal . 
  indeed , and portugal can learn how not to be a poor country . 
  is that a fawlty towers reference ? 
  my man , my man . 
  yeah . 
  he 's getting karma points on reddit . 
  trully a winner . 
   cant trust any media source including reddit . 
  reddit 's nothing more than a soapbox . 
   no , a nunber of news outlets have reported it . 
  well give a sauce . 
   the most concrete info i have is from our pm interview right before the meeting an unbiased source . 
  the day i trust politicians to give me the news is the day i move into a cave or under a rock, 
  what rumors ? 
  you know somebody that knows somzbody that knows merkel ? 
  well you have to make a difference between a newspaper making stupid statements and a head of state ( pm in this case ) bursting an aneurism and starting bashing france . 
  dude . 
  i 'm no pm.i can speak whatever shit i want . 
  fun fact . 
  denmark and belgium send more jihadists per capita than france . 
  denmark get your shit together you lil european rednecks . 
  yeah . 
  the dude 's on his personal crusade . 
  hurrah !, 
  are you a flemish speaker ? 
  he did n't bash belgium . 
   france should get their shit together said the portuguese . 
  impossible to say . 
  she got about 17 % the last time , so it 'll be more . 
  probably around 30 % . 
  god seeing that retard trying to imitate a normal person made me cringe . 
  not much actually . 
  you can not give tax benefits left and right because you say so . 
  if netherlands disagrees , well nobody forces netherlands to be in the eu . 
   like direct state aid to airbus through low interest loans and tax cuts . 
  true . 
  lets see where airbus has its hq . 
  well airbus is owned by airbus group ... oh look at that netherlands . 
  how about we let them pay their fair share . 
  did i read this correctly ? 
  the dutc govt is fighting to ** not ** collect money ? 
  i should move to the netherlands . 
  those people are so polite , they wont even take your tax money . 
  ixelles , etterbeek , uccle . 
  not that special . 
  really ? 
  it was 2007 so no big games . 
  just at times , every 200-300 meters in ixelles someone would have a flag . 
  so odd . 
  i was explained that it was because people wanted to show that belgian patriotism is real . 
  do you still hand flags on the window ? 
  i was studying at ulb for a few months . 
  first time in my life that i 've seen people hanging flags at the window without it being a national holiday . 
  the whores, 
  the journey of a 1000 miles starts with 1 step . 
  or smth like that . 
  once they realise their society has n't crumbled because of the gays , they 'll maybe improve . 
  way to miss a point . 
  it 's like that was your goal . 
   geopolitical nice gesture uhm ... 
  i think we 're reading a bit too much in this story . 
  i dont know about you , but i 'm on the fence on who 's worse . 
  we should vote on it . 
  what did the flemish cat say : can i haz independentz ? 
  more like those sweet sweet arms deals . 
  10 billion . 
  go to an animal shelter and every time some adopts a dog , write a story . 
   he was responsible as a leader . 
  so kinda like how stalin was responsible for the death of several million ukrainians . 
  and that he could n't have ignored the famine happening in his country . 
  cool . 
  we reached a conclusion . 
  and do people have ownership deeds on these ? 
   you just need enough witnesses , traces and records okay . 
  then give me a witness , trace and record that says that hitler knew of the holocaust . 
   kolkhoz is a ** voluntary ** cooperative of ex-individual farmers yeah ... that 's why they disappeared after 1991 . 
  cuz they were `` voluntary '' . 
   if you are going to kill so many people history work is to record it . 
  yes . 
  i can see stalin writting down : `` dear diary , today i 'm planning to kill 100k ukrainian peasants . '', 
   if you do n't record it you are not doing history but propaganda , maybe you should use proper wording . 
  find me proof nixon ordered the watergate taps . 
  if you plan to do something evil , you do n't exactly leave a paper trail do you because `` guys we 're writing history here '' find me proof hitler knew about the holocaust . 
  that 's right ... good luck with that . 
   the problem was only cooperatives had fund to purchase them goddamit . 
  do n't you understant the kolkhoz had no money ? 
  l  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/collectivization_in_the_soviet_union look at the damn data : 1929 : 7 % of the agricultural land in collectives , 1933 : 83 % . 
  imagine a village has 10 farmers . 
  you steal their land and all their products and supplies . 
  they do n't become by magic rich in 4 years .

  now i live in slovakia , i do n't have to waste time kissing or shaking hands with people i see everyday , it 's great . 
  i just hug people i rarely see and i 'm genuinely happy to see . 
  now i will probably find kissing weird when i come back to france . 
  oh god , this stupid map again . 
  i 've been drinking tap water in slovakia for a year without any problem , restaurants bring you tap water if you ask and i 've even heard radio ads about drinking tap water . 
  the weirdest town name i saw in slovakia is hlin\u00edk nad hronom ( aluminium on the hron ) . 
  it sounds pretty soviet . 
  yes , `` je te pisse \u00e0 la raie '' ( i piss to your ass crack ) is a common phrase to express contempt to someone . 
  i discovered [ crumbed mushrooms ] ( http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_7zxwluwj5iu/teqboerq45i/aaaaaaaaeig/rk0tm067gv4/s1600/5555100_4633.jpg ) in slovakia . 
  it 's delicious , usually eaten with baked potatoes or fries and tatar sauce . 
  they crumb all kind of stuff here , including cauliflowers , broccoli and cheese . 
  i 've never needed to talk about this in english so i hope `` crumb '' is the right word . 
  it 's also interesting how many languages took the general french word for `` mushroom '' ( * champignon * ) to name common mushrooms , while in french they are called `` paris mushrooms '' . 
  i live in slovakia and a few weeks ago i spoke to an older czech woman ( not that old , maybe 50 ) . 
  at some point she said `` here in the czech republic '' . 
  interesting , it 's also the meaning of hungarian * h\u00fasv\u00e9t * . 
  last time i came back to france , just after christmas , i went through a shopping centre in paris with all my luggage . 
  one guard made me open my suitcase and then said `` it 's ok '' within one second , almost without seeing anything i had in it . 
  i really wondered what the point was . 
  that 's crazy , when i went to ukraine in 2011 , 1 euro was around 11 hryvnias , and now it 's more like 29 . 
  i like slavic languages . 
  russian probably is the most beautiful , followed by slovak and croatian . 
  czech sounds like a weird version of slovak to me . 
  finnish is beautiful too , and hungarian is not exactly beautiful but it sounds interesting . 
  italian sounds better than other romance languages ( i ca n't judge french because it 's my mother tongue ) . 
  among the germanic languages , swedish is my favourite . 
  and for some reason many languages are more beautiful when sung than when spoken ( such as german and polish ) . 
  on a related note , the indonesian word for water is * air * . 
   the first is that r\u0103zboi might derive from latin `` res bellum '' ( affair of war ) . 
  it does n't , [ it 's a slavic loanwoard ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/r%c4%83zboi ) . 
  i know quite a lot about slovakia because i 'm one of the rare crazy foreigners who live there . 
  i 'd love to visit slovenia though , i 've only been in ljubljana for a few days and the weather was awful . 
  why is there a tiny country in the middle of another country ? 
  what 's going on there ? 
   anywhere where roma does live i was pretty shocked when i visited zvolen . 
  i climbed the hill to pust\u00fd hrad , from there there 's a beautiful panorama , the city looks nice and clean , except for a small street where [ the buildings look like shit ] ( http://i.imgur.com/gkqqx5q.jpg ) ( apparently the roof burnt and now there are plants growing in it ) . 
  and here 's [ google street view in lun\u00edk ix ] ( https://www.google.com/maps/@48.6961045,21.2215846,3a,75y,209.2h,95.33t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sgge0zzfs4ynj7t9ib_mhiq!2e0!7i13312!8i6656!6m1!1e1 ) . 
  i do n't know about ukrainian and belorussian , but '' \u0441 \u043d\u043e\u0432\u044b\u043c \u0433\u043e\u0434\u043e\u043c '' definitely is the usual new year greeting in russian . 
  it 's the first time i hear about this . 
  same here , never had a problem in cdg . 
  the only thing i do n't like is that going to paris from there is expensive and the regional trains go through shitty suburbs . 
  yeah right , please tell me more about the separatist movement in normandy . 
  i 'm from france and i speak french , esperanto , english ; slovak and russian at an intermediate level , bad german , and in case of emergency i could probably express myself in polish or spanish .

  it really depends on languages and countries . 
  slovak people say `` je\u017ei\u0161 '' ( jesus ) or `` bo\u017ee '' ( god ) very often , while in france pretty much nobody uses religious swear words ( all curses involving `` god '' i can think of sound really outdated ) . 
   the french academy the one 99 % of french people do n't care about ? 
  and what about coluche ? 
  czechs and slovaks call computers po\u010d\u00edta\u010d , hungarians call them sz\u00e1m\u00edt\u00f3g\u00e9p and finns call them tietokone . 
  i 'm not sure i understand your point . 
   also the french being over nationalistic , inventing french words for every commonly english known word ( e-mail  couriel , walkman  baladeur , ... ) does n't help . 
  it 's funny how only the french are called `` nationalistic '' when they do this ( even though most of the proposed neologisms never catch on ) . 
  icelanders are probably the biggest languages purists in the world , but they are not `` nationalistic '' . 
  itt : ordinary french bashing . 
  i 've never met anyone in france who thinks french is `` superior '' , that the whole world should speak french or that `` i hate le english hon hon baguette '' , but please keep on spouting stereotypes . 
  in slovakia many restaurants offer a lunch menu which includes a soup and a main course for 3-4 $ . 
  in france , the best known is probably [ henri d\u00e9sir\u00e9 landru ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/henri_d%c3%a9sir%c3%a9_landru ) . 
  he murdered 11 people ( 10 women plus the son of his first victim ) from 1915 to 1919 . 
  til yannick and cyrille can be female names . 
  i 've never heard of women with these names . 
  it will never be in any official capacity because eu forbids linguistic discrimination and officially supports multilingualism . 
  but thanks for the random french bashing . 
  they 're still part of russia . 
  russia has cool flags , such as [ chuvashia ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d7/flag_of_chuvashia.svg/1280px-flag_of_chuvashia.svg.png ) , [ mordovia ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2f/flag_of_mordovia.svg/1200px-flag_of_mordovia.svg.png ) , [ yamalo-nenets autonomous okrug ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c7/flag_of_yamal-nenets_autonomous_district.svg/1280px-flag_of_yamal-nenets_autonomous_district.svg.png ) and of course [ zheleznogorsk ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/58/flag_of_zheleznogorsk.svg/1280px-flag_of_zheleznogorsk.svg.png ) . 
  in france , all regions apparently have [ flags nobody knows ] ( https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/liste_des_drapeaux_des_r\u00e9gions_et_territoires_fran\u00e7ais ) ( with few exceptions such as brittany and corsica , which have well-known flags ) . 
  i like the one of [ midi-pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7f/flag_of_midi-pyr%c3%a9n%c3%a9es.svg/1280px-flag_of_midi-pyr%c3%a9n%c3%a9es.svg.png ) , which is apparently the unofficial flag of occitania as well . 
  edit : zheleznogorsk is actually in asia . 
  i love them . 
  i learned russian and slovak . 
  i am conversational in both , but i 'm better at slovak . 
  they 're both beautiful languages . 
  declensions are n't that bad , i do n't really have problems with them ( except with less common words with weird declensions ) . 
  for me the real difficulty is verbs : the [ aspect ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/grammatical_aspect_in_slavic_languages ) is difficult to grasp if you do n't have it in your native language , and it does n't even work exactly the same way in slovak and russian . 
  and then you have all the prefixes , you can add almost any prefix to any verb and you get a verb that has a completely different meaning or that means almost the same but with a nuance i do n't get , which makes me feel like the vocabulary is infinite . 
  i also have some basic knowledge of polish and i 'd love to learn some slovenian or croatian , but i do n't plan soon and i would n't really have much use for them . 
  bulgarian and macedonian look interesting too , and belarusian sounds like weird russian . 
  it does , `` she '' is '' \u015di '' . 
  the chart is incomplete . 
   the world 's longest , nonstop domestic flight is paris to st. denis , r\u00e9union as well . 
  til , i expected moscow-vladivostok to be longer but map projections deceived me . 
   francuzsky kluc interestingly we call it `` cl\u00e9 anglaise '' ( english key ) in french . 
  to french  to prepare food by cutting it into strips . 
   to kiss ( another person ) while inserting one 's tongue into the other person 's mouth . 
  i 'm ok with this . 
  how do you know ? 
  do you speak it ? 
  this is incorrect . 
  esperanto literature has existed since it was created . 
  there 's a 740-page [ concise encyclopedia of the original literature of esperanto ] ( https://www.amazon.com/concise-encyclopedia-original-literature-esperanto/dp/1595690905/ref=cm_lmf_tit_2 ), 
  why ? 
  i speak it fluently , i can confirm it 's true . 
  the only places in france where i 've seen squat toilets in the last years are campgrounds . 
  camping in france seems to be popular among dutch tourists , maybe that 's where they see them . 
  i just look at [ official data ] ( http://statdat.statistics.sk/cognosext/cgi-bin/cognos.cgi?b_action=cognosviewer&amp;ui.action=run&amp;ui.object=storeid\\ ( % 22i0c852caa5451437c92774db33ec08675 % 22 \\ ) & ui.name = ve % c4 % bekostn % c3 % a9 % 20skupiny % 20obc % c3 % ad % 20 - % 20sr % 2c % 20oblasti % 2c % 20kraje % 2c % 20okresy % 2c % 20mesto % 2c % 20vidiek % 20 % 5bom7023rr % 5d & run.outputformat = & run.prompt = true & cv.header = false & ui.backurl = % 2fcognosext % 2fcps4 % 2fportlets % 2fcommon % 2fclose . html & run.outputlocale = sk ) and there are 993 municipalities in slovakia with 1,000 inhabitants or more . 
  i think the map shows only the [ 140 municipalities ] ( https://sk.wikipedia.org/wiki/zoznam_miest_na_slovensku ) that have the status of town . 
  occitan is still more spoken than several languages that appear on this map ( manx , faroese , sami ... ) . 
  not for most people in france .

  liberalism is about protecting liberty while laissez-faire is about not intervening , they are opposites when intervening protects the rights of individuals better than doing nothing . 
  liberal is not primarily an economic term , and in particular it 's not a synonym of `` laissez faire '' . 
  that 's an `` absolute '' view of the right to property , and absolute rights have a tendency to impede on other rights and become privileges , which is why the french human rights declaration of 1789 defines liberty as the balance between one 's rights and other people 's rights . 
  devaluation is about the exchange rates with other currencies while inflation is about the prices inside the currency zone . 
  hyper-inflation is very very fast inflation whose causes and effects are different to those of normal inflation . 
  hyper-inflation is irrelevant in most discussions since it can only happen when something is very wrong , not under normal circumstances . 
  you 're mixing devaluation , inflation , and hyper-inflation , which are three different phenomena . 
   we 'll have to centralize and elect an eu federal president by direct vote at some point imho . 
  right , let 's concentrate more power into fewer hands , what could possibly go wrong ? 
  the point was that it would be a eurozone-wide transfer mechanism without requiring a full fiscal union . 
  it 's not meant to fix everything , it 's just a simple first step . 
  i would include all adults instead of `` working age people '' , it 's simpler . 
  profits were lower than usual in 2014 because of the ecb 's policies , which could have been different if it was already giving money directly to the citizens of the zone , since it could have done more of that instead of ineffective quantitative easing . 
  so yes , less than 5 euros would be a bit ridiculous , but it would probably still be a good idea just to put the infrastructure in place and sneak in the idea that it 's okay for the central bank to distribute money directly to the citizens . 
  what would it break ? 
  i said so in my message , the idea is to distribute it directly to the people instead of the governments . 
  i have n't actually computed the amount , it could be relatively low indeed , still even 18 $ per adult citizen would be useful . 
  also , distributing the profits could be merely the first step , once we have the infrastructure in place to send money directly to all adult citizens of the zone and people get used to the idea , we could start talking about distributing more money that way . 
  maybe , i wonder what the official arguments against it would be . 
  that 's not the role of a central bank . 
  you have to keep powers separate and balanced , otherwise you get corruption and other issues . 
  simpler idea : redistribute the profits of the ecb directly into the bank accounts of the citizens of the eurozone ( same amount for everyone ) instead of giving it to the governments based on capital shares in the ecb . 
  suddenly a lot of people would like the ecb more , including the greeks . 
  we do n't give free money to illegal immigrants , we give survival money to refugees . 
  writing free software ( a crowdfunding website ) . 
   because it 's wrong , murder is a specific term that applies when a human kills another human . 
  that may be the current legal meaning in most countries , but etymologically the word simply means `` to cause death '' . 
  it looks like popcorn time seeds while you 're watching the video and has no option to disable seeding entirely nor to keep seeding after the download is complete . 
  it 's possible to leech well-seeded torrents , though it 's considered bad practice . 
  however unlike what the article implies we still see your ip address even if you 're only downloading . 
  bi is n't socialism , and it 's mostly neutral to the middle class ( assuming it 's funded properly ) since median income earners are around the equilibrium point where bi - taxes = 0 . 
  the middle class funds its own bi and the rich class funds the bi of the poor ( it 's a bit more complicated in reality , but you get the idea ) . 
   no , that would n't work . 
  what ? 
  a sovereign fund that invests in foreign assets ? 
  that 's exactly what the norwegian fund you love so much does , same as other sovereign funds . 
   but you need to have cash in the first place having cash is n't really an issue , you do n't even need oil or other natural resources . 
  for example the french government controls hundreds of billions of euros of savings collected through the [ livret a ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/livret_a ) . 
   could you give me a specific example of an exception in france ? 
  one big exception is young people under 25 years old . 
  basically the state does n't want to help them if it considers that their parents have enough money to do it instead . 
  the problem is that too often the parents ca n't or wo n't help as much as the state think they could and should . 
  a very important property of bi is that it is individual , it does n't matter if your parents or spouse are filthy rich , you all get your own bi and the rich among you pay the taxes that fund it . 
   other parts would become poorer not really , rich people would have a little less cash , cry me a river . 
   other negative effects could happen anything can happen , but i have yet to see any evidence that bi would have significant negative effects . 
   who is going to do that ? 
  why would they ? 
  what do they get for it ? 
  are you asking how investment works ? 
  you have cash , you lend to an organization who wants it in exchange for a promise to pay it back later with interest , you profit . 
  a sovereign fund can do exactly that , and by investing in foreign stuff it can fund a part of a basic income by extracting profits from other countries . 
   unless you somehow are illegal or an addict refusing help this is not really the case . 
  maybe your country 's welfare system is extensive , or perhaps you 're just not aware of its corner cases . 
  in france there are several situations in which you 're not eligible for welfare , even though you need it and are not an illegal . 
   these kind of things would still happen under bi . 
  bi reduces the number of conditions to one or two ( legal residence and citizenship ) , so no , it does n't have stupid exceptions . 
   external funds coming into a region or the same funds pumped around is a big difference . 
  as the village is a poor part of the country , a country-wide bi would still pump more funds into that village than taxes would take back . 
  i agree that the positive effects could be lower , but in my opinion it 's likely that it would n't be as big a difference as you claim . 
   a basic income , which is n't funded by external parties a bi can be ( partially ) funded by external parties , you 've been advocating the sovereign fund method yourself . 
   as such it would affect others in the region negatively through higher taxes and macro economic effects we ca n't really know what the effects would be , maybe the other villages also receiving bi would have boosted economic activity even more . 
   left out of what ? 
  left out as in you 're poor but do n't qualify for welfare because of some stupid condition . 
   too much bureaucracy is a relative thing . 
  again , that 's easy to say when you 're not personally affected by it . 
  i think you 've missed the point : it could have been a country-wide basic income funded by the country itself and the effect on that village would likely have been similar to the results of the experiment . 
  the experiments are n't a waste , they 've shown that unconditional cash transfers are efficient in underdeveloped countries . 
  now we need to determine if the effects are similar in europe . 
  i do n't know the details of your country 's welfare system , but since there is a bi movement in the netherlands i assume there are defects same as in my country , typically people being left out , too much bureaucracy , etc. 
   basically they gave a village free money and looked at what happened . 
  of course , their happiness , but also their economics improved . 
  why ? 
  because simply more money was put into their system . 
  that 's not really true , the money could have easily come from that country 's budget and the results would likely have been the same . 
  instead of international organizations it would have been the rich part of the country that would have pumped money into the poor part . 
   what is the gain vs potential loss ? 
  how would you even estimate that ? 
   and in my opinion definitely not worth it at this moment . 
  that 's easy to say for people who do n't suffer from the defects of the current system . 
   the problem with most bi discussions is that no one seriously discusses the costs because most discussions are between people who do n't enough about bi to talk about the details . 
  we actually have a pretty full study about funding in my country , but not many people take the time to read all of it . 
  unemployment benefits are an insurance , not a welfare program that can be simply replaced by a bi . 
  the cost is definitely not 9x , iirc it 's more like 3x the cost of the programs that bi would actually replace . 
  also , the gross cost of bi is misleading , it 's not like e.g. 
  the military or education budget , because the tax money that funds bi is cash that goes right back to citizens . 
  in other words , if the military budget is 25 % of gdp , it 's very high , if bi `` costs '' 25 % of gdp , it 's okay . 
   ok , this sounds good , but it 's not a huge change . 
  i think many people who have actually experienced the regular useless visits and paperwork would disagree with you on that , it 's a big change . 
  you ca n't fight drug addictions ( including alcohol and cigarettes ) by not giving money to the addicts . 
  it 's easier ( and cheaper in administration cost ) to give to everyone and take back from the rich in taxes than it is to track who qualifies for welfare . 
  bi is n't meant to replace everything . 
  for example it ca n't replace proportional rent subsidies if rents vary too much from place to place since bi is the same amount for everyone . 
  another category of things that ca n't be replaced by bi is insurance , e.g. 
  unemployment insurance , because the amount you receive depends on how much money you previously poured into the fund . 
  bi is individual and children also receive it ( usually a lower amount than adults , typically half ) , so a single parent would receive 1050 $ ( in your 700 $ scenario and assuming half for children ) . 
  it 's not a zero-sum change , some people will pay more taxes than before , others less . 
  another important change is that the poor wo n't have to continuously ask for money and justify that they need it , they 'll receive it automatically . 
   tbh , vouchers are better than giving the money directly . 
  that way you know that they are spending on what they really need . 
  experiments have proven that this is wrong .

   what should we do now ? 
  first , it has to be made clear that the european union can not be reduced to a vast zone of free movement of goods , services and capital with no fiscal , social and regulatory counterpart . 
  to be sustainable , economic growth requires public services , infrastructures , systems for education , research and health , university exchanges , regional equalization , equality of opportunity and all this has a cost .

  something that nobody has done since , seeing the state of the afghani provinces . 
  the pashtun are still considering themselves as victims of the establishment and tgmhe establishment tries to counteract this , failing , making the situation worse , and it goes on . 
  had massoud lived and gathered more power afghanistan may have been on the road to modernisation today , instead of being the hellhole it is . 
  massoud was a taliban when the soviets invaeded/put in place a puppet government . 
  he was n't the extremist warlord , as a matter of fact , he was a person sharing our values , respectfull of others , whether or not foes or enemy . 
  it 's just that the taliban became what they became , however they were much more moderate before , as they were an `` agglomeration '' of people that wanted freedom for afghanistan , may they be trigger happy pyrotechnicians or sensible people , such as massoud . . 
  sadly , the islamist ones prevailed . 
  i only have respect for him , as he embodied the progress that could have characterised a country that was on track to be the most stable of the region , with its own brand of freedom , influenced by blthe american establishment , but with also french/european ideals while keeping true to the local principkes , trying to unite the tribes . 
  i 'm not trying to denigrate him by calling him a talibab , which you probably though i was doing . 
  massoud was also a taliban , yet not a radical islamist . 
  had he not diesmd , afghanistan * might * have not been such a fucked up place . 
  edit : was conflatibg two thibngs + was/am hangover, 
   i do n't see why this makes a difference . 
  it 's just a saber . 
  sabers have one edge , so naturally their back is smaller , but they 're also not as tapered . 
  in terms of actual weight , i think the katana is heavier than a lot of comparable european swords . 
  it 's a saber at a time where sabers did not exist , or were not plentiful in europe . 
   falchions were carried by longbowmen in henry v 's army if i remember right , they 're definitely medieval . 
  again , as for cutting , the katana 's fat blade makes it tougher to get through armour . 
  it also has a bit more mass , so if you 're riding on horseback then chopping through someone with relatively light armour can be quite devastating . 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnwrvzteeb8&amp;list=plbp7ebidrbagjjwqqm_rt0nbrqgpgifc7&amp;index=20 ( warning volume ) you 're right , they were even used before the medievals all-together , but apparently were phased out and were n't as popular . 
  sounds weird , as it seems like a very effective weapon . 
  the katane may be fatter but it 's also less wide from edge to spine . 
  you may be right but unless we measure the surface of the section of the forward parts and compare them with each other we ca n't determine which is what . 
  you may be right . 
   when i say well made i mean good mail , good plate , even good armour made of more common materials , like leather . 
  a katana is not just going to cut through that and even if it does , damage will be minimal . 
  thrusts historically have been a lot more lethal than cuts as well . 
  single chainmail is very weak , especially at a time when the links were not `` closed '' and the steel used of poor quality and carbon content . 
  leather will also behave very differently with a blade sharpened with a 500 grit stone and a 20k grit stone . 
  i know that from personal experience and i can not be convinced otherwise . 
  whether or not a weapon will be effective will again be impacted by the thickness as a , say 5mm leather layer is going to offer less protection than 2cm . 
  it also depends on how many layers there are , is it x thickness of cow leather or of i.e. 
  boar leather , which will be sturdier ? 
  i 'm fairly sure there are differences even on where the leather is taken from the animal itself . 
  thrusts are also very much possible with a katana . 
   the katana was not some kind of hugely useful weapon that the japanese obsessed with in actual war . 
  i never said otherwise mate , i agree with you saying that it was only used by the elite , perhaps in only certain cases , but the argument boils down to whether or not the european swords ( which ones is to be seen ) are better than katanas ( or generally japanese swords ) . 
  my argument is that the question itself is not correct because it would be comparign two weapons with very different purposes , uses and number of users . 
  a comparison that would be useful would be whether or not european forces are better than japanese forces when they use one specific weapon . 
  what are the conditions that affect each the combat , armor , terrain etc and that is assuming the skill level of each person is the same and that the conditions prior to the battle are the same , which in whole is very much impossible to create , especially considering europeans never made battle against the japanese in a medieval or even rennaissance setting . 
  continuing on to your points :  a european longsword can be half-sworded quite easily , giving a very precise short spear to use in close quarters . 
  a katana can do something similar but the point is not very flexible or very long and the blade is fairly small ( one handed sword with two handed grip ) , so actually getting it into the gaps is trickier . 
  getting out a knife in wrestling range would probably be easier . 
  i do n't know about the flexibility of the blade , it 's laminated with one part being hard and one being soft , therefore there is still some degree of flexibility . 
  tests must be conducted to determine that , even simple ones , which i ca n't / do n't know how to do . 
  as for getting a knife out when in wrestling range , well , that 's the sensible thing to do . 
  you do n't take an anti tank rifle for combat in a trench , you take a knife , a shovel or a pistol/machine pistol . 
   as for lamellar armour , it does n't literally mean there are gaps in the armour , the metal plates are over each other , you ca n't just slide through a gap , especially with a sword that ca n't really flex . 
  depends again on which armour , roman ones could flex , therefore your blade wo n't need to as much . 
  not flexing also does not mean that it will break , a low carbon steel will break with a pressure of , say , 1500 mpa while a tool steel will break at 2000 . 
   it 's not just about damascus steel , but improved smithing in general , where you could make swords on an industrial scale . 
  churn them out fast and at high quality . 
  never said the opposite but the difference between steel from 1500 and 1900 is incredible , from 1900-2000 perhaps even more . 
  and the thing is that the quality of the top quality japanese swords was of a rather high standard a long time before the indian steel was traded by the norsemen . 
  small parenthesis here , supposedly merovingians managed to create a version of wootz steel before having access to it from the indians , but that the secret got lost . 
  do n't know more about that tho . 
   they did n't need a possible masterpiece in a year , they needed 15 good swords in a month and i 'd ** wager the quality of katanas was far worse overall than the quality of european swords during the 1500s ** , because time is precious and smiths are not all masters . 
  that 's a pretty big assumption . 
  as you say , hammering the crap out of iron reduces inclusions , but that may be just enough for the blade to be of a high quality . 
  in modern steel we still have inclusions , sulfur and phosphorus and if needed almost no others . 
  in japanese blades they melted away the inclusions without melting the sword itself , and conveniently both the sulphuric and phosphoric inclusions melt at a lower point than steel . 
  inclusions of other metals , such as chrome , titanium , tungsten , vanadium , manganese and molybdenum and many others do not . 
  discounting also the potential traces of other rare occurring metals which can have an impact . 
  inconsistent perhaps , on a national level , but not so much on a specific mine level . 
  also , the improvements in terms of steel can be directly seen in the mere geometry of european sword : at first we had rather short swords that became increasingly long and thin , showing the evolution towards a purer , more elaborated alloy . 
   that 's also probably why katanas were restricted to the upper class . 
  there just was n't enough good material to manufacture swords for all the various armies in japan . 
  by contrast , in europe , almost every medieval infantryman would have a sword by the 1400s , it became standard kit . 
  agreed , but there are also the societal factors . 
  people were banned from having sword in public in france in the 17-18th century if i remember well if they did not belong to the various corps serving the king . 
   european swords and the katana are not ` faster ' or ` slower ' than each other , the speed depended on the strength of the wielder . 
  some europeans swords were far lighter than the katana , some were heavier , and smithing got to a point where even greatswords in europe were manufactured relatively lightweight for their size . 
  i use those terms poorly but the point i was trying to make was that with a katana you can have the speed and the effect you may have with a heavier european sword , albeit limited to non armored targets or to swordsmen with lightning reflexes , able to exploit every little crevice in the foe 's armour . 
  as for throwing a sword , here 's a video , seems pretty good : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtc_1hrgbuo i also like the move where you grab your sword from the cutting edges and use it as a club , with the cross guard trying to crush or pierce the helmet or the enemy , or get through a crack . 
   katanas are actually very fat blades compared to european swords . 
  there 's a misunderstanding on my part here , i mean if you see the `` profile '' of the sword , from edge to spine , it 's less than from edge to edge from a european sword . 
   katanas are not that much better cutters than a lot of comparable european swords . 
  falchions , for instance , are also vicious cutters ... 
  i consider falchions as sabers , that 's why i excluded them from my comparison , but indeed the falchion has a wide cutting edge , probably carries more weight with it too however i do n't think one can compare them since the falchion is not a medieval weapon ( or so i think , apologies if msitaken ) , while the katana is more or less the same since the medievals . 
   you ca n't cut through well made armour with any sword . 
  define well made . 
  padded `` armor '' can be well made , and so can be chainmail but a sword can penetrate both . 
  it depends on which sword , which armor specifically , it 's thickness and probably many more factors . 
  also , do not assume armor was always well made , for example roman armor and swords were in many cases of very poor quality ( not necessarily always ) . 
  also , in an attempt to cut a limb impair an arm or generally wound an enemy one can hit the armour , in which case i think my comparison is pretty valid , with the katana falling short and the european sword surviving longer/with less damage . 
   precision with a katana is not any more significant a factor than any other sword . 
  katanas are only really truly effective against someone who is n't wearing much armour , like your average lower status warrior or rebellious peasant who wo n't pay his taxes . 
  the katana can permit a greater degree of precision however , considering the taper through the length of the blade is more even than , say , a random greatsword . 
  they are as you say more effective against flesh and light armor , which is one of the reasons why the grind is such , it 's made for slashing , thus needing the least resistance , the same way a straight razor will cut a beard with more ease and less resistance than an axe , no matter the degree of honing . 
   ... into the gaps in the armour ... 
  agreed again , however i 'd add that this may be easier with a katana , considering the geometry and the fact some types of samurai armor was lamellar . 
   katanas were crafted in their specific way because they did n't have good materials to work with ( even today japan imports iron from other places ) . 
  european smithing had moved on and the process which forged european swords produced weapons of just as good quality as your average katana far more cheaply and faster . 
  japan still uses it 's local mineral for certain uses , but probably few nowadays . 
  when you say even today . . you must know that also most of the eu imports its iron from other places , namely australia . 
  it is then made into steel in the blast furnaces or used in the making of cast iron . 
  also , supposedly , traditionally made japanese iron brought a finer grain to the steel , however that 's not something i 've found source for , nor have i tested any japanese steel . 
  perhaps additives were the reason for this , coming from the impure nature of the raw material . 
  european processes moved on ona different time however , around the 10th cetury , with the improvement being slow if my memory is correct , while ( from what i heard , might be wrong ) the japanese had very little changes since before that time .

  if you say you do n't give a shit ... how about you start by not giving a shit ? 
   stop making ridiculous claims about people you do n't know . 
  exactly . 
  people should mind their own business , 
   i care where he 's buried though because the queen bought a burial place for them for 29 million kroners , loaned from the state , a few years ago . 
  why do you care though ? 
  if it 's a loan , you 'll get it back . 
  and regarding his personal decision ... again it 's personal . 
  if i pay 3 million euros to have you buried somewhere , does that mean you have to accept ? 
   it had been expected that the pair would be buried together in a specially-designed sarcophagus at roskilde cathedral . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/roskilde_cathedral seems to be a cathedral where you bury royalty in denmark . 
  was he consulted when the decision to pick the burial place was made ? 
  how would you like it if people told you where you should be buried because you had so and so job ? 
  i did seem to rustle some feathers . 
   well certainly nothing remotely close to the german approach did people forget the percentage agreements already ? 
   censoring facebook , twitter and youtube . 
  coming from a brit that 's waaay funny . 
   sabotaging the eu ? 
  yeah . 
  random redditor from slovakia sure has that power . 
   i agree that the statement that everything can be forced through the eu parliament is wrong , but that does n't mean a country can not be outvoted within the eu decision-making process . 
  so ... is n't that the idea of joining a union ? 
  when you marry someone , do you get your say in everything and everything must be done according to what and how you want ? 
  sometimes you do shit you do n't like because you 're in an union . 
  if you can cherry pick whatever you live and ignore what you do n't ... well we 've seen how that works . 
   not wanting to be buried alongside your wife she is not her wife first and foremost , she is the queen of denmark . 
  she does not act as a wife but as a ruler of a country . 
  you do n't get to be buried in the cathedral where they bury kings and queens of denmark by being an average danish spouse . 
  she will not be buried with fellow family , but with fellow rulers of denmark . 
  family that were not rulers do n't get to be buried there . 
  looking how things were set up , they most likely did n't even talk it amongst themselves as a couple where to be buried . 
  if your spouse ceo of company x tells you one day : hey i 'll get buried with my fellow former ceos of company x , you 're invited to come along , i think you 'd be pretty pissed , would n't you ? 
   not really about the burrial though have you read the article . 
    it 's maddening for me where the hell did i use that word ? 
  dude are you fake quoting me ? 
   people are n't only calling him petty for not wanting to get buried with the queen . 
  / u/ttt -12 literally said he 's not danish . 
  so yeah with 99.99 % certainty that 's the only thing he knows about henrik, 
   but what i wo n't fucking tolerate is someone complaining about the life in luxury that we you 're arguing about where some dude said he 'll want to get burried . 
  and ** you 're ** arguing that others are petty ? 
  are you for real dude ? 
   the tax paying citizens , provided him with . 
  then stop having a monarchy . 
  what 's this ? 
  i give you money but i get to decide how and when and what to speak ? 
   well , he used to have french citizenship , which i think was his point ... 
  he 's danish now , he 's not french . 
  it 's odd that someone that has been danish for 50 years gets thrown in his face how he came from elsewhere . 
  it 's a very very high probability that he 's been danish for far longer than you or / u/myroomatemyroommate . 
  it all makes it seem so petty . 
   do n't come here and take our money and then bitch about petty things . 
  wow , that is surely to make him feel accepted . 
  he has no french citizenship , he 's all yours . 
  it amazes me that people get so petty about something that is ultimately a person decision . 
   he 's a fucking ass hat . 
  why do you give such a shit where someone you never met decides to get buried ? 
  holy shit , you guys deserve henrik , you 're all petty . 
   to avoid your wife over alll eternity that 's not exactly how death works . 
  that being said , we can argue that he does n't want to be buried in a cathedral considering he did n't feel like he belonged in that context . 
  i do n't get what people 's beef is . 
  we can very well argue that it 's odd that the queen does not wish to be buried with her family , why be buried in a stuffy cathedral ? 
  honestly , it 's their personal decision , what do you care one way or the other ? 
   there is no job description and everybody has an opinion on how you should do your job . 
  everybody looks on closely on what and who you do . 
  i was about to disagree with you , the i realised that we 're arguing about where a person wishes to be buried and criticizing him for that , even though it 's one of the most personal decisions one can make . 
   heck , i 'd even support expelling their ambassador , yes i heard escallating really helpes to solve problems . 
  thanks for pointing that out to . 
  communism only affected certain parts of the globe . 
  while gw will affect every human being . 
  yes indeed capitalism as we have it now is the best system there is and no way are we approaching a cliff that will mean many many will suffer unless we change radically what we have now . 
     that is not to say global warming does n't screw us too . 
  so your estimate that by the time gw will be over , the number of deaths caused by it will be lower than that caused by communism ? 
   whenever someone comes up with a viable alternative . 
  so global warming is the viable alternative ? 
  i had the impression we 're in deep shit . 
   no one is purposely attempting to create global warming , they just do n't care . 
  no one is purposely creating economies based on non-stop consumption ? 
  are you sure about that ? 
  it 's the growth of the gdp the holy grail of our economies ? 
  if you gdp grows , you are an awesome economy , if it stagnates , oh dude , you have huge problems . 
  is that again indifference ? 
  so global warming wo n't entail massive levels of human suffering ? 
  wow , i like your optimism . 
   when every single time you attempt something , it ends in massive , horrifying levels of human suffering ... 
  when will we tackle global warming caused by our incessant consumption ? 
  shit has amazing grip . 
  i 'm happy when i go to italy because food is so much cheaper there . 
  * cries in french *, 
   the people do n't suspsect a thing yeah . 
  great spelling dude . 
  absolute value scale . 
  the ceo of france changed and this new one wanted a better deal . 
   because these are private companies so why are you talking about european values then if you have a vision of private companies ? 
  private companies have no european values , they have only one value maximize profits . 
   the french state is inserting itself in this . 
  the french state has 1/3rd of the shares and it has the right of first refusal . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/right_of_first_refusal so no they 're not inserting themselves . 
  they 're the most important shareholder . 
   if macron truly sees himself as an europeist , so wanting to split 50-50 is n't wanting equality amongst europeans ? 
  because for me that is precisely what equal distribution between europeans is .

well , i 'm angry i took a moderate position , and on one side i 'm some stereotypical aristocrat and on the other hand i 'm a populist ? 
  screw you !, 
  you 're both extremists , you 're what 's wrong with the current political dialogue . 
  heretic : any person with half a brain can see that it 's easier to kill people with a gun and both sides have used enough manipulated statistics to support their point that any truth is politicized . 
  theo : of course it 's a disaster . 
  i 'm acknowledging that i can understand the concerns , but i do n't feel the need to belittle their fears . 
  go on , try to mock the constituency , see how that goes . 
  you 're not doing this to reassure it 's to sate whatever sick need to feel superior you have . 
  keep me out of whatever issues you both have . 
  i 'm copying this to both of you , because if we 're doing some calling out than i want to do it to the two extremes . 
  well , i 'm angry i took a moderate position , and on one side i 'm some stereotypical aristocrat and on the other hand i 'm a populist ?

  i 'm against the arming of citizens , but i ca n't really blame them with the current fear of terrorists . 
  i just hope it does n't come to that . 
  good news , and it 's interesting although i wonder how much of the change is due to improvements in classification , or detection technology . 
  the growth of the forests in general seems to have happened rather quickly . 
  a good part of africa really . 
  although , i sort of wonder why in the uk , since you 're either visiting spain or you 're trying to copy the us . 
  do n't you have multiple language classes , or is it just one ? 
  technically speaking the best language to speak would be mandarin . 
  edit : you 're done ? 
  that 's sad , the exchanges and back and forth was fun . 
  yup , is n't bilingualism wonderful ? 
  i ca n't really do otherwise on an american site . 
  oh , my mistake . 
  the english team was it ? 
  not like any of them made it . 
  a good part of the western world and then some . 
  england got conquered by france , remember ? 
  that 's pretty much why your language has a lot of french words . 
  ah , you 're uncomfortable when it starts being about history , i take it ? 
  seeing as you have to keep going back to sports . 
  might as well then . 
  we beat germany anyway so that enough for me , though from what i remember from the last euro cup , at least we did n't wash out because of iceland . 
  did n't that make the british team , the most expensive one in the cup with also the worst results ? 
  i thought it was more of the iraq war , where you were easily manipulated into traipsing into iraq . 
  while i remember the french were the only ones who saw through that bullshit . 
  how did that work out anyway ? 
  course i ca n't really take wwii away from , that was really the last time the uk was really relevant . 
  yes , especially so . 
  however , using an american born stereotype ? 
  pathetic from a brit . 
  if you even are one . 
  mainly because everyone realized you lot were too cowardly to actually invoke article 50 , which brings us to the original point . 
  hey , at least now we wo n't have the puppet of the us vetoin ' g every eu measure . 
  who cares about the olympics . 
  i was talking about the economy . 
  although if the games are the only way for you guys to feel better , be my guest . 
  5th economically in the world , but what 's wrong ? 
  i heard the uk is 6th now , although i could n't expect them to know viewing their abysmal education . 
  that 's not a proper sentence , and is irrelevant . 
  the `` other two '' are not particularly popular among the young , at least from where i 'm from , so while the opinion poll on merkel is understandable , i 'm curious about the demographics of those picked . 
  you think so ? 
  you do n't think the eu has some capacity to implement some measures if the uk refuses to activate the article until 2019 , when they 've said that the uk must activate article 50 24 hours after the referendum , without groveling for them to come back ? 
  i 'll call your bluff , you lot are n't as special as you think you are . 
  how damned arrogant do you brits have to be that you think we wo n't dislike you for harming the rest of the eu due to this stupid ploy ? 
  you want to play political games , you hate the eu , that 's fine but do n't leech off it while doing so . 
  all the while hurting the economy of both parties due to uncertainty . 
  either leave or do n't , because otherwise i 'll be more for the eu to kick them out . 
  this half-antagonistic situation between the uk and the eu can not continue . 
  either leave or stop the rhetoric and work with the other nations . 
  i feel sorry for the unemployed germans if their countryman hate them that much ... 
  i mean he 's weak , but i would say he 's personally better for that . 
  better be weak than a monster i say . 
  take merkel , who 's austerity measures have hurt a lot of people , and i 'm not going to even mention trump and may . 
  i wonder where they got their sample from . 
  okay , that explains things . 
  thank you . 
  theresa may is another politician which i never thought i would see in power . 
  that 's a more charitable view of it , although it could instead say that there 's been a change in leadership . 
  how is boris still in politics anyway ? 
  i thought he was shamed for his cowardice when he refused to take the position as pm ? 
  you 're british , so i 'll defer to your experience , but as a foreigner , i 'll like to point out that most people will not see consolation in that and ukip is still not a well liked entity , since they 're also the ones who championed the brexit . 
  heh , seeing the rate of anti-every single foreigner crimes in the uk post-brexit , i do n't think the two are mutually exclusive . 
  quite the opposite in fact . 
  sorry , i do n't think i 'm expressing myself well or there 's some error of communication . 
  nothing about revenge . 
  i 'm talking about the uk . 
  turkey was just an example of a country getting closer to russia . 
  blackmail is more the style of the uk to get concession of the eu , in the case of turkey it 's more that they 're balancing and changing their relationships between their neighbors . 
  so actually , i should rephrase that , sorry . 
  the uk is trying to copy turkey in the hope of getting leverage over the eu . 
  one , this was almost a week ago and here 's the data . 
  http://www.statista.com/statistics/270409/national-debt-of-greece/ original debt was 374 billion dollars , and you did n't even have to pay for all that . 
  it 's a 174 % of their gdp , whereas italy is a 132 % and the uk is at 90 % . 
  ( source eurostat ) . 
  in comparison greece lost a good percentage of their gdp in the past five years in it 's climate of austerity , not counting the loss of normal gdp growth between these years , including that you have the loss of the gpd of most other nations in the eu from the weakness of the euro . 
  i 'll do more research for the math of the money lost due to this , but one reason why the eu did n't recover from the recession as well as the us was due to this austerity . 
  however seeing as the debt was less than one percent for the major economies at the time ( world bank , look at the chart ) , and the austerity crisis has made sure that even growth has n't really gone back to pre-2010 levels . 
  i can confidently say it was more expensive to let greece suffer than just buy back the debt and get the situation over with . 
  http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/ny.gdp.mktp.cd do you have anything to back your side up ? 
  two , you 've just been regurgitating that 's your opinion , which is worse than anything else . 
  why even bother posting if you 're not going to add anything ?

i am not implying that these make perfect sense , i am implying that terrorism was not the only driving force behind these laws . 
  -------- if you want my opinion on the subject , then i think that the only sane thing to do is to reduce the demand for ( illegal ) guns . 
  to go back to my example of the gun related crimes in france , they pretty much all have to deal with drug trafficking , similarly to the mafia in italy . 
  i think that de-penalizing drugs and sending drug addicts to rehab instead of prison ( maybe even legalizing , controlling and selling them like alcohol is ) will stop crimes related to drugs . 
  i believe swiss is doing something similar ? 
  if drug related crimes stop , the demand for illegal guns to commit those crimes also stops , which leads to fewer illegal guns entering the continent . 
  i do wish for a eu wide relaxation on drug laws , but then , the european parliament is not populated with people who can do basic maths like that . 
  then terrorism is a special case . 
  for example , apart from everyone 's favourite religion , the basque separatists are/were also pretty active in terrorism , as well as the corsican in france . 
  those need to be dealt with on a case by case scenario . 
  i know that i 'm french and that i am not supposed to speak ( proper ) english but let 's look at my sentence you quoted :  the law might not not talk about illegal weapons comming in but his comment sure does : this was in response to someone ( a tad ignorant , but there is nothing wrong with it here ) who asked me why i talk about illegal weapons all of a sudden , because they thought i brought the subject about illegal weapons out of my ass . 
  i used the auxiliary `` might '' . 
  as far as i know ( i.e. 
  correct me if i am wrong ) , `` might '' is typically used to point that something may or may not occur or be , or may or may have occurred or been . 
  meaning that there is a probability that some event have happened or that there is a probability that it has not , therefore let us be on the safe side and let us not draw any conclusions about the aforementioned event . 
  so my sentence you quoted could have been read as follows : `` the law does not talk about illegal weapons but he does '' or : `` both the law and op talk about illegal weapons . 
  '' showing that in any case , you talked about illegal weapons , and illegal weapons were the subject , and therefore it does not matter whether the law was written with illegal weapons in mind or not . 
  ------------  as far as i know , the terrorists did n't apply for gun licenses in your country , did they ? 
  hi , captain obvious !, 
  though if we consider all possible scenarios , they could have obtained the weapons from someone who has licenses . 
  or from swiss . 
  ( notice the usage of `` * could * '' ) . 
  can you buy ak-47 's in swiss ? 
  if not , would you have asked the same question if the event happened in swiss ? 
  you or the article could also have taken note of the fact that the majority of the gun related crimes in france ( and possibly other eu countries ) are committed using unregistered weapons . 
  so there is more to it than the paris attack , which is barely used as an incentive for this law or others in the same area ( cf `` the loophole which became evident in the aftermath of last year 's terrorist attacks in paris '' which is talked about in the article ) . 
   they claim this is to prevent terrorism terrorism is not the only matter here , merely a motivation to try to figure out ( half-arsed ) measures . 
   but instead of concentrating efforts in tackling the illegal gun problem from outside europe now that i think about it , i am pretty sure that some guns are legal in some countries ( like swiss ) and illegal in others ( like france ) . 
  so perhaps the illegal guns situation is not just about what comes unregistered from outside of europe ? 
   they decided to use it as a way to push an agenda to fuck legal gun owners in the ass . 
  i do n't think there is an agenda specifically designed to `` fuck legal gun owner in the ass '' . 
  since such attitude is being visible in other domain , such as cryptocurrency lately , - or rather money laundering ( hallo switzerland ! ), 
  used as an excuse to control cryptocurrency and block-chains in general , - it is more about fucking every one who is not in power in the ass . 
   it 's typical anti-gunner logic where a bunch of terrorists with illegal guns kill a bunch of people and the way to solve the problem is by making legal guns even more restrictive ( despite the extremely restrictive gun laws in europe as a whole ) . 
  there are pro-gunners who share the same logic . 
  even in france , some people think we should have the right to own guns , as a defense , with some restrictions to avoid e.g. 
  military grade weapons to proliferate , or mentally unstable people to own weapons . 
  you just happen to be an extremist who wants all or nothing . 
   but this law does not deal in any way with illegal guns coming in . 
  why does someone who is against this law need to present arguments for a totally unrelated issue ? 
  the law might not talk about illegal weapons but his comment sure does :  [ it will do absolutely nothing to tackle the problem of illegal guns coming from eastern europe and northern africa .

  * you * just do n't want to argue . 
  we have n't raised the pigs together , so i can infer the following : * * you * do n't know me * * you * do n't know how knowledgeable i am on this subject * * you * do n't know whether or not i support these laws ( whether it is at the eu level or national level ) * * you * do n't know whether or not i believe they will be effective * et cetera all i 'm asking from you is to put forward some arguments . 
  maybe use the system to change it . 
  but you do n't want to . 
  just like any self respecting idiot , you nonchalantly think destroying the eu is the solution to everything . 
   as an european gun owner , this only made me more anti-eu . 
  you bet i will only vote on anti eu parties and also urge other people to do so in my friend and family circle . 
  found the american spy . 
  all joking aside , you could have at least tried to put forward a few arguments as how to fix the issue of illegal guns coming in ( at least for the schengen area ) . 
  for now you just sound like a retard who has fuck all opinions except for `` i want muh freedom of guns so fuck the eu !!! 1 ! 11 !! 1 ! 1 !!!! 1 ! '' . 
  ( not to mention that the eu is kind of like a democracy , where people can try to influence the parliament they elected or are represented by , and make the parliament abrogate or modify a law , so maybe you could try to convince citizens of the eu to pressure the parliament by argumenting with them . 
  but i guess in totalitarian communist european union , everything is set in stone and nothing will ever change .

  i know what sub you come from to ask that question  since i 've read some of the comments there , and since i know the attitudes of some americans on reddit when it comes to french laws on religion , let me try to thoroughly explain the situation ( some of it by memory ) : * history during the french revolution , people were mostly divided into two main groups : the jacobins and the girondins . 
  the girondins thought that the enemies of france and of the revolution were in foreign countries , so they started to wage wars on foreign monarchies , hoping to export values of the revolution along the way ( which eventually lead to the napoleonic empire ) . 
  the jacobins , however , thought that the enemies of the republic were in france . 
  and they were somewhat right as the strongest opposition to the revolution was from the peasants who were the most influenced by the catholic church , which was strongly in favour of the monarchy . 
  so there was obviously a civil war , and thousands of people got guillotined , or drowned , or went through a firing squad , etc. . . , simply for being too close to the church ( or accused of being so ) . 
  this was known as the terror , and some of its instigators , notoriously maximilien robespierre , ended up being guillotined as well , for being `` tyrants '' . 
  some think that napol\u00e9on could have been guillotined at that time too , but he was in corsica when shit went down for the jacobins after the terror . 
  napol\u00e9on , in 1801 , signed a concordat with the catholic church to put an end to the religion motivated terrorist attacks ( ! ), 
  which was formally abrogated in 1905 . 
  so , since the revolution , religion is associated with monarchy , and with the ancien r\u00e9gime , and monarchy is not really fancied in french culture anymore . 
  therefore there is a strong secular culture , and you can not have a discussion about religion without including atheists and their views and feelings in it . 
  not to mention that non-theistic people represent the dominant group in france ( ~ 67 % of the population ) . 
  * laws ( i posted this [ elsewhere a few of days ago ] ( https://np.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/61liw7/donald_trump_printed_out_madeup_300bn_nato/dfg1obf/?context=3 ) ) :  there is no law in france that allows firing someone just for `` wearing religious symbols '' , actually it is illegal to do just that . 
  what you misinterpret is the following :   - religious activities have to be compatible with work days and/or hours , however you can still arrange with your boss taking a day off for a religious holiday before said holiday comes  - religious signs have to be compatible with security measures ; religious signs are not the only things that can be banned for security reasons : necklaces do n't require a jesus cross or a star of david to strangle you if caught in some obstacle ; meaning : you ca n't use your religion to avoid security measures  - employees can not hide their faces if they work in contact with the public : bank , theatre , restaurant , ( private ) hospital , etc. . . ( infringing this may only result in a fine of up to 150 $ )   if someone thinks that they have been unjustly fired , they can still sue the company , and it will up to a court of justice to decide who is in fault . 
  generally speaking , checking for religion compatibility is done before hiring . 
    so no , in france you can not get fired just for that picture of jesus on your desk , or for the scarf on your head . 
  to get fired , you have to use your religion as a way to oppose to the well-functioning of the company ( missing random days , not working at certain hours , disregard for security measures ) . 
    all that said , trying to convert your coworkers to your religion , or threatening to the well-being of your coworkers based on your religion is illegal . 
  to which i 'm gon na add : - some jobs require to have periodical medical visits , and you ca n't use your religion to avoid them . 
  - proselytism , or other religious recruitment , are forbidden in public places . 
  * clothing this seems to be an issue . 
  unlike what some ignorant american said in the thread that motivated you to ask that question , the size of a crucifix is not used to tell whether or not it is considered a religious sign . 
  the size is used to tell whether or not you are allowed to wear it in public : ostentatious signs are forbidden . 
  kippot are not considered ostentatious because , well , there are small and can somewhat appear hidden depending on its colour and the wearer 's hair colour . 
  but a 1 meter diamond encrusted gold crucifix is ostentatious and thus forbidden to be worn in public spaces . 
  same goes for stars of david , muslim crescents , om icons , etc. ... 
  the whole question , which is a ( the ) debate , is : are hijabs , scarfs , or other such clothing religious symbols at all ? 
  should they be banned like that diamond encrusted gold crucifix some seem to fancy ?

  1st law of thermodynamics . 
  for the past 5 or 10 years , there have been changes concerning the parks in france . 
  the municipalities tends to be more ecological : no more pesticides , less mowing , less triming , avoid watering ... 
  the idea is to spend less resources ( work or natural resources ) . 
  this leads to parks being `` rougher '' , more `` natural '' . 
  if you want to see beautiful law , go see `` jardins '' . 
  usually , you need to pay to see them .

  i subscribed to this subreddit to get interesting questions about european countries , to learn about europe . 
  this is an interesting question and i would love to read answers . 
  not really . 
  we are still allowed to protest . 
  some people are just pillaging in my city and i do n't mind if they are obligated to stay at home . 
  there is no torture nor unexpected jail time . 
  the police is doing a good job and they have a big pressure on them . 
  they are currently on strike because of this pressure . 
  in france , marmiton is the most famous , but i prefer `` chef simon '' for the quality of the recipies . 
  it 's available everywhere in france . 
  you just have to go in a darty/boulanger to know the brand http://www.darty.com/nav/recherche?text=de+dietrich&amp;srctype=auto, 
  it 's a french company !?

  there are now two parks . 
  disneyland and walt disney studios . 
  you definitely need two days , one for each . 
  you need two entrances , one for each park . 
  if you plan to go out , the nearby city is not that great ( marne la vall\u00e9e ) . 
  you can take the rer ( train ) to go to paris . 
  it 's 7 $ 50 for a 45min ride to the center of paris . 
  there 's one train every 15 minutes . 
  where in france ? 
  there are tons of micro breweries with good beer in france . 
  most of [ houses in europe are made of rock/concrete blocks/mud , compared to wood in the usa ] ( http://masonrydesign.blogspot.fr/2014/01/european-construction-versus-north.html ) . 
  the thermal inertia of concrete/rock/mud is really high . 
  also , they are designed with small windows . 
  european houses tend to be dark and fresh during summer . 
  note 1 : in the nordic countries , they use wood but summer is never hot . 
  note 2 : new european houses tend to use wood and big windows . 
  note 3 : in the south of europe ( italy , greece ... ) where it 's really hot in summer , we use ac , especially in `` modern '' buildings (  1950 ) that are not designed to be fresh . 
  do n't be silly . 
  in france we all have a really big kitchen with apprentice chefs like in ratatouille and we only eat complex recipes .

  made by an american fighter in france . 
  paris, 
  no , we do n't , it 's just a joke . 
  we see it as a part of france . 
  it 's a joke related to a recent event . 
  in the begining of 2016 , there were elections for the presidents of regions . 
  the new president of region corsica is a separatist . 
  the first thing he said was trolling the gouvernement , saying that [ france is a friendly country to corsica . 
  ] ( http://www.20minutes.fr/societe/1768247-20160118-corse-talamoni-france-pays-ami ) it may be stupid but most people see it as a full part of france only because when there is a map of the weather , corsica is on it . 
  on the other side , dom/tom are not on this map and are often forgotten by people . 
  i was on vacation on one of these islands and people from the `` main '' part of france were saying `` in france '' when speaking about were they live , even if they were actually in france . 
  outdoor markets are unusual for an american . 
  once or twice a week , in cities , mobile shops are all going on a place . 
  the day of the week depends of the city . 
  you can found really good food there , but it 's expensive . 
  you can go there just to take some pictures and for the smell . 
  country-side markets are the best because you can find local food producers . 
  nice try salah abdeslam . 
  there are tasty food that you will never find in the us : old cheese that stinks ( blue cheese , raw milk camembert , mimolette extra vieille ... ) . 
  be careful where to buy it . 
  in supermarkets , there are tons of tasteless cheese . 
  in some big supermarkets , there are good cheeses . 
  blue cheese should be `` roquefort '' and can be eaten with butter or pear , because the taste is very strong . 
  camembert should be `` camembert de normandie '' and not `` camembert fabriqu\u00e9 en normandie '' . 
  mimolette should be `` extra vieille '' . 
  comt\u00e9 should be old , ex 24 months old . 
  of course you need baguette ( `` tradition '' ) and wine to go with it . 
  i have seen a french flag tis week , it was half mast all the week . 
  these restaurants may be in touristic places so they can be jerks . 
  they ca n't refuse you free water and bread . 
  sometimes they try to trick you , especially if you are a foreigner , or in expensive restaurants . 
  they ask you if you want still of flat water , if you do n't say `` no bottle , tap water '' they bring you a bottle . 
  select any three places and stay there for 1 week and a half . 
  do some activities like hiking , kayak , geocaching , meet the people , go to the supermarket , buy quality food , invite your neighbours for a brunch/ap \u00e9ro / tea time ... people always want to see too much in europe and as a result they see nothing of the actual europe . 
  they see relics like the chateau de versailles or the parthenon , but that 's not how we live . 
  europe is `` buraczki z chrzanem '' , `` turkish coffee in greece '' , `` kayak in the verdon gorge '' , `` a quizz game in a pub in england '' , `` fireworks in copenhagen december the 31th '' , etc. 
  beautiful scenery + historical site = dordogne ( france ) . 
  it 's a well known place for prehistoric relics . 
  sarlat is a medieval city . 
  also : foie-gras , montbazillac wine ... 
  it 's also a great place for hitchhiking and kayak .

  just avoid the `` diagonale du vide '' http://fr.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/diagonale_du_vide,

  it is pretty awesome . 
  it is indeed . 
  this particular one is rabbi jacob where he plays an antisemitic ceo that has to impersonate a rabbi to hide from criminals looking for him .

  ca n't we just keep giving electronic handjobs to the heroes of the day and not dwell on whether the legion of honour is given to show business people or not or if it has been abused in the 1880 / is still being abused today ? 
  ca n't we just stop seeing the negative part of everything ? 
  that 's really something i hate in french people , in any positive event we always have to scratch the surface to see if there is any little negative aspect that we could promote instead . 
  we know the legion is honour is often abused , let 's just rejoice that this time it is 100 % deserved and that 's all . 
  not everyone wants to go on tv and have their name in the medias .

  knights were nobility , they paid for their own upkeep . 
  we did not colonize anyone , we were merely `` spreading civilization '' . 
  more seriously i never think about it . 
  in one hand i think it was wrong on many levels to do it . 
  on the other hand i am not sure france would have the position it has today if it had not done this . 
  i also think it has to be put back in the context of the time , they did see the natives as barbarians in dire need of our shiny civilization . 
  we now know that it was terribly wrong but at the time it was not really seen this way . 
  i feel no shame or pride towards it . 
  these are events of the past and i had no influence on them whatsoever . 
  it somehow manages to be more retarded than the two french degenerates ' versions . 
  come on , it is clearly an abuse of the laws in question . 
  they sink their own ships on purpose . 
  cycling culture in france is summed as such : `` alcoholics cheering junkies on bikes . '', 
  in calais some of the locals hunt and mug the migrants to steal them their money . 
  they know the migrants wo n't ever turn to the police so there is no risk at all . 
  i know a guy in calais who has racist friends who do that from time to time when they need some money . 
  they drive around with baseball bats and when they spot one or two isolated migrants they beat them up and take all the money they have on them . 
  the hospitals in calais are full of migrants that have been injured this way . 
  as much as i dislike the migrants i just want them either given refugee status if they truly are in deadly danger in their country or sent back to their countries if they are n't but exploiting them is just scummy .

  you have to be a licensed hunter or shooter and fill some conditions but having a legal firearm in france is nothing impossible . 
  we do n't have much of a gun culture though so the huge majority people are not interested enough to do the paperwork and fill the requirements so we do n't have many people with firearms in the cities . 
  in rural france though hunting weapons are pretty common .

  excerpts :  no one can assert today that the path of war will be shorter than that of the inspections . 
  no one can claim either that it might lead to a safer , more just and more stable world . 
  for war is always the sanction of failure . 
  would this be our sole recourse in the face of the many challenges at this time ?

  but now he 's completely changed !, 
  he speaks slowly , as if he thinks that 's what makes him look presidential , solemn and serious . 
  the ( rare ) politicians who support him ( at this stage : others might join depending how well he does from now on ) are all very old . 
  imo he lost the appeal he had and his attitude no longer matches the narrative he 's selling . 
  i do n't get it . 
  he now seems young and not prepared enough , as oposed to fresh , dynamic and modern . 
  he says he 's a `` progressive '' : economically and socially liberal . 
  but , as i said , he still has n't explained what his program is ( this summer he was saying that he would reveal what his concrete propositions are once the decision to go or not was made : well , now we 're there and still nothing ) . 
  so , as you have understood , i do n't like the guy and i agree : it 's all a facade .

  investigations are ongoing at the moment , we do n't know what caused it . 
  - ** parents wanting to name their newborn baby `` mohamed merah '' may have to find another idea ** . 
  mohamed merah is the name of a terrorist who killed 3 soldiers , a jewish teacher and 3 young jewish children in 2012 in toulouse . 
  this brings interesting questions : mohamed is a popular name for muslim families , it 's not their fault if their last name is the same as his , but for the good of the child is it a smart idea ? 
  if you are looking for a nice movie to watch , then [ le pr\u00e9nom ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqjh8gorypq ) is really good ( do n't read too much about it , otherwise there 's no point , trust me it 's good , although this teaser is n't ) . 
  you 'll be happy to learn that he was released !, 
  i see , i did misinterpret . 
  yes , complex issue , i know the law in france is different but it 's such a complicated topic that i could n't even explain how it exactly works ... 
  the last one is quite surprising to me . 
  i would never expect french catholic leaders to campaign for this . 
   a fireman was caught starting fires in sicilly . 
  makes sense actually , it 's not an isolated case ( pyromaniacs becoming firemen to satisfy their fascination ) . 
  is this interpretated as a purely internal thing , or is it also partly addressed to trump ? 
  france : - ** we 're currently 3rd in the london athletics world championships !, 
  ** behind the usa and kenya . 
  ( we were 10th yesterday , but got 2 more gold medals yesterday evening - decathlon - and today -50 km walk . 
  we had another gold earlier this week -800 m - and a bronze medal ) . 
  not bad . 
  and we may get another one this evening , maybe ? 
  congratulations to the other european nations currently ranking at the top of the medal table : poland ( 4rth ) , great britain ( 5th ) , germany ( 10th ) ... and all the others . 
  and thanks london , it was great to watch once again , like five years ago , and last month for the para athletics ( first time i watched extensively and it was great as well ) . 
  top notch audience and mascot  - ** a man ploughed into 6 soldiers in a town near paris ** . 
  3 of them were seriously injured ( non lethal injuries ) . 
  the suspect was caught on the highway and is still being treated in the hospital because he was shot 5 times ( including in his spine ) , so he has not been interrogated yet . 
  he is an algerian citizen , living legally in france , who was not known by the intelligence services ( not identified as a potential radical islamist or with connections to jihadists ) and he did n't have any criminal record . 
  but his action seemed deliberate and the case is being treated as terrorism . 
  ( this led to , yet again , a small debate about whether the `` sentinelle '' operation - soldiers being stationed near touristic monuments and religious sites or schools - is useful or not - besides reassuring the general public ) . 
  - ** more fires ** . 
  and a young man confessed 8 of the 16 fires he was accused of , that happened earlier this summer . 
  - ** the contaminated eggs have made their way to france this week ** . 
  ( we were n't affected as of last week ) . 
  - ** airbnb in the spotlight ** . 
  for being a shitty company ... you know the deal . 
  and also similar articles about another start-up : one that exploits their cyclist employees who deliver meals . 
  - the president , government and mps are on holiday . 
  ( next week , i may have to report on a controversy related to islam , burkinis , halal food , women 's rights ... this is usually what editorialists and journalists feed us in the summer when they have nothing to talk about politically . 
  there have been a few attempts this summer but nothing juicy enough to generate enough national outrage and intense debates . 
  this is all too quiet . 
  it 's not normal ) . 
  i think that 's all . 
  france : - ** actress jeanne moreau died at 89 ** . 
  [ she ] ( https://www.rts.ch/2014/04/22/14/59/5791411.image ) worked with [ louis malle ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icjw9hxxoxa ) , fran\u00e7ois truffaut , jacques demy , michelangelo antonioni , luis bunuel , orson welles ... - ** neymar signed with psg ** . 
  and it was on the news all week !!!, 
  stop it !, 
  i do n't give a ... !, 
  - ** paris will host the olympic games in 2024 ** . 
  hurray !, 
  we won because we were the only contenders ( with los angeles ) . 
  well it 's not `` official '' yet but that 's it . 
  the corruption can begin/continue . 
  - ** high temperatures and many fires ** . 
  france politics : - ** the chief of staff of the armed forces , general de villiers , quit ** . 
  he complained about the cuts in the defense budget in front of the ( closed-door ) commission of the national assembly . 
  his remarks were leaked to the press ( by some mps i assume . 
  which ones ? 
  from the opposition i assume ) . 
  he was ` put in his place ' by emmanuel macron on the 13th of july ( right before the military parade of bastille day ) who said `` i 'm your boss , you should n't express yourself publicly about this '' . 
  this was not received well : many military members felt it was a public humiliation of their boss . 
  as a result , general de villiers resigned this week and was replaced . 
  this controversy is probably the biggest macron has had to face so far , but it was not as big as what i had imagined , we talked about it for two days and that 's it . 
  - ** the government is making cuts in the housing benefits , as well as in the budget of the secretary of state for the equality between women and men ** . 
  the housing benefits concern lower-class students and families . 
  they will lose 5 euros per month . 
  the cuts will allegedly serve to fund the building of new low-price housing . 
  the secretary of state in charge of the equality between men and women will have its budget decreased by 25/27 % . 
  it funds plenty of associations helping victims of sexual discriminations and/or violence . 
  ( this news leaked in the press and the secretary of state called it `` fake news '' , but apparently the journalists were right ) . 
  ( prior to that , the government had also announced cuts in the education & research as well as in the justice budgets ) . 
  - ** the unions are worried about the labour reform ** . 
  of course the most left-leaning trade unions had already been vocal about the new labour reform the government worked on in the national assembly this month . 
  but now even the most `` macron-friendly '' ones are beginning to express criticism . 
  the bill will return to the assembly in late august/early september ( where it will pass since there is no opposition due to macron 's party extra-large majority ) . 
  so there will be social protests in the streets , but how big will they be and how strongly will the government ( its interior ministry ) react ? 
  too early to tell . 
  - ** jean-luc m\u00e9lenchon , leader of the ` far-left ' party `` fi '' , is suspected of having hired fake european assistants ** . 
  this is linked to the case about marine le pen and her national front party illegal meps assistants . 
  they hired fake parliamentary assistants who were supposed to be working in brussels but who were in fact working in paris , for the party ( including for instance marine le pen 's bodyguard ) . 
  after this was revealed , a national front mep said `` hey but we 're not the only ones doing it , why are you targeting only us ?? '', 
  and gave informations about the centrist party `` modem '' ( a macron ally ; and macron had to fire 3 of his newly hired ministers because of it : they were members of this modem party ) .

  it 's not a law , it 's an `` arr\u00eat\u00e9 municipal '' , ie an unilateral decision by the mayor . 
  it can be contested but the process takes a while and i 'm not very familiar with it . 
  this bullshit is extremely embarrassing . 
  you can discuss seismic codes and wonder why more is n't done to limit the damage . 
  i 'd hate to be one of those police officers right now . 
  if you ca n't detect sarcasm this thick there is n't much that can be done for you . 
  germany was planning on colonizing poland 80 years ago . 
  that 's called track cycling . 
  madagascar is a chinese colony , they wo n't let us . 
  good point . 
  meh , cannes beaches suck anyway . 
  a friend took [ this picture ] ( http://imgur.com/qcrfxkv ) at a hotel in morocco earlier this year , they cite `` hygiene reasons '' . 
  not exactly sure what those are , but there you go . 
   that 's why attacking religions is really counterproductive because it does n't address the core issue . 
  indeed , let 's attack poor people instead !, 
  in the end it boils down to british sovereingty though , because there 's no reason to believe that british politicians are less likely to allow immigrants in the uk . 
  it was tony blair after all who decided not to exercise the uk 's right to maintain immigration control after the polish accession in 2003 , and the huge pakistani population in the uk sure as hell was n't imposed by the eu . 
  school-aged girls do n't wear burkas anyway . 
  oh absolutely , that 's what i 'm trying to say . 
  it 's a vote about values , there 's no objectively right or wrong . 
   but if they think that maybe they could end up 40 to a room in a disused school in bulgaria , fighting for a slice of bread , they wo n't see this european dream with the same eyes any more , and stay home . 
  this is extremely naive and will definitely prove to be ineffective . 
  the eu is wasting precious political capital on this very divisive and ultimately pointless redistribution nonsense instead of working towards more practical solutions such as refugee processing centers abroad and a strong european border agency . 
  it 's very disappointing . 
   not really . 
  as a matter of fact i have not even talked about my ideas on trade so you are just projecting . 
  you 're saying that having a trade deficit is losing money . 
  it 's the same rhetoric trump uses when he talks about mexico and funding his wall . 
   why do they lose money trading with germany ? 
  because his understanding of international trade is stuck in 17th century mercantilism . 
  there are huge fiscal transfers from london into scotland . 
  i was talking about brexit and its consequences to my uncle yesterday ( well educated conservative who voted leave ) . 
  at some point i tried to sum up his position as `` having the freedom to make your own mistakes '' and he agreed with it . 
  there was nowhere to go from there . 
  you wo n't convince the leave crowd with numbers , they value `` british sovereignty '' above all else . 
  nah i 'm pretty sure it was the roma people . 
   you can say that again . 
  our retards of extreme right parties would dial back the eu so much it would damage belgium on all levels . 
  belgium is tired of being ruled by brussels instead of brussels !, 
  this is why we fucked our colonies up and made sure they never became more relevant than us . 
  new tourists are n't taking any chances , hence the tanks . 
  it 's really great to see russia providing for the safety of their citizens abroad . 
  did a frenchman steal your girl or something ? 
  that 's a lot of unwarranted aggression . 
  what 's the difference ? 
  prior to the vote , farage said he would work towards another referendum if remain won by a small margin . 
  i 'm not getting into this argument again , just reminding you that until article 50 is actually invoked , people can still talk about it and try to sway their representatives . 
   then the french would in affect be supporting the spread of islam , which i find problematic to say the least . 
  it 's unfortunate , but if you ca n't suppress an ideology your best bet is attempting to control it . 
   but there was a popular referendum . 
   the eu 's efficient bureaucracy you might be the first and only brit to ever put these worlds together . 
  which is why there are no racial tensions at all in the us . 
   but we will make them love us ... by force !!, 
  did n't you guys try that a century ago ? 
  i think that 's a very british thing , actually . 
   hm ... why is sweden so small ?

  are n't brothels legal in germany ? 
  maybe you guys should unite with moldova and call yourselves moldova instead . 
  that paris still exists . 
  you do n't see buses burning around the jardin du luxembourg , bastille or palais-royal . 
  or most places really . 
  what are you proposing ? 
  nobody really believes poland is a dictatorship . 
  hyperbole is how you draw attention to issues and prevent the hyperbole from becoming reality . 
  it 's not my fault that 's for sure . 
   what characterizes a `` right '' and a `` left '' economical standpoint then ? 
  the amount of state intervention in the economy . 
  funny how internet allows us to engage with people all around the world , yet some still prefer to build strawmen and argue with them instead . 
  [ you convinced me . 
   how the hell that happened ? 
  on moment you had erdogan panicking and seeking asylum all over europe afaik we have no concrete evidence of this , just some twitter rumormongering . 
  systematic dismantling of opposition media , strong suspicions of election rigging ... 
  yes , very democratic . 
  erdogan has co-opted turkey 's political institutions and is creating a new caliphate , the army is supposed to be the secular counter-power that prevents this exact scenario from happening . 
  try reading up on recent turkish history . 
  looks like the government should pull through . 
  tfw you come back from your week-end trip and the military is sitting at your desk, 
  i really would n't mind if we just went back to making fun of the brexit situation . 
  i 'm not saying we should take everyone in . 
  i 'm saying that shaming them for refusing to fight on the side of some brutal extremists against other groups of brutal extremists is ridiculous . 
  it 's just a way of justifying your anti-refugee stance and feeling better about yourself . 
  the reality is a lot harsher . 
  europe is at odds with the refugees , what we want and what they want are in contradiction , it 's not our fault nor theirs , and it sucks . 
  i live in paris and i do n't feel what you 're describing at all . 
  ok let 's imagine for a second that you 're a syrian male of fighting age . 
  what do you do ? 
  do you join assad ? 
  al-qaeda ? 
  isis ? 
  none of those causes are worth dying for . 
  if i were one of them i would get the fuck out as well . 
  reminder that brexit was orchestrated by the cartographer lobby . 
   implement new regulations when we fax them to you the eu is imposing fax on its members ? 
  i want out . 
  i just res tagged you so that in the future i wo n't waste my time reading your messages . 
  av has flaws but it 's definitely more representative of the voter 's views than fptp . 
  then perhaps they should 've voted for the av referendum .

  i go on a 1 minute rant about useless his story is , how he 's making us lose his time and our time with pointless stories when he could be talking about friggin airbus and friggin planes which are nice things with tons of interesting facts and technical points that would have been interesting for us engineers to be . 
  i still get mad thinking about it . 
  well we just caught one guy that had 5 aks , 1 kilo of explosives , 100 grams of tatp ... oh they 've all been to syria of course but they 're running free around france and europe . 
  why ? 
  do n't ask me ... 
   which is not permitted under international law . '', 
  that 's false . 
  http://m.20minutes.fr/societe/1760211-20160105-decheance-nationalite-si-souhaite-france-pourrait-creer-apatrides  remove it from only dual-citizenship people if you are naturalised , you can have it stripped for you if you 've been french for 10 years of less . 
   france has n't ratified it thank you . 
    practically , most terrorists will not have a second citizenship if they have a french citizenship . 
  and that 's a bad thing because ? 
  help me out here man . 
   but i would n't call our beaches shitty . 
  costinesti is crappy and crowded , eforie nord was crowded and decrepit with shortening beaches ( they have to bring in sand because the sea was eroding them ) , i guess mamaia 's okayish . 
  and then you have the [ sea algaes ] ( http://www.digi24.ro/stiri/digi24/actualitate/social/video+litoralul+romanesc+invadat+de+alge ) and you hope they remove them ... they never find the time to . 
  they 'd friggin pound music on the beaches instead of letting you relax and the friggin smell of kebabs . 
   naturally , any country can do what it wants , but countries that want to be part of the community ca n't go around making stateless citizens . 
  that 's not a thing ...  there are no precedents and common sense is not a valid principle of international law . 
  we removed the french citizenship for a couple of nazis back in the day . 
   nothing can compel another country to grant citizenship to an individual it considers an alien . 
  i 'm saying that if a person had both citizenship a and b and country a strips him of it , the person will still have citizenship b. 
   possibly of course , though if they were as subversive and effective as some would claim you would expect to see thousands of would be terrorists europe has sent a couple of thousand .

   yeah , exactly , that would never have worked hence the pipe dream . 
  why ? 
   i 'm glad they decided against implementing it . 
  well yeah , but now the right and extreme right can shit on muslims all day long . 
  what a better situation ... 
  they did n't want to implement it because it was a lefting govt and it would have looked weird for them .

   that 's a pretty bold statement , care to back it up with some international law or customary precedent ? 
  that a country can not refuse it 's own citizens ? 
  it 's common sense and definition of citizenship . 
   well they certainly did n't learn it in a school in pakistan did they in mosques from saudi arabia maybe ?

   all the motivations about welfare , or healthcare , or right to vote , etc. . . are already existing and can be stripped in justice . 
  sauce ? 
  right of vote yeah , but other rights i 'm not sure . 
   there was a logical `` we need to do something , anything '' popular reaction after the attacks . 
  what will happen now is that people will start shitting on the muslim population . 
  wait come election time ... 
  instead of penalising the terrorists , we 'll get to hear 100 more speeches on islam that will make the muslim population feels less of a part of society . 
  awesome ... cooler heads amirite ? 
   its our mess , not theirs .

   if you just want to swim in that murky water than often is way too cold ? 
   they could n't take it away from abdelsalam the project was to remove the citizenship even if they have only french . 
  second , there is nothing compelling a country taking a convicted terrorist from another country even if the second country stripped the citizenship of the terrorist . 
  in your example you were talking about pakistan . 
  if the guy is a pakistani citizen then pakistan has to take him . 
  does n't matter where he lived all his life . 
  also , australia can find countries to store their refugees , europe too would manage to find a country for some terries after they get out of jail ( due to old age ) . 
  we simply lack political will . 
   beaches ... 
  compared to the med , they 're pretty shit . 
  also there 're few opportunities in terms of urban tourism . 
   with a global competition for jobs , the whole premise of social democracy is over . 
  it 's not like you can compete for jobs in france or the us . 
  the reality is that those that growing in the polls , are because they talk about jobs and job security . 
  trump and his wall , merkel and her job security in germany , le pen in france . 
  why the left is suffering , the right is n't faring much better ... 
   `` hey pakistan , we stripped this guy of french citizenship because he 's a convicted terrorist , please take him back . 
  why ? 
  the abdeslam 's were 100 % french . 
  ask anyone and they 'll tell you that . 
  ask them how long the abdeslam 's lived in france : you 'll get the answer : 0 years . 
  salah was born in brussels . 
  but everyone agrees they 're french .

   this also explains the unusual distribution of the family name i did n't know that website , seems pretty cool .

  it has everything to do about race and racism . 
  there 's a surprising ^ / s correlation between anti-islam and white nationalism/supremacism . 
  international islamic terrorism is a matter of historical circumstances , not a matter of religious tenets . 
  fair enough . 
  i 'm lgbt myself but could see how it comes off as you say . 
  i 'm not the one that made it about muslims though . 
  my initial point was pointing out the atrocities committed , and a bunch of people went and tell me `` oh no they 're not really nazis , just muslims '' . 
  whether or not gay people were the target , i would have argued with these people . 
  that being said , i must point out that / r/lgbt and / r/ainbow are indeed left-leaning , but that calling them `` a very select bunch of salty , easily-offended , extreme leftists who are more hostile towards conservative gays than what conservatives are to gay people '' does n't particularly make me give more credence to your point . 
  i 'm left-leaning myself . 
  i know that some people vote against their class interests . 
  some factory workers vote for capitalists . 
  some women vote for conservatives that want to control their body . 
  some lgbt people vote for conservatives that want to deny them equality , or dispute the notion of what equality consists of itself . 
  i 'll fight for lgbt rights for ourselves , whatever our political convictions , despite conservative lgbt people working against that . 
  i do n't care if you find it condescending or patronizing .

  western europe was an underdeveloped unstable bigoted shithole by today 's standards a hundred years ago . 
  western europe is n't a beacon of progressiveness . 
  people and minorities had to fight like hell to get the recognition they have today , and there 's still work . 
  this is n't about saying `` we 're as bad as them '' , because we 're not , but we certainly have no claim to cultural superiority just because we were lucky enough to colonize and rough up the entire world and take a small lead into being not barbaric . 
  they 'll catch up , eventually . 
  just help them get there instead of holding them back . 
  i think they 're not and know exactly what they 're saying . 
  right back at you . 
  experts say that it is n't islam that radicalizes people to go fight for isis but people already on a radicalization path , often through petty crime , that use islam and isis as an outlet . 
  your problem is n't islam , it 's unemployment and he lack of future prospect that makes people join the nearest death cult . 
  if it was n't isis , it would be something else and you could n't blame islam anymore , so do n't blame it in the first place . 
  calling for `` bash the fash '' being a bannable offense , i 'm sure this will be moderated . 
  anytime now . 
  nah , nazi/fascist apologists always gang up on you when you use either word . 
  `` you ca n't use the word here because it is n't perfectly 100 % absolutely historically accurate , you 're devaluating the meaning of the words , that 's helping real nazis/fascists you vile leftists !!! '', 
  be careful there , using that word fascist , you 're devaluating it 's meaning . 
  be careful there , you 're devaluating the meaning of the word by calling people nazis . 
  wow , never saw that video .

  as long as you 're consistent and disapprove of every other religion in the same manner , i 'll call you ignorant and intolerant instead of racist . 
  there were special forces operative on grounds , and while gaddafi lost , calling the situation a victory is a far reach . 
  anything can be turned into an ideology . 
  there are people who want christian or jewish theocracies . 
  limiting it to islam is what tends to distinguish racists .

  ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/0c/25/4d/0c254d5883792d66dc28a27393db45d7.jpg ) the company that linked marseilles and corsica was going bankrupt as far as i know , but given this is about connecting two french territories it 's reasonable to expect france to finance it . 
  transportation is a public services , it does n't have to be profitable , though it needs to be well managed so change was needed . 
  the shipyard was owned by a south korean parent company that did go bankrupt despite the shipyard being profitable in itself . 
  the shipyard is a strategic interest for france as it 's one of the few on the atlantic facade and can build military ships , but it was sold to an italian company . 
  france should have been able to say `` hey , we need that '' . 
  it could n't because forbidden by eu free-market and no french company was interested ( or one was but did n't get the deal , i do n't remember ) . 
  but well , you know , [ the greater good ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/0c/25/4d/0c254d5883792d66dc28a27393db45d7.jpg ) . 
  you need to stop that faith thing . 
  oh yeah , i do agree that this article is n't about muslims , and i do agree that people who cherry-pick bits they like and do n't like in their faith should n't be labeled as practitioners . 
  it 's other people that made it about muslims , which is part of the problem and reasoning for my accusations . 
  so you 're not a pedantic , i 'm glad we cleared that up . 
  have a good day . 
  fair enough , i can accept that instead of people basically telling me i 'm being unfair to nazis . 
  there two things . 
  the immediate threat gay people face there , being rounded up into camps for torture and death . 
  and the fact that this kind of attitude is reminiscent of past ones and can not be tolerated . 
  it 's important to remember it happened before , we ca n't pretend it 's something new and be cautiously worried . 
  we ought to be horrified and angered precisely because we know where that comes from . 
  so much for schulz/macron will change the eu . 
  i would n't have said communist yeah , because is is n't what you ostensibly disapprove of , but i could have said stalinist yeah , as less accurate is it is . 
  or bolshevik , given from what i understand they 're the ones that perverted communism in russia ( knowledgeable anarchist passerby , feel free to correct me ) . 
  but i called them nazis . 
  and it upset people . 
  it upset you . 
  so you know , i 'm just wondering , are you pedantic , are you a nazi , or are you a pedantic nazi ? 
  nice rant , but that does n't address the question . 
  the eu is fine with baling capitalists and forcing liberalism on every country , but ca n't even allow one country to be socialist ? 
  i 'm not even talking about which is better between socialism and liberalism here , just that we could allow each the same liberty , no ? 
  liberalism , the supposed ideology of `` freedom '' , does n't allow a socialist country to implement it 's policies ? 
  liberalism is liquid and flexible and should be able to absorb that easily , no ? 
  what 's the problem ? 
  `` let me make a connection between two things then tell you they are n't connected . '', 
  history as a tool to not commit the same mistakes and catch the signs early on and all that . 
   some similarities smh . 
  i 'm not going to support gay neo-nazis , i 'm going to support gay people . 
  i do n't care about the fact that they 're neo-nazis when i 'm defending their rights as gay people . 
  a better example you could have had is if there was an organization whose explicit purpose was to defend and evolve gay rights within the neo-nazi movement . 
  i would n't support that , no , i would tell those people i 'm going to support their rights in society in general , not in their particular organization . 
  now if you think that makes me an hypocrite , you would be wrong . 
  islam and neo-nazism , muslims and neo-nazis are n't equivalent . 
  islam is a patriarchal oppressive structure that manifests itself in a non-homogeneous way around the world . 
  it 's a structure that can evolve under progressive pressure to abandon its oppressive tendencies and focus on the faith . 
  muslims come in all shape and form and like people of any other faith , or absence of faith , can support or denounce these oppressive tendencies . 
  neo-nazism is a hateful , discriminatory , genocidal ideology . 
  it 's at it 's core and you ca n't pressure it to become nice . 
  neo-nazis are the incarnation of that hateful , discriminatory , genocidal ideology . 
  there are n't nice neo-nazis that want to live in peace with other people . 
  i can support gay people 's efforts to change their religious superstructure . 
  i ca n't support nazis efforts to change their party/organization attitude toward gay people .

  i 'm not for melenchon , his programm is too naive for me . 
  do n't start lecturing me about things you do n't know . 
  so , really , and pretty ironically , it 's your own bias talking ... who would have thought ? 
  i 'm just saying that trusting this particular poll that says macron won is somewhat dishonest/wrong . 
  when i read international news , they always support macron/says he 's popular , etc , but not really . 
  rip my inbox . 
  happened for two messages too, 
  zut, 
  and he won the election . 
  why do everyone keep coming back to this 3 millions ? 
  that 's how the us system works , not a new thing . 
  if anything , how the systems works is something that should have been factored in ( maybe it was ) , and that 's another argument saying the polls are shit if they really did n't consider that . 
  it 's not a real defence . 
  he won , they said he would n't , they were wrong , period . 
  1157 person is n't `` thousands '' . 
  also , if they choose what crowds they will select the people in , it 's pretty easy . 
  saying this is `` conspiracy shit '' is pretty naive and clogs the debate , / u/warff _ concern are pretty valid , especially since , again , he/she did n't say it was complete bollocks , but pointed out factors that could sway it ... gee , the low number of people interrogated already says this poll is shit to me . 
  that elabe poll , for bfmtv , had 1157 voters . 
  it was from `` telespectateurs '' , so bfmtv watchers ? 
  the tf1 one had way more people voting , and since everyone was watching , it was n't the usual tf1 crowd ( bfmtv ca n't say that ) . 
  of cpurse , people coupd just have decided to brigade this shit , but anyhow , not really more untrustworthy than the elabe one ... ( both are bad , really ) i also do n't get the trumpland attack ? 
  i mean , the media all said he would lose , and he won ... 
  were n't the media polls using `` statisitical method '' ? 
  if anything , it shows that thoses `` scientific '' polls are bullshit . 
  also , remember when the `` fake news '' was a thing used by the left to attack breibart & cies ? 
  trump just hijacked it and the left stopped using it ... saying that he has an hardon is bs too , so what , we ca n't criticize media reporting ? 
  what are you saying ? 
  he/she did n't support anyone , he just gathered some polls because he/she was asked to . 
  the fact that the poll have very different results shows that there are bias , one way or the other ... 
  biased for , biased against , whatever ... and well , he/she was n't saying `` thoses particular poll are biased and wrong '' , but more `` polls in general are biased so beware '', 
  do you wish for plan b : '' we drop our pants and open the buttcheeks ? '', 
  of course it 's going to be bad like that , that 's the point of threats ... 
  then when do you stop ? 
  if in a city , one district is chinese and the others vietnamese , should they be independent ? 
  culture and being proud of your history is n't everything . 
  especially in europe , where everything has a long history ... look up the term `` balkanization '' , it 's a big question . 
  poe 's law , then . 
  normally , we have clues like body movement , tone , and facial expression to guess , but not on the internet . 
  personally , i thought you were n't dead on serious about it , but i did n't see the tongue in cheek part eitheir . 
  so no , not `` clearly '' ( and it 's strange to say that about your own comment , do n't you think ? ), 
  i think the irony is that you think saying one gender is wiser than the other is n't sexist . 
  but there are basically totally the same thing , right ? 
  haha , no, 
  verizon , now the official internet provider mondially, 
  quite the opposite , once we get to others planets , or even just rotating habitats in our own solar system , independence movements willpop up everywhere ... 
  the population keep increasing , and really , looking at our recent history , i do n't see the unifcation tendency . 
  between decolonisation and the fall of the urss , conflicts like yougoslavia , and even before that , empire like austria hungary and the ottomans blowing up , i see quite the opposite . 
  taking your wish for reality , mate . 
  je comprends que c'est l'original , mais ca reste bizarre . 
  it looks , uh ... `` special '' . 
  what are you refering to ? 
  who was invited on a talkshow for a nazi salute ? 
  i 'm interested in seeing that , link please . 
  being ignored ? 
  we see people even ignoring other people in danger sometimes , by the bystander effect , here , he 's not even agressing someone , he 's just making a sign . 
  frankly , i personally would have just walked past, 
  i laughed, 
  we were seriously thinking about putting a baguette on our flag . 
  they increased it a bit here not so long ago . 
  huge uproar , even for french standard . 
  i say that the uk is n't part of the glorious top category as they are on the line . 
  deal ? 
  italy 's and france 's are n't that good . 
  until the king is overthrown for an emperor . 
  imagine the smurfs if they all were french people parodies . 
  yes !, 
  it seems.it 's supposed to be a fleur de lys , but it 's really three lines . 
  haha , this exactly what i meant . 
  you do n't know anything about ww1 , yet you still talk shit . 
  you using the mutinies of all things proves that you do n't know your history . 
  this thread is a perfect example of outrage culture . 
  it 's okay for you guys to bash france all over this thread for something that happened 32 years ago , and make alternative history where you `` saved '' france in both ww1 and ww2 ( right , no french soldiers in thoses trenches ) you 're probably so far up your own asses that you do n't see how that 's insulting too , but hey , you have the moral highground on your high horse , go ahead . 
  also , you need to understand what gratitude is . 
  that your grandpa died to help my great grandpa does n't mean i have to bend over to you . 
  if anything , your grandpa did something for me ( decades before i was even born ) , and you did n't . 
  i do n't know who he is , but one thing is sure , whatever gratitude i have for him does n't extend to you . 
  get your head out of your ass . 
  what did new zealand do in ww1 beside getting killed en masse by the ottomans on the beaches of galipoli ? 
  you did n't save our asses at all as for ww2 , true , france got rekt , like all the countries who did n't have an sea or or an ocean between them and the nazis , or are the ussr . 
  `` saving our asses '' while the nazis were getting steamrolled on the eastern front ? 
   your state sponsored terrorism programme was there more than one attack ? 
  ( honest question ) , because it 's not a programme then . 
  beside , despite all the outrage in this thread , calling secret service actions terrorism is still pushing the definition , imho . 
  feel free to downvote so you can have the highground . 
   i 'm not even saying it was justified ( i did n't touch that subject ) i know . 
  i do too . 
   only that it does n't fit the definition of terrorism , not every criminal act that involves a bomb is terrorism . 
  yup , but you have to expain everything , otherwise , people will start to get outraged about stuff you `` implied '', 
   government would publicly kill you for following your conscience . 
  that 's wrong . 
  you 're messing the intents and the results . 
  killing them was n't the objective of the mission , it was to prevent them from going in the test zone by sinking the ship.the guy who died , did because he went back to get his material after the first bomb blew up . 
  if killing them was the goal , then they would have blown the 2 bombs at the same time , at least . 
  and there are plenty of others options available . 
  i would also say that `` publicly '' is wrong . 
  it only ended being public because they got caught . 
   are you kidding that this was n't terrorism ? 
  like you diagnosed it yourself , it 's semantics , and we are talking definitions . 
  no one ( at least , me and / u/atred ) is saying what they did was justified or that it was n't bad . 
  making judgement about an entire country from comments on the internet , uh ?

  one says , `` this is old , and therefore good . '', 
  and one says , '' this is new , and therefore better . '' - the fact that an econoical/political/philosophical idea/strategy is new or old is n't , and should n't be an argument * per se * , what matter is if this idea/strategy is adapted to the situation to get the wanted result . 
  saying for exemple `` fillon 's strategy is from the 80s '' ( like macron and some journals say ) is empty and annoying if you do n't explain why it is n't suited to the current situation . 
  for exemple it did n't stop shr\u00f6der from applying a similar strategy and get the wanted results . 
   left - or right-leaning , however , tends to be more cultural . 
  it 's a world vision , resulting from a set of values usually acquired within one 's own family or peer circle . 
  arguably the conservatism/progressism position is also acquired that way . 
   it may be called `` les republicains '' but most of the french right-wing politicians would fit quite nicely in the us democrat party , often at the left mind you . 
  completely agree , left/right is n't really a doctrine and is relative to the local spectrum and change depending of the place and time . 
   it 's the result of two judgments : is it the state that drives society , or the other way around ? 
   at the left , the state leads society ( top-down vision , wherin usually politics  economics ) ; whereas at the right , society drives itself and the state is here to help or get out of the way ( bottom-up vision , usually economics  politics ) . 
  you 're basically associating liberalism with right-wing and statism with left-wing , but i really do n't think that is an accurate association , be it currently ( the fn is statist , and some parts of the far-left are anarchists ) or historically ( with the monarchy , the state building the country , the statist `` leftist '' revolution , the interventionism of de gaulle ... ) it does n't makes much sense . 
   in this sense , macron 's political offer is progressive in that it fits into a bottom-up world vision , consensus-based , and more economically than politically driven . 
  rather economically-driven i 'd say yes but i really do n't see a bottom-up vision . 
  he 's basically presenting himself in the gaullist way `` without party , trust in me and what i evoke for you and follow me !, 
  '' , but stayed relativelly ambiguous on his program . 
  and being `` consensual '' in a centrist way do n't really makes you progressist to me . 
   still too conservative for this era ... on which points you 'd say ? 
  well of course not annoying gratuitously , but as a tool to pressure . 
  but two can play this game , and britain , while still being inside the eu is getting less and less a say in its moves . 
  also being independant and isolated are completely different things . 
  the us certainly is n't isolated from the eu , it has many relays of influence and try to preserve diplomatical capital/good will to call in favors or use it in negociations . 
  it is n't in britain 's interest , no matter how much isolationnist she want to be ( and she wo n't be that much , look at the trade flows ) , to keep as good relationships it can with its neighbors . 
  your position is basically `` yes , we can be pretty annoying if you do n't do as we say '' . 
  but it 's just burning diplomatic capital and unifying the others members against the uk , which become more and more isolated . 
  though he appeal mainly to center-left and center-right voters , and some abstensionnists/anti-establishment voters with a `` i 'm young and not from a party ! '', 
  rethoric . 
  in the end he is a centrist candidate , and this progressist/conservatism divide is just a way to valorise himself . 
  who want to be `` against progress '' ? 
  in the `` wrong sense of history '' ? 
  the ones defining politics as such are always the ones who considers themselves progressists and their opponents conservatists . 
  to me this historical determinism is very annoying . 
  you 're missing two other key aspects : the `` anti-establishment '' and the `` anti-globalisation '' ones . 
  sarkozy is a tactician more than a stratege , an impulsive more than a cold-blooded analyst . 
  he started on a wrong feet , went for the path of a strong relationship and then kinda ruined it by using the obtained good will to get russian agreement to a un mandate in libya in 2011 and stretching it to overthrow khadhafi . 
   ultra radical libertarian it 's laughable . 
  you 're just emptying words ' meaning with such hyperboles , and giving wrong indications to non-french people . 
  `` almost nothing '' , certainly not , just not enough to get to the second turn and very divided historically . 
  i 'd say there is a genuine mutual esteem , but as `` friendly '' as their relationship is it stay a political one first , with their country 's interests first ( cf their post-2012 relationship , fillon 's book `` faire '' , recent articles on le monde and le point , recent declaration of putin on fillon , which all paint a consistant picture ) . 
  fillon 's position is mainly based on the gaullist idea of seeking geopolitical counterbalances to the american alliance and on the need/usefullness of a fruitful dialogue/relationship with russia . 
  pessimism , cynism , nihilism ... we 're well equipped , takes your pick . 
  * cough cough * mali * cough cough * car * cough cough *, 
  france 's historically more friendly position toward russia has never been at the expense of the mutual protection of nato , even with de gaulle 's multiple actions and speeches he fully backed the us when it truly mattered ( u2 , cuba ... ) . 
  i absolutely do n't think fillon is going to gut france 's diplomacy just to appease putin . 
  the fn was able to `` distract '' from their many contradictions for years without needing this `` feud to entertain the masses '' . 
  if you 're saying they are willingly displaying their societal contradictions just to distract from something they do n't need to actively hide , that 's bullshit . 
   france does not have enough nukes to penetrate russian air defenses in a few years when they get more s-500 online . 
  source ? 
  the position of the state and the position of the public are completely different things . 
  and the weight of polls in such a scenario ( for a situation that appear unlikely and that would , if real , be preceded by much discutions and media coverage ) is dubious at best . 
  if a person is so obviously assimilated then no one cares , even the far-right , same thing with zemmour , hidalgo and plac\u00e9 . 
  yep , indeed , but only in the far-right and far left . 
  mostly we see germany as doing things better than us , and all pro-europeans are really attached to the idea of a franco-german couple . 
  in addition to what / u/haplo34 said , keep in mind that the institutions of the fifth republic are extremely solid and stable ( i mean , he stayed five years despite ridiculously low approval ratings ) and give a lot of power to the president . 
  proportionally , a french president have much more power at home than a german chancellor . 
  what?not being the favorite is no excuse . 
  if you present yourself for the presidency , you need a solid programm , in particular since you critisized the government saying : `` but it could be done otherwise , in a better way ! '' . 
  it 's his faukt because he promised he would have good results , and he had very bad ones . 
  yes , it 's the conjecture , but contrary to sarkozy it did n't fall on him in the midst of his mandate , he had time to analyse it . 
  and he made a bad analysis and false promises . 
  in particular a lot of promises he made to his most left-wing voters . 
  if you do n't have the panacea , then you do n't pretend to have it . 
  if you pretend to have it , then have at least the consistency to apply it . 
  that 's pretty much it , following germany . 
  though he had a slightly more pro-greece position than merkel . 
  no , he chose to not compete in the primary , only mean to get endorsed by the ps . 
  [ see my post ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5fyhr8/hollande_not_running_for_second_term/dao26aj/ ), 
  the main reasons are : - personnal lack of charisma - won the presidency in good part thanks to anti-sarkozism . 
  when you are elected because people vited against your opponent rather than for you , your approval/legitimity does n't start very high . 
  - he had years to prepare alternance , four years to prepare a counter to the crisis after critisizing the right-wing government , and when he comes to power the amateurism of him and several of his ministers are apparent . 
  a lot of bickering among his ministers and , it 's a first in the fifth republic ( outside cohabitation ) some ministers openly disrespect/undermine/mock him , and he does n't fire them . 
  - he underestimated the crisis , for the first two years he thought it would quickly solve itself , and did n't do much except increase taxes ( despite promising in campaign not to do so and antagonized a lot of french ) - he made some strong promises/speech in the 2011 left-wing primary to the left of his side , `` my enemy it 's [ the world of ] finances !, 
  '' , `` i 'll renegociate european treaties with merkel '' ... etc and did n't do any of that . 
  - to mask the fact he was n't taking any very left economic policy he chose to take a societally left measure : homosexual marriage ( polls gave it a slight majority for on principle but most thought it was n't the priority ) . 
  the contestation was surprisingly huge ( like , really ) but contrary to many tried reforms hollande did n't gave it up , which antagonized him strongly and durably a good chunk of the right - in the middle of his mandate he took valls as pm and took the path of more liberal reforms , `` betraying '' the left-wing of the ps - in general he tried to be ( his campaign 's words ) a `` normal president '' , but the french president is institutionnally and symbolicaly a president-king , he seems out of place and unnadapted to the post ( like sarkozy who acted as an hyperactive pm instead of a president arbiter ) . 
  - bad political moves here , there and there hope it helps , 
  well to be honest i do n't say `` useful lie '' with any strong feeling for or against it , even if it 's a bit provocating , `` useful delusion '' is probably a more suited term as it does n't necessarily imply intent behind . 
  yeah , you 'd think so ( france had like 1/6th of europe 's population under louis xiv ) , but europe had kind of a balance of power , and it 's a bit like eu4 , you ca n't just attack anything you want . 
  france spent the centuries slowly eating east and centralising itself around paris and the monarchy . 
  honestly , i think that christendom , and catholicism in particular , by setting a common framework ensured a competitiveness while still having some `` rules '' and strong exchanges , which explain europe emerging and dominating the way it did , instead of having a big empire swallowing around him and growing complacent . 
  geography probably played a role as well . 
  ... so i give you concrete exemple and you just tell me `` eh , go see in the litterature '' ? 
  fine . 
  no , i mean arab or african countries , on which people often wish to see our model of democracy on it `` because democracy is the best '' , without realising that there is the reality of regional , tribal and religious divide behind that make the imposition of our model on it unreasonable/unhealthy as long as things are in this cultural state . 
  jordan without the monarchy would have been ( and still would be ) completely screwed . 
  and syria is in civil war because many minorities do n't want a tyranny of the majority as in irak with maliki . 
  i just wanted to enlarge the debate beyond western nation-states , as we look upon undemocratic countries in the world with our ethnocentric lenses . 
  `` the people '' is a social construction that makes democracy works when enough people believe in it , it 's a useful lie . 
  there is no best system in absolute , it depends on the context . 
  democracy certainly was n't / is n't the best system in all scenario : if you 're not a nation-state , do n't have a common feeling of belonging to the same community ( if you belong to an ethnie or a region or a religious branch first , you just get tyranny of the majority or endorsed `` cleansing '' ) , or the comlunications or travel techniques are n't evolved enough , or a population of unalphabetes peasants whose horizon is the next village ... etc the `` best system '' does n't really exist . 
  it 's all about the most suited to the situation and the chosen priorities ( social justice , security , administration , stability ... ), 
  in a monarchy ( in particular of divine right ) they have it too . 
  nah , that 's not it . 
  china had no true regional rival , but europe was fiercely competitive , and france was more a first among peers than a true hegemon . 
  even strong , france had to fight spain , austria , german princepalties , england , or half of europe when it was in a good form . 
  and wars were hard-fought with both victories and defeat . 
  no , it 's a combinaison of other countries closing the demographic gap , internal conflicts , diplomatic/geostrategic errors and nationalism in the 19th . 
  it 's not so much france becoming weaker than its neighbors growing bigger and stronger , i 'd say . 
  how yeah , that 's annoying . 
  to be fair our doctrine and headquarters sucked quite a lot too in ww1 and 1870 too .

  underestimating the perdifious albion is a common mistake of non-french european . 
  no , if we 're weak and the us help them , they can manage to have best of eu and the usa and achieving to destroy the eu . 
  we have to economically destroy them , otherwise , france will give the coup fatal to the eu by leaving it . 
  it will not be for this year , but if the uk is ahead of france economically for the next french presidential election ( 2022 ) , be sure that france will leave the eu . 
  this will be the 5 most important years of the eu , do n't imagine that everything is written and that we just have to wait their demise . 
   we a $ re not out to punish britain he speaks for himself . 
  i really hope that we will punish uk so hard that they will have to become the next state of trumpistan . 
  loyalty , friendship , things like that . 
  but that 's the problem , uk joined the eu while saying clearly that they will always chose the us over europe . 
  it was a big mistake , de gaulle was fucking right . 
  ca n't wrap my mind around why people believed that uk was not the trojan horse of the us to destroy the eu . 
  you might be right , but i think you would be surprised how fast a language can die . 
  we know it very well in france because a lot of regional are completely extinct now , in something like 1-2 generations . 
  my grandfather can perfectly speak occitan but never use it really , my father understand it a little but ca n't speak it , i do n't speak it and ca n't understand a single word . 
  your conversion is nearly compl\u00e8te . 
  might be true , i come from the south , so it 's nearly only spanish here . 
  and globally france has not such a weak economy ( it 's still on par with the uk on basically every aspects ) , by the way , but it 's true that the north of france is in the worst situation . 
  i doubt it . 
  are you considering francophone belgians as french students ? 
  because in france , i do n't know a single person that learn dutch . 
  it 's more 40 % of french and 30 % of latin . 
  the most common words are german but the raw percent is actually quite low . 
  i understand your concern , brits , english is such a big disadvantage :( . 
  as your closest friend and neighbor , france agrees to take some of your disadvantage by using french as the lingua franca in europe . 
  friends exist for a thing . 
  we 're talking about normal countries with a lived language . 
  everybody knows that dutch is more or less dead , let 's call it a zombie language . 
  it 's depressing but yeah , our political landscape becomes more and more similar to the american one . 
  nevertheless , nothing is done , this election is extremely open . 
  i would say that only marine lepen is sure to not win ( even if she 's nearly sure to be qualified for the final ) and i can imagine various scenarios where all the other major candidates ( macron , fillon , m\u00e9lanchon and the winner of the socialist primaries ) have a chance . 
  he 's very right-wing economically for french standards , but less than fillon ( who 's very right-wing economically even for european standards ) . 
  by example , as a minister , he tried to legalize sunday work and other measures to facilitate layoffs that neither sarkozy or chirac would have dared . 
  also , keep in mind that e do n't really know his opinion about everything . 
  he 's very new and tends to be vague . 
  ecnomically : very right-wing and pro-liberal . 
  socially : kind of left-wing . 
  international views : pro-eu , atlantist . 
  there is not a lot of new things to expect of him , he 's just young , handsome and a very good communicator to make believe that he 's different even if it 's not really the case . 
  i would compare him to trudeau or obama , i.e. 
  essentially the same views than former governments but with a refreshing style + inspiring positive attitude . 
  economically , le pen is very left-wing ( this is the main difference between the daughter and the father ) . 
   you only have that because the british , americans and canadians liberated you . 
  frances still existed between 1940 and 1945 you know , and nazi germany was condemned to lose anyway . 
  today you learned : https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/13cxs4/til_that_the_french_military_actually_has_the/ france is the biggest territory of western europe , the geographic zone historically the most dense in terms of different world powers ( neighbour of germany , italy , spain , uk ... who has so many historically powerful neighbours in the world ? ) . 
  obviously , gaining and maintaining this territory required many military victories . 
  numbers are clear . 
  comparing a little island that you like to a country that is the military leader and the only nuclear power of the biggest economic zone of the world is a non-sense . 
  without france , the eu is nothing military . 
  without the eu , nato is just a uk-usa club . 
  consequently , it 's easy to understand that the us can not ignore the eu . 
  i just repeated the content of the article , what 's not clear ? 
   and i think that 's basically what the us wants , they do n't need our help to stomp other countries , but they do like to stand in front of a whole lot of other nations in the un and be able to claim it 's the right thing to do and we have international support . 
  well , france will not do that . 
  france can be a partner , not a lapdog . 
  read the article . 
  are you serious ? 
  well now that uk is out of the eu , you will have to talk to france or stay a two-country alliance . 
  well , history is more informative to know the culture of fighting of the inhabitant of a country . 
  your stereotype about frenchmen in the 20th century is based on what ? 
  a decision of some statemen that had to chose between seeing paris destroyed by german tanks or abdicate . 
  what 's the link with the bravery of french soldier ? 
  what 's the link with their fighting spirit , their `` esprit de corps '' ( a term used in the english language and directly borrowed from french for a reason ) ? 
  the french , the inhabitants of the most successful country military-wise in history ? 
   the french also think americans are , well , kind of wimpy . 
  one of the traits that stands out about french troops is `` a particular culture that , among other things , makes a virtue of roughing it and empowers risk taking , '' the report argues . 
  this . 
  i 'm a little bit surprised by the french one . 
  i would n't think that france is characterized by more logic compared to other countries . 
  is it a known sterotype across europe ? 
   swiss system is super regulated for all `` basic '' stuff . 
  what exactly in swiss health insurance is `` try to fuck you '' ? 
  so many different contracts by so many different corporations ... 
  i believed that choosing a mobile contract was a nightmare , but that was because i 've never had to chose a swiss heath insurance . 
  and the worst ? 
  it changes every year . 
  every year , i 've got the feeling that different companies have the least expensive contract . 
  it 's also extremely complicated to have automatic transfer for the payment and i had regularly to pay huge penalties for payment delays . 
  i 've got the feeling to constantly manage ( payments , penalties , chosiing a contract , checking every year if this is still the best deal ... ) this `` obligatory service '' than i never use . 
   this says that the greece system is better than the swiss system . 
  sorry , but i ca n't take that serious ... 
  i mean , yeah , the swiss system is expensive but it 's also a rich country , so you are better of with that . 
  i can ensure you that swiss tend to completely overestimate their standards ( on many aspects ) compared to other european countries . 
  i had some crazy discussions where swiss explain how happy they are with things that would trigger massive strikes in france . 
  i do n't know if it 's cultural , but the simple fact that you can actually believe that this ranking is not more serious says everything . 
  you simply ca n't compare with france where nearly everything is completely free for the hobo or the millionaire . 
  you can critisize the system as not sustainable or something else like that , but you ca n't deny that the system is just actually better for the people . 
   the idea of health insurance is to help people that have serious health issues and not for people that constantly go see the doctor for every nonsense . 
  this is not the mindset in france where we encourage to go regularly for a general check-up ( dentist by example ) . 
  also , i have to treat some dental caries , what should i do ? 
  paying up to 2500 chf ( my contract does n't refund anything below that ) or taking a more expensive contract ( which will be probably more expensive than the 2500 chf in the long-term , particularly when you know that dental caries is an affair of 2-3 sessions ) ? 
  or maybe changing my contract depending on the year if i 've got more or less not-so-urgent-but-important thing to do for my health ? 
  but what if i 've got something int he middle of the year ? 
  should i wait up to 9 months to have my dental caries treated with the appropriate contract after having to deal with bureaucratic stuff and miselading comparisons between all thse privatee companies that advertise their contract as the best one for me ? 
  you see the idea . 
  when you grew up in an environment where `` health = too important for budget calculation '' , the swiss system is brutal ( and extremely not egalitarian ) . 
  good for you if you 're happy with that and if some metrics that miss some important points confort you in your satisfaction , but even if i like switzerland for tons of things , healthcare is certainly not something that have been an improvement in my life . 
   this `` minimum insurance '' is actually better than what you get in most other countries . 
  i compared it to the french one ( which is universal and completely free ) . 
  i spend ~ 10 % of my salary in the swiss healthcare ( the least expensive one ) and i have to pay by myself more than 2500 chf in one year before having any refund . 
  you might be happy with that , but i can ensure you that it 's completely crappy for french standards .

  if they do not , taxes may or may not increase . 
  unless you 're from the future , you can not argue that taxes will increase because of brexit . 
  however , i do n't need to be from the future to tell you that taxes in france will increase because we 're broke . 
  but i was n't questioning the choice of napol\u00e9on as leader but the ua . 
  the ua is shite imo . 
  whether it was an invasion or an invitation has been a hot topic between historians . 
  personally , my opinion leans towards the disguised invasion . 
  that 's a very one sided view . 
  europeans are mad about brexit because it brought a wave of uncertainty about their future and the future of the eu . 
  europeans are mad about brexit because it 's a decision taken by 17 million people that will affect close to 500 million , or even more . 
  europeans are mad because for decades the uk has benefited from a much better deal than the rest of us , and yet still managed to complain about pretty much everything . 
  europeans are mad because this whole affair proved itself to be a complete shit fest of lies , political manoeuvring , backstabbing , and that save for a couple of people nobody put forward or reflected on a possible plan in the event of brexit . 
  however democratic or sovereign this decision may have been , people have a right to express their anger and concerns . 
  as to the uk 's contributions , for all we know they 'll still be giving the eu money . 
  i never said he started the napoleonic wars . 
  city of lights is a reference to paris being the first to use gas light and/or because of the enlightenment . 
  either way , the ua is a poor fit for napol\u00e9on as a leader . 
  i actually agreed with your last sentence , but not really with the first which i felt out of touch with the article . 
  i just found this article interesting ( apparently people did not ) and a nice change from the usual economic doom , racism etc. . 
  which has surrounded brexit . 
  i know , but it bothers me . 
  the whole french civ bothers me tbh . 
  also the blue is the wrong hue . 
  i do n't know which cities his army burned , but i assume he left a few smoldering pile of ashes behind him . 
  some might argue that william of orange did not conquer england but rather that he was invited over . 
  others might answer that when someone invite you over , you do n't bring an entire army with you . 
  napol\u00e9on is not a bad leader for a french civ , but the ua is shit . 
  `` city of lights '' ? 
  is this a reference to all the cities his armies burned , or the countless art pieces we stole ? 
  it does n't fit napoleonic france imo . 
  you could argue that it is a reference to the enlightenment , but then again not exactly the best leader . 
  they should have gone with a military oriented ua . 
  hopefully they change it in civ 6 . 
  edit : apparently i angered some people by disapproving the glorious leader . 
  i 'm not sure you read the article . 
  also knowing one of the authors , i can assure you she 's not a radical feminist . 
  i do n't get why this sits at 0 point as i 'm writing this comment . 
  it 's newsworthy , it 's from a reputable media , and it cites its sources . 
  i 'm sorry we 're trying to stick it to the english , but it 's the first decent shot in centuries , so we 're gon na go ahead and take it . 
  i thought i 'd share a brexit-related article that is slightly different , and explores possible long-term social and political consequences of the referendum . 
  it 's not so much that we do n't vote in the first round , but rather that we use it as a protest vote . 
  some chose not to vote , some vote for third parties . 
  can i join ? 
  the historian in me winced at your argument that history is useless without looking at the big picture , but i have to agree to a degree . 
  however , more history is not a bad idea but it depends which histories . 
  the curriculum omits large swaths of our history like the 1st colonial empire , algerian war and the list goes on . 
  we even have ( had ? ), 
  a law which dictated that when teaching colonialism , you should emphasise the benefits of it . 
  last november , my professor told me that one of the main advisor for the history curriculum threatened to resign because of how bad it was . 
  what we need is not more history , but better history that do n't lag decades behind what 's going on in the academia and which also includes input from non-french historians of france , because they often have powerful insight not tainted by jingoism . 
  teaching a bit of european history would not be a bad thing either , if we 're to build an ever closer union ( then again i do n't see the fn advocating that ) . 
  sorry i went on a bit of rant there , but the state of the historical profession in france tends to make me mad . 
  france : the government decided that it was too much work to obtain the consent of parliament to pass a heavily contested labour reform . 
  all hail the 49.3 . 
  people would be a lot more informed . 
  maybe . 
  we said the same thing about hitler 's earliest actions in pretty much the same way . 
  i 'm not arguing that this is a similar situation , but complacency is extremely dangerous . 
  for those who do want to read his column . 
  there is no risk whatever to the status of the eu nationals now resident and welcome in the uk , and indeed immigration will continue -- but in a way that is controlled , thereby neutralising the extremists . 
  it is overwhelmingly in the economic interests of the other eu countries to do a free-trade deal , with zero tariffs and quotas , while we extricate ourselves from the eu law-making system . 
  we can do free-trade deals with economies round the world , many of which are already applying . 
  we can supply leadership in europe on security and other matters , but at an intergovernmental level . 
  the future is very bright indeed . 
  that 's what geldof should be chanting . 
  source : http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/07/03/tory-candidates-need-a-plan-for-brexit---heres-mine-in-5-points/ ( thank you u/mikeemoo ) basically , he wants the same situation as before , except no decisionary power about the eu 's actions but the uk will be able to make trade deals with whoever they want with their 20 negotiators , so that 's a pretty cool deal i guess . 
  england is 11th . 
  above france and italy . 
  austria is 10th . 
  that should tell you all you need to know . 
  oh and brazil is 7th . 
  but it 's very likely that there will be a general election before 2020 . 
  that 's the logical thing to do . 
  then again , logic does not appear to be politicians ' strongest suit . 
  that 's what i thought about the fn in france too . 
  let them have a region , let them fuck it up and it 'll cool down people . 
  like everything else , we have a tendency to see the world in black or white . 
  that wo n't be much more difficult for the players given the state of most of the pitches . 
  it 's been said repeatedly in this sub before , but the eu needs to step up it 's communication . 
  yes , you can find their decisions and such , but it does n't mean that you have the knowledge to understand them . 
  what they need , in my opinion , is to have those decisions turned into tl ; dr , explain in layman 's term why such decision was taken , and what it is going to change . 
  the lack of education about the eu is baffling . 
  if the eu is to succeed people have to be made aware of it 's structure and importance . 
  they also need to expand the erasmus program , because if we 're to have a closer union , people have to know each other , how their neighbours live , we need to learn to live together and not rely on prejudices and stereotypes that are as old as europe itself . 
  that 's my 2 cents though . 
  my first sentence referred to a unilateral independence . 
  spain said it would n't veto a scottish membership as long as it 's mutual . 
  the comment i responded was talking about unilaterally declaring scotland free . 
  and then spain will veto any scottish candidacy . 
  in any case the title is misleading as always . 
  he said that there wo n't be talks with a uk bound scotland , which was pretty clear from the start . 
  edit : since the first sentence does not appear to be clear . 
  spain would veto a scottish candidacy in the event of a unilateral declaration . 
  and that 's what i 'm doing , 
  and may or may not be corrupt . 
  it 's like who do they think they are with their big ballotery . 
  * i 'll see myself out . 
  i like that italians think like the french about the sexual lives of politicians . 
  it 's not a threat , it 's a fail safe which the uk agreed to . 
  diplomatic ?

  given their history and position , poland positioned itself geopolitically with the greatest power in the 90s and 00s , obviously the us . 
  that 's probably the greatest reason why they went for boeing , and us military vehicles . 
  it 's kind of a shame , but i guess i understand them . 
  i 'm surprised so many in western europe say china instead of the us . 
  fact of the matter is that the us is by far a larger economy than china . 
  maybe that wo n't last another decade or two , but for now the us is still the largest economy , and the center of world trade . 
  no matter how many goods are `` made in china '' . 
  i mean , for now it does n't seem there are many killings of opponents and journalists . 
  so we 're not at russia 's level yet . 
  where are my mussels with those crunchy fries ? 
  from my perspective in france , portugal definitely seems to be more and more popular as a tourist destination for french people , since the last decade . 
  not wanting to be insulting , but before that perhaps portugal was seen as a comparatively lame place to go to . 
  a poor man 's spain if you will . 
  now i guess , the trends and perspectives make portugal a valuable destination , even perhaps something to brag about . 
  it 's still perceived as an `` original '' destination , even though that may not be true anymore , but that also helps . 
  germany is the greatest power in europe , and it does have a lot of influence in europe , but it hardly has the international diplomatic reach that france has outside of europe . 
  if for only reason that france had a larger colonial presence around the world , but also , i 'd say , because of french diplomacy being historically very entrenched around the world . 
  economics do n't account for everything . 
  now i 'm surprised that france beats britain ( even just barely ) considering the commonwealth and its former colonial empire . 
  i guess the brexit may even things out between france and britain , as both have international diplomatic reach , but france is ( and was always , i guess ) stronger in the eu . 
  most open antisemitism in france has little to do with the dreyfus affair or any old school french antisemitism . 
  while i do n't deny that some old school catholics and far-right groups may harbor antisemitic thought , it 's pretty clear that the feeling of insecurity that some jews in france may feel in everyday life is more related to the muslim community 's animosity against jews because of the arab-israeli conflict . 
  yeah , we 're always to blame , as usual . 
  i 'd rather blame franco and hitler . 
  but to each his own . 
  macron seems to always do that staring thing . 
  after the parade he went in the crowd and shook hands/hugged random people ( or perhaps they were the family of veterans or something , if not widows and orphans ) , and he 'd stare way too much into people 's eyes . 
  i think it 's to try and convey that he cares and respects the people he 's interacting with , but it just comes off as awkward imo . 
  right , it 's like 30 euros a day , but it seems costly considering it 's just spectacles you sit down and watch . 
  and also typically one should stay in one of the themed hotels for a night to have the full experience and time to see everything in a couple days . 
  disneyland accounts for a huge portion of the local economy of the north-eastern suburb of paris . 
  france does pay a lot for the maintenance of the park , but it 's quite useful for the development of the area . 
  also , we can complain all we want , it 's a wonderful place to go to for kids . 
  i have great memories going there . 
  it 's rates as the best theme park in the world so , it 's quite well rated . 
  however , indeed , it 's probably under-visited . 
  i 'm surprised it 's more popular than park ast\u00e9rix though . 
  i mean not only is it in a western corner of france ( not central ) , it 's also somewhat expensive , especially considering it 's the sort of place where you should at least stay for a night . 
  they added a wwi theme spectacle , where you walk through trenches and watch the daily life of soldiers [ here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6lslp3noy0 ) . 
  looks intense as fuck . 
  children cry :p, 
  and if you have kids , i would go to puy du fou , though it 's costly . 
  oh , right , i guess it does depend on the teacher . 
  my history teachers were typically left wing , and thus not very sympathetic to emperors :p anyway , to answer your first question , i 've heard here and there that napoleon is somewhat well viewed in countries like croatia and slovenia . 
  i may be wrong , but that 's what i was told from croatians here and there . 
  but perhaps that was just their personal opinions . 
  otherwise , my brother visited the site of the battle of austerlitz in czechia , and apparently the locals there were super into napoleon and very happy to show french people around and talk about how they thought napoleon was so cool :p, 
  actually , when i was in school , some 10 years ago , we hardly mentioned napoleon , and that is actually a subject of controversy really , how little he is mentioned in the public school system . 
  but the little he is mentioned , in my experience it 's quite a neutral stance . 
  he 's presented as a historical figure , a result of the revolution , and not much more . 
  in everyday life , however , when we french people happen to mention napoleon , you 'll have those who admire him ( i 'm among them , to be honest ) , and those who consider him a despot , but most people are in between , and do n't really care or know enough to have an opinion . 
  so i 'd say opinion is quite evenly distributed . 
  that 's a handsome pint if i 've ever seen one . 
  it 's not phoney , but we do call it the `` phoney war '' . 
  personally , looking back , i think we should have tried to attack germany instead of camping . 
  but it 's easy to say from my perspective , and regardless , the point is that we still entered the war , whether we fought well or not . 
  i do n't know , to me the condescension comes from those complaining that france and britain did n't win the war for them . 
  actually , it 's more than condescension , it 's pretty offensive considering those who died . 
  of course , surely nazi germany would have eventually maybe declared war on france . 
  but that 's not what we 're debating is it ? 
  we 're talking about whether or not france and britain respected their treaty with poland . 
  they did . 
  debate over . 
   we were one of most loyal allies of napoleon and we stayed loyal to the end yeah , i know that very well . 
  poland were essentially the only real allies of napoleonic france in europe . 
  we got some statues of j\u00f3zef poniatowski in paris here and there . 
  i 'm just glad he died before the ultimate defeat of france and warsaw . 
  actually , poland was back in 1806 , when france kicked prussia 's ass and recreated the duchy of warsaw out of ashes . 
  but the poles prefer complaining that we lost in 1940 . 
  sorry for not winning every time ya ungrateful bastards !, 
  i know it 's a joke , but poles seem obsessed about this ww2 thing so i thought i 'd give them an answer . 
  first and foremost , france and britain did declare war on germany the moment poland was attacked . 
  sure , there was that phoney war deal , but we still kept our part of the bargain and went into a war that we did n't want to be in , just for you . 
  and that bargain was shit . 
  it was one sided in poland 's favour , as such a treaty was only about britain/france defending poland , considering poland could n't realistically defend britain/france with their capabilities . 
  but yeah , we signed the deal , so it was our fault and responsibility . 
  but you should be happy we signed that deal in the first place . 
  ultimately , with britain holding out as long as it did , that saved the war for you , so be thankful millions gave their lives for you ultimately , even if it only payed off years later . 
  finally , poland was a quasi-dictatorship that took a part of czechia with nazi germany . 
  do n't pretend you 're angels . 
  you did n't deserve us . 
  but i 'm happy we allied with you anyway . 
  just do n't push it , 
  everyone always has their little opinion about not caring for the food in a typically praised culinary region when they went there that one time as a tourist . 
  i thought food in italy was fantastic . 
  they have great culinary standards , and i 'll general side with the general consensus from people who know what they 're talking about that italy has a superb food culture in general . 
  i love snails , that garlic-butter sauce is something , and it 's a great little appetizer . 
  but it 's definitely a rare occasion to eat snails . 
  even in burgundy . 
  the only time i 've tried frog legs was as a joke meal for foreigners . 
  turned out ok . tastes like a mix between fish and chicken . 
  it reminds me watching the us version of master chef , at some point the candidates had to cook a french-themed meal and they were completely lost , not really knowing what qualified as a french dish . 
  yeah , we do n't really have an internationally known purely french dish , like other countries have clich\u00e9 dishes like pizza , or hamburger , or sushi and kebab ( apart from cr\u00eapes i guess ) . 
  thing is that if you cook some meat with oignons and herbs , and a side of vegetables with a mother sauce , that 's your french dish for you . 
  for most people it 's just normal food , but that 's the french influence on the culinary arts . 
  you 're the one crying a river , mate . 
  no one gives a shit about this here . 
  but if you ask the french , all would say the french government did the wrong thing here . 
  we do n't owe you fuck all for ww2 , just so you know , the same way no one owes france for any war where france was on their side . 
  however , france does owe its friends and allies to not to this sort of thing to them .

  but that is exactly what you are saying . 
  by looking at number of muslims vs how many joined isis , you immediately assume that there is something ** intrinsic ** in islam that turns people terrorist . 
  be it 1 in 3k or 1 in 25k there is a small probability that ** a muslim ** will turn terrorist * because * they are muslim . 
  it is intrinsic to their beliefs and as such they can not escape it . 
  take your favourite muslim friend and they 'll have a ** non-zero ** probability to join isis . 
  while you being non muslim , have a ** zero ** probability to join isis . 
  i believe that such a belief is severely misguided and severely wrong . 
  ** your muslim friend has the same probability to join isis as you have because you have the same circle of friends , same experiences , etc etc etc ** that is why when i calculate probability i divide ** by the whole population of france ** and not divide just by the population of muslims . 
  the fact that 1/4th of isis french terrorists are recent converts supports my view that is not a muslim community problem as you make it seem . 
   would white people call the kkk `` true whites '' ? 
  if the pope says you 're not catholic , are you still a catholic ? 
  no by the very definition of being catholic . 
   seriously now ? 
  that 's your argument ? 
  yes . 
  no imam in france or albania will call the terrorist muslims . 
  how can they be muslims if the vast majority of muslims declare they are not ? 
   just like any group does when there is a terrorists organization that claims to do acts in their name . 
  unfortunately that is n't enough to stop every fucked up idiot to believe the terrorists propaganda . 
  well they 're french , albanians etc as they have french , albanian etc passports . 
  and as such i judge them as french and as albanians . 
  isis is a radical-muslim movement . 
  the muslim community states that isis is not muslim and are committing unmuslim acts . 
  where as they are french since they hold french passport . 
  they are albanians since they hold albanian passports . 
  how many imams in france or in albania would openly declare : yeah the terrorists are muslims !, 
  you tell me . 
  that 's why i do n't do statistics based on muslim communities . 
  also 1/4 of isis members from france are converts http://www.lexpress.fr/actualite/societe/pourquoi-y-a-t-il-tant-de-convertis-parmi-les-djihadistes-francais-de-l-etat-islamique_1624282.html  so ... your stats of muslim/isis muslim look worse than theirs . 
  but obviously , ** since you look at just the muslim community ** that means you believe the muslim community holds inherent danger . 
  and who has a high muslim community ? 
   last time i checked isis is an islamic terrorist group so you 're talking specifically about muslims here . 
  last time i checked the muslim community states that isis are n't muslim . 
  so you tell me . 
   yes , and that 's why i explained that as a percentage of the muslim community of those countries , but muslims declare that isis are n't muslim . 
  and now you 're saying that they are muslims and that they draw heavily from the muslims community . 
  as such , having a muslim community seems dangerous , according to your analysis . 
  sure some may be more dangerous than others , but clearly the fact that the muslim community exists , is a danger . 
   we 're talking about radicalization of muslims since only muslims are dangerous , then is n't it better to not have any muslims then ? 
   stop grasping at straws trying to make it look like albania , bosnia or kosovo are having somekind of major problem with radicalization . 
  well you 're saying it 's a radicalisation of muslims . 
  you know who has a lot of muslims ? 
  albania bosnia and kosovo . 
   , he said that albania has the lowest chance of a muslim radicalising . 
  so only muslims can be radicalised then ? 
  clearly muslims are a danger then if only they can be radicalised . 
  akshually that 's a [ locomotive ] ( http://imgur.com/a/xgd9w ) . 
   i bet there is not a lot of non-muslims who joined isis , lol . 
  a lot of french , albanians , syrians , iraqis etc joined isis too . 
  and between those nationalities , albanians are much more numerous on a per capita basis of their nationality . 
  and inside they 're better than tgvs, 
  again , why are you only considering shares of muslim populations when looking at terrorism in france or belgium ? 
  are you saying that the muslim populations are dangerous ? 
   albania is majority muslim . 
  i 'm talking about terrorists here not muslims . 
   well yes , you look at per capita to see big vs small country in fairer terms , but . 
  albania ( and bosnia and kosovo ) have muslim majorities why are you bringing the fact that there 's a muslim majority in the country in this discussion ? 
  does that make them more dangerous ? 
  well i 'll keep that in mind when and if bosnia , kosovo or albania want to join the eu then . 
   per muslim population the lowest . 
  so you 're saying that a higher muslim population means a higher terrorist population ? 
  is that the argument you 're making ? 
  and a lower overall muslim population means fewer terrorists ? 
  quite an interesting comment from a kosovar which is in its majority muslim . 
   then france . 
  do you have any official statistics about the number of muslims in france ? 
  because i do n't . 
   how 's it irrelevant ? 
  in you just ca n't argue with certain people man . 
  roll eyes and move on because some people dont do logic . 
   ( that last one , well let 's just say that albania is far from the top exporter ) i meant in europe . 
   which is seriously tiny , when looking at a country of 3 million . 
  still large numbers per capita . 
  how else would you compare a huge country vs a small country ? 
   they prefer organized crime over religiously motivated stuff . 
  per capita , albania has one of the highest number of people that went to join isis, 
   tfw when the presence of military in almost every bigger city in europe is normal and necessary , what have you done ... 
  wait , do n't you need nato troops in the east ? 
  like just yesterday there was a thread about german troops in lithuania . 
   he 'll end his life on a wheelchair since then . 
  well that 's friggin optimistic is n't it ? 
   last time i checked poland was no. 1 germany trade partner . 
  dude , no way you think poland is the main destination of german imports and exports . 
  http://atlas.media.mit.edu/en/profile/country/deu/ poland is the 10th destination for german exports . 
  about half the size of china . 
   13 billion per year in exchange to free entrance to their market eh . 
  china buys much more france and germany than poland . 
  it is also a much bigger market . 
  they also invest in europe much more than poland . 
  citroen peugeot would have no existed without chinese help , the chinese are working with the french to build the nuclear powerplant in the uk . 
  yeah not like they had the first satellite , the first man in space , the first woman in space , mir and other stuff . 
   i do n't understand why norway is so low ( # 31 ) . 
  i just sent you a letter explaining why . 
  when you 'll receive it , you 'll know how good it is . 
  here we 're talking about russian estonians that decide to start a protest or whatever . 
  if 10 % of your population starts some sort of violent protest , you wo n't put all of them in jail will you ? 
  this is hypotheticals . 
   wannacry was not the result of encryption backdoors or backdoors in general . 
  the `` logic '' behind backdoors is that politicians tells us that only the good guys will have the keys to backdoors . 
  that was the same logic was applied for wcry and we can see that it failed extremelly badly .

  how 's that relevant to the topic ? 
   what she said pre-referendum may just have been because she had to say those things . 
  and now we 're seeing the true may right ? 
   what an optimistic bunch you brits are . 
   and has scrapped the largest of them , like the akula class , it was large because the ussr did n't have the essential know how needed to miniaturise h bombs . 
  therefore they needed larger missiles than the us , therefore they needed larger subs than the us . 
  smaller is better . 
  suck it netherlands !, 
  greek macedonia ? 
  what 's that ? 
  i mean macedonia macedonia . 
  you know ... with alexander and stuff . 
  i 'm talking about the * real * macedonia man . 
   which is what this particular thread was about . 
  did you read the thread ? 
  / u/zicklein said that ceta was scary when the guy he replied to talked about 200k losing their jobs and companies having the right to sue govts for perceived loss of benefits . 
  / u/jtalin asked why it 's scary . 
  ( because reading 2 comments before is tough apparently ) . 
  / u/mr-oldfart went the way his name implies and derped out some shitty comment about how / u/zicklein is scared about the cap . 
  tl ; dr : read the comments people . 
   on a level playing field eh . 
  there are 4 eu countries that export more than canada ( france being one of them , +50 % ) . 
  doubt anyone is shaking in their boots . 
  [ sauce ] ( http://www.worldatlas.com/articles/the-american-food-giant-the-largest-exporter-of-food-in-the-world.html ), 
  what 's that have to do with the walloons rejecting ceta ? 
   legislation legal system in canada is based on [ common law ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/92/map_of_the_legal_systems_of_the_world_%28en%29.png ) . 
  as you can see it 's quite different from continental europe . 
   overall relations again if we 're talking about uk , yeah . 
  but concerning the rest of europe , i do not think they 're particularly warm or anything . 
  romania and bulgaria still need a visa to visit . 
  canada added a visa for czechia a few years ago before removing it . 
  and economy ? 
  they 're not that linked . 
  and the estimated benefit from ceta is about 2 billion euros per year . 
  for a region the size of the eu , that 's not exactly mind blowing . 
   canada is very similar to europe culturally . 
  what does that have to do with trade ? 
  when you go shopping , do you select the seller that is the closest to you culturally ? 
  canada does n't owe us and we do n't owe it anything . 
  they 're not our special , magical friend . 
  they 're a counterparty to a treaty . 
  if a country thinks the treaty is non beneficial ( and there are good reasons to believe that ) they will reject the treaty . 
  it has nothing to do with values , ideals , hopes , dreams . 
  someone forgot to colour in macedonia and montenegro . 
   but the general trend remains to describe pretty much every right wing party as such . 
  that 's populism . 
  even if you were proven wrong , you still continue hammering the same beat because `` general trend '' . 
  trump would be proud . 
   it ca n't even conclude a deal with probably the most european country outside of europe ? 
    that makes 0 sense . 
  yeah dude . 
  we french people spend our day thinking about the cap . 
  just like brits constantly think about the city . 
   here in italy they spared no words for describing them populist and xenophobic . 
  the give friggin sources on ovp being populist . 
  i sure wan na read that . 
  cuz you 're bsing . 
   italian right wing berlusconi was a populist . 
  he was an idiot that should have gone to jail a few times and that made your country a laughing stock . 
   austrian right wing party ** nobody ** has called the ovp a populist party . 
   pretty much everything right wing . 
  i think you know next to nothing about european politics . 
  torries , cdu , ump , pp . 
  here 's the major 4 right wing parties from 4 major european countries . 
  and they 've never been called populists in any real context . 
  stop imagining things . 
   now there 's been an abuse of this term lately where virtually all right wing parties calm down buddy . 
  i doubt the cdu or ump have ever been labelled populist . 
  ever hear of something called ** op ed ** ? 
  if not , go google it buddy , 
  dnft . 
  i prefer the weegie . 
   a digital english version though ? 
  a british person will buy from a british store with a british credit/debit card that is connected to a british billing address . 
  so they 're buying a localised ( and not a localized btw ) version . 
   well into other democratic beliefs . 
  i was surprised to see even france ( ! ), 
  ahead of germany in public attitudes , given how much the french love to prosecute speech . 
  we 're starting the \u00b0 '' ' early today . 
  what office employee needs word macros that involve thousands of lines ? 
   1.6 % , so adding 0.3 i wrote ** 0.03 % ** . 
  http://arstechnica.co.uk/tech-policy/2016/06/ceta-canadian-ttip-what-is-it/ and it could be 0.01 % . 
  so it could be some 2 billion euros ... 
  so it 's best to write it in word ? 
  right ? 
  so if they want a doxygen doc in a nice big pdf , with god forbid 1-2 mathematical formulas ? 
  what the heck do you do ? 
  still use word for that ? 
   they 've been overcharging uk prices are higher in europe . 
  such is life . 
   dunno what percentage of time was actually lost due to non-familiarity , but it was in there . 
  you miss my point . 
  i gave examples of stuff you can not do without . 
  they 're things you learn when you get your education ...  i 've written more material in latex than word over the past twenty years & nbsp ;  i definitely would take longer to dash off a formatted document in latex than microsoft office even today . 
  you 're just bsing now . 
   as for latex , it 's too difficult to learn properly and there is no good editor for latex for the end-user . 
  what kind of company are you working at man ? 
   how many hours did it take you to learn latex ? 
  how many hours did it take you to learn c++ , matlab , git , matplotlib ? 
  latex at a certain level becomes an essential tool .

  i mostly listen to black and death metal , so i have too many to choose from . 
  but i 'll just throw out [ satyricon - mother north ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cycxbh1hwpg ) cause it 's a genuinely good song , and the music video is not only hilariously old school , there 's a naked chick in it too ( edit : nsfw ), 
   r / ** europe ** , are there any ** latin ** words and ** phrases ** that are part of your ** language ** ? 
  i bolded the words in your ** question ** which come from ** latin ** . 
  i never ** studied latin ** , but i do speak french , so i know these words have a latin ** basis ** . 
  more seriously , i get what you 're asking . 
  you 're rather asking for latin expressions , or certain phrases which are clearly taken directly from latin . 
  not just an etymology thing . 
  and i 'd contend most european languages have these same latin expressions . 
  but to expand on your question , there are some expressions which are known as historical phrases . 
  they 're not used in everyday sentences , but are known . 
  in france , we know `` vae victis '' , which means `` woe to the vanquished '' , which is what the gallic leader brennus supposedly said to the romans when he sacked the city in 390bc . 
  then a more famous phrase is obviously `` veni , vedi , vici '' . 
  oh so that 's the one . 
  i remember it caused somewhat of a scandal . 
  but georges fr\u00eache was old school . 
  imagine when self-driving cars will be a thing . 
  you could program the car from england to romania . 
  it would take the eurostar on its own and cruise around back to your doorstep like it 's no thing . 
  ( only problem for now would be gas however ) . 
  statues are typically erected in public spaces to honor the person or event they 're depicting . 
  they 're not about solely educating the public to how a historical person looked like . 
  to answer op 's question , i 'm assuming most of the statues of lenin in western europe were erected by a left wing town counsel in the aftermath of ww2 , at a time when the left wing was still rather pro-ussr , before solzhenitsyn released `` the gulag archipelago '' in the 70s and the left wing in western europe thus started to distance themselves from anything related to russian communism . 
  haha , that 's awesome . 
  that side up they look like these huge chimneys in these industrial reactors or whatever they 're called . 
  there 's even a sequence with a plane flying above the towers . 
  it 's mostly a private group financing this , there 's not enough office space in paris proper , and this area which is la d\u00e9fense in the outskirts of paris is the biggest business district in europe . 
  also , in addition to offices , the building will house rather luxury apartments , and the rich typically are n't too hurt by the last crisis or current stagnation . 
  well `` aux '' is more multimeaning . 
  for example `` la cage aux folles '' literally means `` the cage of the crazy people '' , or `` the crazy people 's cage '' . 
  so `` la mort aux juifs '' can mean `` the death of the jews '' or `` the jewish people 's death '' ; where `` death '' is the subject noun of the phrase , and not the action `` death to jews '' . 
  kind of hard to explain . 
  it 's not a town , it 's a hamlet `` which consists of a farm and two houses '' . 
  anyway , i got ta admit i 'm shocked . 
  i remember seeing a similar story on reddit , maybe just a few months ago , about a village in spain with the same name in spanish . 
  it 's incredible we only hear of this now . 
  anyway yeah . 
  there 's a subtlety to the name due to the `` la '' in front of the title . 
  literally , the translation is rather `` the death to jews '' or `` the death of the jews '' . 
  i find that in french there 's an added subtlety which gives that name somewhat of a more ominous vibe , and it seems entirely possible that it 's not meant as an insult , but rather holds a dark historical testimony to it . 
  nonetheless , i do think the name should be changed because it is ambiguous . 
  i wonder if andorans can go to a french or spanish university without being considered foreigners or something . 
  must be a hassle . 
  approximately how long would it take to walk/hike from one end of the island to the other ? 
  with a population of some 400,000 or so , do you feel it 's limiting in some way ? 
  as in too small to meet every different kind of person ? 
  or does it simply feel like a big city ? 
  considering malta is the only european country which speaks a semitic language , and considering your geographical distance to the continent , is there any sentiment in malta of not being entirely european or something ? 
  being kind of apart ? 
  i remember something about the context being slightly relevant though . 
  something about the roma either calling him a nazi , or doing the nazi salute to him to insult him or something . 
  basically playing the `` you 're a nazi because you do n't want us to illegally squat land in your town '' game . 
  the mayor thus responded to sarcasm with sarcasm . 
  now it definitely was n't clever of him at all , and as an elected official he should show restraint . 
  but he surely responded emotionally and did n't control himself , was n't the one who brought up hitler/nazism in the first place , and went too far . 
  that fish and chips for the uk looks dry as fuck . 
  i 'd rather some delicious baked beans . 
  well it 's kind of like poutine in canada . 
  it 's really a quebec thing originally , but it 's big enough to be considered canada 's national dish now . 
  cr\u00eapes are largely spread enough around france for it to be considered a national dish . 
  though personally i would n't have chosen cr\u00eapes to represent france , and especially not a sugar desert cr\u00eape ( if it must be a cr\u00eape i would rather have chosen a more traditional and rustic [ dark wheat salty cr\u00eape ] ( http://www.ouest-cornouaille.com/upload/ble-noir-complete_creperie-menlanndu-xl.jpg ) . ), 
  dat great european plain from northern france to western russia . 
  great for invading armies . 
  i do n't think so . 
  i feel scolded , like i 'm responsible for irish debt . 
  yeah , i do realize that , but i naturally meant that it 's just the right size for train travel to be more practical than airplane imo . 
  if it were slightly larger , then airplane travel would be preferred . 
  but overall , i do think france is the perfect size for a country  . 
  it takes a day 's car ride to go from one end to the other . 
  so everything is reachable , but not too close either . 
  well some people do ride bikes to train stations of course . 
  but overall the bike riding culture is n't remotely close to what exists in the netherlands . 
  the city of paris has in the last decade or two been very liberal , and wanting to develop public transports , cleanliness , an environment-friendly city and all , but they have n't made any visible efforts to really improve bicycle safety and access . 
  i think they should really focus on that , and only then will people be encouraged to actually use bikes to get around . 
  in paris you can definitely live car free . 
  cars are actually a hassle in the city . 
  the metro system , and bus system , is very extensive and goes all over . 
  there 's probably not a place in paris which is n't maximum 10 minutes walking distance from a metro station . 
  strikes or whatnot are much rarer than the stereotype , though there may be occasionally some delays on a given metro line a few times a year because of a technical problem ( or a suicide ... ) . 
  the city and region ( including the suburbs ) is currently investing a lot to improve the metro and train system , building many more lines and stations , in paris and through the suburbs . 
  currently in the suburbs there are many train lines which go to paris , but unless you live next to a train station , you 'll probably need a car to get to the train station because the public rail system does n't cover all the suburbs as well as it does paris . 
  public buses cover enough of suburbs however , so they 're the preferred method of public transport for now . 
  paris has installed lots of [ city bicycles for rent ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/aa/v%c3%a9lib%27.jpg ) . 
  but the city is n't bike-friendly . 
  there are rarely bicycle paths on roads . 
  to travel around in france , i usually take the high speed trains , and the regional trains . 
  it 's very effective and quick . 
  france is small enough for trains to be a faster means of transport than planes , considering the time to reach an airport ( which are typically in the distant suburbs of cities ) , and having to be there an hour or two earlier , whereas long distance train stations are in the center of cities and one does n't need to be there early or check out baggages and whatnot . 
  i think the government is very supportive of public transportation , and invests a lot in it . 
  and it 's a good thing . 
  my biggest complaint is that the metro system in paris closes too early ( at around 1am ) . 
  i wish at least the main axes would stay open all night . 
  and spread civilization to europe . 
  so it was a good cause , 
  i 'd also like to add that france bore most of the cost in human lives . 
  france puts its troops at risk for interventions which benefit many european ( and other ) companies who can only make a profit in a stable west africa . 
  france already pays most of the bills , and puts its own citizens in danger with ground troops , the least our allies can do is chip in a bit , which some have .

  and you know why fake news is thriving ? 
  because now you have terribly biased media ( cnn , breitbart and fox news ) combined with terrible clickbait media ( kotaku , huffpo , buzzfeed ) to scream at each other allowing fake news sites to thrive in the middle of the scream . 
  it also helps that good and real , unbiased journalism is paid journalism ( like foreign policy , the diplomat , le monde , le figaro , etc. 
  ) , which no one except loyal readers are willing to pay for . 
  fake news thrives a lot on easy access of free media . 
  much of the operations right now are being handled by the golden brigade , the pmu and the peshmerga . 
  that 's some / r/topmindsofreddit shit yo . 
  yup , they allowed corey lewandowski ( guy on trump 's payroll ) and donna brazile ( dnc head ) to work directly for cnn which violates several fcc rules . 
  that 's why reducing influence of radical islamism requires an economic solution that favours work over religion . 
  mosul 's proximity to iraqi kurdistan and iran makes it a much more important city than raqqa especially with american interests in kurdistan . 
  yup . 
  i did mention that they 're going to commit a terrorist attack in europe to distract the media from focusing on their loss in mosul . 
  i do n't know why a redditor with a swedish flair lurks / r/bulgaria . 
  um , you do know that us sofs are in mosul right ? 
  none of the spetznaz/gru are involved in mosul . 
  i lurk / r/syriancivilwar and you linking mosul to russia is absolute bs . 
  also , no on le pen . 
  fillon or bust for me . 
  yeah , but it 's just a statue of the virgin mary . 
  and besides , if i were the government i 'd also want a statue of statue of satan to be placed next to it as part of laicite . 
  sometimes laicisme can go too far . 
  the virgin mary does not dictate french law unlike burkas . 
  secularism should be against any religion that tries to dictate the law of the land or the belief of a lawgiver . 
  i do n't see the virgin mary being able to regulate french law unlike say the burka . 
  isis/daesh are losing and it 's game over once they lose mosul . 
  there 's going to be a huge terrorist attack aimed at shifting away the media 's focus on their loss at mosul . 
  they did charlie hebdo just to shift attention away from kobane and brussels aimed at shifting the attention from palmyra and they will do it this time with mosul .

  i thought they 're known for their `` sense of humor '' ? 
  it 's the result of questioning really . 
  it 's easier to lie to pollsters when they ask you `` who would you vote for this november ? '', 
  i think that polling should be a series of nuanced , complex questions that can aggregate into determining a concrete voting position on election . 
  questions like `` who is more trustworthy '' , `` who would you like to have a beer with '' and `` who do you think better represent your interest '' can result in a definite answer . 
  he tried to censor the internet and tried to make a law banning graduates from migrating outside hungary . 
  this . 
  what they should do is maybe [ reintroduce a program similar to this ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-20698098 ) where you capture `` supposed islamists '' , place them in a nice chateau near strasbourg , give them all the porn and pizzas they want and watch them divulge secrets amongst each other . 
  ali soufan did exactly that in 2002 and he was close to finding bin laden before the cia stepped in and introduced `` advanced interrogation techniques '' aka torture . 
  after trump and brexit , c'est possible . 
  for me , i 'll consider marine le pen `` winning until proven in second round '' . 
  so basically stupid hair is the visual interpretation of `` it 's just a prank bro ! '' ? 
  kinda makes sense .

  that is their job . 
  um , they do ? 
  msf has done a lot of work in syria , especially with their hospital in kobane . 
  how the fuck can you generalize that they 're doing nothing in warzones ?

  is it really hard to learn basic maritime laws when running a fucking ship ? 
  owning a ship is not like owning a car .

  it was an article about a paris office where they made post-it pictures on the windows , so nothing related to that law . 
  the guy explains that he just wanted to test if google actually reviewed the cases like they are supposed to . 
  and they do n't . 
  actually that 's true ; [ here ] ( http://rue89.nouvelobs.com/2014/07/03/droit-a-loubli-google-a-trouve-lorigine-censure-guardian-253430 ) is a french newspaper who found the guy who requested the removal of one of the guardian articles . 
  it was an article about a paris office where they made post-it pictures on the windows , so nothing related to that law . 
  the guy explains that he just wanted to test if google actually reviewed the cases like they are supposed to . 
  and they do n't . 
   the so-called `` right to be forgotten '' is mostly a craze from politics who wish to bury their mistakes , and from the paranoid luddites . 
  that law is very precise about what is included , and that does n't include accurate articles about public figures . 
  the provider must comply only if one of those conditions is fulfilled :  ( a ) the data are no longer necessary in relation to the purposes for which they were collected or otherwise processed  ( b ) the data subject withdraws consent on which the processing is based according to point ( a ) of article 6 ( 1 ) , or when the storage period consented to has expired , and where there is no other legal ground for the processing of the data ;  ( c ) the data subject objects to the processing of personal data pursuant to article 19 ; ( a ) a court or regulatory authority based in the union has ruled as final and absolute that the data concerned must be erased ;  ( d ) the data has been unlawfully processed . 
  also , if the provider do n't agree , he can refuse , in which case the requester can ask its country 's authority to review the case . 
  so basically , if the article was indeed `` factually correct '' , and contained all the up-to-date and relevant information about the case , it would n't have been removed . 
  unless google accepted it without being forced . 
  the current law does n't allow for that kind of deletion . 
  in switzerland you have to pay a full year . 
  i did n't say it was impossible , or even unlikely in a more unified europe . 
  i just said that culturally , france is very uniform . 
   france is not a culturally uniform entity it 's pretty close to that then . 
  not for the arts . 
   according to this page ( quoted at the bottom , under salaries ) . 
  that 's not including tax . 
  after tax it becomes 6.25 thousand per month which translates to 75 thousand per year . 
  thanks for that , that does seem reasonable . 
   you can very easily make it look like a lot , by including all of the benefits and excluding tax , then doing it for the whole year or their whole tenure , and you can also make it look very small by counting it for one year or one month and excluding perks and including tax . 
  yes , but in the end the net monthly ( or yearly ) salary is difficult to falsify , and easily understandable . 
  unless there are more professional expenses that they need to pay themselves too , or some perks ( like a car ) . 
   an mep earning 40 thousand euros a year does n't sound that extravagant indeed it does n't , that 's quite low actually . 
  where did you get that number though ? 
  to be honest i 'm a bit lost with the numbers provided in that thread in general , people throw around salaries from $ 30k to $ 200k a year ; and my german is schlecht .

  you might argue that other languages than english come from a translation of the script ( which is n't always true as the author is n't always american ) , but then dubbing vs subtitling make no difference . 
  the english voices are no more original than any others . 
  it 's not like the `` actors '' have original voices , they 're drawn . 
  in french at least they do a really good job and you ca n't see anything really . 
  not just the simpsons , but most cartoons . 
  even for movies it 's incredibly good . 
   france experiences `` multicultural collapse '' due to the failure to assimilate immigrants from france 's former african colonies , resulting in the creation of an `` arab piedmont '' in the south east . 
  with english dubbing i guess . 
  the simpsons are dubbed in any language . 
  it 's a cartoon . 
  edit : what i mean is that the `` actor '' do n't have an original voice . 
  even the english version is people dubbing it . 
  the simpson 's spanish voice is n't less original than the english one . 
  it depends where you go i imagine . 
  i went to barcelona and found that many people spoke decent english , but then i got to northern spain ( cantabria , asturias ... ) and english was almost worthless there , even with young people ( university students ) . 
  even hotel receptionists did n't speak a word of english sometimes . 
  i had to go with my broken spanish ( which is fair i guess ) . 
  ps : those northern regions are lovely btw . 
  pence is plural . 
  france , belgium , the netherlands ... even finland to an extent . 
  obviously , i do n't mean to say that they 're exactly the same , that they have the same trade and type of industry . 
  i mean to say that they have ( and have had for a long time ) a very similar standard of living , gdp per capita , general level of development , healthcare ... for the last decades , it has n't been a drastic change of living ( economically or socially , not culturally ) to move between those countries . 
  germany is the obvious counter-example , but just as much as italy or spain . 
  some did better , some did worse , and it does n't look clear whether the uk would have gone the way of spain or germany . 
  chances are it would have gone similarly . 
  i know it 's not a sound and scientific study , there 's no point arguing on the details . 
  it 's more a very general remark why i 'm not convinced of the effect you take for granted . 
  and it 's not like `` having had an awful labour government for 13 years '' is a very scientific base either . 
  we 're talking broad picture and feeling , and that 's fine . 
  i really do n't find it that obvious . 
  it 's not like every other country have been praising its government the whole time . 
  if you look at the broad picture , it does n't look like euro vs pound made much difference for the uk . 
  it 's not doing much better or worse than economically equivalent countries . 
  in the end , i think the effect of a single currency area on the continent was n't too different for any country close to or inside the eurozone . 
  this money has affected ( for better or worse , that 's not the point ) the whole continent . 
  the uk 's economy is completely linked to the rest of the eu , and the rest of the eu is just as well linked to the uk . 
  that 's why i 'm unsure about a uk leaving . 
  in a way it might unlock some decisions , but in another it would n't be good ( for both the uk and the rest of the eu ) to have reduced trade . 
   juncker is a euro-federalist . 
  that basically means more power to the eu , more integration , more of everything . 
  that is very adverse to most of the british position , who seem to want a lot of repatriation of powers , means transfer of sovereignty back to individual countries . 
  i do n't see how schulz or verhofstad would be less europhile . 
  it 's not that clear really . 
  the eurozone is 18 countries , only a bunch have seen problems with that crisis . 
  the uk is n't doing better than eurozone countries with equivalent development and wealth . 
  and nobody sees p\u00e9tain in a good light in france . 
  it 's more than that . 
  they also propose a mix of strong state , strong police force ( `` assumed legitimate defense for the police '' ) , forbidden protests on some topics ( like support for illegal immigrants ) , `` zero tolerance '' in schools , `` zero tolerance '' on anything illegal , extended prison sentences , guaranteed full life sentences , death penalty . 
  they also proposed to have the victims families able to take part in the judgement after a crime . 
  they also used to be against abortion , but i ca n't find it in their program anymore . 
   edit : also , the fn is known to not vote/participate in the eu parliament . 
  i do n't expect this to change . 
  one aspect i see is that in 2017 , at the next presidential election , the fn should n't be able to complain about the eu 's actions anymore , since they are the first french party to control it . 
  but i know it 's not going to work out that way , their debates are never based on facts anyway . 
  the fn are not neo-nazis . 
  i hate them , but they 're not neo-nazis . 
  it 's more a relative satisfaction of the status quo compared to alternatives . 
  the `` best '' universities to consider heavily depend on what you 'll be studying . 
  they want france to leave the eu and be ruled by a king , who would be above the constitution , above the parliament . 
  they are not clear on the type of monarchy . 
  they want a christian king apparently , but they 're really vague about the actual laws that they would support for such a regime . 
  actually they 're really vague in the whole program . 
  they want a `` communitarian preference '' ( apparently that means taxes on both french and european importations ) , `` surveillance of the territory '' , and `` preservation of the shared natural patrimony '' . 
  they also want to modify the `` european treaties '' to include the `` christian roots '' . 
  they say that 80 % of the french laws come from brussels , and the usual other anti-eu lies ( the dimensions of vegetables , regulations on cheese making , are mentionned in their program ) . 
  they also want to forbid abortion . 
  honestly that 's not very clear , even after reading the whole website . 
  they mostly complain about politics in france and the eu , and present the royalty as an ideal solution .

oh no , sorry by `` pure '' , i did n't mean `` white '' or exclusively `` greek , '' i just meant to keep free of troublemakers . 
  sorry english is my 2nd language . 
   greece will not sell there country out like sweden , if blood has to be spilled than it will flow . 
  europe needs more greeks . 
  you guys sound like heroes . 
  proud and ready to fight . 
  keep your country pure . 
  i meant riots against non-muslims . 
  muslims regularly ( usually fridays after prayers ) riot in christian areas of the middle east and attack churches and businesses owned by christians . 
  yes true . 
  but if you put aside that , at the end of the day the jesus message is completely different than the mohammad message . 
  while i am no fan of catholicism , i think that there is a large difference between the character of jesus , a poor , peaceful , celibate and humble man with no land or army , and the character of mohammad , a warlord intent on conquest who bedded a 9 year old . 
  even if one does n't believe that these characters existed , there is still a large difference between them . 
   why are the islamic people going crazy ? 
  while all of the rioting and attacks from muslims is new to europe , it is not new to the rest of the world . 
  ask any minority from the middle east or india and they 'll tell you that this has been happening for 1500 years . 
  islam is a religion made to conquer ( the ultimate goal is to wage jihad against all the infidels and take over the world ) . 
  their prophet was a bloody warlord . 
  that 's their inspiration . 
  they 're not getting crazy , they 've always been crazy , it 's just that as their populations grow they feel more confident to assert their dominance . 
  this is the non-pc truth and i 'll probably get downvoted to hell for it . 
  a population of less than 3 % muslim like in ireland and the us is small enough that they will not make trouble but once they get closer to 10 % like in france and sweden , they get more confident ; they start forming ghettos , asserting their dominance and their law on it ( `` no-go zones '' ) which slowly degenerate into pocket of shit that look like the the middle east . 
  the streets of european cities are becoming more and more dangerous for young women as the coming of muslims has soared rape rates as well as other crime rates ( did you see that video of that young woman walking down the street in 25 % muslim brussels , it looked like she 'd be safer walking down the streets of cairo ) . 
  and if you think this is bad , wait till the baby boomers die off and all of a sudden , the muslim population becomes instead of 10 % -  25 % + . 
  you 'll wish you could get a visa to canada/us . 
  all the meanwhile , the european politicians and most europeans sit back completely clueless with no dignity as their country is being taken over by islamic colonialists who are outbreeding them like crazy and the liberal states they fought so hard to build have become a joke to the world as rape rates , fgm , rioting , etc. 
  soar . 
  hispanic is a race . 
  islam is not . 
  i am free to criticize islam as much as i like just as i am free to criticize nazism and communism because they are all ideologies . 
  on that note , why do n't you consider opposition to nazism racism towards germans ? 
  hispanics integrate and become pretty much american by the 2nd or 3rd generation at most . 
  if the us becomes 50 % hispanic , it wo n't change too much really other than more mexican restaurant . 
  in europe however , integration decreases per generation ... 
  airports and train stations usually . 
  i do n't think the guns are actually loaded but the ammunition is nearby . 
   funny thing you brought that up , actually . 
  since you 're obviously a right-wing nutter from another country , who does n't know anything about sweden , i 'll link you the english article about the gang `` og '' [ 1 ] . 
  founded by assyrians and now consisting of all kinds of ethnicities and religions . 
  and these are really bad people . 
  they do worse stuff than burning cars . 
  according to your link the gang was formed by an assyrian . 
  that 's it , the rest of the members are europeans and immigrants . 
  calling it assyrian is a joke . 
  its members do n't go around killing people in the name of syriac orthodoxy , idiot , that 's the difference aside from the fact that 's far more heterogeneous then your riot gangs which are 95-99 % muslim . 
   swedish youth gangs , the type you lot in other countries like to write about , consist of all types of people , as i 've said . 
  you 're firmer assertion does not make you 're claims true , and the onus is on you to prove them . 
  but you can agree they 're 99 % muslim , right ? 
  or are delusional ? 
   use the expression `` allahu akbar '' as well . 
  even though they are christians . 
  `` allahu akbar '' is exclusively a muslim term . 
   but all this is beside the point . 
  youth gangs in sweden are not the religious extremists . 
  we have religious extremists , and a fare share of muslim ones . 
  those are , however , not the ones burning cars . 
  they do other things , of which i do not approve . 
  i agree that the ones burning are not all necesarily the bearded white robes type but that 's who gives them their inspiration . 
  they teach them to hate swedes , treat swedish girls as inferior sluts , etc. 
   i would never have the stomach to compare genocides to win an argument over you on the internet . 
  why are you so obsessed with spreading lies about muslims ? 
  why are you trying to make up a conflict ? 
  you are spreading hatred , and i hope , for the sake of humanity , that you change your ways . 
  answer this genius , who is more in danger in the mena , a muslim or a christian ? 
  holy fuck if your type represents even 10 % of swedes then i can imagine why your country went from a haven to a shithole with one of the highest rape rates in the world . 
   you have some balls to tell me what 's going on in my country . 
  i do my best seeing as your media and politicians censor the information you get . 
   i would like to see a source for this . 
  anyone , who is not a anti-islamic french muslim-baiter who has never set foot in sweden , knows that ronna , or even s\u00f6dert\u00e4lje as a whole , is not a nice place to live in . 
  anyone with any sort of experience in sweden would also know that youth gangs in sweden often feature both christians , such as assyrians , and muslims , from the middle east . 
  and that the assyrian / `` syrianska '' community has huge problems with force marriages and mega fights between families . 
  are there any riots in the assyrian neighborhood ? 
  do you have nay proof that assyrians are rioting ? 
  do you have any proof they also join the same gangs ? 
  i highly doubt what you are saying is true . 
  it does n't make any sense . 
  swedish `` youth '' gangs are composed of mena muslims , somali muslims and afghani muslims . 
  they usually yell religious slogans ( `` allahu akbar '' ) , allude to `` the war against muslims '' for their hate against swedes and often make statements with heavy islamic tone . 
  i really do n't see why an assyrian ( who just fucking fled from muslims ) would join these groups . 
  assyrians do n't even consider themselves arab and have their own languages . 
  if you really think christians in the mena are n't way more oppressed than muslims , then you should go fuck off . 
  the christian population in the mena has gone from 20 % in the 1900s to 4 % today . 
  there have been ethnically cleansed . 
  every week in iraq , a church is blown up , a christian family is butchered , etc. 
  simply because they are chrisitians . 
  swedes and assyrians do not go nor subscribe to the same churches . 
  swedes are protestant and barely go to church anyways . 
  assyrians are orthodox . 
  their churches are not in communion at all with neither catholic nor protestant churches . 
  that ca n't at all be the reason they succeed so well . 
  assyrians are exclusively christian . 
  i just think that it is interesting that two groups ( mena christians and muslims ) from the same region can be so different solely due to their religious affiliation . 
  i 'm not saying their christianity is the reason for their success but it points out to how big of a factor islam plays in the trouble of muslim immigrants to integrate into european society . 
  middle eastern jews also have high success rates in europe . 
  thus , it seems islam and not culture nor ethnicity that is the root of the problem otherwise assyrians would be just as bad as muslims which is n't true . 
  in fact , they 're very successful and valuable to swedish society . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/assyrians/syriacs_in_sweden do you disagree with this statement ? 
  interestingly enough , christian immigrants from the middle east are much more successful . 
  yes , there is nothing wrong with having a refugee system because some people do need and deserve it . 
  in sweden , assyrian christians ( christians from syria , turkey , iraq , etc. ),

  history happens . 
  the situation is not healthy and has to evolve for sure . 
  taxi licenses are free . 
  the number of issued licenses are limited because taxis themselves demanded it to avoid flooding the market with drivers and lowering prices . 
  the expensive license price is the result of taxis own speculation when they resell their licenses . 
  really , taxis complaint about uber are somewhat legitimate , but their shitty situation is their own doing . 
  i 'm do n't personally agree with uber 's attitude as well . 
  tsipras said it will give greece a better position in negotiations . 
  more a legitimacy in saying `` fuck you '' to the ez . 
  there will be decisions to be made by each party : - how does greece decides to handle its liquidity problem ? 
  if the ecb refuses to provide euros , it 's a de facto exclusion from the ez and greece will have to issue drachma sooner rather than later . 
  if the ecb provides euros , there 's probably negociations going on . 
  - how do creditors handle the greek default ? 
  do they write off the money as lost , or do they attempt last minute negotiations to mitigate the damages ? 
  at this point does greece even want to negociate ? 
  markets want stability and reliability , not show of power . 
  i do n't really know the legal possibilities and ramifications . 
  i think uber plans on complaining to the european commission about the taxi monopoly and ask that france be forced to liberalize the sector . 
  several years of legal battles . 
  more realistically there will probably be a law to legalize and organize the activity somehow , and make a distinction between uber-style transportation and taxis . 
  steps in this direction have already been taken . 
  from what i understand , uber has professional drivers that are perfectly legal , and casual drivers that just use the uberpop platform to get in relation with people needing a lift . 
  these casual drivers are not salaried by uber and pay them a fee . 
  they do n't pay any taxes and do n't get any state benefit over this activity . 
  it 's basically under the table work , with uber making a profit , which is illegal . 
  undeclared employment . 
  greece can live without the euro . 
  can the euro survive a country leaving it ? 
  yeah , it 's probably gon na be messy , but that 's what the institutions should say nevertheless . 
  because it 's the greek opposition job to do so . 
  european institutions should not go one step further than `` we acknowledge that greece will have a referendum , even if we hoped it did n't come to that , and hope that whatever the result is we will all handle the consequences calmly and orderly . '', 
  * please respond ... *, 
  he is n't trying to save greece . 
  he is trying to save the euro . 
  so if a country is in trouble , it gets money on the condition that it accepts to implement a list of reform dictated by the ez ? 
  where have i seen this before and why do i have the feeling it 's only going to make things worse ? 
  now we 're talking . 
  there 's a lot more ramification with the rest of the world watching the shitshow go down and themselves taking measures against the ez/eu due to instability and loss of credibility . 
  also the rest of the european people that will have to make their mind on if they are ok with this kind of europe or if they want out . 
  i 'm a lot less certain than you that greece wo n't issue euros , but thank you for entertaining the thought and answering . 
  thousands of company or small business owners that ask tens of thousands of mid-level managers to train millions of retail and restaurants workers . 
  that 's assuming all these people involved , particularly those handling the cash actually care about the issue and remember to check . 
  what if you pay the restaurant or bar by leaving cash on the table and no one has time to check before you leave ? 
  there are bound to be * a lot * if not most of greek euros that wo n't be screened and refused . 
  and if each country central bank threatens to refuse business owners that try to cash in greek issued euros , that will mean losses for the businesses . 
  probably not enough to make a real difference , so they wo n't even bother to check anyway . 
  and if business owners ca n't cash in their greek issued euros , it does n't mean it wo n't keep circulating in the local economy . 
  there is no realistic scenario in which greek issued euros wo n't be absorbed by the ez and accepted as valid currency . 
  your candor is refreshing . 
  such as ? 
  the person at the gas station or the supermarket thousands of km away and not really up-to-date with the drama is going to check the serial number ? 
  what happens when a greek crosses the border and uses his euros outside of the country ? 
  what happens to the tourist who pays for something in `` valid '' euros and gets the change in `` invalid '' euros ? 
  so what ? 
  counterfeit because the rest of the ez says it is ? 
  what happens then ? 
  when millions of supposedly counterfeit euros are injected in the economy and start circulating on a local level to sustain the economy ? 
  what if it crosses borders ? 
  people , instead of saying greece ca n't print euros , stop the denial and answer the question : what if they do ? 
  greek government is well within their right to ask or force the bank of greece to print euros if the ecb refuses to provide liquidity . 
  it 's not economy at this point , it 's pure politic . 
  so speculation , that 's what i thought . 
  we do n't know that yet . 
  greece very much wants to stay even in the eventuality of a no . 
  do you have insider info on how the ez plans to kick greece out ? 
  but at least it gives greece freedom to choose its future independently from policies dictated by other countries . 
  short term mess , long term sustainability vs long term mess . 
  [ +324 ] obama clearly does n't know his economic basics . 
  [ +812 ] did nobody tell obama that it was the corrupt and lazy greeks fault and their incompetent governments that their in this mess and they deserve anything that comes to them ? 
  [ +274 ] the us should pay for the debt then !!, 
  [ +93 ] that 's nice and all but maybe he could have said it sooner . 
  [ -40 ] you see , if even obama says so ... [ -228 ] obama , one guy with more sense than the entire eurozone combined . 
  i do n't know about the intolerance of the refugees , but what about the intolerance of the school ? 
  it 's slut shaming by the school as clear as it comes and the refugees are just the perfect excuse to blame it on arabs . 
  remember folks , feminism is important for burka-wearing women in saudi arabia . 
  not europe , no sir . 
  saudi arabia . 
  we tend to get downvoted to hell on / r/europe , so i guess most of us just shut up because we are clearly unwelcome . 
  [ another thread you might be interested in . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3bb60k/lets_assume_greece_denies_the_austerity_measures/ ), 
   the capable people already have well-paid jobs . 
  well the obvious one is cutting the ecb liquidity to greek banks as they did to cyprus not to long ago . 
  no more money at the atm , forcing the greek governement to either ask its central bank to issue euros or drachma . 
  if they choose euros the eurozone will probably say they do n't have the right and at this point its greece vs the eurozone battling to see who can violate the more treaties to save their own skin . 
  if they choose drachma , it 's a de facto exclusion of greece from the eurozone , which ca n't be legally done without exiting the eu , so we 'll so how that goes ... they could also unilaterally revoke agreements previously made with greece , putting it in an even more difficult position . 
  declare greece persona non grata and decide what could be a kind of embargo on the country , cutting it 's supply on essentials until it accepts the eurogroup proposal . 
  really , i have no doubt they would be very imaginative and are planning what to do right now . 
  you mean that the 25 % unemployment rate in greece means that a quarter of the active population are good-for-nothings ? 
  and that those who do n't have well-paid jobs are are incapable ? 
  they 'll be happy to hear that . 
  they violate the treaties when it suits them , as they did several times to save greece actually . 
  violating the treaties to take measures against greece is a very natural option for them . 
  it 's not like refusing the proposal means an immediate positive for greece . 
  it just mean that the greeks wo n't accept austerity measures for the bailout money . 
  that 's all . 
  people tend to forget that the creditors accept the risk of a default when they loan money . 
  that 's why there 's an interest rate . 
  you ca n't ask for an interest rate and then come whining when the people you loaned to ca n't reimburse . 
  you played and you lost . 
  if the no wins , it just means that the troika has to come up with something else then austerity measures if they want to see their money back ( and do n't forget that what we see here is essentially the imf transfering to the ecb and vice versa , pure banking footnotes , the greeks never see that money ) .

  i was being a tad facetious . 
  yea , everybody should vote, 
  just so everyone 's clear : the vote of the slovak is more powerful than the vote of the french or german . 
  so , why did you waste your beefed up power vote ? 
  edit : this may be inappropriate , but i 'm genuinely angry at the people in small countries with low voter turnout . 
  this whole europe thing , needs just ** a little itty bitty bit ** of your attention and time ... 
  step one : ** find your political orientation !, 
  ** are you a communist ? 
  a fascist ? 
  a moderate conservative ? 
  a true centrist ? 
  a moderate centre-lefty ? 
  or are you a totalitarian/monarchist/theocrat ? 
  if you do n't know what those words mean * google it * step two : ** figure out who represents your political orientation !, 
  ** keep in mind that sometimes people vote for a party that has a really revolutionary idea or strategy that they like , but otherwise they disagree with the party 's political orientation . 
  step three : ** vote ** step four : watch your children and children 's children ** flourish in a strong , united , egalitarian europe . 
  i hate julian assange . 
  he tries to pretend like he cares about afghans privacy , he does n't give a shit he wanted to be back in the limelight that snowden and greenwald `` stole '' from him . 
  also he took advantage of and manipulated a psychologically vulnerable chelsea manning . 
  does n't their leader want to cut every mans penis off to promote egalitarianism ? 
   cracovians no way that 's what they 're called ?!, 
  super sexy name , i thought they were krakowska or something, 
  how offensive , everyone knows that the primary dutch speaking country is glorious aruba :p, 
  the correct format is english - jamaica flag portuguese - angola flag spanish - guatemala flag french - cameroon flag german - liechtenstein flag italian - san marino flag, 
  unless you vote for who i tell you to vote for  ... otherwise yea , i geuss . 
  the problem is those people are * always * the most vocal and passionate and vote for communists and fascists and theocrats and such, 
   scotsch, 
  or theocracy, 
  no , it means you are a genocidal totalitarian terrorist . 
  examples : hitler and stalin [ political circle ] ( http://i.imgur.com/pvzj6wf.jpg ), 
  if you are an intelligence , well-read , rational and empathic person , you have a duty to vote . 
  for a person of this type , not voting is a grave disservice to both their country and europe . 
  are ... are you guys having a ` post-war germany ' moment but with political dysfunction and populism instead of jew-killing and poland-invading ?? 
  has italy been so scarred by berlusconi and so terrified by grillo that the trauma has left an permanent mark on their national psyche : never again will the italian people vote a shit-head into office ?? 
  i hope so . 
  edit : gerrunds, 
  i do n't live there , and it 's not that bad ... 
  but paris has a culture of discourteousness . 
  which is not a terrible thing for most people , i just prefer living in a smallish village where people are friendlier and you have more privacy . 
  edit : you see , i make a valid criticism of paris and i get downvotes . 
  that 's the shenanigans i 'm talking about - they are n't evil sociopaths ... 
  but they are generally dicks . 
  normal people who are dicks . 
  ( of course once of get to know them , you are like family and they are very warm , so i give them that . ), 
  ... ... that 's still better treatment than i get in paris . 
  it means that a single latvian mep could be very important and influential - especially if he 's charismatic , clever and motivated . 
  therefore you 're vote was not wasted because it contributed to someone that 's going to brussels , representing you and people like you more accurately . 
  also you have a duty to vote . 
  it is an obligation we all have to 1 ) our country and 2 ) europe, 
   `` a single grain of rice can tip the scale '' i was actually serious when i commented that initially, 
  not * everyone * in france acts like a sassy as fuck parisien i 've been to qu\u00e9bec many , many times . 
  specifically a resort on lac saint-stanislas , were you can rent snowmobiles , which i fucking love by the way . 
  this was a family affair in my childhood . 
  * been to la mauricie * mont-tremblant too * and obviously montr\u00e9al * i love cirque du soleil aaand bonus : i 've been down to louisiana , specifically to cajun country solely because i wanted to experience their culture , which i found to be extremely charming ... 
  holy snap , guy . 
  i was just being playful ... 
  hopefully not . 
  maybe we need to make it a reality ... 
  i mean there are definitely regions that share an identity - nordics , baltics , west slavs , balkans , greece & cyprus , the latins , the germanic continentals ( netherlands , germans , austrians , flanders , luxembourg ) and honestly , i think all western europeans have a lot in common historically , and i mean recent history . 
  i mean i personally feel `` western '' so members of `` the west '' sort of have a common identity that is indeed rooted in culture and politics and values . 
  iirc one of the expectations was that the eastern europeans would adopt western values ( because , let 's be honest , they 're the most advanced set of values mankind has ever known ), 
   eurosceptic party won 4 % . 
  that 's good to hear , i was worried about romania ( and bulgaria ) . 
  i thought they be a bit anti-eu because they have been `` verbally abused '' in the past 12 months, 
   there is no european identity there is no european identity blahblahblah blah i 'm so sick of people saying there 's no european identity . 
  people need to get over the ethnic shit and recognize that we need to stay together , improve the union and move forward, 
  or the effects of heavy immigration from both the former global empires and the migrants from eastern europe have combined to freak the shit out of the working classes ( even though the problem is n't as big as they think , it 's easy to influence them that it is because working classes are more likely to have these people as coworkers or neighbors ) but honestly , i 've been trying to think about what connects france and england . 
  i mean there is a long history , but the culture and politics are still quite different . 
  i really suspect it might be some sort of subconscious imperial pride left over from when we ruled the planet ... maybe subconsciously the english and the french believe they can regain their former glory , but it 's the eu that 's holding us back ... something like `` we ruled the fucking world , and then those bloody europeans ( ! ), 
  came in and fucked everything up , they are so incompetent !, 
  most of them never even had a single colony ! '', 
  i 'm pulling this all out of my ass , but i 'm sure freud would have agreed with me, 
  fyi the us just banned antibiotics for their meat and there is a strong movement to reform the meat industry . 
  also , i stopped reading at gmos , because gmophobia is bs, 
  i did n't mean to offend , but weird things can happen . 
  for example , nobody foresaw the collapse of communism in 1988 ... 
  but it did explode all of a sudden no one foresaw 9/11 , but it happened and america went insane with paranoia and changed the world forever no one foresaw the 2008 financial armageddon , but it happened and all of sudden greece was just an inch away from elected an actual , hardcore neo-nazi party into power . 
  no one foresaw euromaidan and certainly no one foresaw russia invading and annexing sovereign ukrainian territory . 
  * crazy shit happens , especially in europe , and we need something powerful to bind us together and neutralize each others madness . 
  oh , i thought it was farage . 
  lulz , that is too optimistic an outlook . . 
  here 's a secret : the eu works * because it economically intertwines our fates * ( yes yes it 's a double edged sword ... 
  but one edge is a lot sharper than the other ), 
  espagne , portugal and italie chose moderation !, 
  the latins still have some sense !, 
  some good news , * almost * makes up for france 's fuck-up ( keyword : almost ) ... . edit : does anyone know how our psychologically disturbed ( near russia syndrome ) little brother , roumanie , has done ? 
  i understand that , for a very long time france concentrated her entire european fleet in the mediterranean with the assumption that britain would protect her atlantic coast . 
  but like i said , conflict can and do snowball . 
  i mean , what about poland ? 
  poland could get taken by the far right and then take slovakia , czech , hungary , romania ... nato ( mainly the usa ) would probably not intervene , because the americans love the polish , and prefer them to all other eastern european states . 
  but then russia would intervene ... and then russia would become a superpower again and * then * the americans would intervene ... and would pressure the british to intervene ... and then so and so forth , the conflict inevitably snowballs into a fucking hell for everyone . 
  i 'm of the opinion that we have no choice but to remain united , fuck could you imagine a far right party rising in some place like hungary going to war with slovakia to `` liberate '' the land it lost in the treaty of trianon ? 
  because shit like that * would * happen . 
  edit : and then that conflict would `` snowball '' ... like it * always * does . . 
  umm they are if you 're french they need help to keep the anglo-saxon hordes at bay , 
   all these votes went to centre and left wing wow , the protest votes were * centrist * and * progressive * !? 
  did you tell them they 're not casting votes for latvia , they 're casting votes for europe ? 
  as the emperor of china said in disney 's * mulan *  `` a single grain of rice can tip the scale '', 
  ah , that 's good to hear . 
  i mean , it 's better than getting bat shit crazies elected into power,

if people stopped using adblock for every fucking website and actually made a white list , there would be no problem . 
  they 're too lazy to switch tabs when an ad appears on youtube . 
  they ca n't make a whitelist . 
  surprise surprise , despite what a lot of people seem to have told you , minorities do find important jobs . 
  you can live in paris and talk something else than french . 
  point being that just like 99 % of france 's shitty politicians are still relevant in mediums or occupying a power position , he is, 
   i knew french hates the turks ?? 
  france and turkey have a long history of collaborating with each other you know ? 
  also french communities and turkish ones are common in both countries . 
  i was making a point that several countries sell weapons without a legit reason and was mocking my prime minister who has been saying bullshit over bullshit for the past year . 
  maybe follow . 
  as a frenchman , i 'm actually waiting the moment my dumb prime minister will claim that selling weapons to turkey , that then sells them to terrorist groups targeting france and french troops in middle east and africa protects france . 
  i really wonder how you can be so stupid . 
  for somebody to not understand banning a clothing wo n't change anything about a culture 's root , it shows a great lack of education and a lack of knowledge about civilizations to begin with . 
  knowledge you get at school while taking history lessons . 
  and talking about fucking temperatures about clothings is just as stupid . 
  i wear heavy clothings even in summer when i want to , should it be forbidden ? 
  of course not . 
  if you wanted to commit a crime you 'd have a mask anyway . 
  that 's how it has always been . 
  itt : people who do n't understand how oppression works and that removing clothings wo n't make the problem disappear ; also itt people who do n't understand their govt is only doing it to distract them . 
  it 's hilarious, 
  `` we 're talking about meat here , so i 'm here to talk about the virtues of cheese gentlemen '', 
   on another note if you cant work out how impractical , opressive and just plain stupid it is to wear those styles of clothing outside every day , especially in 35 \u00b0 c/95 f in the sun , nobody can help you . 
  if you ca n't see how impractical , opressive and just plain stupid it is to forbid wearing those styles of clothing , nobody can help you . 
   you have no ground to say the opposite , while the other side has a few well known factors . 
  we 're talking about european countries in which immigrant youth is flourishing thanks to education and self-awareness . 
  what about you thought that maybe they are n't as dumb as you think they are ? 
   i have a hard time believing there 's an overwhelming amount of educated women that would naturally enjoy wearing what those things represent . 
  you can be educated and dismiss a symbol by wearing it if you want to and not wearing it if you do n't want to . 
   it 's more like the burqa is a symbol of women slavery and there 's no place for that in a modern society . 
  what if you let people defy this `` symbol '' by wearing said symbol freely , hmm ? 
  as long as i do n't say stupid things , it 's okay . 
  you should do the same . 
  but seeing your post history , you ca n't . 
  stupidity is n't allowed in people 's house , that 's his point . 
  you might have supported trump , but supporting him * now * is the single most efficient proof of stupidity mankind ever came up with . 
  you could shoot yourself in the feet and you 'd appear more sane than if you support trump . 
  because trump is shooting holes the size of meteors in his own country . 
  seeing you using the term `` weaboos '' , which is demeaning and misused pushes me to think the contrary though . 
  that 's not very smart to talk badly of another culture without knowing it . 
  the one with cl\u00e9op\u00e2tre was a masterpiece of humor though . 
  if you 're talking about * ast\u00e9rix & ob\u00e9lix xxl 2 : mission las vegum * , i loved that game . 
  it was so good for its time . 
  if i ever find this game on the net , i 'll play the shit out of it . 
  i do n't even understand how they managed to make such a smart game at this time . 
  if muteahhit is the name of the guy seeking the heroes ' help , then he actually is an architect in the original comics . 
  you should actually read manga , strange hair styles are uncommon most of the time . 
  so you 're worried that a civilization that has been a minority and made a scapegoat for dozens of years in europe might one day become a majority and have a lot of power , but at no point you think that you should work on changing the policies concerning those people so that bad things do n't happen ???????? 
  that 's exactly what creates problems . 
  by islamists you either think people who magically enough , can do well without them being attacked if you educate them ; or the terrorists who do n't magically happen or come live here ? 
  they do n't live in europe , they get converted in europe because of racism , xenophobia , and islamophobia , which strangely enough , is n't something muslims themselves hold much power about . 
  surprise surprise , the country has a role and responsabilities . 
  stop shifting roles onto people who do n't have any power and are victims , that 's how you create even more racism and xenophobia . 
  also , you people need to fucking realize that the religion = / = sharia law or whatever . 
  that 's being desillusional . 
  then is he somehow trying to advocate to kill you for not being one or anything like that ? 
  :d that would be surprising , right ? 
  contradicting everything you 're trying to accomplish . 
  i think you should talk with people who actually live by this religion since you 're unable to think for yourself with logic in mind . 
   but i worry about 20 % muslim populations somehow democratically banning free speech and allowing in even more muslims , funding mosques with tax money , those are very scary things for me considering i believe the quran teachings are dangerous and can be interpreted to hate and deceive/kill non-believes and polytheists . 
  you 're aware that this whole portion of your post is basically you not realizing that those things are false/can be avoided by simply not being afraid ? 
  they wo n't come and vote so that rape becomes legal , nor will they take tax moneys for religion , because oh surprise , it 's fucking forbidden . 
  and the quran 's teachings in themselves are n't bad if you even knew the 5 islam pillars . 
  stop being afraid of ghosts in the dark and light up your goddamn torch . 
  if you actually knew what you were talking about , you 'd know the one part you 're talking about says that in case of attack , it 's ok to kill to defend your life , but that attacking other people is n't ok . 
  i think you need to take a look at a history book , because this is nothing but the start of what happened in 1930s, 
  sorry to burst your bubble , but for years , france refused to take anybody ( if we 're talking about refugees ) . 
  there was no `` invasion '' like they like to talk about it , just fake informations . 
  also , there is no `` forced colonization '' , and do n't expect of me to defend racist people . 
  they 're the problem in our country and the reason politicians can take away each of our liberties and hard-earned rights one by one . 
  france is finally doing something to help a few people and suddenly it 's `` a forced colonization '' ? 
  when they beat up migrants and forced them to leave , or even denied them the right to go to england for no legal reason ? 
  when they let other countries take thousands in all the while saying `` if france take even one our whole economy will crumble , believe me '' ? 
  sorry but i do n't buy that bullshit , i 'm not 8 anymore , unlike many people , and i 'm more focused on the billions of euros our politicians are stealing for themselves every year  too bad a lot of people are too dumb to understand that those are the real problems , and not the fact that some people decided to come in our country . 
  edit : i just read some of your previous posts . 
  i do n't want to have anything to do with somebody who thinks black people are genetically inferior to white people because he decided so . 
  have a fun day . 
  the us is the land where everything is big and the same . 
  is that better ? 
  or do i have to remind you on what values the us are based and why people went to live there ? 
  the usa are the biggest strawman of the world . 
  built on strawman , and raised on strawman , moulded by it . 
  did you read my post or not ? 
  i said `` the last 4 acts of terrorism ( not on a large scale ) '' , meaning that i 'm talking about * terrorism * and not just `` big scale attack '' terrorism . 
  kkk did terrorism , but if i tell you `` terrorism '' you 'll think 9/11 , not `` killed 5 black people '' . 
  do n't you think that the race might be one of the biggest influence of one 's socioeconomic status ? 
  because that 's basically everything that history classes tell us about racism , i 'd be surprised if it was n't the same in the us , especially seeing 2014 and 2015 . 
  dear neighbour , my country is also under invasion !, 
  all i see are people who are not exactly like me !, 
  send help as a token of friendship , there are people who are n't white and catholics here !, 
  french person here , the last 4 acts of terrorism ( not on a large scale ) were made by people attacking migrants/burning centers made to host them . 
  the only thing that 's putting people in danger here are stupid racist people . 
  asian culture revolves around education . 
  education -  money , education -  social life , education -  good member of society . 
  and since it 's mostly recent migration , they do n't have their history of being discriminated . 
  they come to study and work and people do n't bother them because they just arrived and have no history of being a problem to the society . 
  they are partially due to discrimination , yes . 
  as a french person , how the hell do you think they get more soldiers from fucking * france * after those attacks ? 
  why do you think they attacked france , which is on the bottom of their * publicly shared hit-list * ?

  this is so true . 
  that 's obvously not how we see thing despite why the leftist roaming here will tell you . 
  otherwise you would not get 44 % of france voting for mlp/fillon . 
  you have me wondering !, 
  why are you copying my taunt ? 
  you ca n't make up taunt yourself , beside plain insult ? 
  there is no imagination in that little peace of german brain ? 
  at least you were somewhat entertaining , i 'll give you that . 
  but now you are just german style boring . 
  i do n't need to grant more time to some parrot . 
  i 'll just block your little bitchy mouth . 
  natural selection is taking it 's time recently, 
  the peace and love hippy bullshit died 40 years ago . 
  there is a reason why they did n't last in this world . 
  i 'm not your buddy , and considering how retarded your post are , germany does n't deserve that capital letter . 
   ho is openly against gay-marriage . 
  it seems you are capable of reading , so i 'll give you that peace of advice . 
  read his program before talking , because that 's not what is written in it . 
  it 'll make you look a bit less like a moron . 
  the only things getting hurt when you post are english language and german national pride . 
  now if you talk about people needing education , maybe you should start by spelling `` piece '' properly . 
  i know you ca n't make much sence to anything , so i 'll make it accessible even for someone like you . 
  some people ** value ** economic reform more than integrity . 
  regardless , your insulting tone over people supporting someone that has yet to be proven guilty is despicable . 
  shitting on the presumption of innonce and the state of law makes you an even bigger scumbag than him . 
  to finish it 's `` piece '' , not `` peace '' . 
  that moment when french correct your english ... 
  i 'm not talking about the parody of election they had . 
  technicaly , china and russia are democracy too . 
  i do n't think , i know . 
  you do n't know what you are talking about . 
  people hate rich and their capital . 
  they do n't understand that capital finance investment . 
  withouth it , we would still be in middle age . 
  well no fucking shit , he did n't list the whole dictator squad . 
  castro and chavez are enough for me . 
  i said ,  anybody mentioning fillon or le pen would be at minus 30 . 
  c. that 's what we did . 
  stop being salty or come get the last one yourself . 
  except republican dont want to leave europe so dupont isnt a viable alternative, 
  except republican dont want to leave europe so dupont isnt a viable alternative, 
  you are insulting people for valuing different thing than you . 
  how mentaly retarded is that ? 
  are u under drugs ? 
  are u under drugs ? 
  you think bridges are financed with the worker 's bank account ? 
   high tax bracket when did the us have 90 % tax ? 
  why not ? 
  10k $ costume is nothing when you are billionaire . 
  of course he is going to be critized by the royalty . 
  anybody having more power than them would . 
  that 's not like it mattered . 
   other nations that in the end forced france to give back what was stolen you mean , italy pressured everyone to get back it 's stuff . 
  get real , nbody gave a fuck about it . 
  they would have get it themselves if they could . 
  i mean , in what world are you living in ? 
  my little pony dream garden land ? 
  it 's war time . 
  there is no `` law '' . 
  there are winner and loser . 
  that 's it . 
  people get their guts on the street , women get raped , kids get hanged . 
  you know , war . 
  and you are here , arguing about morality of stealing painting . 
  wtf . 
  and it 's exactly what is blame here . 
  you are more interested in being jealous about the costume he got from a friend , where nothing is illegal , rather than our territory being invaded . 
  how fucked up is that . 
  how is a dude receiving gift from a friend more important than our territory getting invaded by a neighbor ? 
  oh it 's because being rich/like luxury in this country is like having commited murderer . 
  that 's the type of shit that happens when you have a communist party that want to change the constitution . 
  im not goign to cry for you . 
  anybody mentioning fillon or le pen would be at minus 30 . 
  you are so wrong on this . 
  any entreprenour can . 
  look at the man who made minecraft, 
  he answered it . 
   what exactly are those [ ... ] really doing to deserve that money ? 
  answer : how is that your problem ? 
  mind your own fucking business and stop being jealous of other 's money . 
  are you planning to make us all poor ? 
  because that how you make us all poor . 
  you are not on r/france and people are n't pro m\u00e9lanchon here , so yeah , deal with it . 
  what 's going on loulan taking out the claw , wtf . 
  every single country he inspire himself from was either a dictator or one about to be . 
  i ca n't name a communist country that did n't fall into dictatorship . 
  are there others ? 
  edit : of course , forgot our universal kim the jung un . 
  because people are more interested in the price of the underpants of fillon , than real problem of france . 
  that 's how shitty our media is . 
  good shit that you remind us what 's going on on the other side of france . 
  we do n't have enough feedback of dom-tom and clearly are n't investing enough energy ( imo ), 
  that money is used to clean the leak , instead of fixing the pipe . 
  that 's the problem . 
  you are revisiting history to suit your narative . 
  no shit napol\u00e9on was critized by the italian for taking a spoil of war . 
  that does n't make it moraly wrong or right . 
   france was condemned no , they were not condemned . 
  there is no suchs things as country getting condemned because their is no higher authority . 
  france lost the war and had to give the painting back .

  donating blood has never been a fundamental human right , but merely a kind gesture that should only be done within the framework of reasonable sanitary guidelines . 
  as i said , i 'd rather avoid the word toxic in that context to begin with , but if we 're gon na do that for men then yeah definitely we should apply that to women too . 
  do n't ever trust someone who claims that there might be something wrong with half of mankind , but not with the other half . 
  it 's obviously absurd . 
  * toxic masculinity * supposedly refers to behaviors that ultimately end up being harmful to men themselves and to other people . 
  getting into a pointless bar brawl because some stranger said something about your girlfriend is the quintessential example of toxic masculinity - you 're just screwing yourself over for no reason and this is precisely why it 's a bad thing . 
  in practice however you 're right to remark that the very concept of toxic masculinity is very confusing . 
  it 's alienating because it kinda implies there 's something fundamentally wrong with an entire gender . 
  most people , starting with some feminists themselves , understand it exactly that way . 
  the basic idea behind toxic masculinity is valid in my opinion and describes a truth that men need to hear for their own good , but the expression itself is self defeating and counter-productive so it needs to go away . 
  what the hell are you even on about . 
  i do n't normally respond to troll accounts , but it 's important enough that people are aware [ they 're entitled by law anywhere in the eu to benefit from translators and interpreters when accused of a crime ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/justice/criminal/criminal-rights/right-translation/index_en.htm ) . 
  for fucking obvious reasons . 
  to be honest i 'm more surprised that people would apparently specifically ask for someone who speaks their language while ordering fast food . 
  i really do n't know much about germany , but this is surprisingly cheap . 
  chinese buffets and fast food menus would cost about twice as much if not more here . 
  i doubt it was that cheap , but in russia a lot of restaurants offer rather cheap 2 or 3-course `` business lunches '' with limited selection of food items . 
  first course is typically a soup too . 
  even in touristy places where they have a menu in english , unsurprisingly you 'll only find that on the russian language one . 
   too many rules , and more importantly people actually follow the rules , and you 'll be reprimanded by random citizens for breaking them . 
  interesting that you should say that , because for some reason i 've always assumed that the us was a place where you have to actually follow the ( many ) rules . 
  you might feel at home in france too . 
  people are generally standoffish enough not to inquire about your business , and there are a lot of laws/rules/codes that are on the books but neither socially-sanctioned nor even credibly enforced by the police or the government . 
  it 's just a matter of knowing what you can or ca n't get away with . 
   i think religion is a big factor in this too definitely , although the two issues are n't necessarily entirely disconnected from one another . 
  as i said in my initial comment and even though we westerners only hear of their beheadings , when it addresses young muslim men isis propaganda focuses a lot of on its '' * reclaim your manhood and be a real man * '' aspect which ca n't possibly be a coincidence . 
  they even make it a point to `` offer '' ( for lack of a better term ) a wife to all jihadis who have fought for them a certain time . 
   and for the arab spring there was also the issue of rising food prices interesting , i 've read the same thing about the french and russian revolutions . 
  it would make sense that people freak out as soon as they start fearing lacking the means to fulfill the most basic needs . 
   what i do n't get is why these traditional countries keep their traditional values when they obviously do n't work . 
  values are created subconsciously to fulfill practical , social or emotional needs . 
  the problem is that some people remain attached to values even when they 're way past their expiration date and stopped serving a practical need a long time ago . 
  it 's just inertia , and i 'm increasingly convinced that even liberals are n't immune to it . 
   how is the sexual/family thing different in the middle-east than in other parts of the world ? 
  before i reply , i 'd like to mention that i 'm actually a big proponent of the idea that the ability to find a spouse/partner/whatever and the ability to start a family in reasonably decent conditions all matter immensely . 
  even in rich western democracies . 
  that being said europe is n't in the same place as middle east countries . 
  social pressure and all sorts of social restrictions ( i tried dating a girl from a more traditional society once , the mere fact that i was n't a well-off established man from her hometown and sharing the same ethnicity as her were deal-breakers for her entire family ) are definitely a factor . 
  i 'm generalizing obviously , but in these societies a man needs some degree of success or socio-economic integration if he 's serious about dating the daughter or a traditional-minded father . 
  how can that happen when your society has like a 30 % joblessness rate and you 're one of the millions of young men , the demographic hardest hit by unemployment ? 
  to add insult to the injury , while you 're sitting on your ass with your friends , you witness so much corruption and nepotism going on . 
  soon enough you and your friends are going to lose all hope that one 's prospects in life can be improved through conventional means . 
  one day some minor event happens , but it 's the straw that breaks the camel 's back and all hell break loose . 
  i may be wrong and i 'm probably leaving out other important factors , but this pretty much sums up my understanding of the arab spring . 
  i 'm not entirely sure why you do n't see any of that in india and china , but those are strong states ( not so easy to stage a revolution in a country like china ) i suspect it has to do with the fact that there are more economic opportunities and other ways to improve one 's station in life . 
  i guess that in itself just lacking the ability to find a partner is n't enough to start revolutions . 
  well maybe you have your reasons to say that . 
  but in my experience most people who convey the same sentiment got irrationally angry hearing the expression `` end of history '' , left it at that and have never bothered read so much as one entire paragraph of his actual writings . 
  freudian psychoanalysts are gon na have a field day with that title ... ^ ^ and ^ ^ with ^ ^ your ^ ^ attempt ^ ^ at ^ ^ denial ^ ^ too . 
  since you 're sporting a turkey flair and most of us probably lack the context behind some weird-sounding statement like this : care to explain why would the pm say that ? 
  i think it may be an attempt to curb the appeal of extremism , but i 'm not sure though . 
  i read that isis propaganda focuses a lot on that aspect . 
  francis fukuyama once wrote that once ca n't understand much about current events in the middle east if you fail to take into account how young and how frustrated by a perceived lack of long term prospects ( socio-economic * and * sexual/family-wise ) so many men are in this part of the world . 
  most of it was copied and pasted from other sources anyway . 
  as a general rule ( which at least applies to american prisons ) , being imprisoned for racially-motivated crimes is a sure-fire way to get street cred and catapult oneself to the top of white prison gangs . 
  in the case of this guy who 's essentially a pointless teenager killer and seems like he 'd be a major pain in the ass to deal with though , i 'm pretty sure he would alienate himself even from likeminded racist inmates . 
  what struck me when i read a random excerpt from his `` manifesto '' is that he actually seems capable to challenge his own pre-conceived opinions when new information comes to light . 
  the man is a nutter , but probably not quite enough of a nutter to be genuinely unable to comprehend forever that at least he fucking killed innocent teenagers who had nothing whatsoever to do with his politics . 
  obviously he 's proven capable to cling to his bullshit rationalizations and may continue to do so for awhile , but i would n't be surprised if one day he woke up and realized the sheer horror of his actions , and how futile and destructive it all was . 
   we dont need the memoirs of brievik to be leaked out of jail or have him preach his hate . 
  pretty sure this is already happening . 
  sadly , he 's known to be a very prolific writer . 
  even from more serious sources though , the more i hear about this man the more i hate his guts . 
  he should consider himself lucky that it 's easier to deal with normal , peaceable `` je suis charlie '' middle-class folks than it is to deal with hateful ak47-toting islamists , as charlie hebdo had to . 
  he damn well knows it otherwise i doubt he would have the courage to take a stand . 
  decency alone should make any man think twice before causing controversy regarding a difficult topic for which people lost their lives , to make a profit selling books . 
  not sure , but it could be a case of mistranslation that stood the test of time and was already commonly used by the time somebody figured it out . 
  just like * la dr\u00f4le de guerre * ( `` funny war '' ) , mistranslated from its original * phoney war * but nonetheless remained in use because it makes sense too . 
  relatively positive . 
  there is n't really such a thing as moderate rebels , it 's about time somebody stops acting as if there were . 
  well maybe some here and there but they 're either infiltrated by salafists , militarily irrelevant or they 're territorial kurdish militias , which russia has n't attacked ( and likely wo n't , considering what putin said about them ) . 
  in any case , even if there were you could n't possibly trust them enough or assume they 're powerful enough to successfully assume control of a non-extremist government if assad were ousted . 
  i do n't * want to * support the syrian regime and ideally i would n't even want to support those who support the regime , but as far as both western and russian interests are concerned the syrian regime taking back control is the lesser evil in this scenario . 
  i want assad to eventually go because he 's the face of this and you wo n't have lasting peace otherwise , likewise it 'd be great if the sunni majority could gradually reach a substantially better representation in political power and the regime could reform itself . 
  but control of the entire country should never fall into the hands of any entity referred to as `` rebel '' by western media . 
  i do n't disagree with you , and i 'm sure there are many - otherwise decent - kids who find themselves alienated from society and wind up associating themselves with bad apples . 
  but it 's also worth mentioning that a lot of actual terrorists ( not every radical is a terrorist , but there 's obviously some overlap ) come from comparatively privileged backgrounds . 
  some are solid middle-class , others could n't pinpoint a specific instance of discrimination against themselves even if they wanted to . 
  society can spend billions trying to fix social issues all you want or constantly question its alleged racist biases - and those may be good things on their own right - but bear in mind there 's no fixing a small number of delusional individuals that are bent on mass murder . 
   well for starters there is lack of male role model for boys in school which should be considered alongside the fact that due to the massive proportion of divorced households and mothers typically receiving custody over their children , there 's a significant chance that those boys ( and those girls too ) will grow up without a lot of positive male role models . 
  the redditor you responded to is n't necessarily representative of what french people think . 
  i , for one , want to see each and everyone of these idiots prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law . 
  on top of being retarded , their violence is selfish because everybody else here loses from our country attracting fewer foreign investments . 
  and i 've been waiting for air france to go belly up for years . 
  same with every regional or global power , i guess . 
   least favourite neighbour : france ( though they are the only ones we respect ) we pretty much begrudgingly accept this as a given . 
  that 's more truth than i can bear in one sentence . 
  these students will eventually move on to live bourgeois middle-class lives and grow out of it , but the influence on society of like-minded people ( pretty much the ones that south park makes fun of these days ) remains . 
  changing society is like trying to steer a tanker , you may have left the ship but if you 've overshot it and set the ship to the wrong course it might not be easy to redress the whole thing in time . 
  iraq and isis-held territory are huge , but the heavily-contested parts of western syria just seem so small . 
  not taking sides here or anything , but how are you supposed to rest at night when you 're involved in what is pretty much an existential conflict , knowing that what separates you from your mortal enemies is no more than a 20-km wide friendly-held stretch of land ? 
  interesting . 
  i had no idea there was even a single country in europe easily allowing concealed carry . 
   terrorism , france is n't same france 2 years ago or 3 and , god forbid , going by the current rate of terrorist attacks france could be an even different place by election time . 
  how much is a 1 bedroom apartment not too far from city centre ? 
  this one : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9cv-aq45ve , which is topical i guess !, 
  yeah i 'd say that in my experience most irish people do adjust , no complaints there . 
  what i meant was more that language is a continuum with so many variations that past a certain point it 's not really a matter of speaking it vs not speaking it anymore . 
  i 'll admit i did have hiberno english in mind writing this . 
  nah not necessarily .

  i mean geographically speaking , eastern europe starts in ukraine . 
  have n't they got extinct a few years back ? 
  a true english story !, 
  it 's pretty accurate . 
  yeah i know , it was more ironical than anything, 
  is it really europe ? 
  they do n't really belong to anyone so far from civilization on their tiny island !, 
  thank us boys , if we did not clear the mess in 1066 , it would be way harder to learn english today, 
  anyway we are still somehow linked to them . 
  okay it 's not an `` union '' but we have tons of trade agreement with them . 
  there is a real collaboration today with most of our colonies . 
  i wonder what would happen if we offered them the choice to join us again now . 
  tbh it would be great to still have north africa and the haute-volta . 
  those are not `` shitty countries '' . 
  most of them are rich in ressources and they became shitty after we left them . 
  i support extended france , like belgium , switzerland , ivory coast , burkina faso , s\u00e9n\u00e9gal , ... 
  i do n't care about stereotypes , there is tons about france , but that does not refrain us to be the most touristy country in the world anyway . 
  so whatever they say about us , they still seems to quite like the country . 
  like if belgium was not defeated too , as most of europe, 
  fantastic seems a bit too audacious . 
  at least from france !, 
  nah i think it 's a thing that often come when you talk about germany . 
  at least in france . 
  how is fighting in syria a bad thing ? 
  would you prefer isis to expand maybe ? 
  your arguments are plain stupid, 
  what is this sport ? 
  the vironia one is nice, 
  city24.ee for estonia, 
  seems good enough . 
  you can take them now, 
  no it 's not, 
  at least here you will not get gang raped by pajeet and the gang, 
  not really . 
  putin is written as poutine because - ou is the correct way to phonetically translate the - \u0443 sound from russian . 
  our transcript of his name is just the only one possible in french to reproduce his name correctly . 
  the champions !, 
  oh okay , thanks for your very comprehensive answer , i learned a lot !, 
  is danish very different from swedish and norwegian ? 
  i think by country op meant `` real country '', 
  does it works on the other sense ? 
  because if yes , african americans should stop building concrete house and should go back to live in shitty soil houses, 
  all hail the fourth reich !, 
  grenoble, 
  not france, 
  wtf, 
  both languages are not spoken in all switzerland . 
  if he goes to geneva , where they speak french , she will have a hard time speaking german there . 
  what a shitty title . 
  if only we had succeed ... 
  lol it 's pretty casual for a greeting . 
  maybe not if you were young though, 
  very very common in france, 
  because here in france we stand up when the teacher enter the classroom . 
  it 's only done up to high school, 
  now , we continue to bitch and moan avout everything . 
  and to speak french too lol . 
  seems to be nice people there, 
  wearing jeans is very common in france too . 
  being dressed correctly is quite important though , and it 's pretty uncommon to see people dressed like shit at the supermarket . 
  but i do n't think if it is as important as you american seem to think it is for us . 
  you can still go to euro 2020 , there 's games everywhere in europe , witg semi and final in england, 
  fascist group, 
  i do n't know if it would make more of us pro-nato , but the fact is that with the loss of us we would loose too much . 
  we are one of the few country to have a decent army in europe , and i do n't see how eu could compensate the loss of us . 
  us quitting nato is the worst thing i can see happen for eastern europe . 
  i think it 's mostly cultural ( at least in the west ) and maybe ethnic ( mostly in the east ), 
  * libert\u00e9 , egalit\u00e9 , fraternit\u00e9 * in our country , everyone should be able to do what he wants , and respect the others . 
  do n't be edgy, 
  do n't be a jerk, 
  plus , does n't it took only 3 yeats to gain citizenship there ? 
  only downside is that it 's not eu though, 
  french . 
  ... why should you speak another one ? 
  are danish , swedish and norwegian very similar ? 
  i ask because i always found it weird that regens from nordic countries in football manager usually spawn speaking the 3 . 
  i crossed the border from estonia to russia by bus and there was not any trouble . 
  i had the correct visa though, 
  belgium , thanks to being such a good neighbor, 
  i do n't know , he is becoming more and more a whore for fn voters . 
  well , see what happens in the 30s , and there was no internet, 
  maybe because they are anti democratic, 
  both are very unpopular in france . 
  that 's why juppe is popular , and we will probably juppe vs le pen with juppe winning by a good margin . 
  impressive skill knowing how few of them remain in poland nowaday, 
  i do n't think that 's right for mainland french . 
  we always use it in french like in english . 
  d\u00e9sol\u00e9 , bonjour , pardon , comment allez-vous ? , merci are used a lot during the day . 
  not using them is very shocking for a french and would be seen as very impolite . 
  something very racist about black people / immigrants . 
  wtf, 
  `` the only thing we learn from history is that we learn nothing from history . '', 
  apparently , if you say  [ ` please ' , ` thank you ' , ` you are welcome ' , ` may i ' , ` excuse me ' , ` pardon me ' , ` sorry ' , ` thanks ' ] so according to the bot , you can say  please , can you go fuck youself ? 
  thank you and be considered polite . 
   i think it would be a good thing if you broadcast everything in english instead . 
  :p well , it 's called france 24 for a reason , not perfide albion 24 . 
   it 's not healthy is it ? 
  not it 's clearly not . 
  on another point , the scotland situations seems a bit too much . 
  i think it 's clearly in conflict with the principle of laicity , at least how we see it in france .

yeah there is , i just ca n't seem to find it other than with the search function . 
  something 's wrong . 
  speaking of that thread , where has it gone ? 
  i ca n't seem to find it through the `` hot '' page , only by searching ... ? 
   my nickname since youth has been oreo that 's referring to you `` acting white '' i suppose ? 
  disgusting , the people calling you that must barely qualify for human being status . 
   i did n't realize french society was this rotten . 
  [ well ] ( http://www.lefigaro.fr/actualite-france/2012/11/28/01016-20121128artfig00494-sans-papiers-les-nouveaux-criteres-de-regularisation.php ) , [ now ] ( http://bochnakian-bruno-avocat.fr/les-droits-des-etrangers-sans-papiers-en-france/ ) [ you ] ( http://avocat-cujas.fr/etrangers-sans-papiers-regularisation-par-le-travail-circulaire-valls.html ) [ know ] ( http://www.lemonde.fr/immigration-et-diversite/article/2016/08/22/en-2016-le-combat-pour-la-regularisation-se-joue-sur-les-lieux-de-travail_4986032_1654200.html ) ( comments are absolutely hilarious and sad at the same time ) the amnesties of illegals are our fault but the rest is n't * french * society 's fault . 
   visited lenin 's tomb for his honeymoon kek . 
  that must 've been one hell of a honeymoon . 
  i 'm just hoping they did n't forget to visit mao too . 
  you ca n't seriously believe that . 
  most of these people `` fled '' from assad , and as a result they can argue that his secret police would imprison and torture them . 
  most of them probably have one or multiple relatives fighting in one of the factions , which would qualify them for collective punishment , one more argument they 'll whip out to stay here . 
  lastly , even those that ca n't cite any reason at all why they 're refugees , or should i say ** especially ** those people will quickly go underground , evading deportation and simply living here illegally , employed ( maybe ) and shielded by their community until the next amnesty of illegals . 
  just because europe has many cultures certainly does n't mean it was a melting pot . 
  to me it 's your punishments that sound too soft :p, 
  no one expected or should have expected any presidential candidate to follow up on all his promises . 
  u-turns are completely usual and have always been ( sadly ) . 
  it 's not something specific to one candidate or one party . 
  cheating in a debate by knowing questions in advance is something completely different , because while both candidates can make u-turns , cheating gives you an unfair and undeserved advantage over the other . 
  edit : you keep editing your posts to add more talking points after the fact . 
  lol . 
  your definition of biased is that it does n't relay russian propaganda talking points , hilarious . 
  there 's enough to blame those channels for , but you decided to do it for not making a logical link between signing an eu association agreement and invasion by russia . 
  your article also calls them biased for not underlining the role of `` national-socialist forces '' ( lol they knew this one was gon na work in germany ) and for not `` including the territorial and political intentions of nato in its eastern expansion '' . 
  i knew you were going to argue like that . 
  do you really think it matters if it 's technically legal or not ? 
  it 's subvertion of the democratic process through cheating in the presidential debate . 
  few things are more relevant than that in a fair election . 
  it also depends on what you mean by `` attention '' . 
  the `` disregard , we 're under attack by russia '' talking point was followed diligently by every major news network and the vast majority of online news ( and `` news '' ) outlets in the u.s. and even in the world . 
  it has n't stuck because it was unconvincing to begin with . 
  true , but since we 're reacting to this specific piece of news , i think even the more level headed will condemn these statements as a bad start to a trump-eu relationship . 
  [ donna brazile obtaining presidential debate questions and forwarding them to hillary ? ] ( https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/38478 ) . 
  [ earlier email ] ( https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/5205 ) oh and naturally you 're ignoring the part where i called out your faulty logic . 
  edit : also nice of you to edit your post to add more talking points , making it seem as if i had n't adressed them . 
   i 've been screaming yes we know , that 's why you 're not being taken seriously . 
   people are more outraged about relatively innocuous contents of dnc emails rather than the fact that geopolitical adversary hacked those emails * the contents were not innocuous and contributed markedly to trump 's win . 
  the idea they 're innocuous is a media/spin talking point that has proven very disconnected from reality , if only because people have been fired over it . 
  * on the contrary , it 's pathetic to scream `` russia russia pants on fayah '' in response to shady dealings or outright illegal activites being unconvered . 
  the source matters less than the content . 
  `` disregard the illegally obtained proof of my illegal/shady activity '' is not a good argument . 
  what , would you prefer every thread to be like the first on trump being elected was ? 
  it was a massive circlejerk mixed with hysteria and bombastic statements . 
  i 'm happy there 's people here that can keep a cool head and see juncker 's gauche comments for what they are : a bad start to our relationship with the trump administration . 
  i disagree entirely . 
  what experience have you had that we 'd come to such different conclusions ? 
  this . 
  labelling opposition as russian agents is nothing but a way to attack them without solving any of the issues they ride on . 
  that 's very intolerant of you . 
  instead of turning to reactionary capitalism ( and flag-waving , gasp ! ), 
  you should 've stayed a puppet of the glorious , egalitarian , progressive ussr . 
  funny , last time i was in the hague i saw that exact sign on the lithuanian embassy 's window . 
  wow no !, 
  never again !, 
  that 's why we need high immigration , first because hitler would n't like it and second because replacing our population ensures it 'll never happen again !, 
  i agree , i 'm just saying that canada is essentially doing it for pr and nothing more . 
  i 'm not surprised , considering their prime minister . 
  only as long as france has a very very important role in it , first because france has got the most credible armed forces in europe atm , and second because france needs a guarantee that it wo n't be hampered/limited ( instead of empowered ) by closer eu military cooperation . 
  i 'm referring to interventions in africa , for example . 
  it has to be full , honest cooperation , not the cherrypicked kind . 
  that 's the only way you 'll have a chance of selling something as important as that to france and its electorate . 
  i think serious advances would also require either more consciousness about that issue in french internal politics as well as an exogenous push , e.g. 
  something about terrorism or russia doing something important to displease france ( once more ) . 
   they have refugees which they handpicked amongst families , women and children ( yes , they must 've found some ) and took only in small numbers . 
  thanks , canada . 
  well , first of all , it 's highly likely we 'll have a r\u00e9publicains vs fn second round . 
  second , in that case it 's very very likely that ps voters will , as is done in france , vote for the right to avoid a fn victory . 
  and recognising that is what leads them to wish very hard for jupp\u00e9 , who 's not that right-wing , to be the r\u00e9publicains candidate . 
  if he 's named candidate , he would most likely win handily , but i think it 'll come at the cost of him not enacting actual right-wing policies , or enacting any important policies at all for that matter . 
  i personally would prefer fillon , he convinced me more than the other candidates in the debates they had . 
  i think that even if sarkozy were to be the candidate , you 'd still probably have a right-wing victory against fn , though there 'd be less left support ( and thus it 'd be closer ) than with someone like fillon because sarkozy is kind of polarizing . 
  i think jupp\u00e9 is exactly the kind of politician who ends up strengthening the general disillusionment with mainstream politics . 
  he 's not really right-wing , more like a centrist trying to take a `` unifying '' stance , but the constant quest for compromise this implies will do nothing but prove `` umps '' right . 
  no need to stock up on salt , you produce enough of it already . 
  you 're right that there were large resettlement campaigns to provide a minimum of loyal population in a newly conquered place . 
  they also resettled muslim albanians and their lords on many occasions ( though i do n't know in what kind of numbers ) . 
  but the presence of pomaks in bulgaria , who are converted slavs but not turks ( probably recent converts who had n't assimilated into turkishness yet ) as well as the cases of bosnia and albania show there must 've been some large conversions going on too . 
  generally those are ( only ) tacitly encouraged . 
  i mean , i do n't think pomaks and bosniaks could all be descendents of resettled turks , there 's way too many for that , and in the case of pomaks , iirc a portion of their villages became muslim through force or intimidation . 
  in bosnia it was probably a process of gradual assimilation . 
  there 's large muslim communities in bosnia and bulgaria . 
  there were a lot in greece and on the greek islands but the last of them were forced out in the postwar population exchange . 
  i think they definitely converted large communities in strategic regions , sometimes by force . 
  for example , bosnia was useful to them as a strong , militarised border district . 
  since the core soldiers were generally muslim , they had great interest in converting it . 
  also , did n't they settle muslim albanian lords and their followers in a lot of balkan places ? 
  the ottoman empire had a pretty colonialist ( not exactly in the european sense ) policy in the territories it conquered , and they were using local ( implanted or converted ) muslim populations as bloody , lawless militia ( bachi-bouzouk ) . 
  also , since conversion meant becoming a turk , it also meant becoming an agent of the oppressor . 
  that 's why in those kinds of cases less difference is made between civilians and soldiers than in others . 
  no , belgium is too dysfunctional and i see a lot of dutch people here being quick to point it out . 
  i 'm sure they 'd be happy to teach us a lesson in tolerance and diversity !, 
  edit : i thought people would n't need an / s to realise i was joking . 
  idiotic new worlders ' law . 
  the armenian genocide happened during and after ww1 . 
  but let 's not deviate from the main point : you 're justifying genocide , and i just showed that the oppression and massacres did n't simply happen as a reaction to their alliance with russia . 
  rather , that alliance happened because they saw it as their salvation from oppression . 
   the origins of the hostility toward armenians lay in the increasingly precarious position in which the ottoman empire found itself in the last quarter of the 19th century . 
  the loss of ottoman dominion over the balkans was ushered in by an era of european nationalism and an insistence on self-determination by many territories long held under ottoman rule .

  i always respected and admire that in russia geography does n't get in the way of who the civilians identifies as . 
  what i know about russia is . 
  - there women are incredibly beautiful . 
  - they have a strong sense of loyalty to one another and country . 
  - there women are very loyal and traditional which is cool . 
  - they have a beautiful language - they famously defeated us and took away our pride . 
  i think thats all i can remember lol . 
  he 's not wrong at all tbh !, 
  well , the french have always lived in the land it currently does ( franks - gauls ) . 
  the germans under a different name have also never migrated anywhere and remained in the land they currently inhabit . 
  though you make a point in regards to africa since , all of civilisation started and migrated out of africa . 
  im late here but thanks for sharing . 
  its often when we really experience the situation for ourselves do we really understand in an educational way . 
  thanks for your service . 
  i was surprised , thought it was real . 
  thanks for clarifying  . 
  edit : hopefully someone can better translate . 
  oh my goodness , can you read what they were saying in the beginning ? 
  `` shut him up '' - `` take that terrorist and shoot him '' - `` a bullet , get him a bullet . '', 
  damn , they really do n't like him lol . 
  this is the first time , i 'm seeing someone being thrown words like this . 
  is this common ? 
  its so crazy how this civil war would have global ramifications . 
  and in a way , i 'm kinda happy it did , only because the soviet union contributed so much in helping the allies win ww2 . 
  its cool you picked that up. , took a while for me to realize this a little . 
  from what i 've seen , sometimes the feelings here shifts . 
  like , in some days ( or week ) you 're gon na have left wing ideologies , then , after a couple of days , it changes . 
  its weird but not in a bad way . 
  nice !, 
  i never even new this . 
  thanks for sharing ,, 
  very good point . 
  i do n't have money for gold though unfortunately . 
  while i will agree that some people should not be leaders . 
  democracy , regardless of the man or women that was elected democratically , should be respected due to the office he/she holds . 
  to advocate for an assassination of a leader who was in all grounds , elected democratically and legally , would be spitting on the very values of democracy and lets others aware that you do not actually respect it . 
  i apologize if im coming towards you as rude btw , not my intention . 
  lmao, 
  whats the point of admitting something when everyone already knew ? . 
  lmaooo , you 're funny . 
  i 've always had that pov as well . 
  hopefully its not a bad thing lol . 
  what are you talking about , she 's from france . 
  yep, 
  she 's beautiful , but then again , french women are naturally beautiful , so its no surprise , 
  i wish people knew this . 
  i 've came across many people who confused the two accidentally . 
  not there fault i guess . 
  id love to walk through there . 
  it looks so very peaceful to me . 
  i dont think you deserved that downvote since what you said is the truth . 
  so the devil boruta is like the person trying to keep the order ? 
  the cell . 
  is it a prison ? 
  i do enjoy seeing france & germany doing things together . 
  this is amazing !, 
  i really got into this video and i never even heard of it . 
  first time seeing this . 
  just one question , the women , is she a witch ? 
  since the guy gave her a broom . 
  what is she ? 
  is she someone who can heal but also destroy ? 
  since when she was planting a grass , there was fire behind her . 
  idk , she reminds me of the greek god , apollo , meant to be very beautiful , can heal but can also be destructive . 
  but this was a really awesome video !, 
  i 'd love t see more, 
  really ? 
  did n't know that . 
  they are disliked because they disregard the host of the countries laws . 
  in any community , for people to get along requires more than just obeying the law . 
  people follow social norms and implicit social rules so that everyone is better off . 
  those who transgress this face isolation . 
  this also gets people from romania angry because lots of people confuses them with the roma people . 
  i 'm like you , i never meet them , despite my occasional visits to france to stay with family during school holidays . 
  so i only go by what my friends living there experience with them . 
  lol , you can say that again . 
  dammit , how many times will i fall victim to it, 
  i never liked him , im pretty happy he 's no longer going to lead my country . 
  i simply saw no hope for my country with him leading it . 
  thanks so much !, 
  you arent being downvoted sir . 
  i saw 4 upvotes , 5 upvotes now . 
  i think i 'm part of that 22 % . 
  so far i can only say simple things . 
  i only did this cause my gf was a german and wanted to learn her language to get to know her more if that 's the right way of saying it . 
  i just wish he thought more about what he was doing . 
   travelled to syria hoping that life in islamic state 's ` caliphate would be an ideal religious environment . 
  i can not accept this reason because , in bosnia , more then [ 50 % ] ( http://www.worldatlas.com/articles/religious-demographics-of-bosnia-and-herzegovina.html ) of civilisans follow the islamic faith . 
  just a few miles south , is another country with a much larger percentage of those who follows the islamic faith . 
  it 's an unacceptable reason . 
   some have joined counter-messaging campaigns in attempts to convince other muslims not to make the same mistakes that took them to the battlefields of the middle east . 
  at least he can be useful . 
  i hope the eu has a much more aggressive stance in dealing with stuff like this . 
  because this is among the many other cases where people from europe would go to middle east , expecting some paradise to be waiting for them . 
  whether to fight under the banner of jihad or marry , excuse my language , an asshole who follows the wahhabist ideology . 
  you 're right !, 
  haha , i feel blind wow . 
  come on guys , there 's so much more to france then just the eiffel tower lol . 
  and interesting choice of words . 
  `` sick man of europe '' makes me assume that the ottomans economic decline is similar to italy 's .

   if the individual does n't get enough tips to meet min wage , the employer has to cover that gap for all individuals . 
  and greeks businesses are supposed to pay their taxes honestly . 
  that never happen either . 
   waiters and bartenders make on average well above the min wage . 
  this map suggest it 's flatly false in states where there is a `` tipped minimal wage '' : https://www.bls.gov/oes/current/sw353031.png  they like the current system for that reason and because many of them report their full tips ( irs estimates 40 % of tips are unreported ) . 
  no they do n't , but i know i can count on the average republican supporter like you to pretend that being paid less is being paid more . 
   they file a bls greivance , which costs nothing . 
  and lead nowhere lol ; which is why there are now class action lawsuits on most chains . 
   do n't know about paranoia , but certianly ignorance of the issue . 
  or you are naive . 
  if employers can not pay you , they wo n't . 
   ask anyone in the us who works for tips if they wish to change the system . 
  well most i met wanted their paycheck not to be docked just as much as i did unsurprizingly ... 
  receiving 100 $ paychecks `` because you have tips anyway '' with $ 1000 of basic living expanses ( rent , food , utilities , insurances , ... ) is only fun for a month or two then get quickly old . 
   again , i find it amusing that every american here is telling you one thing , yet all the europeans are telling us why we are wrong . 
  if you do n't like tipping , do n't go out to eat in the us , canada , or mexico . 
  no one is forcing you . 
  that is dishonest ; you can tip all you want ; i 'm only attacking the fact that the tip being paid is used by many restaurant owners not to pay the federal minimal wage ( they dock the tip and more against your wage ) . 
   no , that is inaccurate . 
  they can offset the $ 2.13 per hour in some places , but only if you are making so much that it is irrelevant that is not true . 
  from personal experience , if the `` tipped minimal wage '' is 2 $ , you can only expect 2 $ / hour plus the occasional 10 $ / 20 $ a day or two per month . 
  you 're not going to make a living from that ; and this is exactly what i 'm attacking : the system is turning on it 's population and the current generation is forced into burger flipping mcjobs because there is nothing else and you think it 's normal not to pay them a living . 
  worse ; you 're pretending they 're `` well paid '' on top of it and invent creative excuses to `` back '' it up . 
   when i started working as a waiter , the minimum wage for tipped employees was $ 2.02 per hour 30 years ago ? 
  you know that with inflation that would be like 25-30 $ / hour now ? 
  i 'm not arguing in favor of banning tips , i 'm saying the employers should have to pay minimal wage anyway despite you being tipped . 
   no , there is no `` blue '' or `` red '' in this matter . 
  tipping is the standard practice in the whole country . 
  you 're misleading and dishonestly playing on words : https://consumermediallc.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/wagemap.png in the state in red on that map , the employer can dock most of your pay if you `` make enough '' tips ; they do n't have to pay a full minimal wage, 
   no , owners do not keep tips . 
  if they tried , the waistaff would file a lawsuit . 
  and how do they even pay the lawyers or prove they did n't received the tips the restaurant declared they got lol ? 
  but yes lawsuits are happening to some degree anyway , as is pointing out the link i added to my last post : http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/restaurant-chains-hit-with-wage-theft-lawsuits_us_59136869e4b0d928baa249b7 http://www.phillyemploymentlawyer.com/wage-theft-epidemic-restaurant-industry/ http://www.salon.com/2017/01/27/wage-and-labor-violations-flourished-at-restaurants-linked-to-trumps-labor-pick/  it is hard to get firm data on how much waters and waitresses make , becuase so much of the income is unreported funny yeah ? 
  i 'd bet the republicans encouraged to destroy that data to argue in favor of lowering the minimal wage ; but that 's probably just my paranoia talking . 
  oh wait , they 're actually lowering it already in several states : http://www.salon.com/2017/07/09/republicans-in-several-states-are-lowering-the-minimum-wage-yes-you-read-that-right/  this bbc article says the median income for a waiter in france is $ 2,000 per month . 
  the us equivalent is about $ 2,128 . 
  and on 2k $ / month in france ( not in paris ok but in a big city ) i could live like with 6/8k $ in california ( not bay area ) lol, 
   no , employers can not keep tips you keep ignoring willfully the elephant in the room , that the restaurant generally said you got tipped enough & in cash that they do n't have to pay you a month of income . 
  then pocket them anyway . 
  it 's pretty hard to prove it 's not true . 
  wage theft with tipping loopholes are widespread in restaurant businesses . 
  it 's like expecting a greek business to pay his taxes honestly . 
   as it is a national practice . 
  but most blue states enforce minimal wage nontheless . 
  people can tip you on top of your wage , but the restaurant owner in those is n't entitled to withold your pay `` because you got paid enough by tips already '' . 
  edit http://www.phillyemploymentlawyer.com/wage-theft-epidemic-restaurant-industry/ edit : http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/restaurant-chains-hit-with-wage-theft-lawsuits_us_59136869e4b0d928baa249b7, 
  your post history suggest you lived in florida , which enforce a minimal wage ( 5 $ ) even on `` tipped wages '' . 
  if you add tips on top of the minimal wage then yeah you can make extra cash . 
  but did you worked in a state where they did n't had to pay you beyond the tips ? 
   so you do n't know what at will employment means , huh ? 
  it is illegal to withhold tips from an employee , dumbass . 
  yet they do it because it 's so easy to do it . 
   yes , they do . 
  they literally make twice as much as french waiters . 
  you 're smoking lol . 
  whatever , you 're in your fantasy picture and it 's a waste of time . 
  i 'll just put you in ignore list  if france was a state it would be poorer than mississippi or louisiana , dumbass . 
   how is it hard to imagine in a restaurant with a decent amount of guests ? 
  i can assure you that the waiter probably earn loads more than the person actually making the food . 
  the only tip you 're going to get you is the one paid in cash . 
  the ones paid in cb ? 
  you 're never going to get them lol ; the owner pocket them from exp, 
  that 's quite rare because most pizza boys i knew of generally end up with more like 7 $ / hour tips included . 
   what the fuck are you talking about ? 
  are you trolling here ? 
  have you worked in the united states as a waiter ? 
  so now you know more about an american waiters economic situation than an american waiter ? 
  what the fuck ? 
  live halfway between france & california . 
  the state decided to enforce the minimal wage even on `` tipped jobs '' for a reason : because they were n't actually paid . 
   so now you know more about an american waiters economic situation than an american waiter ? 
  you 're not one lol  american waiters make twice as much as french waiters . 
  no they absolutely do n't in tipped states lol  american waiters on average make $ 20 + / hr that just does n't happen in red states lol ; it 's touching you remind me of the people that came from africa expecting a 100 ' 000 $ landfall just for entering italy . 
  you surely have heard tall tales but no tipped minimal wage only mean you earn less . 
   they are n't exempt from paying you , what the fuck . 
  actually they can pay you a `` tipped minimal wage '' which is like 2 $ / h and knowing that the average restaurant do n't declare additional hours and make you sign a like 18h/w contract you will have like 150 $ / month in reality . 
  and considering you need like 500 $ / month to live in the us in a red state you 're not going to get by on that lol . 
  it 's basically unpaid . 
  you 're better off leaving the state ( which people do ) . 
   if you do n't make minimum wage through tips then your employer has to make up the difference . 
  that 's cute ; most of the time they declare you have been tipped in cash and do n't pay it because it 's impossible to prove the restaurant is fucking you over . 
  inb4 `` it 's illegal '' ; obviously no you have never been there , never worked in a restaurant , let alone in a red state . 
  and no i came back to france initially because i could n't pay my bills and ended up priced out of the country due to at the time too many jobs with bullshit loopholes like that . 
  at the time i litterally could not pay the rent anymore . 
   that 's illegal no it 's not , you never have seen the `` at will employment '' states right ? 
   no , it 's because american waiters make significantly more through tips than french no they do n't , and if you ever visited the states where it 's a practice ( think arkansas , alabama or mississipi ) they invariably are thirdworld poor towns that are actually having worse infra than romania itself . 
  there might be a reason . 
  like the fact that having an entire economy built on not paying people a living tend to destroy the economy and cause massive depressions there . 
   once again it 's confirmed that you 've never been the us you 're hallucinating or you are a trump true-believer morron  which makes you an idiot . 
  repeating that i 'm an idiot will not turn `` trickle down '' lies into reality . 
   that 's illegal  they do n't have a two month turnover , you 're naive are you ? 
  maybe you should visit those states yourself one day . 
  the reason they always hire waiters is because people flee those jobs there after quickly realising they wo n't be paid so there is no point in doing them . 
  that only exist in the dreams of the `` trickle down '' `` supply side '' voters . 
  you ca n't make a living on a `` tipped job '' , period . 
  the excuse for their creation was `` oh well it 's for students and they live at their parents anyway so they only need pocket money '' . 
  same shit you hear for `` unpaid internships '' . 
  edit : to which i have to add that if people want to tip you they can anyway , but exempting the employer from having to pay you is just a bad joke . 
  only in red states you can convince people that by not paying them `` you will earn more '' / s, 
  lol @usual lie .

  face it . 
  the european project was always about a political union , with free trade as the main tool to foster unity between the european people . 
  there was no sudden addition of new things that were n't part of the plan . 
  it was the plan all along . 
  oh sure , i was just pointing out that posting eu sources is n't going to convince anti-ceta people . 
  that 's obviously if you believe that source . 
  well that 's a bit sad . 
  ceta really looked like a good deal , and had reformed a lot of issues people had with isds . 
  the truth of the matter is , no amount of negotiation could 've saved it , the wallons were against free trade with canada on principle . 
  maybe the only positive is that we can stop trying to pretend ttip is going to happen . 
  french politicians always blame the eu for every single thing . 
  and then there 's the usual anti-eu arguments . 
  though i do n't think a frexit is possible yet . 
  we 're not that retarded . 
  i hope . 
  nah mate italy is france 's twin brother , germany is france 's ex-rapist-turned-loving-boyfriend and they 've been engaged for ages but marriage is still a long ways off . 
  every now and again people say germany is being too demanding as a partner or france is being too bitchy . 
  right , right , we got that french is useless and we should all speak english because linguistical diversity is evil in your eyes . 
  the real question is , why do you still hold to your idiotic belief that `` le french politishuns want us to speak only french in teh eu !!!, 
  '' , when 1 ) no evidence for this anywhere 2 ) barnier denied that he wanted brexit negotiations to be done in french only ? 
  everybody , call the newspapers : `` french language is dead because apparently they do n't speak it in denmark !, 
  ceta 's dead , baby , ceta 's dead . 
   it is only growing in africa because of population increases . 
  yeah , having a language increasing in speakers because the population is increasing is just cheating . 
   most of those learns english as well . 
  why not skip the middle man and simply ignore the french . 
  why do n't we all just drop all our languages and speak only english ? 
  what 's the point of languages at all , then ? 
   i use a word like archaic because dumb french eu politicians thinks the rest of europe should speak french because their massive ego thinks that is best for all . 
  nobody in france seriously wants french to be the single eu language . 
  this is just a dumb clich\u00e9 , on par with saying that english people still want their empire back . 
  also : https://twitter.com/michelbarnier/status/789459759615410180 now do n't you look so smart . 
  on the same day talks collapse between the wallonians and canada . 
  nice effort guys , but it seems like it was for nothing . 
  it 's not declining , and how the hell is it * archaic * ? 
  well yes , of course you would think that . 
  it 's been a general complaint by gamers that a lot of dlc are just cash grabs and not real expansions on the game . 
  to take an example about civ 5 , quite a few civilisations were already done and ready but were n't included in the vanilla game but as separate dlc . 
  brave new world and gods and kings were more like `` real '' expansions pack . 
  when i said `` dlc is content that should have been in the vanilla game '' i 'm talking about stuff like that . 
  obviously you 'd change the lyrics a bit . 
  the civ 4 expansions had great title themes as well : [ warlords ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9poubewoag ) and [ beyond the sword ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yriv8iwu6my ), 
  meh , they really should just take the anthem of the [ champion 's league . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qqd6t_a9ly ), 
  civilization games have always had a slight euro-centric slant , but honestly they 've also done a stellar job with non-european civilisations . 
  i mean in civ 4 , the khmer , mali and the maya rank among the best civs in the game . 
  in civ 5 you also have pretty awesome non-european civs . 
  i do n't even remember what civ 5 's theme really was ... 
  there 's a real difference between expansion packs and most dlc though . 
  expansion packs were , well , extensions to a finished product . 
  dlc is content that honestly should have been in the vanilla game , but sold separately . 
  it 's not just the cut content , there were design decisions i did n't like at all , even with dlc . 
  gah , i thought i was done with civilization after the disappointment that civ 5 , but civ 6 hype is getting to me . 
  ceta is public , and by all accounts canada accepted a lot of stuff . 
  well , they are english . 
  they have waaaaaay more animosity for us than we have for them . 
  it 's clearly not a serious proposal - just a way for her to deflect accusations of racism by saying `` look !, 
  i do n't specifically hate muslims !, 
  see , i want to ban * all * religious symbols in public ! '' . 
  which is the textbook definition of an unenforceable policy . 
  if i wear a small necklace with a star of david , a hand of fatimah , a cross , a hindu aum , whatever , who the fuck can stop me from wearing it when i 'm in the street ? 
  we should commit to full and uncompromised secularism in schools and public administrations , ban stuff like the niqab , and then just let people be people . 
  there is no constitutional right to be a backwards religious zealot . 
  the good old days !, 
  that 's lgbtqia + to you , shitlord, 
  the fact that seeing well-dressed people smoke in public was a culture shock to you is a culture shock to me !, 
  errrr , who said anything about wars now ? 
  isds wo n't be removed , but they did refine it in something looking pretty much like an international court , with possibility to appeal the decisions , i believe , as well as defining more rigidly the cases that can be brought up to the court . 
  so if a country gets money it should shut up just out of gratitude ? 
  thank goodness people who think like you are n't in charge or the eu would have been dead for a long time . 
  the eu did n't steal any rights . 
  states wilfully gave them , democratically at that , to eu institutions . 
  well , we ca n't say because ttip negotiations are n't done yet . 
  but from what we know , the usa looks like its not budging on the `` buy american '' rules for public procurement and contracts , or on precautionary principle , or on geographical certification ... 
  most people have a view that canadian companies are n't as vicious as us multinational corporations . 
  which is kinda bullshit . 
  thank you . 
  people say the eu `` should reform '' , but it does that very regularly and step by step - you ca n't reform an organisation like that by snapping your fingers . 
  the eu can only be reformed by little steps at a time because of its very nature . 
  maastricht was really an outlier in terms of boldness and scope , and i do n't think we 'll see a treaty like maastricht anytime soon . 
  but the walloon opposition is n't about clauses put that go against their will . 
  they reject the very basis of ceta , e.g. 
  free trade and larger market share for canadian agricultural exports , because of fears for walloon farmers . 
  and romania is barely about trade at all , it 's political leverage for another issue ( visas ) . 
  sure , which is also why ttip will never happen - it 's political poison . 
  but that 's from member states and public opinion , not eu negotiators . 
  wow , that 's even more plastic than manchester united fans . 
  been seeing this a lot . 
  how is the ** eu ** , as in , the commission , the parliament , other eu institutions , etc. 
  responsible ? 
  they successfully negotiated a treaty . 
  it 's the member states that do n't want it . 
  also this is just * one * treaty . 
  it 's not the first one signed and it 's not the last . 
  there are fears about the agricultural sector though , not on health/safety but that canadian competition would hurt farmers and the like . 
  eeeh . 
  i oppose ttip but am in support of ceta . 
  it 's a good deal for us and we 'll benefit , i think . 
  also , canada is n't the usa . 
  i understand the `` trojan horse '' argument , but are n't there specific rules of origin that prevent this ?

  thus , he does n't care about the position of countries like romania that are merely pawns between the us and russia . 
  if you read the very recent opinion piece which was published in * the guardian * and quoted above , it 's obvious that chomsky does n't find what georgians , ukrainians , eastern germans and others want relevant . 
  only nato , which means the us , and russia , are relevant here , despite the fact that both protagonists are n't suffering the consequences of their game themselves . 
  chomsky is great at debunking us propaganda and hypocrisy . 
  on the other hand , he leaves much to be desired when it comes to us opponents . 
  the same reasoning blinded him at the time of the cambodian atrocities . 
  now , he explains how it is `` understandable '' and `` logic '' that russia feels threatened by being surrounded by nato countries , which is true . 
  but i fail to see how a humanist who spent his life criticizing imperialism could consider that russia should have the right to surround itself by client states . 
  it 's not something specific to this sub . 
  for example , it 's more or less [ noam chomsky ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/09/noam-chomsky-who-rules-the-world-us-foregin-policy ) 's position , which paradoxically is shared by some far right europeans like marine le pen , and the russian government . 
  for all of them , what eastern europeans are wanting is irrelevant . 
  it could be an interesting perk in the game . 
   i highly , highly doubt ea said `` do n't put the french in . 
  i do n't have any trouble imagining ea saying `` do n't put the french in , keep them for the first dlc '' . 
  the article written published by cato seems riddled with ideology in its second half . 
  it goes to a long way to explain how `` exports are good , imports are better '' , and how bigger imports than exports cause a higher standard of living for the inhabitants of a country . 
  it 's kind of strange considering that switzerland , germany , the netherlands , denmark , ireland , japan during the 1970 's and the 1980 's , south korea , taiwan , italy after wwii , china today achieved a higher standard of living through higher exports . 
  it is highly unlikely that they could have achieved the same results through much higher imports than exports . 
  there are countries which have a more balanced position and rising living standard . 
  still , the position of the us is rather unique , almost only shared by the uk . 
  i think that you hit the nail on the head with your '' ( non-macroeconomist ) understanding '' though . 
   the biggest fall in output came from the basic iron and steel sector which saw production drop in march by 37.3 % percent compared with a year earlier . 
  if only we had some kind of pan european organization which the british government could use to protect its industry against chinese dumping ... 
  the thing is that i do n't understand how it can be sustainable for decades , alongside what some call the `` waiter-bartender recovery '' . 
  it 's fine currently because of the dollar , but it seems to be the main cause in shifting the balance of power with china . 
  on the other hand , i do n't get how it could be sustainable in the long term for the uk . 
  [ also , what is concerning is the balance of payments , not really the trade balance . 
  i mentioned the trade balance because of the expression of `` trouncing '' the european economy . 
  germany `` trounced '' southern europe through a massive trade surplus . 
  i do n't get how a massive trade deficit could achieve the same result . ], 
  their trade balance did n't improve , nor did the uk 's trade balance , which is strange if they are really `` trouncing '' the continental european countries . 
  it makes their growth suspicious , especially in the case of the uk . 
  the problem in the eurozone is n't about its competitiveness , it 's about its lack of demand . 
   the us even now is massively trouncing europe outside of maybe the uk what does that mean ? 
  i think you are spot on on the ttip , but i do n't know if it 's really in the best interests of the eurozone as a whole . 
  there could be other consequences such as germany actually benefitting from increased exports toward the us , whereas southern europe falls even lower than today thanks to the american competition . 
  this is especially obvious if we grossly imagine that the us gets to export its agricultural products , destroying the european agricultural sectors , which are especially important for france and southern european countries , in exchange for more manufactured goods , mainly coming from germany and the likes . 
  also , even if the eurozone becomes a kind of a bigger germany , how could the world economy work if china and the eurozone ( or the eu as a whole ) are both export-oriented , with only the us being consumption-oriented ? 
  this seems unsustainable and structurally flawed . 
   for all the shit those unions get , and they deserve some of it , the truth is that in many countries most teachers are underpaid . 
  the key issue is teachers ' social status , in which the pay is an important element but not everything . 
  in finland for example , the teachers ' pay is n't that high , especially in comparison to germany , but the social status is still high , therefore the job is attractive . 
  in spain , the wage is high ( higher than in supposedly richer countries like france or sweden for example ) , thus i 'd guess that their social status is quite high but it 's not certain . 
  maybe a spaniard could enlighten me . 
  in every high performing country in education like finland , singapore , south korea , japan et alii , teachers enjoy a high social status . 
  the opposite would be the us where teachers are looked down a lot . 
   high school and primary teachers are usually a joke , basically cause they work for the goverment so they can not get fired . 
  the situation is the same in many countries which are n't suffering the same consequences of a high dropout rate . 
  therefore , it 's probably not the main cause . 
  we should set up a g8 summit in corsica to bait them , then put the island under quarantine , and watch the natives taking care of them . 
  the money is n't really parked on a bullshit island . 
  most of it is actually parked [ around us ] ( http://www.private-eye.co.uk/registry ) . 
  those islands are merely a smokescreen . 
  you are right , western european nations ' pride is like schr\u00f6dinger 's cat : if you want to witness their `` lack of pride '' , you 'll witness their lack of pride ; if you want to witness their `` excessive and misplaced pride '' , you 'll witness their excessive and misplaced pride . 
  just look at those `` proudly made in britain '' ads in the uk or many brexiters ' arguments , the way french people will defend the french language and culture and the supposed universal philosophical values which are the revolution 's legacy , or the way germans often think about their cars or any german made products , their supposed superior work ethic etc. 
  jan b\u00f6hmermann put it well when he said that germans are `` proud of not being proud '' . 
   you 're only seeing nationalism as a danger i 'm not , because imo nationalism is useful as it gives a sense of community as you said . 
  a total lack of nationalism is also a problem . 
  a middle ground needs to be found . 
  the rule of law is a great way to moderate the excess of nationalism . 
  i 'm just saying that nationalism is n't risk-free , which is why people should be wary and should n't abdicate their critical thinking about nationalism . 
  hell is paved with good intentions . 
  the rule of law mainly and being wary of nationalism 's dangers . 
  also , it 's a clich\u00e9 but mainstream western europeans are supposed to look at the us ( i.e. 
  : the bible belt , not san francisco ) and find them backward on social issues like religion or abortion . 
  poland is closer to the bible belt than to san francisco in that respect . 
  yes , the perception of eastern europe has changed during the last decade . 
  the level of development is obviously much higher than during the 1990s . 
  also , people in western europe are now more aware of the differences between eastern european countries ( albeit still filled with stereotypes ) : estonia seems modern , lithuania and latvia seems slightly less modern but fine overall , slovenia is fine , romania seems to come from the 19th century but is really improving ( famous example : dacia ) etc. . . talking from a french point of view , the real criticism is aimed primarily at poland , hungary , and secondarily at the czech republic and slovakia ( both of them are rarely discussed though ) , because you seem aggressive and selfish . 
  a significant part of the population does n't seem to be really believing in what we consider as european values , but is faking it . 
  that 's the big difference between for example poland and hungary today , in comparison to spain and portugal during the 1980s . 
   it\u00e1lia also seems like a nice place that 's an understatement . 
  thanks , i should have looked for it myself . 
  strangely enough , i just did and could n't find a single article published in a french newspaper talking about a supposed british nostalgia for its empire , or the uk wanting it back . 
  considering that we have a similar legacy to you regarding colonization , albeit smaller , this idea would probably have appeared stupid to any respectable french journalist . 
  i 've still found an occasional german article though , and many us articles . 
  it screams of projection to me . 
   if a country 's media was an accurate representation of its people then all countries in the world would pretty much despise each other . 
  not really . 
  british newspapers , outside of the few respectable ones , are a special matter . 
  estimates have varied on that . 
  some historians go up to 60 % , like benedictow , others go down to 30 % , usually in older studies . 
  true , edited . 
  is n't the author flailing at a straw man though ? 
  i 've never seen anybody arguing on the fact that the uk wanted to go back to having an empire , or that being obsessed with it led to brexit . 
  what i 've seen is people saying that the leave campaign was led by a `` little englander '' mentality . 
  even during the 18th and 19th century , those deemed `` little englander '' were opposed to colonization . 
  there were no such thing as trump 's * maga * , but much more narrow stuff like `` get our money back '' , `` take back control '' , and `` let 's run ourselves '' . 
  that 's the * black death * . 
  around 50 % of europe 's population died in a few years around 1350 . 
  england got off relatively easily losing `` only '' around 30 % of its population , whereas italy and southern france lost 75 % of their population . 
  ireland got hurt by the famine , which has been followed by massive emigration . 
  actually , even scotland 's and wales ' populations have been multiplied by 4 or 5 in a century , which is a boom . 
  then their growth slowed down after ww1 . 
   civil disobedience in the face of laws you deem illegitimate is a thing , think of m\u00e9lenchon disobedience as the same thing at the eu level . 
  it 's completely different , because we are talking about international law , not national law . 
  national law exists thanks to a force of coercion . 
  international law exists thanks to trust and goodwill . 
  national law does n't only work because people that have to follow it freely decide to follow it . 
  there 's a force of coercion that enforces the law , which is why it is law and not just some kind of ethics : the police and the judicial power .

  ca n't really backpedal on that , since you supported that yourself . 
  also , if the cuneiform tablet part went over your head , you 've deliberately limited media into videos of a shooting , not a per-cursor , not a relatively non-violent conflict , not an article . 
  you 're not so much interested in truth , as you set a condition . 
  i 'm actually curious about the clinton supporter thing , because the shooter seemed to have been a religious fanatic . 
  why do n't you bother looked for and showing the nightclub footage if it exists ? 
  do n't bother posting it though , i 'm not interested in sharing in your morbid fascination . 
  yes , yes , because like the mosque shooting in canada or what i linked , whenever they commit violence they 're suddenly not a trump supporter . 
  or men who show up at protests with guns . 
  http://www.startribune.com/scarsella-guilty-of-assault-riot-in-2015-protest-shooting/412476503/ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0gta-rkbwf8 also , do you expect there to be a mass shooting on video ? 
  i do n't think macron is an idiot and viewing some of the other commenters , i 'll guess that the reasons are : 1 ) political : this is a maneuver to court the right . 
  2 ) it 's an intermediary step : it has to be a month , before being a year or years . 
  depending on whether it 's popular or not , national service time will be escalated . 
  3 ) for `` national unity '' : as he said it himself , this measure was to get every citizen to get a taste of military life , in the hopes that it would better integrate everyone / grow some sense of nationalism . 
  4 ) a militia/ground for immediate conscription : this is my most pessimistic answer , it 's because of the same reason that the swedish are re-instating their military service . 
  due to the actions of some of the superpowers and the threat of the possible dissolution of nato , it 's been judged that getting extremely basic military training was necessary . 
  it 's not enough to train any soldiers , but it 's enough to quickly get conscripts for national defense . 
  this is a consequence of the saber-rattling that 's been occurring lately , resources are spent ( arguably wasted ) on national defense because no nation wants to be caught militarily unprepared . 
  there : http://www.cnn.com/2016/12/16/politics/donald-trump-supporters-vicious-violent/ http://time.com/4254801/donald-trump-protest-violence-video/ from the mouth of the man himself . 
  i 'm sure however that you 'll ask for cuneiform tablets of it afterwards . 
  good , but i 'm not saying that . 
  acknowledging that the crimes of nazis could be committed by other people , does not diminish germany and germans role in it . 
  it was n't the fault of the jewish or of any of their other victims . 
  it was the fault of the germans . 
  however , we as human beings are n't too different . 
  the french and other nations collaborated to a lesser extent , and other genocides have occurred . 
  huttu vs tutsu , ottomans vs armenians . 
  i just want acknowledgement of this part of the human condition . 
  the americans saved much of europe during wwii , but that does not mean that the situation ca n't change . 
  i want a professional , i would have preferred someone who 's actually competent . 
  that you say he should be able to `` have his games '' as if you were speaking of a spoiled kinder-gardener is revelatory . 
  if you believe that 's the only alternative to a puppet , something which is n't even true , than republics are wasted on you ironically enough . 
  i have visited vietnam , more bombs were dropped on it than the whole of wwii , until some of it looked like the surface of the moon . 
  the water was fouled by their chemicals and men , woman and children were burned alive . 
  in iraq , in their foulest prisons people were tortured in some of the greatest mockeries of human rights . 
  the british , the russians and the french also have their own share of crimes as well . 
  do n't try to argue with emotional appeals against me , it will not work . 
  i say poor germans , because that part of history will never be washed away , that while they enjoy the fruits of their labor now they will still always have the shadows of germany 's crimes on the country , perhaps as it should be . 
  the lesson that should have been learned from the holocaust and germany 's wars against it 's neighbors however , should have been about the evils that rest in men 's heart . 
  how easy it is for atrocities to be justified and institutionalized so quickly . 
  the lesson should have been to be wary on certain type of politics , instead of focusing on the pure nationalities . 
  the latter of which ironically enough , the nazis did . 
  edit : i say this not as a hatred of all americans , but as a warning against complacency . 
  political reality can change very quickly . 
  i really appreciate this series . 
  the pictures you pick are often quite beautiful . 
  i do n't think relying on someone 's incompetence to save us from their viciousness is sound , especially since he 's not doing this aimlessly , this is the core of many of his policies . 
  also , poor germans . 
  even as someone who is very well aware of history , that 's a pretty cold thing to say . 
  i almost want to ask which country you 're from or what your circumstances are for you to hate them this much . 
  the ones i know personally are completely lovely . 
  the americans have also razed vietnam and massacred civilians in iraq , that 's not indicative of every single american , of course , but like all people in this world they are capable of committing extreme evil . 
  self-righteousness also goes hand in hand with moral myopia and believing that one is immune to evil is one of the biggest requirements for it . 
  so far , the main arguments against is that trump is incompetent , i 'm allowed to criticize him ( not surprising since i do n't live nearby ) and that the us 's social and political structure wo n't allow him to topple it . 
  the last one is the only reassuring one , but that does n't mean he 's not dangerous , it just means we hope that he and his supporters wo n't get more power . 
  `` the us is n't against environmentalism '' they said . 
  i sure hope they wo n't be able to pull everyone else down with them . 
  i 'm still voting for him even with that and i do n't exactly like the proposal to reinstate military service . 
  in terms of political pragmatism , it 's something that we 'll have to campaign against afterwards . 
  trump has popular support and he was all for re-instating more torture , as well as race/religion based policies . 
  there is no inherent difference in moral fiber that prevents an american from committing the same atrocities as a german . 
  it is arrogant to assume one country is immune to such descent in barbarity . 
  the last phrase of yours resonates with me however , a dictator can have many many supporters . 
  popularity does not equal goodness . 
  i 'm not exactly happy about this , even if it 's for one month . 
  we already have a day and i do n't see the benefits . 
  i do n't see the reason why marcon would do this , it seems to be a policy that came out of nowhere . 
  that 's neither here or there , because this was n't about germany , it was about the us . 
  my point still holds true , it 's trying to ignore the criticism of trump by pushing the guilt button for germany . 
  i have to keep that saying in mind whenever a series of small rational actions lead to a ridiculous total . 
  you know , i would agree with you except ; remember every time the far-right called for the death of liberals and said they were traitors ? 
  how does it feel now that a lot of europeans think you lot are puppets of other powers and are committing treason to every single european value ? 
  remember how you lot said that all of the muslims or any groups should have collective punishment , how you jumped for any chance to denigrate any group ? 
  how does it feel now that far-right extremist is the second one on the list of usual suspects for mass shootings ? 
  an eye for an eye turns the whole world blind , but if you use hatred as a tool , do n't expect anything else than that in return . 
  the son is not representative for the father , but it 's damn hard to not fall towards the standard you 've lot have set for discussion . 
  with the year we 've had , i 'll really need a drink ... 
  you advocated it , and when pressed on how vile torture is , you said it was n't going to happen . 
  when it was said that even suggesting it was vile , you switched subjects . 
  you are morally bankrupt . 
  there 's nothing else to say . 
  edit : also how did the iraq work out ? 
  guess the moralizing should sometimes be listened to . 
  i ca n't talk about science because to quote : `` he 's also against vaccination and environmentalism and all that more made up nonsense . 
  you people ca n't help yourselves , can you ? '', 
  you said that vaccines were made-up , then promptly switched , conveniently forgetting climate change ( which is basic knowledge for earth sciences and climate history ) . 
  structure of sentences and inferences from such is from basic english composition . 
  although it 's still nice to have the acknowledgement that it 's so moronic that the only way you can keep that double think working is by saying it 's my joke . 
  it 's convenient , is n't it ? 
  finally , you pretend to care for the environment , by mentioning the accident then go directly into saying it 's not necessary and once again conveniently ignore the part about censorship . 
  it 's rich to talk about fiscal responsibility while building a gigantic expensive wall as a vanity project . 
  it 's almost funny how brazen your dishonesty is , you have to cut apart the post of the person you 're directly quoting and responding to . 
  especially , when i posted sources in a post right above that . 
  funny how common we are in the european board are n't we ? 
  torture and torturers are vile , and i thought we got that clear after the bush era . 
  i also forgot about the general state of scientific education in the us for a second . 
  seeing as you 're an anti-vaccer there 's really no point to this , is there ? 
  funny thing , the whole `` it was a joke '' thing falls flat with what you said in the previous sentence and with what trump 's doing now . 
  sort of hard to say you 're all for the truth when the trump administration is censoring and de funding the american census bureau , the epa and the center for disease control . 
  edit : not going to comment on your debunked `` he did n't say that '' argument you had ? 
  it 's really the narcissists mantra with him .

  the issue is where do you draw the line ? 
  why do you compare a district of paris with a full city like monaco ? 
  you could also take a high residential building , and divide its number of residents with its surface area , you 'd get a crazy number . 
  paris has a much higher population density than other european capitals , because it kept its ( small ) historic borders , for instance ... 
  it does n't mean it 's * that * dense .

  [ i see a lot of thumbnails on the / r/europe page ... actually this submission is one of the only ones that does n't have one .

  actually , studies show that there are less accident on unlit highways ...

  the [ blue banana ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/blue_banana ) is very apparent . 
  northern italy and belgium are part of the [ blue banana ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/blue_banana ) . 
  this is all a matter of population density ... 
  honestly given how shitty the eurovision is , i 'm pretty sure the lower you are the better it is :p, 
  who cares , it happened centuries ago ? 
  we can also cry over latin . 
  it 's not regional languages at this point , it 's dead languages . 
  come on , they 're all dead . 
  this exactly . 
  the population of the us in 1770 was 2,148,076 , i.e. 
  basically the population of latvia now ... 
  i disagree . 
  interesting how you got a downvote for this . 
  it seems that a lot of people on this subreddit * really * want to believe there are a lot of occitan speakers . 
   in the south east , i believe that the public tv france 3 has a few programs in proven\u00e7al . 
  we do have it , yes !, 
  but it 's completely artificial , it 's like when they add breton classes in school . 
  the people who speak in france 3 proven\u00e7al are not native speakers , they are passionate people who learned proven\u00e7al and make a few tv shows . 
  it 's fun to watch though ( they subtitle it in french , of course ) . 
  these things are pretty funny , it 's like how they add the proven\u00e7al names of streets on street signs in nice even though nobody uses them . 
  it 's for the * couleur locale * . 
   even english is still diverging : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/northern_cities_shift this is more about accents than dialects . 
  there is no proof whatsoever this translates into emerging dialects . 
   dialect levelling occurs within numerous languages : [ 2 ] http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dialect_leveling `` dialect levelling or dialect leveling refers to the assimilation , mixture and/or eradication of certain dialects , often due to language standardisation '' . 
  this is the exact opposite of what you 're trying to prove . 
   linguists really do n't think constant media and communication has that much of an effect on language . 
  a nice book to read is dialects in contact by peter trudgill  here 's how a really informed linguist thinks american english will change over the next millennium : http://www.xibalba.demon.co.uk/jbr/futurese.html argument from authority much ? 
  two linguists think one thing , yes . 
  others think the opposite . 
  what does it prove ? 
   / r/linguistics if you want to learn . 
  i 've been on / r/linguistics for years , thank you very much . 
   please learn :-d that 's very smug for a random set of links that mostly prove that you ca n't think on your own . 
   think of how english differs in different regions of the world . 
  that does n't sound like a convincing argument at all . 
  english was different in different regions of the world before globalization . 
  have the differences between local versions of english * increased * in the past century ? 
  i find that hard to believe , it 's probably the opposite . 
   arabic has a written standard - msa - but the spoken versions are very different from one another . 
  same thing here , these versions split before globalization . 
  i doubt that if you take , say , tunisian arabic , it 's going to split into two different languages over the course of the next century . 
   dialects will continue to form even in today 's interconnected world . 
  do you have any examples of dialects that appeared recently ? 
  that evolved over the past one or two centuries ? 
  i ca n't think of one . 
   sure , smaller languages might die out , but the big ones are n't going anywhere . 
  on this i agree , i do n't think we 'll have a single language anytime soon ( or ever , really ) . 
  i doubt that national languages are going to disappear . 
  if you take france , or romania , for instance , i 'm pretty sure french and romanian will keep existing for a very long time . 
  now , will new distincts dialects appear in france or romania over the course of the next few centuries ? 
  i do n't think so . 
  we rely way more on written language now , and you do n't really have isolated regions in the globe anymore since we have fast transportation and telecommunications ... 
  the reason why languages used to diverge was because they were mostly oral dialects and every town was isolated from other ones , so over centuries , languages tended to evolve separately even in locations that were sort of close . 
  not happening anymore . 
  yes , but these estimates do n't make any sense . 
  according to this , there is almost as many occitan speakers than there are arabic speakers in france . 
  just ask any french person - it 's very common to meet people who can speak arabic in france when you * never * meet someone who can speak occitan ... you 'll notice that the study they used is 15 years old , and ca n't be found anywhere ( `` citation needed '' ) ... 
  it is always the same study that people cite on the internet , recursively quoting each other , without anyone being able to find it , apparently . 
  i tell you that the language is basically dead . 
  yes , maybe you can find a handful of very old people in very remote villages who know some occitan ( although i 'm even doubtful about this ) , but then you can probably find more japanese speakers in france . 
  you never reach a full zero with anything , hell , there are probably even people who learned latin well enough that they can speak it fluently in france . 
  does that mean latin is still alive ? 
  there are n't even any reliable estimates about how many occitan speakers there are , and i believe the ones that exist are gross overestimates . 
  surely having lived in southern france for most of my life and never having met an occitan speaker or talked with people who told me they knew one means something ? 
  where ? 
  never met any . 
   it 's inevitable that we all speak one language someday . 
  i 'm doubtful about that one , 
  yep , from what i understand , the uk is similar to france in this regard . 
  it 's not uncommon to meet italians who can speak a local dialect as well as standard italian though , for instance . 
  does it make sense to you to protect a language that has died and is artificially revived through school , though ? 
  why do n't we do this with latin , then ? 
  it all seems very artificial and pointless to me . 
  the french already have a hard time learning another language than french ( english , for instance ) , let 's not waste our resources on dead languages . 
  what a lot of foreigners do n't seem to realize is that the situation of regional languages in france is very different from what it is in other european countries . 
  i 'm always surprised when i meet people from italy , spain , germany , etc. , and they tell me that they can speak a local dialect ... 
  in france these languages are basically dead , and they have been for a long time . 
  i 've lived in southern france for 22 years , and i 've never met * a single person * in my life who could speak occitan .

  if you think trump is going to do anything because some obscure newspaper in europe is mean to him , you probably do n't have a very good grasp of reality . 
   i call this behavior bullyism , only beat who 's weaker . 
  remember when ch literally made fun of the people who * actually * shot up their office ?

  are you really uninformed about what collaboration was ? 
  there is nothing wrong with trying to not get killed , in fact that 's what most people did all over france . 
  however some french people went `` above and beyond '' . 
  for example by reporting their neighbors for being jews or resistants , or by willingly joining the militia to happily take part in the oppression of their own people . 
  those who did such things were traitors and they deserved to pay . 
  anyone arguing against it ... 
  i do n't want anything to do with them . 
   most of europe still thinks the roi is in the uk and you got that from an obviously silly map of stereotypes ? 
  how little you must think of us .

  first it 's important to understand that many people voted * against * sarkozy and not * for * hollande in 2012 , so he started his term with a part of his electorate already unconvinced . 
  he failed to keep the others convinced by being kind of mediocre and uninspiring overall , despite a few good points ( like legalising gay marriage ) . 
  his administration passed some quite controversial bills , such as surveillance and especially the new labor code . 
  he has been called `` not socialist enough '' despite being from that party . 
  the wave of terrorism has n't helped , even though it 's not his fault . 
  he probably suffered the consequences for some of sarkozy 's bullshit too . 
  to right wingers , he 's anything from an incompetent pussy to the antichrist and root of all evil .

   if my theory of relativity is proven successful ... france will declare me a citizen of the world . 
  should my theory prove untrue , france will say that i am a german what does that mean ? 
  why does he bring up france of all countries ? 
  it does n't matter which country makes what official , nobody cares which word their government tells them to use . 
  the fact is neither the brits nor us are going to use `` czechia/tch \u00e9quie '' more , regardless of what is official in our respective countries . 
  when it comes to language , no amount of official rulings beats popular use . 
  french allows both , but i 've never heard or read tch\u00e9quie anywhere . 
  personally i do n't like how it sounds and will probably keep saying `` r\u00e9publique tch\u00e8que '' . 
   why do english speakers keep finding in slavic words vowels which do not exist there happens to anyone who reads a long word , in a foreign language , with unusual associations of letters ( like dn or vsk for most non-slavs ) . 
  add to that ignorance of the pronounciation rules which may or may not apply , and it takes no more for the brain to activate the `` big scary foreign word '' alert and hinder the ability to use intuition and decompose the word into manageable pieces . 
  honestly , you ca n't fault the qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois for not being very keen on the british crown . 
  it must suck being a republican trapped under monarchy in your own country , and a foreign monarchy at that .

  again , what do you make of gun and drug violence ? 
  calais citizens do n't have to fear being shot by anyone . 
  and will you adress my claim that for most of them it 's counterproductive to draw the attention of police for reasons other than trying to get smuggled ? 
  you picked one of the most notoriously unsafe cities of the us , it 's hard to believe you . 
  everything that 's said about detroit ( particularly by americans themselves ) is quite a lot for one person to dismiss like it 's nothing . 
  it 's similar , but our ghettos are probably worse and more dangerous for them . 
  overall cops are n't seen very positively by the general population who tends to think of them more as enforcers/punishers than protectors . 
  however , they have the public on their side when they are stretched too thin , not supported enough by the government , or when they are attacked by thugs like in the recent molotov cocktail incident . 
   even detroit is a 5 star spa resort compared to that this is where you cross the `` major bullshit '' line . 
  detroit has a high crime rate , actual ghettos within the city , urban decay . 
  calais has none of that . 
  migrants definitely cause troubles and crime , but it 's ridiculous to compare it to detroit where there are guns , murders , muggings and drug trade . 
  they 're trying to get into the uk , it 's generally not in their interest to draw the attention of the police more than necessary . 
  easy there .

  * no , this would be completely illegal in france .

   `` fairer '' who decides what is fairer ? 
  there 's a clear definition of what constitutes meritocracy . 
  no need to head off on a red scare tangent . 
   with the end of european union membership , ( greening ) said , it would become an economic necessity to make better use of all young people 's abilities . 
  that would be a very welcome outcome of brexit . 
  let 's hope the tories pay more than lip service to the idea . 
  quite similar here ( south of paris ) . 
  the magnolias and cherry blossom were at their peak last week , the apple blossom and pear blossom are at their best this week , lilacs are visible but have not opened yet . 
    she 'd use it to exert moral pressure on london . 
   which she ca n't do legally what ? 
  of course she can . 
  or are you saying that she ca n't organise a referendum legally ? 
  she 'll just call it something else - like a citizens ' consultation or something . 
   she 's used her last trump card remindme !, 
  18 months . 
  i think she has several more moves planned . 
  organising a referendum ! = declaring independence unilaterally . 
  she 'd use it to exert moral pressure on london . 
  yes . 
  i 'm hoping for some sort of ` special economic zone ' to allow cross-border activity to continue . 
  otherwise the dairy industry is in trouble on both sides of the border . 
  this is the quotation i could find :  `` the negotiations must first clarify how we will disentangle our interlinked relationship , '' the german chancellor said in berlin . 
  `` only when this question is dealt with can we -- hopefully soon after -- begin talking about our future relationship . '' this was interpreted by the uk press as `` merkel refuses may 's request for parallel talks '' , but it could be understood as `` we need to begin exit talks first , agree on the principles , then we can talk about the future '' . 
   anything is better than central planning and the government owning everything . 
  not sure why you 're supporting the fn in that case . 
  they 're significantly more * dirigiste * than the mainstream parties in france . 
   are now mostly treated like shit by the rest of their country . 
  i lived in lille * for several years , but i never got the impression that the rest of france treated lille as badly as the rest of belgium treats wallonia . 
  ( * great city by the way . 
  lovely people . ), 
   different reason but same cause : not enough trust . 
    i have to re-look again about what i posted previously yeah i think it was france asking the us not to spy on france , rather than vice versa . 
  the request will be ignored . 
  sturgeon will reiterate it several times . 
  at some point late next year she 'll say `` enough is enough . 
  we need to organise our own referendum without waiting for permission . '', 
   no , they have no legal ability to do so without the uk government authorising it i reckon sturgeon will go ahead and organise one without westminster 's permission . 
  it 's the logical move . 
  the steep roof lets snow slide off before it builds up and gets so heavy that the roof collapses . 
  and on the 7th day they rested . 
  may he sedition hush , and like a torrent rush , rebellious scots to crush . 
  god save the queen !, 
   dude , there were dozens of attacks a year dozens of attacks on pubs in britain ? 
  no there were n't . 
  you 're explaining the surveillance society in the uk based on incidents in 1974 . 
  but what have you done for me recently ? 
  the continuance of your aristocracy shouts louder than your potted history of rights dispersal among the powerful . 
  i never said a `` unique authority '' , just ~ ~ obsequiousness ~ ~ obedience to authority . 
  you 're saying that some pub bombings in 1974 are the basis for the british public 's acquiescence to being the most heavily monitored people in europe , and about third in the world after north korea and singapore . 
  let 's think about this . 
  when did mass surveillance start ? 
  the telecoms bill of 1984 ( iirc ) . 
  so 10 years after pub bombings that affected two towns in britain . 
  when did mass surveillance get ratcheted up ? 
  off the top of my head there were bills in 1990 , 1996 , 2000 , and 2004 . 
  are you really saying that events in two towns in 1974 made british people compliant with the constant erosion of civil and privacy rights over 1990-2004 ? 
  again , that 's barmy . 
  were you even born in 1974 ? 
  til that germany = `` most continental countries '' . 
  the british lower classes have , by and large , obeyed their betters and they continue to do so . 
  look at your ruling party . 
  have fewer spies ? 
  fucked if i know . 
  do n't really care either . 
   i did n't say `` the second a bombing occurred mass surveillance began '' no , but you very clearly do n't know much about the ira pub bombings if you really think that explains acquiescence to surveillance . 
  brave shopkeeper . 
  hope the cowardly fucks who attacked him get done for attempted murder . 
   we have less of a fear of our government . 
  you also have a stronger tradition of obedience to authority than most continental countries . 
   when you live under the looming threat of your pub being bombed , knowing gchq might be looking at private details does n't seem such a big deal the pub bombings in britain happened in 1974 . 
  mass surveillance did n't really start until the 1980s . 
  if the uk wo n't share , the eu wo n't have a choice . 
  does n't matter if it takes 10 years or 100 years . 
  like i said , it 's a good way to start making gchq irrelevant . 
   a good way to start, 
  amber rudd : an idiot in search of a village . 
  cameron should be remembered for making the tories electable again , for dealing an almost fatal blow to the libdems , and for several socially progressive pieces of legislation . 
  instead , he 's the equivalent of the trojan guy who decided it 'd be a good idea to roll the big wooden horse inside the city gates just before nightfall . 
  seems like a good way to start making british intelligence services less relevant to the rest of europe . 
  some strategically placed explosives around ballyshannon and donegal could become ( mostly ) an island in its own right . 
  no , i mean how will the trade deal for nz butter be better than the current terms with nz ? 
  and does n't the uk produce plenty of butter anyway ? 
  this is the same politician who recently said :  [ it was `` completely unacceptable '' that the government could not read messages protected by end-to-end encryption ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/mar/26/intelligence-services-access-whatsapp-amber-rudd-westminster-attack-encrypted-messaging ) because , y' know , we should be building encryption systems that are accessible to the good guys ... 
   may might try to use the uk 's security engagement in europe as a bargaining chip that would be a very cynical approach , imo . 
  yep , it 's in the current government 's sights . 
  the 0.7 % target is particularly galling to some tories . 
   trade deals will us/can/aus / nz will kick in to help the consumer . 
  what will you trade with the us/can/aus / nz that will help the consumer ? 
  how will the trade deal be better than current terms ? 
   why would european companies be encouraged to buy british gas turbines , chemicals or iron products , if they can get german or french ones , within the common market ? 
  i 've been wondering about this since last june . 
  even without any tariffs , british products will have to be very attractively priced to compete from outside the common market . 
   it 's another example of how london is actually a hostage to incredible freedoms that the european union has granted to its members -- and yet it fails to acknowledge that . 
  i 'd say `` westminster '' rather than `` london '' , because i think that the capital city has acknowledged repeatedly that it benefits from and would prefer to retain eu membership . 
  maybe some younger academics and researchers will leave , depending on how joint research projects with the eu pan out . 
  i 've read about a lot of projects that could be jeopardized if no deal is reached , and for some of the leads on these projects it will make sense to move to an eu location to continue working .

  mighty craic to be had by all . 
  southern ireland = the people 's republic of cork and the kingdom of kerry .

  there are more laws in regards to shipping than there is towards land vehicles . 
  regardless of whether you 're from the left or the right , you have to be a fucking moron to be using a ship as if you can just steer it anywhere . 
   she gets actively stalked and intimidated by antifa . 
  some of her fellow journalists actually got beaten at the g20 protests . 
  still not a good excuse for trying to do something this stupid . 
  i got doxxed many years ago . 
  does n't mean that i can just put fireworks up my asshole . 
  it turns out that alt-right memelords have no understanding of maritime laws . 
  who would 've thought ? 
  seriously , they should replace bulls with robots . 
  the spanish gov. 
  should give contracts to boston dynamics just to build robot bulls . 
  more humane , and could create tons of jobs in spain . 
  you can even institute kill switch unlike a real bull . 
  not really . 
  many indians , bangladeshis and pakistanis can live and work as commonwealth nationals . 
  i 'm from malaysia and we have visa rights to work in the uk . 
  yeah , go ahead and blame eu migrants instead of non-eu migrants and employers profiting from it . 
  well quebecois always underestimate the potential of the french language outside quebec . 
  all my quebecois said that french is useless outside france , quebec and africa which is not true . 
  too bad the quebecois does n't support france 's francophone beliefs . 
  yes a jew is trying to islamise europe . 
  that makes sense, 
  disappoint, 
  yes , finally tv5monde will get the proper funding it deserves to compete with bbc america/world !, 
  at last , the polish caliphate under the guidance of caliph abu durda al-warsawi is born !, 
  too bad i do n't see masha i medved ' conventions in la or paris similar to animeexpo and japanexpo . 
  hell , when was the last time tatu , eduard khil or even emin had a concert outside russia/eastern europe/the urals ? 
  also , the best videogames about russia ( stalker shadow of chernobyl , metro ) are made by ukrainians . 
  that actually kind of says something . 
  also , why was burnt by the sun 2 even made at all ? 
  i still ca n't believe that such a godawful sequel even existed . 
  it sucks that mikhalkov blew it . 
  well they 're literally beating dead horses and eventually everyone 's going to smell the horses ' corpses, 
  this is why russia 's soft power is a failure . 
  instead of coming up with their own cool fads and pop culture , they will instead demonise any form of pop culture and will waste their money trying to destroy it in russia . 
  meanwhile , japan is still making tourism money out of anime , korean movies are still winning film festivals , french food is still being taught in culinary schools , wonder woman is still a hit at the box office and despacito just reached no. 1 beyond spanish-speaking music charts . 
  it 's like they learned nothing from the cold war . 
  india is like 1/5th of the world that 's for sure . 
   oh yeah because every other country love their politicians . 
  / r/india still treats modi like it 's his victory in 2014 . 
  abu durda al-warsawi strengthens his supreme rule in his caliphate . 
  these thick of it + inbetweeners + peep show + black mirror crossover episodes are really getting out of hand . 
  i still hated the blonde fucker from season 5 onwards . 
  yeah , let 's kill half of the series ' cast just to let this one new terrible character live . 
  his character turned the series into the worst parts of the walking dead . 
   at first they were focused on their own little market and had no intent to export abroad well they had to in order to catch up with the japanese pop culture of the 1990s and also due to the fact that they 're neighboured with north korea whom they were trying to mediate with in the late 90s . 
  there is a concept called `` han '' in korean society which means `` feeling of unresolved resentment against injustices suffered , a sense of helplessness because of the overwhelming odds against one , a feeling of acute pain in one 's guts and bowels , making the whole body writhe and squirm , and an obstinate urge to take revenge and to right the wrong -- all these combined . '', 
  it 's a cultural response to 35 of japanese rule followed by 3 years of brotherly bloodshed torn apart by a global arms race . 
  that 's why many korean movies are about revenge or regret one way or another . 
  i do n't think that it 's a very unique thing considering how the indonesian action film industry has adopted korean cinema-style marketing and had a moderate success with stuff like the raid , headshot , halfworlds and a few more ( just go to the various the raid threads on / r/movies ) . 
  the anime industry also took the korean approach of fully embracing both its global niche audience and its social media unlike its j-drama and cinema counterparts , and the result is a huge revival and interest in the anime industry globally while cinema and live television are struggling in japan itself . 
  there 's like 6 to 7 seasons of une village francaise for you to check out . 
  it 's basically downton abbey except better since it 's set in wwii and it stars the vampire from the strain . 
  i want more au service de la france , please, 
  macron seems to be the type of guy who wants france to ape the whole `` korean wave phenomenon '' i wo n't be surprised if my asian mom starts getting addicted to the constant stream of french television dramas that appear on netflix in the next few years . 
  funny , because he could pass off as an uyghur muslim, 
  all hail the new polish caliphate led by abu durda al-warsawi, 
  damn that 's fucking weird, 
   from skimming through this , it seems much more serious than poland 's situation . 
  anyway , malaysia is always held up as an example of an exemplary muslim state , and now you are saying it 's a corrupt islamist extremist country ? 
  both the ruling party and opposition parties have been pandering to islamists for 3 decades now . 
  a lot of recent federal and state laws that were enacted were made to favour muslims . 
  [ ending judicial independence is a common thing in islamist governments ] ( https://www.hrw.org/news/2016/08/05/turkey-judges-prosecutors-unfairly-jailed ) [ pakistan has a history of it ] ( https://www.thenews.com.pk/archive/print/626817-judiciary-being-abused-with-impunity ) [ hell , the most controversial judiciary crisis in a common law country happened in malaysia in 1988 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1988_malaysian_constitutional_crisis ),

  schadenfreude is the greatest remain campaigner ever . 
  i 'm working for an ngo dealing with refugees right now and let me say this : not only do you have to teach them the language , but also teach them the etiquette . 
  you have to force them to assimilate if they want to survive . 
  they are scared of going back , and that 's the point . 
  force them to assimilate , or deport them . 
  it 's not hard , and there 's nothing racist or discriminatory about it . 
  even south korea sends back north korean refugees who refuse to abide to south korea . 
  this is why macron won, 
  basmati is also now a thing in my hometown in malaysia . 
  it 's also the most popular strand of rice in french pondicherry , martinique and reunion . 
  hr giger 's now a turkish chef ? 
  in my opinion , i think that paella of any kind is best made with basmathi rice similar to that of goan paella . 
  i just do n't like the rice used in normal paella . 
  in fact , basmati is such an underrated rice strain in europe . 
  making francophone recipes like thieboudienne/riz au gras with basmati is the greatest thing ever . 
  myanmar is a close ally of china and the genocide of the rohingya and karen peoples are also due to the sale of their lands by the government to chinese firms . 
  nobody wants the rohingyas , but myanmar is forcing them to flood the rest of southeast asia , bangladesh , canada and soon europe as a final `` fuck you '' to the international community from the ruling military junta . 
  from my pov this is also essential to prevent an upcoming flow of refugees from eastern ukraine , chechnya , xinjang and myanmar . 
  why is water wet ? 
  i wonder why this is not in / r/russia . 
  hmm ... ... 
  a great dictatorship is basically tito . 
  a mediocre dictatorship is ... . putin . 
  is this the upcoming dlc character for arms ? 
  so no difference between ? 
  it 's funny when japanese prime minister shinzo abe ( who 's also in the summit ) speaks decent english and he 's from a country that has less english speakers than turkey and france combined . 
  more like myanmar since the treatment of the kurds are similar to that of the rohingyas . 
  and myanmar also flooded southeast asia with rohingya refugees the same way they flooded europe with syrian refugees . 
  they tried to protest against milo yiannopoulus in berkeley and failed and yet it only took a youtube channel with 265 subscribers to burn his career to the ground . 
  the cuntiest cunt to ever cunt, 
  they look like nice people / s, 
  chamberlain tells germany to stop ` destabilising poland ', 
  myanmar is also holding southeast asia hostage by flooding in thousands of rohingya refugees to thailand , malaysia and indonesia and refusing to stop the violence against karen and rohingya minorities . 
  [ even dalai lama criticised suu kyi for her `` silence '' ] ( http://www.mizzima.com/news-international/dalai-lama-criticises-aung-san-suu-kyi-over-rohingya-silence-eu-meeting ), 
  so based on this guy 's logic i can just stroll around the gettysburg battlefield and film myself saying `` this is why we need an islamic caliphate .

  you ca n't check every person that enter the country . 
  clovis was n't a carolingian but a merovingian . 
  trump could have done the same , pointing at putin and asking the media . 
  nah , pretty much everyone would scream nazi , including many voters . 
   why do n't france do something ? 
  reddit would be the first to scream nazi if france did anything . 
  while they 're obviously scumbags , if i had to take pictures in the house of someone , especially someone rich , i 'd ask to prevent misunderstandings . 
   let 's put different colors for all parties except rem and modem so it 's looks good on the picture, 
  most of the parties were n't too far of the parity . 
  enough with this meme . 
  melenchon has collasped , that was expected for fn , you ca n't expect people to go voting when their votes wo n't matter . 
  there are already loads of polls since that scandal and it does n't show his numbers going down . 
  it does not threaten his potential majority, 
  that 's pretty much every battle on wikipedia , even with countries that did not participate . 
  if germany could say that to her coal plants . 
  endorsed by the center party , and by many people on the left and the right . 
  his party just came at the right time, 
  crashing this party ... ... with no survivors . 
  did n't know it was there on thursday , i would have gone there for sure . 
   look in ww1 , paris was saved by taxis . 
  that 's a meme . 
  yes the taxis helped bring some men , but they did not save paris . 
  but most importantly , thank you for being so incompetent that you 're an endless source of jokes . 
  from the media that probably spammed articles on how you shoud be scared, 
  yeah , but you wo n't have 30 more points of old people going to abstain like that . 
  while a few more points for the youth is more possible . 
  but they did . 
  just not so much . 
  the 66 % are not all votes because they trust the candidates . 
  if the youth did n't vote to block le pen , abstention would probably win other the two candidates . 
  just ban the independent at this point, 
  for the medias i can understand , even if i hate them for doing that . 
  but spamming articles for karma , fuck this . 
   the us voted against trump ( who won due to weird rules ) if the rules were differents , the votes would have been different . 
  maybe she would have won , maybe not . 
  reddit and fear-mongering is a love story, 
  it 's quite bad actually considering his opponent . 
   you claimed that historic members of fn were resistants . 
  you 're lying . 
   part of the historic members were resistants they were indeed resistants in the party . 
  and they were former nazis too . 
  being this angry at a fact . 
  i 'm not saying anything about the party . 
  but claiming fn is everything the resistants fought against when some resistants ( along with people you cited ) created it is ironic . 
  funny since part of the historic members ( of the fn ) were resistants . 
  we 're not the us .

  le pen was a close second in french guiana , and in r\u00e9union . 
  and not as close but still second in mayotte . 
  macron was second in martinique . 
  as i said in the first post , they wo n't accept they 're the problems and that they 're the one making fn grows . 
  so of course you expect them to rise . 
  meh , it 's nice for her but she hoped for much more , we know since years she would be at the second turn . 
  what we expected for a long time was that she would win the first turn with a nice margin . 
  she failed on that . 
  sure , but she wo n't win . 
  i 'm getting tired of the `` what if '' . 
  i do n't think so . 
  just macron acts like an idiot, 
  erdogan cheated though . 
  le pen wo n't win . 
  people will never accept to see that the last years were a total disaster . 
  easier to scream nazi and call the other people to block them by voting for you . 
  funny since russia is the reason armenia could n't end the war . 
  when you think that m. lassalle unexpectedly got his candidature validated ( m. asselineau was a surprise too ) and end up with the most votes of the little candidates , and that m. dupont-aignan was probably pressured to withdraw , the outcomes could really have be differents . 
  around 20 % of women , 24 % of men . 
  more than 50 % of police and military voted for her party in 2015 . 
  i did n't see any numbers for this election . 
  the big police syndicate/union called to vote macron to block marine . 
  ok mate , ca n't stenchon the melenchon right, 
  nah , recently maybe , i try to show them the truth , but they keep believing she can win . 
  you 'll have propaganda for two weeks , it already started on / r/france . 
  `` if you do n't think of voting because the others will do it you 're literally hitler '', 
  you get expenses reimbursed with less than 5 % , but ten times less . 
  he will save a few hundred thousands with this score . 
  pepper your angus mate, 
  just force them to learn polish , they will leave . 
  so what , take another one . 
  france will take rhineland with minimal casualties in your lifetime . 
  take your share poland . 
  sure it will affect the election , but in an irrelevant way and not  dramatically, 
   paris ( cnn ) a deadly attack on a police bus in the heart of paris has dramatically changed the course of the french presidential election campaign . 
  fuck off cnn . 
  you know nothing . 
  what a non-story . 
  they try to take this region by force . 
  even if karabakh is their territory de jure , they were still trying to take it by force . 
  who cares if he says liberate or take , that 's not worth a news story . 
  i do n't deny it but as i said . 
   websites make news on everything news do n't make something relevant . 
  this is a non-story . 
   huffingtonpost anyway websites make news on everything . 
  they are reimbursed even with less than 5 % . 
  but ten times less, 
  incompetent government, 
  who cares ? 
  there are a lot of polls and they tend to show the no win . 
  it really depends of the political affiliation . 
  do someone has a link of when they 're in france ?

  how could i even be an american ? 
  they think the french flag is white ... that being said , thank you for the compliments . 
  i think we 're both the type of people that have the common courtesy to give a reach around . 
  i am just admiring your people 's steadfastness and resolution . 
  anyone else would say : `` guys maybe we got it wrong ! '' . 
  but you just continue on the same path . 
  very inspiring . 
   could only be put off for so long . 
  what an exceptionally resilient people you brits are . 
  any other person would just be pissed for being poorer because of the folly of some nuts that wanted to stick it to downing st or because they thought there are too many poles . 
  but you guys just march on . 
  exceptional . 
   would n't making foreign goods more expensive mean that it will make more sense to make them in the uk instead ? 
  gon na buy me a british iphone . 
  or the way things are looking atm , a british note 7 . 
   `` if you do n't give , you and your loved ones wo n't get to heaven '' dude , i 'll love for you to show me exactly where that 's written . 
  or show me any official in the church that said that . 
  i 'm sure there 's some high ranking official that said such a dumb thing , but i bet you 'll enjoy finding them . 
   i would push the religious charlatans who get money from these people to not be allowed to get `` donations '' from people unless they have a minimum amount of earnings per month . 
  should we tell people they need to have a minimum amount of earnings if they wan na buy a dvd or a video game or a book . 
  because obviously if they ca n't put food on the table , they should n't be allowed to spend money in way that would deem beneficial for their well being . 
   standard fraud is punished by the law , but religions have been pulling stuff like this for ages , so it has become normality . 
  again what is the fraud ? 
  it 's their belief system and no actual priest will tell you your cancer will be cured if you pay so and so . 
  or you 'll win so and so money . 
  while it * might * happen , cases are few and far between . 
  people feel they are participating in something bigger than them . 
  it is not a sect , people do n't get shunned by family if they become atheists or whatever . 
  it 's a choice they make . 
  some people go on trips to see big buildings , a green statue or a huge antenna others go to see a corpse . 
  some people shed tears to a flag others to a cross . 
   just like with gambling and so on . 
  i doubt you 'll find any scientific study that found people addicted to donating ( to the church or any other people or institutions ) . 
  in the case of gambling the risk produces addiction . 
  there is an immediate reward to the penalty of giving away money . 
  when you donate , you have a feeling of worth and well being but not a feeling of addiction through strong reward . 
  unless you 're schindler or something and you 're directly saving human lives through your donations . 
  ninja edit : i see no difference between a concert goes and a pilgrim . 
  they all enjoy doing it because they 're part of a community , they all get they dehumanising , hive-mind experience through repetitive mouvement , singing , mass behaviours and mannerism ( jumping around in unison , singing when a random schmuck tells you to sing what and when , similar clothing styles ) , they all give money to people vastly more rich than them . 
  should we ban poor people from going to concerts ? 
  yeah you do . 
  you 've got hot wine and bbqs because it 's also the city holidays . 
  and you can go shopping for some artisanal clothing around the city because manufacturers come around . 
  dey terk his jerb, 
   it could be seen that assad is nominally the only thing holding the clusterfuck together . 
  is he really ? 
  can you look at the situation and think : wow lucky there 's assad there . 
  who knows what could have happened without . 
   you went there with the intention of deposing gaddafi , for your own political interests , and the moment the goal was accomplished you bail out , not caring for the mess you left behind . 
  i should have know better . 
  i know :'(, 
  so are you saying that lybia is worse off than syria ? 
   also note that for fiat chrysler there might be more to come . 
  yeah . 
  too soon to say what 'll happen . 
  huh . 
  til . 
  but it 's fair to mention that the case is n't over and up to now only involves 3 car models ( 500x , jeep renegade and another ) . 
  vw had installed this cheat in a ton of vws , audis and other cars . 
  the scale seems different . 
   also it is not like vw was the only car supplier cheating do you have examples of other eu manufacturers that installed software to cheat on emission tests ? 
   and i also remember how the french authorities were among the first to demand the forced elimination of assad yeah generally it 's not a good idea to support someone that used chemical weapons . 
  i also like that / u/mimo _ shel respected the rule of always mentioning the flair of the commenter even though it has no relevance to the topic !, 
   i 'm from germany , and i 've literally seen one project funded by eu money you must not be in academia . 
  i doubt that brexit has n't increased support for the eu . 
   eu funds are , , helping , , to not fight corruption , on contrary it supports corruption in basically all new member states and southern crisis hit states . 
  heard that speach from a serbian . 
  such a weird thing . 
  that 's what i mean . 
  a bad idea . 
  wtf is this ? 
  the middle ages where you tar and feather people ? 
  will they shame gs and jpm for hiring too many foreigners ? 
  or airbus ? 
  dumb laws . 
  probably . 
  still a bad idea to make that list public as it seems that it was one of the plans . 
   our country is n't a joke . 
  it 's not the best of times . 
  recently one of your mep knock the living lights out of another mep ( who in the spirit of showing hens a true brit started complaining about eating too many croissants in the hospital , but thatns not important now ) . 
   baguette i do . 
  with some confiture or something . 
   if you disagree with all their points except one , there 's no point in voting for them . 
  usually it 's never just one . 
  on the continent we simply are too integrated in the eu so trying to vote such policies in power automatically means economic suicide . 
  who on gods green earth would put their business data on drop box ? 
  ps : read too quickly your first message . 
  thought you said why do n't people learn to say it in english . 
  muh bad . 
  of course i do !, 
  it 's a plank . 
  trunk . 
  heck a whole friggin redwood : o, 
  do n't do n't let me start on the accent you english speakers have in a foreign language . 
  i have yet to met one that speaks perfectly clear . 
  i do not know how it 's possible . 
  are you people allergic to learning new languages or something ? 
   looser loser . 
  goddamit you have a british flair . 
  that 's what i also think of him but if you ask british to think of famous chefs , i 'm sure his name would crop up .

  in the space of a day , the schoolgirl became a citizen of the `` caliphate '' . 
  she is greeted on the spot by her future husband , eight years her senior . 
  under the mattress in her room , lea left a farewell letter : `` first of all , i apologize for the many spelling errors . 
  ( ... ) you do n't suspect this , but in 10 hours i will be gone . 
  gone from this country that prevents me from practicing my religion properly in freedom . 
  ( ... ) i have departed for sham , this holy city that is located in syria . 
  ( ... ) i left for a holy land where we will be resurrected on the day of resurrection . 
  i left because my happiness is to make my religion my life and have no constraints . 
  because dad refuses the hijab and you wo n't allow me to stop attending school . '', 
  l\u00e9a does n't know anything about sham - a region that dates back to the golden age of islam , rather than a city - nor her final destination , rakka , nor what to expect in syria : her flight has been controlled remotely . 
  the investigators of the anti-terrorism sub-directorate ( sdat ) and the directorate general of internal security ( rps ) quickly discover that she was in touch on facebook with a `` abu saad al maghrebi , '' a predator of the islamic state who 's originally from nimes ( southern france ) . 
  investigators also realize that l\u00e9a was in touch before leaving with several young women living in france . 
  among them , camille , 15 , enrolled in vocational school , lives in a small town in southern france . 
  neither her father , of algerian origin , nor her mother , from a catholic backaground , are practiticing . 
  eager to wear the full veil and settle in syria , she gradually radicalized herself on the internet . 
  since march 2014 she 's been subject to a ban on leaving the country . 
  at the other end of france , a second contact of l\u00e9a , juliette , 14 , comes from a blended family . 
  from a catholic background , she wears niqab and gloves , just one year after her conversion in a mosque in her region . 
  camille and juliette are interviewed by the police two days after the disappearance of l\u00e9a . 
  they admit being in contact with the girl but deny having encouraged her departure . 
  it 's a police investigation of a new kind . 
  a terrorist case within the confines of childhood , mental manipulation and the malaise of society . 
  the story of a group of girls torn between the troubles of adolescence and the pitfalls of a troubled era . 
  its protagonists are between 14 and 19 years . 
  from different regions of france , they got to know each other on facebook and have never met . 
  from middle class families that are not religious or not very religious , these five young girls found a complete ideology on the internet , a magical piece of software that has all the answers : radical islam . 
  behind their keyboards , they discussed for months with `` recruiters '' from the organization islamic state ( ei ) and together they maintained their deadly delusion . 
  two of them left for syria , the other three planned to commit an attack on french soil . 
  here is the story of their indoctrination . 
  their names and their geographic origins have changed . 
  lol , what a headline . 
  it 's a slowdown in growth , but growth continues . 
   that does n't mean we know everything about what will happen when the uk leaves , but it does mean that the status-quo ( and current direction of travel ) is a better propositin . 
  i do n't understand . 
  do you mean that the status quo is not a better proposition ? 
   but why do that at all when there is only downside for everyone involved . 
  there is downside for the uk ; i 'm not so sure for the eu ; again , we 'd need to consider whether intra-eu trade would replace imports from the uk . 
  the uk 's disadvantage is its distance from alternative suppliers - even applying a tariff to eu goods they might remain competitive relative to goods shipped from the americas , for example . 
  applying a tariff to uk goods entering the eu might make them uncompetitive relative to similar goods sourced inside the eu , however . 
   the eucu does n't preclude the uk from negotiating other agreements in the way eu membership does . 
  afaik , turkey has accepted limitations on its capacity to create external agreements as part of its membership of eucu . 
   i took issue with inextricably i think . . 
  it is n't inextricably linked if the uk can maintain membership outside of the eu . 
  the point being that if membership of the customs union happened at the same time and as a result of membership of the eec , then that is inextricable and will necessitate re-joining the customs union under different terms . 
   that 's largely because there are several approaches and it will depend on the negotiation . 
  okay , so the position is `` let 's vote in favour of this , and we 'll see what happens afterwards '' ? 
   what is turkey paying for access ? 
  good question . 
  i do n't know . 
   are there other export markets that will make up the rather large gap that the uk would leave ? 
  there does n't have to be because it 's not an all-or-nothing situation . 
  tariffs between the eu and uk based on wto levels would still make trade between the two entities efficient and competitive vis a vis the rest of the world . 
  nobody thinks that trade would cease entirely , but it may become 2 % to 3 % more expensive if the uk is outside the customs union . 
  have n't i read some arguments suggesting it may be in the uk 's interest to be outside the customs union anyway ? 
  someone in the leave campaign was saying recently that the uk post-brexit would be able to rapidly set up bilateral trade agreements with the us , with canada , and so on , without the bothersome eu bureaucracy slowing everything down . 
    if uk membership of eucu is inextricably linked to uk membership of eu  that assume that the uk ca n't sign up to the eucu outside of the eu , which is clearly false . 
  woah there , it looks like you 're deliberately taking my words out of context ? 
  i wrote :  if uk membership of eucu is inextricably linked to uk membership of eu , the uk would at least have to join eucu on a different basis after brexit . 
  which is clearly true . 
   do you really see the eu placing barriers between itself and the worlds 5th largest economy ? 
  i honestly do n't know , mostly because the leave campaign can not explain what will happen if brexit is voted . 
  if the uk wo n't contribute anything and expects to join the customs union , i 'd be surprised if the eu countries play ball . 
  certainly switzerland and norway will be rightfully indignant . 
  germany , italy , and france will look at their trade with the uk and decide whether they 'd prefer to give up some uk trade in favour of intra-eu trade . 
  that 's a complex analysis but off the top of my head there are few uk exports that could n't be sourced elsewhere inside the eu . 
   the eucu and eu membership are n't linked in the abstract sense , no , but in the uk 's case they are linked . 
   it seems incredibly unlikely that it 'd result in the uk outside of the customs union why so ? 
  if uk membership of eucu is inextricably linked to uk membership of eu , the uk would at least have to join eucu on a different basis after brexit . 
  if the uk is n't prepared to pay to be a member of the eea , the eu is likely to look for some other quid pro quo from the uk in return for access to the internal market , is n't it ? 
  if the uk wo n't cut a deal ( again john redwood 's position ) , why should the eu provide unrestricted access ? 
  why treat the uk better than norway or switzerland , for example ? 
  the customs union predates the eu certainly , but did the uk join prior to or separately from joining the then eec ? 
  i think that joining the eec brought the uk into the customs union , so membership of the latter was indeed predicated on membership of the former . 
  leaving the eu means all these agreements must be negotiated , at least from what i understand . 
  assuming the uk wo n't pay to be a member of the eea ( at least based on what john redwood has been saying ) , there 'll have to be a separate agreement worked out , wo n't there ? 
  here 's the point of the article : barcelona is ready to receive migrants but the eu interior ministers have not got their shit together to redistribute migrants . 
  it 's not a question of whether migrants `` like '' or `` dislike '' spain , or whether spain has better or worse benefits . 
  it 's a question of the migrants who have already arrived in greece and italy being redistributed among european countries , including spain . 
   also spain is featured in a small tv show ` game of thrones ' , as is ireland , fwiw . 
  threat ? 
  it 's not a threat for goodness sake . 
  it 's just a statement of what 's likely to develop based on what happens currently with airlines . 
  you guys are way too sensitive over this stuff . 
  yes , but it 's the french state rather than the french government . 
  but the point is that passport * checking * may be done by employees of the train company ; passport * control * is done by border police . 
  if the le touquet agreement is ended , passport * control * moves back to britain . 
   since when is the eucu predecated on eu membership ? 
  predicated ? 
  in the uk 's case , i think forever ? 
  or is there a separate agreement that wo n't need to be revisited in the case of brexit ? 
   of course . . and it 'll still be a matter for the french police after leaving the eu too . 
  not when someone successfully walks through the tunnel . 
  but this is getting silly . 
  it 's a shared security concern . 
   i doubt that you really do n't think the end of a customs union will have an impact on the speed at which goods move between britain and france ? 
  i would be astonished if it did n't . 
   religion ? 
  are you $ hiting me ? 
  no , they have applied for recognition as a religion in many countries . 
  and mostly this has been refused .

  if so , i 'll have to see the rest of your r\u00e9sum\u00e9 man . 
   i am just saying how i experience things are here at the office , the french are the ones people laugh the most at , always has been and forever will be . 
  oh god , that salt makes me feel so good . 
  wow . 
  i am bathing in it . 
   i did n't when france was attacked and i wont do it now either . 
  yes you are the bigger man indeed . 
  :d . with you , salt never tasted so sweet though . 
   do n't stop . 
  i 'm having fun . 
  tell me moar about the french . 
  it 's so gewd : s, 
  can you explain the joke ? 
  i do n't get it in the context of this story . 
   e form of news articles out there that show how belgians blame no one but themselves and how they 're calling for a change of the system . 
  how about charles michel saying yeah they were fearing a terrorist attack . 
  if they feared that why did n't they do squat ? 
  http://www.lemonde.fr/europe/article/2016/03/01/ce-que-savait-la-police-belge-sur-les-freres-abdeslam_4874375_3214.html listen what they said after the terrorist attack :  on a vraiment \u00e9t\u00e9 dans l\u2019amateurisme le plus total & nbsp ;  france , the french and its shitty non-reformist government will forever be the butt of most people 's jokes . 
  the salt . 
  man be careful , you 'll get hypertension from all that salt  . 
  i like it though . 
   having read your posts here lately , thank you . 
  it 's always nice to have a follower . 
   kicking belgium when it is down . 
  i kick the govt and police while telling the people they can get and deserve better . 
   he was n't the most wanted man in belgium ibrahim el bakraoui ** rented the apartment in forest used by abdeslam to hide in ** . 
  i read his name in the press friday a week ago . 
  before the terrorist attacks . 
   he was sent to the netherlands , walked out the airport in amsterdam and then disappeared in the most densely populated area of europe . 
  ah yes . 
  the guy was running free for months . 
  clearly nothing can be done . 
   the belgians made mistakes ** bullshit ** the belgian govt and police made mistakes . 
  that 's why 2 ministers sent their resignation letters . 
  it was a fuck up . 
  not all the belgians . 
  but again i see nuances are too complicated for you . 
  i do n't know about belgium but in france such a thing would be illegal and go against what makes france france . 
  we are a secular state and we 're proud to be that . 
  30 % are convinced atheists , 35 % are non-religious . 
  we wo n't start changing france because 1000 nutters . 
  ( also because it would n't work , the crazies will just say the imams are financed by kuffars and sionists so you ca n't trust them and with the internet they 'll have a free access to saudi arabian bs ), 
   no imaams who call for the destruction of europe or who vocally support antisemitism . 
  i really doubt these people became radicals by going to your regular vanilla mosque . 
  and the nutjobs will say these are imams sponsored by the kuffars and sionist , you can not trust them etc etc. 
  and with internet it 's easy to find a nutjob preacher that tells you the bs you wan na hear . 
   let 's bomb its capital it 's a hellhole anyway ' & nbsp ;  hyperbolic if you want to be consistent , apply the same logic to yourself . 
  i explained what he said and why . 
  stop freaking out , nobody really suggested it . 
  it was a hyperbolae , since you use the word so much . 
   and since not everybody will do this , image campaigns are sadly deemed necessary by the government ** since ** the campaign talks about the fact that there are no terrorists attacks in belgium , it should ** also ** mention the fact that they 're fearing terrorist attacks . 
  ever heard about lying by omission ? 
  belgium was in the 3rd state of alert out oof 4 for terrorist attacks . 
  ya know ... add a disclaimer ... if you wan na be factual . 
  or paint a rosy picture and reap the results . 
   so the attacks that happened on french soil by french citizens is also belgium 's fault ? 
  the abdeslam brothers never lived in france . 
  it seemed like a country wide thing though not one or two mosques . 
   bombing molenbeek bullshit calm yo tits . 
  it was just an extreme right commentator and he was obviously joking . 
  http://www.lemonde.fr/attaques-a-paris/article/2015/11/17/rtl-soutient-zemmour-qui-veut-bombarder-molenbeek_4812124_4809495.html he 's saying we 're doing war with saudi arabia which is just like isis . 
  he 's saying we 're quick to do war outside and ** ignore the problems at home . 
  ** which you are doing right now . 
   claiming it 's immoral to actually put up a campaign to correct this hyperbolic bullshit is plain stupid . 
  is it hyperbolic ? 
  really ? 
  belgium has the highest per capita rate of isis fighters in the western world . 
  is that a hyperbolae ? 
  or is it factual  to ignore that what 's happening in their countries and the involvement of their citizens ah yes . 
  we have a prime example right here . 
   batteling a battered reputation by avoiding the heavy issues . 
  seems plausible af well the campain was a lie . 
  ** your pm charles michel said he was fearing a terrorist attack , yet you guys released this bs campaign . 
  ** http://www.sudinfo.be/1519624/article/2016-03-22/charles-michel-nous-redoutions-un-attentat-et-c-est-arrive-il-y-a-de-nombreux-mo his words :  we were fearing a terrorism attack and it has happened . 
  there are many dead people . 
  ** why did they lie ** to people with such a false campaign ? 
  and i doubt your publicity stunt is that plausible now . 
  i do n't know how i 'll be able to sleep safely at night now . 
   just spend 5 minutes with your doc . 
  who 'll make sure you know the risks , the usage and check that you are healthy enough to take it . 
  he will also know which brand to prescribe in case you have health issues like allergies . 
  if it for women that use it  every monday after hooking up on weekends without thinking ahead . 
  like you say , why not simply have 1 meeting that tells her the risks and that 's it . 
  it 'll be good for all her lifetime does she need 5 minutes every week to meet the doctor ? 
  i 'm sure people remember these things after the 2nd or 3rd time . 
  one could also mention that in the belgian mosques they refused to hold a minute of silence or a prayer for the victims ( no prayer for the kuffars ) . 
  they condemned the attacks though . 
  sauce : https://www.reddit.com/r/france/comments/4bx3sf/dans_les_mosquees_pas_de_prieres_pour_les/ edit : the article mentions the council of theologians gave those recommendations to the mosques ( no prayers for non-believers and no minute of silence ) , i have no idea about the different islamic organisations in belgium . 
  / u/njuffstrunk said that the mosques did hold a minute of silence and of prayer for all the victims . 
  ** edit2 : ** the muslim executive of belgium said that they never held such comments and blame it on shoddy journalism . 
  http://www.embnet.be/default.aspx?base since le soir is a credible journal and they 've given their sources `` micha\u00ebl privot and radouane attiya '' , but the muslim organisations involved deny making such a decision . 
  well that 's about it , take things with a pinch of salt . 
  it is in poor taste to claim all is fine after the paris attacks were planned in molenbeek . 
  and one of the main people responsible were still on the run in bruxelles . 
  that 's from the moral side . 
  from the logical side : ** any ** marketting firm should know how to create campaigns that do n't backfire . 
  putting people that say :  so any guys with guns and bombs running about ? 
  is a ** baaaad ** idea . 
  because you can not guarantee the future . 
  you put soft stuff like hey look people hugging or couples walking hand in hand in grande place , you put scenery from the parks and talk about the fries .

   offering to legitimize their annexation of crimea why not though , * if the crimean people vote in favor of that * ? 
  just out of some primary anti-russian sentiment ? 
  because it seems to me that this is your only reason . 
  ( * edit * , sorry i had missed the last part of your post , and i thought i could answer fast enough but you had replied to me already   whatever `` fair '' referendum would be proposed would have it 's result predetermined well , that 's a kinda shitty thing to say , since if the result is predetermined it 's by definition not fair . 
  which is why the only means to make it fair is to organised it in a reasoned way , within the framework of an international conference and a fair control , instead of showing big guns and making the process biased both for and against russia , involving only actors with vested interests in the outcome . 
  so you 're basically saying a war against russia is the only possibility ? 
  to prevent crimeans from joining russia . 
  it looks like no one is pushing for that though , and i 'm clearly not in favor of it for my part . 
  but what matters in my post is n't whether m\u00e9lenchon is right or not . 
  i 'm explaining that * he says he is going to do something about it * unlike the post i was answering to said . 
   and yet he has repeatedly refused to do anything about it . 
  about what , though ? 
  if you 're thinking about the crimean situation , he has talked about organising an international conference with all the concerned countries . 
  he has also said several times that crimea is n't fundamentally more ukrainian than russian ( which is quite true from a historical point of view ) and that a fair self-determination referendum ( implying that the one that took place under russian control was not fair ) would be needed to decide on that . 
  that seems like * something * to me . 
  on the other hand , what we usually hear is that we have to take a tough stance against putin ( hamon even saying something akin to `` when you want to talk with putin , you better have big guns with you '' ) which , i 'm sorry , is really shortsighted because it does n't * resolve * anything , only drags on issues , delaying them and keeping the involved people in some kind of suspended state which benefits nobody . 
  honestly though , you do n't * have * to do it like this . 
  i 'm going to barge in with my french arrogance and superiority , but while most countries do keep their overseas territories under some shitty semi-autonomous status , i think the way we do it works well enough . 
  french guiana is a bit of an exception because it 's in a really bad place ( bad for industry , agriculture , tourism , infrastructure in general ) but the caribbean islands ? 
  people do complain about the expensiveness of some products , cost of life , etc , but they 're not corrupt , only have anecdotal independentist or autonomist movements , people do n't complain about colonialism and have about medium gdp compared to the mainland d\u00e9partements . 
  and people know about them , they 're not considered as unknown faraway places , most people have probably been or know friends or family who have been on vacation in martinique or guadeloupe ( or r\u00e9union , though it 's not in the caribbean ) . 
  i think it 's mostly down to political will and an attitude of inclusiveness from the people whether your overseas are shitty places abandoned to their own device or equal divisions within your country . 
   shifting the blame for pro-business policies on the european union pretty sure he does n't * shift * the blame on the eu , but distributes it between the eu and the french political class , with more weight on the french side of things , as he talks a lot about how hollande and his government often implement eu directives in a more economically liberal way than it was asked . 
  he mostly talks about the eu as an enhancer of the `` natural '' liberal tendencies of the french political class ( supposedly corrupted by its closeness with rich company owners ) when it should ( in his words ) instead protect the eu citizens against them ( hence the renegociating stuff ) . 
  i think you might only get in contact with the arguments that are the most against the eu because you 're outside of france and they are the only points that concern you and your media . 
   nobody eats nails in france ** s ** nails . 
  well , i do . 
  i also used to hunt them with my dad and my grandpa , then put them to fast and all that , before my mom could cook them . 
  i 'm not very fond of them though , it 's mostly for the associated memories . 
  it 's not an everyday dish , but it 's quite wrong to say that nobody eats snails in france . 
  stats say that 16 000 tonnes of snails are eaten ( or at least , sold ) in france per year , which is about 400 grams per adult per year . 
  discounting the many people who find them disgusting , that 's more than one plate per year . 
   what did he get wrong ? 
  smoking is forbidden in restaurants and people generally dislike accordion . 
  did you mean / s ? 
  the fn has had ties to nazi sympatizers since the day it was created . 
  i do n't think anyone will actually be surprised to hear that it is still the case . 
   there has been little to no pointed antagonism there 's the deliberate choice of an ambassador that has equated the eu with the ussr and implied he intended to break it up , for example . 
  if that does n't count as antagonism , i do n't know what does . 
  people from her party are usually the most adamant for using he masculine ( or neutral depending on your point of view ) version of titles . 
  so i think she might go for `` madame le pr\u00e9sident '' , if by chance she was elected ( which seems unlikely in any scenario for now ) . 
   i thought you spoke french because of the flair . 
  i do . 
  i 'm just saying this does n't explicitly mean leaving the eu or even the eurozone . 
  if i recall correctly , one of the early suggestions for plan b was to make the french central bank print euros disregarding cbe policies , thereby actively undermining the eurozone while staying inside it . 
  controling movement of goods between france and the rest of the eu is along the same lines , and does n't directly involve leaving the eu . 
  it 's rather sly , since the eu itself or its members do n't have the power to exclude another member ( as far as i remember ) , you can actually undermine it from the inside and i believe that 's what is outlined here rather than a straight exit . 
  it may even be possible to phagocytise it , so to say , by embarking other eu countries in this venture . 
  i 'm doubtful this would work , though . 
  he does n't have a constitutional right to leave the eu without a referendum or a 3/5 parliament vote . 
  by the way , your link does n't actually involve leaving the eu , it looks more like resisting from the interior . 
   a `` progressive '' taxation system does n't mean a system that has lots of narrow tax brackets . 
  please , i 'm not stupid . 
  a taxation system with more brackets is more progressive . 
  in any progressive system your average rate is of course below your top marginal rate , but within these , those with more and correctly spaced brackets are more progressive than the others . 
   he is obviously framing the 75 % rate as a punishment only because it 's so out of the line from the others , i think . 
  and i think he 's only mentioning the american high rate to show that this has already existed ( though we know that the 95 % bracket only applied to one person , so it 's kinda pointless in our context ) . 
   not necessarily a referendum , melenchon can pull out without referendum if `` negociations will fail '' modifying the constitution ( which says `` france is part of the eu '' ) needs a 3/5 majority from the parliament , or a simply majority at a referendum . 
  so i do n't think anyone can just pull out if they want to . 
  good , let 's go into the details then . 
   un syst\u00e8me d'imp\u00f4t o\u00f9 on passait de 45 % \u00e0 75 %  * a taxation system where one goes from 45 % to 75 % * so he is against * such a large step * , not the rate at the highest bracket . 
  his current programme talks about going from 5 different brackets to 14 different brackets , which would effectively make it more progressive and avoid such a large step . 
  which seems consistent with what he said . 
   he has been a eurosceptic his entire political life . 
  like when he voted for maastricht ? 
  no , it was absurd because it was n't a supplementary tax bracket but a completely separate tax kicking in at an arbitrary level , and therefore having an important threshold effect ( with people earning more potentially ending up with less money ) . 
  and for no obvious reason . 
  his proposal is simply integrated into the current income tax scheme , which seems like an obvious way to do it . 
  wait , wait , did you actually read what he says in your link ? 
   * this tax is n't very intelligent - because it 's a tax [ implying , a separate tax , rather than something integrated into income tax ] - it should be a supplementary level in income tax * and his current programme is ... wait for it ... adding a level to income tax . 
  yeah . 
  that 's what he said in 2013 . 
  just to be clear , he was an investigation on those who are responsible for * allowing * the purchase . 
  so , french politicians . 
  to determine if they had interests in this or if they were independent and honest in their decision . 
  he 's also not talking about jail ( obviously ) . 
   full blown communist but communism means abolishing private property . 
  especially * full blown * communism . 
  i know m\u00e9lenchon is radically more socialist than the other big candidates , but it does n't mean people should muddy up everything by calling him communist when his programme and his speeches do not correspond to any communist ideal . 
  high income taxes is by definition not communist , since it means people can have high incomes . 
  if anything , you could call him a socialist with some communist leanings , i guess ? 
  that 's far from being a full blown communist . 
   about the changes to the constitution , i heard that macron also wants to change the system . 
  is that true ? 
  nope , macron has never been in favor of a constitutional change . 
  he talks a lot about `` changing the system '' ( as do all of them , even fillon ) but his actual propositions do not change the current organisation of the republic . 
  i 'm of course a bit biased , but i 'm pretty sure he represents a kind of continuity , moving towards the center , after hollande . 
   is any other candidate willing to change france to a parliamentary system ? 
  it 's part of hamon 's programme ( and montebourg which was hamon 's opponent during the primary ) . 
  i think they are the only two presidential candidates in favour of that . 
   this kind of politics does n't work and has always failed for france . 
  it 's a weird comment , because france has never done this kind of politics within the eu . 
   and how is his russia stance ? 
  just to be factual and downplay a little bit the `` putin is m\u00e9lenchon 's idol '' we usually hear on this topic , what he actually said about putin :  je combats absolument sa politique et si j' \u00e9tais russe , je ne voterais pas pour son parti mais pour mon camarade du front de gauche russe , qui est en prison something along the lines of :  i am absolutely opposed to his policies and if i were russian , i would n't vote for his party but for my russian left wing comrade , who is in prison however , he thinks that taking a strong military stance against russia wo n't help on anything but make russia take a stronger stance in turn , and that in the end the only way to get out of this spiral is to conduct talks among all the concerned actors and countries in the area . 
  well , maybe the words in english are a bit different , but `` national-lib\u00e9ralisme '' is what we use in france to designate that . 
  not sure about which word order should be used in english . 
  oh of course i know there are other organisations , and maybe there are better options besides alba , i 'm not an expert on south america . 
  aladi/laia though is also a common-market , free-trade oriented association , so not really applicable here because there 's already the eu . 
  france is already an observer in the ibero-american summit . 
  it 's intended for former spanish and portuguese territories , so france 's observer status actually comes from roussillon , franche-comt\u00e9 and flanders being former spanish territories ( which is also the reason for belgium and the netherlands having that status ) .

  the day uber raises prices , people will pick up their own car and start doing their own independent uber . 
  see , unlike facebook that has a network that you can not replicate , amazon that has warehouse that you can not replicate , uber has ** nothing ** but an app . 
   uber runs a 2 billion deficit with a 10 billion revenue ( in 2015 ) and stays afloat purely on venture capital . 
  perfect . 
  free money for us . 
  let us take advantage of it . 
    after all , the vc gangs that financed billions of operational losses will want their money back . 
  perfect . 
  we agree . 
  the worst thing you can do to uber is actually use uber . 
   when children in the west die then there 's `` respect for victims '' and other lies . 
  would the parents agree with having the media plaster images of their children run over , mangled etc ? 
  would n't it be more beneficial to have the media show images of their kids when they were alive , happy etc ? 
   do you have a problem with the french people deciding its future ? 
  if we 're to decide our own future we should have a referendum on the death penalty too . 
   i do n't think that 's their only reason to cancel the visit goddamit . 
  why did n't bojo consult with / u/patnau before changing schedules . 
   at the moment every ride is subsidised by uber ( ~ 40 % !!! ) . 
  all that sweet venture capital money so we agree . 
  a very basic microeconomic analysis shows that yeah you 'd be stupid not to pocket those 20 euros . 
  i perform an arbitrage . 
   the more uber i consume , the less money uber will have . 
  and france and germany are making money off the greek debt . 
  hurray !, 
  reddit is full of her fanboys . 
  a 6km taxi ride costs me 33 euros by tax , 13 euros by uber . 
  if wanting to keep 20 euros makes me an ayn rand fanboy then that means i can use that money to buy a kindle version of atlas shrugged and still have enough left for an espresso . 
   let 's stop asking taxi drivers to get licensed , and stop asking the cars to have a medallion . 
  if you suddenly say that taxis no longer will need medallions , you know who 'll riot ? 
  taxi drivers . 
  the state basically gives the medallions for free but they are n't a ton of them . 
  medallions allow you to pick up people that flag you or allow you to stay at airports or stations . 
  it 's the black market taxi drivers buying and selling medallions that made the price super high : 400k in some parts of france for example . 
  if the state tells them no medallions will be necessary these people will start rioting . 
   i can confirm that they are in romania . 
  they are subhumans who assault and insult people , take the scenic routes oh man i 've got a story about that . 
  i was in bucharest and got in a cab . 
  i was tired from my flight and stuff and only after a few km did i notice that he did n't turn on any taximeter . 
  so i start complaining , dude this is bullshit , why did n't you turn it on ? 
  how much will this cost me and he gives me some bullshit amount and i start getting annoyed . 
  and that 's when he tells me : `` are you annoyed because i 'm gypsy ? '', 
  `` no dude , i 'm annoyed because you 're ripping me off '' . 
  dickhead trying to play the race card . 
  f\u00e9nelon . 
   i 'm stunned you made that statement . 
  i 'm now imagining someone gasp in shock at their screen , paralised for an instant then slaming their laptop closed . 
  after pacing nervously through the room for 5 minutes , typing while shaking `` how could you say uber drivers are former taxi drivers ? '', 
  you keep insulting . 
  i 'll keep reporting . 
  you should stay off the internet if you ca n't control your temper , 
  condescending behaviour and cheap attacks are against reddiquette . 
  you should bother getting a proper education then and revise your behaviour . 
  you 're bringing `` civilised behaviour '' in a discussion about lawful actions . 
  i fail to see how it is relevant to the discussion . 
  what 's civilised is to respect the rule of law , by regular people , heads of state or prosecutors . 
  end of discussion . 
   in the cases it would be possible we often do not do it , because we choose to get along with each other in a more civilized way . 
  prosecuting those that commit crimes is not civilised . 
  interesting view on it . 
   they would need to actually violate the law in a given country , and you would still rely on the hungarian government actually extraditing him/her . 
  since hungary is surrounded by the eu except through serbia , that would essentially mean that those people targeted are basically stranded . 
   regardless this is not something for others to be involved in and would set a really bad precedent , we do n't prosecute fillon or sarkozy either even though they 're criminals . 
  so we agree . 
  it 's not a matter of being possible but of matter of wanting to actually do it . 
  it 's sufficient to prosecute those around orban . 
  state corruption like this is n't just orban and the govt . 
  heck probably he 's smart enough to not come close to this and just have henchmen do the dirty work . 
   eu member funds where do eu member funds come from ? 
  also some countries take more than they give . 
  hungary is one of them , 
  why do n't you go back to t_d ? 
   you can prosecute hungarian criminals in different jurisdictions if they commit crimes in different jurisdictions , like you always can , but that 's not what you said . 
  maybe eu funds used the euro . 
  and as such extend the jurisdiction similar to what the us does . 
   those are two different promises , no point in arguing over it so he promised to leave the eu unless he gets everything he wants . 
  we 're back at the beginning . 
  awesome ! . 
  he promised a credit ref if he does n't get everything he asked for . 
  it 's not complicated man . 
   that 's the position he takes for his electorate but i do n't think he 's actually going to push to leave the eu vote for m\u00e9lenchon . 
  he wo n't do what he promised to do !, 
   melenchon is just sceptic of the liberal eu , not really eurosceptic i did n't see any other projects for the eu . 
  his strategy is : give us everything i want or we 'll leave . 
  not exactly how one negociates for a europe with vastly different sensibilities , is it ? 
  i see melenchon complaining about how factories are moving in eastern europe but i see him offering no projects that would raise the standard of living there . 
  eh , i can make popcorn comments and still be fine :p, 
   not supporting strikes is not the same thing as supporting assad using chemical weapons . 
  i hear no alternatives . 
   it 's like watching jacob rees-mogg discover reddit . 
  / u/finndacool gives / u/trucidator the most epic putdowns . 
   thing in question is a speeding ticket that you are currently fighting casier judiciaire should be only for penal condamnations . 
  at least that 's the case for france . 
   he leaves that to the french people to decide via the referendum , that 's in the video you posted . 
  how will he campaign ? 
  i have ** no ** idea what he 'll campaign . 
  he 'd be the president . 
  how will he lean ? 
   a referendum on whether he should accept the results of the negotiations or not , to be clear to anyone reading us , not on france 's membership . 
  a referendum on accepting the results that will result in a ** no ** will mean a frexit referendum and from the momentum of the first vote will mean a ** yes ** on frexit . 
  c'mon man , we 're not stupid .

  actually a part do because of what we 're talking about . 
  next one to fall is petry . 
  and i 'm confident about the german people . 
  yep it 's real .

   dick eaters mangeurs de bite . 
  russia is a threat to france ? 
  fucking lol mate . 
  yeah . 
  but most of the non-french that use it , really think that french people laugh this way . 
  hate/mock them . 
  that does n't make him a perv . 
  who cares his wife is older than him ? 
  if that 's your best argument to convince people to vote le pen you guys are pathetic . 
  why is he a perv ? 
  en avant p\u00c9d\u00c9 !,

  i was sarcastic . 
  oh god the uk really is an islamic country !, 
  fox news was right all along !, 
  why are n't you visiting ? 
  it 's an incredible opportunity to burn the eu parliament to the ground . 
  i 'm guessing the powers of a french president under the fifth french republic . 
   i 'm literally paraphrasing yanks on twitter you 're kidding right ? 
  nobody is that stupid . 
  and i 'd love to storm the elys\u00e9e . 
   queen le pen you really know how to make french people hate a politician , do n't you ? 
  but you 're right , she 's much more of a heir than macron is . 
  was n't there a bet , that some user would ( litterally ) eat a dick if le pen wins ? 
  oh trust me there are obese people in france , but the problem is not nearly as bad as the uk or the us . 
  thd french polls were absolutely on point for the first round . 
  you should be proud . 
  you created the cuntiest cunt that ever cunted !, 
  well you certainly are . 
  king george is dead since a looong time . 
  he ca n't command anything now . 
  there is no animosity between ireland and england , and there have never been any . 
  right ? 
  you really prefer m\u00e9lenchon over le pen or is it just because you wan na see the eu burn ? 
  hah we got our first pandas in 1973 , and then china gave us two pandas again in 2012 . 
  panda gift is the most wholesome international gift ever . 
  why ? 
  why ? 
  this is heresy !, 
  shamefur disprray !, 
   multiple sensible mandates resolve the problems that makes people vote fn . 
  also why no :  ? 
  stopping the national front is out of macron 's league ... it will take multiple sensible mandates to `` cure '' france .

  of course i 'm not a monarchist . 
  but the question was about you : are you a monarchist or not ? 
  you 're a monarchist ? 
  must be because of the unbiased russian media . 
  absolutely the french youth wants change . 
  and that 's why most of them voted for m\u00e9lenchon . 
  why should it ? 
  coontown , fatpeoplehate , beatingwomen , alt-right/pussypass , fullcommunism , thefarleftside , anarchism , anarcho-capitalism ... yep , plenty of extremists on reddit .

  when i think of all the things a united france and germany could have accomplished .

  da wurst kraut plot since da blitz, 
  behold the the laundry detergent of the gods !,

  because at the end of the day that 's what they 're actually concerned with - how sick and tired westerners respond to this . 
  not the loss of human life , not the risk of severe negative consequences for society in its entirety , just the fact that thousands of miles away there 's going to be some mountain dew-drinking random us teenager who 'll vent his frustration on a keyboard . 
  how 's that for losing touch with reality ? 
  you can see how increasingly desperately they 're trying to somehow pin at least some blame on anyone who 's preferably white and certainly not muslim . 
  when cognitive dissonance becomes severe enough , this is all that 's left for you to do . 
  hence the fact there 's even a `` please not be muslim '' meme for these scenarios . 
   everyone usually comes out unhappy which seems to be a good indication of fairness very solid point  . 
  thanks for the info . 
   i 've also been shocked at how much it has helped in the informal social world at work where 100 % of the people in my department are either married or divorced . 
  interesting , i had no idea . 
  a bit of an unrelated question really , but are divorce courts fair in spain ( assuming that is the jurisdiction of your marriage ) ? 
  someone else on this thread mentioned portugal as a place where they sure seem to be . 
   ( cheating is most common cause for divorce ) if you say so . 
  but are more than half of divorces caused by cheating ? 
  i 'm asking because if there are many causes invoked then even the most common one could stand at 15 % or something . 
  the overwhelming majority of divorces are female initiated and i believe that no specific reason is brought up before the divorce court in most cases , at least where i 'm from . 
  anecdotally , i have seen my father getting divorced because my mother wanted to consort with a much lesser man instead , many of my friends back then were in a situation that looked a lot like it too . 
  so yeah , that 's a hard pill to swallow . 
  no amount of shaming about how men are supposedly these sex-crazed cheaters is going to ever change that . 
   but at the end of the day it 's a legal contract that is important i agree fully with that part , and it 's precisely the reason why i 'm very wary of arguments in favor of marriage that are emotional in nature - which are by far the most common when nationality is not a factor . 
  i 've signed a number of contracts , but even with the ones signed between blood relatives all parties made it a point that they are legally binding and as such require proper reflexion , not '' * omg , if you 're in love you do n't think about these things lol * '' . 
  for better or worse , you guys are uniquely good at displaying your history and culture to the entire world . 
  sun tzu remarked that if you do n't leave an escape route to a cornered enemy , they 'll fight to the bitter end . 
  that was dozens of centuries ago . 
  judging by how much they like to broadcast their execution vids , we can roughly guess how many soldiers recently let themselves be captured by isis . 
  what we 'll most likely never know however , is how much damage was inflicted on isis by surrounded troops that had no choice but to fight with everything they 've got . 
  in several cases , regime army garrisons have succesfully held up to 3 year long sieges . 
  being all stick and no carrot is a double edged sword . 
  it may not be what you 're asking for , but there 's this interesting side effect i have witnessed : many ordinary people seem to have processed the experience , fully acknowledged the inevitability of random attacks , then grew a thicker skin and decided they 're just going to live with it . 
  just like people in many other parts of the world have to . 
  human beings in general are great at adapting to all sorts of circumstances , but the day you have to lower the bar so much that you 'll accept this as a new aspect of big city life is a sad one . 
  no it should n't . 
  i said chav but i 'm not sure that was the best word to describe exactly the same profile that i 'm sure both us are having in mind right now . 
   he kept germany out of libya while every other nato nation was rushing to join in the melee that 's no small achievement . 
  intervening in libya was such a fuckup . 
  props to him , too bad that his passing is the first time i 've heard of him . 
  exactly . 
  there seems to be serious class-based differences regarding holiday destinations in the uk . 
  the kind , patient and polite ( to a fault , actually ) british folks i deal with as part of my job in the french countryside have nothing in common with some chav getting into a drunken argument with a prostitute in phuket or wherever . 
   he did n't talk much about it , and when he did , he expressed support for it . 
  i 'd like to see a source for that . 
  an article i read the other day specifically mentioned that he did not say anything * at all * on the record before the iraq war before it happened . 
  it 's not like societies have been dealing with this for centuries and we already know the outcome for sure . 
  we ca n't be certain of what happens next if/when few workers will have to support an elderly population , and when retirement schemes become unsustainable . 
  talking about harry potter , severus snape becomes * severus rogue * in the french translation . 
  which would have been fine for clarification purposes , except for the fact that * rogue * is a rare archaic french word , meaning `` arrogant '' , that few french speakers understand . 
  as a kid i just assumed for the longest time that `` rogue '' in harry potter was an allusion to the sort of heroic fantasy thief that i had grown used to thanks to videogames . 
  turns out those two words are unrelated and do n't even share the same roots . 
  some translators overdo it . 
  translating proper nouns in a way that somehow turns them into something more complicated * even * for the audiences you 're translating for is something that pisses me off more than it should . 
  absolutely . 
  the british tourists i interact with as part of my job in touristy areas of rural france are the most patient , agreeable and polite folks i deal with . 
  essentially they 're just not the same sort of people that you 'd meet in ibiza , amsterdam or in thailand . 
   too little instinct to cooperate . 
  sometimes it 's just not necessarily in the best interests of european countries to cooperate with one another . 
  to take just one example , france has a rational interest in getting closer with russia to fight against isis . 
  as a french national , i 'm more than okay with this . 
  but let 's be honest if i were a finn or from a baltic state i would be pretty pissed off at a major european country for developing closer ties with russia . 
  as i phrased it , it is absolute hogwash . 
  it implies a strong form of causation which is easily disproved . 
  but yes , a more nuanced argument making the case that a large pool of alienated youth makes extremists ' job to recruit far easier than it otherwise would be is n't `` absolutely '' wrong . 
  in any case and considering what it at stake every time we reinforce the idea that terrorism is somehow an understandable form of discontent ( making * their * jobs easier ) , i 'd rather go for hyperbole and use `` absolutely '' in a debatable way instead of joining that crowd . 
  and this is precisely why the * terrorism happens because there are underprivileged youth facing racism in western countries * narrative , which is taken as gospel by many , is absolute hogwash . 
  even after looking up wikipedia for its `` 1977 in america '' entry , i honestly do n't know which event you 're referring to . 
  lola sounds like she had lot of good friends , i know of at least another redditor who knew her too . 
  i 'm sorry for your loss . 
  i do n't know how to contact david bowie . 
  but if someone manages to catch his attention and start some kind of initiative that needs online attention , i would be happy to help . 
  keep on rocking in the free world . 
  i 'm not , because i 'm pretty sure that when it comes to social issues there are n't * that * many differences between what the left can and ca n't do to address them . 
  on either side of the atlantic . 
  one of the main differences is that it 's much easier to quantify racial issues in america ( from who commits crime to who suffers from discrimination to who faces biases in some areas , etc. ), 
  than it is in most places in europe , so i 'm going with american examples instead . 
  here in france we might have been buried our heads so deeply in the sand that we ca n't even find relevant statistics when needed if only in order to check the scope of those issues , but most people on either end of the political spectrum seem to agree that our integration of minorities is far from satisfying . 
  significant achievements have been made regarding gay rights and women rights/integration in the workplace , no doubt about it . 
  western societies went from socially acceptable homophobic police raids to widely supported gay marriages , all in a matter of decades . 
  have they actually done anything of the sort against racism and to improve the integration of ethnic minorities , though ? 
  public expressions of blatant racism have largely become unacceptable and grossly racist laws in the us south have been repealed since . 
  but considering how prevalent anti-racist narratives have been on a daily basis for the last 40-to-50 years , this is surprisingly little to show for it . 
  in some respects , african americans somehow fare worse than they did decades ago ( e.g. 
  incarceration rates , and a great decline in family structure which of course is overlooked by progressives but arguably more important than many other factors ) . 
  hard to say . 
  this is entirely anecdotal , but i used to work in the `` gay village '' in paris ( le marais ) and i befriended local cops . 
  one night they were tipsy and they kept telling me the only real problem they have in their part of the city is when `` youths '' come down from the suburbs to beat up and mug local gay men . 
  breivik was one lone nutter . 
  norway adopted the proper reaction considering the circumstances , but it 's at least in part because they could * afford to * . 
  islamic terrorism is a whole other beast . 
  isis is a whole other beast - it 's an entity acting effectively a state which officially sponsors terrorist attacks . 
  and unfortunately , in my country at the moment there are far more than just one person ( like breivik ) who would very much like to gun down , bomb and stab innocent civilians . 
  paranoia or not , people are absolutely right to suspect that we have n't yet seen an end to these senseless aggressions . 
  thank for you for sharing your perspective , i did not know that . 
  i 'm not sure i agree with your first post ( mocking their humanity ) , but i see where you 're coming with this one . 
  you 're right that the cover this week feels hopeful and inspirational albeit in its own slightly twisted way , whereas in comparison other covers about other victims were just grim and very dark , if not mean-spirited . 
  so yeah basically i agree , if they 're going to mock some victims then they should mock all victims . 
  you 're absolutely right , i 've been pointing out myself in another comment that even something you never think of such as carbon monoxide poisoning is a far bigger killer than terrorism in france . 
  but human nature being what it is , people are absolutely gon na react by being paranoid . 
  if what happened in paris starts happening fairly regularly ( more so than it has so far ) , daily life is bound to be seriously disrupted no matter what you and i think of it . 
  i 'm afraid you read me wrong . 
  isis absolutely ** needs ** to get taken down and * anyone * standing by their side should be on the receiving end of a drone or a navy seals raid . 
  if my comment history is of any indication , i 've been saying that over and over for the last 18 months .

  maybe it 's because i 'm from the south of france , but i really feel that italy is more like a brother country that share a lot with us . 
  the architecture , the vestige , the food ( olive oil and tomatoes everywhere ) , the colors , the weather , mediterranean sea ... we share so many things that you 're more an ally and a friend against nordic countries . 
  i suppose that my view could not be shared by everybody , people from alsace should feel closer to germans , bretons/normans should feel closer to british , and so on with other parts of france with spain and belgium . 
  that might be why france does n't have a clear rival , we have so many influential neighbours that there is no clear consensus , and we rather tend to feel closer to our closest regional neighbourg compared to the rest of france . 
  it seems that every single european country think they have a rivalry with france . 
  even for the famous uk/france rivalry , french actually do n't give a shit , it 's more a british circlejerk . 
  i love this vestager . 
  we need more people like her in the eu . 
   a lot of it is pretty and some of its cheese is nearly as good as english stuff . 
  happy to see that even merkel + obama ca n't impose everything to the eu . 
  and you think that the weapon deals of france are not fucking important for eu ? 
  if france does n't keep its military status ( not so big compared to the other behemoth , but not ridiculous ) , eu is nothing and you know it . 
  what 's good for france is good for europe . 
  give a single example where it would not be the case ? 
  i did n't say that that it was not a big challenge , but the challenge is clear : if eu politicians do n't provide enought effort to fuck uk hard , this is the end of the eu . 
  you 're lucky , eu politicians can be extremely stupid and suicidal , so they can fail , but do n't expect a complete passivity . 
  the only sane answer is `` does n't make much difference '' . 
  happy to see that france has the highest percentage for this answer . 
  the eu has the ability to do that , but will probably not do it . 
  imagine economic sanctions comparable to the russian one ? 
   i love how the eu is apparently this amazing marvel of a thing , but the idea of giving us a mutually beneficial deal is allegedly enough to kill it . 
  there is no possible mutually beneficial deal . 
  it 's crystal clear : if uk doest n't suffer hard , eu is finished . 
  even a pro-eu like me will not believe in eu anymore if your country is not out of the top 10 world economy in the next decade . 
  not sure if sarcastic , but i think it 's quite different . 
  i read that she showed her ass . 
  do n't care , i just feel that banning a simple clothing is way too much . 
  even the simple clothing that i do n't like and that conveys a retarded ideology . 
  i propose to not ban it but let people be opposed . 
  i 'm opposed to people that swear in front of my kids , but i would not support sanctions against people that swears in the street in front of my kids . 
   another point , i ca n't access to the article , but i am wondering even how true this poll thing is ... 
  the poll is true but the result is completely exploited . 
  this is the exact study ( in french ) : http://www.ifop.com/media/poll/3460-1-study_file.pdf the exact question was :  le burkini est un v\u00eatement de bain pour femme couvrant le torse , ainsi qu\u2019une partie des membres et de la t\u00eate . 
  in english ( the best i can , sorry if it 's not exact , other francophone might correct ) : the burkini is a clothing for women that covers the torso and a portion of the legs/arms and head . 
  are you positive , opposed or indifferent to the burkini use on beaches ? 
  with this formulation , it 's difficult to answer that you 're `` positive '' or `` indifferent '' to something so rare and unusual . 
  i 've never seen something like that before ( which is the case of the large majority of frenchmen ) , of course i might be shocked/annoyed if i see that everywhere . 
  but it 's not the case , and the question is not about a ban at all . 
  the use of this poll by journalists and politics is completely misleading , it 's perfectly sane to not be `` positive '' or `` indifferent '' to this kind of thing ( particularly given the context ) , but it does n't mean that a ban is supported . 
  i said that i was against the ban . 
  is n't it crystal clear ? 
  you do n't read french and did n't understand the exact terms of the questions and the answers . 
  i 'm opposing the eating of meat but i would hate a ban of meat ... is that so difficult to understand ? 
  the title of this post is misleading , the real poll states that a majority of french are opposed to the burkini , not that they support the ban . 
  i 'm personally against the burkini ( i do n't like bigots ) and against the ban ( i support free will , even for dumb bigots ) . 
   no , you 're thinking of the uci ( union cycliste internationale ) and the tour de france ... oh they 're both run by the french , right ? 
  it 's precisely because they 're both run by the french that we know about a large amount of doping cases . 
  doping . 
  the number of downvotes for your comment confirm your statement : people are stupid ( even on reddit ) . 
  thanks dope . 
  thanks dope and cycling . 
  it 's the same in every civilized country . 
   95 % of the natives died of smallpox the spanish brought . 
  hence why we were able to settle easily . 
  had we tried it 200 years earlier , we 'd be facing millions upon millions of native americans . 
  there are evidences that brit brougth voluntarily smallpox to some amrindian tribes : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/siege_of_fort_pitt . 
  please , do n't deny the crimes of british colonisation , it 's one of the most violent and ruthless colonisation style . 
   australians were still aussies when they discriminated aboriginals . 
  the queen of the aussies is still the queen of england . 
   we did n't exterminate them all . 
  95 % of native americans were dead when the french and english touched north american soil . 
   do n't forget , you held land in n.america amerindians formed a big alliance with the french against the english during the 7 years war . 
  they were exterminated after the loss of the french . 
   in africa , we did n't exterminate them not completely , but the appartheid and the number of whites that you brougth is without comparison with what france did in africa . 
   in fact the only ones you might have a point about is australia , but even then the aussies did most of that themselves . 
  aussies = brit at this time . 
  this is still nearly the case ... 
  romania is a permanent member of the oif ( organisation internationale de la francophonie ) . 
  it 's false , actually the pronunciation is more consistent in german than in spanish . 
  and ? 
  it 's normal . 
  well , the only difference with french colonies is that you exterminated the natives to put people of european descent with your language , your culture , your values and your system . 
  i think i 'm more proud to have only ex-colonies with most of the population that is still native . 
  yeah , but as i told you , french-bashing is not only used by the british press or the americans , it 's also used a lot by the french elite themselves . 
  example in the article :  `` i do n't think the french are lazy , '' air france-klm alexandre de juniac said . 
  `` but are we clever ? 
  the problem is that sometimes the french think they are cleverer than others . 
  it 's a very serious mistake -- it 's arrogant . '' it 's the perfect illustration of what i explained . 
  alexandre de juniac is the boss of air france klm , a low-cost company of air france that had a lot of problems with strikes because of the conditions of the workers . 
  this guy for sure hates that french spirit and would like workers that just shut up , and what is he saying ? 
  that french are arrogants because they think they 're cleverer , a typical stereotype coming from the brits that think that just speaking french is being an arrogant aristocrat ( this is just historical , because french vocabulary was used a lot by the english aristocracy since the middle-age ) . 
  saying that the frenchmen are arrogant is complete bullshit and non-sense , you can be sure that alexandre de juniac knows it and does n't think it , but he just reuses the obsession of anglophone to confirm their stereotypical views and convince the rest of the world that he 's right . 
  this is typical of the big ceos in france , saying in france `` look at the other countries , they 're mocking us '' and saying to the others `` as you know it , frenchmen are arrogant and/or lazy , mock them '' . 
  the thing is that french are very receptive to criticisms . 
  being critical is in our nature , we constantly question our own rules , we debate and we think a lot ( maybe too much ) about it . 
  so when an influent neighbour question our system , we 're receptive . 
  the fact that powerful , influent and rich people would prefer a more liberal and less egalitarian system ( like in germany and in the uk ) does n't help , because they constantly criticize france in this regards . 
  we have tons of famous athlete , television presenter , singer or actor that leave france because they 're not happy with taxes and that explains that taxes is what ruin our country . 
  obviously , this is not true , but when all the anglosphere and the french elite attack the concept of the french economy , there are consequences on the opinion . 
  we 're just demanding for everything , that 's why we have one of the best social system in europe but are continuously on strike . 
  well , french-bashing by the english press does n't help , and we also have continuously liberals that tell to everybody on tv how fucked up is the french economy and how close to the english or german system we should be ( regarding taxes , work laws ... ) . 
  the result is an economy that is on par with the uk , but a perception of it that is lower . 
   can you - if you would - spell out why it is a problem to use the language of another super-power ? 
  apart from our lost pride of course . 
  because an influent country has even more influence when others play with their rules , with their language . 
  i gave you a simple example with science . 
  the uk and the usa outrageously dominate this field because everything is centered on their language . 
  scientists have to publish in their journals , have to pay their publishing groups , are judged with their metrics that are centered around their view in their academic system . 
  imagine , if tomorrow the usa and malaysia are at war , who will you support ? 
  i guess usa , because you partially share their language , their views , their culture .

well in france we currently have 3 great choices :d incompetent government led by `` bling politicians '' , islamic fascism , or going back to 19th century clerical-france with the front national . 
  interesting insight . 
  thank you . 
  wilders represents the netherlands , which has a completely different situation when it comes to muslim immigration there , which is much more massive than in austria , and of different origin . 
  i looked into the politics of austria and the situation seems to be very different there . 
  ever since the austro-hungarian empire , there has been some kind of a tolerance for islam and the religious problem was never really there since the empire allowed multiculturalism & multi-religion . 
  so the fpoe i think does not have anywhere near the same line on islam as the pvv . 
  but again i think it comes down to national differences between the netherlands & austria . 
  they also differ with the fpoe in a number of ways . 
  this is the thing with right wing politics : there doesnt seem to be uniformity and it differs according to country . 
  it seems to be fpoe is content with preserving austria as some kind of switzerland clone . 
  what 's interesting is that the population doesnt seem to have massively increased in germany . 
  no town seems to be a hotspot there . 
  that said , 2011 is quite dated . 
  hahaha good one mate . 
  austria does n't want anything to do with berlin nazis . 
  vote npd , that is a more sensible option than bothering austrians . 
  `` far right '' seems to be evolving as a definition in austria these days . 
  1 year ago most of the austrian government 's current actions would be considered far right , but now they are normal . 
  i 'm still astonished by the turnaround even on here , with most left-inclined austrians now justifying their government 's actions on most things . 
  as you normally would any poll ... 
  they probably did make the same choice in the previous election but there were problems with the vote counting . 
  no ignorance here since you are perfectly right . 
  the austrian presidency is meaningless . 
  the impact would be for propaganda/mediatic purposes only , with an `` austrian far right president '' making waves on international headlines . 
  however personally i think austrian politics have become inherently right wing ever since the migrant crisis happened , and i am talking about people outside the fpoe . 
  its a true fallacy to think far right/austrian patriots reside only in the fpoe . 
  austrian 's foreign minister is categorized by me as far right ( sebastian kurz ) . 
  christian kern himself ( chancellor ) i believe is pandering enormously to the nationalistic right and could be a crypto-nationalist . 
  hofer is barely far right in my books . 
  his agenda is capitalistic and liberal . 
  he reminds me more of a national-conservative bourgeois type right winger , appealing to the class of austrians who want to maintain their priviledges . 
  most real national-socialists on the internet disavow the fpoe and hofer . 
  he is in the same league as wilders ' pvv in netherlands . 
  austrians dislike being run by germany , always did . 
  the illusion of a harmonious anschluss was propagated by the nazis and adolf hitler , but in no way did this show the truth . 
  the truth was shown in 1945 . 
  when the soviets invaded vienna , an underground austrian government , headed by karl renner , had already made full proposal to the russians for a plan to secede austria from germany and re-establish austrian independence . 
  this is why germany was occupied and only reunified in 1990 , whilst the austrians quickly seceded and got their own state already in 1955 . 
  this would have been impossible without massive austrian desire to separate from germany . 
  only adolf hitler had the fantasy of joining with the germans . 
  this is because hitler was an austrian living on the border towns with germany with strong german history , which had a strong german nationalist movement/ideology . 
  this is not representative of most of austria/austrians , who feel an intense difference with germans . 
  hitler in effect betrayed all of austria by annexing it illegally to the german reich . 
  hitler was much more german than austrian at the end of the day . 
  i disagree . 
  the current `` democratic systems '' in the west right now are just corrupt crony-capitalists systems run by elites which are extremely detached from the people . 
  if you actually let people run the show , politics would look very different today , probably much more on the right . 
  sarkozy is a nato shill . 
  just like your entire puppet government in your country . 
  he did in the last election he was involved in to steal all fn votes . 
  100 % correct . 
  nothing to add . 
  stop killing kurds though bro . 
  stupid french will again elect this idiot instead of the only party which will actually implement what he says ( fn ) . 
  keep in mind sarkozy is a president that was a disaster during his 5 years tenure , and reneged on all his promises regarding immigration , security , etc. 
  he even involved france in afghanistan , lybia , etc. . . which were disastrous operations which affected europe badly . 
  munich and surroundings mainly . 
  obviously as soon as you go into the smaller villages , they are not to be seen . 
  saw them mostly at supermarkets , in parks , downtown , etc. 
  burqa/nikabs are intimidating and scary , whilst a simple veil is acceptable . 
  when you see the former , you are shocked as you witness the deepest part of arabia , afghanistan , or bedouin desert culture in the midst of the secular west , where women are dressing with more and more freedom . 
  it is shocking and you feel like a wedge has been placed between you and `` them '' as foreign culture . 
  its a clear message to european men by muslim men saying `` this is our property '' . 
  well said . 
   banning any form of clothing is utterly wrong . 
  then why ca n't you wear an ss uniform in germany ? 
  i guess you are ok with that . 
   article 2 personal freedoms ( 1 ) every person shall have the right to free development of his personality ** insofar as he does not violate the rights of others or offend against the constitutional order or the moral law ** . 
  i can easily see the burqa being contested here and in many other ways . 
  france has much higher amounts of arab population , but not so many burqa wearing women . 
  this is due to french arab culture being quite different and having not integrated the burqa wearing culture which mostly comes from other islamic countries ( afghanistan , saudi , etc ) . 
  of course with daesh & radicalization , there are more arab women who are forced to wear this , but its still much more limited than in germany , due to it being illegal to wear since 2010 decree . 
   that does n't give anybody the right to ban people from wearing it even against their own expressed will . 
  individual decisions should n't be subject to societal approval as long as they do n't violate anybody else 's rights . 
  do you not contract yourself in quick succession here ? 
  a woman forced to wear a burqa by her husband is not an individual decision . 
  coming from a turk , this makes the point even stronger . 
  i am french and often visit germany ... 
  the contrast is stark . 
  you see quite many women in full burqa in germany as opposed to france . 
  saying this about southern germany ( bavaria ) , can not say if its the same in the north . 
  german society is getting islamized very rapidly , is my feeling . 
  nothing worse than a career politician . 
  it was still a staged event . 
   so , if it 's staged , what 's wrong about it ? 
  ca n't staged photos tell a story ? 
  nothing wrong when the nazis staged this i guess then . 
  nope . 
  there are clear staged shots in all wars . 
  owned !, 
  nice catch op . 
  photos like this are used all the time in the west to argue the case of intervening against russia . 
  eu also has largest economy and market in the world . 
  its the fault of the white german patriarchy , for pressuring them . 
  not daily mail . 
  bbc news + guardian . 
  and what i meant by `` german '' is german speaking regardless of ethnic background , which nobody in 2016 cares about now . 
  i never said that south tyrol was n't unified and harmonious . 
  i merely discussed its tumultuous relations with rome .

  you can always count on a ` strayan to be kind , 
  i love your translation x ), 
  this is a fair point . 
  but this would only be true for rather big post ; if it takes 10 lines instead of 5 , it does n't matter ( but 30 instead of 15 , yeah , maybe ) . 
  but maybe if you first write in english only , and then offer the translation after a line ... like this : the italics does kind of convey that this is n't `` actual text '' , and once you know that this kind of post is actually half as long as they appear , you 're not as put off as you could be , i think . 
  * d-d-d-d-drop the baguette * the sound would n't be that impressive , though :(, 
   do not pretend this is not the case at least with the french . 
  yet i will . 
  this is not the case . 
  be assured that everyone who is posting in both languages would be extremely happy if people from other countries were to do the same thing . 
   it hurts the flow of reading i think that if you write in two separate paragraph , it does n't change anything .

  do you agree ? 
  ( of course , the problem here is that it is in the middle of a whole comment ... i 'm talking about cutting the comment in two parts , top in english , bottom in whatever language damn well pleases you ) . 
  as for the arrogant vibe , i 'd say that being angry about bilingual posting is showing a saddening lack of curiosity :( i really enjoy the vast variety of languages in europe , and i think it 's be great if this sub were to showcase it . 
  * doxa to theo gia tous kartes tes gkoukl * so google is * \u0393\u03ba\u03bf\u03c5\u03ba\u03bb * in greek ?

  why two words ? 
   other nations learn a lot of obsolete english words it seems . 
  i do n't think he learnt it . 
  either he found it in a dictionary ( maybe an old one ? 
  ) , or he read it somewhere , and as it is the same word as in french , it stuck . 
  no , it 's a mix of french and english x ) dclauzel is french ( and the `` \u00e9 '' in `` m\u00e9gathread '' is a dead giveaway ) . 
  he got confused between his two languages , that can happens : / the real issue is that it happened for an important stickied post . 
  yeah , but in english it is apparently obsolete ? 
   a ok lets write every comment in all the european languages !, 
  i would n't see the problem , actually , if everyone were to write in his own language then in english ( or the other way around , i do n't care ) . 
  i 'd actually really like it . 
   the thing is that is very annoying to read a comment in two languages !, 
  no ... no , it 's not . 
  i mean , not for me , i ca n't say for you of course . 
   english is the international language today.get over it !!!, 
  yes , he is writing in english . 
  but also in french . 
  i really do n't see the issue . 
  yes , i am serious . 
  i find your suspicion pretty silly , really , but that may stem from the fact that i know him better than you do , that 's really not his style , i assure you . 
  well , not completely . 
  someone is n't happy about what dclauzel has done regarding the coverage of this attack ( the megathread is , according to him , a mess ) . 
  maybe dclauzel should n't have done that . 
  maybe he should have done differently . 
  that is a matter we can discuss , that is interesting . 
  but , yeah , just insulting the mod , and then going amok about french people who want to take over the sub with their filthy language , that 's petty bullshit : /, 
  no , the title is not in french : the `` in '' does n't mean anything in this context . 
  i agree that the title is n't in proper english , and this is a problem ( because it should ) ; but let 's not make a mountain out of a molehill : dclauzel is n't pushing some kind of french agenda to overtake / r/europe . 
  he just made some mistakes here . 
  no it 's not . 
  `` in '' is n't a french word , it would be `` \u00e0 '' ; the title does n't mean anything in french . 
  i think that dclauzel just made a mistake here . 
  when you write in english a word that also exists in french , it 's easy to forget an accent ( `` \u00e9 '' --  m\u00e9gathread ) ; as for `` attentat '' , well , he probably thought it was an english word . 
  please do n't misunderstand me : i 'm not happy with the title as it is . 
  it should definitely be in proper english . 
  but let 's not go overboard and start imagining that dclauzel is trying to impose french as the only official language for / r/europe , 
   and we are in no mood to have to learn yet another language why would you need to ? 
  he writes in both english and french ... 
  and instead of politely proposing a solution , or even just discussing , i decided to insult the mod . 
  i am in germany , i earn 200 $ and pay 300 $ : /, 
   the interpreter answers , `` i 'm waiting for the verb . '', 
  this is not a joke :( it happens way too often , and when the verb finally comes , sometimes i 've forgotten the sentence t.t that , and the numbers . 
  english : 123 --  one hundred twenty three ( 1-2-3 ) french : 123 --  cent vingt-trois ( 1-2-3 ) german : 123 --  ein hundert dreiundzwanzig ( 1-3-2 ) : * why * ?!, 
  in most situation , it 's not a problem , but i have a job where i often need to spell out numbers , or write down numbers that i 'm told , and this is brain-twister @_ @, 
  there was a post in / r/france recently about someone getting one . 
  but they 're rare , from what i know . 
   i 'm no fan of card payment you 're german . 
  of course you 're not . 
  in his defense , i think a significant number of them are possessed by the devil , because no matter what you do , you wo n't make it work , unless you call for the it guy , in which case the bloody thing will suddenly starts working properly when the guy opens the door . 
  yeah , but in france you get a hadopi letter politely asking you to stop . 
  not a $ 1,000 fine . 
  i ca n't believe those assholes who just ride their bike on this sanctuary . 
  someone should do something about it . 
  he 's dutch . 
  do n't be too hard on him . 
  thanks , 
   taxis are incredibly expensive no , the places where taxis are the most expensive are loz\u00e8re and corsica . 
  in paris , they are n't that expensive . 
  but i 've heard that they do try to sneak in a few detours : /, 
   what they said is very true , it 's exactly what i do when i have an appointment . 
  it 's what i do , too , but then i get lost on the way and end up arriving 15 minutes late : s, 
   the weather up there can change in a matter of minuets . 
  whereas in the rest of the uk , it just rains continuously . 
  it looks the the severed head of an angry owl . 
  what is it ? 
  in paris i had an american ^ ( i 'm being unfair , it was a child , so it was cute , but i wanted to bash on the americans like the cool kids do ) ask me if you could see the statue of liberty from the top of the eiffel tower . 
  oh , do n't take it the wrong way : we are . 
  we are just not telling you why . 
  [ god do i love this video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0yy23dbytek ) . 
  thanks . 
  i put all of my soul into it . 
  but .

  haha , look who 's speaking . 
  go back to your hamburger , you pick-up humping , gun-sucking redneck . 
   i hate the bottles made from floppy plastic , the rigid ones are so much nicer . 
  i 've read a freaking scientific paper giving credit to this theory of the hardness of the bottle influencing perceived taste . 
   in paris we consider that crossing lights are a suggestion . 
  to be more precise , you look at them to know if the car that prevented you from crossing is either an * asshole * ( red ampelm\u00e4nnchen ) , or a * fucking asshole * ( green ampelm\u00e4nnchen ) . 
  but you sure do n't pay them any attention * before * trying to cross .

there 's a difference between investigating based on the leads that you get , and simply publishing the informations with light fact-checking . 
  as it stands , the canard gets so much info that they do n't need to do much besides fact-checking to publish . 
  again , there 's nothing wrong with what they do . 
  but if we compare investigation to a journey in search of the truth ( and indeed , that involves finding informants ) , when it comes to the canard , truth usually comes ringing at their door . 
  does he monitor ur reddit ? 
   conducts excellent investigative journalism not that much  and are often the first to reveal corruption or shady affairs . 
  the reason why they are revealing so much is mainly because they 're the go-to media to rat out your colleagues . 
  most of their infos on politicians come from other politicians , for instance . 
  nothing wrong with that , ofc . 
  yeah , he 's from the ps ' right wing . 
  the thing is , he ( and valls ) never tried to compromise with the rest of the party , but instead they used their position of power to push their ideas , which are far from the platform that got hollande elected . 
  that sparked a sense of betrayal in their base , and that 's also why there 's been a rift in the party 's mps . 
  the last congress managed to restore unity in the party , but at the price of major criticism of vall 's policy -- on the paper . 
  we 'll see if they actually acknowledge this criticism ; however , i doubt they will . 
  as for winning an election , the reason macron could n't is not simply that he is a banker , but also that his political ideas would fail to net him enough voices on first turn . 
   but there 's less than zero chance of that ever happening . 
  the french electorate will never trust him . 
  he used to work for a bank . 
  maybe if he wants trust he should join a party that accurately describes his political opinion ? 
  he wo n't ever get elected because he chose to be named pm by a party whose voter base disagrees with what he stands for ... 
  op refactored the title to make it look like the left refuse criticism . 
  the party 's left is angry because an investment banker ( hollande 's campaign targeted the derives of investment banking ) , turned finmin thanks to a minority of the party that took over executive power , repeatedly shits on the party 's line . 
  also the people he gave the speech to and that gave him a standing ovation is a traditional supporter of right-wing economic policies . 
  this poll aims at capturing the current trend towards building the european union . 
  it is n't about what you think about it , but what you think will happen ( and why ) . 
  what will you say when your child asks why migrants did n't invest eastern poland ? 
   you 're gon na pop some veins with that one . 
  that was the plan all along . 
  first feed them `` french '' fries to clutter their arteries , then his . 
  he probably meant to advertise that reddit thing . 
  / r/hailcorporate, 
  / r/europe is still ressenting us from the last time we tried to conquer stuff . 
  so i think it 's best if we stick to selling weapons to ~ ~ dictators ~ ~ enlightened leaders . 
   please end this stupid shit , gone with monarchies . 
  we sell guillotines at very affordable rates . 
  our guillotines are guaranteed to work on monarchy ~ ~ and other people too ~ ~ . 
  for a modest premium , your guillotine will be delivered mounted on a mistral ^ ^ tm class warship , for increased protection against exiled monarchs . 
  pretty much like sch\u00e4uble 's antics made him popular at home . 
  there 's no such thing as `` the agricultural sector of france '' . 
  some parts of it ( some winemakers , cereal farmers , for instance ) thrive , while some other parts , especially cattlemen and dairy farmers , suffer a lot from distorted european concurrence ( both on wages and sanitary regulations ) and high pressure from their vertical peers in the industry . 
  i stay silent and stare at them begrudgingly . 
   than fostering start-up culture what is start-up culture exactly ? 
  also internet infrastructure is quite good in some europe cities . 
  the problem , as said earlier , is the lack of vc shops able to pour funding on companies . 
  it 's always been shit , so it 's not surprising that he found shitty patrons :p, 
  but you also sell military material to russia . 
  you just did n't cancel the deal ... 
  you 're confusing them with * r\u00e9seau voltaire * . 
  * boulevard voltaire * is a politically opinionated newspiece , but not a conspiracy theory echo chamber . 
  business insider + french bashing = < 3 . 
  just do n't read its news when it 's about france , they 're biased . 
  seriously , let 's look at the article in details : `` according to a damning report tuesday from boulevard voltaire , a left-leaning newspaper '' -  * boulevard voltaire * is a right-leaning newspaper , with a nationalist stance . 
  its collaborators include members of the right wing of our mainstream party . 
  `` india had initially wanted to purchase 126 new rafale fighter jets from france '' -  this deal has been discussed for years , and stuck for years . 
  it 's been known for about a year that the deal would fail . 
  basically , france had won the bid to enter into exclusive negociations , and from there , the expectations of indians and what we were ready to offer never met ( the main problem being that planes built in india were to be guaranteed by the french company ) . 
  it 's basically old news , nothing like `` about to '' happen . 
  `` india will instead spend $ 25 billion on 127 russian t-50 fifth-generation stealth fighter jets , a far cheaper and more advanced aircraft . '', 
  -  t50s had always been the first option for india , the rafale deal is a gap closer for the indian army before they receive these . 
  `` another two fumbled contracts with india and ** egypt ** '' ; `` meanwhile , france 's $ 5.2 billion deal with egypt for 24 rafale fighter jets is still going ahead '' -  so is the deal failing or going ahead ? 
  `` the french economy is currently experiencing slow economic growth and is carrying debts of 98.43 percent of gdp , or $ 2.2 trillion . '', 
  -  mandatory footer in a bi article about france . 
  to sum it up , bi just requotes a partisan article looking to pin economic `` problems '' on the current president , changing some details to make it look credible . 
  i 'll go and make a scientific comparison : it 's like electrons , you ca n't observe them without modifying their behaviour . 
   complaining about having too many visitors makes no sense . 
  at some point , you just ca n't handle tourism . 
  when some places are like 95 % careless tourists and 5 % locals ( hello rambla ) , it becomes hard to even handle the load . 
  it 's even harder to handle all the illegal business done there , and for the local shops and life to compete against the tourism-catering industry . 
  a good example is the boqueria market , where legitimate clients can barely move around because there are so many people coming to watch them doing their market . 
  as the historic marketplace is being replaced by tourists and shops designed to accomodate tourist needs , it becomes clear that this market place has switched from an exclusively local place to an exclusively touristic place . 
  the feeling about it currently is that it gives less that it takes ( and especially , the people that benefit from tourism are n't the ones that suffer from tourism ) . 
  currently , the tourist places like boqueria , la rambla , el gotico and all the guell-related places are a cesspit of careless tourists , being there is a drain . 
  interesting areas are elsewhere . 
  as it stands , citizen simply push to reclaim these areas and make them worthy of interest again . 
  stuff like subventions on planes tickets can and should be targeted to reduce this mass tourism . 
   there is no country in the world that thinks international agreements should never be renegotiated there 's a difference between never and often . 
  i 'm pretty sure you would frown at your reps if they edited a bill every week . 
  international treaties , and especially those needed to create a strong political union , need stability . 
   electors are the exact people who should be the ones that want the renegotiation to happen . 
  if people want to rengeotiate , it is the job of goverment to do it . 
  but as it stands electors are dependent on government and politicians in general to know what 's possible . 
  no one is going to refuse a free sandwich , right ? 
  the problem with british politics is that your politicians extend promises and perspectives to their electors , which they ca n't expect to negociate without pissing their international partners . 
  we also have some of these politicians , but luckily they 're nowhere close to being elected , and consequently they do n't put much pressure on international treaties . 
   king about a renegotiation of agreements , not a breach of them . 
  there is nothing unreliable about a renegotiation well , other countries have a different opinion on the matter . 
  especially when calls for renegociation are publicly discussed in a bid to attract electors . 
  i suspect that the brits were too hapy to parade the new gdp number to think twice about the implications . 
  i remember distinctly uk officials making comments about how they were such in a good shape and talking about rolling the red carpet to french expats , for instance . 
   international agreements can be renegotiated and should be renegotiated at times . 
  if the elected representatives of the uk people think that the eu budget should be reduced it is the job of the uk government to renegotiate it . 
  but then , you understand that other countries ca n't count on you as a stable partner ? 
   the uk parliament voted for our contributions to the eu budget to be reduced . 
  coming back on past international agreements because your parliament changed its mind is one thing , but that also means your international partners are probably going to see you as unreliable . 
   there is massive waste in the eu budget . 
  how is waste related ? 
  there is always gon na be waste in human endeavours . 
  honest people do n't shoot down said endeavours because of the waste . 
  germany ? 
  there 's a painful outbreak every so often , but out of that it 's benign and you can live with it ?

article : [ ** jeremy corbyn says there could be benefits to opening diplomatic back-channels with isis ** ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/jeremy-corbyn-says-there-could-be-benefits-to-opening-diplomatic-back-channels-with-isis-a6817181.html ) video : [ ** andrew marr show , january 17 ^ th 2017 ** ] ( https://youtu.be/rfltpxb1mqe?t=19m09s ), 
   but what movement is being referenced here ? 
  the political correctness `` movement '' . 
  the black lives matter `` movement '' . 
  essentially , as much as it 's an oxymoron , the * regressive * part of the progressive movement . 
  --  this is just glamorized malice and self-righteous egotism . 
  of course it is . 
  because the political correctness `` movement '' is all about being holier-than-thou . 
  as much as this phrase is overused , it is an oppression olympics . 
  it 's about proving racism where it does n't exist . 
  it 's about applying a standard to others , which you do n't reflect back on yourself . 
  it 's about having a black lives matter riot to protest the self-inflicted death of a black guy . 
   * the independent police complaints commission has launched an investigation into charles 's death . 
  the met said charles was seen `` trying to swallow an object '' and that an officer `` sought to prevent the man from harming himself '' . 
  *  https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/jul/28/demonstrators-dalston-london-protest-death-rashan-charles --  i ca n't see how the creation of this video was justified , not least by the gallery itself . 
  of course it is n't , particularly , given that the [ scottish national portrait gallery is taxpayer funded and government managed . 
  ] ( https://www.nationalgalleries.org/about-us/who-we-are ) but think about the sort of people who study the arts , it 's nearly all left wing people . 
  it 's unsurprising that they 'd abuse their position to inject their ideology into the public sphere . 
  https://twitter.com/ap/status/872124426233548801  breaking : french interior minister says notre dame attacker cried ` it 's for syria '  @ap - associated press, 
   is clearly fallacious . 
  there was a period of over a century in which ireland was represented in parliament , which obviously refutes the claim that ireland had no representation in any parliament . 
  representation by the descendants of [ protestant ( i.e anglican ) land-owning settlers ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/protestant_ascendancy ) , who had colonized ( ireland during in [ the plantations . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/plantations_of_ireland ) you can call that representation , i 'd call that foreign rule by proxy . 
  in the 122 years when we were part of the united kingdom proper , we spent 29 years when catholics could n't even become a mp , and 86 years where other limits placed on irish people becoming mps . 
  also , as for being `` representative '' of ireland 's wishes : * [ first home rule bill ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/first_home_rule_bill ) : 1886 ( defeated in house of commons ) * [ second home rule bill ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/second_home_rule_bill ) : 1893 ( defeated in house of lords ) * [ third home rule bill ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/third_home_rule_bill ) : 1914 ( defeated 3 times in lords , only passed after government overrode the hol , never actually implemented ) if the house of commons was * so * representative of ireland , why did it not support ireland 's wishes ? 
  british rule in ireland was self-serving , and never in the interests of irish people . 
  end of . 
  we had no representation in the government which ruled us for the best part of 800 years , whether or not we were given token representation for 50 does n't matter . 
  the point still stands . 
  but i also wo n't acquiesce to false claims about it . 
  just because it was clearly morally bad does not mean that it 's also ok to make up claims about moral wrongs that are n't true . 
  or , you know , actual history . 
  why is it that : * the head of [ famine relief ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/great_famine_ ( ireland \\ ) ) in ireland , [ sir charles trevelyan ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sir_charles_trevelyan,_1st_baronet ) , had this opinion of us :  `` the judgement of god sent the calamity to teach the irish a lesson , that calamity must not be too much mitigated . 
  ... the real evil with which we have to contend is not the physical evil of the famine , but the moral evil of the selfish , perverse and turbulent character of the people . '', 
  * [ lord salisbury ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/robert_gascoyne-cecil,_3rd_marquess_of_salisbury ) , prime minister and secretary of state for foreign affairs , had this to say on irish home rule :  `` you would not confide free representative institutions to the hottentots [ savages ] , for instance . '', 
  it 's not just immoral , it 's bordering on willful negligence . 
  so , [ 1171 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lordship_of_ireland#transformation_into_a_kingdom ) to [ 1800 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/acts_of_union_1800 ) , did n't happen ? 
  you can be pedantic and say that was n't when ireland was part of `` the united kingdom '' , but we were [ ruled from london ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kingdom_of_ireland ) , laws were passed by a parliament of [ protestant landowner settlers ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/protestant_ascendancy ) , and irish people/catholics were systematically discriminated against , by laws put in place by that ruling class . 
  and then , even after we became a full part of the united kingdom , the penal laws were only fully repealed 69 years later , its fair to say that most of the ill treatment happened before the act of union , but its lying to say that irish people magically were treated the same , by virtue of the act of union . 
  and then , lets not even start on northern ireland : * [ a protestant parliament for a protestant people ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/a_protestant_parliament_for_a_protestant_people ) , gerrymandering of northern irish electoral districts to maintain unionist majority , even though 4 of the 6 counties have a nationalist majority . 
  * [ royal ulster constabulary ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/royal_ulster_constabulary ) , a quasi-paramilitary police force , with literally no catholic representation , which [ held lighters to kids testicles ] ( https://www.journeyman.tv/film_documents/4952/transcript/ ) , [ attacked kids ] ( https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/reports/uk927.pdf ) and [ colluded with loyalist terrorist organisations ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/royal_ulster_constabulary#loyalist_collusion ) * housing allocation : in order to do the gerrymandering , housing allocation was done along sectarian lines , which not only furthered sectarian divisions , but also allowed people to be disenfranchised as only the owner and their spouse in a house , was given the right to vote . 
  still want to defend british rule in ireland ? 
  i respect the northern irish peoples right to self-determination , which currently supports remaining within the united kingdom , but do n't tell me that british rule in ireland was somehow good , it has only resulted in violence and division . 
  once we finally got proper representation , we swiftly used it to leave the united kingdom , if that 's proof of anything , its proof that british rule in ireland was not wanted . 
  edit : and to be clear , i 'm irish . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/penal_laws_ ( ireland ) * exclusion of catholics ( from 1607 ) and presbyterians ( from 1707 ) from most public offices . 
  * catholics and protestants banned from intermarriage , without converting to protestantism . 
  * catholics barred from holding firearms or serving in the armed forces . 
  * bar from membership in parliament ( from 1652 to 1662 , 1691 to 1829 ) . 
  * catholics did not have the right to vote [ ( disenfranchising act 1728 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/disenfranchising_act ) , until 1793 ) . 
  * exclusion from the legal professions and the judiciary ; repealed ( respectively ) 1793 and 1829 . 
  * education act 1695 -- ban on foreign education ; repealed 1782 . 
  * bar to catholics and presbyterians entering trinity college dublin ; repealed 1793 . 
  * on the death of a catholic , their family could only inherit by conversion to the church of ireland . 
  so , yeah . 
  stop talking out of your ass . 
  yeah , it 's probably qualified doctors , rather than doctors working for the health service . 
  http://www.rcsismj.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/chalikondal-emigration.pdf we have a massive oversupply of qualified doctors , but not enough money to hire them all , so they emigrate , primarily to the other anglosphere countries . 
  edit : relevant part . 
   ireland currently has the highest number of doctors working abroad , with 47.5 % of our doctors outside the country . 
   wait a minute ... there are no eu countries that give citizenship through birth , right ? 
  right ??? 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jus_soli there are , but with restrictions : country | restrictions : -- | : -- ireland | born on the island ( incl . 
  northern ireland ) , to a least one british or irish citizen parents . 
  uk | if by age ten , at least one of your parents is a british citizen . 
  france | if one of your foreign citizen parent , was also born in france . 
  greece | if you are not automatically eligible for foreign citizenship at birth . 
  spain | if born to someone legally domiciled in spain at the time of their birth . 
  germany | if at least one parent has a permanent residence permit ( and had this status for at least three years ) and the parent was residing in germany for at least eight years . 
  edit : ireland was the last european country to have [ unrestricted jus soli ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/twenty-seventh_amendment_of_the_constitution_of_ireland ) ( 2004 ) . 
  yeah , if you have that system , the following referenda would not have passed : ( despite them having large majority support ) year | referendum | yea | nay | turnout : -- | : -- | : -- | : -- | : -- 2015 | [ irish same-sex marriage referendum ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/irish_constitutional_referendums,_2015 ) | 62 % | 38 % | 61 % 1971 | [ swiss women 's suffrage ( at federal level ) referendum ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/swiss_referendums,_1971 ) | 66 % | 34 % | 58 % 1997 | [ scottish devolution referendum ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/scottish_devolution_referendum,_1997 ) | 74 % | 26 % | 60 % 1975 | [ british european community membership referendum ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_kingdom_european_communities_membership_referendum,_1975 ) | 67 % | 33 % | 65 % 1994 | [ finnish european union membership referendum ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/finnish_european_union_membership_referendum,_1994 ) | 57 % | 43 % | 70 % 2003 | [ czech european union membership referendum ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/czech_european_union_membership_referendum,_2003 ) | 77 % | 23 % | 55 % 2003 | [ estonian european union membership referendum ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/estonian_european_union_membership_referendum,_2003 ) | 67 % | 33 % | 64 % i mean , i love the irony of the previous eu membership referenda . 
  so , the uk leaving the eu is so important to the uk that it should require a supermajority , but the finnish , czech and estonian referenda on joining the eu are n't important to those countries at all ? 
  the only referenda i can think of with more than ~ 75 % turnout and 60 % in one direction are : year | referendum | yea | nay | turnout : -- | : -- | : -- | : -- | : -- 2013 | [ falkland islands sovereignty referendum ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/falkland_islands_sovereignty_referendum,_2013 ) | 99.8 % | 0.2 % | 91.94 % 2002 | [ gibraltar shared sovereignty referendum ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gibraltar_sovereignty_referendum,_2002 ) | 1.03 % | 98.97 % | 87.9 % 1938 | [ austria 's anschluss `` referendum '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/austrian_anschluss_referendum,_1938 ) | 99.73 % | 0.27 % | 99.71 % 2014 | [ russia 's crimea annexation `` referendum '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/crimean_status_referendum,_2014 ) | 96.77 % | 2.51 % | 83.1 % 2014 | [ donetsk 's self-rule `` referendum '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/donbass_status_referendums,_2014#referendum_in_donetsk_oblast ) | 89.07 % | 10.19 % | 74.87 % 2014 | [ luhansk 's independence `` referendum '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/donbass_status_referendums,_2014#referendum_in_luhansk_oblast ) | 96.2 % | 3.8 % | 75 % like , the bar he is setting for referenda means they have to be either : * not even necessary , due to the clear support in one direction ( gib and fi ) * a sham , with the [ obvious ] ( http://i.imgur.com/7enmfoy.jpg ) voter [ intimidation ] ( http://totallyhisto.ry.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/anschluss-ballot.jpg ) , and done under military occupation . 
  just because a person disagrees with the result , does not give them the right to demand the system should be different , if it had been the other way round , they 'd be saying that it had `` settled the issue '' and that there is `` no need for another one '' . 
   first paragraph . 
  we 'll have to refer to the opposing viewpoint as something , why do n't we just accept them naming their movement as whatever they like , and have a substantive debate about the issue , rather than giving them free ammunition to say `` these people are immature . '', 
  this referendum wo n't be won like the same-sex marriage referendum was , that was a shitfest where half the debate was arguing about how to debate properly . 
  without a proper , substantive debate on the issue , people will vote no by habit , rather than take the risk . 
   second paragraph . 
  exactly , that 's basically what the oireachtas is going to decide before the referendum is put to the people , whilst constitutional convention was a neat political vehicle to advance the abortion referendum without having fine gael and fianna fail implode due to tds breaking the whip , we 'll now see how far the government is willing to push it . 
  preferably , you 'd want it up until the baby is viable , but if they push it too far , the debate will turn into `` but a baby at x weeks can survive '' , and people will vote the referendum down because they can not support the ending of a viable babies life . 
  with the issue of fatal foetal abnormalities , it 'll throw a spanner in the works , because whilst we do n't want to force women to carry babies that are going to die , if the cut-off point is too far along , you 'll have the same issue as above . 
  the problem with roe vs. wade is that the arguments were being made to a court of rights , rather than a court of public opinion , whilst a judge could accept that abortion should be legal until one second before the woman goes into labour , on the basis of their rights , the vast majority of people would never accept the intentional ending of the life of a fully formed baby , at such a late stage . 
   third paragraph . 
  probably , my only concern is that if we lose this referendum due to stupidity and immaturity shown by `` pro choice '' campaigners , the movement towards having another one will be dead in the water , and there wo n't be another one for a long time . 
  particularly , if there is a brexit/trump election-type twitter meltdown by pro-choice people . 
  although , i honestly do n't understand the `` look at the countries we are on the list with argument '' , it can be completely turned on its head , particularly when we have [ ** the fourth lowest maternal death rate ** ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2010/apr/12/maternal-mortality-rates-millennium-development-goals ) in the world . 
  there are some lists where ireland ranks highly , and some where we do n't , its the same for every country , and so its not a great argument when you consider most of europe does n't allow [ ** gay marriage ** ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/timeline_of_same-sex_marriage ) . 
  added this in , basically what i 'm saying is , would it be fair to say poland is literally saudi arabia because it does n't allow gay marriage , ignoring the fact that the situation for lesbians and gays in both countries are completely different . 
  to make this relative to abortion , whilst we are on the same list as sharia-law dictatorships when it comes to abortion , its disingenuous to say that healthcare for pregnant women in ireland and say , iran , are somehow comparable . 
  for example , [ ** malta ** ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-38235264 ) , our english speaking friends in the eu , ban abortion completely , with no exceptions , which is harsher than in most muslim countries . 
   you 're not debating here . 
   you 're just taking what i 'm writing and adding your own context to it . 
  i and i presume you are both firmly in the pro-choice camp . 
  we were n't debating . 
  my point is that outside of the `` college bubble '' , the vast majority of irish people will not take kindly to the arguments you are putting forward , it 'll just be seen as immature and avoiding debating substantive topics about the issue . 
   it does n't read well and you 're coming across very aggressive . 
  i apologize if i seem aggressive . 
  i 'm just sick of hearing `` pro choice '' supporters solely view the issue through their own world view lense , and not accepting that their viewpoints will not translate well into talking points when trying to convince undecided voters , who will be vital to winning the referendum . 
   debate me on the issue and properly address my points or do n't debate me at all .

  and apparently some other bullshit about how big russia and how small france is . 
  and if he plays nice , putin will make him the king of europe . 
  now people claim that putin was talking about nukes or about killing sarko . 
  but that does n't make any sense . 
  you do n't start a nuclear war cuz someone bad-mouthed you . 
  and you do n't get that many occasions to kill another head of state . 
  what i believe is that putin told him that if sarko does n't play ball , he 'll leak information about gaddafi 's money . 
  it only makes sense . 
  gaddafi was close to putin so i 'm sure he told him about the fact that he gave sarko money . 
  this was an actual threat to sarkozy and the fact that he went in thinking he 's jesus and came out being told that if he does n't shut up he 'll be impeached and sent to jail ... that 's fucking big . 
  also after , when the georgian crisis happened , who did russia talk to exclusively ? 
  not with merkel like in ukraine , but just sarko . 
  and he came out looking well after that conflict . 
  and now 2011 rolls in . 
  there are some tensions between medvedev and putin but 2012 is just around the corner and putin will become once more the full boss . 
  what does sarko do ? 
  push quickly for an invasion to remove his once upon a time friend from power so that all traces of sarkos financing problems disappear . 
  well first of all climate was very different since sahara was n't as big and the nile created a very fertile area . 
  and money comes where trade happens . 
  and trade used to happen a lot near the sea since a big boat can carry much more than animals on land . 
  this kinda shows why the romans never really bothered to fully conquer germany . 
  what 's the point ? 
  money was n't there . 
  of course . 
  you can only be so poor . 
  while rich ... it goes to infinity and beyond . 
   this sub rejoyce of the idea of macron , i 'm pretty sur he is the worse than can happen to us ( except mlp straight in 2017 the guy has no project as of yet and has no party that will follow him in the legislative elections . 
  this means that we 'll have a cohabitation meaning gridlock . 
  i still believe that ff would be worse if he eliminated 500k govt employees and dismantles the secu . 
   modern warfare is n't based on an official declaration of war anymore . 
  well / u/hematophagian is talking about war and not about military operations . 
  none of the things you talked about involved existential threats to netherlands . 
  and if you think that no threat will ever happen , dismantle your army . 
  that 's an easy thing . 
  what 's more hard if what happens when a country asks for help , like it happened in mali . 
  what happens when a terrorist attack happens in a country and one has to fight back against that organisation ? 
  like it 's happening in syria . 
  what happens when a country does not have the means to patrol its borders efficiently like italy ? 
  many countries have very particular needs , especially the ones with a significant military power , while other countries have different needs . 
   the netherlands does not require parliamentary approval to use the armed forces , not from our own , and most certainly not from yours . 
  the guy is talking about going to war , not deploying troops . 
  i 'd be extremely amazed and worried if netherlands can declare war without parlament approval . 
   the reason airbus works as a civilian company is because it 's not micromanaged . 
  considering that [ 20 % of airbus ' revenues ] ( http://www.airbusgroup.com/int/en/investors-shareholders.html ) come from airbus defence and space ( and it does n't include airbus military choppers ) , no airbus wo n't stop working on military projects any time soon . 
  maybe the cross-govt thing bothered them . 
  they got burnt by the us also . 
  me smell bias :  for 2016 as a whole , growth in the eurozone outpaced that in the us by 1.7 per cent to 1.6 per cent . 
  * outpaced * by 0.1 pp for one year . 
   mr nielsen of unicredit points out that , over the past decade , growth of gdp per head in the eurozone averaged 1.9 per cent a year , `` not a huge difference '' to the 2.4 per cent rate recorded in the us . 
  he adds more of that growth will have been felt by ordinary families in europe , since inequality is not rising as fast as in the us . 
  but 0.5 pp yearly difference over 10 years is not an actual huge difference . 
  okay . 
  what was the previous net ? 
   depends . 
  getting out of eu + euro will get you negative growth for at least a decade , compared to that zero growth sounds promising . 
  hey , we can do zero growth then growth ... but i 'm not seeing any growth in italy . 
  are you ? 
   i love how people forget things can always be worse , a lot worse . 
  stagnation is n't that great of a thing considering that our population is increasing . 
   the taxpayer via the government . 
  there is no implicit assumption that the money will go towards lowering taxes . 
  in fact they never do . 
  they usually go to this or that part of the budget . 
  if you do n't work in this or that part of the govt branch that gets an increase , you wo n't see any actual benefit . 
   perhaps look at the word ` implicit ' in the dictionary . 
  well as a owner of these companies i am for corporate taxes . 
  how about that ? 
  this is the dumbest conversation ever . 
  as a society , we 've decided we want corporate tax rates . 
  end of story . 
  we estimate that it is a fair thing to tax companies that use the roads of this country , the stability offered by the military . 
  etc etc etc. 
  no company is forced to do business in a country with corporate tax rates . 
  end of story . 
  have no idea https://ro.wikipedia.org/wiki/salariu_minim_pe_economie, 
  where 's my owner deed ? 
  i did n't get one . 
   they 're completely owned and run by people . 
  in france , the state can own corporations . 
  and many big companies are indeed owned by the state . 
  in the us , the govt did own a significant chunk of banks or automotive companies when they had to bail them out . 
  are you saying marianne and uncle sam are real people : o mind = blown . 
   poor labor laws compared to ... what ? 
  asia ? 
  the americas ? 
  africa ? 
  well belgium is n't in a common market with asia , americas or africa . 
  workers can not freely travel to belgium , nor can employers hire people in romania that will work for periods of time in belgium or other countries . 
  there is a problem with posted workers https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/posted_workers_directive_1996 there are about 200k in france , mainly from poland , portugal and romania . 
  you can send a worker to another country for up to 2 years and only need to pay the social securities of the country where they come from . 
  but glad to see romania 's doing their job in creating a fairer market . 
  just this february , minimum wage has increased to 320 euros from 275 . 
  ( let 's see if the economy will crumble like so many people have said ... i wo n't hold my breath ) . 
   so , who 's the one we hope wins ? 
  is it macron ? 
  yeah . 
  he has the most eu flags at his rallies . 
   despite having more power than the us president , i feel that 's a myth . 
  as cheeto benito has shown with his eo orders , the us president actually has a ton of power . 
  a lot of french eos have to be signed also by the ministers .

   whatever may be one opinion on the subject of homosexual marriage this was the only good thing she did ... 
  in now two years . 
   fleur pellerin in my opinion she did the job rather correctly in the middle of this monkeys crew . 
   while segolene did not much and duflot was a walking disaster i was specifically referring to them . 
  segolene should not be here , the french people & her political party have already spoken . 
  period . 
  my point was : would they be there is it was n't for the sake of gender balance ? 
   voting agaisnt someone though is not that stupid . 
  there was no point in reconducting the failed sarkozy who didnt improve the situation , and i do n't want to vote against * someone * , i want to vote against a program i do n't believe in . 
  i have more and more difficulties to locate myself in the current political landscape . 
  one thing is sure , the current government is almost empty of talented people and unbelievably full of unqualified people . 
  the gender balance is also a joke , i 'm not anti women ( i believe that lagarde was one of the best of all , please present yourself at the next election ) but i 'm really anti `` positive-discrimination '' . 
  people are very keen to bring the failed mandate . 
  i 'm far from a pro sarkoziste but nobody is ever able to bring facts and figures ( compared to other countries in the same situation ) that his policy was a huge catastrophe . 
   you seem to be willing to vote against holland yes i was because his program was born to fail like any other ** pure ** socialist program . 
   but people just want to believe the charismatic man telling them everything is going to be okay withouth making any sacrifices . 
  he is as charismatic as a rocking chair and i 'm not into furnitures . 
  i still deeply think dsk was the only decent option . 
  maybe he would have prove me wrong , but it can not be worse than what we have now . 
  and i also believe in the conspiracy theory . 
  he was already elected without declaring himself candidate , way too dangerous for ps & ump majority . 
   a new governement and a new president could set those reform in motion nailed it . 
  we ( they ? ), 
  should have never go for the full retarded ps , it never worked and was really far from the appropriate government we needed in those time . 
  people are just plaint stupid , they just vote against someone without even having a look at the programs of candidates . 
  we now face the consequences of this poor choice . 
  i guess it 's picked up from french where it 's also the same thing . 
  the glorious european dragon . 
  why stop at the head ? 
  think bigger !, 
  can i be your war minister ? 
  or minister of home affairs ? 
  we can merge both for cost efficiency reasons . 
  annexation for aesthetic reasons . 
  i like you . 
  are you presenting yourself at the next european elections ? 
  crush , obliterate , surrender ... repeat again ... 
  can we physically visit it ? 
   `` fifty six million people used to live here ... now it 's a ghost town . '', 
   only because they could n't afford the extras . 
  it 's less part of the french military doctrine to be explicit about foreign operation . 
  we have two completely different approach of war ( and external communication ) between the usa and us . 
  and it wo n't make things any more clear . 
  what 's wrong with you ? 
  if it was , he would only speak french , you are way too focused on something that is n't an issue . 
  i would n't mind if people would put it in their native language as well . 
  hey , it 's / r/europe , we all speak 2 or more languages , why not share with others ? 
  no , a lot of noisy people are like that . 
  i firmly believe that most people just fear to be flagged as racist and simply shut their mouth . 
  care to tell me why ? 
  we are having that kind of reports from very different newspapers/sources , from different political side . 
  they are not trying to push that kind of shit with a political agenda . 
  let 's make them transit in laponia for some months . 
  just to select the real refugees and the fuckers . 
  it 's not like it 's the unique case we have here . 
  we have reports like this every fucking days . 
  good plan to take some holidays . 
  it 's also infuriating for most europeans . 
   are n't they are running away from radicals in their home country ? 
  hearing how much and about what they are complaining in sweden and finland , i doubt they are running away from anything . 
   they go to germany to get jobs and better future for their children/family ( free education , healthcare , housing ) . 
  which jobs ? 
  really depends of the country . 
  getting ready for the zombie apocalypse ? 
  do they have some pork in it ? 
  those intolerant bastard ... 
  buuuuuuuurn, 
  so they can actually reform the religion ? 
  the berseker ? 
   it 's not germany . 
  it 's just ~ ~ these mentally ill guys ~ ~ the current german government . 
  ftfy . 
  the shariah is actually effective ? 
  and i agree with it 100 % . 
  well , as an american , no necessarily with a lot of money you integrated without particular efforts from the fins , right ? 
  why should the person most begging for coming ask for twice as much effort ? 
  they are not entitled to anything from me or any other european , their situation is sad , but i do n't owe them anything . 
  they should be grateful enough to be here , period . 
  no need to blow themselves up to thank their hosting country ,, 
  sorry mate , but why should i ? 
  in all honesty , i volunteer for other persons in need , why should i help people integrating ? 
  is n't it you that should make an effort ? 
  it 's exactly why we should be way more careful in our approach of accepting refugees . 
  our leaders want to rush with unbelievable quotas and in the meantime putting in danger our own citizens . 
  let 's take the situation way more rationally , you do n't lead a country with emotions . 
  if we do n't act -  we are to blame . 
  if we act -  we are to blame . 
  forget arguing with that kind of guy . 
   let 's just remember here that the ` right to self-determination ' is a human right . 
  so if i follow your logic , it would be perfectly fine to have paris declaring its independence ? 
  they have right to self determination , and they also want to be an active partner in the eu . 
  or i can also declare my independence , because i disagree with how my money is spent to pay jobless people ? 
  we can stretch this logic without limits . 
  and once again , i would do a lot for my european brothers , nothing for someone who want to damage them . 
   as far as i 'm aware they want catalonia to be an independent state within the eu . 
  no thanks . 
  i do n't need people who are ready to backstab me at the first sign of weakness . 
   also you really do n't live by the motto of france , maybe you do live by the `` values of europe '' ( whatever they are as they seem to vary rather widely from country to country , which include catalans ) . 
  i do , and it includes solidarity , remember ? 
  if the uk was as much part of europe as spain , i would .

  if only the mistral deal would have succeeded we might have turned a blind eye on russia as well !, 
  ca n't happen since deputies can delegate their vote to a colleague , the party then organise the count as to prevent what you said . 
  basically only 101 deputies physically showed up but virtually they were all present . 
  edit : just want to point out this is the common practice for a law , in this case indeed only 101 votes were physically and virtually cast . 
  but it 's a resolution the government does n't have to follow it . 
  as to what you said in another post :  mps have a job , and that job is parliament it 's true but the parliament in france is n't strong enough to fight the executive power on a law even if the government has a very weak majority so as a result they are better doing something elsewhere . 
  plus most of the parliamentary work is done inside commissions . 
  britain to get it back and bury it in saint helena , the queen organizes a coup during the euro 's final and invades france . 
  calais becomes a french enclave in british territory . 
  i wonder who 's the unexpected general that will come save us this time . 
  i said germanic languages speakers have an advantage not that there is some mystical prophecy keeping the french and only them from speaking english . 
  indeed the same reasons can apply to many , yet when it 's about france a stereotype seems to be more convincing to many people . 
  i agree with you , my point was that there is a lot of pragmatic reasons as to why it 's harder to learn english in france compared to let 's say norway . 
  i just feel like perpetuating the stereotype of the arrogant frenchman that does n't want to speak english can sometimes reinforce the lack of confidence you were talking about . 
  that was just a little ( and probably bad ) joke to show that `` special treatment '' is only a go-to term that can be used against every country ever . 
  nothing serious, 
  france being afraid to loose its culture because of english is pure stereotype though , bad english proficiency in france is mainly due to different language families and economical protectionism is exactly that , economical . 
   just more french `` special treatment '' . 
  yeah sure protectionism only exists in france . 
  no states ever try to favor domestic production . 
  you 're brave using the term `` special treatment '' with a british flair though , / r/europe has no chill on those things . 
  i 'm actually somewhat in favor of the quota but yeah it 's pretty much killing creativity when artists keep making profits because it artificially keeps them on the spotlight . 
  well reddit is a good place for you if you ca n't stand paris . 
  and between the french riviera , french alps , the loire valley , st-barth and so on i do n't think the rest of france is overlooked by tourists . 
  but as opposed to some of those places tourism in paris is n't the main and only activity , hence that maybe the city is n't always perfectly suited for tourists despite its reputation . 
  he already went to italy . 
  and even in paris they stick to ultra touristy spots with countless african illegal sellers . 
  i mean i took german in highschool yet i find it easier to understand spanish . 
  reddit likes to praise scandinavians for their english abilities and shame italians/french/russians / whatever for their lack of but english is a germanic language and they do n't seem to understand it 's a quite big thing to overpass . 
  meanwhile i 've been to portugal a lot and met a few spaniards and it was never hard to communicate . 
   united states of america  ua - spies can steal great works of art .

  [ enjoy your stupid water wellington . 
   france swung right ? 
  i feel like things are being blown out of proportion . 
  it 's the first round of regional elections , it 's not comparable to poland 's case . 
  yes le pen 's rise is pretty alarming but y' all need to stop looking at scary maps of france covered in scary fn colors . 
  `` r\u00e9gions '' have limited and specific powers and the elections are n't even over yet . 
  i feel like you 're slightly misinformed on french politics if you seriously think they will have so much effects on media . 
  you hear more about it on reddit than anywhere else . 
  i really like trains too , i 'm glad we found common ground !, 
  tram connections and romance ? 
  i do n't think you know the city well enough if you think that 'd be the best assets of a city as powerful and integrated into the global economy as paris . 
  reddit seems to hate paris more than non-parisian frenchmen , which is impressive . 
  well it 's a strong national symbol of identity and unity , singing it creates a feeling of community . 
  it 's pretty weird to do everyday ( do americans really do that ? ), 
  but on special occasions why not ? 
  it 's the job of the state to assure public order though and in the case of flying an isis flag the threat of disruptive events happening because of it should be more important than this little limit to freedom of speech . 
  i think it 's about a balance between freedom of speech and public order ( n \u00b0 7 of the decision ) , given the historical relevance of the holocaust in france denying it would cause far more troubles hence justifying a restriction of free speech . 
  this is my interpretation but you could certainly find hypocrisy in the decision . 
  they considered denying the holocaust was by nature racist and antisemitic therefore justifying a restriction of free speech ( [ decision ] ( http://www.conseil-constitutionnel.fr/conseil-constitutionnel/francais/les-decisions/acces-par-date/decisions-depuis-1959/2016/2015-512-qpc/decision-n-2015-512-qpc-du-8-janvier-2016.146840.html ) ) . 
  the french constitutional council has in the past declared such laws contrary to the constitution ( [ here 's the decision ] ( http://www.conseil-constitutionnel.fr/conseil-constitutionnel/root/bank/download/2012647dcccc_647dc.pdf ) ) based on a violation of free speech . 
  it is then pointless to go up in arms about this news every time it 's posted . 
  is that book version ramsay bolton ? 
  wow the show is really toned down . 
  i agree , i think the power of the media and politicians on public opinion is over evaluated on reddit . 
  a lot of time we are more influenced by the community we are from and the leaders inside those groups than by the newspaper we read . 
  medias and politicians have a bad reputation , a lot of people are wary about them and it 's easy to blame them for a lot of things ( not that they are totally innocent obviously ) . 
  internet gives a way for people to spread their opinions and those with an agenda to push know the influence they can have on a community both online and irl . 
  normal people can be as rotten and dangerous as politicians and media . 
  wallonia is half of belgium , french guiana is just a giant space centre . 
  i 'm glad there 's still someone that has faith in us but i think you 're the only one surprised here . 
  although spaniards in my experience are the best at integrating into the french society so i 'm not surprised if stereotypes about french rudeness are n't as strong there as they are in the us/uk . 
  we ca n't blame police and intelligence agencies when they fail at doing their job ? 
  the population can adapt all it wants to war there are not the one that can stop terrorist attacks . 
  and i fail to see how we 're living like we 're at peace considering that ~ 10 000 soldiers have been deployed in the streets under sentinelle , vigipirate has been at attack level alert since january 2015 , borders are closed and airstrikes are conducted over syria . 
  hollande even said [ `` france is at war '' ] ( http://www.lemonde.fr/attaques-a-paris/video/2015/11/16/hollande-maintient-sa-position-la-france-est-en-guerre_4811152_4809495.html ) ? 
  most terrorists have been known to intelligence agencies before their attacks , took trips to syria , smuggled weapons in france , planned and executed attacks in major french cities yet those responsible for our safety are not to blame , ok . 
  [ here 's a good summary . 
  ] ( http://www.monde-diplomatique.fr/img/png/ppa-1-4.png ) source : http://www.monde-diplomatique.fr/cartes/ppa, 
  and cameron said he would '' [ roll out the red carpet ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/jun/19/david-cameron-wooing-french-tax-exiles ) '' for french businesses when hollande wanted that 75 % tax rate , get over it it happens all the time . 
  countries are in competition , it 's silly to take it personally . 
  how full of yourself do you have to be to not take seriously a group that just took a country out of the eu ? 
  refusing to acknowledge anything not going your way is nothing but fear . 
  paint them as evil idiots and you will only make them stronger . 
   long term wellbeing of human society and the planet are we still talking about the eu ? 
  it 's an economical and political union not the return of jesus , do n't you think you 're going * a bit * too far ? 
  you 're pretty deluded if you think the whole debate around the eu is a simple good vs evil . 
  i thought after brexit people would realize it 's time to change rhetoric . 
  that looks more like a top 5 most hated countries according to the internet to me . 
  even then , austria ? 
  where did you get those top 5 ? 
  [ see this poll by gallup : france and germany are nowhere near hated in the us , quite the opposite in fact . 
  ] ( http://content.gallup.com/origin/gallupinc/gallupspaces/production/cms/poll/zzfhnowloe-s3r9yw4lc9a.png ), 
  my first comment as a brit and i already got one , someone bring me tea so i can pretend to be polite while i silently judge him . 
  the uk , because i have to admit ... annoying the french sounds very fun . 
   they will pass this law by enforcing an article ( 49-3 ) that should be used in case of crisis i.e like war . 
  just because everybody seems to be discovering this article does n't mean it 's meant to be used only in urgent apocalyptic situations . 
  that 's exactly the problem with the the current french constitution , the president was meant to be impartial and his powers were to cut through the political drama ( dissolving the assembly , calling a referendum etc ) . 
  since the practice of de gaulle during the algeria crisis and the reform to make the president elected by the citizens he now combines `` referee '' and political powers ( which he took from the pm ) . 
  that created a major power imbalance and you can also see the current french republic described as semi-presidential . 
  it 's pretty interesting to see the political similarities between turkey and france here . 
  i just find it strange that mps would agree to give up their power to choose the president . 
   why should he bother ?

  but we 'll survive . 
  stop judging man . 
  why you so close minded ? 
   alcoholism is associated with depression . 
  that 's for normal people . 
  not for russians . 
  trust me . 
  let your country get invaded and they will be happy  also praise putin, 
  ryanair is irish . 
  easyjet you probably mean . 
  also i found that easy are a bit better than ryan . 
   didnt bring them happiness yes it did . 
  they drunk themselves to death partying . 
  i 'm telling you man , you do n't understand the slav, 
   was important word here . 
  neah some countries remain sadly uninvaded . 
  poland for example, 
   russia is sad country but i want to make it happy country . 
  well apparently them invading other countries make them happy . 
  so you know what you got ta do , 
  took 4 months for egypt to admit that the sinai crash was a terrie attack . 
   egypt has said terrorism was more likely than a technical fault to have caused egyptair flight ms804 they did n't even bother getting the black boxes for this one and they 're claiming a terrorist strike . 
  interesting . 
  you should visit the thread where they 're talking about uk getting aircraft carriers . 
  so many sad people . 
  for a country of its size and spending , i think they do n't really want it that badly nor that quickly . 
  what are some global uk interests ? 
  ive never seen anyone take so much pride in such a terrible thing . 
  as russians ? 
  really ? 
  surely you must be joking . 
  also they create jobs and put money in the economy . 
  you have a naive view on how the world works . 
  why would n't china want to project power ? 
   russians weapons killed tens if not hundreds of millions of people . 
  yeah . 
  because only russians are proud of arms ... no one ever cheers for their military or anything . 
   they shouldnt be ashamed weapon low quality but ashamed they export so much death . 
  i 'm not ashamed france is high . 
  if we 're not selling our stuff , others will . 
  heck we just fulfil a need . 
  other countries offer subsidies to buy weapons from them . 
   formidable asset to project force , not really to defend the territory . 
  why is n't china really pursuing that and instead of going for the cheaper more interesting carrier killer missiles ? 
  before getting out your pitchforks ( paging / r/pitchforkemporium ) why not wait and see what happened in detail ? 
  is it too much to ask ? 
  ah right reddit . 
  also muslims . 
  the perfect storm . 
   low quality weapons . 
  well people are buying . 
  a lot https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/arms_industry#world.27s_largest_arms_exporters, 
  yeah but credit where credit is due . 
  russia put the larget effort in developping the soviet space program . 
  [ because i bet you love russian tourists ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/20/world/europe/russia-may-aid-comrade-tourists-who-were-really-soldiers.html?_r=0 ), 
  it 's difficult to measure wealth , its value and meaning . 
  how much is a million worth to a billionaire vs to a poor person . 
  usually a logarithmic range is not a bad way to go around it . 
   we never had cities renamed after communists onesti was called gheorghe gheorghiu-dej between 1965-1990 . 
  making the interesting situation where a town was named after a dude that was named after a town . 
  lumping croatia and switzerland ? 
  in what way makes sense for example ? 
  netherlands with france but not with germany ? 
  really ? 
  the cultural lines make only sense from a geographical point but in no way from a cultural one . 
  it can only create more confusion than help people understand cultural dynamics in europe . 
   secondly , they do a lot , things whose absence you would feel a lot ... and most of them things i would n't want to put out here on reddit . 
  yeah . 
  good one . 
  finance us or bad things will happen ... 
  seems closer to 1916 europe than 2016, 
  this map is kinda weird . 
  sometimes it takes time to find out who you really are . 
   wellbeing of sardinia check unemployment levels http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/file:reg_unemployment_rates_2015_en.png corsica joining italy would be bad for it . 
  that 's one stupid ass expression . 
  alongside bleeding heart liberals . 
  and this is literally hitler . . 
  a civil war is coming . 
  italians have an embarrassing present . 
  i found that the words that work best are : `` you worry too much about russia . '', 
   schumacher over battiston : no foul ! '', 
  everything here is n good humor . 
  let 's keep it like that ok ? 
  you 're a failed country . 
   `` terroir is such a nebulous concept and it does n't stand up well in blind tests . '', 
  well that one 's true . 
  to be fair cdg and orly are 2 airports . 
  so i guess 80k is n't too much then . 
  http://www.lefigaro.fr/actualite-france/2016/05/19/01016-20160519artfig00086-vol-egyptair-paris-le-caire-la-surete-aerienne-francaise-en-question.php since some people are asking , 70 people were removed from working in high security zones at cdg and orly since november 's attacks . 
  out of the 85k people working there ( can this number be right though ? 
  85k is a huge number ) . 
   so now what 's your argument ? 
  well i wan na know who to call when my rights are being abused . 
  i am speaking spanish in spain . 
  i want muh rights . 
   that 's the plan ... oh yeah , 
   spanish is already forced , and no catalan law can `` unforce '' it . 
  ok i 'll be sure to go in some tiny catalonian village and ask the local bar to speak spanish for me  . 
  i 'll tell you how that goes . 
   without protectionist laws , most products sold in spain would not be labelled in spain .

  edf , sncf , la poste , orange , ... incidentally those companies provide service damn important to the country so they are listened quite a lot when they do strikes . 
  i mean if people do n't come to vote , they ca n't really complain then . 
  the government may have been happy ( though that may not be sure ) , i would n't say the population was happy , they did n't really had a choice . 
  even with 51 % he will be as legitimate as with 100 % whatever they say . 
  and they should n't do that because it 's very risky . 
  but melenchon and le pen policies are n't that far to be honest so maybe they want her to win ? 
  yeah keeping the electoral college system but allowing the votes of each state depending of the result in the state would be way more logical and democratic imo . 
  as it is , it 's kind of useless to vote for the side opposite to the one which is predominant in the state ( like republican in california or democrat in texas , it 's basically useless ) . 
  so as it is , only a few states ( swing states ) are really important in an election . 
  also the fact to really only have 2 parties that arrive at that level is kind of weird . 
  even that would n't do it probably . 
  it would take something like a scandal on macron ala fillon imo or a very big communication error . 
  it has very little chance to happen to be honest . 
  while we should n't call it before it happens ( and he should n't just stop campaigning and opposing le pen ) , aside from something like a scandal on macron ( ala fillon ) , macron is very likely the next president . 
  yeah i know but in other societal issues ( immigrations , security , . . ) he went towards le pen . 
  i see it as le pen-fillon close on societal issues while going in opposite ways economically ( where fillon is closest to macron indeed ) . 
  melenchon-le pen kind of close economically while going on opposite ways societally ( though not really , just who would benefit from the social help ) . 
  thanks , it is very interesting actually . 
  i just thought it would be more logical to follow popular vote country wide but i guess it makes sense for the voice of all states to be heard ( though it would be kind of normal if higher populated areas had more weight in the end ) . 
  i think the system is actually quite adapted for us if all states would pass to the proportional vote following their own popular vote ( the maine and nebraska system ) . 
  best of both systems kind of . 
  i mean what we call right wing for france . 
  yeah compared to uk or us we 're leftist i guess . 
   you seriously think that people from the left will vote for the far-right ? ... 
   the economic positions are n't that different actually . 
  le pen ( idiotic imo ) economic ideas are not some liberal thing that we could expect for something called `` right '' . 
  it 's basically not so far from melenchon ideas . 
  the problem is a racist tendency that would n't appeal to them . 
  but the idea to `` give to the poor '' ( to caricaturize ) is there on both sides ( when the poor are french at least for mlp ) . 
  i do n't see why liberalism ( normal right ) is associated with nationalism ( far right ) to be honest . 
  imo the liberalism is anything but racism imo . 
  le pen is anti-mondialisation for example which is n't a liberal economic policy . 
  it 's also one of the problems for lr this election , they went a lot towards those racist ideas imo ( while still keeping a liberal economy policy ) . 
  yeah to be honest , the us system is completely archaic and dumb imo . 
  why do n't they just count the popular vote of everyone at once ( and not by state , it 's a federal election after all ) ? 
  yeah probably , especially since many voters ( myself included this year actually ) often do n't vote for someone but more against someone ( that 's basically how hollande has been elected in 2012 tbh ) or at least the `` less worse '' . 
  yeah it 's not that easy . 
  macron is seen by many of melenchon voters as the `` finance '' or from the policitcal system which they wanted to reform . 
  while i 'm not sure they would be more for le pen , they might just not vote second turn and that often help the fn . 
  as for fillion voters , even if there is a clear call to vote macron there , the voters will probably be divided between the two candidates . 
  while i do think macron 'll win pretty easily ( and the polls were pretty clear for now ) , it is n't a good thing to already call it . 
  melenchon voters are n't exactly ok with macron for example ( the economic policies are n't exactly the same ) . 
  though i do n't believe they are for le pen either ( for clear reasons ) , they may have a strong absententionism in second turn which helps the fn most of the time . 
  the party does n't seem to call a vote either for now . 
  so probably either macron or nothing for them . 
  as for fillon voters , the party personalities clearly call for a macron vote . 
  but fillon has won the primary and was probably the candidate the closest to le pen in ideas . 
  so it 's not sure the voters will follow this . 
  i see a division le pen-macron in those voters . 
  so the campaign is n't over and macron side should n't believe that at all imo . 
  because being confident is a big risk . 
  so very likely he win but it 's not done yet . 
  while i do think he 'll win pretty easily , it is n't a good thing to already call it . 
  melenchon voters are n't exactly ok with macron for example ( the economic policies are n't exactly the same ) . 
  though i do n't believe they are for le pen either ( for clear reasons ) , they may have a strong absententionism in second turn which helps the fn most of the time . 
  the party does n't seem to call a vote either for now . 
  so probably either macron or nothing for them . 
  as for fillon voters , the party personalities clearly call for a macron vote . 
  but fillon has won the primary and was probably the candidate the closest to le pen in ideas . 
  so it 's not sure the voters will follow this . 
  i see a division le pen-macron in those voters . 
  so the campaign is n't over and macron side should n't believe that at all imo . 
  because being confident is a big risk . 
  edit : also saying it 's already won may incite many voters to just not bother especially considering the date of the second turn ( it 's in the middle of a 3-day week-end there ) . 
  macron already got plenty of supports ( mainly from ps and lr parties ) . 
  you know politics ( at least here ) , they 'll do what they need to keep their positions , even change party . 
  yeah imo they can pass second turn easily ( even each time and even in first ) but when there is a 2 turn system i doubt they 'll ever win the election . 
  except if they do something like 40 % + at first turn but that is very unlikely to ever happen . 
   france is a leftist country there have been more right wing governments than left . . 
  le pen going to second turn is a good thing actually if it 's macron with her . 
  then , it eliminates fillon and melenchon right away and mlp does n't have much chance against any of the candidates on second turn . 
  there is a duel to the death between the two second candidates . 
  yeah it never happened in less disputed elections . 
  this year ? 
  will never happen, 
  let 's say he is against the current eu . 
  problem is most of what he wants would probably not be possible to negotiate so that would lead to the exit referendum ... 
  the extremes voters are always really hard to predict . 
  they can vote le pen for `` outside the system '' and if so , fillion is the worst on that . 
  they also want more `` socialism '' in a way ( except just for french ) , they are n't liberal . 
  imo right and far right are pretty different . 
  however , fillion has a speech kind of close of marine le pen in all the immigrations question so that may help him there . 
  he 'll probably reinforces those points if he is in second turn without mlp . 
  what 's the point of having a cake and not eating it though ? 
   the poll reports 95 % chance that the election results are within 0.8 % would they be able to give us results at 8pm like usual if it 's so close ? 
  it 's always based on temporary results so i wonder if they could do a mistake or something or would prefer holding off . 
  imagine someone think they are at the second turn with temporary results , do a victory speech and learn just after they are n't qualified . 
  would be fun ( or not depending of who is that person ) . 
  in france , it is almost always there for political discourses , on any official building and such . 
  it is seen almost as often as the french flag to be honest . 
  in the uk , you never really were in the eu in spirit let 's be honest  . 
  sadly for you , he is into ( much ) older women than him so if you already find him `` older '' , you might not be right for him . 
  will merkel stop being reelected one day . 
  i feel like she 's there since like 20 years . 
  are n't you bored of her ? 
  yeah melenchon-le pen would be the most probable for her to pass ( and to be honest melenchon is n't better either , he 's also anti-eu ) . 
  if it 's someone else , the margin may be smaller than what i said but i do n't think she pass either ( even with all fillon votes which would n't happen ) . 
  i did n't say all newspaper or media were like that ( though totally unbiased news probably does n't exist ) but figaro and lib\u00e9ration are pretty known for that . 
  also , you 're pretty right , i am indeed moderate and for macron there ( more because it 's the best amongst what we have than really passionate for him tbh ) . 
  and how do you know which candidate i support ?

  we have a low growth . 
  if we have this greater union this fight between france and germany will be as relevant as a fight between california and washington . 
  we are on the same boat everyone use is neighbor . 
  we sell our diplomatic power against their economic power . 
  the european union is an ecosystem . 
  this is a symbiotic union were everybody gain and loose something . 
  i do n't see germany as our rival but more as our friends , coworkers and customers . 
  the power will stay in france as long as we are a union the day we will become a federation we will benefit of both . 
  this is how i feel this union but if something go wrong we still have our maginot line at our border , 
  i am pretty sure that italian have a bigger crime problem than the migrant . 
  it would be funny, 
  this is true only on the economic field . 
  we have more power on the diplomatic and military level with our army , the nuclear weapon and our permanent seat to the un . 
  i am not bragging about the fact that my country is better than the other but france have a special place in the union . 
  if we achieve full federalization france will give to the union a diplomatic stance than few country would have . 
  europe will be on the same position as china and us a superpower . 
  in europe only uk have the same diplomatic power as us and it is a shame that they do n't want to use it for the greatest good this mean giving to the union more critical thinking . 
  we are so much eurosceptic that we want to keep the euro and the union . 
  even the fn doubt on this subject . 
  they do n't want shengen but a lot of them want the euro, 
  damn leftist and they self hating ideologies / s, 
  well you ca n't be relevant and having no problem in the same time  . 
  he want to see the union burn so much that he want to join us in the fire . 
  he is part of nato and the european concil . 
  he hate us so much that he make a lot of bilateral treaty with the union . 
  it was funny why this much downvote . 
  in orange are the country who will be invaded soon . 
  in green those who will be annexed later . 
  only people who have nobel prize can live there . 
  imo it is why they are safer . 
  because there is few people to watch and few people to protect . 
  but what you said is true this make it hard to compare huge population . 
  for them we need statistics who them self are measured differently even between oecd members . 
  well we just write the part when we fight with you . 
  us , china and the arabs golf country does this to it does n't seems like this stop us to trade with them . 
  in europe we have country like andorre , vatican city , monaco , luxembourg iceland , norway and swedistan and they choose poland as the safest ? 
  just wanted to make a pun but yes you are right . 
  why not being totally franc with our history and say it begin in belgium, 
  being on the good side of history is our speciality after all . 
  this land have a name . 
  it is called east thrace, 
  why not some human right and enlightenment ? 
  if a stranger manage to take those job this mean that they wanted it more . 
  here in france we here a lot of this kind of sentence from the far right . 
  stranger take the job than no french would like to take . 
  why would you take a hard and underpaid job if you can those sweet allocations . 
  in the end of the day the job is done , the boss is happy the worker have a salary and the national will not have to do this inhuman job for the same income that he have now . 
  if this argument is not enough let say that when a immigrant work a have a salary some of it will come back to his home and the rest goes to the national economy and it will fuel a lot of business and maybe make new businesses . 
  pax germanica, 
  damn it always french people, 
  when they talk about making a grand paris they were dead serious, 
  they should have hungary . 
  and all tyrol for the sake of not having a border gore, 
  like the lebanon and syria were french protectorate . 
  they are a huge probability that they know some word of french . 
  not as much as the north african though . 
  what you say is still true anyway, 
  the romanian ? 
  because aside no one aside of the turk will visit istambul, 
  if muslim really went full jihad they would be more than a thousand dead per year in europe, 
  gipsy are better than algerian to take our money too . 
  this must mean that some voter expect them to act like this . 
  sure they are better at taking our camera / s, 
  why would the government prioritize foreigner than the national voters ? 
  damn romani people taking better picture than us / s, 
  the child are mixed les enfants sont metisses, 
  well convert to islam is not an exceptional thing.for the rest it was probably kept secret . 
  it was mentioned in the article that the father was atheist and did n't know about the goal of is wife . 
  we can assume that he is immunised to islamist ideologies to whom he lost is wife and child . 
  but anyway we should check is background too even if there is a huge chance that it is a fine guy . 
  no just the french and innocent child.at some moment we should take it back from the mother . 
  i agree on the position to let the mother outside but damn we have return the kid to the father, 
  and the child ? 
  good child . 
  we should have more of those light hearted news . 
  cyprus is not european . 
  all island in the mediterranean sea are not european . 
  that being said they are culturally in so it is ok . 
  you are totally right . 
  i will try to make it very clear . 
  now politician will focus on the rape problem by the migrant or by the priest . 
  and they will do this until the next big thing ( brexit or anything else ) . during this time a lot of people are raped and their situation will never change.the culprit are free . 
  if only we try to focus on societal problem instead of some mediatic event maybe in the end something will be done . 
  no this is a conspiracy . 
  they just hide the true number . 
  we all know that half of the union is already muslim . 
  i totally agree . 
  but rape are the kind of crime that often stay unpunished . 
  because the family try to hide their shame , because of pressure on the victim or because of juridical loophole . 
  if we gave half the mediatic coverage given to the refugee crisis or even the koln rape tragedy to the problem of rape in general we would push the politician to do more about it . 
  no paedophiles are a problem for all countries . 
  if we find a way to solve it in our society . 
  this mean incite the victim to accuse the criminal and this system is effective enough to prevent rape inside of the family circle . 
  no matter which population we have we should be able to prevent a lot of tragedies . 
  i am a full catholic and i know the difference between criminals and innocent . 
  and i want this logic of innocent until proved wrong to all category of population . 
  that being said can you explain more what are the difference between raping and rapping . 
  not at all i really think that we should punish the rappist harshly . 
  what i do n't like is by denouncing the priest the muslim we forget that there a really high number of rape inside the society who will stay unpunished . 
  it is like the story of this economist who loose is key in the dark and will only search them under the lamp because this the only place who have light .

   good intentioned progressivism from the torries and may that wants to pull uk out of the ecthr ...  but it 's not so much the government does n't respect free speech so you agree people should be arrested for saying : `` i asked a muslim woman to explain the brussels attack '' . 
  noice  heck i really hope uk will get out of the ecthr . 
  the amount of pop-corn ... 
   however , that is a free speech issue , rather than a privacy issue . 
  so we 've established that : * 1 ) your govt does not respect your free speech * 2 ) your govt does not respect your privacy but you think that they wo n't use your private data against you ? 
  are n't you an optimist . 
  what if you write a tweet like say `` i asked a muslim in croydon to explain the terrorist attacks '' ? 
  should you get arrested for that ? 
   they 're only looking for terrorists and serious criminals , they 're not spying on everyday people . 
  http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/arrests-for-offensive-facebook-and-twitter-posts-soar-in-london-a7064246.html be careful what you say on reddit . 
  i wo n't want you to get arrested , 
  i have no idea why you 're getting downvoted man . 
  uk has a history of arresting people for their tweets or fb posts . 
  http://www.theverge.com/2016/3/24/11297128/matthew-doyle-arrest-muslim-tweet-brussels http://www.theregister.co.uk/2016/06/02/social_media_arrests_up_37pc_london_section_127_communications_act/ http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/article/19269353/uk-too-heavy-handed-with-twitter-and-online-trolls, 
   oh no the government is compiling all of the pepe memes i use for when the illegal pepe act of 2018 is brought into effect so that they can arrest me straight away with all of the evidence they 've gathered on reddit . 
  http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/arrests-for-offensive-facebook-and-twitter-posts-soar-in-london-a7064246.html  ) oh man . 
  i did n't know you had deserts in uk . 
   they care about the ones planning mass murder that 's why they got ta read every email ...  ) oh man ... to be young again . 
   it 's the national health service , not the international health service . 
  well do n't they still have rights ? 
  confidential info should remain confidential regardless of the status of the person . 
  an illegal immigrant has the right to confidential legal counsel , why should that be different for medical data ? 
  but you told me that you 'll do better in all stats . 
  i feel lied to . 
   okay , let 's do top 20 eu vs uk : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_nobel_laureates_by_university_affiliation * eu : 5 * uk : 3 to cut the crap short , academia is all about connections , building networks in order to exchange ideas . 
  that 's the most important aspect . 
  the anglo world can share to the level of 450 million . 
  french can share only about 80 million , germans about 90 million . 
  i guess we 'll have to send m\u00e9decins sans fronti\u00e8res to uk . 
   we should not be finding the worlds healthcare . 
  if you do n't want to look for good healthcare , at least go look for a good spellchecker . 
  getting 500k in 8 years for no work ? 
  that 's extremely convenient yes . 
   if they chose any other ranking type fields medals . 
   or how about we do it the other way round . 
  fields medals by institute of graduation so we can test teaching too . 
  i 'll also wait , 
  thatcher famous for her no no no . 
  european unity famous for [ this ] ( http://www.lamontagne.fr/photosrc/w1ztj1fdutgibhvogwyshgynqduvgfdfvv9fwkm-/francois-mitterrand-et-helmut-kohl-le-22-septembre-1984-a-do_2653188.jpeg ) . 
  i know which one i 'd pick . 
  they have the best arguments :  mr malloch added that any attempt by the eu to block britain beginning negotiations with the us would be `` absurd '' and like a husband `` trying to stop his wife having an affair '' . 
  but you lost the karma : o, 
  they actually do n't !, 
   care to address my point ? 
  if not , i 'm done here . 
  i 'll simplify my comments here . 
  european defense army will have to be the original 6 + spain . 
  this will create a core group that is independent from us influence and can act independently from whatever the wishes of the current president are . 
  this needs to be done in order to deal with the unique defense needs of europe . 
  all the other countries are not really relevant here , since they can not either : offer any amount of support that is actually noteworthy , do not exactly have a mic so they can not contribute in terms of r&d , or are too susceptible to us soft power . 
  see , it 's easy . 
   if anyone is not a big power can join as vassals . 
  welcome to the eu/nato any type of organisation really . 
   well that is , like , your opinion , man no . 
  it 's fact . 
  sweden and ireland would not joing a military union . 
   would freedom of movement also apply to the future harkis and pied noirs ? 
  does it apply to people who obtained asylum ? 
  yes . 
   why on earth would would this have to be a single thing with a binary decision ? 
  they can collaborate but then again we can collaborate with a ton of people . 
   sweden you do realise that they 're not even in nato , right ? 
  why would they join a military alliance when they 're very happy where they are . 
   f portugal , the czech republic , greece , belgium , netherlands , hungary and austria have a cumulated contribution to the eu army that is larger than france 's , okay . 
  they way it looks now with defense budgets that does n't seem to be that case http://www.globalfirepower.com/defense-spending-budget.asp  the eu is built on dialog , a european defense army would not be based on any eu framework . 
  it would n't make any sense to do that . 
  that 's why consensus does n't work here anymore and the amount of power you have matters . 
  case in point : nato goes wherever the us wants it to go . 
  okay . 
  so that 's your plan on projecting power . 
  a few dummies with suicide vests . 
  that 's a great example . 
  scales really well . 
   even isis as you may have noticed . 
  so the portuguese plan is to strap on some suicide vests and blow yourself up ? 
  yup . 
   given that french and france are irrelevant . 
  are they making the pasteis salty these days ? 
  cuz they seem so delish . 
  what do they put in ? 
  tears of portuguese ? 
   so , you believe that those with little \\ no power should have no voice . 
  i am confused . 
  what word as a portuguese do you want in the matter on eu defense ? 
  if it were spain sure , that 's a big country with many capabilities . 
  but portugal ? 
  i 'm not trying to be obtuse or stand-offish . 
  i am genuinly asking . 
  in what shape or form could or should portugal comment on military matters when its military is so small ? 
  the army is n't about consensus . 
   f you are not hot for the principle of consensus - fair enough . 
  a european defense army would not be attached to the eu . 
  we already made mistakes by growing past our means with the eu meaning old members decided to leave . 
  a few core countries like the first 6 + spain would be plently enough . 
   but then you 'll have to explain to me why the ees should not heavily prioritize territorial integrity . 
  ee can do whatever it wants with their army . 
  but i 'm guessing they 'll rather be in the european defence program than outside it ... with you know ... trump and all that . 
  chile got attacked by al qaeda ? 
  damn boy . 
  you sound salty as fuck .

  kitchen, 
  i do n't know what 's worse , the sushi burritos , or the [ kit kat pizza ] ( http://i.imgur.com/h3behsi.jpg ) from japan, 
  what you call bread , and croissants in the us . 
  i would n't give to eat to my worse enemy . 
  peanut butter is an american thing i could get but do n't like . 
  i 'm just too used to nutella i guess . 
  most french games do n't take place in france . 
  heavy rain , beyond two souls , the nomad soul , rayman , dishonored ... my personal favorite is prehistorik man for the super nintendo , that game was awesome , i do n't think it 's very famous though . 
  yes another adventure one that 's really good is life is strange . 
  a very unique feel with a great story ( it 's french ) . 
  i do n't . 
  i 'm not even baptised . 
  my father is n't either and neither were his parents so i would n't say everyone has one , 
  american english kinda sounds like they have a hot potato in their mouths . 
  the witcher 3 is great and european ( from poland ), 
  yeah i 've also heard that about tours but i have no idea what they sound like . 
  paris is still the `` standard '' french i think . 
  the fuck, 
   i do not like the part when everyone you meet greets you with '' \u0425\u0440\u0438\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0441 \u0432\u043e\u0441\u043a\u0440\u0435\u0441\u0435 ! '', 
  ( `` christ is risen !, 
  '' ) , and you are supposed to answer with '' \u0412\u043e\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0438\u043d\u0443 \u0432\u043e\u0441\u043a\u0440\u0435\u0441\u0435 ! '', 
  ( `` indeed risen ! '' ) . 
  the things you learn in this sub !, 
  that sounds pretty funny to me but i can understand how annoying it might be after a lifetime of hearing this, 
  no sadly nothing fancy in the french passport, 
  i honestly doubt it . 
  a lot of americans seem to genuinely think they live in the best and free-est ( ??? 
  not sure how to say that ) country in the world . 
  why would we want more americans i do n't understand the reasoning . 
  there 's a lot of zealots ( as you said ) in the usa too . 
  very problematic . 
  what about american-muslims for example ? 
  being muslim is not a nationality , anybody can be a muslim and discrimination against a religion is something europe does n't want to do again . 
  and i doubt there 's a lot of americans that would want to move to europe . 
  how do you increase it ? 
  we ca n't force americans to immigrate here ( not that we would want to , it 's fine if americans want to come live in europe but it 's not something we `` need '' ) . 
  people living in poor countries or where there is wars are gon na leave no matter what so i do n't know . 
  looks like the only way to decrease immigration is taking care of the source of the problem . 
  easier said than done . 
  also it is not europe 's job to educate americans on social democracy and make them more open minded , we are n't a summer camp ,

  the harassment is in the word itself .

  there is no hatress in xenophobia . 
  xenophobia is the fear of foreigners ( fear of other cultures ) . 
  this fear is present in what you call `` ethnic nationalism '' : you fear that your culture may disappear/lose its purity/lose its territorial suppremacy if foreigners come in mass . 
  so , in my opinion , this is not `` completly different '' as you wrote . 
  it is subtely different . 
  ethnic nationalism could not exist without xenophobia . 
  i am interested in your words . 
  what is the difference between ethnic nationalism and xenophobia ?

  from this point of view , we are reaching our goal better than we could have wished '' . 
  the original quote is '' * gouverner c'est pr\u00e9voir * '' / `` to govern is to anticipate '' ( emile de girardin , journalist and politician from the xixe ) . 
  there is a pun '' * pleuvoir/pr \u00e9voir * '' , `` to rain/to anticipate '' . 
  there is a pun , but you need to be knowledgeable to understand it . 
  it 's a wit . 
  highjacking the first comment to `` promote '' a related ( dead ) subreddit : / r/strangehumans /, 
  i think that this situation comes from the `` primaires '' ( unofficial primary open elections organised by moderate parties ) . 
  this leads to a far right leader ( fillon ) for the moderate right party and a far left leader ( hamon ) for the moderate left party . 
  the right leader ( fillon ) has been caught paying his family with fake jobs . 
  the left leader ( hamon ) has no charisma . 
  as a result the polls are now keeping : - `` announced '' far right ( le pen ) . 
  anti-migrants . 
  anti-euro . 
  - centrist/social liberal ( macron ) . 
  like the current government . 
  - `` announced '' far left ( m\u00e9lenchon ) that has a really big charisma .

  i suppose most people do . 
  so seeing `` france '' written can get confusing . 
  though ultimately , `` slovenia '' is written as well . 
  i find it weird that there 's `` france '' written on the slovene coin to be honest  i 'm pretty sure some people get confused . 
  belgium has such a prolific comic book `` industry '' , they have many fictional characters to choose from which at least were created by actual belgians . 
  tintin for example . 
  i personally like french , german and irish most , though the latter could have a little diversity between the coins . 
  and , like most people here , the monarch heads coins are the least interesting to me . 
  estonia 's is pretty uninspired as well ( just an outline of the country ... ) . 
  in france we naturally encounter spanish , german , italian and belgian coins the most . 
  otherwise , we regularly see almost all the other coins , though admittedly , the micronations ' coins are rare . 
  really ? 
  i find the birds and flowers on the finnish 1 and 2 euro coins very uninspired . 
  the lion on the finnish cents is pretty nice though . 
  how dare you insinuate that a flan is spanish !, 
  i personally do n't think he should be punished at all if it 's `` hate speech '' . 
  however i 'm for punishment if it 's calls for violence , though one could say there 's a thin line between the two . 
  i would n't say france is the outcast , but rather the one who talks to everybody and hangs out with everybody and feels like he 's part of everything , to an extent that he never stays long enough with one person to make a close friend , but is still integrated enough with everyone to not be rejected , and to not feel like a loner outcast . 
  norway is the depressive goth , even though he has \u00fcber rich parents . 
  i 'm pretty sure you could call fascist italy a fascist country and the fascist government would n't bat an eye , 
  yeah , same goes for some vichy french officials who were only charged for their war-crimes decades later . 
  most notably maurice papon , who was only starting to be charged in the early 1980s ... while he was a minister of the government !, 
  greece has a much smaller military capacity and budget than the uk and france , and lacks nuclear deterrence . 
  i know greece spends more on its military on average , relative to gdp . 
  that 's good . 
  greece is a good student in that regard . 
  but ultimately , i 'm sorry , greece is n't enough on it 's own , without nato and eu backing . 
  france is n't either , mind you . 
  oh , and you 're welcome for our support for your independence . 
  ps : france kicked invading italian 's asses just as easily as the greeks did , and we were fighting the germans at the same time . 
  and i can also uselessly quote adolf hitler you fucking dipshit : `` it 's another proof of the theory i 've always defended , that the french are , after us , the best soldiers of europe . 
  france will always be in a situation , even with their current birth rate , to form a hundred divisions . 
  after the war , we will absolutely need to build a coalition capable of containing militarily this country capable of accomplishing such military feats which astonish the world like in bir hakeim '' . 
  - 1942 do n't let your apparent hate-fueled rage and irrationality step into this argument . 
   we really do n't have any tangible threats and why 's that , do you think ? 
  because usa/nato , and because the uk and france are around , and have shown their capacity to intervene , and have military deterrence . 
  not everything works on diplomacy alone , not to mention that respectable armed forces , military and nuclear capacity , are political assets , no matter how sad that fact is . 
  if all countries in the eu had the military commitment of ireland , we may as well give up the eastern half to russia , and the western half to the us - and i do n't think what i 'm saying is that much of an exaggeration . 
  of course not . 
  you 're lucky the us has your back , and you 're lucky to be in a union which includes countries which have a military worth a damn like france and the uk , or countries like turkey and russia would be stepping all over you , and your interests . 
  from what i 've heard from ukrainian protesters , they simply want closer ties with the eu rather than with russia , because they consider that the eu will help end the corruption in their country , and is an opposition to russia . 
  i remember one protester even considering the eu was more like the `` lesser of two evils '' . . 
  it had nothing to do with being more pro-eu than pro-ukrainian as op suggests . 
  they consider it 's better for the ukraine to have closer ties with the eu . 
  and ukraine which is smack in the middle of both superpowers has to pick a side regardless . 
  to be honest though , most mainstream music we hear in france is either french or from an anglo-saxon country ( mostly us and uk ) . 
  there are of course some notable bands/artists from other european countries , but they 're pretty much dwarfed by anglo-saxon music , and national music . 
  i 'm pretty sure it 's the same all over europe . 
  you mentioned a couple famous german bands . 
  personally , i ca n't name many more from other european countries ( i 'm speaking about fairly mainstream bands . . then i listen to metal so of course , i thus know many european bands , but only metal bands . . 
  i 'm pretty sure those who know another subculture , like techno and all , know their fair share of non-anglo-saxon bands as well ) . 
  i mean , do you know any current french mainstream artist ? 
  maybe superbus ? 
  i hear they 're somewhat known out there . 
  they made it to guitar hero , so that 's something i guess . 
  yeah , that particular sketch might resonate in this subreddit :p though one still needs to understand french to get the jokes . 
  [ norman ] ( http://www.youtube.com/user/normanfaitdesvideos/videos ) is by far the most popular so i guess it should be linked . 
  otherwise , for classic sketches like monty python , in france there 's [ les inconnus ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/les_inconnus ) who were huge in the late 80s and 90s . 
  i think they 're brilliant . 
  they do typical french humor though , so i do n't know if they 're for everyone . 
  but many frenchmen can quote some of their lines . 
  that dish looks fucking good !, 
  i definitely recommend `` un proph\u00e8te '' , for a good recent gangster/prison film . 
  also , in a similar genre : [ mesrine ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mesrine_%282008_film%29 ) is a two-part film about a real life french gangster who was involved in many incredible heists . 
  good films , with vincent cassel . 
  i have n't seen the last one , but the first two films are definitely very enjoyable . 
  they 're also the most european films ever , as the main theme of these films is being european - and it 's thus a multilingual film , though french , and english , are the most used languages . 
  what bothered me with `` casse-t\u00eate chinois '' at first glance is that it strays away from europe per se , at least in its title . 
  but that 's perhaps the point of the movie . 
  maybe something about there being globalisation beyond just europe . 
  yeah . 
  i knew this guy from my university , in his twenties , who was a native speaker of breton . 
  not a dialect of french of course , but a regional language . 
  i thought that was pretty cool , especially considering he did n't just learn breton in school , but spoke it with his parents .

  i live in paris . 
  we have a distinct `` argot '' often called `` titi parisien '' , which is to french what `` cockney '' would be to english i guess . 
  parisian argot is mostly dead , though many of the argot words entered common french vocabulary , though these words are still considered familiar speak . 
  like cockney , there was also a special way of speaking like a lower class parisian , and it usually involved quite a strong nasal sound in the way they speak . 
  this can be heard in old french movies , or in edith piaf for example . 
  i do n't know if you 're giving an ** explanation ** or really ** posing ** the ** question ** , but yeah , after the norman ** invasion ** of britain , the french ( or rather franco-norman ) ** language ** was for a long time the ** language ** of ** nobility ** , and this ** influenced ** english ** vocabulary ** ** significantly ** . 
  ( words in bold in this ** comment ** are words which i 'm guessing are ** derived ** from french ), 
  normans by 1066 were a mix of the franco-gallic indigenous populations and the francisized vikings . 
  the latter were much less numerous . 
  according to your logic , everything france did is actually credit to the romans who did have colonies and bred with locals throughout gaul . 
  `` gaul are gallo-romans and so , technically romans . 
  romans won the battle of verdun . '', 
  maybe if we maintain a massive canal to rotterdam it would still survive as an inland port . 
  it is indeed cheaper and faster to transport things by water , so it would make sense to have those canals in place . 
   i managed to get out of it and on the road man , i gave up after 5 minutes :d, 
  50 km is n't bad at all . 
  when i was a kid my father took me to visit loire valley castles a lot , so i instantly recognised it had to be one of them , and i got pretty close too , but i assumed it would be much harder for foreigners to even recognise it 's a loire castle . 
   western nations in general have a habit of bringing misery and destruction to others when we give ourselves lots of guns oh please , your comment was doing fine until you decided to add this ridiculousness . 
  i say we let everyone who wants in ( according to my calculations , that would account to over a billion people ) . 
  we 'd be bred out in a generation , but maybe we can have little `` reservations '' for the native populations , and they can have their cute little political council and stuff . 
  does `` tech '' mean exclusively phones ? 
  because otherwise there are many other high tech european companies .

  many socialists have been pressuring him for months ( not to run again ) , many have been vocal about it . 
  the consensus amongst them is that prime minister manuel valls should be running instead of hollande . 
  it is clear that valls has this ambition ( but a ) he does n't want to `` betray '' him , it would look bad for him , b ) he knows his chances are not that much better than hollande 's , so he may be thinking it 's best for him to wait a few years ) . 
  i ca n't help thinking a `` plot twist '' may be under way ( maybe hollande refusing to take part in the primary , even if it would , on paper , look extremely bad . 
  i do n't know , i feel like he 's capable of doing something like that . 
  or valls announcing his candidacy too , which would look pretty bad as well - the president and his pm becoming opponents - but , i do n't know , who knows what 's happening inside the party , there are a lot of people pressuring one another ) . 
  ( edit : in an interview today , pm manuel valls said he 's `` getting prepared '' , whatever that means : pressuring hollande once again so that he drops out and lets him - valls - represent the government in the primary ... or maybe it means he 'll be announcing a candidacy even later than that ... once hollande loses bigly in january and that a leftist wins the primary . ), 
  ( and yes : apart from hollande , there are already several declared candidates for this primary : 9 already - some may drop out , others may join the race ) . 
  - ** terrorist attack foiled . 
  ** 7 men were arrested last weekend in strasbourg ( north ) and marseille ( south ) . 
  5 are still in custody . 
  they were planning an imminent attack ( or several coordinated attacks ? ), 
  in paris ( planned for next thursday ) . 
  one is moroccan , living in portugal , where he was identified as radicalized ( was arrested in marseille ) . 
  investigations so far have shown that he did not have direct contact with the 4 others , but they all were in contact with a french-speaking man giving orders from syria or iraq . 
  the 4 others are french and childhood friends living in strasbourg . 
  their profiles are ` troubling ' : they are older than the other recent terrorists we 've seen ( in their thirties ) , they were unknown from the intelligent services , even though 2 of them went to turkey in 2015 - and may well have crossed the border with syria . 
  ( they flew to cyprus and then reached turkey by boat , whereas other jihadists apparently fly or drive directly to istambul , and are under the radar of the intelligent services . 
  they only stayed a few days ... supposedly to meet this isis guy operating online ? ) . 
  only 2 had a police record and the news about their arrests surprised their colleagues/realtives ( i know we always read this , but it seems that for these guys it 's particularly true : their radicalization really was a shock to everyone , 1 even worked in a primary school where everyone apparently liked him . . but he 's one of the 2 who went to turkey and evidence of allegiance to isis was found in his home ) . 
  apparently , this group was somehow linked ( financially ? ), 
  to another group of jihadists arrested in june ( just before the uefa euro competition ) . 
  no clear `` target '' has been identified , or more specifically , investigations have shown that they used google maps to research about 20 parisians touristic sites ( disneyland , religious monuments , the champs elys\u00e9es , the headquarters of the intelligence services , etc. . ) -------------------------------------------------------------------- - ** a woman was stabbed to death in a retirement home for monks ** you 've probably heard about it . 
  so it was not a terrorist attack after all . 
  the man has been arrested and apparently confessed , but he still has n't explained what his motivations were . 
  he did work at the retirement 10 years ago and knew the victim . 
  he 's been described as a solitary man who spends his time playing video games and who is depressed ... ( he has 2 kids ) . 
  - ** a couple was judged for killing a 5 year-old little girl in 2013 . 
  ** in 2013 , a woman claimed that her 5 year-old daughter fiona went missing ( was kidnapped ) while she fell asleep in a park . 
  she later confessed to lying and admitted the girl had died . 
  her and the step dad admitted they were drug addicts and the child had died from an `` accident '' at home that they tried to cover up . 
  they said they buried her body in the woods but it was never found ( they claim they ca n't remember the exact location ) . 
  after 10 days of trial , the advocate general pleaded for a 30 years sentence for both . 
  the jury opted ( to everyone 's surprise ) for 20 years for the step dad ( who they consider to be the murderer ) and only 5 years for the mother ( only culprit in their eyes of failure to provide assistance to a person in danger ) . 
  an appeal has been made , there will be another trial . 
  - ** british photographer david hamilton was found dead yesterday ( after a probable suicide ) . 
  4 women had accused him of rape earlier this month . 
  ** tv and radio presenter flavie flament published a book a few weeks ago in which she revealed being raped by an internationally famous photographer when she was 13 . 
  quickly hamilton 's name was printed in the media . 
  he denied the accusations and threatened to sue . 
  3 other former models contacted flavie flament with very similar stories of being raped when they were about 13 . 
  his body was found in his paris apartment yesterday . 
  ( the limit is 20 years after the victim 's majority , so i think it was too late for all these women ) . 
  - ** conservative mayors have banned aids campaign posters to `` protect the children '' . 
  ** [ 2 men not even kissing ] ( http://www.breizh-info.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/sexe_hommes_touraine.jpg ) , what will we tell our kids ?!, 
  blah , blah , blah . 
  i 'm tired of this shit . 
  but you know , muslims are the only problem in france ( says fran\u00e7ois fillon , who is counting on the - mostly catholics - anti-gay marriage protesters to win the primary and the presidency ) . 
  you 're welcome !, 
  yes , i 've always been part of those who said that she ( marine le pen ) might actually win the presidency , contrary to what most people say . 
  however , seeing the result of tonight 's primary , i think it will be harder for her : fran\u00e7ois fillon has this image of a serious and responsable man . 
  i think most electors will not hesitate to vote for him to counter the national front ( even if i wo n't be part of those electors : i 'll be voting blank ... unless of course a left-wing candidate i like magically manages to reach the second round ) . 
  whereas if it had been sarkozy : a lot of electors from all tendencies would n't have voted for him and if it had been jupp\u00e9 : a substancial number of right-wing voters would probably have voted for mlp or opted for the blank vote ( i think ) . 
  ** france ** politics : - ** today is the first round of the centre-right presidential primary ** : fillon , jupp\u00e9 and sarkozy are really close in the polls . 
  _____________________________________________________________ ** edit : francois fillon and alain juppe won , sarkozy is out . 
  ** ( details of the results - not definitive yet , but the outcome wo n't change : fillon = 44,1 % ; jupp\u00e9 = 28,2 % ; sarkozy = 21 % ; nkm = 2,5 % ; blm = 2,5 % ; poisson = 1,4 % : cop\u00e9 = 0,3 % ) . 
  voters : close to 4 millions . 
  ______________________________________________________________ ** the winner of this primary is likely to be our next president ** ( * at this stage * : obviously many things can happen in the next 6 months , but he 's likely to be opposed to marine le pen - of the national front - in may and to win the election ) . 
  ** the second round will be next sunday ** : people will decide between the two candidates leading tonight . 
  ** during most of the campaign , alain jupp\u00e9 was leading pretty favorably in the polls but things changed this week : now he , fran\u00e7ois fillon and nicolas sarkozy are all credited of about 30 % ** of the voting intentions ( with fillon leading by 1 % , which was the surprise of the week ) . 
  so , there are 7 candidates : - fran\u00e7ois fillon : former prime minister , under sarkozy . 
  his program is the most liberal one . 
  he saw a late surge in the polls this week , apparently because people consider he 's the most serious one , who knows his shit and prepared well . 
  he led a very right-leaning campaign , centered around `` identity '' , immigration and security issues . 
  he is the favourite amongst `` les r\u00e9publicains '' members ( but they are n't the only ones voting ) . 
  - alain jupp\u00e9 : former prime minister under chirac . 
  he campaigned as a unifying figure and refused to take part in the fear-mongering tendencies of his party . 
  he is the oldest ( 71 ) . 
  if many non-right-wing electors decide to vote ( to counter sarkozy ) , he has a chance . 
  - bruno le maire : former agriculture minister under sarkozy . 
  he is younger and campaigned on the idea of renewing the political landscape , but he did n't succeed : he suffers from a technocratic , `` scholarly '' image and was n't very good during the debates . 
  - nathalie kosciusko-morizet : former environment minister under sarkozy . 
  she 's the only woman in this primary and also the youngest candidate . 
  according to many people , she 's the one with the most modern approach ( but imo she really was n't that good during the debates ) . 
  - jean-fran\u00e7ois cop\u00e9 : the last one in the polls . 
  he never had a chance , everybody hates him . 
  - jean-fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric poisson : candidate for the christian democratic party ( all the others are affiliated with the main right-wing party `` les r\u00e9publicains '' ) . 
  he 's against gay marriage . 
  ( i thought he was really quite good during the debates , even though i do n't like his ideas ) . 
  all things considered , ** there are n't a lot of differences in their programs ** : they are all * very * liberal economically and the very right-leaning tendency on social issues contaminated the whole party . 
  ** electors are probably going to decide based on the candidates ' personalities ** . 
  ** it 's the first time a primary is organized by the conservative party , which means it is difficult to predict how many voters will turn up ** . 
  according to the `` experts '' , if the number is small it will be good for sarkozy ( since it will mean the most hard-core members of the `` les r\u00e9publicains '' party will decide ) . 
  if more people take part , then it will be favorable to jupp\u00e9 or fillon . 
  left-wing electors are tempted to participate , since things are looking very bad for the left in may ( which means they feel encouraged/entitled/tempted to vote in this primary , since at this stage it looks like it will basically decide already who will be our next president ) . 
  difficult to predict : the 3 televised debates were quite successful - more than 5 million people following the 1st and last one . 
  ( one important aspect is the weather : it 's not good today , so maybe people wo n't bother going out ) . 
  final point : in november 2012 , the `` ump '' party had an election to choose its president . 
  it resulted in a major crisis because of the fraud ( it was hilarious : the 2 candidates - fillon and cop\u00e9 - appeared on tv around midnight , both claiming to have won ) . 
  obviously they all know a second similar episode would be disastrous but there 's a possiblity it would happen again . 
  - ** a french-lebanese businessman said this week that he delivered three suitcases from libya , containing 5 million euros in cash , to sarkozy and his former chief of staff and campaign director , in illegal campaign financing from libyan dictator muammar gaddafi , in 2006 and 2007 ** . 
  ( serious ) online investigation newspaper m\u00e9diapart has been covering this story since 2012 . 
  they published new details about the investigation ( launched in 2013 ) last months and evidence is starting to really accumulate . 
  but the mainstream media is barely covering it , arguing that at this point it 's not enough . 
  - ** emmanuel macron ( finally ) announced his candidacy for next year 's presidential election ** . 
  he 's young and very well liked by the media , but this candidacy was heavily criticized . 
  he still has n't announced what his program is !, 
  there is still nothing substancial on his website : he runs on the idea of being a young modern new type of politician , neither right-wing nor left-wing , a progressive who wants to modernize the political system . 
  he was unknown 2 years ago and , after being hollande 's adviser , he was appointed minister of the economy before he `` betrayed '' him this summer when he resigned to launch an individual bid . 
  when regularly interviewed by a `` the daily show '' type of journalist last year , he appeared very modern , in sharp contrast with other politicians ( think obama : he was * a bit * like that in the way he answered ) .

  i really do n't see what 's not to support about implementing a tobin tax , whether it is within the country or at a european level : for once , it 's not an overwhelming tax on the middle-class , but one that targets people who are already doing their best to avoid taxes and funnel money out of our countries to fiscal harbors . 
  which explains in no way why it would harm all of london . 
  how does a high tax harm a city , especially if it 's well redistributed by the government ? 
  if it is n't , the problem is corruption and poor administration , not the tax itself . 
  if it takes too much money from the firms in the city , then it should be normal for the people working there , who already make millions , to reduce their wages and save their companies . 
  i 'm willing to read an explanation , not a simplified statement . 
  i 'm no financial mogul or business student , throwing a sentence like that without any sort of demonstration does n't help the discussion since i ca n't guess why applying a 0.1 % tax on trade margins would `` harm london '', 
  according to human rights watch though , the ceasefire still holds, 
  whether the tobin tax is applied to the wholesale price of a transaction or its margin alone , it does n't change the fact that the people making these trades are already part of the higher upper class that can wipe their shoes on your face and get away with it . 
  yes , it would probably harm london because the top executives and shareholders will keep getting the same insane bonuses that are counted in millions instead of , you know , reducing their wages just a bit and resist the losses suffered by their firms, 
  so the people applying it are dishonest . 
  seems to me it 's like a tax collector who keeps some of the money on the side , the problem there would n't be with the law itself but with poor enforcement and corruption . 
  maybe i understood that wrong , it 's not like i know a lot about finances . 
  i 'm pretty sure that if the traders and bankers there decided to scale down their wages by a few hundred thousands they 'd be alright . 
  they make millions already what 's 0.1 % to them ? 
  probably because the tories have lots of buddies from the city, 
  please . 
  the tobin tax in the eu is at 0.1 % . 
  we 're talking about the city of london , one of the biggest financial centers in the world , the guys working there probably shit in gold-plated toilets . 
  moreover , a lot of money raised by the eu tobin tax is to go back to the uk government because it is home to the city . 
  this is entirely in the government 's advantage, 
  what 's wrong with the tobin tax ? 
  i 'm sure you can find a few federalists in the uk , it would certainly be at the scots or welsh 's advantage, 
  oil , man . 
  norway has oil, 
  yeah but the war in ex-yugoslavia showed there was still potential for war in europe even after world war ii . 
  same goes for the ira and violent secessionist groups . 
  the countries that avoided conflict are either in nato or the eu . 
  well i think most of the us coalition is also unhappy with the guys who are bombing the best fighting force against is on the ground, 
  soon \u00dcberkanzlerin merkel will surpass all these pretenders, 
  i guess climate change denier nigel farage is a much better alternative, 
  alright i 'll shut up, 
  check source remember rt is pro-russian remember the national front is financed by kremlin controlled banks, 
  that 's completely false . 
  any government can enact these measures , and security reforms are not reserved to extreme right wing politicians . 
  the current socialist government is proving right now that they can take a very harsh stance on security measures despite the fn having only two members in the assembly . 
  you may say it 's because they want to attract votes from the right-wing electorate and cut their chances at using these arguments to join a mainstream opposition rhetoric , but the facts remain : the emergency state , intensification of bombing and currently debated reforms are all the result of government proposals . 
  . . capital city of europe ? 
  we made it boyzzzz, 
  france is a un security council member , and the israel-palestine conflict is a top subject in the united nations . 
  also , it is highly doubtful that this move is just random . 
  us officials were probably warned of the plan beforehand and it works just as much in their advantage . 
  they want to see a resolution to the conflict just as much as europeans do , except that recognizing palestine is much more complicated for them considering that there 's an election coming in the year ( no one would really want to anger the jewish lobby right now ) . 
  it puts international pressure from a western nation to renew negotiations while preserving the american position . 
  as i see , many expert diplomats on reddit have come to the conclusion that the palestinians will just obviously try to sabotage negotiations on the basis of ... 
  i do n't know , for obviously they know more than me , and know more than the people working in diplomacy for their livelihoods, 
  both sides may be bad , but one has us-made ballistic cruise missiles that can go three apartment buildings , super modern tanks , and a stable modern economy . 
  and guess what , it 's this side that 's colonizing a land that is not theirs . 
  if they did n't use that kind of threat no one would take them seriously since the us would just wave it off . 
  here there 's at least some chance that the media takes this story to make it a subject for a week or so, 
  no they ca n't . 
  when refugees in the middle east relocate to other middle eastern countries it creates a brand new pool of support some parties or organizations may take advantage of . 
  after the king of jordan sent palestinians away ( because they were already stirring trouble ) , they moved to lebanon where this new muslim population tipped the balance between the many communities there , thus triggering the israeli operation peace in the levant that ended up with massacres of refugee camps , etc. 
  however , in europe the only groups that may try to use them for shady political objectives are islamists , who have no legal authority and are already in the scope of emergency states and peacekeeping forces , and they will never constitute a significant or threatening part of a population of more than 500 million, 
  north korea 's army is made of plastic tho, 
  it wo n't destroy the eu , way too many financial , strategic and political interests among the eurozone and european countries lie in the safeguarding if the union . 
  you may talk to me about the national front in france or other eurosceptics , but if any of them accepted the full picture of their countries ' foreign interests they would support the eu . 
  if the uk can decide to get out of the eu , it sure means scotland can decide to get out of the uk as well , just as the catalans want to secede from spain . 
  a brexit is at no one 's advantage , except european federalists who will get much less opposition to political integration, 
  literally wat, 
  everything is working as planned . 
  you shall thank us later when the mighty united europe under our enlightened rule will be the emerging dominant power as the americans and chinese self-destroy in their competitive struggle, 
  it 's just as arrogant from you to assume there is an all time rule that in all cases chaos would ensue . 
  there is no absolute truth in politics or foreign relations . 
  france lost a hundred thousand soldiers in three weeks after the ardennes breakthrough , defended the dunkirk harbor ardently to allow british troops to retreat to england ( coz yeah the fled pretty quickly too ) . 
  before that , the anglo-french forces in belgium and norway had been kicking the wehrmacht 's ass for a few months . 
  if that 's not putting up a big fight i do n't know what is . 
  france surrendered after paris had been captured , what else could they do keep fighting as most of their armies had been destroyed , trapped or captured ? 
  when its capital was already in enemy hands ? 
  france put up a fight and lost , the army and navy 's soldiers were ready to fight and displayed huge loyalty later when they scuttled their own fleet at toulon as they learned the admirals were ready to give the ships to germany . 
  luckily we were counted among winners thanks to de gaulle , and most of the world war 2 french lore is about the resistance , but france fought hard in the first months of the war , it 's just that the germans completely outmaneuvered outdated french officers . 
  that 's false . 
  the vichy government actually ordered the rafle du vel d'hiv on its own without instruction from germany . 
  they wanted to show some kind of good will to hitler and were more than ready to send jews to the camps . 
  it 's actually low ranking gendarmes and policemen who warned jew families to flee before they were gathered , and italian soldiers - who defended them from french police officers - occupying some french cities in the south as mussolini was forced to let italian jews be taken only after the wehrmacht was deployed in italy after the sicily landings because the italian fascists were n't particularly antisemitic themselves . 
  edit : forgot to complete a sentence earlier , i was high, 
  it 's not defeatism it 's the rule of law . 
  welcome to western society , where we do n't stray away from due process when it 's convenient . 
  france has to at least pretend to uphold the human rights it defined in the drmc . 
  we ca n't go say `` fuck this human rights bullshit '' when at the same time we say we are the country of human rights . 
  but they wo n't say where they 're from . 
  we ca n't just drop them on the libyan coast and wish them good luck, 
  someone here clearly does n't understand second degree humor here, 
  haha and people in france still want to abandon our nuclear facilities, 
  the greatest text ever written in the history of the universe , the declaration of rights of man and citizen , said that distinction between people ought to be only based on general good, 
  i do n't see color , i see proud frenchwomen and frenchmen !, 
  racists, 
  they 're just saying that the a400m is not optimal , not what they 're going to use it for . 
  they 're buying more and more weapons but are not saying what for , that 's the issue . 
  if you speak french and want to work in the environment energy sector you should go to the south . 
  i would greatly advise against going to paris it 's way too expensive . 
  berlin and brussels are also booming affordable cities . 
  nice, 
  that 's a big order . 
  i 'm really wondering if they 're gearing up for bigger operations it 's annoying that the french government is so discrete about its foreign policy there 's so much public money going there we should be told more . 
  they will have both, 
  well if you 're from norway the refugees imposed on the eu countries does not concern you . 
  in fact my comment on anti-refugee haters in the eu would n't even include your country . 
  and i will keep saying that we do have a responsibility to take war refugees as simple human beings . 
  our daily first world problems consist of getting late at work and being too lazy to go buy groceries .

  i thought you were extremelly fair in asking what my actual opinion was instead of going on a rant and assuming what my opinion is like it happens all too often on reddit . 
  this creates a spiral of shit slinging that we kinda see often and that is very time and nerve consumming . 
  it 's a shame more discussions can not be constructive because here a lot of people come from so many different backgrounds and countries and one can learn a lot . 
  you 're comparing a bunch of people throwing fists with a fucking terrorist attack . 
  that 's beyond dumb . 
  move on because i 'll start ignoring you . 
   if you can \u00b4 t prevent brawls inside stadiums , there is no guarantee you can prevent terrorist attacks . 
  i had enough patience with you , but honestly you can go pound sand . 
  i 'm fucking tired of disgusting pricks that can not wait for terrorist attacks . 
  look 50 people dead in orlando . 
  go rub one off thinking about that . 
  the bulgarians should have qualified for the euro . 
  btw this is n't a joke . 
  these are n't exactly private beaches . 
  restaurants rent a part of it from the local community and put some tables and what have you . 
  but you are free to walk on the sea front . 
  no one will tell you anything . 
  so it 's not like they 're closed off or anything . 
  the sea front is all public access in nice . 
  the french police stopped arresting . 
  see the huge protests against the reforms concerning work conditions . 
  you 'd have big big scuffles with the police and only 10-15 arrests at most . 
  maybe because the prisons are already overloaded . 
  arrest 400 people , then you have to try them etc etc. 
  for what ? 
  breaking 5 store windows and burning a bar ? 
  considering that the most resources need to be focused at the terrorism threat . 
  ( hence why your : put undercover cops where you have 20 locals is pure stupidity ) . 
  a brawl is inconvenient . 
  a terrorist attack is a massive disaster . 
   is it that hard for you to admit that the russians are in the wrong too ? 
  the russians are much more in the wrong on the stadium . 
  in nice it 's apparent that a group of 20 locals were being stupid . 
  in marseille outside the stadium who did what i do n't know since i was n't there . 
  all 3 parts were involved . 
  russians , english and french locals . 
  concerning the french police they are hands off until shit hits the fan and that 's when they go in baton in hand ready to dish out some woopass . 
  the thing is that common narrative seems to be the english were minding their own business . 
  and they got viciously attacked by the french locals then by the police then by russians . 
  this forces a more defensive attitude on my part . 
  i honestly believe the battle between the english and the locals was because both parties were idiots . 
  ( the marseillians because they 're dumb by definition and the english because who the fuck chants about isis , they were being provocative ) . 
  concerning the russians they were by far the most violent ( the brit with his head bashed in ) . 
  and on the stadium of course . 
  if a russian or marseillian or a nicois would come and play they innocent card i 'd be just as dismissive . 
  yes !, 
   i am just going to quote that . 
  good , you learnt something, 
   but still in order to whitewash your country y again ... did you bother reading the comment i replied to ? 
  like take a moment and do it . 
  why do you think i mentioned poland 2012 ? 
  for shits and giggles !, 
  the guy was trying to pretend poland went without a problem and france is utter mayhem . 
  yeah but at least we won a euro  . 
  we won two actually . 
  you should try it man ... it feels nice :d if you can manage to not get a goal at the first kick that is in direction of the goal post . 
  hence the `` self respecting country '' comment   that gives catholic church power of granting state marriage . 
  be that as it may ( even though it 's supremely weird , if you 're religious , you should have your own separate , special and pointless ceremony in your church ) the fact of the matter still remains : civil servants can still perform civil marriages . 
  and that 's what the whole gay marriage is about . 
  there is about 0 gays that want a priest to be forced to marry them . 
   you can put undercover cops around fans ** it 's 20 locals ** . 
  how the hell do you put an undercover cop under 20 locals that know the area to perfection ? 
   a lot of this football violence is agent provocateurs ( a french concept by the way )  ) fuck me you 're salty . 
  provocateurs a french concept . 
  that 's rich . 
  what next ? 
  beef is also a french concept ? 
  and pork ? 
   you can do things like forbidding the sale of drinks fuck that . 
  i wo n't drink my wine in plastic bottles because some idiots wan na see a bunch of rich retards hit a ball . 
   it \u00b4 s weird , in euro 2012 there were all these doomsday predictions about violent ultras and racism and bad planning , but ** it went out fine ** http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/competitions/euro-2012/9328626/euro-2012-poland-sports-minister-ashamed-as-polish-and-russian-hooligans-cause-violence-on-warsaw-streets.html 154 polish arrested , 24 russians . 
  that 's fine for you ? 
   and it \u00b4 s only day 3 . 
  it happened 4 days after the start ... https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=mo3qzd1cln0 dude go troll sole other place cuz you 're boring . 
  ca n't even google . 
  geesh . 
  salt ? 
  his comment is brilliant  ), 
   there is also the issue of how fair the versailles treaty was . 
  it is often stated that it 's harsh terms brought germany to financial ruin , opening the path to power for hitler . 
  define fairness ? 
  is splitting germany in two ( actually more ) parts with one under a oppressive communist regime that was under full control of moscow a fairer deal than versailles ? 
  besides a control of the ruhr mines between 23-25 , i fault to see what massive unfair treatment germany got . 
  let 's not forget how brutal ww1 . 
   i find it distastful when gay rights movements are trying to strong arm the church into marrying them through legistlation . 
  holy shit . 
  this has got to be the single most ignorant comment i read this week on reddit . 
  there are about 0 gay people that wan na force any big religious institution to marry them . 
  you can not be so ignorant as to think `` marriage = religious ceremony happening in the church '' , right ? 
  cuz the religious ceremony in any normal self respecting society has ** zero ** value to the state . 
  wow , i am saving our comment . 
  someone that believes gay marriage means telling the pope that he should make religious ceremonies for the gays . 
  i did n't think people like you existed . 
  :d darn you are a good laugh . 
  i 'm saving your comment . 
  some context http://www.nicematin.com/faits-divers/videos-violents-affrontements-dans-le-vieux-nice-apres-angleterre-russie-56524 the nirish were drinking in an irish pub . 
  about 20 locals showed up . 
  they started singing . 
  a bottle was thrown apparently at the irish and then bottles started flying around . 
  it 's not exactly ww2 ,

  what famous composers from the classical and romantic era does turkey have ? 
  sure sure we can find exceptions ( bosnia is muslim , hungariand , finnish are not indo-european ) but only small exceptions . 
  with a population of 75 million and with a history like turkey 's , it is simply to big to count is as an exception . 
  therefore it is not european . 
   that akp is very good at the manipulation of rural voters ? 
  70 % of turkish are urbaners . 
  so 30 % of the votes got 53 % if the parlament ? 
  i wo n't buy that ...  . 
  wonder , what are your thoughts on australians , now abbott is the pm ? 
  abbott is no longer pm ... but australia is one of the highest poluters in the world . 
  if you dont want alcoholism , educate your people . 
  not rise taxes to impossible levels . 
  53 voted for the sultan 's party . 
  let 's stop pretending . 
  that 's gut wrenching . 
  well drinking is forbidden in islam . 
  if that 's what the turkish want , that 's what the turkish want . 
  \u00af \\ _ ( \u30c4 ) _ / \u00af i just hope people will now stop the turkey is a european country bs . 
  how many people are in critical condition expected to not really make it ? 
   nothing like giving more money too the church i doubt the church has a monopoly on shitty candles . 
  these look like the cheap one made in china or wherever . 
  whats the threshold to change the constitution ? 
  and darn 10 % to get in the parlament , that 's high, 
   but just uses it in american context ( he is addressing americans after all ) . 
  so americans have their own vocabulary . 
  what 's so amazing about that ? 
  it 's simply dumb to correct people on their own vocabulary . 
   and if you go over to / r/socialism and ask the americans there the point is to go to / r/usa and ask americans what socialism is . 
   . but sanders is obviously trying to recuperate the word . 
  and that 's a valid linguistic process . 
  languages evolve like it or not . 
  it 's like telling americans they shouldnt call football , soccer . 
  and they should n't call gridiron , football . 
  or call it foot-long ball . 
  it 's pointless . 
  people understand what sanders means . 
   . that is in fact the precise , correct definition , that if you look up reputable dictionaries and encylopedias , that 's what it says . 
  yes and ? 
  i 'm simply saying that people understand what sanders means . 
  and you can not call him incorrect because vocabulary and languages evolve . 
  yes , you do n't get to correct me on my french and i dont get to correct you on your dutch . 
  he was channeling his inner american . 
  so sanders thinks that in denmark and other countries workers own the means of production ? 
  til . 
  rasmunssen  the nordic model is an expanded welfare state which provides a high level of security to its citizens social democracy :  social democracy thus aims to create the conditions for capitalism to lead to greater egalitarian , democratic and solidaristic outcomes , and is often associated with the set of socioeconomic policies that became prominent in western and northern europe - particularly in the nordic countries - during the latter half of the 20th century . 
  well rasmussen isnt a native english speaking american , so i fear he 's in the wrong correcting people in their own language and vocabulary . 
  actually what americans call socialism is `` really '' called social democracy . 
  the english language being still a living language , words can change meaning . 
  we need not be so strict . 
  it is fairly clear what americans or bs mean when they say northern europe is socialist . 
  and the ~ ~ company ~ ~ country will be called saudi arabia . 
   how dare you say banks are super . 
  when i wanted to buy a house and asked the bank for money you do not understand the difference between commercial bank and investment bank . 
   , why would n't they just give me the money since they have so much ? 
  in 2006 if you were living on minimum wage in the states , you 'd get a moan immediatly to buy a house . 
  it was an awesome time . 
   . do you know they also lend money to poor people who want to start a business ? 
  again , do you think cameron wants to protect your right to get a loan from a bank ? 
  what flavour is that kool aid you 're drinking ? 
   i do n't think banning smoking would have made a difference . 
  still , time to get in line with the rest of the world . 
  i remember an article saying google refuses 75 % of take down requests based on right to be forgotten . 
  so it 's not exactly a fully censorship tool . 
  it 's not like the powers than be do n't have the power to remove the access to relevant information if so they choose to . 
   nigger head it 's actually negro head not nigger head . 
   so when europe tries to pin all of the racism on america ... racism in europe vs racism in the us are different due to divergent history . 
  hence why negro has a different meaning here vs there . 
   a lot of people , especially older ones are not educated enough when it comes to `` political corerectness '' today . 
  you dont need to be pc to know not to say in the bus : look a black person . 
   the universal declaration of human rights so do the catholics . 
  in general religious people are short minded . 
   instead of discussing the means to achieve a society more homogeneous in culture but who wants that ? 
  france already tried doing that and it only alienated others like basques , corsicans and the bretons . 
  people are kinda tired to be told what being french means or is . 
   eric zemmour what solution has he proposed ? 
  besides certain hints that the arabs should be eliminated from society . 
  he has no solution and he is simple * obsessed * with the arabs . 
  and even his former supporters and friends have started to criticise him more and more : ruquier and more notably naulleau . 
   michel onfray or alain finkielkraut like i 've said a few times . 
  the rise of marine le pen has one very positive side . 
  she has shown that the french intellectual , an old concept , has lived its life . 
  they are no longer relevant . 
  with so many sources of information and ideas , we no longer need some old dude telling us what to think . 
  these guys have no ideas and no moral goals . 
  their goal is to sell books . 
  they ca n't even come close to the likes of valery , camus or sartre . 
   did you know that it is forbidden for muslims to change religion ? 
  tell that to my atheist friends that have muslim parents . 
  dude have you met any muslims or are you talking about saudi arabian ones ? 
   and that if your parents are muslim you are de facto a muslim ( for life ) ? 
  same goes for christians . 
  and if you dont baptise you go to hell or purgatory or who gives a shit . 
  honestly dude ... 
   yeah the muslim majority countries make the earth great !, 
  sharia is the proper law . 
  women and non-muslims should be second class citizens . 
  how many of your friends are muslims ? 
  because literally none of my friends believe that . 
  yeah none . 
   looking at the societal impact of immigration , talking about islam .

  trianon is a beautiful [ palace ] ( http://www.all-free-photos.com/images/panoramiques/pa0114-hr.jpg ) . 
  if people wan na think about it , i see no problem . 
  that 's because everybody knows that gravity points north towards south . 
  / r/nottheonion what does this say about the fact that they used different slabs instead one big one ? 
  brilliant strategy . 
  no one would argue that teenagers should be allowed to sext . 
  that 'd be political suicide . 
  and that 's how they move the window of what 's allowed and what 's not . 
  yeah . 
  if you wan na off yourself , go at it buddy . 
  who are we to decide what 's what , amirite ? 
   suicides often harm family in more ways than just emotionally . 
  by your comment , that worse harm seems to be train delays . 
   as it 's sort of a historical reminder of the previous labells israel has all my sympathy . 
  amazing country with amazing people . 
  and it is a forever embarrassment what happened to french citizens during that period . 
  the nation of israel is our friend ( invaded egypt together , the israeli nuclear project happened bacause france helped a great deal ) . 
  but a true friend is one that does not fear telling you when you 're acting like a douche . 
  and with the occupied territories , israel is acting like a douche . 
  i understand part of the reasons , it 's impossible not to , but sometimes you got ta take the higher road . 
  i 'd support similar labellings for crimea for example . 
   because this is discriminating nobody would dare discriminate against jewish colonialists, 
  * blinks twice *, 
   more information would allow antisemitic consumers anti-semitic would mean they wo n't buy jewish at all . 
  so your point does n't stand . 
   boycotting nobody is boycotting anything . 
  we simply have more information . 
  do you oppose the consumer having more information ? 
  why ? 
  easy . 
  try making shirts with the work nike on them . 
  tell us the results . 
  they 're not made in israel so they should be labeled as such . 
  but bombing assad would just like in libya ? 
   i would personally vote against this kind of thing if i were an mp . 
  ultimately it strikes me as illiberal to tell people what they can or can not wear . 
  i also think that it will have negative consequences ( more women staying at home , police time being wasted ) . 
  in france those people that could not live without wearing a niqab decided to move to countries where they can ( maghreb ) . 
  so win win for everybody . 
  i get to live in the society that i wan na live in , they get to live in the society they wan na live in . 
   thats exactly what it is . 
  god i hate international media covering national topics . 
  welkom into my world !, 
   and even under that projection france would have a significantly lower gdp than germany . 
  let me explain to you how percentages work . 
  the difference between the german economy and the french economy will remain 1 trillion through out this period * but * both economies will significantly increase . 
  do you understand how that means france will catch up to germany ? 
   so what makes that not solid growth then ? 
  if being surpassed by uk and caught up by france slowly but surely floats your boat i see no problem with it . 
   because that is not the reality we live in . 
  that 's the reality surrounding countries live in . 
  http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/economics/11401466/how-the-world-will-look-in-2050.html by 2050 we 'll have the same population as germany . 
   we are closing in on full employment in germany with growth going solid , 1.5 % is not solid growth . 
  if you 'd have normal birth rates , you 'd actually have increasing unemployment , which you do n't see because far fewer people enter the market in germany than leave . 
   my personal view is that only an orderly dissolution of the euro can avert the big blowout . 
  that will cost , a lot , but it 's better to have a horrific end than endless horror . 
  attitudes and cultures are just too divergent in this area to allow for a common currency because neither side is able and willing to swallow the compromises necessary to make it work . 
  that will not happen because that would take guts from any german chancellor and we have yet to see that from one . 
  so the only thing that 'll happen is france becoming italy with a wasted 20 years and electing an fn president which will mean the disolution of the eu ... awesome ... 
   relaunch which machine ? 
  you 're at 0.5 % gdp growth . 
  same for basically all eurozone countries . 
  ** that ** machine . 
   economically solid times and additional revenue is of course spent . 
  germany 's not in economically solid times . 
  germany 's economy will be surpassed if nothing is done by uk and france will reduce the difference between the two . 
  also your [ birth rate is the lowest in the world ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-32929962 ) . 
  all is not fine ... far from it . 
   they have spent too long calling anyone who expresses any kind of euscepticism racists . 
  so being anti-current version of the euro = euscepticism ? 
  i think once more you confuse terms . 
   right now germanys trade within the eu/ez is roughly balanced . 
  well germany needs to relaunch the machine by having massive public spending . 
  and they 're not doing that ... 
   stereotypical fiscally conservative and risk-averse german so who runs db and vw because goddamn it 's the total opposite of fiscal conservative and risk-adverse behaviour . 
   but given that brits ca n't seem to manage french , doubt they 're doing it for native brits , 
   what i find interesting is to look at this conflict in the context of the yugoslav war , with all the horrors in dubrovnik or srebrenica . 
  that did n't happen in 98 though . 
  dubrovnik and srebenica are n't even in kosovo man . 
   so the ukrainians tried to ethnically cleanse russians in crimea ? 
  that 's news to me . 
  is there any proof the serbians engaged in ethnic cleansing in kosovo in 98 ? 
  so people are no longer shocked when news organisations register as political groups . 
  okay ... 
  so as time goes by , they have better eyesight ? 
  really original portrait btw . 
  love the idea . 
  what do you do besides thebords of said country ? 
  no one can start trade wars buddy !, 
   but the results are probabilities that 's why you offer error bars . 
  and most likely 538 assumed that the confidence intervals did n't overlap meaning that something was wrong . 
   their simulations include effects that alter the weighting of these polls , as an example one simulation could include results of florida polls being given little weight because this simulation is assuming demographic changes to the voting populace that the polls are n't representing . 
  http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/a-users-guide-to-fivethirtyeights-2016-general-election-forecast/ nope . 
  they do n't alter it . 
  once they set the values each poll has , that 's it at step 4 . 
  what you 're saying happens at step 1 . 
  they have a ton of variables , it would be nice to know the sensibilities of their models to these variables and that simply is n't being shown . 
   but that according to the information available well that 's the problem right there . 
  garbage in , garbage out . 
  if the collection of data is deeply flawed , the results will be flawed .

  i already translated all the free-speech limitation rules :-p i was not aware of all these limitations and ponder trolling about them ( i feel like cultures should be criticizable ) but well ... 
  * it will go well . 
  no shit sherlock . 
  people with a safety net are more keen to switch jobs , and people who are more mobile usually end up in jobs they like better . 
  and people who end up in jobs they like better are usually more keen to work . 
  a side effect is also that people with safety nets are also more keen to spend , driving growth . 
  if i know that the first medical issue i have can cost me 20 000 euros , i will try to have that on my account at all time . 
  if i know that life-saving operations will be paid for , i can spend more of my savings . 
  they are not part of the euro zone . 
  that makes their problem of a totally different nature . 
  their crisis makes it dangerous to hold huge reserve in their currency ( hryvnia ? ), 
  which is kind of expected for a country at war . 
  winners will have the ability to devaluate the currency later on or even totally change the currency using its own national sovereignty . 
  greece puts uncertainty on the euro itself in a peace situation and requires a solution at the european level . 
  everytime i have a `` this content is not available in your area '' i think that someone is totally failing at this internet thing . 
  to be honest , on day 1 , 2 and 3 i have read a lot about it , and the only certainty that there was , was that it was a military missile that downed the plane and likely a ground-based missile . 
  there was a twitter account linked to pro-separatists which claimed to be the responsible before it was known to be a civilian plane , as well as radio recording of the conversation of people discovering the truth . 
  however , i did not consider it a crazy conspiracy to imagine that both of these could have been fabricated . 
  imo the two best arguments to exclude a ukrainian responsibility were : - that a trained operator always check for civilian transponders before shooting ( and honestly this is a * very * easy procedure ) - that ukrainian army had no reason to deploy such weapons , considering that the separatists do not have an air force . 
  so i always leaned on a separatist responsibility but having a good proof is good . 
  the last cease-fire agreements have a clause offering forgiveness for a whole range of action that implicitly includes this attack . 
  the pope [ approves ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/the-pope/11193681/pope-francis-praises-exorcists-for-combating-the-devils-works.html ) . 
  and remember , it is a modern one . 
  / hug reading on the various religious/atheist subreddits i realize how lucky i am to not have wasted years reversing some religious brainwashing . 
  fr : immigrant and gypsies . 
  the far left focuses more on bankers and the world of finance . 
  depending on the eu calendar , eu can get some blame , especially germany . 
  most french would not call it centre-right either . 
  none were taken by the front national , but seeing how extreme some members of the ump can be , i would not go as far as to say that the extreme right won no department . 
  i would call the ump far-right , but what do i know , i am just a centrist hippie ... 
  internet . 
  making people share ideas . 
  smart people share smart ideas , idiots share idiotic ideas . 
  both atheism and creationism are spreading . 
  catholics will have a hard time being creationists , as the church , more or less , recognizes evolution ( but still has its own brand of intelligent design ) . 
  so it will be mostly protestants , muslims or random nutjobs . 
  i did not expect philippines , malaysia and indonesia to have doubts on the matter , to be honest . 
  and i did not know that south america was so tolerant despite a high religiousity . 
  it has been a long time since i read his m\u00e9moires de guerre but i seem to recall that he at least considered stepping down at this moment and that he was basically unavailable for a few days . 
  i think it is his son who talks about this suicide thing . 
  considering a few other traits that he acquired at the end of the war ( not afraid of death , talking about himself at the third person ) i think it matches fairly well the narrative that he considered himself as well as dead and was not interested in anything else than his mark on history . 
   france and other european nations made proposals to change their privacy/data collection legislation very soon after the ch attack . 
  interestingly , most of the changes were made in a relative indifference two months prior to the attack . 
  after the charlie attacks , there were calls for a `` patriot act \u00e0 la fran\u00e7aise '' which were very coldly received . 
   what are the greeks waiting for then ? 
  probably the last moment , seeing as how the last round has shown that early agreement was a waste of time . 
  the lower left corner makes you understand why de gaulle considered suicide when the whole french navy was lost to germany ... 
   the average engineer does n't know more about governance the average lawyer does not know anything about industry . 
  there is no shortage of poor industrial decisions that were made because of lack of technical oversight and because of a pure financial view of the situation . 
   ( except for ethnic russians returning to russia ) . 
  well they may be more than you believe then . 
  well south korea went better from the point where it kicked the us puppet out . 
  arguably afghanistan is not too bad . 
  iraq war was a very , very poor decision that everyone in the world warned the us against . 
  japan has a capitalist system and very low inequalities . 
  apparently due to the respect of some general ethics . 
  i really wonder if they would not have fared well under communism . 
  oh and the ldp is still in power . 
  there were only 4 years since the 50s where they were not in power . 
  since 2012 they are back in and probably for a pretty long time . 
  i remember when i visit budapest ( not czech republic i know ) for the first time . 
  it felt glorious , like some old parts of paris . 
  you could feel the powerful civilization that was put on hold there . 
  yes , heartbreaking . 
  when i see stats about france ranking in the first ten countries of anything ( # 6 gdp ? 
  seriously ? 
  we have an insignificant population ! ), 
  it somehow feels undeserved . 
  pure luck . 
  it is purely due to our position in europe that we did not end up as a part of ussr . 
  i wish more people realized that when they criticize opening borders with eastern european countries . 
  racist is not really the word , but it comes from the fact that outside public institution or the military , the main groups to proudly display french flags everywhere are far-right xenophobes . 
  it is not a 100 % rule though . 
  in * practice * it is true but we all know that nothing in the french flag implies the rejection of foreigners or racism . 
  so if someone waves a french flag in france , it wo n't be seen automatically as a racist act , but it will trigger question and suspicion . 
  showing your flag * in france * is seen as a xenophobic act , because outside public institutions ( city hall , army facilities , police stations ) a flag is a pretty uncommon sight . 
  the implied message is `` here is france , not < insert disliked country here  '' . 
  i find it a bit sad but that is the perception right now . 
  outside of france , however , it is not really frowned upon . 
  it is a bit similar to showing what your favorite sport team is . 
  every summer , yeah i know ... 
   recent statements by russian ambassador mikhail vanin that danish warships could become the target of russian nukes , should the country participate in nato 's missile defence , have drawn a sharp reaction from nato . 
  actually on this one i do n't see any update on their military doctrine . 
  this is still plain old mad and i am not sure how this is actually news .

  the debate about the waterloo coin is the dumbest thing i have ever heard . 
  of course they should get it !, 
  the funny thing is that this was uk that imposed a national side on the currencies because they wanted that the queen was on their coins . 
  then they finally decided to not join the eurozone . 
  trolling eu like bosses ... 
  i say we should put a guillotine on our one euro coins . 
  amateurs . 
  they are selling ship flags when we are selling flagships to them !, 
  we should really get rid of this consensus rule before enlarging .

  because we 're really bitter . 
  at least i am . 
  the european union speaks the language of its most eurosceptic member , that chose to keep its old money . 
  not that i would be happy that french or german was the de facto european language . 
  something like esperanto would have been more fitting for us . 
  edit : i 'm not that bitter , just a bit sad , and i am in no way hating on british or americans . 
  and the scenarios . 
  thanks , that 's true for canada too . 
  i can explain for canada , i think it 's the same for the us : your employer decides how much of your salary goes to taxes . 
  if your employer paid a bit too much in taxes ( and after taking into account all your deductibles , like charity ) you get money back . 
  if your employer did not pay enough , you 'll have to pay . 
  generally you pay a accountant to fill your taxes . 
  you give him the documents showing how much you got paid that your employer gave you and other documents about your other financial gains , or tax-deductible expenses ( charity , medical and education expenses , etc. ) . 
  he fills the paperwork and tells you how much you can expect to get back/pay . 
  sure , but i do n't see french newspapers bashing uk at every opportunity .

  even small restaurants wo n't stop serving before 8h30 on slow days . 
  i just wonder why british newspaper have so much hate on france . 
  it 's always `` france is bad , look at this new law '' , `` france is going down , look at these numbers '' , `` france is shit , we do n't really know why but let us explain with numerous anecdotes '' . 
  what 's the problem , are they angry because francis bacon ? 
  that 's for uk . 
  in canada ( and the us i guess ) it 's common to eat dinner between 5-6 :30 pm . 
  it 's homicides per 100,000 inhabitants . 
  why not napol\u00e9on ? 
  well the arrest did happen , it was [ filmed ] ( http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x175skg_exclusif-paris-france-13-11-2013-interpellation-de-david-van-hemelryck-leader-de-hollande-demission_news#from=embediframe ) . 
  i find it really funny that he 's followed by a news motorcycle the day he 's arrested . 
  it 's also not said on what grounds he was arrested , you only get to hear what he had to say . 
  what do you mean by `` protestant work ethic '' ? 
  i feel like i 'm missing something . 
  edit : thanks to everyone who answered my question .

  [ artist is from finland , videoclip is french ] ( http://vimeo.com/11986796 ), 
  well everyone knows france is bacon . 
  what part is it ? 
  is it this one ? 
   because one of the effects of having such an ideas-based vision of society , and elevating ideas to such heights , is that people actually start believing in them , and then maybe they start thinking the ideas are worth fighting for , or perhaps dying for , or perhaps even killing for . 
  and then what ? 
  well we 're trying ... ca n't blame the governement for that . 
  first part :  lufthansa just announced it would apply small varnish patches simulating shark skin on two airbus a-340 300 in order to reduce fuel comsuption . 
  i 'm not sure about some of the words . 
  for cheaper you can say `` moins cher '' meaning `` less costly '' or `` less expensive '' . 
  if you really want to use march\u00e9 it would be that way : les choses sont en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral _ meilleur _ march\u00e9 aux usa qu'en europe . 
  but i do n't think i 'm a good teacher . 
  visit / r/french for a better support , 
  i think he means french can give you a lot of nuances in meaning compared to english . 
  maybe it 's a cultural bias ( you have more vocabulary and understanding of your native language than a foreign one ) . 
  not sure if serious, 
  i like you . 
  as far as i remember , the critics were majorly the ump , some industry bosses , and the right-leaning media . 
  yes , we need time to protest . 
  more seriously , norway workers works even less than french ones , yes they have a very sharp productivity advantage . 
  maybe there 's something to learn about that . 
  [ l'internationale ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epgro-tiegm ) , may be french but have been translated to most european languages . 
  how did you call my mom ? 
  no , i meant `` i do n't mind too '' !, 
  i usually do too . 
  they do are europeans . 
  but if you can read french speaking swiss newssites ( like http://www.20min.ch/ro/news/suisse/story/10553175 ) , you 'll see that the comments are mostly about french people living close to the swiss border and crossing the frontier to steal swiss jobs . 
  swiss people do n't seem very friendly to french people . 
  but switzerland is not part of the european union . 
  well i certainly did not know that . 
  thanks . 
  merci . 
  damnit , they were so close to a resolution !, 
  i thougth the longest word was \u00e9lastique :3 i 'll see myself out . 
  my father also had to stop in riga on his way to moscow and loved it !,

  what 's disgusting about racism ? 
  so i 'm not the only one looking at / r/worldnews top comments and leaving disgusted .

  you just have to look at your northern neighbor . 
  they have that too . 
  i do n't know who you met , but i met of people not obsessed with money , whose goal was to teach , study , follow a goal other than the big bucks . 
  [ bourges ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bourges ) is a very old man . 
  he have tons of stories to tell , how he was friend to some ancient hero , but got beaten badly while defending him . 
  he still have some scars from that fight . 
  he also loves to tell about how , in his thirties , he was a seducer and had a great wealth . 
  he still have a beautiful watch from that time . 
  he 's still the boss of a small company , but his neighbours are taking away all his business .

  if they ca n't go to school because they ca n't afford it , if they ca n't do it because they had ~ ~ dissentry ~ ~ a cold and died of it because even tylenol was too costly ; if they ca n't because they ended up homeless one week in loosing their last job ; they would never have created that economy . 
  so , if you really want to `` create jobs '' , you want that money to go to welfare , social security , keeping free schools , unemployment , etc. 
  not giving it to people already very wealthy who do n't need it to actually run their projects and could already borrow to a bank if they needed . 
   the idea is for the government to protect the welfare , basically , yes  the financial health of the state which is dependant on tax collection & cracking down on evasion  and help companies grow and expand annnd not by giving money to them , no . 
  this is not a function people have in mind when they elect a democratic governement actually representing them to some degrees . 
  that 's where neoliberalism come from . 
  they added that idea and use it as an argument to abolish the tax system that maintain 's it health ( and therefore damaging said state ) . 
  on the economic side , the main role of the state is to collect those taxes on most people and redistribute them as welfare in scandinavia . 
  not to give billions in tax breaks and billions in subsidies ( ie budget looting ) they generally get in the us by giving bribes ( oh sorry , `` campaign contributions '' ) to well placed politicians ( and now every politicians nowadays as a result since it 's becoming accepted and common practice ) . 
   ** without state-private sector cooperation sweden would n't be where they are now . 
  ** ** actually , again , no ** : ** in fact , no it 's not the private sector that recovered and saved their economic ** and act as an economic engine . 
  it 's the public one , that 's still nowadays a good 30 % ( 50 % at the time ? ), 
  of employments in sweden : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_public_sector it acts as the real economic engine partly by being a door stopper to the worst private sector excesses , by maintaining low prices & concurrence on some key goods like utilities , and creating a large hiring sector that paid a living no matter what and do n't try to scrounge every last seconds or pennies out of it 's employees . 
  it 's a secure way of garranteeing an income to a major part of the population even when the private sector is too busy not paying anyone a living `` because we have no money '' . 
  if private wage is too low or conditions too shit , in north european countries people can simply quit and work for the public sector instead . 
  and when all companies are shit , they crash in mass but the public sector survive and grow . 
  which is what happened . 
  - it 's also the fact they did n't hesitated to take money from said private sector ( now that it 's growing again after they ended their excesses ) and redistribute it that saved their economy : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/economy_of_sweden  sweden is a competitive mixed economy featuring a generous universal welfare state financed through relatively high income taxes that ensures that income is distributed across the entire society , a model sometimes called the nordic model . 
  the large private sector is needed too obviously , whether for innovation , driving down prices in honest competition ( one that can only exist if there is a concurrent they ca n't sink down by illegal means or dumping , like a state ran company ) , offering similarly competition in the hiring sector ( which again can only exist if there is no monopoly of the private sector like in the us where `` public company '' and `` nationalization '' are synonymous with `` communism '' ) , or filling whatever need the gov did not/could not think of . 
  but , again , regulation against excess is needed and it 's a large public sector , public hirings , public wages and welfare that kind of saved their economy out of nowhere . 
  not trickle down 's `` abolish all your public state run concurrents , let us do whatever we want and we 'll maybe create jobs if you give us billions in breaks and subsides on top of it '' and force people to work for pennies by abolishing unemployment money like some love to push ( so they can then steal it too as `` subsidies '' and `` tax breaks '' ) . 
   true , but this is unrelated to the point we 're talking about . 
  i mean you use finance like the russians use oil . 
  it 's not skill , it 's just luck and exports . 
  and if you void the eu finance regulations after leaving the eu , you could loose access to the eu-linked markets and therefore loose most of your finance base . 
   and 5.3 % were underemployed ( so are working less hours than they would like to ) that 's surprizing or does n't count the zero hours contract . 
  i mean , there 's an entire wikipedia page dedicated to that specific problem that you can read here : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/zero-hour_contract#united_kingdom  eported in august 2013 that as many as 1 million workers in the united kingdom , 3 -- 4 % of the workforce , work under the terms of a zero-hour contract . 
  the zhc ... alone ... is 4 % of the working population in the uk . 
  so , add all the other form of crappy contracts and non zhc small time jobs and you can probably more than triple that statistic . 
  i 'm talking about a potential 15/20 % extreme precarity . 
  now , add the existant unemployment ( 5 % ? 
  ) , rising unemployment ( +5 % in 10 years ? 
  ) , and all the illegal undeclared work ( http://ec.europa.eu/europe2020/pdf/themes/07_undeclared_work_02.pdf ) that make up a good 10 % of the uk 's economy that generally like to consider minimal wage ( already insufficient to live in a big part of the uk ) a set of guidelines more than laws ; and you 're looking at 40 % of the workers not earning a living . 
  to me , combine 40 % of the work age population not earning a living with a systematic welfare and tax dismantling in the name of neoliberalism ; with a huge dash of rising poverty that 'd make the tatcher strikes era proud ; that says `` social trouble '' . 
  but hey , better rig the unemployment & precarity statistics , ignore the problem , keep deregularizing/helping corporations evading taxes and stealing welfare money `` because they do n't deserve it they 're lazy and can just work instead '' , right ? 
  / s then add a financial crash on top if the uk leave and do wtf and decide to ignore regulations and close their own door to our cash flows . 
  sorry , i should have clarified , i meant the turkish governement ; not the entire country 's population, 
   the swedish model does n't work because they tax and redistribute , it works because there is a strong private sector that employs , produces and exports . 
  that 's the usual `` neoliberal '' ( pro `` free market '' ) propaganda that argue that the taxes have nothing to do with it ; because they 'd rather pocket that money and be more wealthy themselves ; even if it kills yet another series of country . 
   focus on welfare before job creation and the result is debt and unemployment . 
  that 's simply not true ; scandinavia having one of the biggest focus on welfare in the world . 
  and the results shows . 
  their society is litterally built on their social safety net . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nordic_model edit : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/welfare_state#effects_of_welfare_on_poverty  sweden 23.7 ( poverty rate before they got their welfare system ) 5.8 ( poverty rate after )  finland 11.9 3.7  france 36.1 9.8 pretty much the proof it 's what removed poverty in their country and therefore kept the demand level enough to keep supply on . 
   the uk already had a flexible labour market based around finance . 
  if finance crash , your entire economy could disappear overnight . 
  there is little diversification . 
   and our unemployment is still at record lows among both natives and foreigners . 
  unemployement being low because a lot of that `` employment '' is zero paid hours garranted contracts or things that do n't allow you to eat . 
  if you get paid 50 # a week for 5h you are out of the `` unemployment '' statistic but your still just as screwed and have to leave london/whatever big town pretty fast and find something else . 
   there are plenty of opportunities and new companies that could be started . 
  well if you have no client because they have no money either , not really . 
  try starting a company in greece for example . 
   but the swedes managed because their social model collect `` high '' ( not really but , existant ) taxes and redistribute them as welfare . 
  while greek welfare was systematically dismantled at absolutely every level ( whether it 's social security , pensions , age of retirement , etc etc ) so that the money could be sent to ( already wealthy ) creditors instead . 
   why do you think it 's so high in france and most of continental europe ? 
  machines do the work of many people at a fraction of the cost . 
  whether it is harvesters vehicules or excel spreadsheets for accounting or assembly lines pumping hundreds of car with a dozen employees ; when it 's not china showing us how to build high end smartphones for less than 15 $ ( the one you buy 200 $ in shops . ), 
  by the millions . 
  we have enough wealth floating around to already feed the population a hundred time ( the european gdp is in dozens of trillions . ), 
  but at some point there simply wo n't be enough jobs for everyone to get a wage . 
  so either we 'll collect some of that money as taxes ( which means cracking down on the colossal amount of fraud and it 's new and current brand name , `` evasion '' ) , and keep giving welfare with it instead of wages to those who do n't have one , or everybody will live in slums and the economy will crash shortly after because if nobody has an income nobody buys anything no matter the price . 
  see it as the problem of having 0 $ to your name but walking the alleyways of a lot of shops with shelf full of stuff but nobody ca n't afford any of it societywide so a couple years later the shop has to close down too . 
  he speaks broken french ( thick accent , eat some words , do n't decline etc ) ; but it 's understandable/usable ; you obviously can hold conversation with him in french and he understands it . 
  stuttering and similar could be attributed to speaking in public in a language he does n't speak perfectly while people try to corner him verbally i guess , it 's excusable, 
  a large part want a referendum to consolidate the fact that their opinion is democratically supported to stay in . 
  most people in france in fact are n't ( albeit , currently ) in favor of leaving . 
  damn , i 'm happy they 're finally admitting it 's a bad thing to destroy work laws in europe ( `` liberalization '' and `` deregulation '' ) and reducing everybody 's wages . 
  now whether they 'll act on it ... ( ps and your mek law , i 'm looking at you ... ), 
  still , i see the country get a check of 200 ' 000 ' 000 $ so i think it 's a positive move ( i just hope it 'll not end up stolen by corruption ; but that bit is not turkey 's fault at all , more of a barzani one )  a cut in the pipeline would drop the oil production of iraki to almost 0 , theorically they should have a part of the iraqi federal budget but ...  threatening the stability of the autonomous government and the peshmerga army it 's true they definitely have a financial problem ( and unpaid/late wages as of late ), 
  positive news about turkey for once ; ca n't say i complain about that one tho ( especially if they fund the krg , 
  you 're happy now that you 're independant . 
  a couple centuries ago people were busy dropping tea in the harbor as the us love to remind old europe ;-) then stuff like : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rebellions_of_1837 but it 's true canada/uk went nicer than other areas, 
   you do n't need to try to rationalize your xenophobia . 
  because i criticize some of what erdogan say or do now it 's `` xenophobia '' ? 
  holy hell  then why did the europeans refuse turkey back when akp was n't this strong and the country was ruled mostly by the secular people ? 
  probably because different people where in charge at the time and it 's almost like most of them turn seats in a democraty ... also notice how at the time turkey 's chances where 10x bigger and how he was a lot more liked there ? 
  and for all the time wasted was the same for everyone else , it always took like 30y to join the eu ... the other states just started getting closer 50y/60y ago after the end of wwii so they had a bit of head start, 
  i never said ( or thought ) anything remotely like some `` race theory '' ; and the pacific ocean countries i listed are at the opposite end of the planet so so much for that idea . 
  the main point i see common is a lack of extreme religious belief and a will to rebuild their country, 
  the colonisation excuse only go so far . 
  canada & the usa were colonised too yet succeeded . 
  japan or sk did even better in the span of 50 years . 
  china was invaded by half the neighboring countries in their history yet now sit as a world power too . 
  singapore was an uk colony . 
  so was australia . 
  new zealand . 
  etc hell ; even vietnam recovered to a correct degree after utterly brutal decolonization warfare ( french indochine independance war , which was probably as brutal as the current scw ) , revenge largescale economic destruction & followed by the even more brutal vietnam war . 
  it 's a recovery/correction . 
  so yes it 's `` big '' because they should never have faced a depression that deep in the first place . 
  it 's just heading back to `` normal '' economic levels . 
  ignoring the crash and it sector bailed out in exchange for snapback garrantees of keeping factories there ( if they delocalize the factories outside of europe it 's all seized . 
  ) ; real gdp growth on average is probably like 2 % . 
  edit : the government balance is n't the same number as the gdp , but i think it reflect quite well the real situation : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/post-2008_irish_economic_downturn#/media/file:government_surplus_or_deficit_since_2001_ ( piiggs_and_us ) . svg a huge crash followed by a climb back of the economy edit growth chart with possible speculations on the futur https://www.quandl.com/data/oda/irl_ngdp_rpch-ireland-gdp-at-constant-prices-change.png, 
   that is a pretty common view among european conservatives if you are talking about the tea party like mentality and the evangelist ; well fuck them ; how about they live their own life instead of trying to force their own crass taliban-like religious prohibitions on everyone else that is n't them or interested in it at all  nor alien to the conservative mindset in the west ( both in europe and the us ) . 
  see above \u00b2, 
   i was talking about were made by erdogan but by his wife are they independant on the subject ? 
  i 'm not entirely sure what 's going on in his household and do n't care enough to try finding out ; but in western countries on public speeches such speeches would definitely be coordinated and decided together . 
  for example you can be sure bill clinton had a hand in hillary 's speeches at least years ago . 
  same in france when people where joking that chirac 's wife was leading the country .

  islam is not european religion . 
  and europeans dont want turkey to join the eu . 
  that should be a sign . 
   actually police and firemen kinda ' did their jobs in this case . 
  uhm they didnt check for fire hazards hence the huge accident . 
   the townhall shouldnt have given the club permits in the first place okay so local authorities and not `` politicians '' in a general then . 
   i think , not signing a piece of paper without looking at it , only for money . 
  doing their job !, 
  things like that . 
  i think you 're confused . 
  politicians dont sign authorizations . 
  so the politicians are at fault because the police and firemen didnt do their jobs ? 
  what could a politician do more ? 
  are the laws not strict enough ? 
  who said the left is n't concerned about businesses ? 
  ibs ? 
  they can go screw themselves . 
  businesses are important though . 
  if it 's planning on introducing restriction for eu workers ( french , german , polish or bulgarian ) then it 'll have to leave the eea . 
  well that 's one of the main points cameron is pushing for .

  dew , rain , not wanting to get my clothes dirty , be sure i dont accidentally sit next to a dog turd , ants . 
  i always have napkins with me , enough to clean a bench but i rarely have a tarp . 
  what if you wan na take a nap on a bench ? 
  the mayor of an istanbul district that decided to install the seats :  . i know they are concerned that sitting with a stranger , with a man they do not know , will fuel rumors that the woman on the bench is having an affair . 
  i 've sat on benches with both unknown women and unknow men . 
  i 'm such a slut y' all \u00af \\ _ ( \u30c4 ) _ / \u00af . 
  and i do n't plan to stop . 
   if `` ifs '' and `` buts '' were candy and nuts , would n't it be a merry christmas ? 
   the rest of europe ? 
  france was independent before 2008 and still likes to fly solo . 
  so what else ? 
  italy ? 
  spain ? 
  not that impressive . 
   eu commission to delay its report that would shake ruling party 's status-quo yes ... because the voters of of erdogan really care what the eu thinks ... do you realise how nationalists vote ? 
  the eu report would have raised the erdogan vote : lets stick it to those europeans . 
  sorry , i thought they had a democratic free vote . 
  am i mistaken ? 
  if people vote for that guy , do you want european countries to invade ? 
  throw a fit ? 
   i presume all of them romanian medics who left to work abroad . 
  uhm . 
  you 're welcome ? 
  yes because i 'm sure a stern report from the eu would have changed * everything * . 
   but europe sure as shit is helping out the wrong side . 
  welcome to realpolitik . 
  winning hearts and minds is fine and dandy , but at times you have to be realistic . 
   we do n't have the cash that arabic states have start buying migs and see what 'll happen . 
   strong army so ... military spending ? 
   i could go as far as to say that turkey is the most important/active country in nato after us and uk . 
  who 's left after you remove those countries ? 
  germany ? 
  at least an hour after the room has been evacuated and ventilated . 
   the tables set right up to the edge of the restaurant . 
  your table inside , your arm outside , smoking away . 
  your table is either inside or outside . 
  it ca n't be both . 
  inside means you have walls , windows and doors that separate you from a table inside the restaurant . 
  i 'm talking about tables that are outside completely . 
   the motivation of a crime should n't matter thats not how the law system works . 
  motivation is one of the most important aspects of why crimes are committed . 
  a sentence should reflect why a crime has happened . 
  exactly what i was thinking . 
  htf do you go from :  it may not be oppression but there are hate crime laws . 
  to  because murdering someone is only bad when it 's ethnically motivated . 
  yay tolerance !, 
   because murdering someone is only bad when it 's ethnically motivated . 
  yay tolerance !, 
  holy `` putting words in other people 's mouth '' batman !, 
  it 's forbidden to smoke in closed public areas or work places . 
  bars and such can offer closed off rooms with ac and automatic doors where people can smoke but no service must be provided ( even cleaning service ) . 
   http://legifrance.gouv.fr/affichtexte.do?cidtexte=jorftext000000818309&amp;datetexte=&amp;categorielien=id of course it can happen for people to smoke at outside tables sometimes . 
  while no major change ( health of workers , lowered profits for bars , etc ) has been noticed , bars are so much nicer to be in when you dont have a ton of smoke in your face . 
  as long as they buy guns from the `` right '' countries , they 'll be a-ok . 
   $ 6-10 if you go to a lunch restaurant . 
  what that 's super cheap . 
  12-15 euros here . 
  it may not be oppression but there are hate crime laws . 
  well it 's much easier to have a full picture of the problem when your economy is smaller . 
  policies become more easily predictable . 
  heck the whole mess happened because iceland banks tried to pretend they were larger than they really were . 
   . most do not follow the quran to the letter a ** lot ** of muslims do not drink . 
  that 's a reality . 
  and yeah people dont follow the old testament because xtianity is based on the new testament . 
  well people who dont give a crap about ecology , resources , also about aboriginals and immigrants . 
  those are the negatives because i think you wan na know about those . 
   . they are at rougly double ( depending on type of drink ) of sweden . 
  and everybody in europe thinks sweden has suuuuper high alcohol taxes . 
  and you 're saying they 're double . 
  and it 's not * that * high ? 
  c'mon  how does this affect what continent turkey belongs to ? 
  where is the capital of turkey ? 
  on what continent do 70 % live ? 
  what 's the language ? 
  what 's the writing system ( before ataturk ) ? 
  what 's the religion ?

  are n't those `` national interests '' just whatever the national government claim they are , more than often based on the interests of corporations and the wealthy ? 
  if you go this way , in the end , it is just individual interests , and individuals debate and vote so that in the end a common decision is made . 
  that decision is what the common interest is . 
  well it works the same for europe . 
  many french people might want to intervene more in africa , and many german people might not want that , but then even if no amount of debate manage to change those positions , it is up for the majority to decide . 
  that 's exactly the same as with every single other piece of eu policy . 
  states think they benefit from being in the eu so they accept that `` the european interest '' decided by the states and parliament will be imposed to them . 
  if they think it is in their interest to have a unified military ( and i think it is in our interest ) , then they will have to accept that this military will follow the goals of the eu as a whole rather than their own . 
  you 're assuming a european military would get directed by consensus of the 28 member states . 
  of course this would make no sense and be even more tragic than the eurozone mess . 
  as i stated in other posts though , in my eyes it 's pretty obvious that a united military should be led by a eu government , or a president , not by secret negociations of 28 national leaders meeting once in a while and taking ages to agree on anything . 
  do you imagine the us military being commanded by a council of the 50 state governors , and needing a supermajority to do anything ? 
  you need someone in charge , able to react rapidly and clearly . 
  not necessarily . 
  even without spending one cent more than we do , a united military would be very certainly more powerful , because of economies of scale and higher efficiency , and the saved money could be invested in better equipment , drones , etc. 
  i 'm not saying we should n't also spend more , though . 
  currently very few countries meet the nato targets . 
  a federal eu government just means european-level decisions would be made by directly elected european institutions , rather than by national governments . 
  it does n't mean we have to or should unify our cultures , nations and `` all aspects of life '' . 
  my bad . 
  the eu already provides for mandatory defensive assistance if one member is attacked , and we can already form the coalitions we want , so that 's not really the question . 
  the question of a european military is definitely a question of common european leadership and policy . 
  as long as the armies are not fused , i guess it 'd be normal to allow states to opt out from a non-defensive conflict . 
  but otherwise , it is clear that if you want a capable leadership in defense and foreign policy , you ca n't give it to a council of 28 national governments meeting not even once a month . 
  this is the recipe for failure . 
  it has to be assumed by a single , elected eu government ( either the commission or a president ) . 
  they are already legally bound to , by both nato and the eu . 
  obviously a united military implies it would be commanded from a single common leadership and follow a single common foreign policy . 
  as for national interests and goals , it is irrelevant : a european military would defend the interests of the eu as a whole and the goals of the eu as a whole defined by the eu government . 
  i think that the details of building a unified military are very complex , that it would take a lot of time to achieve it and it might not be the best organization to fuse everything into a single army . 
  still , it is very important for our geopolitical power , our defense and our independence that we build an integrated common foreign and defence policy and that we make our militaries work together . 
  it reminds me a fable by la fontaine about the monster with one head and a thousand tails ( the ottomans ) which terrorized the land , and the monster with one tail but a thousand heads ( the hre ) , which did n't know where to go and pathetically trapped itself at the first fence . 
  while it would be certainly more efficient to have only one big army , the priority is to have only one clear leadership . 
  all the current issues of the eu come down to a single one : the absence of federalism . 
  we need an actual european government with the power and legitimacy to make those decisions if that is what people want . 
  currently all issues are dragged forever and unanswered because they are negociated between national governments on the basis of their own conflicting interests ( and need a supermajority ) , instead of just being openly debated and decided by voters and parliament . 
  a united european military does n't mean the eu ca n't be part of an alliance with the us . 
  but it would completely change our relationship . 
  from client states protected by the superpower and following its command , we would become equals , able to negociate on the same footing , defend our own interests first , and intervene alone if necessary . 
  that 's it ? 
  just logos ? 
  as shown by david ricardo , all restriction on trade even designed to boost your trade surplus is actually hurting your own economy as well . 
  but the comparison with mercantilism is n't even good anyway , since the european trade surplus does n't come from protectionism but on the contrary from free trade . 
  we trade far more with the rest of the world than the usa does , but while we have the highest trade surplus they have the largest trade deficit . 
  only the cap works like a mercantilist policy but i doubt that 's where all the surplus comes from . 
  having a trade surplus in itself is not bad in any way . 
  of course it means that we do n't import as much things as we could afford , but so what ? 
  instead , we re-invest the money to make benefits , just like china , the gulf countries , etc. 
   the eurozone already has large fiscal transfer . 
  hmm , the european budget is barely 1 % of gdp , and only a fraction of it is spent on actual fiscal transfers towards the poorer states . 
  yes , we do that a lot . 
  but we also `` tchip '' ( * suck our teeth * in english ) . 
  it 's mostly a black thing , and it 's said only black people do it right , but now it 's spreading to the rest of the population . 
  [ here 's a video on it from arte 's karambolage . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_a7znlxsha ) edit : [ the transcript in french . 
  ] ( http://www.arte.tv/magazine/karambolage/fr/le-quotidien-le-tchip-karambolage ) [ the transcript in german . 
  yeah , it 's a bit far-fetched to say that verlan was `` a verbal rebellion against french as the language of colonisation '' when it was already used in literature in the 50s ... 
  but otherwise the examples are good . 
  bearded drag-queen singer ? 
  bosnia confirmed for european . 
  isis is certainly much closer to the original 7th century spirit of islam than western gay-friendly liberal `` muslims '' , but the point was that even isis chooses to ignore the bits that annoy them and do n't serve their agenda . 
  [ and 73 % of german muslims also think homosexuality is morally unacceptable . 
  ] ( http://www.pewforum.org/files/2013/04/worlds-muslims-religion-politics-society-full-report.pdf ) those numbers are not so contradictory though . 
  you can very well be okay with something being legal for others , but oppose it and not want it in your own community . 
  it 's a big principle in islam that different religious communities should live by their own rules ( yes , i know that contradicts other islamic rules against non-believers , but still , that 's a big principle ) : for instance in morocco it is forbiden to eat during ramadan * if you 're a muslim * . 
  in the west , muslims are also generally siding with the socially liberal left , which reinforced that spirit of `` just let people live how they want '' . 
  so it 's still a good result , but it does n't mean that german muslims are actually all that gay friendly , which is still worrying , especially for their own potentially gay children , for whom they might have different standards of acceptance than for strangers . 
  it 's sadly true too often , and that 's where almost all terrorists/isis-volunteers come from , normal people from pretty non-religious families who escaped their own failures by embracing religious extremism . 
  but still that 's the exception , not the rule . 
  statistically , each new generation is less religious and more assimilated . 
  and it 's very important to remember that . 
  the generalizations of all people of muslim/arab origin with the religious extremists is very detrimental , because it rejects the non-religious , the `` cultural muslims '' and the moderates away from the rest of the population and groups them into a single `` muslim community '' defined by a religion which we definitely do n't want them to take too seriously . 
  in other words , it means refusing that they assimilate and on the contrary reminding them they 're muslims before all . 
  not surprising some end up thinking precisely that . 
  a french of vietnamese origin might have had very religious grandparents and his parents might still identify with buddhism and practice some of its traditions , but we 'd not call that guy a buddhist without asking him ( that 's a matter of private , personnal belief ) , and we 'd certainly not see him as a buddhist before anything else . 
  we would just see him as a normal guy , and he 'd have a normal french life . 
  if he has an identity crisis , it 's extremely unlikely he 'd think about taking refuge in radical ascetic buddhism , shave his head , meditate all day , etc. 
  there is obviously no absolute limit for `` overpopulation '' , it depends on resources , and those resources are vastly boosted by human ingeniosity . 
  malthus did n't predict that the agricultural output would increase exponentially thanks to chemical fertilizers . 
  but still it does n't change that natural resources are eventually limited , and that the more people there are , the more difficult it will be to solve shortages , the more expensive they will be and the more people will end up deprived of them . 
  we 've recently passed the day at which the 2015 natural resources have been arguably consumed . 
  if we are to have an actually sustainable world economy , we 'll need to consume less . 
  it does n't mean we ca n't do it with 7 or 9 or 12 billion people , but that would mean renouncing to our modern western way of life ( no , not just american wasteful extremities ) . 
  it would be incredibly easier to reach sustainability if we were not as many . 
  in that sense , we definitely are overpopulated . 
  same in france , we use `` arobase '' even for addresses . 
  the 1789 declaration of human rights was focused on building proper rule of law after centuries of absolute monarchy , more than it was in actually guaranteeing rights . 
  which is also why contrary to the us supreme court there was no way to use the declaration to actually limit government powers . 
  it was more of a moral , indicative declaration . 
  so yes , most of the articles are just variations of : government can only do x if that was properly decided by law . 
  which is an important concept , but it does n't actually give any real limit on government power . 
  i would prefer something like the udhr article 19 ( * `` everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression ; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek , receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers . 
  '' * ) or the us 1st amendment ( * `` congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion , or prohibiting the free exercise thereof ; or abridging the freedom of speech , or of the press ; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble , and to petition the government for a redress of grievances . '' * ) . 
  they give actual limits to government power , not just some vague declaration of principle . 
  now you could argue that there needs to be limits on free speech , and that 's another debate , but those limits should be made a bit more clear . 
  the us must be extremely naive to think europeans will vote in favour of isds 29 times in a row ( eu parliament + all national parliaments ) when citizens and national governments are so widely opposed to it . 
  why ca n't they just propose a regular trade deal ? 
  we would all benefit from it . 
  i guess the us government is so much in the hands of corporate lobbies that not even diplomatic common sense would make them deviate even a bit from what those lobbies want . 
  the thing is that there is no trace of that supposed money in his campaign accounts , which were limited by law anyway and sufficiently funded .

  probably a mix of better controlling the schengen border , stabilize origin countries and get agreements with them to send people back , and actually making sure the real refugees are managed . 
  those who could were sent back . 
  the others scattered over different cities with capacity to manage undocumented migrants . 
  they did . 
  a few months ago they finally did what all the internet tough guys wanted , destroy the camp , arrest them all and send them to various places . 
  as expected the problem came back . 
  there is no simple solution to this . 
  it 's not just up to france to solve . 
  it 's not . 
  flash news , illegal migrants do not respect the law . 
  well the government did exactly that a few months ago . 
  but as expected the migrants came back . 
  and they get free entrance to the eu market too . 
  market benefits go both ways , and additionally they get investment in their infrastructure . 
  it 's a much better deal than the `` rich '' countries , which have to pay for it . 
  and yet it 's still worth it for them . 
  right , they push you to leave by investing 13 billion euros per year into your country . 
  fun fact : it is reportedly the origin of a popular expression in france , `` mettre la pat\u00e9e '' , meaning to crush completely something or someone . 
  lots of people swim to exercise also . 
  it 's new for me and this is horrible . 
  the worst is the night temperature , it 's 30 \u00b0 c all night in the apartment . 
  there are courses in english in quite a lot of unis now . 
  germany , france , the netherlands , switzerland , sweden ... are all quite good . 
  yes , on a ranking that measures things the anglo-saxon university system is good at . 
  in practice , when you look at hiring around the continent , other countries do just as well if not better when it comes to how the private sector views the unis . 
   she 's clearly had a very sheltered life i thought she was very naughty . 
   kerfluffle maybe you did n't get the memo , but that 's been renamed a `` covfefe '' . 
  how about a `` squishy '' brexit then ? 
  i disagree a bit . 
  i studied in the uk for a year some years ago , and yes the reputation and courses are good . 
  the proof that you speak english too . 
  however there are other universities all over europe which are at least just as good , and have a similar reputation . 
  of course it depends on your field . 
  i 'm in engineering . 
  with the uk in the eu , the cost was high but still accessible . 
  since a few years , the price has increased significantly already . 
  but in the future , the price for eu citizens will probably not be worth it , or at least make it much less attractive compared to other eu countries . 
  when i was there , non-eu students had to pay 3 times the price of eu ones . 
  if they apply it to every non-british after brexit that 's not worth it unless you 're american or your company pays for it . 
  the education and reputations are n't going to get significantly worse . 
  but the price will definitely make it even less worth it than now . 
  most western and northern europe countries offer alternatives which are just as good . 
  i did n't pay nearly that a few years ago . 
  it was a few thousand pounds for a masters . 
  they 're going to send their navy ? 
  not to be confused with the sun , that they do not have . 
  just like most people would choose to stop paying taxes , if they could keep all the services . 
  it depends on the policy applied by the specific carrier . 
  but the european regulation allows them to charge roaming if you were physically abroad a majority of the time in the last 4 months , and you used the majority of your data/calls/texts from abroad in those 4 months . 
  [ the uk is turning towards eastern influence i see ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7vsuuoqgxa ), 
  you do n't pay for an army you do n't control . 
  it just takes one operator not applying or getting their exemption refused to move the market there . 
  if one operator offers free roaming , the others will have to follow . 
  well he did exit the first tram to get into the less-crowded second one , that 's definitely scandinavian behaviour . 
  no , to have bad accent you need to speak english at least . 
  i have some colleagues who can make you rethink what an extremely heavy accent can be . 
  and they speak english at work every day . 
  that 's the point , no ? 
  what i understand from that statement is that countries like luxembourg would lose tax money if they raised their effective tax rates . 
  and he 's saying that it would be cheaper for large countries to fund these little countries for that lost revenue , and have companies actually pay their taxes in those large countries . 
  of course it ca n't work because a country ca n't just ask for direct money by threatening to lower their effective corporate rate . 
  but it shows how inefficient the whole system is . 
  by the way , i specify * effective * tax rate because in many cases the problem is n't the official tax rate but the tax breaks that these countries distribute to foreign companies . 
  we said that in france about a year ago . 
  actually even hollande said it in private at the time . 
  it 's only second after silly walks . 
  just go to sainsbury 's you pleb . 
  yes , i would imagine that the fact there 's a waitrose there is a a consequence of the wealth of the area , not the cause . 
  if this is true , this is the explosion of the fn . 
  a wasteland ? 
  we 'll take that kind of wasteland any day . 
  are you sure you 're not mixing up with the north ? 
  yes i left at 16 ( only came back on the holidays ) but that 's uncommon . 
  it did me a lot of good though . 
  in france they try to educate to 5 fruits and vegetables per day , but i do n't think anybody tries to respect that . 
  unless you count the grapes in your wine , in which case it 's easy . 
  it 's not all about topography though . 
  some places just do n't have that culture . 
  my spanish colleague lived in germany for several years , and i found out he did n't have a bicycle . 
  his city was pretty bicycle friendly , but spanish people use cars , that 's it . 
  it did n't seem to occur to him that he could cycle for transportation . 
  you can see it in the city layouts actually . 
  madrid is made for cars in mind , clearly . 
  it 's pretty bad to cycle there actually , and rare . 
  i was pretty keen on city cycling before , but i sold my bike a bit after i moved there . 
  yes . 
  that 's in the program i think though . 
   that 's very low in germany why is that ? 
  looks like my autocorrect decided to suggest an invasion . 
  dassault syst\u00e8mes is pretty big on engineering solutions ( cad and plm ) . 
  at the same time , the other extreme is n't always that efficient either . 
  in silicon valley they are quick to give millions for the nth messaging app or food delivery service , but that does n't make a lot of economic interest . 
  in the end they encourage every motivated clever guy to spend their life developing yet another useless phone app instead of creating value that matters . 
  anyway , there are some european software for engineers which are at the top of their field , such as dassault syst\u00e8mes for cad ( catia , solidworks ... ) and plm . 
  ~ ~ you ~ ~ it would be a good solution to finally get rid of this problem . 
  that 's really pleasing . 
  finally the guy can actually hold a conversation in english , making proper sentences and articulating his thought fluently . 
  ok he has an accent , but it 's definitely acceptable . 
  incredible that these stupid journalists spent 3 minutes repeating that he 's walking alone , but not one remarked that the music was the ode to joy . 
  they already account for this though .

  if i ever have a daughter , i 'll name her eudoxia for sure . 
  classical liberalism and thatcherite ideals are the single most poisonous political ideas in france . 
  fillon backed off on his promises during the primaries almost immediately . 
  iirc because it 's a self-defeating system . 
  the supply of gold ca n't keep up with the expansion of trade and thus the circulation of money in the world . 
  or something . 
  i may be talking out of my ass here , correct me if i am . 
  conveniently forgetting about the patriot act , and ignoring anything released by snowden , though . 
  also that slate article is from 2006 . 
  we know much more now than then ( especially since it has absolute r/shitamericanssay material such as `` and europeans have no equivalent to the american constitution , which enshrines the right of individuals to be free from government coercion '' ) . 
  you 're talking about warrantless wiretapping - but legal and police traditions are not the same on both sides of the atlantic , making that comparison a bit superfluous . 
  what does exist is the massive harvesting of private data of us citizens ( and everybody else , really ) , by governmental organisations . 
  i 'll add that when google , facebook , microsoft , etc. 
  have been shown to let the us government look at their data , protecting consumers from corporations is , in effect , protecting them from the government . 
  that 's still a lot - i do n't think my parents know such a thing as skyrim or gta exists !, 
  no , i was referring to domestic activities as well . 
  question for polish people - how is cdprojekt red seen in poland , outside of the gamer and millenial demographics , by the general population and the media ? 
  are people generally aware of them ? 
  the witcher 3 is in the top selling games on steam , so yeah . 
   the eu places more restrictions on what companies may do . 
  the us places more restrictions on what the government may do . 
  i refuse to believe you typed that out with a straight face . 
  remove patois remove patois french greatest language remove filthy backwards dialects from the premises, 
  you and [ thousands of others , homie ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jediism ), 
  they do have a terrible marketing / pr department . 
  but otherwise information is n't hidden at all . 
  in fact the eu websites are way more informative and open than many others . 
  it 's ... not the eu 's fault if citizens do n't know the channels to voice opposition . 
  despite the fact that they exist . 
  writing to your mp is a normal and natural thing to do in national politics , why not writing to your mep ? 
  as if . 
  most people do n't care about e2ee and will be very easily swayed by the `` it 's to stop the terrorists !, 
  nothing to fear if you have nothing to hide ! '', 
  arguments . 
  how ... how is terrorism even remotely related to the eu ? 
  we have that sort of outlook on things . 
  the same attitude exists vis-a-vis anything . 
  we value solidarity , but we have record levels of mistrust in one another . 
  we believe in a strong role for the state , but we do n't trust it . 
  the lisbon treaty was voted by our own parliament . 
  it was part of the platform of sarkozy who 'd been elected . 
  the lisbon treaty is not the same as the 2005 treaty that we rejected . 
  the uk never wanted to be a real part of the eu . 
  all they wanted was just a big giant free trade zone , with no regulation and no political project whatsoever . 
  the uk entering the eec in the first place just should n't have happened , and is basically a big historical misunderstanding . 
  the eu was always a political project , and british politicians sold it to the british public as just an economic union . 
  just remember how they threw a fit at juncker becoming the president of the eu commission and wanting another guy chosen behind closed doors between governments , despite juncker being , you know , elected . 
  and after that we keep hearing the eu is undemocratic . 
  this is just one example , there are countless others . 
  so yeah , losing the uk is n't great on the whole . 
  but it 's better that than dragging along a country that does n't want to be part of it was just going to be bad for both the uk and the eu . 
  [ this op-ed by ex french pm michel rocard ] ( http://www.lemonde.fr/idees/article/2014/06/05/amis-anglais-sortez-de-l-union-europeenne-mais-ne-la-faites-pas-mourir_4431399_3232.html ) way back in 2014 basically sums up why it is reasonable to want the uk to leave the eu from an eu perspective . 
  ( actually i might translate and post it here someday ) . 
  both the napoleonic code and german law are based off roman civil law , or , to be more precise , on the compilation and re-ordering done by based justinian and tribonian . 
  [ justinian 's * institutes * ] ( http://amesfoundation.law.harvard.edu/digital/cjciv/jinst.pdf ) ( a textbook for law students ) makes for an interesting read , and some parts sound incredibly modern , for something written 1 500 years ago and itself based on principles that were a few centuries older , too :  justice is the set and constant purpose which gives to every man his due . 
   jurisprudence is the knowledge of things divine and human , the science of the just and the unjust . 
   the precepts of the law are these : to live honestly , to injure no one , and to give every man his due . 
   freedom , from which men are called free , is a man 's natural power of doing what he pleases , so far as he is not prevented by force or law, 
  the whole field of administrative law ( which is a huge deal ) is pretty much entirely jurisprudential in nature . 
  erm , the first jet fighters were german , then british ... 
  eu law is kinda sorta a mix of napoleonic and german law . 
  good riddance . 
  it 's obviously much better this way . 
  now we can move forward with the european project ( especially if there 's a macron / schulz duo in power ) , and the uk can accomplish its dream of becoming the 51st state . 
  lol it was the uk who wanted `` informal negotiations '' behind closed doors ... 
  oh right , i never really looked up at the guy , i just knew him as `` that guy who talked about pan-europa in the 1920s '' ... 
   and isds is not ? 
  in both cases they 're extranational courts/committees judging national legislation . 
  that 's the whole point , because the whole underlying assumption is that national judiciaries are jingoistic and partial . 
  isds is two parties accepting to give judgment to an impartial third party . 
  it 's nothing like have another country judiciary using judging cases via another countries ' laws . 
  no judge would ever accept that . 
   i do n't see why it 's so important to deny that these are partial accomodations . 
  what is wrong with taking into account feedback from civil society ? 
  `` partial accomodations '' makes it sound like they 're only minor changes . 
  they 're not . 
   opposition against isds is active for way longer than wallonia 's last minute stage fever . 
  sure , i just thought that you were pushing that line , which you were n't . 
  wow , coudenhove-kalergi had some pretty weird views on race . 
  he wanted a general white - black - jewish mix for humanity to look like the ancient egyptians . 
   there 's an alternative : if a company has exhausted juridical means of contesting a decision in one signatory , then they could bring it to the upper court of the other signatory . 
  if those agree , the point is moot . 
  if those disagree , the issue is brought on the table of the signatory countries again , who then need to clarify or add a rule to make sure the upper courts interprete it the same . 
  maybe i misunderstand , but how would this work ? 
  suppose a canadian company has a complaint about treatment from an eu government in which it 's established ( say france ) . 
  they bring it up with the french court , are n't satisfied so bring it up in appeal again , etc. 
  all the way to the top french court ( either the council of state or the court of cassation ) . 
  still does n't work . 
  so they go to the only court on top of that , the european court of justice . 
  still , the ecj says `` fuck off '' . 
  your solution means then the canadian company 's other solution is to turn to ... the canadian supreme court ? 
  who would then statute with regards to the treaty and with regards to french and eu law ? 
  that 's ... not going to work , or be accepted . 
  it 's a serious breach of sovereignty . 
   nota bene : these partial accommodations would n't even have been considered without the pressure and criticism against ceta and isds . 
  well , they 're not partial accomodations . 
  they 're simply a new way of doing these things . 
  and they came out of mutual canadian and european understanding that the traditional arbitration system was politically no longer acceptable , and that this new , very judicial one would work better . 
  if you 're thinking about the `` it was changed thanks to wallonia 's opposition '' , do n't . 
  it 's a fake narrative pushed by the walloon socialists for pr .

  33 % are for it .

  yeah , we are slowly losing our advance in the global economy . 
  this means that french are becoming poorer and poorer , and it will continue . 
  the only reason we were rich in the first place is because we had colonies and because our ancestors committed atrocities . 
  people are fucking naive if they think we can retain our priviledges ( high quality of life , pensions , social safety ) without robbing blind other countries . 
  this is not the problem of people in power stabbing people , this is barely a blimp in the face of history . 
  this is simply the normal march of the world . 
  either we become imperialist fucks like the usa or russia , or we continue decaying slowly . 
  the left has to shake off this hypocrisy . 
  either we stand for moral principles , human rights and liberty , or we stand for our people getting the longer end of the sticks against `` others '' . 
  this is the current dichotomy of the left , and there are still populists claiming that they would be able to reconcile both ends . 
  this is obviously a crock of shit . 
  some will . 
  it 's still better than nothing when debating with the likes of / r/le _ pen and consort . 
  google will simply remove anything pejorative about persons in its suggestions . 
  is france threatening the annihilation of a neighbor country ? 
  they are saying that from the european pov . 
  of course it makes sense for americans to do so . 
  well , i never spammed in the first place , so of course i wo n't stop  . 
  i 'm not the one shitposting and being aggressive . 
  if you ca n't understand his sentence , do you seriously think that you would be able to understand a philosophical argument about linguistic and meaning in text ? 
  i think you are asking for things you would not be able to deal with . 
  france would manage this just as well as the uk : badly . 
  i do n't want the current anti-eu parties to be anywhere near an office that will decide a budget in the following years . 
  their populist appeals will , with absolute certainty , steer them away from rational policing . 
  well , he is not , and if you are unable to follow a simple discussion on the internet you should stop being aggressive to other and just stop posting . 
  usually i do not downvote you for your opinion , but because you are strawmaning and insufferable with your interlocutor . 
  you are extremely arrogant , unfair in your rhetoric and using cheap tricks when debating . 
  you seem to think that it 's somehow not clear to the reader , but obviously it is . 
  that and of course you ideas are unpopular , but even unpopular ideas do not garner downvotes like you do . 
   i am not convinced that among the population of the eurozone as a whole , leaving the eurozone has no mainstream appeal . 
  politicians just say whatever will garner them vote . 
  if it had a mainstream appeal , you 'd see mainstream politicians proposing it . 
  you seem to operate under the assumption that there is some conspiracy , as if there was a cabal orchestrated against this idea . 
  the eu still requires a free society for membership , and these anti-eu ideas are still free to be expressed . 
  it is not a conspiracy , it is simply that you are on the fringe and have a hard time realizing it . 
   i have no idea wtf you are talking about . 
  you should probably work on your reading comprehension . 
   well , we agree . 
  you conveniently left out `` i 'm saying i have complete confidence in the immorality of the anti-eu parties . 
  holy shit you 're dense . 
  why are you talking about snapchat and periscope ? 
  as i said , their public is younger , not of voting age . 
  the source was about the us , but it is the same in france . 
  when 90 % of the users are over 18 in the us , you can consider that a large majority is over 18 in france as well . 
  you 're very optimistic . 
  teens do not use facebook , that a thing for the previous generation . 
  teens use snapshat or periscope . 
  https://isl.co/2014/01/3-million-teens-leave-facebook-in-3-years-the-2014-facebook-demographic-report/ granted , it 's for the us , but the vast , vast majority of people using facebook are absolutely of voting age . 
  as for learning how to read classic news , you seem to have missed the massive crisis traditional medias are having this decade . 
  economic liberalism , social progressivism . 
  he has been very evasive about the details of his program . 
  we only know of it what he said in interviews , in public meetings or from his positions when in the government . 
  voters ? 
  the left-wing populist is m\u00e9lenchon . 
  liberalism is certainly not among the populist programs these days . 
  yes we do . 
  we have a galaxy of identitarian movements that are very active on social networks and will spread fake news about migrants and supposed conspiracy by the msm and the `` umps '' or how everyone is out to get there while putting their head in the sand in the face of * the greatest treat france has ever known * ^ ( tm ) , the [ grand remplacement ] ( https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/grand_remplacement ) . 
  yes , we have fake news . 
  and do not believe for a second that russia will stop at financially backing the fn . 
  he was a traitor to the socialist party , which is not equivalent to a social traitor . 
  the parti socialist is a social-democrat party . 
  it follows keynesianism and is generally liberal . 
  it is not socialism . 
  meh , it 's not too bad . 
  it allows for pretty much all political colors to be present and to have a voice , with the smaller parties being allowed positions in the new government if they bring in voices , and at the same time it keeps out the extremes . 
  the socialists are left , not far-left . 
  the far-left has not won a major election in decades . 
  it is one of your recurring antics : you always tell that people who do not agree with you are confused and upset . 
  you are incredibly arrogant . 
   eu people are currently going through grief and confused feelings about the uk . 
  your arrogance is touching , but no . 
  there is no `` except '' here , this is exactly what the parent comment said . 
  you 're putting as if it was something that was disputed or debated . 
  it 's not . 
   that doesnt mean they want war and the eradication of jews throughout europe . 
  no , it will mean that they will seek the eradication of any group of people they deem to be against the interest of the people , whichever they may be and obviously , aligned with their own self-interest . 
  it so happen that we have a perfect scapegoat , muslim migrants , that are used by populist all over europe to gain power . 
   the problem with populism is not that its inherently bad it is . 
  it is inherently bad , because the root of populism is an `` us-vs-them '' mentality to gain power at the expense of the very people that are believing they will make them their problems disappear . 
  the us-vs-them rhetoric will ** always ** destroy the fabric of society and togetherness that makes democracy possible . 
  even if with the best intention in mind , it is hurtful and dangerous , in and of itself . 
  the usual stances of the church on most societal issues are pretty conservative . 
  usually the church itself is considered to be pretty removed from the world , out of touch in a way . 
  being conservative thus mean being right wing , simple as that . 
  there has been a long tradition of being `` leftist catholics '' as well in france , but their vote will not be going to a candidate that touts his religion publicly . 
  only on the right does it helps garner votes . 
  so bringing your religion publicly in france means that you are chasing rightist votes . 
   well , that 's * inspiring * ... as i 've said already on a number of occasions , democracy 's main problem is exactly illiteracy . 
  i think you have a vastly inflated idea of how much people care about what you said . 
  then for all your smugness , you obviously have no idea what you are talking about . 
  it has . 
  social democracies apply keynesian economics along with some limited socialism . 
  socialism would be to make all means of production publicly owned . 
  currently you have a mix of semi public or nationalized companies , along with fully private one . 
  this allows to protect some fundamental state functions , like healthcare , defense or energy . 
  any critical sector has state participation to ensure that it will not go bankrupt or fall prey to outside influence , like chinese dumping killing these companies then rising prices once the market is entirely captive . 
  this is how pretty much all western democracies functions . 
  the anglo saxon way however would be to let these outside influence happen , as illustrated by the recent opposition of the uk to forbidding chinese access to some critical infrastructure , in opposition to france and germany on the matter at the eu level . 
  well , yes . 
  yeah , forget the collusion with the facho-sphere .

  if you think you can just push everyone to live on scrap while telling them `` by the rule of capitalism it 's all mine , miiine ! '', 
  it 's going to blow up in your face one of those day . 
   labour ca n't magically become more valuable , and resources do n't go up just because people have more cash . 
  actually if nobody has any cash to spend because a group of people keep it all out of the general population 's hands , the economy stalls . 
  it 's currently happening already . 
   why do you think they are there ? 
  because we called them there to lessen the economic crisis in ireland ~ ~ and since dell was crashing due to retarded shareholders politics we had the opportunity to pick them up in exchange of them owing us one ? ~ ~  in 2015 the uk over took you lol not really . 
  i think the uk even partly wants to leave due to authoritarian france using it 's position to give too much orders for it 's liking . 
   tax evasion through corruption is n't enticing to big companies . 
  tax `` evasion '' is just a fancy name for legalized tax fraud & corruption . 
  it 's in britain . 
  it 's up to them to integrate . 
  not the other way around . 
  they have no right by english law to block that nomination as far as i understand ? 
  now remove 15-20 % to the popularity of putin & his gov on this graphic , and you 'd be pretty much in reality . 
  which would still make envious a lot of politicians , but a lot less higher beyond super-putin propaganda . 
  beside what can happen when you have skyhigh max popularity & it 's not entirely based on reality but a lot of hype ? 
  well , it can only go one way . 
   not even sure why they 're putting it to a vote . 
  to see throught the propaganda bs what the population really wants in majority . 
  it 's a vote of confidence , whether deep down they support the eu or the more independantist uk authorities, 
   vat is charged at the point of sale , you 're getting confused again about corporation tax . 
  http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/dec/22/tax-officials-investigate-amazon-ebay-vat-fraud-overseas-sellers  you 're retarded , find a single example of large companies evading personal income tax , the tax paid by their employees . 
  the ones earning the bulk of the money ( ceo , shareholders , etc ) all stash it abroad off the book . 
  the wages of workers are only a small percent of the cash flow nowadays . 
   a ) skilled workers are paid well , unskilled labourers arent because any dick off the street can do it . 
  but that dick off the street need to eat too . 
  if you do n't pay him enough to have a roof , do n't wonder why there are shanty towns poping up in london 's outskirts . 
  and if you import million of unskilled pakistanis workers as cheap ( borderline unpaid ) undeclared work like corporations colluded to do in the 60 's after the end of their indian colony & the associated exploitation , then maybe you are part of the problem . 
   b ) stashing trillions abroad is using emotive language and you know it , no it 's not . 
  but we 're at the point where nobody believes how much money exists in our society since it all disappear abroad and nobody apart a few ever see the color of it . 
  and that 's one of the biggest issues of our society . 
   d ) corporation tax is a tax on profit and can never work here 's my answer just as backed : `` lol '' . 
   the uk has the economy it does because it is one of the tax havens of europe ah the russian economic argument . 
  `` if you remove the oligarchs , what remains ? '' . 
  pray tell , what was the western answer to that . 
  put a minimal wage . 
  rise wages . 
  stop stealing all the money . 
  collect taxes . 
  root out gov-wide & countrywide corruption . 
  rebuild the public service that was dismantled . 
  the infra and housing that was sold for quick money . 
  etc * etc etc  ireland has similar growth because of the same . 
  ireland do happen to have some it industry actually by some tiny miracle ( dell & all the ones orbiting around , which attracted actual r&d offices of some other tech giants very recently ) . 
  edit : i mean , their gdp growth litterally come from dell ~ ~ just after we picked back the company and convinced michael dell to recover it from big finance ~ ~ : http://www.finfacts.ie/irishfinancenews/article_1028474.shtml http://www.finfacts.ie/irishfinancenews/article_1025198.shtml  other countries , like france , moan about evil capitalists exploiting the proletariat of france because they dont want to pay high levels of tax and somehow we 're nearly richer than you . 
  questions ? 
  :-p  this is why france 's economy is stagnating while other sane countries are growing steadily . 
  no , it 's stagnating because we have a foreign policy problem ( well more that one in fact ) that 's currently draining ressources at an absurd rate . 
  we spent additionnal cash as fast as we made it since a few years . 
  but a lot of it was investing in neighbors or various projects or cycling in welfare so i do n't think it 's entirely `` wasted '' . 
  but spending dozens of billions under the table routinely like in greece or spain or elsewhere definitely start taking it 's toll in the budget . 
   if they dont change their mind they can get left behind , and it 's their own fault . 
  if collecting taxes & not helping crass fraud `` because it helps the economy '' is `` staying behind '' , then we 'll gladly `` stay behind '' from your own pov . 
  because , the inevitable and unavoidable result of tolerating evasion then the following ultra corruption is greece , ukraine and ultra poverty . 
   and the eurozone not killing non-eurozone economies in achieving that . 
  i can understand that much and truly hope we wo n't end up with another situation like greece . 
  that really was an economical disaster . 
   and decisions for the currency should n't apply to non-eurozone members if they do n't want them to . 
  true , that much would be reasonable in a number of cases . 
   clear ? 
  a lot clearer, 
   but there are no explicit protections against the eu as a whole being used to support the ( very real and sensible . . ) needs of the eurozone in a manner that harms the ability of non-eurozone countries to manage their economies and currencies . 
  sorry to be so aggressive , but it reminds me of the russian demands to be `` protected against ukraine joigning the eu '' . 
  the rest of the eu has their own sovereignty that does not and should not be answerable to the uk , sorry . 
  either you are in the eurozone currency area and can pick in for legislation related or , or you are out and you do n't decide for the euro currency policy . 
  you ca n't have it both ways . 
  once again the uk wants all of the rights but none of the chores . 
  they are quite heavily linked . 
  that 's how the congress sabotage everything in the usa : by cutting funds to any and everything with crappy defacto vetos, 
   thats not how tax avoidance works , and i am specifically not talking about corporation tax . 
  i 'm talking about the taxes which they can not avoid or even realistically evade paying such as vat obviously you have n't followed closely since corporations were n't even paying the vat largely since they all declared it as paid abroad like in ireland or luxembourg where it 's about nil ( if not then redeclared behind in bermuda where it 's simply null . ) . 
   and personal income tax . 
  yeah right . 
  they were n't paying that one either . 
   corporation tax makes no sense anyway , it should be abolished . 
  lol . 
  `` helping redistribute some of the colossal wealth corporations with taxes have makes no sense . 
  it 's perfectly normal to have corporations stashing trillions abroad [ while shanty towns are in the rise in the uk because the average worker is less and less likely to be able to afford even housing above their head ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/immigration/10148597/lets-stop-pretending-that-a-shanty-town-in-london-is-a-big-surprise.html ) '' ( because supposedly there is no money left to pay them ) is that it ? . 
  on the other hand that does n't quite answer the question , since the likely possibility in the immediate is that the uk stay . 
  also , the uk have in the draft the concession that they can stay out of an ever closer union no problem . 
  and what would be your interpretation ? 
  i 've heard widely different interpretation of that `` veto '' demand dependant who you ask in the uk and who they think they are talking to . 
  last i heard , the demand was for a veto right blocking eu legislation on uk decision . 
  there 's a couple main groups tho : - saa ( syrian regime , with a lot of iranian and russian help , some afghan and shia militia and hezbollah backing them too ) - fsa ( the `` rebels '' ) . 
  mainly in to fight assad , but also fight daesh when they happen to meet - the islamists radicals hijacking the fsa ( nusra , jaysh al islam , ... ) . 
  al nusra is the most famous of those groups , and currently offered allegience to al qaeda ( yes , that one al qaeda ) . 
  - the sdf ( a coalition where there is a military majority kurd , some former fsa and a lot of locals arabs & assyrians & turkmen aligned with them . 
  the main group supported by western countries and one of the more moderate & reasonable by far . 
  turkey hate them tho because turkey accuse them of supporting the pkk separatist group in southern turkey , with which it is at war . 
  to be fair a lot of the best kurdish fighters in the sdf are * former * pkk , but turkey is still quite aggressive ) they 're neutral toward most other factions apart the islamists/daesh ( the last one being fought on sight ) - daesh ( isis , isil , `` islamist state '' , the well known death cult ) and the foreign powers backing all that : - western countries ( led by the usa and eu ) & coalition , backing mostly the sdf . 
  before that there was some backing for the rebels , but they failed to separate from islamists hard liners in the north ( in fact getting closer and closer ) so they gradually lost support due to that - iran , backing the saa - russia , backing the saa - turkey , backing the islamists and fsa ( and before that isis , but apparently that ceased ) - the gulf council countries ( qatar , saudi arabia , ... ) backing the islamists and a bit the fsa . 
  some nationals from those countries illegally back isis tho and here , aleppo that was in fsa hands is falling in saa . 
  saa is moving from north-east towards north & east aleppo . 
  so the town of aleppo used to be one of the biggest syrian cities , and it is near the border with turkey , so civilians are largely fleeing the combats head toward turkey or idlib ( another big town in rebels/islamists hands south west of aleppo ) . 
  there was an attempt to negociate a peace or cease fire between the rebels and the gov , but mainly the rebels stalled it because they did n't felt like negociating while being on the loosing side , and now they 're loosing aleppo . 
  the sdf and saa are in cease fire . 
  daesh fights everyone . 
  hopes that clarify the whole thing a bit . 
  edit : and here 's a map of who control the area .

  yeah i was thinking similar to trump and his `` maybe the 2nd amendment guys should ... 
  i do n't know ... '', 
  he is careful with his words though : `` one of the interpretations ... '' `` towards the end of times ... there will be wars ... and because of these wars ... '' he 's signalling to these kids that they 'll be able to keep female slaves if they sign up for the end of times jihad , but he 's careful to couch it in conditional or hypothetical terms . 
  the best charge might be conspiracy to recruit and/or engage in terrorist activities , but it will be difficult to prove . 
  i 'm guessing he 's a citizen as article says he was raised in uk . 
  he should be fired by the mosque though , and probably charged though i 'm not sure with what . 
  poor ~ ~ goats ~ ~ sheep . 
  ( imam is based in wales ), 
  am i failing some internet courage test ? 
  let me guess , you 're certified internet courageous . 
  booing athletes is crass , plain and simple . 
  ban all face coverings in public places , including guy fawkes masks ? 
  okay by me if it 's systematic , but protestors lose the possibility to remain anonymous . 
  they may be reputable , but they 're still * experts * ... 
  not much need for punctuation in the legal sector ? 
  join up with ireland !, 
  leaving the eu will have little impact on fishing communities , unless the uk govt abandons quotas altogether , in which case they 'll destroy uk fisheries over 10-15 years in a crazy free for all . 
  ditto the collieries : the eu is not the problem here , it 's the costs involved in extracting coal . 
  we 're left with nissan : i hope the factory stays , but i do n't see how brexit can be a welcome move for nissan . 
  i go into paris for work and almost never get hassled . 
  if i do , it 's by beggars . 
  the racailles do n't worry me . 
  yes i am worried about them but i do n't let them see that . 
  we still visit paris regularly . 
  italy wo n't be a ` casualty ' - renzi might be . 
  he had a security file , but i think he was considered low risk . 
  he condemned the shootings at the time . 
   in reality the risk is minimal . 
  one has more chance of dying in a car accident on our way to a concert or football match than in a terror attack . 
  this ca n't be emphasised too much . 
  the likelihood of being involved in an attack is vanishingly small . 
  also , we all die from something , so living in constant fear is pointless . 
  it 's not . 
  but if this is how they want to dress for swimming , they 're within their rights to do so . 
  i think it 's crazy , but i ca n't complain about a religion that tells women what to wear , while at the same time i 'm telling women what they can and ca n't wear . 
  voluntary sporting association . 
  poor kids . 
  seems the ceiling had polystyrene tiles which caught fire really fast and the fumes rapidly overcame the victims . 
  basements are scarily dangerous when something goes wrong . 
  i lived in lille for five years and this is one of the highlights of the year . 
  i disagree with the decision to close it . 
  edit : never mind - my misunderstanding . 
  i thought this story interesting coming as it does on the heels of the `` burkini '' outcry . 
  again , there 's a commercial issue here that is to be respected - the supermarket is n't licensed as a halal supermarket , it 's licensed as a general supermarket . 
  it needs to respect the terms of its license . 
   europe has the highest online piracy rates , by far europe has the highest online piracy rates , by farrrrrrrr ftfy, 
  turns out you are internationally known , 
  rob base ? 
   the uk police has killed exactly how many minority people in the uk during the past decade ? 
  not many - they 're detailed in the article . 
  the mark duggan killing is noteworthy as it sparked off riots in london and elsewhere . 
  it 's being hired by a sporting association . 
   basements and nearby homes were flooded my basement was flooded with wine while i was down there doing some woodworking . 
  my wife contacted the emergency services and they came to rescue me from the rising tide of wine . 
  but do n't worry , i managed to fight them off . 
  do n't take `` plonk '' as necessarily derogatory . 
  some people use it as a generic term for wine . 
  okay , that was funny . 
  hoping for some gregorian chant . 
  your perception is that they 've closed their open air aquatic park to the public , on a saturday , during one of the top 4/5 months of the year , without ** any ** guarantee of revenue , just a hope to sell tickets ? 
  do you have any evidence to support this ? 
  it sounds very unlikely . 
  i ca n't explain it any more . 
  if you have a jewish glee club , or a protestant wine tasting club , or a pastafarian rpg club , you can hire out a business premises for an event and ** only members of your club ** can attend the event . 
  the premises is yours for the day . 
  the business is not discriminating ; the club is discriminating . 
  it 's not like the gay wedding cake saga at all . 
  it 's not a burka day . 
  the water park agreed to privatise the park for the day . 
  they are not doing it for free . 
  ah here , we 're going full bloody circle . 
  the ** place of business ** is being booked out completely by a club . 
  the club has an exclusive membership policy . 
  the club is taking the entire place for a day . 
  i said this earlier :  it 's not the water park having a `` burkini day '' . 
  it 's the muslim women 's group booking the water park . 
  not sure how many ways this can be explained . 
   another of mr sankari 's friends , diya , said the united nations was also failing to protect the gay community in turkey . 
  i 'm sorry for his loss , but in fairness it should be up to the turkish government to protect the gay community in turkey . 
  what do you mean you ca n't ? 
  you set up a club and only invite white people to join . 
  if a non-white asks to join , you make up some excuse why they ca n't . 
  then you book the water park . 
   that 's actually not clear if they payed to book it . 
  yes it is . 
  you can buy tickets [ here ] ( https://www.billetweb.fr/smile13-a-speed-water ) . 
  if you have a `` whites only club '' then book the place . 
  it 's not the water park having a `` burkini day '' . 
  it 's the muslim women 's group booking the water park . 
  not sure how many ways this can be explained . 
   if they 're going with a female only thing , they should hire some female lifeguards , and dress as they want to , and in a more sporty way . 
  agreed . 
   ` terrorist diaspora ' implies that these terrorists are somehow being created in syria i think he 's referring to guys who want to be in syria to set up their caliphate nonsense but who will be pushed out eventually . 
  so they 'll lose their notional `` homeland '' when the caliphate falls , and come back to europe/elsewhere as terrorists . 
  i 'd be most worried about turkey tbh . 
  not quite sure what you 're trying to say , but if you go to the group 's facebook page ( linked from the article ) , it 's stated there that there will be male lifeguards on duty . 
  most water parks have a mix of lifeguards but probably not enough women to have only women lifeguards working that day . 
   they are both banning men and requiring burkinis . 
  male lifeguards on duty at the water park . 
  do you reckon they have water slides at this park ?

  though if you find one i suggest you create your own telco and make lotsa money !, 
  if your customers want to use netflix but you can only offer them 64kbps , they will become your competitors ' customers fast . 
  so , netflix uses a shit ton of bandwith right ? 
  so more fiber , more platforms are needed right ? 
  so then who has to pay for that ? 
  either you make all customers pay more to increase the capacity , or you make netflix pay ( and they increase their prices accordingly ) and just the people using that service have to pay for it . 
  what is more fair ? 
  that people using the service pay for it , or that everybody pays for it ? 
  let s say there is a waterpark , does it have to pay for its water consumption ( and the costs are passed down to consummers ) or do you make everybody pay a little more ? 
  it 's the same thing , some service providers put strains on the network and should pay more accordingly . 
  obviously you should not throttle netflix to favor your own services ( and that is why we have nras controlling , im all for giving them more oversight power ) , but it makes sense to pass costs onto them . 
   the last mile should be owned by the public utilities and isps should be able to rent it to provide their service . 
  it is a choice that was made in the past ( that the network be built by private companies ) . 
  some countries do it like that ( australia ) and it actually works pretty horribly . 
   adding a few fibers could be done very cheaply no , not cheaply . 
   we could also easily remove the conflict of interest if isps were n't allowed to provide content , like tv . 
  i can never be sure that my isp is n't throttling netflix if they also provide a streaming service . 
  but if they sell only bandwidth in their backbone , they would have no incentive to block any content providers . 
  except those companies are not public bodies , they make the investments , they own the network , not you . 
  you do n't think it is unfair to deny them the use of their own networks to offer services ? 
  is n't it an incentive to invest in better faster network so you can offer better services than your competitor ? 
  btw , those services are an essential part of the business model of telcos , without them , they just do n't have the money to invest in new faster networks . 
  what is the interest in investing in better network if you just `` own the pipes '' . 
  using your water analogy , do water companies or whatever they are called have any desire in offering you higher water pressure or whatever ? 
  no , because they do n't have anything to gain from it . 
  ( i know it 's not a great example , but you see my point ), 
  byebye voice over ip , ip tv , ppv and telemedicine !, 
  seriously , this is gon na get ripped apart , the parliament 's text is practically unapplicable . 
   does this also mean more competition / a fully european market ? 
  is it likely i 'll be able to sign up to a french provider if i live in ireland ? 
  ( i.e. 
  i can have a french mobile number ? ) . 
  no , there is a fair use clause . 
  well , spirits and lifeforce falls under religion to me . 
  according to what you just linked , the eurobarometer says that 40 % of french say they dont believe there is any sort of god spirit or whatever , while 39 % of czech do . 
  no , but even this number is true , we 're a `` big '' country , so it is still a small part of the population . 
  also you do n't need to be religious to hate gays =p, 
  true true . 
  still , very atheist country . 
  yeah , and the same goes for zoroastrianism !, 
  racist i say . 
  probably , france really is atheist . 
  even our far right uses atheism as an argument to discriminate against muslims . 
  nuclear power ftw . 
  hello ms auken . 
  a couple procedural questions that i ca n't seem to understand . 
  as a rapporteur , you receive opinions from the concerned committees . 
  it is my understanding that you have the amendments they propose into consideration when you write your draft report . 
  but then : 1 . 
  how are those opinions handled in committee ? 
  does the committee vote for the block of amendments proposed in the opinion ? 
  for them individually ? 
  or just for the ones you selected ? 
  i noticed that the formal document forwarded to the council contains the opinions , are they just attached to the doc for clarity 's sake ? 
  so there is a sort of consolidated document ? 
  or does it mean they have some sort of use ( for instance to reuse in the second reading ) ? 
  generally i am a bit confused as to what happens to an opinon after it is sent from one committee to the next . 
  from the different texts i 've read they never seem to actually get adopted . 
  is this generally true ? 
  what procedural rule do you think should be changed/modernized ? 
  also , unrelated : 5 . 
  was the draft legislation the one where they had translation problems , which pushed back itre 's connected continent ? 
  if so , what happened ? 
  thanks a lot !, 
  what/why do you mean ? 
  i do n't understand why romania and bulgaria take the opposite approach when they 're pertty much in the same situation . 
  does it have smthg to do with transnistria ? 
  roaming charges are actually to end in 2017 , whether this passes or not . 
  there is already a directive taking care of that . 
  the issue for telcos is that 2 years is an extremely short timetable for such a big change , particularly when the 2009 directive had a different calendar . 
  it is not the case here . 
  actually the council is opposed to this . 
  completely wrong ... do n't invent titles when you do n't know what you are talking about . 
  this just got out of the itre commitee , it will prolly make it out of plenary intact but it will definitively not pass the council . 
  the commitee probably knows this and they want leverage to make a deal with the council . 
  i was editing . 
  well you just ca n't amend the treaties through parliament . 
  the treaties are what is called * primary law * . 
  parliament makes laws that draw their power from the treaties , they are called * secondary laws * . 
  so , eu gov ` ts can sign new treaties , who amend the previous treaties ( which give parliament its power to make secondary law ) , but parliament ca n't make laws that amend the treaties . 
  if you want a parallel think of the american constitution vs laws passed by congress . 
  the only way congress can change the constitution is through a special procedure , the rest of the time the laws it makes have to follow the constitution . 
  the uk system is different , because you do not have `` rankings '' between different laws , so it does n't really work as a comparison . 
  what parliament can do is amend this particular piece of legislation ( the connected continent regulation ) . 
  ps : i 'm sorry if this is all kinda messy . 
  none . 
  1 . you ca n't amend the treaties in parliament ... 2 . to amend the legislation in plenary the amendment would have to be carried by a political group , i do n't think any of them plan to . 
  but i might be wrong on that one . 
  in any case , you would still need to get the votes in the plenary to support the amendment . 
  prolly not gna happen . 
   although i would also , particularly like to know what we can do to exert pressure most effectively it is pretty much too late for the april vote . 
   does it basically come down to whether alde support or oppose ? 
  or is it worthwhile trying to persuade individual members , even if they are epp or ecr ? 
  are they likely to break the party line , or do members usually vote as a bloc under these circumstances ? 
  not really . 
  you pretty much need epp and s&d to agree . 
  it is extremely rare for things to pass when one of the two main parties oppose it . 
  the amendment would just be part of the regulation , just one aspect , even if the amendment were to pass . 
  they would still need to get epp on board , it just never happens that a legislation passes against the will of one of the big two . 
  they really are , see how it is abroad .

  normally , if more jobs cant be created , it 's necessary to replace the oldest workers who are already close to the retirement age , ideally at no penalty for them since young workers they are replaced with will contribute far more over their life to compensate for the cost of providing pensions a year or 2 earlier to beneficiaries . 
  ukrainian men barely live long enough to enjoy retirement . 
  like it or not , europe is heading there , just not by reducing life expectancy . 
  a small specialized army is more easily managed and transported , given how few armed conflicts there are nowadays . 
  uk cant participate in all of those anyway . 
  great , add 3 more years to everyone 's retirement age . 
  all it has to do is install windows 8 on a test machine for everyone to try . 
  officials will ditch that godspeed and find comfort in even gentoo . 
  the leftists have lost their minds sinking ship france , especially the current president 's antics and shady manipulations . 
  no wonder people are voting fn , this shit has got to stop . 
  the recent `` sanction orgy contest '' is a joke that will cost our economy . 
  no serious country will give another look at rafales , after the farce we pulled with mistrals . 
   are there real alternatives on the way ? 
  never if the neonazis acquire nukes . 
  if hitler did , entire planet would be speaking german . 
  he got off easy , they didnt gouge his eyes then hang him and his buddies to lampposts . 
  they got a big problem with immigrants , but this is no way to throw them away en masse . 
  that said , those are blamed for a lot of greece 's problems , if just out of ignorance . 
  it 's easier to scapegoat foreigners who flee the country with whatever wealth they managed to ` smuggle ' out . 
  `` falsely '' ... 
  so , who decides something is false , in the paradise of corruption on earth , and how much does `` proving your innocence '' cost ? 
  report all their posts !, 
  block his pandora account and he 'll sing another tune !, 
  not happening . 
  borders are not viable , it 's really minuscule and depends on good neighbourly relations with its immediate neighbouring nations . 
  as long as it does n't break ties to those or they do n't , it 's under no danger and should focus on its own development . 
  ridiculous . 
  it 's nowhere as bad as pollution in china . 
  look at this site 's other `` news '' and form your own opinion on its credibility . 
  seriously , a scoop how supposedly michelle obama is a tranny ?!, 
  the biggest revelation here is some exist who view this site as a credible source of news . 
  essentially nationalistic fascism , not specially german . 
  it 's more associated with the inhuman practices of such violent regimes and reminds of the sacrifices that were necessary to defeat it . 
  imagine how different today 's world would have been if nazis secured and used atomic weapons just a month before the west or guaranteed the continuation of the 3rd reich thanks to mad . 
  all europe would have needed to go nuclear and spam their territories with defenses . 
  we need these for western electoral campaigns . 
  smiling family : ron paul bloody coffin : obama ( care ), 
  i guess that would send the point across for those 50 old people who cant read ... 
  something tells me its a false flag operation from nsa or affiliated groups , deflecting responsibility to an easily demonized party . 
  all it needs is traffic for command & control servers temporarily redirected to china or russia . 
  military preparedness and spending was never a problem for europe , its surrounded by oceans , friendly nations and weak republics easily controlled using finance , investment and generally economic measures . 
  peaceful democratic rule should still be supported , its the only way to build lasting bridges between otherwise fractured societies . 
  increasing polarization serves noone 's interests in those countries , whose ethnic and economic diversity should be and remain respected . 
  just look at scotland . 
  if things were as rosy as uk pretends , why is it looking to secede , and why is uk doing its best to force it not to , disregarding the people 's vote in advance , whatever it may be leaning toward ? 
  unless russia is claimed to have been behind that secessionism and looking to build military bases there , there 's no changing the people 's will . 
  what would the uk do if it secede after all , blockade it and surround it with tanks , submarines and sam , inflicting death or bankrupcy to anyone who dares establish friendly ties with it ? 
  escalating tensions by polarizing society into enemy factions is still not the way to handle such situations . 
  all this posturing is shownig crimeans is kiev being a major threat to their rights and now security , so definitely not the way to win their minds or hearts . 
  kinda telling ( and sad ) that they feel safer with russia 's shield than kiev . 
  europe needs more diplomatic engagement to defuse crisises , not warmongering hawks . 
  its stubbornness gave us 2 world wars already , enough of that partisan hardheaded shit . 
  any politician only concerned about himself mainly ( ` not looking weak ' ) should leave office , that kind of selfcentered people have not the kind we need to prevent or defuse conflicts . 
  ridiculous . 
  looks like an attempt at vilifying the company so concerned parties claim it supports disappropriation of victims . 
  extortion using reputations held as hostage basically . 
  they 're now in control of the police and arsenals , what 's the worst that could happen to anti-democracy treasonous insurgents blocking streets in protests ? 
  false flag operations as usual , blitz-blaming authorities until the most honest/least corrupt resign or are overpowered . 
  didnt stop the nazis from rising back when they burned the reichtag and blamed in on the communists , in dark times when facebook promoted stories , twitter and photoshop didnt exist . 
  i 'm sure there exist some actually positive about it and not worried the east and south may follow and take their toys , factories and lands with them ... more seriously , if i had to speculate , positive sentiment about it would likely be a realization if unity is ( made ) impossible under the current regime , a clean separation may be the best option . 
  the imf will bleed ukraine dry like greece in short order . 
  fascists are indeniably a big problem . 
  not sanctioning them or keeping them away of power decredibilises the current regime , especially when they blatantly threaten entire elected offices under duress into either voting things their way or mass resignations ` or else ' , and handing off governorates to oligarchs does nothing to curb corruption and the mingling of big money with politics , with hated oligarchs just getting replaced by other oligarchs . 
  a somewhat neutral article from * western media * , with no cold war hysteria or warmongering ? 
  now i 've seen everything . 
  i was referring to when things normalized for the bloc around 2000 , the difficult times before and right after the fall of the soviet union are well documented in comparison . 
  that was more of a trend i noticed in general with ex-soviet countries , not specific to poland ( skilled labour underpaid in their country , moving to western countries , perpetuating low wages inside the original country ) . 
  the countries themselves may be holding out , but average ludmilla 's situation is not improving as steadily to keep up with inflation . 
  it 's become a worldwide trend now , but in most western countries workers had a more significant safety net or better base salaries more suitable for fending off rainy days . 
  western-style democracy doesnt work in europe , for ex-soviet countries ( elections are fine , but the post-2000 uncontrolled capitalist globalization is tearing countries apart ) . 
  just look at poland 's example , it 's seen as just a source of very cheap labour , and despite the country 's ` economic miracle ' , its population 's situation is rock-bottom bad and barely changed . 
  first to blame : removal of the social net , deposession of its industries and companies by a west eager to acquire them ( definitely will happen to ukraine ) , which will worsen the situation for the workforce . 
  and that 's not even getting into the eu integration 's crazy conditions . 
  some : massive devaluation of the currency , removal of a lot of social protection measures , privatization of a large part of state-owned companies whose operation by the state is what kept them from collapsing ( think of uk 's rail system as example , its falling apart after the gov sold it to greedy vultures ) , requirement to take large loans with high interests if late repaid ( see greece , it 's definitely happening to ukraine all the same expect sooner , greece just delayed the inevitable and now struggles to just repay the interest , imposing inhumane levels of austerity on its population . 
  i have skilled , well-employed friends there whose plight would make statues shed hot tears , and are considering fleeing to * anywhere * that is n't called greece or north korea ) . 
  all sides should help ukraine economically in a honest manner instead of trying to polarize the society into a `` with us or against us '' manner . 
  kinda sad seeing populations ' desire for change being hijacked to start a new cold war . 
  all the current ex-rebel leaders have pasts just as embarassing . 
  what should shock is their histories and infighting before the last election were so bad yanukovich * managed * to win as the lesser evil . 
  this happened after both sides agreed to participate in a discussion group , so likely us , to drive a wedge between russia and germany ( for whom ties with russia are more important in the longterm than this month 's ephemereal posturing ) , if the call 's content was even genuine ( to cause apprehensions in the opposing party , who may question merkel 's honesty during a negociation ) . 
  on an aside , it 's not called leaking or wiretapping if us politicians were part of the phone conversation they shared with the world !, 
   he may indeed take all of ukraine . 
  not a chance , it 'd be a major liability with its economy barely holding together with wires and duct tape . 
  it 'd also perpetuate polarization of its society instead of reducing tensions . 
  improving the economy/spending power mainly , and improving justice/reducing corruption . 
  essentially everyone moved on hope for change , breaking the stalemate about matters important to the population . 
  social justice may be difficult to attain given the hysteria-fed polarization of the situation since december . 
  they actually agreed , and nothing but the malice of agent provocateurs wouldve kept the riots going . 
  the ` pro-eu ' side did not respect its engagements twice now , initially the day before blood was shed then when yanukovitch 's car was shot at in a visible assassination attempt . 
  he 's still a corrupt politician , but the pro-eu ones are no better and were chased of power before him all the same . 
  right now what is necessary is to restore the rule of law , which means riots have to stop or be stopped , with all and any parties responsible for their continued obstruction of the public infrastructure brought to justice . 
  too late , the damage is done . 
  their colors have been shown , it 's clear the new faces will only be biding their time to persecute anyone who disagrees with them , once the media is either subverted or the topic dies down . 
  either way , `` unity '' wont be happening if the agreements signed are not enacted and all parties reached out to without prejudice or malice like when the language law was repealed out nothing more than spite by lawmakers clearly abusing their affectation and no longer deserving to serve in office or to be trusted with lawmaking and voting legislation . 
  the eu is fast becoming the new soviet union ... 
  they 'll only hand control after the wehrmacht occupies athens again and appoints yes-men as governors . 
  it 's also called `` they 're your fcking problem now '' diplomacy . 
   problem with that is that a country like turkey is economically , politically and socially incapable of taking in four million refugees . 
  so are the 3/4 of the european union ... 
  if germany wants to welcome refugees , it better put its money where its mouth is and fly them to berlin from their home countries and the ` first safe country ' .

trump uses sexist language extremely frequently , repeatedly called mexicans rapists and criminals , and is even better than this sub at discrimination against muslims . 
  outside of his actual agenda ( of which we know very little of since it changes depending on what he had for breakfast that day ) , i think it 's not hard nor unfair to call him a bigot even though cruz was probably worse . 
  oh and i fail to see how a flat tax for businesses and individuals will `` create opportunities '' for everyone and not just benefit the wealthiest . 
  `` yeah , the illiberal liberals logic , if a muslim woman wears a burka it is by choice , if a german woman bakes a cake it is sexism . '', 
  `` you need to look from a different angle : blond = nazi woman bakes cake = sexism = nazi having a shotgun = militarist = nazi tradional german attire = conservative = nazi '' `` that the media in germany are against anything that remotely resembles nationalism is not exactly newsworthy . '', 
  `` it depicts german people who are at ease with being german . 
  apparently this is bad . '', 
  all of those comments have at least 50 upvotes and they show a real bias in favor of imaginary traditions and a fantasmed past . 
  that 's what i would define as right-wing comments in this context . 
  it 's this kind of right-wing ( social conservatism and nationalism ) that is proeminent here , not the economic right . 
  my bias is n't very strong , you could put me to the left but i do n't have any real political affiliation . 
  alternatively , your own bias is so strong that you ca n't even see it 's widespread , even in a thread with so many good examples of that . 
  i 'm afraid there is n't much i can do for you . . 
  it 's not up to me , just look at this thread and any other and at what it mostly upvoted and downvoted , it 's fairly obvious what this sub 's bias is . 
  i 'm not making up anything , / r/europe is the definition of an echo chamber and would be even worse without the efforts from mods . 
  any post about immigration , far-right parties or anything even remotely relevant to that matter is utterly dominated by right-wing comments . 
  there are of course others , but the vast majority of the voting and commenting part of this sub is right-wing and very conservative ( the `` what 's wrong with this ? '', 
  comments on this thread being a nice example ), 
  remember we 're on / r/europe , anything that is n't neo-nationalist reactionarism is liberal scum, 
  i do n't know a lot about the situation at hand , but aside from politics , paralyzing a constitutionnal court and not respecting its ruling seems like a very big deal in terms of democracy and something that goes against your constitution, 
   they would be stoning gays , killing witches , and murdering atheists too . 
  because that 's what your everyday practicing muslim does in a `` modern '' society ( which would ethnocentrically be defined as a democratic political system with a production-based economy and individual freedoms ) ? 
  of course not . 
  however they use parts of the qu ` ran to form their worldview , as do people who vote for people who speak about `` god-given rights '' ( hello ted cruz ) and believe homosexuality and abortion are sins . 
  after the beautiful failure that was the removal of nationality earlier this year , we face once again an useless debate prompted by a pm who does n't actually care about the terrible state of our universities . 
  as an uni student , i find it ridiculous to be debating on that when we 've got huge problems with university funding , post-graduate research , student councelling , dropouts , post-uni unemployment and all the other issues regarding universities that actually impact people 's lifes ( not only students in the long term ) in a way more concrete way but are mostly ignored by politicians who could n't care less . 
  but of course , adults wearing headscarves if they wish to is way more important ... 
  did i say they do ? 
  i 'm pretty sure ted cruz would disagree, 
   seriously now , how many people actually take the bible seriously in modern societies ? 
  you ever heard of the republican party in the us ? 
  you realize the csu was the most to the right party in germany before afd ? 
  so peace , prosperity and freedom , or at least the legal framework that allows them become afterthoughts ? 
   then you 're either really innocent or have very poor imagination . 
  okay i 'm going to precise : going back on it without pogroms/genocide or whatever atrocity . 
  since you seem to seek a consensus solution , i assumed that was out of the picture in a rational debate . 
  but since you 'd rather `` kill it and count the bodies afterward '' , i 'm not sure how this consensus is possible . 
  if one side makes irrealistic propositions ( ending `` multiculturalism '' which implies authoritarian methods that can lead to very dangerous outcomes ) , i 'm not sure how you can expect to find a middle ground . 
  about the terrorism claim , [ i 'll just leave that here ] ( https://d28wbuch0jlv7v.cloudfront.net/images/infografik/normal/chartoftheday_4093_people_killed_by_terrorist_attacks_in_western_europe_since_1970_n.jpg ) . 
  i know the media always amplifies fears as it sells stories , but it 's not so bad . 
  and i say that living in a city where 147 people were killed last year because of terrorism . 
  it 's still less than how many people are killed every months on the roads , every week of cancer ... as for the radicalization , it 's arguably a fallacy if you speak in general terms ( culturally muslim youths ) , more of a mix of poor socio-economic and religious policy problem on actual radicalization ( between the lack of funding leaving an open door for saudi radicals and the lack of economic opportunities and social support to the repeat offenders problem leading to radicalization in prison ) . 
   who said anything about armed conflict between european nations ? 
  oh my bad i thought that was what you were talking about amongst other stuff . 
  of course you can discuss practical issues but i think that when trying to predict the future there is always some philosophy involved , as well as history and sociology . 
  and i do not think that in the current state of political opinions in europe a compromise where `` everyone gets more of what they need '' is possible . 
  for instance , i do n't even think that the so-called ` multiculturalism ' is not something you can really go back on , notably because it has ( to my understanding of european history which might differ from yours ) always kind of been a thing , and the revolutions of transport and communication ( sounds very clich\u00e9 i know ) only reinforce it . 
  i do think that the social norms both in the national and international scene have been internalized by most political actors to an extent , which can provide the necessary bareer to avoid the breakdown of the rule of law even if extremist parties gain traction . 
  saying we are set for a century of terrorism seems preposterous to me as well , as for the social unrest i do believe that good governance can quieten it , even though it 's maybe too optimist seeing the current state of the ruling class . 
  but since you are talking about practical issues , how for instance would you go about solving the islamism and refugee crisis without destroying constitutionnal and international principles that allow us to live in this era of relative peace , prosperity and freedom ? 
  once you start disregarding those , you are on a slippery slope and there is no telling where it ends . 
  those are something quite unique that modern democratic societies have , and i think letting that go would be a huge mistake . 
  i do think that armed conflict between nation-states in europe is very unlikely to occur again in any reasonable timeframe . 
  of course that 's not much more an opinion based on the international relationships theory to which i subscribe the most ( constructivism ) , i ca n't actually predict the future and it 's true that right now it feels like the 30s in some way but i still think both perceived national interests and an actual shared political belief that cooperation and diplomacy is the way to go ( even though it 's put under quite some strain right now ) means that europe is durably pacified . 
  intra-societal conflicts are something else though , but i 'm not sure that the current wave of pitting people one against another for political profit from the extremes and increasingly from mainstream parties will make this any better . 
  if the solutions approved by the majority of people contrevenes basic principles , there are judicial safeguards in place to protect those principles like echr or national constitutionnal courts depending on their prerogatives . 
  if those fail , we 're set for another wave of authoritarian regimes i guess . 
  rousseau said the law should know no boundaries because the people ca n't oppress themselves . 
  well i think history has shown us that that 's bullshit , especially in times of fear , and i really hope that national and european institutions will continue to remember it too despite some popular pressure . 
  anyway that 's my opinion , i see where yours is coming from but i think there really is no end to this debate because it 's almost a philosophical matter , one about political philosophy at least and about the human nature at most . 
   at least the other side is willing to put forth ideas yeah but look at those ideas though . 
  having sensible discussion with some people on the `` other side '' of this debate ( which i like doing ) is different from calling out bullshit like `` just drop them over the atlantic with parachutes '' or `` let 's profile every muslim in europe '' . 
  of course we need solutions that a majority of people can get behind , but we need those solutions to conform to some basic principles and laws , and not being racist ( or `` islamophobe '' whatever , to me saying it 's not racist is like saying anti-semitism is n't racist , it 's semantics and i find it very debatable ) the thing is that populists from all over europe have exploited the fears created by recent events and global lack of agenda from national and european institutions to make people believe that complex problems have very simple solutions like to close borders or here to strip radical imams of their nationality , and they have done this so deeply that even steps that should be considered progress , like the turkey deal , are frowned upon by many . 
  so yeah , i 'm not anymore sure that we can find an actual solution to this problem in the short term . 
  in the long term , i still think nationalists are going to be the ones who are going to be more disappointed because to me this way of analyzing events is outdated and deculturation is just how the world is evolving . 
  i do understand where they 're coming from though . 
  anyway , i know that plenty of people here are n't racist , and i know some are without realizing it themselves . 
  but this sub has turned into a circlejerk and i think it 's dangerous and that it is felt in the low quality of debates because circlejerk = polarization have a nice day, 
  what did you expect this is / r/europe it 's like / r/the _ donald but with less memes, 
   profile muslim people  fears of appearing racist `` i 'm afraid my racism is going to be considered racist '' edit : `` thankfully this sub is as racist as me so it 's all good '', 
   no where in the world do they kill people in the name of a fake god . 
  death to apostates , death to homosexuals , oppression of women , oppression of children - all dictated by fictional book wtf man you 're just proving my point . 
  the stupid teens in the video are thugs , not terrorists . 
  stop assimilating any fucking brownish people you see with salafism . 
  that 's what your prejudice is about . 
  you see arab looking teens with guns , you think isis . 
  but this does happen elsewhere without having anything to do with religion . 
  and i 'm not talking about terrorism , that does happen too elsewhere but that 's not what this video and our conversation is about . 
   you 've been in fucking france too long . 
  is the country that far fucking lost ? 
  aside from a shitty economy and an authoritarian pm with a sleeping president we 're fine thanks for asking . 
   no wonder you 're a fucking moron . 
  you 're brainwashed also right . 
  your political opinions are from what i 've seen a giant circlejerk of emptyness and prejudice , and you lack the awareness to see the blatant flaws and contradictions in what you 're saying . 
  but sure , i 'm a brainwashed idiot if that can help you sleep at night . 
  and yeah i 've read most of the report , nowhere are the made-up figure in the bullshit but very common chart you provided . 
  you just see in it what you like to see because your confirmation bias is huge , but that 's okay , you 're not alone in this sub if that can comfort you . 
  anyway it 's getting tiring trying to answer your nonsense so i 'll call it a day here . 
  i do not have religious viewpoints myself , i 'm a convinced atheist from a culturally catholic family , but there is a simple concept called tolerance that makes it so that we do n't butcher whole populations based on their beliefs . 
  your prejudice is n't about the fact that these people are 14 and have guns , that is a normal prejudice to have . 
  but this shit happens elsewhere where social structures are lacking . 
  it happens in american ghettos , it happens in south-american favelas from even a younger age and it 's horrible , and it happens there without anything to do with islam . 
  but here , since these ones look `` middle eastern '' , you just assume they are isis supporters because some guy who seemingly shares your viewpoint titled their video this way despite there being no indication whatsoever that they are in fact isis supporters . 
  and there is a very simple name for making that mental link , and it 's called racism . 
   if you think it 's ok for brainwashed people to be living in 2016 then you are part of the problem not the solution so what should we do then ? 
  exterminate all muslims ? 
  make up a law that says muslims ca n't be european nationals ? 
  those laws have existed , if you just switch jews and muslim . 
  as for that graph , i 'm interested to see if you can actually find it in the real pew report ( spoiler : you ca n't ) , which paints a much more nuanced picture than you would like it to , and does n't actually analyze the whole of islam since it only covers coutries where islam is either dominant or represents a very big minority . 
  http://www.pewforum.org/files/2013/04/worlds-muslims-religion-politics-society-full-report.pdf it makes for an interesting read and shows the importance of institutionnal and social parameters on beliefs .

  the article should have compared the numbers to other countries . 
  the article does n't give the age of the emigrants either . 
  it 's pure guessing , the article is basically saying `` it fits well in our mind so it has to be true '' . 
  the real question is how many people in other countries are leaving too ? 
  the number of people moving from one country to another has increased a lot in the whole world , france is no exception . 
  before crying wolf , it 's better to analyze what is really going on . 
  the whole article gives the impression that americans do n't think before going in war and that they are currently saying : `` holy shit !, 
  the french use their brain and their past experience before going to war !, 
  we could never have thought of this alone ! '' . 
  ( no drama intended ^ c , it 's just a satire of the article ), 
  that 's up to opinions , but i would prefer to see asterix having new comics with new subjects , while still respecting the style , than to put it in a museum . 
  i guess vitalstatistix ( the village chief ) will deny him asylum in the village . 
  sarkozy is the president who made the mistral deal in the first place . 
  then , we need the confirmation for this , and next we have to see what ships we are talking about . 
  if those are coast guard ships or fisher ships , who cares ? 
  i have just read the wikipedia page , there is a part of what you said , but also the idea that those colours were already used in other components of the french state ( blue comes from the marine for example ) . 
  it 's more a mix of influence and of initiative which then had been interpretated as the king with people around ( by the way that does n't make sense since the king would still have been superior to the people ) . 
  it 's not a guy locked in a room who decided to put a white band in the middle of the colours of paris . 
  in 1792 , french cartoonists were in strike so they took the flag of netherlands and put it on the side .

  with the risks they took , it 's unlikely they are n't real refugees . 
  1 i do n't read french press a lot , but from what i saw from google news lately , they are more interested in clash between 2 politicians than in serious matters . 
  2 valls have an image of being a man with a hand of steel , but that does n't really mean anything in politics 3 in france , president  minister , president  prime minister , president  god . 
  valls and hollande are from the same party , and even if the government was n't from the same party , the president has the upper hand on decisions . 
  the only scenario to counter balance the power of the president is a legislative warfare from the national assembly .

  if uk leaves all eu-related institutions , i will grab my pop-corn because : - [ scotland will push for another referendum and probably become independent ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/economics/11666560/brexit-referendum-will-trigger-another-scotland-independence-vote-warns-jp-morgan.html ) - tariffs to france ( only road to continent ) and to netherlands ( most important eu commercial harbours ) will be brought back - it wo n't solve any immigrant problem, 
  schengen does n't apply to refugees . 
  it 's the handling at the political scale by the eu which is faulty at the moment . 
  make your own thereg title :  nuclear reprisals ahead : american babyfoot champion beaten in world cup final by italian competitor, 
  you are either genuinely stupid , a troll or a middle school pupil . 
  to make you understand : un has around 200 members . 
  15 of them are members of the security council of un , among which 5 of them are permanent members . 
  same for nato . 
  france never left nato and always fulfilled its duties as an allie : nato is primarily a diplomatic and military alliance for defense : i scratch your back , you scratch mine . 
  in which there is an integrated military command members can decide to join or not , to improve communications but decrease their control . 
  thanks for confirming what i said . 
  get your facts straight , france never left nato . 
  they left the integrated command center to take back full control on its armies . 
  i am a bit doubtful about the last battles . 
  yeah sure , france took part in some bombings . 
  does that mean they fought in every single battle in iraq ? 
  i do n't think so . 
  french `` managers '' too . 
  france is one of the country with the worst inter-professional communication : employees see their employers as their enemies ... but the employers see the employees as the people they have to abuse as much as possible . 
  there is no such thing as company culture of cooperation in france , it 's all on the balance of power . 
  employers are n't better than the employees , they just look more cool . 
  an example : `` if someone does n't have a rolex at 50 yo , he is a failure . '', 
  in a perfect society , free speech should be total . 
  but we have dumb people , easily manipulated people , uneducated people . 
  and those people can actually be influenced by hate speech and commit crimes . 
  the balance is hard to put , and it will always be contested , but it has to be done to limit the spread of hate and of the feeling of impunity . 
  i remember a debate i had while in college and i killed the opponent debate team ( which was in favor of total free speech ) with one argument : `` why did you agree to set up rules for the discussion ? 
  that 's because you have yourself implicitly admitted that those rules were necessary to have a sane debate . '', 
  and that 's exactly the same for reddit and for the real life . 
  government sees new technologies as a roman would see a car : he would try to use horses to move the car . 
  though they do n't understand anything at it , they understood it 's a new market which is exploding so there are some financial help for the companies and they did n't vote any law against video games . 
  i think americans bind their life with money waaay too much , and sees it as normal while it 's dangerous for themself . 
  for example , having to take a loan to get a diploma forces you to work , whatever happens . 
  you are pushed to think individually to pay your loan and be ready to accept a lot more , while the tax system gives more freedom to europeans . 
  i read too many stories of american citizens who were good workers which family went bankrupt because someone got ill or had an accident . 
  i find this astonishing because us argument is in general : `` if you are poor , that 's your fault . '', 
  until they have an accident and see all the doors closing because of the same argument , but it 's already too late . 
  by the way , a very important distinction to do about freedom : there are 2 types of freedom : the right to do it and the ability to do it . 
  the question is to find the good balance , and , if european model is probably a bit too much in favor of ability , the american model is really , really way too much in favor of the rights , letting your lower class unable to fight back and have a decent life . 
  bombing those more or less pro-western groups could lead nato to increase their help to these groups . 
  nato would be very happy to see the russians stuck in another quagmire . 
  that was a caricatural presentation to show how easily the way history is taught in france can skip over important local events which are necessary to understand the current situation in those places . 
  no need to make a course . 
  you forgot the snow in winter and the breaking investigation in an artisanal factory of chairs . 
   the universal values of the french revolution : liberty , democracy and peace there is a little misconception about french revolution being peaceful . 
  there is such a huge part of french history which is n't taught in french schools . 
  nope . 
  french repression in algeria ( before the war ) and in madagascar ? 
  nope . 
  kanak independentist movement ? 
  nope . 
  second republic ? 
  nope . 
  7 years war ? 
  nope . 
  caricatural french history taught at school : there were greeks , then roman , then we directly jump to 100 years war , one word about crusades , then straight to `` louis xiv is too much badass '' . 
  then revolution depicted only as a big war . 
  then we got fucked during ww1 , then we got fucked in wwii , then we got fucked in indochina , then we got fucked in algeria . 
  then ussr got fucked in 1991 . 
  context ? 
  slight difference ? 
  nobody has time for that !, 
  just to set something clear . 
  islam was n't the main topic in french suburbs . 
  those suburbs were filled in the 60 's with mostly algerian immigrants and few french workers who were working in the booming car factories . 
  there was a very strong influence of communism in those areas . 
  those areas were ok as long as the french economy was booming , which stopped in 70 's . 
  islam was a side-subject , while reject/opposition was based on supposed racism from police , very high unemployment , criminal gangs and drug traffic . 
  islam came back as an important matter in those suburbs in the last years .

  i mean , troyes is in champagne , not far from reims where the french kings were crowned . 
   are being fed up a new president every five years yeah that 's called elections \\ ^ ^, 
  naaah , a true frenc accent would be `` ee-ou av tou kutte ze pa ** rrr ** t '' with a very strong french `` r '' , like a spanish `` j '' or german `` ch '', 
  we like you too , your cuisine is wonderful ( and i confess , at least equal to ours , maybe even better ), 
  a few times it is german , such as in a futurama episode where french is a dead language . 
  i 'm not sure i 'm on board with that ... ( wait , did he say lorraine , not alsace ? ), 
  go on , take it !, 
  i would be british so oh hell no, 
  what was it about ?

  that last one is so hardcore . 
  you apparently did n't see my flair , because you bothered with a translation , 
  nah , if anything trump is more liek a mix of cheminade and asselineau ( which luckily are both irrelevant ), 
  as much as i disagree with his politics , chirac was always a trat to watch !,

  i 've only got the french flag because there 's no breton one , so you 'd better prepare for haesteinn of nantes !, 
  mostl , it is because the clich\u00e9d british accent when speaking french and the real british accent when speaking french are completely differend , and the second one sounds a bit like a clich\u00e9d german accent sometimes, 
  we really need to repare this leak before the deus vult leaks too . 
  it feels like a betrayal but ... 
  i actually agree with you, 
  fucking nailed it . 
  the perfidious albion !, 
  well there 's football, 
  considering its position near the leftist stronghold that is britanny , and the general french attitude about trump , which is a mix of disgust , disdain , incredulity and fear , probably arond 90 % -10 % for hillary, 
  absolutely haram, 
  in french , bohemian means `` gypsy '' , and `` la vie de boh\u00eame '' is the phrase dor a poor life . 
  get ready for the stereotypes !, 
  there is edmond in french, 
  not really , most breton names are distinct : gwen , tugdual , gweltas ... 
  yah , you got a point . 
  frnace is historically catholic , and yet the most ( or maybe second most ) atheist country in europe , with more than half the population being nonbeleivers . 
  it 's just a big , big room , with waaay too many locks on the door . 
  but us ? 
  how can you forget the oldest rivalry in history ? 
  we are nothing without eachother !, 
  to me , the dems would be center , center left . 
  they are economically liberal , but very progressive socially , while the republicans would rank between `` hard '' right , as we call it in frnace ( socially conservative , ultraliberal , \u00e0 la thatcher , reagan or fillon ) , to the outright fascist . 
  really , i think that in europe , the republicans would be categorized as far-right , even further than front national , for example . 
  but they killed the v\u00e9n\u00e8tes !, 
  i say celtic france ftw . 
  i do n't know about other languages , but in french , `` bretagne '' , is both the word for britain and britanny , a region of france . 
  as a result , we often say grande-bretagne , streesing the `` grande '' , to be sure we do n't talk about `` petite '' bretagne, 
  nope , hollandais is for the people of hollande ( like breton for the people of britanny ) , and n\u00e9erlandais for the people and language of the netherlands ( like fran\u00e7ais is both the language and people of france ) . 
  why are you only targeting females ? 
  ( just joking , i believe you meant `` parisians '' , `` parisiennes '' is specifically the women living in paris ), 
  ally with germany , defeat lux , belgium , iltaly and switzerland pretty easily , m\u00f4aco and andorra immediatly surrender , we invade spain after along war ( and possibly nuke madrid ) , and then we take on the perfidious albion, 
  alexandre dumas , basically the first commercial author ever , he wrote ( among other things ) two books which have cult status in france : * the three musketeers * and * the count of monte-cristo * ( which is the best book ever , by the way ),

  i can name one : jacques cheminade 2017, 
  bruh he will say all europeans are gunless cucks anyway, 
   standing in the way of corsican independence is not a smart move . 
  well , someone has to bail the island out at some point  i do n't see the issue me neither  though i suspect danes or swedes are more likely to annex normandy . 
  naah , if anything , the normands are as annoying as the enlgish , from my point of view . 
  they will fit nicely . 
  france and poland srround germany too . 
  besides , the last time the germans tried to unite all coutries bordering them in one countries , it did not end that well . 
  hum hum . 
  breton law should be french mate . 
  yours is briton law . 
   independent normandy . 
   independent brittany . 
  immediately , corsica is sold to itlay , while britanny entres into a war with normandy about mont saint michel , which is their rightful territory . 
  both are ruined . 
  britanny is annexed in ireland ( celtic union ftw ) , while the british annex normandy for old time 's sake . 
   celtic people group join ireland then, 
  pretty uncommon , most people have a standard frnehc accent ( i think it is from tours ) . 
  the exception being some experts on the tv and some politicans having a marseille accent . 
  thar really whiny and nasal accent from some parisian upper class people tho ... `` hon ouaaaiiis tu vois ... '', 
  brb gon na steal a nice italian lady . 
  brest as well , for the same reasons as le havre . 
  aaah , the best comedic movie ever !, 
  that would work in french too !,

  we do not really have one big problem , more like many instances of people clashing with migrants , fueling the anger of the fn ? 
  whoc rafted the narrrative of immigration being the problem . 
   really ? 
  i mean , spanish has th and kh sounds , neither catalan or portuguese have them . 
  catalan and portuguese have sh and zh sounds . 
  spanish does n't . 
  catalan and portuguese weaken non tonic ( stressed ) vowels ( a little bit like french does ) , spanish does n't . 
  yeah , but what i tried to say is that although i understand spanish to an extent , i can not tell apart catalanand portuguese,

  i do n't think we 're that bad though , but perhaps i lack perspective . 
  however , to me , self-interest in everyday life , like running red lights , does n't have much to do with a sense of superiority , which we 're accused of . 
  stereotypes of french people , or parisians , being rude however , i 'm fine with and wo n't argue against it . 
  i think there 's a cultural misunderstanding factor in there , but overall that stereotype does n't bother me at all because i feel there 's some truth to it in general . 
  wrong : the french do n't have an innate sense of superiority over the us , or britain . 
  sure , we do think some of our products are better ; like any other country , we acknowledge we have some particular specialties . 
  that 's more of an objective truth than anything else . 
  but overall , the french are profoundly self - ~ ~ depreciating ~ ~ deprecating , whereas americans are the ones who debate about being `` number 1 '' or `` the best country in the world '' . 
  no frenchman in his right mind would ever be caught saying this . 
  i say this through experience of course , i mean in france we know we 're self-deprecating , but most [ polls ] ( http://assets.pewresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2011/11/2011-values0010.png ) on this sort of subject will tend to agree with what i 'm saying . 
  i guess i 'm just kind of sick of this stereotype , especially coming from americans of all people , because i feel it 's very untrue , and it applies more to the people who accuse us of it . 
  edit : self-deprecating , not depriciating, 
  that 's called a `` benevolent dictatorship '' , or historically one could talk of an `` enlightened despot '' - many countries which ended up with a `` good '' monarch at some point in their history . 
  it 's a risky dice role though . 
  but as you implied , it 's only `` benevolent '' to those who agree with the course of the dictatorship 's policy . 
  so there 's something subjective about it , though granted , by definition a benevolent dictator seeks to improve the lives of his people as a whole . 
   she ate three eggs per day , two raw in the morning and then an omelette at noon who makes a one-egg omelette ? 
  yeah , i hope / u/ego _ non just made a typo . 
  if any king of france is famous , it 's louis xiv , who elevated france to the height of its military and cultural power in europe , not the one who was guillotined . 
  that 's how europe is divided in my risk edition , and yes , that area is called `` ukraine '' . 
  one may wonder though if russia could maintain its unity , and hold on to its diverse republics , if it were a peaceful and open country . 
  perhaps that 's partly why it ca n't make that transition . 
  pretty good documentary i guess . 
  burger king left because they were n't successful enough , and it then became popular after they had gone . 
  do n't ask me why . 
  yes !, 
  as a frenchman , whenever i travel to another european country with friends , we eventually go to a burger king :p it 's a big thing in france . 
  kind of a running joke . 
  to the extent that i remember an add for the eurostar which boasted that a burger king was only 2 hours away from paris ... in london . 
  yeah . 
  not to mention much of kosovo being `` albanian '' is due to late migrations . 
  that 's why the albanian nationalist saying this :  the national union of kosovo and albania is an indisputable right of the albanian people , who were unjustly divided by history kind of makes me chuckle . 
  yeah , but it 's not like france does n't have enough rural training ground . 
  the french foreign legion trains in french countryside for god 's sake . 
  ( not trying to insult . 
  i 'm french ), 
  what the . . ? 
  the fuck are french agents spying around , or training ( article not precise ) in rural bulgaria of all places . . ? 
  sure , but european politicians are sensible to their countries ' public opinions , and often adapt their discourse and actions accordingly - including for supporting or opposing turkey 's membership . 
  sarkozy for example was for it , then during his presidential campaign was against it ( because most french were ) and he `` promised '' to oppose it by any means necessary under his watch ... now i do n't know if just one person , even if president of a strong eu country , has the power to stop such processes if the candidate country qualifies . 
  perhaps through vetos . 
  in many independence movements the youth is often strong for the simple reason that old people fear change , they fear their retirement may suffer from a change of that magnitude . 
  it was similar in quebec for example . 
  the article speaks of ( non catalan ) spanish migrants to catalonia ... 
  i thought the napping in the middle of the day thing was weird too . 
  and then i went to spain in summer , and i slept during mid-day like everyone else . 
  in french , when we 're too lazy to say `` r\u00e9publique tch\u00e8que '' , we say `` tch\u00e9quie '' ( pronounced `` czecky '' ) . 
  i 'm guessing it 's the same for the english `` czechia '' ... kind of a drag to have to say `` czech republic '' all the time . . :p, 
  i 'd be willing to pay more taxes for the space program . 
  maybe we can cut taxes for truly useless things , like politicians ' accumulating salaries for example . 
  this has always been the case . 
  in france , and specifically paris , the hooligan movement was actually started by the first skinhead `` gangs '' who were inspired by the english . 
  we need to encourage people to procreate . 
  this can be done in several ways : through `` propaganda '' methods , but also by facilitating parenthood in its different aspects ( more available nurseries and free after school nurseries in public schools , easier parenthood leaves in jobs , perhaps more generous tax benefits per children . . etc. . ) . 
  it 's pretty common for eurosceptic meps to have low attendance . 
  i 'm not justifying it of course , it 's just common practice for these guys and i kind of get it . 
  they think the eu is a farce and thus have little motivation to participate in it . 
  holy shit , those are fucking terrible . 
  regardless of the acting , someone needs to be humanitarian and fucking give these nigerian directors one year in a decent film school !, 
  i 'm not surprised . 
  swedish immigrants in france are also the cause of most of the crime . 
  what a barbaric people , 
  yeah , i make shit up . 
  i 've never seen a muslim in my life , except every single day i wake up . 
  truth is , i sometimes caught myself defending muslims when i hear americans , who know fuck all about them , talk bullshit . 
  in parallel , i do n't hesitate to criticize the religion for what it is , and the people who identify as muslims for what they do . 
  i also criticize christianity when there 's an open opportunity . 
  but i tend to do it less often because it 's simply too easy and widespread , while muslims get too much slack from good-intentioned commentators . 
  do n't bother . 
  he 's a typical leftist scandinavian who lives in fantasy land where muslims and other immigrants are nicey victims of meanies . 
  i 'd love to see him hang around in the neighborhoods i grew up in in the paris suburbs . 
  give him a nice reality check and a little view of what sweden will be like outside of malm\u00f6 in 10 years . . 
  bravo . 
  today you learned that not everyone in a given country corresponds to the general stereotype , be it good or bad , that you give it . 
  not all french are pro-gay , pro-abortion , cheese eating , wine loving , shower ignoring people !, 
  amazing !, 
  the `` rejection '' of islam ( whatever that means , with your stupidly ignorant outsider view of it ) is n't something pushed by christians ( i 'm an atheist by the way ) . 
  the main `` blows '' on islam in france are due to the very harsh secular values of france . 
  for example , the veil bans in public schools and all , are enforcements of secular laws . 
  catholic institutions and leadership tend to be more open to islam than anything else . 
  at least in their official statements and actions . 
  muslims , by the way , joined the catholics in these anti-gay-marriage protests . 
  sure . 
  most first generation immigrants tend to though . 
  it 's their offspring who do n't know how shitty their ancestors ' lives were in their country who more often tend to not give a shit about how lucky they are . 
  yes . 
  obviously , europe 's geographical position makes it the go-to place for most of the millions of africans and middle easterners who want to try their lives in a free , modern society . 
  similarly , we hardly have any latin americans in europe , except perhaps in spain . 
  if europe did n't accept massive numbers of unqualified immigrants , there would n't be these problems in the first place . 
   the irish are way more inclined to buy a house than rent one like our european counterparts i think most people would like to own a house or apartment , but it 's often very difficult in some countries , or specific regions , where property is extremely expensive compared to the median salaries . 
  how about these big boxes with wings flying 30,000 feet in the air , with hundreds of passengers ? 
  crazy idea , eh ? 
  what ever happened to the development of these mega high speed `` trains '' in airless tubes which hit internet craze and fantasy a few years back ? 
  the idea seemed genius . 
  forgot what it 's called . 
  it 's a shame the us does n't have high speed rails . 
  france boasts a paris to marseilles high speed rail in 3 hours , which is pretty damn fucking fast , thus i 'd always prefer taking the train than hassle with a `` short distance '' plane flight , or day long car ride . 
  the us , with it 's open spaces , could do like china and provide some much faster high speed rails through the mid west . 
  imagine whizzing through the great plains at 500 km/h ( ~ 300 mph ) . 
  ok , then it 's just in copenhagen then ( i just heard it was a scandinavian thing , but only saw it myself in copenhagen and surrounding towns ) .

  definitely a great opportunity for your kids . 
  i have a dual french and american citizenship . 
  i 've never used the us citizenship really ( except for faster lines in the airport if i travel there ) , but i 'm still young and i like to know that i 'd have no barriers if i want to work there . 
  also , if i get into any trouble outside of the eu or the us , i could potentially have two embassies ( or more ... any eu embassy i think ) working to help me out . 
  anyway , to be honest it 's not that hard for educated americans to move to the eu if they have a job opportunity . 
  but it sure makes it easier if they just have eu citizenship . 
  the advantage is they would n't need to find a job prior to coming , or have a visa time restriction and race to find a job willing to pay the extra money in taxes to employ a foreign citizen . 
  so if the money is n't crippling financially for you , and if you 're more or less certain it would work , you should definitely go for it . 
  rofl , what a ludicrous thing to say . 
  i 'm both a french and us citizen myself , and the eu is certainly not `` pretty shitty compared to the usa '' . 
  there are of course some places and domains where the eu maybe is n't as good , but others where the eu does better , and naturally , other domains which are n't comparable in terms of better or worse . 
  it 's a big city . 
  if it were constantly dangerous it would n't be sustainable . 
  it 's still surely the most dangerous of the large cities in france , but that does n't mean that everyone is a victim of crime every day . 
  one can still be considered unlucky if they 're mugged there . 
  i feel they 're people who have strong feelings against israel , and also happen to be the usual suspects in delinquency , like in most western european countries . 
  so i tend to dislike comments claiming they 're just `` opportunists '' . 
  no they 're not . 
  they came to protest for palestine , and they 're also delinquents . 
  to put it in brute words , they 're typical hoodlums , who happen to be of muslim background and thus side with palestine . 
  i 'm however not suggesting that all muslim youths are looters , nor that all protesters for the palestinian cause are looters . 
  just that these guys are n't opportunists who just unassumingly joined the protest without having any prior opinion on the matter . 
  however , they mix things together , and will protest for palestine , and attack the french police as they bunch up everything they hate into one basket . 
  it 's understandable considering many russians are nostalgic of the glory days when their country was a super power alongside the us only . 
  imagine the trauma of the 90s when russia was relegated to irrelevance in a matter of a couple years . 
  for them , they 're just taking back what 's theirs , and regaining their place amongst the world powers , at least politically . 
  economically they still have a road to cross . 
  what 's sad for them however is that they 're mostly just alienating themselves from everyone . 
  russia could become a great relevant power again without having to bully everyone . 
  i feel everyone would love a `` nice '' russia . 
  it seemed relations were going well with europe in the early 2000s , but russia decided to go apeshit for some reason , although getting along could have been mutually beneficial , especially for russia which could have profited from developing to western standards and receiving admiration from ex-soviet states , instead of fear . 
  not only that , it 's the rebel areas of eastern ukraine which should be avoided . 
  this plane 's rout is not at all above those areas . 
  frankly it 's kind of ridiculous that planes are avoiding the entirety of ukrainian airspace . 
  there are no rebels in western ukraine with massive anti-air missiles ... 
  but i understand that airlines will still avoid all of ukraine airspace just to reassure passengers who do n't know the difference . 
  minerals , wealth , influence , power ... 
  it 's more often than not about more than just expanding their territory just for the sake of it . 
  for a second there i thought you were making a joke . 
  i almost missed the vehicle in the background . 
  i 'd add that the countries closer to russia are whaling but are n't doing much either considering they 're entirely dependent on russian gas , unlike the western countries where the dependence is rather small if not practically non-existent . 
  so in the one hand there 's those highly dependent nations who fear sanctions will hit them harder , and then there are the other nations who have little motivation/concern about the situation . 
  so we got two blocks whom for their own reasons ca n't agree to actually sanction russia in any meaningful way . 
  and the only way anyone will want to sanction russia meaningfully is if they 'd agree to all do it together - not just one country ( france for the warships , germany economically ... certainly do n't want to be the only ones hitting hard , especially considering they 're not really affected by the situation ) . 
  so as long as the eu does n't have one unified foreign policy , it will remain a soft power which any strong nation can trample over without suffering the consequences ( unless one nation or a few in the eu decide to take things in their own hands ) , despite the eu technically being the first economic power by far if it were considered one block . 
  so it technically could have some significant leverage . 
  the eu does n't take foreign policy actions . 
  the individual countries inside the eu do ( though they admittedly did not in the case of cyprus ) . 
  germany did n't support the iraq war . 
  with france and russia , it was one of the main countries against it . 
  otherwise , for the rest , i 'm kind of on the fence but to each his own . 
  i 'm not sure you 'll get a response considering i have n't seen many people , if at all , on reddit from those micronations . 
  however , i 've been to andorra back in the day , and i 'm pretty sure they like being a small country . 
  it 's like being an island . 
  they do n't get in trouble because they do n't matter , and they like it that way . 
  also their small size gives them an enviable high quality of life , and they would n't want it any different . 
  they 've always been small , so similarly they do n't feel embarrassed about it , and do n't have fantasies of glory , or power , competition and whatnot , and thus do n't have any feelings of shame either for not being the best . 
  what crimes did germany commit in 2006 ? 
  the films do take place in the us , but all the films are also partly set in sicily . 
  but in this case , in godfather ii , the protagonists go to cuba , and this old dude has heart problems but asks that his doctor be sent to him because the cuban doctor there ca n't speak english . 
  those chicks translating simultaneously . . 
  so weird . 
  it 's like when you accidentally open a youtube video twice , and thus the sound comes out for both videos but they 're slightly out of sink . 
  anyway , it 's quite a shame that a president needs someone to translate english to him . 
  in the godfather 2 a protagonist says `` i ca n't trust ( the opinion of ) a doctor who ca n't speak english '' . 
  soon perhaps , it could be the same for candidates for a top political position . 
  france is n't a small country relative to europe , but i remember after our veto of the iraq war how americans went apeshit , bashing their french cars , pouring french wine in the gutter , and congress renaming `` french fries '' to `` freedom fries '' . 
  the french news reported a lot of that craziness , because we were so fucking baffled by the insanity . 
  it almost became a freak show , like `` tonight on what are those crazy americans doing this time ! '', 
  well in the end of middle school history/geography class , we learn about `` modern history '' , and that 's essentially post-ww2 , or cold war politics . 
  at least that 's how it was some 14 years ago when i finished middle school . 
  surely now history class goes up the the 2000s , especially considering the importance of 9/11 for the current geopolitical situation . 
  in high school history/geography class , we learn about the main world powers ( usa , eu and japan during my time , now surely japan is replaced by china ) . 
  but i do n't feel we have actual political education either . 
  in high school there was an optional class called `` social education '' . 
  i did n't take it , as i took another option ( `` engineering science '' ) . 
  but i do believe that `` social education '' class must surely be about national and international politics . 
  but as i said , it 's not mandatory . 
  however , a class which is very prominent in france 's high school system is philosophy . 
  among the subjects studied ( philosophically ) are some politically related . 
  questions about freedom , the morality of a state or something , secularism . . etc. . 
  having a bumper sticker with your political opinion in france is probably the best way to get your car keyed !, 
   other factors are that there 's quite some voter mobility , especially compared to two party systems like in the us oh yeah , that 's a very good point and you 're surely right about this , as it applies to france too . 
  while there is a strong left or right wing base in france , there is also a very sizable part of the population which fluctuates from one to the other , even from far-left to far-right to take a more extreme example . 
  as for expressing loyalty to one particular leader , that 's actually still very strong in france , since in france we consider our presidents to be kings of sort . 
  however , it 's mostly about the individual person , and not whether he 's left wing or right wing . 
  so people might not want to associate themselves on social media to that one person , because they do n't want to be associated to the person 's party . 
  they like the person as president , not necessarily the party . 
  in france it 's considered somewhat rude to ask someone who he voted for , unless they 're very close . 
  politics , just like religion , are considered to be private matters and there 's thus a taboo of sorts in overtly revealing your opinions or beliefs . 
  this could explain the small number of `` likes '' for politicians on social medias , because that would be displaying to everyone , including to pseudo-friends you 're not very close to , what your political beliefs are . 
  also people are very opinionated , and that could alienate you from others if they do n't like your political beliefs . 
  so people will rather keep it mostly to themselves . 
  otherwise , the average guy in france will know the political leaders of the larger , more relevant , and closer european countries ; the uk and germany mostly , russia of course , but also to a lesser degree italy and spain . 
  an above average politically aware person will know about most european leaders . 
  humanities is great . 
  that 's what i studied at first . 
  but the competition is harsh . 
  go for science class . 
  many fields in humanities and social sciences can be filled by people who actually studied science .

  the current situation is n't easy , but it is way easier than back then . 
  the writers of the declaration did n't have islam in mind , but they had the mighty catholic church and the monarchy in mind , in a country without a unified culture . 
   what kinds of people join these anarchist groups ? 
  in france at least , many of them are actually bored college kids , usually studying social science . 
  the rest are fringe elements and half homeless . 
   i have a feeling these punks would be the first ones to run away if there was any sign of real trouble i would n't be so sure about that . 
  it 's true for some of them , but many loves to fight , literally , with the far-right and riot police . 
  those who are messing up in calais or around international meetings are violent people . 
  those who wrote * nik la france * ( ie : `` fuk the france '' ) are probably not the british ones though . 
  the * declaration of the rights of man and of the citizen * , which protects the first generation of human rights and is still in the french constitution , was written in 1789 during much more troubled times than today . 
  you ca n't hijack a plane without being in it . 
   ca n't they just offer benefits to citizens ? 
  you ca n't discriminate between eu citizens like that . 
  that 's currently a subject of conflict between the uk and the rest of the eu , and an argument for the brexit . 
  they are not colonialists at all nor responsible for israel 's policy . 
  they are civilians and not even israelis !, 
  they are victims of antisemitism justified by hate and stupidity , not by the `` official recognition of terrorists '' such as the olp , which was n't even considered as terrorist by many european countries and is now officially recognized by the un . 
  but the jews in france are n't the people being blamed for `` defending themselves '' in the gaza strip or jerusalem by any sensible person in the west . 
  the onus is n't only on `` palestinians who bomb people '' . 
   for ** no reason other ** than they 've been programmed to think that way . 
  or may be for the same reason that people in the west now view the european colonial past as a disgrace . 
  the theory linking political institutions and the choice of the longbow presented by this article is very interesting . 
  but there are many flaws . 
   \u03c9f = unstable , \u03c9e = stable t t f f attacks if p / ( 1 -- p ) < we/wf ; e attacks if p / ( 1 -- p )  we/wf the writer 's inner economist trying to establish mathematical laws about * arms-decision * , * attack-decision * and political stability was nonsense . 
  you ca n't use mathematical parameters like that to determine who is more likely to win a battle , take the decision to attack or use a specific weapon . 
  this is especially nonsensical as we are talking about the 13th and 14th century , war and events . 
  how are you going to measure the impact of irational feelings like fear , the quality of a leader , his sense of battle , the weight of traditions , the loyalty , or mysticism as involved with joan of arc 's epops ? 
  also , the writer uses extensively the number of soldiers involved in each battle . 
  but there is an enormous bias , considering that a soldier , especially at this time , was n't equivalent to another soldier at all . 
  in 1346 , for example , at the battle of crecy , the english army was small , but made mainly of high quality semi-professional soldiers . 
  this army was rich because the war was n't too long for them ; they came to loot and destroy as much villages as possible , because the strategy was aimed at proving that the french king was weak . 
  the french king , who was a bad leader by the way , had a bigger army . 
  but his army was exhausted financially . 
  the knights wanted to fight accordingly to the courtesy rules : you do n't kill another knight , you take him as prisoner to randsom him , which is a great way to get rich . 
  they were n't also keen to follow orders , and rushed toward the opposing lines to get hostages , messing up with their own infantry lines . 
  even the article 's introductory battle , `` the battle of halidon hill '' , is supposed to display the `` potency of the longbow '' . 
  one could also say that this battle just displayed the potency of any kind of ranged weapon when you are entranched in a defensive position on a hilltop , against an enemy climbing to reach you ... 
  haha [ thanks !, 
  there are n't as much vegetarians in france , and schools do n't accomodate them , but the way the cultural problem is solved is by proposing a pork dish and a fish dish . 
  such a solution seems fair and simple , as is yours . 
  but nowadays , you have the far right whining about the fact that we accomodate dishes for some religion , and also some muslims whining about the fact that their dishes have touched a pork dish , and therefore became impure . 
  stubbornness is bound to grow , whatever the fair solution you might find . 
  the argument is that some jobs can be created if the minimum wage is lower . 
  they do n't currently exist , like dog walker , or someone filling up the tank of your car at the gas station like in the past or in some other countries currently , because people are not ready to pay someone 8 $ per hour to do so . 
  if the minimum wage for refugees was like 4 $ per hour in germany , a job like dog walker or gas station attendant could become a thing . 
  if the refugees are working in such a low wage job , they would be actively , albeit modestly , participating in the economy as a whole , increasing the size of the german economy . 
  also , let 's say that they earn 500 $ a month like this . 
  thus , the state only has to give them 200 $ to help them meet the cost of living , instead of having to give them 700 $ , which means that they 'll rely less on government assistance . 
  as they would become actors in the german economy and in the german society , they wo n't resent germany . 
  the downside would be the induced social dumping for german unqualified workers and for the rest of europe 's workers , which german employers would probably like , as most economic liberals ( newspapers as * the economist * , the imf ... ) . 
  the question of the minimum wage is always a tradeoff . 
  considering that germany is facing almost full employment and a huge export surplus , i think that higher german wages would be better for everyone in europe , which is the contrary to the imf 's recommendation . 
  stop speaking german . 
  also , improve the weather and the landscape . 
  a ban on foreign religious funding , including mormons ' funding , is unlikely to find many peaople willing to defend the salt lake city 's church accross europe . 
  if you reduces the minimum wage for some people , it will make the situation of the other people with the same qualifications as them but with a higher minimum wage worse , outside of a bloated market , because they 'll risk unemployment . 
  many jobs without qualification do n't have a significant marginal product of labor , but are needed and are filled no matter how high the minimum wage is ( to some extent of course ) . 
  therefore , the people filling those jobs are being paid more than what they would be worth in a system without the minimum wage . 
  currently , for example , a woman is being employed at the german minimum wage as a german cleaning lady in a bank . 
  she does n't have any specific qualification . 
  she is n't making any amount of money for the company , but someone like her is needed , because the bank has to be clean . 
  let 's say that you reduces the minimum wage for the refugees in an attempt to match the new `` optimal minimum wage '' . 
  the german cleaning lady will just be replaced by a cheaper refugee cleaning lady . 
  you did n't created a job for this newly employed refugee , you just gave him a job that already existed , for a cheaper cost . 
  are n't your two points contradictory ? 
  in france , almost every satyre is allowed ( outside of calls to violence or hate , or insults against a private person , but it 's not really satyre per se ) including any satyre about religion ; but the theme of the holocaust is a minefield . 
  a racist or too sexist satyre is also not allowed ( but satyre about racism is allowed and common ) . 
  for example , our minister of justice , who is a black woman called christiane taubira , was mocked as `` having the banana '' ( which is an expression for `` smiling '' , albeit here used to make the link between her and an ape ) by a far right wing newspaper called * minute * . 
  the newspaper was condemned for this . 
  such a text as the one written by bajto about our national anthem would have not been seen as problematic at all . 
  an asylum seeker is in a very strange and annoying spot where he ca n't do anything albeit waiting : he ca n't act as if he 's going to stay ( study , work ) but he has to stay idle during the proceeding . 
  if the judicial or administrative process is too long , he has to stay in this temporary spot which is annoying for him and for the country where he 's staying , as the asylum seeker is just a burden at this moment . 
  the claim , if successful , will force the german administration to give a quick answer . 
  also , the 6th article of the european convention for human rights requires cases to be heard within a `` reasonable time '' , because of the importance of administering justice without delays which might jeopardise justice 's effectiveness and credibility . 
  this principle is being enforced more and more among european countries . 
  ( i ca n't speak for the specific german law . ), 
  some of them are not qualified and educated , but i was n't talking about them . 
  i was talking about the qualified and educated one , who needs to be acclimated . 
  for example , a foreign doctor in the uk needs to get accustomed to the way the nhs works , what are the law surrounding a british certificate etc. . . 
  refusing to make up proceedings to use the skills of those people is annoying for us ( because most european countries are lacking doctors ) and painful for them , as it was for the russian doctors or architects who ended up as taxi driver or garbage men in the west . 
   its not european medical orders dislike competition , its that nobody will want to get treated by anyone who looks even slightly non native because of this . 
  public safety concerns are the public argument to restrain such recognition , and they are legitimate . 
  but it 's also a fact that medical orders , as any professional order , usually dislike competition . 
  the less people are admitted , the better the situation is for those who are already in . 
  that 's also why many european countries are lacking doctors . 
  for example , it 's extremely difficult for a german or french doctor to be allowed to work in canada , whereas he is as qualified , educated and skilled than canadian doctors . 
  what i said is only relevant about the people who had those high qualifications in syria , it 's not relevant for the majority of them who do n't have significant qualifications . 
  about the roadmap , it depends on the country and the type of field and job . 
  for example in france , a syrian doctor can have his qualifications recognized after some proceedings , and it 's not unusual to ask them to work as medical interns for a few years before becoming a `` real '' doctor . 
  ( you ca n't work as an asylum seeker though ) . 
  on the other hand , it is impossible for a qualified nurse coming from outside of the eu ( and a few countries like andorra and switzerland ) to have such recognition . 
  the main problem of qualified and educated migrants from syria , as it was for former soviet countries , is less about their qualities than about the recognition of their qualities . 
  for example , if syrian doctors are not well trained enough , this can be easily solved by admitting them as medical interns during a few years . 
  but it requires political will , and european medical orders dislike such competition . 
  the same thing can be said for architects , engineers etc. . . 
  the arrival of large numbers of migrants coming from the south in poland is unlikely , schengen or not . 
  the greek debt is n't in drachma , but in euros . 
  if they go back to the drachma and devaluate , the country wo n't be able to pay its debt either , because the debt will grow proportionally to the devaluation . 
  economically , france is very close to the uk , the main difference being that the pound is strong currently and unemployment is higher in france . 
  if the uk is rated aaa , it 's logical that france 's rating remains only slightly lower .

i do n't know what i like more , that a good part of europe loves pure fan-service shows , or that in the middle there 's the swiss with the toilet seat salesman . 
  aah , i had forgotten the american threats . 
  you lot are a lot like russia in that respect . 
  you do n't intimidate me , pig . 
  edit : i understand that the insults is not good for clear discussion , and i will refrain in the future , but seeing as he 's started with the veiled threats , i can confidently say there 's no discussion to be had . 
  ( still , i 'm sorry for everyone else ), 
  someone here and on other subs said that trump and his kind would make france `` great again '' . 
  i already think with all it 's problems , has it 's greatness , but that 's beside the point . 
  the most objectionable part is that the `` greatness '' they 're talking about is a military obsessed , anti-intellectual , fanatically religious and brutal state , the opposite of what france stands for , which shows me that they never understood what made france a good country . 
  if they want to destroy the republic , than they 'll have to do it over my dead body . 
  i ca n't say about the whole country , but should i talk about my area ? 
  i can categorize thoughts into a before and after brexit . 
  before : a lot of people were dissatisfied with how it handled the immigration crisis and austerity and were overall negative . 
  after : there 's been a political break between the far right and the rest . 
  the far right now want to leave the eu , if not it 's active destruction , while some of the moderates have now grouped around the eu in support . 
  so the overall impression is either extremely negative or very positive , at least for a loud minority . 
  if they could n't nail sarkozy for his blatant corruption , i do n't know how they 'll get hollande . 
  it 's just a petty political ploy . 
  i 'm with ypallage . 
  in addition she would have to get a majority and get past the first turn . 
  if she gets elected , i 'll be more worried about my france 's people in general than her . 
  seeing what trump 's said about us , i am always astounded by how numerous his defenders are on this subreddit . 
  relations are a two way street . 
  there 's movements to exit the eu from the above countries , such as from the fn in france . 
  that 's a good point . 
  i do n't understand france , germany or italy wanting to leave the eu because they are for all intents and purposes the heart of the eu . 
  it 's like washington dc trying to secede from the us . 
  yet , it happens . 
  it already was a sovereign nation , but you fascists would cry about that all the way to a damned dictatorship , would n't you ? 
  there 's a segment of italy which also wants to leave the eu , and i would prefer if that did n't happen . 
  it 's simple enough . 
  i really , really hope that italy does n't leave . 
  it should have more prominence in the eu now to get their policies passed and we need to unite , now more than ever . 
  so elect the fascists or doom france ? 
  that 's a false choice and i sure as hell am not sacrificing liberty for a false sense of freedom . 
  i like it as it is , warts and all . 
  i am certainly not interested , in what the far right has defined as `` great '' . 
  no more environmental measures , massive deregulation and privatization , contempt for human rights , breakdown of international co-operation , far less stability in the long run . 
  there 's a world beyond stupid college level pc culture . 
  i regret having visited those subs . 
  the only thing that makes me laugh is that the le pen subreddit is mainly housed by americans . 
  i 'll copy the others here and say , well said . 
  `` the false notion that democracy means that ` my ignorance is just as good as your knowledge . 
  ' '' this is always worth keeping in mind . 
  that ; s always a good quote i found in these situations . 
  they have the platform , they are free to speak , but if we are not allowed to criticize them , we are not in a democracy . 
  then tell me what they are . 
  i find they differ between different fn supporters . 
  it 's certainly finding fertile soil in the current mood . 
  oh , sorry about that . 
  i thought you were supporting her ( which i realize is n't a cause for hostility either ) . 
  le pen was the headwind that 's for sure , but the anglo-sphere is hopefully different than the political climate in france . 
  we 're not in a post-scarcity market place however , which is why france 's slow economy is hurting a lot of the lower classes . 
  if le pen is to be stopped , an idea that the political elite have n't abandoned the average french resident must be heard . 
  i refuse to let le pen win , i am not voting for her . 
  i am not willing to sacrifice the republic for this . 
  with the politicians that have been popping up lately , i think i prefer having dull bureaucrats . 
  i did n't specify europe , and it suggested that i try tokyo or seoul . 
  what ? 
  then i got munich , which is closer . 
  no , that 's tyranny of the majority . 
  democracy also understands that some issues are up to different types of votes . 
  a complex issue in a in black and white referendum is not a healthy discusison . 
  it 's their mandate phrased in making the market more competitive . 
  they outright said they were going to lower taxes on the mandate and repealing regulations ( page 19 ) . 
  of course my comments are complaining about it . 
  does n't mean that the jab about the eu getting sovereignty from the uk is n't a satirical jab . 
  besides your entire history is short questions to annoy or insult those against the brexit . 
  why should i have any good faith in you ? 
  well , it 's the tories . 
  you pretty much just need to frequent this sub for the news . 
  they 're are n't making their plans a secret . 
  that being said , i 'll find the info : https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/manifesto2015/conservativemanifesto2015.pdf in my experience , i can link the guardian and the independent , but it might be better to get the proof from the party itself . 
  https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/may/10/conservatives-to-push-forward-on-manifesto-and-scrap-human-rights-act i 'll like to point out , that the comment i made about that was partly as a joke , and as a counter to those in thread who was saying that the uk was getting back their sovereignty from the eu . 
  sort of a way to turn that saying around . 
  i mean , i even said afterwards , `` seriously speaking now '' . 
  now the tories are in control of the house with no meaningful opposition and they promise to shred worker 's rights , lower corporate taxes and repeal regulations to keep the uk attractive to companies . 
  i have to laugh , because the amount of self righteous stupidity here in shooting yourself in the foot would make me cry . 
  hint : murdoch was for the brexit because he could n't control the eu as well as a single nation . 
  happy republic day to the turkish !, 
  no disagreeing that open communication are important , although my point was that repressive governments will try to cut down freedom of information , and you yourself have said that violence is the answer against that repression . 
  you 've made a logical leap , that freedom of information will automatically guarantee peace , and that 's hardly peaceful . 
  unless you want a constant cycle of repression and violence or a state of anarchy , a government that enshrines the important of free flow of information is paramount . 
  no , but it does mean a breakdown of international relations , thus against your point that relations will never degrade . 
  as for their reasons for voting brexit , one of the main threads on the brexit here is that they wanted less immigrants with the brexit voters supporting that . 
  if their anger is because of inequality , they 've channeled take into hate and xenophobia , if recent news is to be believed . 
  edit : i am for free societies , but i know that populist revolts such as the brexit are not going to lead more equality or justice . 
  already to remain competitive , they will reduce corporate taxes and other such measures will not only hurt their hated immigrants , but the poorest englishman as well . 
  congratulations , in the name of the problems of capitalism , the voters have made it worse . 
  in the event that there 's a coup d\u2019\u00e9tat of the whole eu , it is much less likely to be successful than a localized coup d'\u00e9tat in a single nation . 
  not to mention that 's the eu 's existence will make it less likely that a free society will not fall to a single nation 's military or radicals . 
  how are national borders `` filters '' what would that mean ? 
  addendum : personal awareness is not a proof , i remember the democratizing effects in many eastern european nations and the iberian peninsula . 
  your view that they would automatically democratize takes a dangerous view of history that progress is guaranteed , instead of hard fought . 
  russia is an example of a nation that did not enjoy this democratization and instead turned to a oligarchy . 
  your last claim is not true . 
  i think one of the best and worst features of the eu is that they have helped made europe stable and politically free , which many people are now taking for granted . 
  it 's not an institution apart from itself but a collaboration of various nations , take it down and what will you replace it with ? 
  because if you claim that without it there will be the same level of co-operation , that would be a lie . 
  good thing for foreign investors , not necessarily those who have their savings in pounds .

  absolutely , simply unacceptable . 
   want to cut down 40 % of the cost of diagnostic tests . 
  reality does n't work that way . 
  you ca n't decide to abolish 40 % of medical treatment and hope it just work somehow while it 's already nearly not working . 
  what if we cutted 40 % of the creditors ' decision makers ' personnal income for a change ? 
  pegida are led by [ litteral outright nazis ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jan/21/pegida-leader-styled-adolf-hitler-lutz-bachmann-german-islamist-terrorists-facebook ) . 
  of course they do n't like journalists . 
   and this means lower pricing . 
  ahhh i see where that 's going . 
  lower pricing which is then used as an excuse to hypocritically lower wages , which is highly illegal if you are an employee under contract in france . 
  so uber used illegally the contractor statut ( something they got nailed upon repeatedly ) to just make do without the whole working laws and fucked over their de facto employees more than usual . 
   it 's a new business model but good old capitalism . 
  well it looks more like they found a loophole to try and maximize their profits at the expense of their drivers . 
  i 'd * almost * side with them and suggest forcing uber 's hand to give them a rise ( which looking at uber 's record profits they can in fact afford ) if they were n't so annoying on the highway haha, 
  so , what are they asking for specifically ? 
  what are their demands ? 
   new gov is trying to break constitutional tribunal . 
  that 's certainly something worrying, 
  we 're not `` importating '' , they 're coming in any way . 
  so we can either : 1 \u00b0 ) try to control the flow , separate the trouble makers and kick them out , turn back a % age of them , teach the rest our laws , enforce them and force integration one way or another ( you shall be assimilated ! ), 
  2 \u00b0 ) having the same flow coming in illegally regardless , kill large amount of people at our border and see them coming in either way , and have no control over it . 
  see also the mexicans that cross the death valley ( which really deserves it 's name ) on foot with nothing , despite military patrols and crazy locals shooting at them . 
   who actually need to be taught to not rape women ? 
  there are the same kind of `` reminder '' courses for the policemen and army , so it 's not just immigrants . 
  but obviously people see what they want too . 
  it 's `` merely '' a crash course on 20 years of education most locals got as a kid but like to forget about . 
  edit : altho to list some current sticky problematic points : - identifying problem maker groups , better tracking of individuals ( fingerprinting and immigrant id papers for anything important , those being associated to your fp , is part of the solution ) - refusing and enforcing controls against benefits shopping . 
  ffs countries like poland and austria , france or belgium are extremely respectable places to live in , sorry . 
  if you do n't like the food we might try finding better food but no you are n't getting a ticket to germany . 
  and if you do try to get benefits in germany anyway you get found out when showing your id or trying to get a new one for assistance , because your fp are already registered and matched ) - finding new ways to promote ( or , in some case , force ) integrations in the new culture . 
  - we might have to speed up deportations of purely economic migrants , trouble makers - better enforcing the law among problem groups and areas , and finding out ways to deal betters with problem neighborhoods ( we 're looking for solutions ) - finding solutions for our population aging / lack of replacement problem ( ongoing ) - finding reasonable/appliable ways to reduce the flow at our border , without causing a massacre - finding more cash to entice turkey towards more cooperation - better information of pre migrants , that no in europe you wo n't get a free car and free 200m \u00b2 house and free domestics to serve you . 
  that 's lies invented by people smugglers . 
  do n't sell your house and car because you 're going to get disappointed when you only get an hotel room and a hundred euros for food and heating in europe ( which does n't get you far here ) . 
  it 's definitely a social issue we will have to address sooner rather than later . 
  it likely involves : - more tax on specific groups and individual and rich corporations - more than anything , crack down on evasion and actually start to collect tax on the largely evading big corporate system . 
  most of the money is in big corporate pockets , and they all fraud ( `` evade '' ) all the taxes . 
  if we ca n't enforce our own tax code , we are screwed . 
  - in the most abusive oligarchic cases , seizing all the billions on swiss accounts and redistributating one way or another ( e.g : in state budgets ) might be needed too . 
  wayy too much money is staying out of the general population 's economy . 
  if they ca n't play ball by paying their taxes or employees a fair wage , we will have to redistribute all that dormant money or all the money that only circulate from one billionaire to another . 
  well such programs can not hurt imho . 
  excellent call for all the countries involved . 
  now to make it mandatory for any migrants or risky group ... ( it also allow the gov a vantage point to keep an eye out for potential problem makers . ), 
   cameron will get a few breadcrumbs from the eu i 'm assuming he will get more than breadcrumbs . 
  based on his recent letter , i would n't be surprized if he actually gets half his demands . 
  but that also mean he wo n't get the other half and that both sides will need to compromise . 
  and i do n't know if that 's enough . 
  it 's almost as if they learned letting their boss fix any wage ( or lack of thereof ) they want unilaterraly without any stopblock and having no legal minimum wage thanks to the glorious free market was a bad thing . 
  i guess they learned from last time : this time they are blocking highways in paris and not calais , that should make the uk and drivers happier haha ... 
   like some professors said , it should be seen as purely humanitarian not as a solution to get working people so we can assume that all of them will just drain resources . 
  true , but putting to work ( with incentives , carrot & stick : / ) as much of them as possible to fill in the crack of the european economy ( jobs nobody want currently ) would help lessen the less controled parts of the crisis currently . 
  it 's not a solution ( part of the problem lay in syria/libya ) , but it 's a stop gap we should n't ignore . 
   will also fun to see if merkel has to eat her words at some point when she said that `` germany will never close it 's borders '' if you really want to gloat and be smug , technically she already did : x, 
  well it was admittedly in turkish space for 17 seconds from most commonly aknowledged sources . 
  the questions ** whether that justified a shoot down ** ( i suspect no , since the russian plane was already out or leaving by then i believe ? 
  ) , whether it the plane entered by accident and whether the pilot heard the turkish radio coms or not ( and why ? 
  accident ? 
  radio on the wrong freqs ? ), 
  still do stand . 
  and it 's also highly possible the black box was damaged by the destruction of the plane . 
  stop saying `` us of europe '' , it 's like saying `` the confederacy of america '' t _ that makes me cringe , sorry usa . 
  it 's either the european union , or europe , or europa ( like in http://www.europa.eu ) . 
   let 's talk about social benefits , to be on the dole for example ... 
  if there was an european common pool for social benefits , where it would n't matter in which eu country you live we will need to finish rebuilding eastern europe and make their country more attractive in order to level income and lifestyle costs to do that . 
  and keeping the largescale crackdown on corruption working to ensure corrupt state officials do n't steal all the eu welfare in eastern europe either ( because a lot of corrupt romanian or hungarian officials would love nothing more than direct access to eu bank accounts ) . 
  but i would support it once that much is done . 
  but it 'll take at least 15/20 more year . 
  ca n't be done right now . 
   here lies the issue , would people be willing to lose their own nationality in order to be european only ?!, 
  no issue  a nice eu id card/passeport would totally fit the bill . 
  altho i 'm pretty sure the uk would refuse it for their part and asks for either an opt out or leave it . 
   this is normally a criticism between northern vs. southern countries , `` i 'm dutch and i work hard !, 
  those greeks do n't want to work , i do n't want to pay for them to be lying on the beach ! '' . 
  those people will always find `` foreigners not in my social group '' to blame regardless of the reality . 
  even if it 's a neighbor next door . 
  even if they knew on an intellectual basis that greeeks work 60h/week for 600 $ , they 'd find a way to blame the greeks or italians or spaniards or `` dem isis muslims browns '' or `` the lazy anarchist youth that could just get a job '' for their dutch wage `` only '' the double . 
  it also mean we well need to cut down on the `` let 's blame that group '' attitude that the media love to relay . 
  no all social issues are n't caused by dem muslims taking-your-jerbs . 
  it 's also because your boss ( who actually has all the money in the corporation ) do n't want to pay you more because he would rather offer himself yet another tv set or car . 
   the question should be , `` looking 200 years from now , what do we really want for ourselves and for the future ? '' . 
  exactly . 
   would europe as a whole be better of as a single country , aka federation ? 
  at my own level , i definitely think so, 
   ukraine has enough currency reserves to pay it back , but refuses for obvious reasons ( occupation of crimea by russia and their support for separatists in donbas ) . 
  yes and no . 
  the writing is on the wall that they 'll soon bankrupt or will have to suspend something major like healthcare or retirement which is n't possible . 
  better cut some slack before they hit the wall and end up like greece . 
  so they take a page from russia in the 90 and do a partial default ( like russia did ) to restart on a healthier economic basis . 
  why did the default happen on russia ? 
  ironically , it 's not really russophobia , but also an investor trust thing : that way they can pretend something along the lines of `` we defaulted on russia because we are at war with them . 
  we are n't at war on other investors so we wo n't default like that on them so you can trust us '' . 
  clever . 
  after `` boire ou conduire il faut choisir '' ( drink or drive , pick one ) we should put the same type of ad in france haha, 
  there is that issue where the increase of immigration could in the end bring more people than we can socially handle . 
  you ca n't decide to ignore any social problem and not do anything about anything because there 's a remote chance some guy might become corrupt then might escape fraud inquiries . 
  they 're in libya . 
  and lots of refugees fled daesh controled areas in syria . 
   it is amazing how often you hear let 's send them back and you end up in a plane that is not allowed to land and/or in the end flies home with all the `` unwanted '' . 
  1 \u00b0 ) we have agreements with a lot of countries to ensure that does n't happen 2 \u00b0 ) for those that send us people without reasons and refuse taking them back ; we can always suspend all their visa and refuse any and every single one of them . 
   even germans before the war tried to deport thousands jewish germans over the border to poland , oh come on .

   corroborating accounts from volunteers , medics , refugees and other officials reveal that sexual abuse is common within the large camp at dunkirk and that children and women are forced to have sex by traffickers in return for blankets or food or the offer of passage to the uk . 
  will the lock get you to uk ? 
  this is n't friggin people barging in other people 's houses . 
   i 'm sure actual police knows about it more than me . 
  yes . 
   i do n't see how that relates to my comment . 
  you obviously do n't understand how complicated law enforcement is when the victims do not want to cooperate with the authorities . 
  i took the time to remind that indeed it is very difficult . 
  http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-37622796 really man ? 
  http://projects.aljazeera.com/2015/08/sex-trafficking-in-romania/index.html?utm_content=nobylines  according to the u.s. state department 's 2014 `` trafficking in persons '' report , one-third of romania 's trafficking victims are underage girls . 
  but thanks for the advice . 
  will keep in mind , 
  ireland would veto any such procedure ( and it would be a fair thing , they did n't sign up for this ) . 
  any eu army would actually have to be a european project separate from the eu . 
  you can not have armies act on the same procedures as the eu ( unanimity for agreements etc. ), 
   try to solve how do you solve something you do n't know exists ? 
  say a rape happens but the victim does not come forward . 
  how do you know a rape happened then ? 
  how do you know who 's the victim ? 
  and how can you determine the perp ? 
   well if someone writes an article about the issue well there are articles about many issues . 
  about all types of abuses , about all type of sex rings ... and the sex rings and trafficking still happens all across europe . 
  until one of these women decides to go to the police , nothing will happen . 
  and they wo n't because those demanding sex are telling them they 'll get them to uk or other benefits . 
   what 's the point of police that works only when no one commits a crime ? 
  if nobody calls the police , they ca n't do anything . 
  unless in your country you have a magical police that is able to tell when crime happens without being informed . 
   does anyone actually report these crimes to the police ? 
  well does anyone do that ? 
   the authorities have an obligation to investigate and take appropriate action . 
  i 'll give you a hint : nobody tells the police jack shit . 
  are the 14 yo romanian gypsy brides calling the cops often ? 
  how about all those romanian prostitution rings ? 
  do the hookers call the cops when they have problems ? 
  because they 're not doing it in france . 
  we do n't do sensible comments on / r/europe ( i too am guilty of that ) . 
  it 's a rantfest . 
  no we 're not . 
  the eu was not meant to be a military based organisation . 
  that 's why you have countries that are either neutral ( ireland ) or independent ( sweden ) in the eu . 
  eu wo n't go military any time soon . 
  and the european army wo n't go nuclear any time soon after that . 
  the vast vast vast amount of political talk on / r/europe is very low quality . 
  low quality and superficial analysis . 
  a ton of bias . 
  either way , the parlament will be ump so any other president besides fillon wo n't be able to do basically anything . 
  macron has no party , fn wo n't win . 
  ps might miiiight have a chance of a good score . 
  so i should call the doctor if in 4 hours my hard on does not subside ? 
  same goes for this post saying the usmc used the ss as official insignia . 
  so crimea 's part of russia according to google ? 
   , is there anyone here that has actually cancelled or decided not to visit paris/brussels/berlin , or anywhere in europe because of terrorist threats ? 
  we were down [ 750m euros ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/paris-isis-tourism-attacks-impact-money-lost-aftermath-a7205121.html ) in august last year , wrt to the previous year . 
  so yeah . 
  yeah but it 's no fun visiting a country in lockdown after an attack . 
  60 % of french are paid between minimum wage and minimum wage + 300 euros . 
  what 's your point ? 
  you do n't understand . 
  / u/carnagh is most likely the ilk that thinks people like climate scientists are actually political pawns, 
  le pen 's at 40 % . 
  another 5 years and . 
  another 5 and she 'll hit 50 % . 
  tick tock . 
  that or the euro dies . 
  there are n't 10000 possibilities . 
  france already proposed common euro debt . 
  who has the money . 
  in majority germany . 
  some parts france etc. 
  nowadays france and germany are making money off of greece . 
  it should go without saying , should n't it ? 
  that 's fiscal convergence and that 's what you need to do when you have one currency . 
   one currency one common fiscal policy . 
  i doubt netherlands or belgium are doing that well . 
  finland also is in dire need of help . 
  there 's not a ton to explain . 
  remove the defense budget from the 3 % deficit criteria . 
  i do n't want our national security to be in danger because omg 3 %, 
  austerity is related to the southern countries . 
  europe is not just france ... or so i was told . 
  oh you mean who 'll finance the defense budget being removed from maastricht criteria ? 
  well uhm ... if they need an excel licence fine , i can provide one ... it 's not for an institution but it 'll do in a pinch . 
  did that clear everything up ? 
   but i 'm not willing to kill it because of them , knowing the alternatives . 
  the alternatives are a period of cool down and new projects in a few decades . 
  i prefer that to a europe that just doesnt go anywhere because nobody wants to compromise ... which is where we are . 
  i do n't want france to become the next italy . 
  how to finance a new asylum treaty ? 
  if they need pens and paper i can donate some . 
   16 billion is peanuts hahahaha ... hahahaha ... hahahahaha . 
  oh and the trade balance was -20 billion in 2015 . 
  that 's about 150 % what uk paid to the eu budget . 
   so having some countries where there is a trade deficit is beneficial . 
  for germany , maybe it can afford . 
  for france ... nope . 
  this trade agreement is dead in the water . 
  i 'll get muh popcorn when it voting will happen , 
  10 new airbuses ? 
  that sure will fix our trade deficit of the order of 16 billion we have with vietnam http://ec.europa.eu/trade/policy/countries-and-regions/countries/vietnam/, 
  this is a bit outdated .

do n't worry , you still have the better wurst . 
  because no one is willing to pay the $ $ $ , while as you stated , they do n't make people feel safer . 
  either that or wait for some greek national to come here with a better answer than every single one you 'll find here . 
  i was not down to mcdonald 's level , that shit is disgusting , if that can reassure you . 
  in picardie they seem to make a few efforts at least , but i think it 's to avoid a public outrage here . 
  i 'm not sure it 's that common for people to make fries at home , especially since it 's the most avalaible side dish in restaurants and food chains . 
  also , pommes de terres saut\u00e9es of course . 
  life 's gon na be happy on the most sterile environments known to humanity . 
  do you pay for fuel ? 
  there 's a shit-ton of people fleeing away from paris , but there 's a shit-ton more moving to it . 
  housing in paris costs around 50 % more than the rest of france , while for the rest it 's around 3-10 % more expensive ( excepts alcohol which is basically the same price ) . 
  * parisian accent : people who pretend to have a culture * not parisian accent : people who do n't pretend to have a culture, 
  of mice and men takes a whole new meaning to me . 
  i had a hard time finding the answer , they hid it in small letters at the bottom of their offer . 
  bottom of page 3 of the [ pdf ] ( https://mobile.free.fr/docs/tarifs.pdf ) . 
  basically , they ask `` reasonable use of their services '' . 
  they consider that an usage is abusive when your international consumption/presence on the international is way over the national ( french ) consumption/presence over a period of ** 4 months ** , or prolonged sim inactivity . 
  in these cases , free mobile reserves the right to make you pay communications at the current rate ( available [ here ] ( http://mobile.international.free.fr/?pays=allemagne ) . 
  sadly , i 've just noticed that ** you need to justify a frequent and signicative presence in france ** to apply to the offer . 
  i think with free you get for 20 $ / month : unlimited call/sms/mms +5 go data in whole europe/ca/us / aus ( 100 go of data in france ) . 
  i do n't know how easy/hard it is to subscribe from abroad though . 
  might be an italian banking crisis . 
  why would people care about that thing ? 
  live , yes , but on quite low standards . 
  however , you have to take into account that , according to the french constitution , every citizen has the right to get a work , and has the duty to work . 
  basically , this means that you have to be unable to work to live on state 's welfare . 
  not really ( on my own view , i ca n't answer for other people ) , since i hardly have an opinion about the people of a country . 
  there can be tendencies from the culture , which can either be on the plus or minus side of an opinion , but culture will be culture and people will be people . 
  it 's just not possible to generalize an opinion about people . 
  if you ask me , i dislike huge parts of american culture , but this has nothing to do with d. trump . 
  that 's it , children 's right first . 
  it 's more of a psychological research that takes 20 + years than of an ideological fight . 
  alsace and moselle were n't french when churches were separated from the state . 
  this basically means that these poor guys have religion courses at school ( they can have a derogation under parent 's demand ) , but also that these fuckers have two more public holiday . 
  nobles no longer have privileges since 1789 , and aristocracy is no longer recognized by france since 1870 . 
  obviously , there still are descendants from said nobles [ that lived through ] ( http://imgur.com/a/btnkt ) the reign of terror in 1789-1794 . 
  some of these nobles got to keep their heritage through generations , whether it 's castles or culture ( i.e. 
  some families may have kept contact with other famillies ) . 
  there are a few pathologic cases who acts as royalist like [ henry de lesquen ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/henry_de_lesquen ) , but these guys are considered as jokes by the rest of french society . 
  castles are extremely expensive to maintain , so most of them are either falling apart , used for tourism ( bed and breakfast or publicly funded for most special ones ) , or have been bought by some random rich guy . 
  in the [ hercynian forest ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hercynian_forest ) , you can find bisons , elks , aurochs , wolves , bears , hyenas , leopards , lynxes and much more . 
  i 'm incredibly sad to say that it was 2000 years ago , and that the only remnant of the hercynian forest is the [ bia\u0142owie\u017ca forest ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bia%c5%82owie%c5%bca_forest ) in poland/belarus . 
  there are some bisons ( reintroduced ) , wild horses , bears , etc. 
  most informations of the hercynian forest are recollected from pline the elder and julius caesar . 
  in france that would be sncf or total , for people with a bachelor at least . 
  excellent working conditions , nice bonuses ( who said free train ? 
  ) , and guaranteed stability . 
  m\u00e6rsk in denmark i think too . 
  mostly '' * wtf are they trying to accomplish ? * '' . 
  especially since no one seems to be able to find some relevant illegal thing ( atm ) . 
  survival i guess ? 
  maybe killing time in the meanwhile . 
  to be honest , i find this poll quite representative of what the conversations have been on the sub for the past few months . 
  compared to france as a whole , only fillon and le pen have been extremely underrepresented on / r/france . 
  i ca n't remember of more than 4 or 5 posts defending fillon 's positions . 
  there were a lot more for le pen , although even when in minority her supporters know how to be quite vocal . 
  obviously an online community is bullshit compared to the scale of a national election . 
  more like [ this ] ( http://www.strawpoll.me/12475452/r ) ( / r/france poll ) : m\u00e9lenchon 33 % , macron 24 % , hamon 14 % , le pen 5 % , undecided 6 % , abstention + blank 10 % , rest < 2 % each ( including fillon ) conservative liberals ( lr ) and nationalists fn are severly under represented on / r/france compared to france overall . 
  i 've discovered this sub quite recently . 
  to be honest , i know almost nothing from eastern europe , and one of the main reason i 'd like to stay a little longer is to learn more about its countries ( and because there 's a civil war on / r/france right now , this sub feels like a haven of peace in comparison ), 
  yup , we definitively disagree on the matter . 
  there 's a ton of implications for both models and we can hardly measure or predict their respective impacts on the larger scale though . 
  sadly , you are right . 
  we have a huge lobby , fnsea ( national federation of agricultural holder 's union ) which has been pushing agriculture towards more and more industrialized farms . 
  no tax harmonization . 
  and cap . 
  not really , and i doubt we 'll get any tangible policy for the next 5 years . 
  not really , though we might encounter sceptics from time to time on the internet . 
  mostly hard liberals who are sceptics by ideology because they abhor government 's impositions . 
  we 're deeply fucked and we 'd better act fast to define a strong energy policy shift and develop resilience plans ( mostly for water , agriculture and climate refugees ) . 
  i consume as less as i can . 
  i 'm about to get employed for the first time since i 've just finished my studies , and i will need a car on a day to day basis which is enough to piss me off quite a bit . 
  currently , entertainment mostly comes from outdoor activities with little to no car involved , and internet things . 
  ooohh the same story happened to a friend ( without the hedge of roses ) . 
  he wore a 5 centimeters scar on the face for quite a few months after that . 
  not really , market is already filled by kronenbourg , heineken , and leffe on the higher end . 
  i had to check online for [ full statistics ] ( https://fr.statista.com/statistiques/509431/habitudes-restauration-midi-francais/ ) concerning workers . 
  35 % bring their own food , 25 % go buy a sandwich outside of work , 20 % work canteen , 15 % eat at home , 4 % in a restaurant , and i would n't like to be among the last 1 % . 
  though , it 's mostly employees of large firms ( 50 + ) who have an access to work canteens . 
  mostly out of public debate , apart from a few interviews with [ matthieu ricard ] ( https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/matthieu_ricard ) here and there . 
  the topic is slowly but surely gaining ground though . 
  because there is a stupid amount of unnecessary math in any project that involves the imperial system . 
  also , us seem quite alone along with a few countries in using the imperial system . 
  illegal , i guess . 
  basically , hadopi law , voted in 2009 , has set a frame for graduated responses to copyright enfringements when downloading . 
  however , this law had barely any impact on illegal downloads , despite its high cost (  10m $ ) : * only torrents are monitored . 
  as you might have guessed , most people transfered to streaming and direct downloads . 
  some learnt to use vpns . 
  * legal offer is still pathetic , which make illegal downloads are more convenient in most cases ( i.e. 
  without considering the cost ) . 
  * only a few copyrighted contents are monitored by hadopi , so that 's about blockbusters and major albums releases . 
  * in case of enfringement , graduated response consists in one warning email , followed by one warning registered letter , and then law pursuits . 
  in the 2009 -  2015 period , 7.5 millions warning emails were sent , 622000 letters , 1000 files forwaded to the public prosecutor 's office , 39 went to court . 
  i do n't know how many were condemned . 
  fun fact is , you 're fully responsible if your neighbour pirated your wifi to download musics . 
  also , most people do n't care about internet piracy ; some care about not receiving letter in their own house though . 
  of course , you still exist , though i must admit that i live 1000 kilometers away , and that i know very little about you catalans . 
  someday i 'll pay a visit to you guys ... 
  i think i 'm doomed for writing this . 
  [ * camembert normand * ] ( http://www.normandie-actu.fr/files/2016/03/camembert-commons-wikimedia.jpg ) is the way to repentance .

actually yeah , the catholics would say that orthodox are misguided , and same for the others all around ... nowadays they tend to focus on what they have in common but in the end there are disagreements ... 
  well paul said that , so the catholic church says it 's so . 
  you ca n't just decide unilaterally about these kinds of things if it 's not backed up by scriptures . . 
  do n't you worry , we got it . 
  * has taught me, 
  [ o macron !, 
  her father was quite close to a nazi , and he founded the party . 
  people rightly assume that most of the members who were there in the first place are racists/anti-semites and such , though obviously its electoral base has greatly expanded during the last years . 
  this , and a permanent blockade against her in the media , where she is totally isolated , especially by the left . 
  france has a semi-presidential system . 
  the president shares his powers with the government , which is led by the prime minister , who is chosen from the majority party in the parliament . 
  the prime minister nominates the government members , but the president may veto them i think . 
  laws and bills are either issued by the government or the parliament , but given that the government gets to dictate the * ordre du jour * ( the day 's agenda for debates and such ) , they have arguably the upper hand on a daily basis . 
  to this you have to add the fact that due to a reform in the 2000 's the legislative elections now closely follow the presidential elections ; due to the dynamics the president usually have a majority/a government from the same side , which makes governing easier . 
  the president may dissolve the assembl\u00e9e nationale if he wishes so , and call for new elections . 
  the assembl\u00e9e may push a motion of censorship if they succeed in getting it voted in , in which case the government ( i.e. 
  the prime minister and the ministers whom he has nominated ) has to resign , and the president may or may not accept the resignation . 
  this is * not * an impeachment ; the president 's role has been specifically designed so that he ca n't be reached . 
  very unlikely . 
  on their right macron is more popular . 
  on their left m\u00e9lenchon is more charismatic and appreciated . 
  the only thing they 've left is their core voters ... all three of them . 
  so here we are with the main contenders . 
  the primaries are mostly over , the only serious doubt is whether fran\u00e7ois bayrou , a centrist who got 9.5 % at the last presidential election , will be a candidate . 
  otherwise , from ( political ) left to right : m\u00e9lenchon , hamon , macron , fillon , le pen will be the names we 'll hear in the next few weeks . 
  anything goes from there , as this is one of the most uncertain ( and exciting ! ), 
  elections we 've ever had . 
  lol dude , if you wan na include fluent people it 's more like 8-10 %, 
  they 're not serious , but burgundy is indeed the name of the color . 
  it 's way too soon to say . 
  however as a frenchman : this info came from the `` canard '' , which is well known for its vast network of informants , from which it grows its best scoops , so the info is at the same time legit and serious ... 
  not saying that nor the contrary ; but this proves that the political system is n't as locked by a few powerful figures as we used to think . 
  sorry i do n't know much about jojo save for the memes and polnareff : /, 
  and you ca n't listen to michel polnareff either for the same reason ? 
  oh , sure , but even in this case we have fillon , le pen , hamon ( ? ), 
  macron for the debates when we could have had sarkozy , hollande , le pen just a year ago . 
  i think we 're doing quite well . 
  the media has been rooting for him , honestly i do n't know . 
  i think that if hamon gets the nomination macron will be in a very comfortable spot in the middle , where he could get 2nd turn against fillon . 
  it 's excellent news : we are having a very open election this year , with unexpected candidates despite what it looked like initially . 
  let 's be honest , the situations in which fukushima happened would never happened in france . 
  to me it is actually justified to promote nuclear energy here when in japan it 's much more complicated to defend . 
  i see where you 're coming for , but a le pen victory would n't be an absolute surprise , not anymore . 
  there would be trouble but it would n't come from nowhere . 
  to me fillon 's rise is a much bigger upset . 
  she 's been ahead in the polls for years , so not exactly an underdog ... 
  just have a look at this : https://sondages2017.files.wordpress.com/2016/06/graphique-sondages-primaire-2016-lr.png?w=700 in april 2015 sarkozy was at 70 % , jupp\u00e9 20 % , fillon was n't there . 
  in may 2016 the matchup was definitely jupp\u00e9-sarkozy , both of whom were close to 35 % . 
  fillon was at 18 % . 
  in the end fillon crushed them both after making an impression during the primaries ' debates and got 44 % , nearly 20 % more than jupp\u00e9 . 
  after the first upset of fillon beating jupp\u00e9 / sarkozy on the right , it looks like another underdog will represent the parti socialiste for the next election ... 
  full results : beno\u00eet hamon 35,8 % manuel valls 31,3 % arnaud montebourg 17,8 % vincent peillon 6,77 % fran\u00e7ois de rugy 3,77 % sylvia pinel 2 % jean-luc benhamias 1 %, 
  the constitutional treaty ... 
  well that 's a shit map . 
  i 'm living in the area that 's supposedly the worse in france for rape and i can tell you that there 's nothing there . 
  the r\u00e9gion centre is too uninteresting for rapes to happen en masse that 's for sure we got sick castles tho, 
  because news in english will mostly be from the uk , which means that they 'll be focused on the uk . 
  oh , sure , i mean i was just speaking about fillon personally . 
  and that 's pure speculation from my side . 
  i do agree that we have to get out of this dead-end with russia , considering that eu and us interests regarding her are quite different . 
  we have more to gain with a healthy russia than the us do . 
  too bad that it 's not headed this way tho, 
  you 're welcome !, 
  you 're being unfair . 
  imagine a great power , broken in a few months , then occupied , partitioned , led by a once legend ( p\u00e9tain ) now reduced to a puppet in the hands of the nazis . 
  add to that the fact that a part of the population collaborated with the occupying forces in a genocide . 
  the spiritual and moral situation of france at the liberation was just terrible . 
  it was necessary for de gaulle to embellish the truth rather than to insist on the darker sides . 
  when a war comes to an end you call for people to come together , you do n't try to bring them apart no more . 
  just look after any election , here it was the same , but way worse . . 
  russia is seen in a more positive light among french catholics because they tend to be more conservative , the same way fillon is . 
  no gay marriage , no gender thingie , emphasis on traditional values , etc. 
  it does n't matter that russians are n't very religious as long as putin is seen abroad as a friend of conservative values and a support of the russian orthodox church . 
  french politics have always been more positive regarding our relations we russia than , say , the u.s. or australia ( and i think it 's healthy ) . 
  he 's not exactly pro-russia but not a rabid russophobe , that 's for sure . 
  he 's pushing for more cooperation on international subjects and i think he 's personally more favorable to russia due to the fact that he 's religious . 
  she has a good 70 % chance to reach 2nd turn ( the remaining 30 % would be the left uniting behind emmanuel macron , who is surprisingly high in the polls these days , in which case she 'd be 3rd behind fillon/macron ) . 
  from there , she has to win the 2nd turn . 
  here her chances are much slimmer , around 15 % ? 
  i think ? 
  there would have to be some major scandal around her opponent ( something akin to the servers thing in the u.s. for example ) for her to pull an upset . 
  as of right now , the answer is `` very unlikely '' . 
  she could get good results at the legislatives though , but that will depend on the ability of the front national to organize itself for a major election that does n't imply only one candidate . 
  why do n't you call the belgians or the luxembourgish arrogant then ? 
  how is it `` arrogant '' to ask for the parliament to work in strasbourg ? 
  i feel like your stereotypes are at play there . 
  you would n't call the germans defending german interests arrogant . 
  [ this is kinda supposed to be my job , so i hope i did okay ] ( https://imgur.com/a/attoe ), 
  his wife speaks slovenian at least . 
  maybe italian as well , who knows ? 
  what 's the movie ? 
  excellent news . 
  that 's not making it an issue , there is nothing contentious with saying that . . 
  he did n't make it an issue , his opponents did . 
  that 's just not true . 
  stop hating on him just because he 's not an atheist . . 
  most : remarkable history and culture , and still a very active cultural and scientific scene nowadays . 
  great achievements brought and being brought to the world by french citizens . 
  founder of the eu and unarguably its most important member alongside germany . 
  least : a general tendency to self-deprecation / very high pessimism that is now deeply ingrained in french culture .

  that 'd be their second referendum if they really want it . 
  and if he gets re elected they 'd still have somebody with a brain , that somewhat care about his country more than his own petty political seat ( he proved that when he vouched for remain , then resigned ) and not even corrupt for once . 
  i usually disagree with him about a lot of things , but those are 3 important qualities to look for in a pm imho . 
  otherwise i expect a lot are going to vote for corbyn . 
  just gon na have to watch out to prevent all that fraud against him that 'll inevitably crop up . 
  that you for your highlights , good points, 
   i doubt ireland could afford the subsidy that the uk currently provides no , but the eu can make up the difference . 
  we 're currently subsidizing the entire uk , not just ireland . 
  we can probably manage to funnel ireland an extra b or two from the funds that ( in that brexit no eea scenario ) once went to the uk . 
  now of course if the uk take an eea approach and keep borders , movement & goods & cash flow open at current levels ( basically a near eu member ) ; the point is moot since they 'd keep the subsidies and ireland is likely to stay in the uk ( and the money to take an eu  uk  n ireland road ) . 
  ( scotland is the main candidate for independance in case of brexit . 
  it seems n i will try to stay in case of brexit but eea ), 
   it 's unlikely that fucking up northern ireland is their main goal it 's not their main goal . 
  i would suspect they ( neocons ) just do n't know anymore how to act apart building another guantanamo and tossing their opponents in it & stamping out everything by force as of late . 
  they spent half their late life disconnected from the average citizen . 
  that do n't do wonder to social skills or understanding such problematics . 
  i think he played on that because the uk where reported multiple time for their brutality in the way they treated ira prisonners, 
  thing is , if the uk brexit , northern ireland will be quite better off reunified . 
  basically , after decades of blood in the streets , there was a bit of a peace process where the ira ( the irish resistance ) defacto agreed to lay down their arms and go back civilian in exchange for minority rights and other concessions . 
  of course now the morrons the torries want to replace cameron ( gove , possibly may ) are thinking of cracking down again on the island ... ( 'cause obviously they have nothing better to do than toss gasoline on the smoldering embers of past wars to start their new carreer , right ? 
   prisoner releases should be halted while punishment beatings go on . 
  so he sponsors torture on top of the rest of his bs ? 
  that 's probably why he wants out of the european court of human rights too . 
  and after johnson this is the next guy that fancies himself pm ? 
   you need to change your ca n't to did n't need to . 
  it 'd be like saying `` it 's not i ca n't stop smoking , i do n't need to '', 
  meh , that one looks like only 1cm high :d let 's compare it to real us food like the [ burger lasagna ] ( https://tailgaterivals.com/wp-content/uploads/epic-meal-time-hamburger-lasagna.0.jpg ), 
  til you can get diabete or cholesterol merely from a picture, 
   are you crazy !, 
  what else should we put on our pizzas ? 
  [ burgers ? 
  ] ( http://www.pizzadelivery.org/portals/0/contentimages/bacon-cheese-pizza-burger.jpg ) or maybe [ hot dogs ? 
  ] ( https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2015/06/image_163/lead_960.jpg?1434038339 ), 
  your stance on immigration seem pretty reasonable to me . 
  it 's not impossible that norway might get a few concessions to contrast the situation with the brexit , tbh . 
  that seem a very probable and realistic scenario ; +1, 
   ca n't happen . 
  wo n't happen . 
  the wto is n't going to give a fuck that we 're breaking eu laws . 
  life is going to keep being just as full of disappointment for the brexiters as past brexit theories :-)  ireland is n't in schengen ireland is in the eu and defacto basically in shegen , despite having never ratified the paperwork . 
   the eu has no power over irelands visa policy . 
  i suggest you document yourself in a hurry :-)  scotland will never join the eu if visas are required to visit england . 
  oh no if you close the border we will ask the same , different thing   they 'd almost certainly get a schengen opt out too . 
  the optouts is a neocon/torry-con only obsession nowadays ... 
  they 're the only europarty that ca n't talk/think about anything else  i do n't think you realise how often eu laws are ignored . 
  in fact , your country ( france ) is one of the biggest offenders of ignoring eu law . 
  lol like about what ? 
   germany also has more infringements than us . . about what ? 
   we 're the most compliant major economy . 
  while talking about closing borders illegally and violating every single last trade treaty ever ? 
  haha . 
  is cocaine still such a rampant problem in the office ? 
   we will ignore eu law if we need to , and nothing will happen . 
  ohhhh is that hsbc ? 
  i think we 're going to re open that folder written `` fiscal advantage if they move in paris '' . 
   not even counting that we 'd stop buying pounds once again and the value would lose once again another 20 to 30 % the day you start ignoring eu treaties . 
  we 're not going to fund billions to the country that loudly claim they 're going to fuck us over and that `` you ca n't do anything '' are n't we ? 
   1 ) do n't invoke article 50  2 ) ignore eu law and start negotiating trade deals with other countries . 
   3 ) ignore any rulings against us . 
  that 's how you get a 15-20 % punishment tariff applied immediatly on any transaction between the eu and uk  the eu ca n't legally impose tariffs worse than the wto ones the wto personnal has been known to be quite imaginative on their rulings when they want to be dicks  so if we 're getting them anyway there 's really no harm in acting hostile to the eu . 
  they ca n't punish us worse . 
  grab the popcorn boys . 
  in that case i 'd sense the eea agreement with double extra `` fuck you '' fees . 
  oh you do n't want the eea either ? 
  damn , you do n't like freedom of movement ? 
  i hope you like the idea of having to fill visas to go to ireland or scotland . 
  well it 'll be just like at home with the other corrupt bloodsuckers :d, 
  i 'm desperately trying to follow your image of juncker palpatine , without much succes . 
  this is the most unlikely thing ever . 
  while he might try shooting lightning from his hands , if there is a wannabe crazy dictator , i do n't think it 's him . 
   of course both sides are trying to maximize their benefit . 
  if by that you mean the conservative are forced to stop lying to everyone constantly on everything while plundering the country , then yes at least a lot of people will benefit from it . 
   oh i know , but the irony of the leave campaign using eu privacy legislation would be too gloriously silly . 
  haha . 
  is it valid tho in that case ? 
  i mean , the privacy law in question was intended for private personnal stuff , and not big public political campaigning . 
  i 'm not sure i have a perfect answer , admittedly ; it 's falling within the ethics domain and debatable, 
   most of the things you 've mentioned ca n't be redirected easily because of how they are defined by appropriations laws and the institutional intransigence of the u.s. government . 
  ( the f-35 is a debacle but its impossible at this point to kill the program because it has so much momentum . ), 
  and what happen when the entire spending budget is like that ? 
   both sides are financed by the same corporate donors and face similar pressures . 
  i do n't disagree , but the republicans have been pretty vocal about cutting foodstamps , forcing people throught weekly drug testing for getting welfare , going as far as disabling their credit card on the atm `` to prevent them from spending it all on booze and drugs '' ( thereby making the welfare unusuable ) ; offering giant tax breaks and corporate subsidies to the richest ... http://www.ibtimes.com/paul-ryan-gop-eye-23b-food-stamp-cuts-2017-budget-2369301 http://www.ncsl.org/research/human-services/drug-testing-and-public-assistance.aspx http://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/nation-world/national/economy/article24784612.html http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/gop-passes-massive-tax-break-millionaires-billionaires if as a politician you cut food money to 40 millions people , pass in a 7 work day week ( wisconsin anyone ? 
  ) , disable some people 's bank accounts `` because it 's going to be used on booze '' but you give an additionnal $ 10 ' 000 ' 000 ' 000 in tax breaks to your billionaires friends and $ 50 ' 000 ' 000 ' 000 in appropriation spending to your other billionaire friends , i will see you as a crooked thief . 
  and that 's how i see quite a number of gop heavy weights . 
   nah , did n't happen in the 2000s and it wo n't happen now . 
  the party and country have changed a lot in the last 10 years and there are serious blocks to prevent that from happening . 
  i 'm not too worried . 
  i do n't trust them , and i do n't think i ever will . 
  and i think the people in the 2000 's that made up half of bush cabinet 's were outright criminals with a colossal amount of blood on their hands in afghanistan , iraq , and they planed iran too . 
  i was happy to see them leave out power , but now it 's obvious they 're trying to get back in for more easy money . 
   what trump can do as potus is very limited . 
  yes and no . 
  because the senate is a supply side establishment rubberstamping tool right now , if they get both the house and the president and/or justice in their pocket ( scotus ? 
  ) , the republican party will pretty much have unchecked , unlimited political power over the usa with very few capable of telling them `` no '' if they decide to abolish welfare , healthcare or food stamps overnight and just give it all as corporate welfare to trump industries ( or say , their corrupt friends building the f35 who likely grossly overbilled a lot of things multiple times , with sometime a price as much as x30 ; remember the 20 million euro km of road concrete material in eastern europe ? 
  it 's the same ) in a new `` supply side friendly '' budget this time ( because , quite frankly the f35 is the goddam symbol of their corrupt process running the things and that mainly serves to mislead a lot of money while underdelivering way too late ) . 
   tax reform is the biggest thing that people are expecting . 
  there are serious problems with our tax code there is a problem , agreed . 
   and the republicans are the only party with enough institutional investment to fix the system . 
  but , the republicans are also financed by people like the koch and walton brothers or donald trump , who also happen to do n't like paying taxes at all.so i 'm pretty warry of their planed changes somehow . 
  because , this is the true face of a full republican ( conservative ) party dominated america .

  i 'm more inclined to think they 'll put much more migrants on their boats so that eu troops * wo n't * shoot . 
  i do n't think smugglers would want to lose both their ships and their future clients, 
  in order for a true union to be created , you need one identity . 
  people should start feeling more european , rather than french , spanish , british , italian , etc. 
  the only way i know to achieve that is an eu wide education reform , implementing things like `` european history '' but of course this would be met with a lot of nationalist backclash . 
  countries do n't want to lose sovereignty . 
  thanks , had never heard of this . 
  what happened in 2001 ? 
  really good point, 
  no , they 're like the gendarmes in france . 
  they are a branch of the army . 
  did n't know putin had links to minas morgul, 
  the french way . 
  nee - j - air . 
  j must be pronounced without the d sound , only the \u0416 sound . 
  greece gets constantinople back . 
  no polan ? 
  meanwhile france is happy with 0.3 %, 
  i do n't know what to say . 
  hello airstrip one . 
  it 's not a new symbol . 
  it 's the ribbon of st george . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ribbon_of_saint_george it 's been used several times before to celebrate victory day . 
  but it 's true that op 's gif might not be from this year . 
  they say that this country is 100m \u00b2 . 
  the m-95 degman croatian battle tank has a length of 10,1 and a width of 3,6 m. 
  that 's some ~ 36m \u00b2 of surface area this roughly means that you could theoretically occupy a third of the kingdom with a single tank . 
  yeah , and three flavours of them . 
  on one side you have the legitimists , they fight for the claim of [ louis alphonse de bourbon ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/louis_alphonse,_duke_of_anjou ) , descendant of louis xiv , the sun-king . 
  his kingname would be louis xx . 
  then , you have the orleanists , saying that [ henri d'orl\u00e9ans ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/henri_d%27orl%c3%a9ans,_count_of_paris ) is the rightful one . 
  he 's a descendant of louis-philippe ( ruled from 1830-1848 ) , the king during the restauration of the monarchy after the 1789 revolution . 
  he 'd be named henri vii if he somehow gained the throne . 
  finally , you have of course the house of bonaparte . 
  right now , the direct heir to napoleon i is [ jean-christophe bonaparte ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jean-christophe,_prince_napol%c3%a9on ), 
  that was very informative , thank you for your great comment !, 
  or [ this eerie picture ] ( http://rarehistoricalphotos.com/george-lincoln-rockwell-members-american-nazi-party-attend-nation-islam-summit-1962-hear-malcom-x-speak/ ) of george rockwell , head of the american nazi party during the ** 1960 's ** during a nation of islam summit . 
   from its inception the anp ( american nazi party ) had referred to african americans as `` niggers '' and had affirmed the premise that they were mentally inferior to whites , but rockwell became enchanted with the idea of a coalition ; nazis and black muslims could be allies , since they both sought the same goal -- separation of the races . 
  * sigh *, 
  well , [ these lovely guys ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/13th_waffen_mountain_division_of_the_ss_handschar_%281st_croatian%29 ) were muslims . 
  everyone finds a way , i guess, 
  and they left ceau\u0219escu . 
  they could have taken him back too, 
  best of luck to you !, 
  i think limiting it to it 's role as a com tower is silly . 
  it was the most visited monument in the world as of 2012 , also has a restaurant . 
  when you think `` paris skyline '' , it 's hard not to picture the eiffel tower . 
  what would you define it as ? 
  i think you should rather post it on r/duolingo . 
  i 'm learning german too , it 's neat . 
  it 's actually the same size as the shard in london . 
  so i guess the author did n't count it as a skyscraper . 
  and [ pizza hut ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgm14d1jhu ), 
  many right-wing conservative candidates it seems . 
  i know the country is a catholic stronghold , but were most candidates similar in the past ? 
  55 % is overwhelming ? 
  there 's still room for debate , the snp gaining almost every single scotish seat shows that too . 
  the brexit referendum is now assured . 
  i ca n't help but think the next few years are going to be `` interesting '' . 
  scotland will not like this . 
  today i learned the existence of the `` monster raving loony party '' . 
  3000 ~ voters . 
  [ nevers ] ( http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/nevers ) is the capital of the ni\u00e8vre department , but there 's not a lot to say about it and the wiki page reflects that . 
  ( still unsure why they chose a picture ** from ** one of our few monuments , instead of a picture of it ) the city is rumoured to have been founded by julius caesar during his gaul conquests , starting out as a fort defending this part of the loire river . 
  a few centuries later , they started building a romanesque church , but they took so long that new styles appeared like the famous gothic style ( like notre dame of paris ) . 
  thus we have a cathedral with two naves ( one romanesque , one gothic ) and no fa\u00e7ade , you enter through a tiny door on the side . 
  most of the roof and windows were destroyed during ww2 by english bombers that tried to destroy the loire bridge and failed . 
  this might shock you , but they finished the job last month or so . 
  the tower is finally like it was decades ago to pursue the religious cultural stuff , nevers is also the resting place of bernadette soubirous . 
  a 19th century nun that claimed to have seen the virgin at lourdes , in southern france . 
  the body of bernadette is actually in a glass coffin , and her skin had been coated with wax right after her death at age 30 or something . 
  thus , she has not decomposed . 
  to change topic , if anyone is familiar with f1 racing , you might have heard of magny-cours , well it 's a neighbouring village . 
  and the famous racetrack is right next to it . 
  we also have a `` world famous university '' called isat , it 's for automobile engineers . 
  apparently every young indian student has heard of it . 
  what the hell , preachers ( whatever their religion might be ) encouraging people to disobay the law because they should follow the laws of whatever god they worship should be arrested and stripped of their right to preach . 
  this is nonsense . 
  edit : could someone explain to me the meaning of the texts behind the man at 15:30 ? 
  red text reads `` should we invade persia or rome or both '' i think . 
  this almost looks like a scene out of four lions !, 
  indeed , or at least those involved should be closely monitored . 
  i did upload the files to wikimedia , but what now ? 
  is there anything i should do ? 
  i 'm new to using this particular website . 
  eh , to be fair , it could describe someone that does not believe that the etna is awakened . 
  fixed indeed , thanks !, 
  they look brand new , where can i get my own tank for only 99.99 ? 
  `` please ignore what is happening on the mexican border '', 
  your link does not work sadly ... ^ the ^ government ^ got ^ them, 
  alright , i 'll try , good idea . 
  not really , it says `` ginta str\u0103in\u0103 '' , meaning `` foreign people/nation '' . 
  i 'm sure someone with more romanian experience could translate it better than i did , but i can assure you you that this article does not mention gypsies, 
  except for , you know , the monarchy part . 
  and he 's already out of the hospital . 
  i 'm pro-eu , however even though we have the parliament of strasbourg , this does not change the fact that i feel disconnected from the political process of the eu . 
  - it 's institutions are unclear ( the council of europe = / = european council = / = council of the european union ; for exemple . 
  three different entities with such similar names . 
  it 's a mess ) - european voters only vote for the european parliament , instead of having a say in who leads the eu . 
  i believe that this indirect democracy system can have some impact on voter turnout .

  of course . 
  she 's good at french then , 
   not wanting greece to be overwhelmed by refugees is hardly a `` messiah complex '' . 
  charter planes , trains and boats . 
  what 's so impossible . 
  there 's a direct route on the danube route . 
   closing the borders is a short-sighted solution as it does not help the whole of europe . 
  what if we sponge the greek debt  instead of france and germany turning a profit over it ? 
  * cough * * cough *, 
  he 's better that the parisian mayor is in english . 
  neah it 's good . 
  he 's actually good at it , just stuttering at times but i think that 's to be expected . 
  way better than the parisian mayor in english . 
  http://en.rfi.fr/france/20140322-paris-mayoral-hopeful-makes-election-appeal-foreign-residents that being said , she 's good in spanish . 
  i wo n't be happy unless the germans make a satire special about us . 
  only you guys get to be mocked at . 
   if these `` migrants '' keep coming to eu in the millions , it has nothing to do with refugees since france is very little affected by this problem . 
  why do people impose their ideologies on these issues . 
  https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/monde_anglo-saxon french ca n't help it . 
  maybe our meat would be poisonous to them . 
  mutual asymmetric warfare or something like that . 
   and a million years a go a t-rex would eat us actually it is believed that a human could out run a trex . 
  also many believe that humans did n't live in the same time period as the t rex , who also lived in namerica 60 million years ago . 
  and the balkans and ee was under water at that time . 
  sorry , i mean continental europe . 
  anglo-saxon countries are weird like that . 
   no way in hell i was taking out more loans . 
  well that 's the thing in france . 
  if you do n't get your scholarship ( in science ) no way you 'll get the phd . 
  it 's good in the sense you have to be taken care of . 
  it 's bad because if you do n't get any , you 're told to move on . 
  either way : hey you got way much more nice things to visit and see in france than in uk :p what year are you in ? 
   by the way i was in academia once , it 's shit everywhere , like / u/adalhaidis said , no need to add more shit on top it . 
  they did it once , but i think they got away with it all right, 
  i do n't speak german :(, 
   in the sciences and in engineering , phd students get a ( small but sufficient ) salary from the university is n't that a must in every ( continental european ) country ? 
  in france you have to get the same conditions . 
   since they cost the university more money than the phd students , there are much fewer positions . 
  same here . 
  but i guess it 's normal . 
  fewer phds than masters available , too . 
  it 's a pyramid . 
  show me the french . 
  now !, 
   that they run a public station also prevents them antagonizing the government 1941 ( or 1871 ) low_discrepancy : you sure believe that , huh ? 
   and serbia can be like switzerland . 
  well both countries think they 're superior to their neighbours . 
  so you 're not too far ,

  italy is probably one of the only countries i could live in without missing france too much .

  he divided the country that caused the sunni to rally around isis . 
  isis being created heavily from former ba'ath party members because they had no saying in the new state . 
  i do agree that the us left way too early . 
  but that was a promise by obama . 
  it was his desire . 
   landslide in the mountains ? 
  they look pretty rocky . 
  you talked to people you did n't personally know ? 
  is that really finnish ? 
  that does not confirm my stereotypes . 
  rt.com that only cites twitter comments . 
  we can not do any better in terms of journalism effort . 
  ( maybe also including a link to an the onion article ) let 's wait a bit . 
  crazy dude with electronic bracelet did n't open for the police checking on him . 
  i 've always had the impression that the european societies were being led through an arena by the nose ... and that impression turned out to be right . 
  was n't that the rhetoric for all the revolutions in the arab spring . 
  europeans badly and poorly managed it . 
   that also drives the large migrat streams from states like afghanistan or iraq - people do n't just flee the war in these states but they do n't perceive a chance that this eternal infighting would ever cease . 
  well the non-intervention in syria is causing that feeling of a war that never ends . 
  for 4 years we did n't have a problem . 
  then it exploded . 
  too much is too much . 
  they can just resort to cdds , which they massively are doing atm . 
  you still have a trial period where you can fire at will . 
  what would a protracted civil war like in syria with govt forces killing lybian civilians look like ? 
  thanks . 
   why do n't you give few more billions $ to turkey when you 're at that we will , because we need to solve the syrian problem . 
  thanks us . 
  sure is swell having the us actions supply us with a steady stream of refugees . 
   you wants to exchange dependance on america for `` stronger connections '' with russia and china china and russia want our well being just as much and just as little as the us . 
  they are all looking for their interests . 
  if you think any of them has europe 's interests in higher esteem you are severely mistaken, 
  true . 
  but that dude makes it like france is in full impire mode . 
   if you ( or anyone ) uses nuclear weapons , the world could end in a matter of hours that 's why they were made for . 
   is that really the only option you 'd like to have ? 
  you would n't want to be able to conventionally defend yourself ? 
  that 's what the us provides to europe . 
  why do n't you try to invade china or russia . 
  tell me how it goes , okay ? 
   imagine if the french response to the rwandan genocide was to threaten to nuke rwanda . 
  what a joke you would be ; it is not our job to police the world .

  but that will come one day . 
  people criticize europe , but its the greatest union of countries ever made by humans . 
  exactly . 
  we in europe may not share the same cultures or languages but we share the same values . 
  we must stand strong together if we want to compete with other great powers . 
  however , i think it will take time . 
  it xas shown today with the reactions to us attack in syria . 
  france made a statement about it , as uk and germany . 
  we should have only one statement coming from eu , as we should be under one flag in the security council of un . 
  how can we have credibilty as an union when everyone act alone ? 
  but one step at a time , it warms my heart when i see what we europeans lol made with eu in 50 years only . 
  i never said that french did not have a history with europe . 
  i said that its a fact that france have now more ties with africa than some eastern european countries . 
  i do agree that france was always involved in europe , from the 5th century to now . 
  i know the history of my country , history is my main hobby . 
  i just speak about present , that for the average french it is easier to relate to africa than to eastern european countries ( which is shown today by the fran\u00e7afrique relationship ) . 
  i am pro-eu , i just tried to identify why france is not ( we voted no in 2005 , and the anti-eu opinion is strong , as shown in this current elections ) . 
  the special relationship we have with africa is difficult to explain to someone from estonia . 
  it 's called fran\u00e7afrique , google it , you will find stuff about it . 
  and believe me , i lived in estonia , i was schooled at tut , and i can assure you that someone from west africa could be closer to me ( `` culturally speaking '' ) than an estonian . 
  this is not a criticism , i love estonia , i just pick an exemple coming from my own experience . 
  we have no past with lybia . 
  i do agree that people from northern france could feel culturally close to belgium or netherlands . 
  what i say is that france shared more with west africa or north africa during its history than with romania or poland . 
  i spoked about ties and not about `` things in common '' . 
  france is still culturally and economically linked with west and north africa more than with romania , latvia or poland . 
  there is 17 034 frenchman in ivory coast . 
  430 in latvia . 
  never heard about [ fran\u00e7afrique ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fran%c3%a7afrique ) ? 
  in the way that yeah firstly we speak the same language , which is already fucking important . 
  west african culture was influenced by us as much as they influenced us . 
  we share values with eu too i agree , but for a french , algeria or tunisia will be closer to him than estonia . 
  i did not say that it was an obstacle to eu , but it might be a thing to take in account . 
  i am definitely pro-eu , what i was just trying to say is that i think it 's hard for the average french to feel european . 
  i agree with you that europe is the only way to maintain peace between each of its members and to compete with other great powers ( usa , russia , china ), 
  germany weights in the eu because its big and they are really into it . 
  we are big too , but there is n't the same enthusiasm and investment from our politicians into it . 
  germany also have a strong leader . 
  studies conducted in germany in 1938 probably . 
  spot on !, 
  but i have friends from mali or ivory coast and algeria and i can tell you i feel closer to them than to someone from sweden or danemark . 
  that might be specific to france though , due to colonization . 
  well , for exemple , we french have much more ties with african countries like ivory coast or tunisia than with danemark or hungary . 
  that 's where the problem lies . 
  i think people dont care about eu also because of that . 
  estonia or latvia means nothing for a french . 
  most will not even know where it 's located . 
  how do you want then a working eu ? 
  yeah , but us it 's expected, 
  thanks for the link , very interesting !, 
  while it 's a funny symbol , we do n't have much problem with symbols from monarchy in france . 
  the elys\u00e9e itself was owned by the king back in the days . 
  and that would never happen in reverse . 
  imagine us with a motto in english !, 
  english envy us so much, 
  seems to fit well for the english . 
  let 's give them those , it will help them save money, 
  they ca n't bear to be behind us . 
  i thought they got used to it ... 
  i think this a thing in big languages . 
  it 's the same in france or russia too . 
  poor english abilities , strong internet presence, 
  that was a bad joke about his flair . 
  aryan expert here, 
  who give a fuck about trump there ? 
  netherland is triggered, 
  are n't you french if you father is ? 
  or you did not ask for citizenship ? 
  they talked about immigration and russia yesterday, 
  we are with you netherland !, 
  we should burn them, 
  it has absolutely everything to do with it . 
  muslim faith should not have a foot in europe . 
  it will always be constantinople in our hearts . 
  we should kick them out of europe for good . 
  constantinople belongs to christianity . 
  it 's just classic far left rethoric . 
  israel always there to play the victim, 
  seems to be a nice place !, 
  do n't say that where i live . 
  he studied here in grenoble , and he is basically god there, 
  a freshman or a frenchman ? 
  or a freshman frenchman ? 
  because he is daltonian , not blind , and he can read comments, 
  honestly you are the troll there, 
  yeah , i mean , if they want to list all our defeats , they could as well write all our success, 
  this is definitely the correct version . 
  woah i did not know that there was so many people in lithuania !, 
  thanks god !, 
  we ca n't have a backward country like this in europe . 
  your country is just irrelevant to europe, 
  yes , what i mean is that you will not find gouda on the cheese plate after the meal, 
  i was kind of joking . 
  i did not know that holland was renow for its cheese , because in france gouda is pretty much only eaten in hamburgers , sandwichs or the like . 
  its kind of considered tasteless . 
  but i forget we ( italians too ) live in our own food world , and mostly used to stronger taste . 
  gouda is not cheese, 
  since forever, 
  10 % is fucking huge in the budget of a country . 
  we already seen how it worked out .

  you would have to get a working visa i think so you can earn some money while here . 
  i am not sure what it would require though . 
  i can try and look it up for you if you want . 
  haha one of my friend suckerpunched a parking meter . 
  he broke his wrist and spent weeks in a cast . 
  looks like the parking meter won . 
  it 's so weird how drunk people start fighting inanimate objects for some reason . 
  i would so use sandstorm in my political meetings . 
  it 's the same song , no ? 
  [ lema\u00eetre by closer ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5z8onummou ) is the song macron uses in his meetings . 
  le pen 's voters applauded trump 's election . 
  the people who mocked the us were not the same who vote for le pen . 
  as to the reasons to vote for her : * she is the most credible anti-eu candidate . 
  asselineau is more hardline on eu ( he said he would not even do a referendum and literally has `` the frexit candidate '' written on his posters ) but he is a clown who will never get past 1 % . 
  so if you are disappointed with the eu and want to leave then you have the choice between le pen and le pen . 
  * if you want a tough on crime politician your choice is once again le pen or fillon . 
  * if you are socially conservative your choices are le pen or fillon . 
  * if you have been electing the same candidates for decades and want to try someone who never governed or been part of any coalition then le pen is the only choice . 
  * if you are really worried about islam then le pen is the go to candidate once again . 
  basically le pen is the only candidate possible for several niche opinions . 
  she is also seen as much more credible than trump as she has not done reality tv and other things like that , she is a professional politician with a lot of experience . 
  if we are perfectly honest , i think a lot of people voted trump in out of desperation and a sense of being betrayed too . 
  this is generally the reason this kind of people gets elected into office . 
  i am in favour of the eu but i would definitly approve of another kind of union . 
  i am a melenchon voter . 
  i do n't like what macron represents or his ideas but i do n't think he is going to bring any major catastrophes on france . 
  someone who votes for melenchon first round and le pen second round is more confused than scooby doo . 
  when you think melenchon electorate you have to imagine the `` refugee welcome '' crowd along with some greens allied with die hard communists . 
  you probably know someone from this kind of crowd , i will let you imagine them going to vote le pen . 
  haha yeah you can really imagine his supporters behind him thinking `` wtf is he rambling about ? '', 
  haha `` rends l'argent '' is probably the funniest of all to me . 
  especially because it infuriates fillon . 
  yeah i have nothing against belgian papers not following french law but very early polls are unreliable as hell . 
  melenchon is not an hardline eurosceptic , among the four you cited only le pen wants to leave unconditionally . 
  melenchon is against austerity . 
  he says basically that as long as eu does not prevent him from doing his programme he has no problem staying . 
  he will make a leave referendum only if eu starts trying to force him to enforce austerity measures and even then there will be negociations first to try and find a way to work together . 
  the leaving will only be a last recourse if there is no way to work a solution . 
  and even then there would still be a referendum french people could very well vote no to . 
  not that i know of . 
  generally parties try and respect that law . 
  then the law abiding citizen can do the same so there is no problem . 
  you ca n't prevent him doing all these things . 
  you can still prevent him from owning a gun . 
  some people are not criminals but are still idiots . 
  they are the most dangerous ones in my opinion . 
  no one knows right now as campaigns have been suspended since friday midnight until the closing of the voting booths ( this is the law in france ) . 
  it means that candidates and their teams no longer have the right to speak publicly ( they do n't even have the right to update their website ) and polls can not be published . 
  last polls gave macron and le pen around the same score with melenchon and fillon right behind them . 
  you will have to wait for our out of the booths polls published around 8pm like us or if you are in hurry go check belgian websites but keep in mind that the belgian generally publish them too early for them to be truly reliable . 
  it is seen as very nosey and materialistic . 
  this is kind of hypocritical since everyone wants to know but asking is rude somehow . 
  it probably wo n't cause an actual physical fight but you depending on the people you may be received coldly . 
  at least we would no longer have to worry about daesh and the rise of nationalisms . 
  haha , so triggered . 
  `` so , how much do you earn ? '', 
  i think most of the time it 's a bit over the top to do it on the hands or face but people should be free to do it but i guess i can kind of understand why they would do such a law . 
  i always sit at home to avoid splashes . 
  even if you do n't see it there are always mini drops of piss getting everywhere because of the high altitude of your dick when you stand . 
  sitting down makes it easier to keep your toilets clean . 
  in public places i only ever touch the toilet seat if i have to take a shit so i would piss standing . 
  getting tattooed on the hands or face is illegal in your country ? 
  it 's getting more and more common . 
  i like it and i may have one myself one day . 
  my girlfriend has three medium sized pieces and they are pretty cool . 
  thing is tattoos are the kind of things you should not be stingy with , get a very good one even if it is more expensive . 
  it may hurt your wallet on the moment but you will be glad after a year or two when the money got back in and you still have a great tattoo instead of a shitty one . 
  that 's mighty grand of you , mate . 
  also can you fucking kill bono ? 
  even if he just dies peacefully in his bed or something , it would be okey . 
  yeah i guess russia would be correct too , i just wish they had a non crazy person as their leader but i love russian history and language . 
  sure boudin is great !, 
  i am sure most people can place louisiana but thanks for taking the time . 
  yeah i do n't even recall the last time i had a bar of soap at home but my mother loves le petit marseillais and i would guess it 's one of the most popular here . 
  the two dots are used in french so we do have it on our keyboards . 
  i do n't know it 's alsatian language that 's all . 
  i did not make the language . 
  the fun thing is that alsatians generally call it `` tarte flamb\u00e9e '' and not by the german name . 
  in alsatian it is `` fl\u00e0mmenk\u00fceche '' . 
  you may be right . 
  duck is kind of an acquired taste . 
  i love it but not everyone does . 
  i really love the fn fal look for some reason . 
  it looks a bit retro and cool as fuck . 
  when i think about it i always imagine south african mercenaries fighting bitterly in jungles or something . 
  i did not see any restaurant making french comfort food . 
  the only french restaurants i saw in the us were gastronomic . 
  realizing that i thought that there was a great business opportunity there as most of these dishes are inexpensive ( most of them were dishes the farmers ate after a long day of work in the fields ) , easy as fuck to make in bulk and delicious . 
  example of dishes i am thinking about from the top of my head : tartiflette ( potato gratin with reblochon cheese bacon and onions ) galettes bretonnes : buckwheat cr\u00eapes with savory things ( the ones in france make a ridiculous 80 % margin on average because they cost fuck all to make , you can even go further if you have a great emplacement with a view or something ) onion soup cassoulet : beans and duck meat stew from southwest of france flammenkuechen ( ultra thin bread dough pies with cream , onion and bacon from alsace ) bouillabaisse ( fish stew ) blanquette de veau ( veal with cream and mushrooms ) carbonnade flamande ( beef stew with pain d'\u00e9pices + beer sauce ), 
  probably poland and romania . 
  yep , it is also used this way . 
  my grandpa yeah . 
  got drafted as an artillery nco because he was a school teacher and therefore knew mathematics , therefore he was responsible for one cannon , one horse and a few men . 
  his battery got ordered to deploy in some place . 
  they then never heard from hq again . 
  ended up being captured when a panzer division appeared behind them and they did not have time to turn the cannons around . 
  i feel like his story is a good example of the state of confusion that reigned when french and british armies nearly got surrounded by the germans and a lot of units got left behind in the retreat that followed . 
  he then spent the war in a pow camp . 
  apparently he thought the germans treated them okey . 
  he mainly had guards that were too old to fight on the frontlines and who just wanted to do their job and nothing more .

i feel bad for the british , as they were simply fed lies . 
  however i would be quite happy when the uk definitely leaves , it is one of the few countries that hinders more european integration , without mentioning the special treatment it has . 
  only the fn is blaming the eu . 
  the majority of people who are dissatisfied are not blaming the eu , but the successive governments ' economic policies . 
  the french do not particularly love the eu , but we generally do n't want to get out . 
  the majority here just want big reforms as to the functioning of the eu . 
  please , explain how she would win ? 
  genuine question . 
  personally , i will wait for the results of our right wing primary to eventually join those who denigrate the people saying that france will be next . 
  we can rightfully be arrogant here , because the people who wants to donaldify france on reddit do not know at all how it works here . 
  donald people would only be able to cheer if sarkozy wins the primary , due to how much we hate him . 
  for all other outcomes , france will have very little chance to fall into a brexit or donald kind of idiocy . 
   suffrage universel direct uninominal majoritaire \u00e0 deux tours you could have written the english equivalent , that is , a two-round system . 
  https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/d%c3%a9put%c3%a9_fran%c3%a7ais#a you should inform yourself on the topic . 
  if you count that this way , most of our senators are elected within 4 rounds . 
  france does n't have a winner takes all system . 
  we have a two round system for almost everything . 
  yeah , the burqini ban which was put in place in 15 + cities on the 36k that counts france , and overruled by the administrative supreme court . 
  so fascist . 
  really . 
  then how was alain jupp\u00e9 able to teach there after he was condemned ? 
  pupils can take catalan as an option ( as i see that competitive examination to become a catalan teacher exists ) . 
  of course i do n't think that catalan threatens french in any way . 
  simply that it 's not the problem of the french state . 
  well you have a very basic and narrow definition of democracy . 
  in a democracy such as ours , the majority rules . 
  what 's more the state rules for everyone in the frame of the constitution that defines it . 
  our constitution recognizes no specific culture . 
  so no state aid to revive the catalan culture . 
  no recognition of the catalan language as an official language . 
  if you want to revive your culture , do it yourself . 
  people complain about nanny states , but some people ask for even more ... 
   it actually is your problem . 
  how so ? 
  not my problem if the spanish do n't respect their constitution . 
  i really do n't care about how spanish deal with it . 
  we 're talking about france . 
  it 's not our problem if catalan culture is dying or whatever . 
  well , it 's not happening . 
  i mean , it 's basic french republican tradition :  article 1  france shall be an indivisible republic . 
  therefore no communities with specific treatment from the state . 
   article 2  the language of the republic shall be french . 
  an adminstrative region is simply called occitanie and you call that destruction , whereas you can find signs in french catalonia reading `` pays catalan '' when you you enter it ... what do you want the french state to do ? 
  one point of his economic programme is basically :  inject 100 billion in the economy  ??? 
  what did he say ? 
  we can only hope that fillon obviously losing will force their ( sane ) voters to vote for macron rather than le pen . 
  it 's sad we need to count on fillonists supporters to save the eu . 
  populism of the left and the right are at maximum capacity in this election , unfortunately . 
  yes , but his opponents usually circlejerk about his not having any programme even though he has one . 
  this is one of the main argument of the melenchonists on r/france for instance , and a very weak one as you can imagine . 
  no it 's not harder to sell as people usually view civil servants in a bad light . 
  he just wants not to replace retiring civil servants in local collectivities . 
  they 're employing too many anyway . 
   put simply , to me it 's the will of the financial/corporation world dominating the will of the people and their governments . 
  which is not what macron is advocating for . 
  but you have to live with corsicans, 
  i would personally love it . 
  and it would n't work anyway . 
  our presidents are womanizers ; they have mistresses , hidden children , die of a blowjob , they are single , divorced , they cheat on their girlfriend in the middle of their mandate ... and nobody gives a fuck . 
  a gay president ? 
  it would spice things up . 
  people would make jokes about it . 
  how would we call his husband or his boyfriend ? 
  premier monsieur ? 
  but in the end , very few people would care . 
  first , i did not say that you had little knowledge as to the muslim world , but your arguments led me to believe so , thus why i used '' seem '' . 
  indeed i do not know you enough . 
  you base your arguments on legislations and not on the social acceptance of homosexuality . 
  i am arguing that a significant part of muslims do n't care , and do n't act as bad as eastern europeans do , regardless of legislations . 
  i am talking about everyday interactions . 
  though i am certainly not saying that muslims are all gay friendly , but gay friendliness among them is certainly not rare . 
  you seem to have very little knowledge as to how the muslim world is diverse . 
  and i would n't take pew polls as example of the * french * muslim population , which i am more enclined to talk about . 
  if we were to speak about the anti-lgbt sentiment , i would be indeed wary of muslims to some extent , but also wary of poles and eastern europeans too . 
  but there 's a trend to put them all in the same bag , whereas a lot of them are `` fine '' with it ; as fine as for instance a big chunk of reddit : the kind of people who `` do n't care '' . 
  most of them indeed `` do n't care '' or do not care enough for it to be consequential . 
  you keep waving the `` neoliberalism '' flag but i do n't think you know what it means . 
  if you think that the current ps is neoliberal ... 
  he 's also constitutionally bound to preserve the continuity of the state and the application of treaties , as well as the best interest of the french people . 
  all of which would be more or less threatened under a le pen presidency . 
  and the president is * de facto * a politician because he will in one way or another participate in politics . 
  my two cents as a gay french guy : my best friend is muslim and i found out that moderate muslims seem to be very gay friendly . 
  it is sad however that the fn has targeted these families , mixing them with hardcore muslims , when often they very much dislike each other . 
  political scientists study statistics , trends , opinions shifting , demographics . 
  you 'll never read a political scientist as opinionated as to write `` this or this is facist because ... '' . 
  if one wants to argue that the fn is a facsist party , then you should compare what the fn advocates for in correlation with the definition of fascism . 
  it seems to me that the fn used to be indeed fascist-like pre-marine . 
  and it seems to be quite ironical to complain about arguments ad nauseam when yourself writes arguments ad hominem . 
  people moaning about the french `` elites '' usually moan about ena ( or to a lower extend , hec ) alumni . 
  since when are those mutually exclusive ? 
  i can only count two or three hardcore communist french redditor who are vocal about it . 
  the others are just normal left-leaning people . 
  but as usual you have a tendency to hyperbolize anything and everything . 
  ( and voting m\u00e9lenchon is not a proof of being a communist . ), 
  i am more enclined to think that they disappeared because they wanted to , not because of outside circumstances . 
  politicians who suffer from harsh political blows who want to come back always do , even though weaker . 
  and raffarin is still politically active , as far as i know . 
  politicians careers never die in france, 
  he repeatedly said he does n't want to get involved in the eu for now . 
   a person rejects the biological imperative of reproduction .

  excellent !, 
  * does it bring back some memories ? 
  the synth is simply brilliant . 
  `` all the french do is talk . '', 
    no nation could exist for a week if all it did was talk . 
    french men enjoy conversation . 
  they consider it an art . 
  they are on the whole , skillful at it . 
    we do n't prize `` good conversation '' as much as the french do . 
    it was the brilliance , charm and imagination of french talk that contributed much to the reputation of paris as a world center of gaiety .

  my sister even failed her driving licence the first time because she had supposedly done that and the examiner had used that expression as well ( she swears she did n't of course ) . 
  the world has gotten small . 
  everyone is my neighbor . 
  i 'll add a few : * c'est pas le p\u00e9rou ( * it 's not peru * ) : it 's not much , it 's mediocre . 
  * faire son stop \u00e0 l'am\u00e9ricaine ( * stopping at a stop sign like an american * ) : slowing down but not actually stopping at the stop sign . 
  * la branlette espagnole ( * spanish `` hand job '' * ) ... when a man and a woman like each other very much and the lady 's breasts are large enough ... * filer \u00e0 l'anglaise ( * run the british way * ) : run away discreetly . 
  i 've taken to using the old slang for the francs . 
  i so wish i could go back to living in [ strasbourg ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/strasbourg ) . 
  it 's the perfect city for me : it 's close enough to my home town that i could visit regularly but far enough to avoid unexpected visits ( 2 hours drive ) . 
  les vosges are close by , so is germany ( strasbourg-kehl is super quick , even when using the city bus like i did as a student ) . 
  it 's just such a gorgeous city . 
  of course , it 's a pretty touristy city but where i live now is even worse so ... 
  is there really no , i do n't know what word to use , not pride but some ... 
  i do n't know , sense of ` belonging ' , maybe to what used to be the ddr ? 
  you know we got to vote on what the new name was going to be . 
  one of the choice was nouvelle [ austrasie ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/austrasia ) . 
  which i thought was pretty cool , with a nice historical ring to it but noooo . 
  and you know what 's the one thing people did n't like about it ? 
  `` we ca n't call ourselves austrasie , that sounds too much like australie '' . 
  now that 's an interesting question . 
  i do n't know how it is in germany but in france the line that divides northern and southern france depends on who you 're talking to . 
  i had a friend from marseilles and he un-sarcastically considered anything north of avignon as `` le nord '' ( granted , he was a bit extreme ) . 
  my boyfriend 's grandfather from nowhere , central france is incapable of making the distinction between the alsace-lorraine region and le nord / pas de calais ( as in , lille , dunkerque , all that ) . 
  still not sure if stupid or just doing it to piss me off . 
  * my * division line starts around nantes . 
  i consider lyon in the south , someone else may consider lyon northern ... xd but usually , `` le nord de la france '' refers to what is now les hauts-de-france region . 
  ca n't believe eastern people went for that lame ass name ` grand-est ' ... but i digress . 
  edit : as for the stereotypes about brittany and normandy , i 'm not sure . 
  i do n't think so . 
  i 'm full of prejudices against brittany but that 's just because i 'm sick of seeing their flag everywhere . ^ / s, 
  not for that particular stereotype no , i meant the nord-pas-de-calais former region mostly . 
  there was this [ big criminal case ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/outreau_trial ) in 2004 that did nothing to help with those stereotypes ( even though the vast majority of the people accused turned out innocent ) . 
  * people from norhtern france : alcoholics , incestuous . 
  * north eastern french : lovely * german * people ( have been called a boche a few times on the rare occasions i visited some family down south : `` where do you come from ? '', 
  [ answers ] `` oh , you 're practically german ! '' ), 
  * parisians : rude assholes who ca n't drive . 
  * marseilles : crime lords from corsica, 
  aaow , man . 
  while i always thought resistance could get away with a few more rules for some reason 2/3 of the group of friends i usually play with tend to lose half their brain when we play that game . 
  so i 'll find smarter friends , then i 'll play the game . 
  got it \\ ^ \\ ^, 
  yes , i was speaking of battlestar galactica and if it 's like resistance then i 'll definitely check it out next time i head to the game store !, 
  thanks, 
  is it really ? 
  i meant to try it out with a couple of friends because i 'm a huge fan of the show but ... you know , never did . 
  i think it 's safe to say 7 wonders is relatively popular here . 
  my favorite is the resistance : avalon . 
  love that game . 
  riiiight , i had forgotten about louisiana !, 
  now , \u00e0 propos de l'accent qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois ... you know how some accents can be really hot ? 
  ( i have a thing for the spanish and italian accents ) . 
  the quebecois accent is n't of of them ( to me anyway ) . 
  when i can understand what the people are saying , i find it amusing . 
  one day i watched a news show whose anchor had a pretty thick accent and man , nothing that woman said sounded serious to me . 
  i kept giggling at the funny pronunciations , no matter what horrible topic she was talking about . 
  it 's childish , i know . 
  i would n't know . 
  there are n't many americans with french ancestry ( never met any ) . 
  * ( edit : had n't thought about louisiana . 
  i stand corrected ) * as for the french canadians , it 's a little different is n't it ? 
  qu\u00e9bec being a thing and them trying to preserve some form of cultural identity vs the overwhelming english speaking majority of the country ? 
  vive la france ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iazfvfdietk ) said de gaulle . 
  i think you wo n't find many french disagreeing with that statement . 
  there is a real sympathy for our canadian cousins , 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9xzrraqfza ) xd, 
  that 's a mistake many french would make . 
  it 's similar to mistaking * j' aurai * ( futur simple ) and * j' aurais * ( conditionnel ) . 
  you ca n't hear the difference so the mistake is understandable . 
  i 've only just started studying spanish ( like a month ago ) . 
  i 'm enjoying it , it 's fun  if you 've studied french you probably heard of it but the tv series kaamelott is a gold mine of french colloquialisms ( and is actually very funny ) . 
  `` va te faire chier '' is n't a thing . 
  it would be understood as `` go get bored somewhere '' . 
  `` se faire chier '' can mean to be bored . 
  it can also be used when you try to convey the fact that you put a lot of effort into something `` je me suis fait chier \u00e0 faire [ un truc ] '' . 
  and so , `` ne pas se faire chier '' means you 're being impolite . 
  would be an appropriate comment for someone cutting the line at the supermarket for example . 
  you 'd indeed say `` va te faire foutre '' ( no 's ' for the imperative form ) / `` va te faire enculer '' . 
  or use the euphemism `` va te faire voir chez les grecs '' . 
  which is indeed quite vulgar . 
  or , another possibilty is `` tu m 'em merdes '' , litt : you 're dirtying me with shit but it completely lost that meaning . 
  although `` o\u00f9 tu vas ? '', 
  `` me faire emmerder '' before someone says `` je t 'em merde '' . 
  that works . 
  thanks !, 
  the belgian accent is easily understandable ( and rightfully mocked ) . 
  feels like a different language altogether sometimes . 
  i 've never been much good with accents but i 've seen videos from quebec where i understood very little of what was being said xd the other day there were a couple of canadians next to me on the street , they talked with the weirdest mix of ( to me ) american souding english and distorted ( again to me ) french . 
  it was hilarious ( and very difficult to follow ) : o, 
  thanks a lot for the explanation . 
  my grandmother would have loved that expression indeed . 
  similarly we have `` va te faire cuire un oeuf '' ( go make yourself an egg ) . 
  i usually steam my asparagus a little before frying them , some cook them in water a bit . 
  i have another question !, 
  i was watching a video in spanish where one person got very annoyed with the other one and the dialogue went : - `` me voy !, 
  i can relate that to two different french expressions , i 'm wondering which one fits the intended meaning best . 
  when something bothers you very much , you say , '' \u00c7a me fait chier ! '', 
  ( litt : it makes me shit ) . 
  you could also say `` va chier '' ( litt : go take a shit ) . 
  note that it is possible to scream `` va chier '' to nobody in particular when something goes wrong . 
  i 've heard it a couple of times on various videos , i 'm curious ( also , love spanish cursing !,

  basically this is the french position on the matter , it 's about dissuasion on the use of chemical weapons and to send a political signal . 
  it 's not really a military matter * per se * it is not about pushing assad out of power . 
  so i think they are waiting for official u.n. proof of the use of chemicals , not a `` colin powell '' kind of proof , and they are handpicking the targets of potential strikes to send the right message and making clear in the meantime they are not trying to overthrow the regime . 
  my 2 cents . 
  hey , i understood this one . 
  the funny thing is i do n't speak portuguese , just french and a bit of spanish, 
  even more confusing is seeing this news more commented and upvoted in / r/europe than in / r/space ... 
  i agree with you , but many of the webcams available on the link i gave earlier are not in public location . 
  quite a few of them are private feeds : inside shops , inside offices , inside houses , toddler nanycams ... etc and i believe many supposedly private feeds can be accessed with a bit of technical knowledge/hacking, 
  yeah , but if someone like me with no technical knowledge can access it , i can only imagine what can do the `` people in power '' ... 
  you might be right , but it is so easy to gain access to those `` private '' cameras ... http://livesecuritycams.com/, 
  does considering oneself basque correlate with being pro-independence ? 
  genuine question , i 'm sure a lot welsh , alsatian , corsican or whatever , have a very strong cultural identity but would n't be willing to become independent . 
  i guess you 're right . 
  i did n't think about it this way . 
  but maybe it would n't be unreasonable to think there is a correlation between population and job opportunities : more people also means more companies , more shops , more services needed , more jobs available ? 
  i 'm surprised to see so few europeans in england and germany , below 4 % . 
  compare to other countries like spain , iceland , norway or ireland , all above 5 % . 
  i thought england , with the advantage of the language , the city being the financial capital of europe , the hype about how great it is for new companies and the like ... and germany as the continental powerhouse and industrial leader would have drawn a much bigger crowd . 
  it is usually how the media depict them in france at least ; berlin being invaded par poor spaniard and other southern europeans and london being the sixth most populated french city and drawing all the new businessmen in this liberal paradise ...

  well , i said `` most of it '' . 
  anyway i do n't remember such a widespread feeling about the french before the irak war ( 2003 ) more specifically . 
  what is worst is that most of it came after france decided not to follow the u.s and the u.k. in the irak war not because of the surrendering to germany in wwii . 
  before this time , i do n't think this belief was held , even in anglophone circles . 
  it 's a negative pr campaign more than anything else , but a successful one and for a lot of people we are now the `` cheese-eating surrender monkeys '', 
  yes , i thought about her too , but i guess the `` epic '' factor made me go father back in time and the example given by op was closer . 
  but yeah , i believe she fit the bill . 
  for france , it would be [ vercingetorix ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vercingetorix ) , he united the gauls and leads them in the fight against the romans and caesar . 
  i think he 's talking about the size reflecting the value : the smaller the value , the smaller the size . 
  if i remember correctly , your 2p coin is bigger than the 5p , which can be quite confusing when your not used to , i.e. 
  as a tourist . 
  talk about editorialized title ... 
  honestly , i think you should travel a bit . 
  i 've been lucky enough to be able to , and when you see what poverty can be , you feel lucky and not that poor . 
  for the record , it was n't a burqa . 
  burqa are almost unknown in france . 
  your submitted history : http://www.reddit.com/user/dominumformidas/submitted/ looks like / r/niggers, 
   delphine batho , minister of ecology , sustainable development and energy ( and member of the green party ) actually she 's not a member of the green party , she 's a socialist and she actually does n't know much about ecology . 
  it 's a wonder why she gets this minister in the first place because her field of competence is mostly security matters . 
  * the autopsy report stated that the death was the consequence of the blows not the fall * i was surprised how little the media talked about the `` nsa scandal '' considering how big it is, 
  i think he 's all right , you can see him get away on the left side [ of the truck ], 
   and what is she charged for ? 
     she said that muslims using the streets to pray because mosques were overflowing was an `` occupation '' of french territory . 
  oh look at this !, 
  oh is n't it terrible ?!, 
  racist !, 
  racist !, 
  she did n't just say that the street prayers were an occupation , she likened the sight of muslims praying in the streets to the nazi occupation of france . 
  and believe it or not , it 's a touchy subject here . 
   were n't their numbers lately suggesting that if the elections would be held again , she 'd win ? 
  no , the numbers did n't suggest that .

  here is an extract on the methodology :   eurostat produces harmonised unemployment rates for indi  vidual eu member states , the euro area and the eu . 
  these unemployment rates are based on the definition recommended by the international labour organisation ( ilo ) . 
  the  measurement is based on a harmonised source , the european union labour force survey ( lfs ) . 
   based on the ilo definition , euro  stat defines unemployed persons as persons aged 15 to 74 who :  - are without work ;  - are available to start work within the next two weeks ;  - and have actively sought employment at so  me time during the previous four weeks . 
   the  unemployment rate  is the number of people unemployed as  a percentage of the labour force . 
  the  labour force  is the  total number of people employed plus unemployed . 
  in this ne  ws release unemployment rates are based on employment and  unemployment data covering persons aged 15 to 74,

   people of arab descent , or religious muslims , do n't agree with us . 
  they want a religious state in syria . 
  it 's a wide generalization and a bold statement . 
  should i assume that all norwegians people agree with you ? 
  am i wrong if i think she put first the bi-lateral relationship between germany and china even if it 's detrimental to the europe as a whole ? 
  it 's a genuine question , i do n't know enough on the topic of low chinese solar panels and phone gear imported in the european market to make an informed opinion .

  this is bullshit . 
  after the 100 % tax the `` bouclier fiscal '' / `` the fiscal shield '' apply , which limit the rate to 50 % . 
  furthermore , we are talking about people with huge assets [ more than 1.5 million euro ] with very little income from wages , salary or stock dividends [ you do n't need a monthly income when you 've got `` savings '' in which to dig ] . 
  so yes , mechanically , the tax on theirs assets will easily be more than their income , because the income are artificially kept low to avoid taxes ... 
  i think it 's a recap of the `` poll '' . 
  or maybe i missed the sarcasm in your comment .

  an interesting read even for those unlikely to produce any eu publications , thanks op . 
  right . 
  plus it would be interesting to know if they 've taken into account the price to dismantle old nuclear power plants . 
  i believe they did n't . 
  because the s\u00e9nat will not just vote the text , but study it and can make ` amendments ' , modifications , which in turn will be studied by the national assembly and might be taken into account, 
  basically , the national assembly [ lower chamber ] is the first step . 
  then it goes to the s\u00e9nat [ upper chamber ] . 
  if the s\u00e9nat confirm , then the law is passed . 
  if the senat denies it , it goes back to the national assembly which will have the last word . 
  in this case , both chambers are on the same line so it 's already sure that the law is going to pass . 
  no , i 'm sorry , i made kind of a general statement . 
  obviously , it 's not all white or black , but overall i would say that france is n't split over this issue . 
  we do like beckham , and most peoples are glad he comes to play here , but we know that it 's mainly a communication and marketing operation for the qatari owners of the club in order to get some love and some money because psg is nothing in asia while beckham is huge over there . 
  qatar , paris st-germain owner , got a lot of heat in france right know . 
  about the fact that they bought and rigged the world cup 2022 , and because they are believed to have sent arms and ammunitions to terrorists in mali , which we are fighting right now . 
  and about the charity donation , nobody say it 's not great , because it is . 
  but the fact that when they announced it during the press conference , they did n't know yet which charity would benefits , let many peoples think it was more likely a last minute move and a pr thing . 
  tl ; dr the france is n't split over , we like beckham 's right foot , and he 's welcome .

  as a frenchman living in switzerland , i can ensure you that swiss cheese is just a sub-component of the diversity of french cheese . 
  tarte tatin  apple pie, 
   there are two things for which we are universally considered good : food and fashion . 
  the same two things for which we are universally considered the best . 
   also the french and swiss know their cheese . 
  how can you put switzerland and france in the same cheese league ? 
  french sandwitch ( baguette + jambon-beurre or rosette de lyon ) and boulangerie things ( friand , quiche ... ) are also a big thing . 
  after hitler , yes probably . 
  the pro-russia thing is exagerated . 
  he just want to cool down the relationship , he did n't say that putin is a great guy or something like that ( \u00e0 la trump ) . 
   seems to be some kind of le pen male version politically not at all , he 's more a thatcher male version . 
  he 's extremely liberal economically while lepen is extremely anti-liberal . 
  not really according to these definitions : http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=the%20clap a `` bifle '' is a slap of the dick on the face . 
   polls have lost their image as sources of credible information , so as an outsider i do n't see why it could n't end up being sarkozix le gaulois and le pen , with the latter winning . 
  why use the word `` impossible '' ? 
  because it 's impossible . 
  even with sarkozy . 
  trump was a different story because it 's a 1-turn vote and he was the candadidate of one of the 2 biggest ( to not say only ) parties of the us . 
  marine lepen will never be the candidate of the right , so she will have to face all the left-wing + the moderate right to win . 
  she absolutely can not win , it would be really really a huge surprise ( much more than brexit and trump combined ) . 
  i understand that the world is excited and nearly addicted to `` big surprises '' . 
  it becomes really ridiculous , she nearly already won for the anglophone press , but open your ears and stop to believe this shit , the french system and political landscape is not the same . 
  bifle, 
  it was `` unlikely '' , whereas le pen victory is just fucking `` impossible '' . 
  reddit and anglophone media look very excited by the idea , but the polls are clear : right now , it 's way more than unlikely . 
  france is exactly in the same position than uk for leaving the eu . 
  i do n't get why the world seems to believe that uk is way better than france economically , it 's not true , the two countries are on par . 
  also , she will not win , stop to believe the brit and us media . 
  trump and brexit should be enough to understand that they just say what they would like , and they really want to believe that france will follow them . 
  all the left , center and moderate right would vote sarko . 
  the only complicate situation would be hollande or melenchon vs lepen . 
  rendez-vous is a french idiom copy-paste from french to english . 
  it is actually rather smart to use a french expression that everybody knows ( because of its use by anglophone ) . 
  good guy barnier . 
  0 chance . 
  you will hear a lot of politicians saying that it 's possible to attract the attention and make believe that they 're the only alternative to save france from extremism . 
  a lot of media that will say that 's possible to sell journals . 
  do n't believe it , there is no scenario where she can win in our system . 
  france is the number one touristic destination for a good reason , you should be inspired and try to have a distinct culture and not a generic bullshit marketing sentence . 
  cop 21 + french diplomacy, 
  i abandon , you 're too stupid or pretend to be stupid . 
   the uk was absolutely involved in wwii the entire time . 
  for fuck sake , i known and that 's the fucking point . 
  while being involved in wwii the entire time ( vs less than 1 year for france ) , uk had less casualties than france . 
  it 's the perfect demonstration that france is more sensitive to conflict issues in europe ( and it 's fucking obvious , insularity disconecting the uk from the conflicts of the others ) . 
   it is due to the uk that france was even able to be liberated in the first place short of hoping it turned into a soviet republic by being occupied by the ussr eventually . 
  irrelevant to the discussion . 
   the uk also spends more on their military per gdp than france does currently . 
  and uk is not a independent nuclear power ( they rely on the usa ) and is behind france from a global military point of view : http://www.globalfirepower.com/countries-listing.asp . 
  yeah , that 's the point . 
  france has been occupied 4 years while the uk was free . 
  even with less than 1 year of war , france had more casualties than uk ( 600 000 vs 450 900 death ) . 
  if you ca n't see the insular advantage , there is nothing i can do for you . 
  the invasion of france was due to the defeat of both the uk and france . 
  france paid it cash , uk stayed largely unaffected by this massive rout . 
  it 's more than clear that there are reasons for the lack of concern of brits for continental europe . 
  no , something ike 40 % , including bruxelles . 
  you 're an island . 
  you were clearly not there all the time during ww1 and ww2 . 
  i did n't say that you did n't give a shit , but you 're clearly less impacted by the shit that 's going on the continent . 
  i would ` nt trust the brits . 
  brexit + trump clearly predict that an uk-usa axis will emerge ( even more strongly than what it was before ) , and their interest could be clearly disconnected from the eu interests . 
  trump does n't give a shit about europe and likes putin , brexit supporters nearly hate the eu . 
  the big difference is that american hegemony is real ( we have this debate in english , want a better proof ? 
  ) , the russian one is just delusional , particularly from the point of view of western europe . 
  i 'm clearly against le pen , but the putin puppet is not a good argument . 
  being a putin puppet or an american puppet ( as sarkozy and hollande were , see assange/snowden scandals ) is pretty much the same thing . 
  mostly , it would like to use the current french and british nuclear capabilities to protect not only these two nations but the whole europe ( european union ? ) . 
  the british ? 
  post-brexit ? 
   if the german government acts on this , would that mean they do n't trust the french , british , and american nuclear deterrence ? 
  trusting the british or american nuclear deterrence is pure madness . 
  eu should just pay france to ensure its nuclear deterrence . 
  just half of belgium . 
  the other half speaks dutch . 
  do what you want , but let us belgium . 
  nice new colony , uk . 
  yeah yeah , because ukraine can count on on the rest of the world to sing in ukrainian . 
  do n't be ridiculous , defending local culture is a way to defend cutural diversity . 
  very good thing . 
  cultural diversity has to be defended . 
  you can consider your language as officially dead . 
  lepen already won ? 
  i understand that anglophone press want to convert the failure of the anglosphere into a failure of the western world , but it will not happen . 
  uk and usa have clear excess of liberalism , but france is actually pretty balanced in this regard . 
  but it 's not in the eu , so not really like scotland and the uk . 
  sounds more like a common wealth member of the danish crown . 
  official weeaboo of the world actually . 
  culturally , francophone and belgium are really exactly the same thing . 
  i would also add francophone switzerland which is also nearly as crazy about mangas than france . 
  if you want an example , dragon ball was broadcast on the biggest frenc channel just 2 years after the japanese broadcast . 
  every single frenchmen that are 25-35 years old know immediately who 's sangoku or what is a kamehameha . 
  i was really shocked during a time 's up game when i realized that all the other players ( american , brits , chinese , italian , dutch ) where completely clueless whe i tried to make them guess dragon ball . 
  also , every single supermarket have a lot of mangas available . 
  i guess that this passion comes from the franco-belgian tradition of bd + the fact that both style complement very well each other ( bd are bigger , more beautiful but with less pages , mangas have more pages but the format is smaller and generally less beautiful/black and white ) . 
  same . 
  american comics are pure trash for me , but i really like mangas and franco-belgian bd . 
  is it really considered as denmark ? 
  there are by example some important differencesbetween the oversea territories of uk ( that are not really uk from a practical and legal point of view ) and oversea territories of france ( that are completely part of the eu with european deputies ) .

  forgive me but this comment is so out of this world to us . 
  let me tell you this : gun ownership may work in the us for historical reasons , but it does n't belong in europe so do n't waste your time arguing for it . 
  gun-free societies is one of the best things we have and we surely wo n't give it up to be like the us . 
  i would n't say fashionable but it 's common for sure . 
  at least most of the smokers i know have stopped using the braindead excuse `` got ta die one day lulz '' and are instead admitting that they 're in too deep to stop now . 
  all this shit with russia almost makes you wish for a nuclear winter . 
  because if your government found out a foreign power managed to break into highest-level coms , they would do absolutely nothing to stop the leak . 
  i know you guys need to make fun of us at least twice a day to survive , but this time please use logic instead . 
  london has what i like in paris : lots of culture and history , cool street names , the general feeling of an old european capital . 
  even i a ( royal ) baby-eating republican can enjoy the queen 's guards in silly hats . 
  so yeah like paris except with more silly hats and a cleaner subway . 
  also pubs every 20 m , which is nice . 
  and manky hookers in the alcoves . 
   i do n't trust the french to be really interested in stopping these people from sneaking into the uk if that was the case , we would put them on boats ourselves and wish them well on their way to be somebody else 's problem . 
  if we just let them through like you seem to believe , they would n't need to build camps in anticipation for failed attemps to cross , nor would they regularly [ clash with police ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmsvgx4si0i ) . 
  i 'm sure they are , but unless you make that a week 's worth of pastries and wine i think tourists from any country would jump at your throat for making them waste 5 hours and having the nerve to tell them you were at lunch ... simple business advice . 
  you guys are cute, 
  ok so is there a country , * any country * , where people do n't think we 're obnoxious assholes ? 
  i can empathise with the americans in terms of getting so much shit from every direction . 
  also , not german and i 'm going to sound salty as fuck but this ...  they arrive in the hotel at 8.50 am ( the hotel only opens at 9am ) . 
  at 9.15 am someone opens the gate of the hotel but says : `` i do n't have access to the rooms ... you have to wait for the owner , i 'm sorry '' . 
  finally at 11.30 am the owner arrives just to say : `` sorry , i forgot the key for your room ... 5 minutes and i 'm back , really sorry '' . 
  he 's back at 2pm and says : `` sorry , my wife had the lunch already made ... '' and gives a box to the german tourists at the same time he says : `` take this , my wife made some cod fish pastries ( pasteis de bacalhau ) ... and here 's a good wine '' . 
  in the end , the wine and the food compensate all the time they had to wait dude , it 's more like they 're too appalled at the appalling customer service and disrespectful behavior to say something . 
  5 hours delay compensated with fish pastries and wine , sure buddy . 
  nobody is zen enough to put up with that except buddhist monks . 
  thank god this paragraph is an exaggeration . 
  you know , i understand why that is . 
  if ice-dispenser fridges were more common in europe we would be using them all the goddamn time just for fun , then we 'd have to find a use for all the ice . 
  americans are strangely obsessed about putting ice in every drink .

  wait , now you edited your previous comment and made our exchange look completely different . 
  if you 're aware of his opinions and trolling , and that you disagree with it , why would you want someone like that as a moderator ? 
  that 's like saying a racist guy should be given a chance to become a cop . 
  no , he absolutely should not , because as a representative of authority he 's supposed to be reasonably unbiased and to treat everyone the same , which he has shown he ca n't do since he 's racist . 
  it does , thank you . 
  i personally did n't attribute any opinion to / r/serbia as a whole , i just wanted to point out how it reflected on them that the one person to specifically distance himself from the letter had to be a serbian . 
  for the sake of / r/serbia you should n't have gone out of your way like that , but what 's done is done . 
  there is no neutrality possible here . 
  either you acknowledge the genocide apologist or you admit you support him . 
  it 's a damn shame that you had / r/serbia singled out in the letter as `` non-signatory '' . 
  think of how bad it looks considering we 're discussing an apologist of serbian war criminals . 
  if you condemn it then go ahead and say it , if you support it then go ahead and say it but stop hiding behind `` neutrality '' . 
  so far your lack of a direct answer looks like a good indication of what you really think .

  if you go in france , you might feel we have tiny cars . 
  you will see a lot of berline like citroen c3 or c4 , renault clio , peugeot 206 , etc. 
  fuel efficiency is an important factor , and having a suv is a major pita in many cities , which were built way before car existed : small roads , small streets . 
  those cars cost around 15000 euros , which is a bit less than 1 year of the national median income .

  most of city center is much younger , with buildings being 300 years old or less .

  in paris , it 's quite popular , because there 's a big vietnamese community with plenty of places serving pho . 
  in most other part of the country , pho is harder to find , or not prominently advertised : it 's generic `` asian '' restaurants serving run-of-the-mill asian dishes popular in france : fried spring rolls , fried rice , etc. 
  compared to 20 years ago , there are more restaurants advertising themselves as vietnamese , not chinese , and have distinctly vietnamese dishes . 
  as more people traveled to vietnam for holidays , people get a better idea of what is vietnamese food . 
  tl ; dr : not yet , but getting there, 
  no , the garden , the terrace and the workshop/storage offers more enough space to hang our clothes .

  update 2 : report from [ l'express ] ( http://www.lexpress.fr/actualite/societe/fait-divers/une-prise-en-otage-en-cours-dans-une-eglise-en-seine-maritime_1815907.html?utm_campaign=echobox&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;link_time=1469523961#xtor=cs3-5083 ) , with quotes from a spokesperson of the police union : - the two men were armed with either swords or knives ; - hostages were a priest , two nuns and two churchgoers ; - one of the nuns escaped and alerted the police ; - one of the two men wore a `` prayer hat '' ; - apparently they slit the priest 's throat ( unconfirmed ) update 3 : okay , so about all news sources are confirming that the priest was killed . 
  [ le point ] ( http://www.lepoint.fr/societe/en-direct-prise-d-otages-dans-une-eglise-pres-de-rouen-26-07-2016-2057039_23.php ) is reporting that another of the hostages was killed and that a policeman was injured . 
  unconfirmed for the moment . 
  they 're also saying that the two men were bearded and that they screamed `` daesh ! '', 
  when entering the church . 
  also hollande and cazeneuve will very soon be on site and probably give more info . 
  update 4 : according to a spokesperson from the ministry of the interior , just interviewed , the priest is confirmed dead and a second hostage is `` between life and death '' . 
  nothing particular about the uk , all governments are looking to limit , or sometimes ban , e2e encryption . 
  to add weight to this , when the lisbon treaty created the post of `` president of the european union '' , the first idea was to completely replace the revolving presidency system ( by which one country presides by turn ) , and to name a strong , widely recognised , politically important figure ( tony blair was one of the names put forward ) . 
  both were shot down because states did n't want to lose any power . 
  eu regulations are full of cases like this . 
  i always thought putin wants trump to be elected because he feels he would walk all over him . 
  he probably would , too . 
  do n't forget qatar 's investments . 
  another sponsor of islamism . 
  yes , your idea that justice = vengeance is stupid caveman mentality . 
  not my words but yours . 
  and are you seriously comparing singapore , a very wealthy city-state , with larger , much larger countries , with bigger populations and the like ? 
  you can only compare what 's comparable . 
  also , how about checking out these two maps ?

  ] ( http://i.huffpost.com/gen/1730562/original.jpg ) i 'll let you draw your own conclusions . 
  your final paragraph is idiotic . 
  not only is it a deformation of what i wrote , but it 's nothing more than a big strawman . 
  crime rates in france , the uk , germany are much , much lower than in the usa . 
  i 'll also add that the fact that you actually think that the death penalty `` strikes fear into criminals '' shows how delusional you are . 
  i 'll just repeat myself , saying that justice is not vengeance , and leave it at that . 
  you can keep rambling on about `` teh nobility '' , or about how europe is a warzone if you want . 
  aw , sorry , did n't get the joke . 
  i do n't know if its a recent trend on reddit , though , i 've seen the `` republican catalonia vs fascist madrid '' narrative pop up elsewhere , especially in the context of the bar\u00e7a - madrid rivalry . 
  there 's also the fact that orwell 's homage to catalonia is one of the most famous books written about the civil war . 
  but yeah , it 's historically stupid . 
  quick aside but the story of the siege of madrid , while horrifying , is also amazing in the bravery shown by the republicans . 
  love [ this ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8f/%c2%a1no_pasar%c3%a1n%21_madrid.jpg/800px-%c2%a1no_pasar%c3%a1n%21_madrid.jpg ) image . 
  the death penalty is a barbaric practice that gives the state power of life and death over people . 
  it does not deter criminals , it does n't help the protection of society . 
  it also satisfies a basic , primal need for vengeance . 
  vengeance and justice are two very different things . 
  politics is not always about just doing systematically what the majority wants at any given point . 
  that 's the demagogue 's way . 
  sometimes , once in a blue moon maybe , some politicians actually fight to implement what they truly believe is in the national interest and the general betterment of society , even if its unpopular or not supported by a majority in opinion polls ( and are opinion polls a basis for democracy now ? ) . 
  by the way , the echr has nothing to do with the eu . 
  yes , we can definitely see the region becoming peaceful and stable in the next 10 years . 
  it 's clearly on that path . 
   the invasion created an unforeseen clusterfuck bull-fucking-shit . 
  it was foreseeable , and foreseen . 
  was n't madrid one of the main centres of resistance against franco , though ? 
  you do n't even need any of the recent attacks anywhere for a thread like that . 
  tragedies happen every single day . 
  did n't farage say something like that ? 
  like `` there are huge traffic jams on our roads because there are too many people because immigration ? '', 
  there 's a nice little 2 year window for leaving after art . 
  50 is invoked . 
  the reality is just that the uk is playing for time to try and weasel its way into some kind of deal where they 'll have all the advantages of the eu and none of the obligations . 
  yes , i definitely do . 
  i also believe that governments wo n't do too much though and ultimately private individuals should.take matters in their own hands and reclaim as much privacy as they can . 
  one was caused by the other though . 
  what i 'm really saying is how fast everyone forgot about banks . 
  and the usa is n't protectionist ? 
  you 're delusional . 
  eh , us policy towards the eu is ambivalent . 
  they want the eu to be strong enough to be a reliable ally , but do n't wa n't the eu to be strong enough to become a rival . 
  i 'm still amazed at how fast the narrative shifted from banks causing a gigantic crisis to `` governments are spending too much , austerity is the answer ! '', 
  in such a short span of time . 
  to elaborate , the government used article 49-3 of the constitution , which states that the government can force a bill even if parliament does n't want it . 
  basically what happens is that the vote on the bill is replaced by a vote of no-confidence . 
  if the no-confidence vote fails , the bill is adopted despite not having been directly voted . 
  if the no-confidence vote succeeds , the government is toppled . 
  british people : `` we want to leave !, 
  take back control ! '', 
  eu : `` ok then , leave . '', 
  british people : `` what !, 
  how dare you give us orders ! '', 
  special snowflakeism at its best . 
  yes , because clearly inventive techs need to harvest their clients ' data . 
  who cares for privacy , the digital age is here . 
  did you miss the part where france was one of main driving forces behind the `` right to be forgotten '' regulations , is one of the most aggressive at enforcing it , and sent in police and tax inspectors busting in at google france 's headquarters ? 
  really ? 
  that 's your first reaction ? 
  i always read that the uk was ready to use nuclear weapons as retaliation for prior nuclear attack . 
  i 'll look into it more , i guess !, 
  ( though , to be fair , nuclear doctrines are always pretty hazy - you have to maintain some ambiguity , i guess ) . 
  i thought it was the reptilian overlords ? 
  yeah , they do that here as well as well . 
  i guess it 's a way of telling the new pm or president `` fun 's over , now you 're in charge of the serious stuff '' . 
  we say that heads of state and government have lost a lot of meaningful power , but this is one occasion where we give them the most crushing power mankind has ever known , * and they 're the only ones who can decide to use it * . 
  it 's fascinating , really . 
  the usa , uk , india , pakistan , have , i think , but am apparently wr a no first use policy ( ironically , the official acronym is nofun ) . 
  france ( dissuasion du faible au fort ) and possibly isra\u00ebl ( the samson option ) do n't . 
  not sure about china or russia . 
  edit : apparently the uk does n't have no first use .

  thank you , 
  was not my intention to be rude , just make a silly joke . 
  but apparently , my sense of humour is just poor and from bad taste . 
  all in good spirit mate . 
  i was n't expecting my crappy sense of humour being so `` popular '' here :(, 
  difference ? 
  litteraly the volume , you do n't have the critical mass of muslim migrant to cause as much problem as in europe . 
  oh and an ocean protecting you from massive , out of control immigration ( hence selection over the muslims coming in north america ) . 
  completely retarded statement , the part of muslim immigrant in north american is insignificant at most . 
  on top of that , it did n't prevent the boston bombing . 
  * than no ? 
  before the downvote , i 'm genuinely asking ... edit : ffs , i 'm not even allowed to ask an english question ? 
  goddamit , it 's not my fucking native language , mistakes of others can be confusing to me . 
  basic human rights ? 
  sounds like enough to me . 
   if french still have pride we do have pride , always had it and will keep having pride . 
  i 'm neither a pro or a anti fn , but this is just the shittiest comment they could do . 
  just commit seppuku and start again with the new heir . 
  just research a new tech and spend some diplomatic and administrative power . 
  they wo n't prevent me to attend any sport event or go to any concert . 
  i was planning to come back definitely in france in january and i refuse to let them win . 
  fuck those guys . 
  it 's not , it was n't an hostage situation , it was a slaughter ( at least in the bataclan ) . 
  my first thought was more about a defective explosive . 
  it would have been worse than everything else if he would have wait for the end of the game . 
  there is a couple of major alley where all the stadium is going through to join the metro or train . 
  i 'm kinda relieved that it did n't happen like this . 
  no , more of a masochist when you end up like this . 
  i could rule over europe with nords without considering feudality a single time . 
  yeah , you are right , a very unpleasant way to pollute our oceans . 
  all those salty tea ? 
  edit : a certain boston party people ? 
  edit 2 : apparently , the brits ca n't into british humour . 
  i do n't see how this is incompatible . 
  you can be really against immigration , but still respect human decency . 
  : myself , i do n't support mass immigration waves we are facing and especially how we handle it ( or rather how are politician are handling it ) . 
  but on the other hand i ca n't support that kind of shitty behavior . 
  maybe we can come to an agreement on some things rosbeef ... 
  ok , tonight i start a new campaign just aimed at crushing every single trace of flamish culture in existence . 
  you triggered it !, 
  so giving people money for life ( on top of being completely immoral ) , is cheaper than encouraging them to stay where they are ? 
  we do n't have job nor future for them , are we going to stay in that situation for ever ? 
  how fair is it for the active population ? 
  do n't make it like they are entitled to more . 
  they are n't entitled to shit . 
  we are already helping them , they will not be of any value for the society , it 's completely artificial to `` inject '' money in the local economy this way . 
  i 'm ok with helping people in need , but at the first sign of them making demands , they can go back to where they come from . 
  let 's see on the long term how it turns out for everyone . 
  and this article show how effective it actually is , 
  discussing semantic about an imaginary concept is a bit silly xd, 
  tourist do n't , neither to they receive shelter or food , hence the idea of `` premium tourists '', 
   when an official says `` the uk 's worse than 1984 '' you kind of get tired of that rubbish . 
  this was a stupid generalization from someone who has n't read the book . 
  i feel pretty comfortable while saying that attacks on my privacy are 1984 methods . 
  hence , making a point on how far we have been in terms of citizens spying . 
  it 's two different way of illustrating a point . 
   the the comparisons are stupid . 
   so you have to stick up and take all books literally to raise criticism against an idea ? 
  ever heard about metaphors ? 
  quotations ? 
  have you ever had philosophy classes ? 
  we do n't need the whole work of someone to illustrate a point . 
  the same applies here , a part of 1984 is about the suppression of the most fundamental privacy , it is appropriate in that argument . 
  we do n't need to literally talk about firemen and burning books to use farheneit 451 while talking about censorhip . 
   well there was the story about porn filters were people seemed to be under the impression porn was banned and the uk would leave the eu to access porn ... what a fountain of knowledge that discussion was . 
  which is not the topic here , thank you . 
   is the uk waking people up in the morning and forcing them to exercise in front of telescreens ? 
   ** somehow ** , not literally . 
  and english is n't my native language . 
   where did i say it did n't exist ? 
  by saying reddit is n't a good source of information precisely on a thread where we are arguing on a very concrete and real threat . 
   i 'm saying a subreddit which constantly draws comparisons to 1984 . 
   which is somehow appropriate to that point , but a very retarded big brother . 
   i was only saying reddit 's not the best place to get informed on this . 
  so you are denying that this law proposal does n't exist ? 
  just telling you that talking about the uk culture while dealing with a world wide technology issue is completely irrelevant . 
  i may be poorly informed on the uk , but dealing with information security regulation and cryptography is my work . 
  i do n't have to know about the uk to know how dumb , unrealistic and dangerous this law is . 
  why are we giving them money on the first place ? 
  is n't giving them food and shelter good enough ? 
  i thought they were war refugees , not fucking premium tourists . 
   immigrants taking your social benefits in your free country i 'm not scared of that , they are not entitled to anything , we are just dealing with the problem the worst way possible . 
  we have no long term plan for those people , we have no job , no money and no future for them . 
  and each and everyone of them believe they are here for good . 
  what are you going to do , create job and an economy out of your arse for those people ? 
  why not starting by helpings the millions of jobless people in europe first ? 
  why not start by helping the homeless in our own country ? 
  i have had enough of europe being always the savior of humanity . 
  he is not the leader we deserve , be the one we need . 
  if you are supporting the idea of eu , you 'll find a couple of them around here , 
  how many are actually from syria and has n't bought a passport for a couple of hundreds dollars ? 
  no seriously , we are having tons of economic migrant joining the same migration flux , and the least in need were the first to arrive . 
  does n't he have the right for self determination ? 
  except that the un refugee charta does n't make afghan , pakistani , algerian , turkish people and so on refugees . 
  ok , let 's make this man president of europe . 
  like , now . 
  you are a bit ridiculous with that kind of statement . 
  barely a querel . 
  we are forever allies , no matter what century , year or weather , 
  and the saxons were mostly spread in denmark , england and a bit of northern germany last i checked ;-),

   there were 1800 rapes so 1800/365 is about 5 rapes a day . 
  so without any muslim population you still get 5 per day . 
   ( 1782 incidents last year ) 1700 people died in poland because of cows last year . 
  wtf ? 
   you 'd rather be raped than raped and beaten half to death . 
  you sure love moving that goal post . 
  if you get beaten after you are raped , that means you got beaten . 
  that does n't mean you got raped a second time . 
  are you for real ? 
  edit : itt people that think being raped by someone you know is better than being raped by a stranger . 
  so they vote for bibi or hamas . 
  great job guys . 
  they really took  if you want peace prepare for war to heart . 
   those rape rape is rape is rape . 
  there is no better or worse rape . 
  who ? 
  the guys that wan na destroy israel or the guys that colonise the west bank ? 
  of the guys that bomb . 
   stopping gulf carriers from launching more routes to europe through lobbying efforts . 
  i do n't mind that . 
  gulf carriers do n't exactly treat their workers fairly . 
   happens on a daily basis now . 
  i mean rape does happen ** a lot ** in our societies . 
  12000 rapes in france last year . 
  why did you add the `` now '' part though ? 
   peace can not exist in a region without talking to all sides . 
  does any side want peace in that region ? 
   is the katyusha my communist uncle ~ ~ tortured ~ ~ `` tortured '' me with ftfy . 
  i really enjoy that song . 
  if you bought the tickets you can still come , 
   between refugees and past events i thought it was establshed that the perps were from north africa and not syria . 
  it 's a bit disingenious to lump everybody in the same pot . 
   i do n't care about who hijacked what i believe you need this commentary from george carlin https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muvdxxhlpa8&amp;t=42s, 
   for me it 's mindblowing its passed 12 years already . 
  almost other half of my life . . those countries joining is closer to cleopatra than the trex extinction is to the building of the pyramids . 
  or something like that . 
   anyway , i have my doubts about the 10 000 lives they saved . 
  eventual deaths from chernobyl are estimated at about 4000 , the vast majority of those people involved in the clean up . 
  yeah because they were contained . 
  duh  the fuel elements which they could take with them are a far bigger issue . 
  that 's what i mean , obviously . 
  another massive explosion would have been very very bad news . 
  dude you sound like those americans or whatever that are offended by zwarte piet . 
  omg black face ... so offensive . 
  the 1st of may existed before russia became communist in order to remember https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/haymarket_affair for a long time europe and america was a huge sweatshop . 
  ( now they 're in china ) the internationale is a french song https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_internationale the fact that the crazy commies hijacked all symbols related does n't make those symbols lose any value . 
  the hindus still have their swastika . 
   somehow dooming half the eurasian continent . 
  the undoubtedly saved tens od thousands of lives that 's for sure . 
  radioactive steam in the atmosphere ... 
  reminds me of the katyusha . 
  i imagine that 's the sound of hell . 
   most of them are not refugees , but economic migrants . 
  i forgot i 'm on / r/europe . 
  yeah dude . 
  isis took their jobs that 's why they 're economic immigrants . 
  sigh, 
  hon , hon , hon. 
  you fewlish allemand . 
  * twirls pencil moustache * . 
  i 'm not sure where the guy gets his `` yeah it was a pointless thing '' info from . 
  logically very hot radioactive stuff + water = radioactive steam . 
  not a good thing . 
   anonymous data heh . 
  you made me chuckle . 
  i think he 's saying he needs a miracle to get it up . 
   mass immigration of our youth and low birth rate of those that remain behind . 
  do n't forget the exodus of those working in the medical field . 
  we can finally have a war with germany on equal footing . 
  200 years we 've been waiting . 
  darn so what 's the problem ? 
  we just keep sending men to keep the peace in ukraine and fight the ruskies . 
  i 'm okay for financing that , not okay to send french soldiers die in a battle that can not be won, 
   sent some troops to the border i suggest sending cypriot troups . 
   despite it being popular to blame every problem on the us it is hard to do so in this case . 
  i love it how you casually forget to mention the whole iraq civil war between the shia and the sunni . 
  how isis was created by leaders of the ba'ath party that no longer had a place in al maliki 's iraq . 
  your guy al maliki that completely maginalised all sunnis . 
   you 're ignoring the eu 's pathetic enforcement where dat mission accomplished , democracy to iraq , wmds found and neutralised . 
  my oh my what a success story that was . 
  thanks dude . 
  do n't be afraid to get your head outta the sand from time to time man . 
   the fact refugees were simply allowed to walk in never being forced to register . 
  do the several million refugees roaming in the middle east suddenly disappear when you close the borders ? 
  do we tell them to go fuck themselves because the main issue is the 2 % for nato ? 
  a little less jingoism a little more realism man might help you a lot . 
   t 's not something new , it just shows the disdain the political elite has for the common people . 
  can you find me someone willing to have an honest intellectual debate on this issue ? 
  amongst french politicians ? 
   swap the treaty of versailles do people still blame versailles for hitler ? 
   the success of hitler was in a big part also the failure of the democratic politicians . 
  also the fact that he never got a majority , he rigged elections and he had his own private army . 
  but lets ignore that and go with the `` politicians not talking about immigrants caused hitler '' . 
   that 's nice . 
  you know what else is nice ? 
  the world police taking a huge crap on the middle east and distabilising the area therefore creating a huge amount of refugees . 
  how many refugees did the us take compared to europe ? 
   in fairness it is europe that russia likes to invade , not north america . 
  honest question , would 2 % actually solve anything ? 
  would it have prevented the ukraine invasion ?

  yeah , also the fact that those languages are closer to english than french is can help . 
  nope . 
  the word is in * italics * , which means that it 's a foreign word , not a french one . 
  he therefore follows the rules of its language , here english . 
  arabic is n't really a language . 
  i 'm not saying it 's a sub-language or some shit like that ; but classical arabic is spoken by few people , who tend to use local dialects/derivative of this language . 
  so , when you learn `` arabic '' , you have to pay attention to what you 're really learning . 
  hahahaha !, 
  look at this idiot !, 
  it 's ** french ** with a capital `` f '' , you moron !, 
  hahahaha !, 
  like this ? 
  he is definitely not a language nazi . 
  you should come to / r/france and try sprinkling a correct french sentence with english words . 
  you 'll get to see the actual language nazi then . 
  * well well bladiou-blada . 
  you forgot the ` stache , comrade !, 
  if you do n't understand the difference between talking and thinking , it says a lot about you . 
  you talk in your name , by using `` people '' . 
  okay , sure , whatever , just resume what you were doing . 
   almost destroyed this subreddit ahum . 
  i do n't think so . 
   these comments only make your side look like morons , making it hard for people to side with you . 
  please stop talking for other people . 
  talk in your name , that 's plenty enough thank you . 
  i do not wish for you to act as my spokesperson . 
   he was happy about being able to film everything . 
  no , he was in shock . 
  laughing is perfectly normal under those circumstances . 
   the person filming is partially laughing even . 
  this is a perfectly normal reaction after a shock . 
  this is neither poor taste nor ridiculous . 
  adrenaline does strange things to your brain . 
   and a chocolatine ooh , boy , what have you done ... 
  sounds legit . 
  i 'm readying my crossbow at the moment . 
  let 's see if those longbows still deserve their reputation . 
   and freedom of thought no . 
  that 's nonsense . 
  you 're not forbidden from thinking anything . 
  you may be forbidden from expressing something , but it has nothing to do with freedom of thought . 
   also , in holland there 's a saying : `` i 'd love fance except there 's french people there . '', 
  in france we say that about literally every region in the world . 
  well , except england of course . 
  there is literally no reason to ever love this god-forsaken piece of land . 
  `` except that no , the actual earliest reference to the bidet is in a french text , describing such an item in a parisian house on the 31 ^ st of december , 1709 . '', 
   and cream yeah , i ca n't stress that part enough . 
  * carbonara with cream * . 
  yummy !, 
  i do n't care if it 's true . 
  from this day on , i 'll only accept this explanation . 
  i knew what a joule is years before i learnt what a kwh is . 
  `` yeah , you , go back there !, 
  yeah , you 'll be killed , but i promise on the long run it 'll be better . 
  '' - . - and we could welcome them while working to fix the situation there , which will allow them to go back there in safer conditions . 
  telling them `` no , go back there , and fix it '' is senseless . 
  i 'll add that 1 gwh = 3,6 tj ( 10 ^ 12 joules ) , as a watt is 1 j.s ^ -1 , and an hour is 3,6.10 ^ 3 s. 
   which , in the long term , would be better for all involved . 
  especially for those leaving war zones and stuff . 
  they 'll feel right at home in a mass grave , i 'm sure . 
  i used `` academic french '' as `` correct french according to the academy '' here . 
  oh , my bad . 
  then yeah , you 're right , 
  it is true , entirely true . 
  but you 're comparing the language any ensglish-speaking person would speak with an acad\u00e9mie-endorsed french that basically no one speaks : / and that does n't make too much sense in my opinion . 
  yeah , but then you 're comparing two things that are n't equivalent : /, 
  the word was `` * courriel * '' ( `` ** courri ** er ** \u00e9l ** ectronique '' ) . 
  that a bad example :p the word is n't bad , easier imo to say than `` e-mail '' , and some ( few ) people actually use it . 
  but , yeah , sometimes it 's a taaad ridiculous . 
   from what i 've heard , french for example is much slower to adopt new words . 
  yes and no . 
  spoken , casual language does just exactly that . 
  but academic french does n't , and needs to be accepted/decide by the acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise . 
  ( i 'm talking about france 's french ; for the other french-speaking countries , i do n't know how it works ) . 
  as we all did , as we all did ... 
  and in french , someone slightly drunk ( tipsy ) is `` gris '' ( grey ) . 
  and there is more : `` so\u00fbl '' ( the formal word for `` drunk '' ) initially meant `` full '' ( generally of food , iirc ) , hence the expression `` tout son so\u00fbl '' , `` until fullness , satiation '' ( manger tout son so\u00fbl --  to fill up to your back teeth ) .

  you wan na talk about * mediterranean * weather ? 
  you ? 
  you do n't know what * mediterranean * really means . 
  you liked it , you chose it , you merely * adopted * it . 
  but it comes from the mediterranean see . 
  i was * born * in it , * molded * by it . 
  i could see mediterranean , i could smell mediterranean , i could eat mediterranean , i could * live * mediterranean since the day i was born . 
  a glance through my window would show me the mediterranean see , mother of all mediterranean climates . 
  can you say the same ? 
   some marseille weather do you mean [ this ] ( http://pastis.petanque.free.fr/images/pastis2.gif ) ? 
   the best climate ( mediterranean ) we may have a disagreement here buddy . 
   essentially you are guilty until you prove your innocence . 
  yeah , that 's what i was going to say : / thanks, 
   as it currently stands , it 's already illegal for britons to refuse to surrender their passwords or encryption keys just a question , maybe some people people will be able to answer me : would it be illegal to change your encryption key to one you do n't know ? 
  e.g. , i know they will take my hd , and i absolutely do n't wa n't them to read what 's inside . 
  so , i change the `` password '' , mash my keyboard on the notepad , copy-paste it ( to `` confirm '' it ) , then delete it from the notepad . 
  then i shut off my device . 
  what would happen ? 
  how * dare * you not to know something !,

  sure . 
  among other things : bits of history from neighboring countries , tons of trivia , how to effectively swear in spanish ( it 's mostly all about taking a dump on whatever the person holds dear ) . 
  i 'd go as far as saying it 's almost a \\* ~ ~ right ~ ~ of passage for high school students , taking to the streets against whatever school ( or not even school actually ) reform is being prepared , no ? 
  mine was during claude all\u00e8gre 's reform ( il faut d\u00e9graisser le mammouth ! ) . 
  i actually have good memories of it . 
  xd my boyfriend has the worst story . 
  i do n't recall what reform was at play when high schoolers went `` on strike '' that year but his dad was having none of it and drove the car in front of the high school , demanding they let him pass ( my boyfriend in the car , trying to make himself very small but it was a small town and everybody knew his dad ) . 
  part of me feels bad for him , the other just finds that story hilarious . 
  edit : ** talk about cultural freudian slip . 
  i , of course , meant `` rite of passage '' *, 
   estancos they 're called `` bureaux de tabac '' en france . 
  usually , you can buy newspapers , magazines , sometimes stationary in those shops as well . 
  they 're easily recognizable thanks to [ that sign ] ( https://static.actu.fr/uploads/2017/01/carotte-bureau-de-tabac-genay.jpg ) . 
  why did you capitalize universal ? 
  i sort of kind of ... 
  i actually really wish latin would become science 's international language again . 
  i * hate * reading about mathematics in english . 
  twice , each time for a whole afternoon !, 
  the first time i accompanied a friend who was visiting a college not too far from the canadian border ( not far from lake placid ) . 
  we spent the afternoon in a canadian border town ( i forgot the name ) . 
  i do n't know how they managed but most locals could tell i was french instantly . 
  the second time i was visiting a friend in buffalo so we made the obligatory niagara falls trip and went on the canadian side as well . 
  i forgot which side has the coolest view . 
  i 'd really like to go for more than one afternoon though . 
  especially the coastal regions . 
  got me there . 
  point being it frustrates her a lot to have to prove her germanness on such a regular basis :p, 
  german for 7 years ( starting at the beginning of junior high ) english for 5 years and a couple of years of latin . 
  in france ( in my time anyway , pretty sure it has n't changed ) when you enter junior high school ( coll\u00e8ge ) you have to chose a mandatory foreign language which will from then on be referred to as your `` premi\u00e8re langue '' ( first language ) . 
  the vast majority of people chose english as their first language however , where i come from being close to luxembourg and germany , it 's also not uncommon to have german as your first language ( which was my case ) . 
  two years later if you 're still in the general section you have to chose a second language ( or deuxi\u00e8me langue ) . 
  the choice varies a lot according to the region people come from , it 's amusing . 
  for instance , in my high school , very few people had taken spanish . 
  the reason being that almost no local coll\u00e8ges ( junior high school ) offered spanish class . 
  in my coll\u00e8ge you could chose between english , german and italian . 
  in most coll\u00e8ges you can find spanish though ... just not so much where i 'm from xd small town , eastern border , who gives a crap about spanish ... right ? 
  but then you 'll ask why italian and not spanish ? 
  good question . 
  well , lots and lots of italian immigrants came to my hometown making italy kind of our honorary culture if you will . 
  as for the quality of the teacher , my german teachers were generally good . 
  depressing sometimes but good . 
  the english teachers ... well , the quality varied more . 
  generally very little emphasis being made on being able to speak ( which is a problem when the final exam is an oral exam as is the case for the second language ) . 
  now that 's intriguing . 
  [ the french wiki article ] ( https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/barretina ) shows a photo with the caption `` groupe de rock catalan '' without giving the name of said group ( i 'm curious now ) . 
  also , mind blown , the smurfs wear catalan hats !, 
  now why would you wear a sock on your head ? 
  that makes no sense !, 
  ^ / s i 'll go google what that is this instant ... , 
  true dat . 
  a friend from bavaria keeps being asked where she 's from ( assuming not germany ) because she 's really tiny and has brownish hair . 
  she 's got to have the most german surname possible too . 
  she always makes a note of it , she finds it very annoying . 
  we had no choice but to take it when we subscribed . 
  we could send it back if we could find the damn thing . 
  it 's lost somewhere either in the basement or the black hole that is the hallway closet  _ < i really should look for it though . 
  it pisses me off to pay nagui 's salary very much ( or that of the cast of plus belle la life , or laurent ruquier ... well , you catch my drift ) . 
  if only i could be assured my money was only used for the radio ... or arte ... ( edit : yes , i realize nagui is on france inter ... or was , i lost track :p ), 
  actually now you do n't even have to own a tv to be eligible to pay that tax . 
  just having the tv box thing from your isp is enough to be eligible for the tax , with or without a tv . 
  got a letter from les imp\u00f4ts not too long ago telling me `` well hello there , we get it , you do n't have a tv but we went and check your internet subscription and your isp told us you got the tv box so ... hand over the tax monay please '' ( never even asked for the damned box in the first place . ), 
  tell me your secrets !, 
  i did n't even know what catalonia was then , so no i did n't and i knew valls was spanish , no clue where he was from ( nor did i particularly care to be honest ) . 
  i 've been doing some reading since then though ( on spain in general , not catalonia specifically ) . 
  i 'm a bit less ignorant now than i was then . 
  no , i did n't know them . 
  i 'm in the process of checking it out . 
  sounds interesting . 
  originally was planning to go to barcelona in december for a concert but ca n't clear my schedule ; so ... another time , 
  which literally meant nothing to me until like two months ago when i actually bothered to look up what the ` catalunya ' in [ `` la capella reial de catalunya '' ] ( https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/la_capella_reial_de_catalunya ) was for . 
  why did you assume i was judging them though ? 
  what they did bored me there 's nothing more to it than that . 
  spain . 
  i was 15 and went with a friend and her parents so i was n't in charge of anything and could just tag along . 
  worst vacation of my life . 
  her parents spent their days doing nothing either at the beach or at the pool in that horrible tourist houses neighborhood we were at . 
  i spent my days looking for some shelter from the heat and i remember i was reading firestarter by stephen king that summer . 
  how very appropriate , right ? 
  i 'm not too sure where we were , somewhere around benidorm if i recall correctly . 
  arg , and my friend was obsessed by the fact we could get more boys in spain than in france due to pale skin being rare over there or whatever ... 
  i just wanted to see a museum or a castle ffs . 
  [ jordi savall ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jordi_savall ) will never know how much he helped restore spain 's image for me xd, 
  some phrases with incorrect grammar became part of the common language . 
  [ like this one ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vromqtc7cgg ) which just throws sequence of tenses in the gutter but that pretty much everyone knows ( from the movie [ war of the buttons ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/war_of_the_buttons_ ( 1962_film \\ ) ) ) . 
  they can be enjoyable as long as you do n't expect them to be as good as the originals . 
  but the quality keeps going down with each book . 
  that 's why i took a `` break '' from the corrino and am reading something else for the moment . 
  there are some good moments and others that made me facepalm because it felt like i was reading some very dumbed down version of what it could have been had it been written by herbert . 
  i also got the sisterhood of dune a while back ( second hand book shops will be the death of me ) . 
  i 'll read it some day . 
  this winter i particularly liked coming home early , make myself some tea , put on eve online 's soundtrack and read the dune prequels . 
  that was perfection right there  i read dune ( all 5 books ) such a long time ago , it was really nice getting back in that universe ... even if it was n't as awesome as the original books . 
  the ones from god emperor of dune . 
  though i have to say , i 'm almost done reading the prequels ( about half of house corrino ) and duncan 's youth was very enjoyable to read . 
  i like kid duncan a lot too . 
  how about you ?

  if we leave it again it will remain . 
  all problems have their time and their amount of attention needed . 
  this matter does n't require constant attention by the state . 
  it 's not petty when another country contests your sovereignty over a region that belongs to you . 
  it happens very often with companies over trademarks , in a similar way anyway . 
  very constructive comment . 
  or by parties who want to use the un nomenclature . 
  your other points do stand thought . 
  now now , do n't try to discredit some by putting them in the nationalist bag . 
  the name the fyrom wants to adopt is as the wikipedia page s `` promoting the irredentist concept '' that the entirety of macedonia belongs to fyrom , which is not correct . 
  it is also a great geographical inaccuracy that was sparked by tito for propaganda reasons . 
  did it create a fuzz ? 
  there 's a fuzz on this subreddit , in greece there 's probably none . 
  and the fuzz has nothing to do with the fans , or very little , it merely sparked the whole naming issue once more . 
  or simply shrug it off . 
  what matters for you may not be the same as others , therefore in my opinion one should refrain from jumping to such conclusions . 
  i still think it would imply the whole region . 
  it also leaves the door open for contestation in later times . 
  they kicked their asses until one point where guerrilla tactics could n't work anymore . 
  i do n't think an attack from the byzantine army would be countered easily , especially considering they had n't cities . 
  in any case they were assimilated and christianised , whether or not you or i like it . 
  it would indeed be more accurate perhaps , but in historical terms fyrom holds a minor part of macedonia , while greece hold a majority , which would be highlighted in spain owning a very small part of the historical region of portalegre as you call it . 
  and perhaps so also in modern terms : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:macedonia_overview.svg calculations must be doen though , if relevant . 
  probably because these city was founded by athenians , perhaps ? 
  there 's also paris in ... texas ? 
  there 's also albany , there 's alexandria and so on and so forth . 
  these never mattered . 
  perhaps but i do n't see where the problem is , historically you were part of the polish commonwealth ( did i get it right ? ), 
  and now not , end of the line . 
  fyrom has no relation apart from sharing the region of macedonia with greece ( and also bulgaria and albania ) , taking the name macedonia is like appropriating the entirety of the region , which by the way is in its majority ( the historical one ) in greece . 
  we call them the french and belgian ardennes , but not the country belgium ardennes . 
  if they wanted to change , belgian ardennes would be accepted while bare ardennes would n't be . 
  if you did then you 'd have a problem with the un ... mkd/macedonia is not recognised by the un . 
  the us does , but greece does n't and nor do the rest of western europe . 
  besides , you have no right to blank their name , they came before you , that would be actual revisionism . 
  edit : i also am not trying to twist the subject , you gave the example of the state and the country which have no relation , economical , cultural , historical or geographical , which greece and the fyrom do . 
  you know , that 's what the greek government said around the times of the ww2 when tito said his country will be called macedonia . 
  turns out it comes back to bit you in the ass 60-70 years later , therefore it 's now or never . 
  the slavs of the region were assimilated into the byzantine empire , not vice versa . 
  no it does n't make sense because the country is not the region , it is part of the region . 
  northern macedonia is very accurate and does n't bring problems . 
  well prepaying taxes is not a bad concept if it is as you say it is , but from my experience and communication with a lot of people it did not sound as so , rather than a nice name to increase the tax . 
  northern republic of macedonia was also proposed if i recall well . 
  because macedonia is a region that is shared between greece and the fyrom . 
  claiming `` macedonia '' is like claiming the whole region . 
  claiming `` northern macedonia '' does n't , it 's fair . 
  if austria/germany/slovakia got to call itself bohemia how would you react ? 
  imagine spain calling itself kingdom of spain and portugal . 
  that implies that portugal is part of spain . 
  let 's see how you like it . 
  because you are more or less of the same family ( of languages ) . 
  fyrom usurps a name to make it its own in its entirety . 
  greece has accepted northern macedonia if i recall well , but macedonia on its own is simply not right geographically or historically . 
  edit : added `` of languages '' because apparently the previous wording was not well seen . 
   we allow the country georgia to exist you fucking what mate ? 
  you * allow the country to exist * , oh my how benevolent !, 
  now , what you may do has nothing to do with what greece does because you are not greece . 
  you `` were '' for some years and look how it turned out ... georgia as a state is the one that should be made to change , if there is any reason for it , which there may not be since the origins of the names may be different . 
  also there is no relation between either , to the contrary with greece and the fyrom . 
  they are not throwing a tantrum , they silently oppose it , by blanking out the name which by their definition is wrong , and by un standards is also non existent . 
  edit : i will be childish now and mention that in that match , fyrom supporters/fans had flags and panels with writings that were specifically made to provoke the greeks , which was uncalled for . 
  they do have something to d with macedonia , a part of their country is in the north of the region of macedonia , but that does not warrant them getting the name , especially since there are alternatives that are both accurate and not offensive for anybody . 
  greece was never called like that before and former turkish republic of greece can be offensive . 
  fyrom was never called macedonia before except by tito , for propagandistic reasons , and is by default the name used because macedonia simply can not be accepted . 
  northern macedonia or other variants would , because it is an accurate term . 
  this is your opinion , which you are of course entitled to . 
  however the name mkd ( i think that was what they used ) has no validity . 
  it simply does not exist for a country , it 's not recognized by the eu or the un . 
  fyrom on the contrary is recognised . 
  imagine that mexico would call itself california , or canada calling itself washington or utah or anything . 
  if they want a name with macedonia in it , call them northern macedonia , or northern republic of macedonia , or slavo - macedonia , whatever , but macedonia is simply not it . 
  belgium is not called the ardennes and it would never be accepted . 
   yes , but that only matters in the first year . 
  then you pay 50 + 50 . 
  i somehow doubt this , from my dealings with those affected ( free professionals to translate it crudely ) as for fiscal receipts , there are little block notes that make an imprint on a secondary piece of paper , however these are perfectly valid and have almost as much weight as a printed receipt , because they are numbered and go to the `` economist '' of the company/office/business . 
  what happens afterwards has less to do with the fiscality and rather with the people dealing with it . 
  as for the device , seems pretty neat but i 've only seen the traditional `` receipt machines '' , never such one as this . 
  i think that 500 billions in arms deals would tend to be more of a factor . 
  or perhaps the billions of money not paid by big companies circumventing regulations . 
  or maybe the care of the hundred of thousands of immigrants for the past decade . 
  also regular wastes which occur in other countries too , big infrastructure works that were not necessarily needed or costed too much . 
  besides , half of the money owed were caused by the bank bailouts , in all the fault to put on the state or the people decreases quite a bit . 
  there 's also the big state companies that had ludicrous pays for fictive employments but they are mostly gone since 2013 , so it does n't fit if we talk only about current expenditures . 
  the lost vat is of course a factor but compared to the other factors it remains rather shy . 
  every year you pay your taxes , 100 % , but also 50 % of the next year as a prepayment . 
  in total you get to pay 150 % taxes , and as somebody else said in these comments , they are 200 % today . 
   also , i 'm in greece now and i was wondering how can you tell if it 's a fiscal receipt or not ? 
  what do you mean by fiscal receipt ? 
  i don ' tudnerstand your question basicaly . 
  how come zaman runs such an article ? 
  i would n't have expected from them to be pro-greece on something . 
  i would n't say a tourist trap but it does n't have a lot apart from the shops , you cover it in an hour if i recall well . 
   almost all of greek transactions are cash based and that money is n't being taxed . 
  that is a blatant lie . 
  some are not taxed but by no means are they almost all . 
  i do n't see how it is stupid , the name is the recognized by either the un ( or nato ? ), 
  and nor by the greek state , the channel merely protests against that . 
  nothing to do with censorship , everybody know what it is and why . 
  yeah , it 's pretty idiotic and unsustainable . 
  you mean that they raised the initial 150 % to 200 or decrease it to 100 % ?

  i support ( to a certain degree ) this post . 
   and one of the largest industrial sectors . 
  at the end of wwi their economy was in shambles . 
  the nazis built that industry from scratch , to feed the war machine . 
   well , then i suggest them stopping to use services they can not pay for . 
  ah yes . 
  i 'm sure the country will stop having electric power , heating and running water . 
  that would never go wrong . 
  there totally would n't be a revolution within the week / s  there is some talk , though , about sending some tax enforcing officers to help the greeks setting up a stick themselves . 
  i suspect you confuse 2 very different things : - they have public & private debts , and they can only pay those very slowly , not at current rates . 
  - people also have to pay taxes ( the usual ones i 'm talking . 
  those that exist in every countries and are perfectly normal ) . 
  now there is a * giant * tax fraud issue ; especially from some very very wealthy individual and companies . 
  everyone fraud those ; it 's cultural . 
  now if germany help greece collecting the second , that would probably mean like +10 to 20b ( well i 'd say a lot more but you would n't believe me on the numbers ) per year , which means they could 1 \u00b0 ) run better their own country ( more cash in the budget ) 2 \u00b0 ) while still paying more money back 3 \u00b0 ) without additionnal strain on the system 4 \u00b0 ) and the less corruption the better . 
  i 'd also support it , because while i support dropping part of the tax debts on the poorest ( < 1500 $ / mo ; because that money do n't exist ) ; quite frankly if you are a shipping operator and have 2 ' 000 ' 000 ' 000 $ stashed abroad on accounts and claim you do n't have to pay taxes , honestly fuck you . 
  and there is a lot of money to make there . 
   it would be a very , very short war , with horrific consequences for greece . 
  most likely . 
  then you 'd still have banditism issues in every single neighbor , people dying left & right , and basically a right wing north korea in the middle of the continent . 
  oh and instead of trying to get them to open more we want to cease every single last buck they have . 
  am i the only one here thinking this is a bad idea ? 
   and the kim family setting the `` right '' priorities . 
  yeah , it 's called a military first policy . 
  and it 's not just happening in shitholes like nk . 
  every pressed country does it . 
  just look at ukraine , country i like a lot with leaders that i think are currently trying to turn their country around . 
  neither did officially disarmed germany post wwi , which was giving like yearly 20 % of their gdp as reparations . 
  yet in the space of 10 years ... 
   toll roads and higher utility costs . 
  they cant pay utilities costs anymore . 
  some people are making do on 300 $ / mo. 
  i suggest you watch what 's going on in armenia very carefully : http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jun/24/armenia-yerevan-protests-electric-prices-russia  by making people pay their debts ? 
  if they had the money to pay those back , they would n't have debts now would n't they ? 
  sending an enforcer to beat them bloody wo n't make the money magically appear . 
   actually , i was talking about international opposition of greece when it comes to macedonia 's real name . 
  oh , ah ok , makes more sense haha . 
   so you think there might be a grecocypriot war . 
  yeah the gd would actually be stupid enough to try invading north cryprus i 'm afraid . 
   yeah ... you are aware war costs money , and that 's kinda the problem with greece these days ? 
  yes and russia is kinda facing the same problem yet it sadly does not prevent them from walking guns and tanks to the front . 
  and even the bloody starving-to-death north korea have enough weapons to harass sk . 
  not against . 
  the greek gov of that time was corrupt and was helped by us corps to cook their books to hide their debts . 
  it allowed the us corps & markets to loan them more money than `` legally possible '' ; and in return make money on the interests of said new debts & other various advantages ( contracts , kickbacks , etc ) . 
  now that gov was tossed out , but it 's way too late and the damages have already been done over decades . 
  banks & organisms like standard & poor 's , morgan stanley , jp morgan chase & various others have a huge part of responsability in that one , imho . 
  it 's not the us as a state or a cia plot or something , it 's the consequences of insane corporate fraud helped by us megacorps that is now destroying a country down the line . 
  victim of a huge economic crisis crippling and killing their country after book cooking ( partly sponsored by eu/us economic systems ) . 
   like infrastructure and what do you intend to do with it ? 
  bulldozer the entire country ? 
  declare every single citizen 's home a foreign asset and make 30 % of the population homeless because their mortgaged house was ceased ? 
  you understand this is exactly how you start a war in europe ? 
  you are german . 
  i 'd thought your own history would teach you better . 
   , long-standing international disputes ( fryom , anyone ? ), 
  you want to annexate part of greece ? 
  holy shit man , do you even hear yourself talking ? 
   yeah , as if those guys would be able to do anything differently . 
  they 'll take their stashed weapons , and go start looting around their own country like the russian `` separatists '' do in eastern ukraine right now . 
  this is what they 'll do . 
   cyprus is a sovereign nation so was ukraine . 
  i do n't think the gd nazi gives a shit about that . 
  y' know state do that when that save tens of thousands of employees jobs , sometime . 
  and we 're talking about an entire country here , and only part of the debt . 
   instead of liquidating the deadbeater ? 
  what are you suggesting by `` liquidating the deadbeater '' ? 
  zeroying the entire country bank accounts and watch them actually go full nazi ~ ~ next election ~ ~ after a hunger revolution ? 
  how about when the golden dawn start attacking turkey to loot money , esp in cyprus ? 
   what exactly are they waiting on ? 
  the signature of the agreement being currently negociated ? 
  ( expected within days if lucky ? ), 
   what people are saying is that greece 's problems are of it 's own making so , say you 're a medical crew when you have a dying patient who is partly to blame you just leave him to die in the streets because #no #responsability ? 
   as the head of government syriza needs to take responsibility and set a course for setting things to rights . 
  there 's that little problem that most of it is out of their hands and in troika hands right now , since the troika has all the money . 
  i 'm sure they 'd love to move forward but until there 's an agreement , the other options are all just even worse . 
   sorry guys , you 've promised more to your voters than you can do . 
  it 's not a `` humiliation of the nation '' , it 's you being dumb . 
  victim blamming , much ? 
  i fail to see how syriza is/was responsible for greece 's situation , sorry  as a side note , governments and international institutions care about money , but not about your pride . 
  the sooner you understand this , the better your negotiations will be . 
  and if the country blows up in social unrest they wo n't have much of those , money , wo n't they ? 
  horrible . 
  and in my own backyard . 
  i heard they already found the culprits ? 
  edit : relevant live in french : http://www.lefigaro.fr/actualite-france/2015/06/26/01016-20150626livwww00104-direct-attentat-isere.php  c'est un pompier du sdis 38 qui aurait permis l'arrestation du suspect interpell\u00e9 et identifi\u00e9 , a rapport\u00e9 bfm tv , citant le pr\u00e9fet de l'is\u00e8re . 
  somebody desserves a medal there, 
  this is idiotic . 
  banning progress wo n't help . 
  if the gov really wants to help taxis it could lower the licence cost which is ridiculously high ( http://www.taxis-de-france.com/abonnes/text.php?id=prixdeslicences tens of thousands of euros ? ), 
  and/or refund part of it slowly over time to those who already passed it , for example as a slight tax discount . 
  and if the taxis still ca n't offer a competitive offer , maybe their service is just shit next to uber y' know and that 's why few people wants to deal with them ? 
  ( and of course the taxis would rather have absolute monopole enforced by law and be allowed to arrest/jail any concurrents they dislike , but maybe things should n't run like this ? ), 
  then maybe they should had some motivation for mandatory attendance ; like part of any benefits being only granted if they show up at least some degree of it . 
  or a tax rate difference . 
  edit : definitely interesting : https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3b4kdt/four_of_ten_refugees_fail_danish_language_test/csit1sx, 
  i believe a thank you is in order for the concessions towards greece . 
  i 'd still complain a bit tho about the fired military headcount ( i hope athens will offer them an alternative position ; keep them in sight because in case of heavy social unrest it 'll make a huge difference whether the ones who know how to hold the weapons had a paycheck or not . ), 
   increase the rate of the tonnage tax and phase out special tax treatments of the shipping industry . 
  very good idea actually ( sorry , it 's needed .

  right-leaning , pro-austerity people will tell you that the fault is shared between him and montebourg : hollande has n't taken the budgetary measures far enough for them to show results , while montebourg lacks economic sense and makes everyone 's lives shit by publicly agitating against his boss 's economic policies . 
  as for the mandates , basically the president is elected and nominates the pm , and can `` accept his resignation '' ( = fire him ) almost at will . 
  although it 's only happened when there was a real case for it . 
  it has become unfortunately common these past few years , starting with jacques chirac 's second presidency ( 2002-2007 ) to have government `` reshuffles '' where , after a political setback , the government shows their willingness to be serious from now on by having the pm resign and be re-nominated almost instantly ( that 's not exactly how it happens , but hey ) . 
  the government is then formally dismissed and re-formed , either with differences or with almost the same ministers save one or two public sacrifices/promotions/whatever . 
  can , should n't . 
  [ artist 's impression ] ( http://mythsandhitches.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/photo.jpg ), 
  actually it 's pretty much the same frequency . 
  only difference is in france , the pm serves as a fall guy to take the blame on everything and we do n't need to re-elect anybody when it happens . 
  the 2010s will be the worldwide decade of political trolling . 
  i am very disappointed that this is not a thing . 
  i do n't want to know which is which ... 
  i do n't want to defend the bankers and traders , but classical keynesianism was pretty clear on the `` constrain spending when the going gets better '' , which very few european countries , and certainly not france , have done in the past 40 years . 
  i mean , runaway finance caused the crisis , but one of the reasons the french economy was fragile in the first place is the previous generations of politicians thinking * `` on the one hand , sound economics says i should reduce public spending ... on the other hand , people vote for me if i give them free money !, 
  why am i even debating this ? 
   ( ... ) the problem is that there are n't enough lucrative investment targets ( ... ) i agree on the regulation angle . 
  coming from france , and having studied in finland , i 've seen the effect it has . 
  however i do n't think just de-regulating the market ( you give the example of smes , which is spot on ) will suffice . 
  a lot of industries depend on public-sector contracts and , at least in france , a lot of things could be renovatd ( schools , hospitals , that sort of thing ) . 
   that is more or less impossible . 
  i wo n't even pretend i know * how * it could be implemented , i just think it 's necessary to avoid , like the metaphor went in the '80s , `` fueling japan 's recovery with our public money '' ( gross oversimplification , i know , but still ) . 
  it 's probably impossible indeed , but i do n't know . 
   this never happens . 
  agreed 100 % , that 's why i do n't trust them to do it this time . 
  as a frenchman and a former socialist , i really do n't know how to feel about this . 
  i think the best course of action is 1 ) use public spending to boost national production and consumption , like the new deal did . 
  2 ) find ways to make sure national production is prioritized to avoid channeling the public spending into imports , as it happened in 1980 's france , because that defeats the point . 
  3 ) tighten your budget like fuck once the situation gets better and return to responsible public spending . 
  i 'm pretty sure `` austerity measures '' ( although whether france has implemented true austerity is a point of debate ) will fail to bring growth , but let 's be honest for a minute : successive french governments were proudly irresponsible with their finances during the best of times , does anyone really believe they will be responsible once we 're out of this mess ? 
  i certainly do n't trust them to . 
  i 'm sure in their minds , that would be surrendering to * `` les anglo-saxons '' * and cost them precious votes . 
  on top of that , france has structural problems beyond public spending that nobody wants to touch , and that some thinkers are slowly egding towards maybe suggesting that potentially reforms could be not-horrible ( which is an unbelievable change from 10 years ago ) . 
  i 'm not sure that if we move away from austerity-mandated reforms we 'll ever touch these structural issues . 
  i ** really ** do n't know how to feel about this . 
  so wait , the story was actually made up by foreign media ? 
  man ... we had a similar case a few years back , but it turned out the alleged victim had made it up for attention , not actual journalists looking for a story ... 
  shit , i 'm screwed . 
  in sicily ... 
  does that include the cost of `` protection '' ? 
  i 'd say as french first , as parisian second , as european third . 
  then everything else in a disorganised jumble . 
  the cash itself is petty change for a saudi prince , i think ( well , not exactly petty cash , but not something they 'd be too distraught over ) . 
  the documents are the worrying thing . 
  they 're said to be `` sensitive '' by the embassy , which can mean anything . 
  i do n't expect an embassy convoy to carry the shutdown codes for the saudi oil-production grid or anything like that - well , i hope not - but the thieves may be looking to exploit them . 
  or , you know , maybe it 's just the john le carr\u00e9 fan in me spazzing out . 
  europa universalis 4 tells me it 's the coat of arms of ukraine . 
  i 'm not sure what the emblem is supposed to represent though . 
  well , there goes their chance of joining the eu .

  my apologies for the misrepresentation . 
  i was n't sure until the end that they would include corsica . 
  corsica is a bit of a strange case ; it 's the one in the list ( that i know of ) where the national political establishment is against independence , but the wider population absolutely is . 
  there 's incredible amounts of money poured into the region , dead policemen and civilians over the past twenty years , basically more trouble than it 's worth . 
  i am also surprised at the inclusion of brittany - breton culture is strong and enjoys a lot of popularity in wider france , but political independence has been off the map for decades - as i recall , the breton separatists killed some people in the 70s , which do shocked the breton people that they turned against independence . 
  this is the shelling of the night !,

  the sad thing is , this is true . 
  in france at least , opinions are fluid , self adjusting to whatever disagrees more with current american policy . 
   and a strong jewish diaspora is the best argument against zionism pretty much . 
  a cousin of mine and his family is jewish ( through marriage and conversion , but that 's something else ) and they 're serious , orthodox and highly rabbinical jews , as well as highly zionist . 
  they do n't feel safe here , and i give them about two years before they pack up and become israeli .

  probably something involving stoning . 
  just a hunch ... 
  i 'm not sure how sykes-picot related to the arab israeli conflict ? 
  although i agree it had effects on the rest of the region . 
  also , my last point was made more emotionally than logically . 
  i 'm aware the west played a hand in the creation of israel as a state . 
  still , the west did n't force the arab states to declare war on israel in 1948 , nor did they force the israeli government to occupy the west bank `` because yhwh said so '' . 
  yes , we 're at the inception of it all , but they had countless shots to fix it and they refused . 
  plus , the one guy who had a good chance got assassinated . 
  it 's going to be really hard not to reach the godwin point here . 
  in vichy france , public parks had `` no entry for dogs and jews '' signs on their gates . 
  this guy is not a state , just a random scumfucker , but he 's managed to do worse .

  i had to do a double-take on your first two . 
  what the hell o_o, 
  i guessed that you were still studying french , since you used `` depuis '' ; if it 's indeed the case , you ca n't use pass\u00e9 compos\u00e9 here because it 's for past actions , and only actions which have been `` finished '' . 
  there are some tricky occurences , but it 's mostly that : * `` j'ai \u00e9tudi\u00e9 le fran\u00e7ais pendant deux ans '' ( i 've studied french for two years ) =  you 're not studying french anymore , but you did for two years at a point in the past =  pass\u00e9 compos\u00e9 * `` j'\u00e9tudie le fran\u00e7ais depuis deux ans '' ( i 've been studying french for two years ) =  you 're studying french now =  pr\u00e9sent it may also be used like this : * `` j'ai toujours aim\u00e9 le chocolat '' ( i 've always loved chocolate ) =  the action is not finished per se , because , for all we know , you 're still going to love chocolate tomorrow , but pass\u00e9 compos\u00e9 is used here because the action is framed in a finished timespace ( `` always '' ( before ) to `` now '' ) . 
  * `` longtemps , j' ai aim\u00e9 l'odeur du pain frais '' ( i loved the smell of fresh bread for a long time ) =  you loved the smell for a long time of your life =  finished timespace . 
  i hope it helps . 
  if i may help you : `` qu'il est une jolie langue '' would actually be `` que c'est [ une jolie langue ] '' . 
  damn , it 's actually pretty hard to explain . 
  basically , when to choose * ce * / * c ' * or * il/elle * : * * il/elle * refer to a specific person/it 's direct . 
  * * c/ce * do n't / it 's indirect . 
  ( it 's unbelievable !, 
  ) ; `` ce sont de jolies chaussures '' ( these are pretty shoes ) . 
  it can be very tricky . 
  i hope i 've remembered well !, 
  and beware , pass\u00e9 compos\u00e9 hijacked your first verb !, 
  when i see the assembly ( france ) , i sometimes want to kick them in the back of the head ; when they `` boooo '' the person currently talking ( almost always someone of another party , of course ) , for example . 
  i really find this kind of behavior childish , and unbecoming of an elected official . 
  merci beaucoup !, 
  france ( currently ) : * unemployment , financial/social issues , economy * baccalaur\u00e9at ( end of high school exam , always a big deal ) * political scandals : cahuzac , sarkozy , gu\u00e9ant , lagarde , i 'm sure i 've forgotten some ... it seems justice has kicked it up a notch since a year ago ( it 's nice ! ), 
  * people stabbing each other in the back : barroso for the country , ump boys and girls for sarkozy , eelv ( greens ) for the socialist party * law about `` the moralization of public life '' in the assembly ( officials , their assets , etc. ), 
  * international politics : g8 , turkey , we 're starting to hear about brazil too . 
  yup , lot of stabbing these days . 
  as for the rest -- there have been very polarizing issues and rhetoric used these last few years ( during the gay marriage thing , for example ) , so i think shouting and losing friends could , sadly , happen these days . 
  so it 's gotten to the point where you make memes of dead children . 
  what the fuck is wrong with you ? 
  no , they still are firmly far right , even if they try to present themselves better to be more palatable .

  a bit , yeah . 
  maybe i 'm not hanging out in the right places !, 
  : o not everyday you see a reference to snatch . 
   the previous version of the article , which has since been edited , said that the man was one of the gens du voyage . 
  yes , it must have been a previous version -- i saw two of them myself while i translated it . 
  i was surprised because nowhere in these two versions did they say anything about the shooter being roma . 
  well , we 'll see soon enough anyway . 
   shooting between a roma man and two policemen ( gendarmes ) , with a roma woman and child among the wounded nowhere in the article does it say that the shooter was roma .

  the islamophobic message was thinly veiled . 
  but i 've noticed that in pharmacies there are some diff\u00e9rences . 
  when the pharmacy is in front of a kindergarden , or just a family-friendly area , condoms are more likely to be behind the counter . 
  in my university , they were showcased . 
  yes they are . 
  i think they are accurate and neutral in their reporting but their opinion pieces are center-left . 
  it 's still one of the newspaper which keeps a good separation between the two . 
  and arte is arguably the best tv channel on french television . 
  sometimes , they are a little bit too weird or artsy . 
  but they always avoid sensational crap for interesting content . 
  they have great documentaries and news shows . 
  and i will never thank arte enough for introducing me to miyazaki 's movies . 
  i was n't sure germans were aware of that . 
  i know it 's very impressive in czechia too . 
  the sudetenland is the least pleasing part of the country because of the landfills and the houses abandonned by the germans in the 40 's . 
  was the us more equal at the time ? 
  i know that we were in continental europe but i thought that it was because had there properties destroyed/stolen during wwii . 
  i do n't know if they loved him . 
  but my family is still mocking him for being such an alcoholic . 
  i think you have to keep in mind the left of this is graph is most of the mainstream media . 
  the rest is regional or tabloid . 
  but i love that we have a public option just like in the uk . 
  it prevents a race to the bottom in my opinion . 
  not as much as before . 
  your entries are so good !, 
  that 's so cool !, 
  fyi , there are junkyards all around germany . 
  it 's apparently because germans used to throw their garbage there to avoid paying a garbage fee . 
  i think i understand the criticism but i do n't understand how trade barrier is anything but maintaining a status quo . 
  i do n't understand how sovereignists can oppose separatist movements as well . 
  every countries have several regions with different economical and political interests . 
  east germany and west germany have very different economical backgrounds . 
  but in the case of france i find that particularly hypocritical . 
  sure there is the normal diversity in the metropole . 
  auvergne is heavily subsidized by the eu . 
  paris is integrated in the global economy . 
  the north is losing its industry to foreign competition . 
  the south is worried about refugees . 
  and the central national government have to balance the interest of everyone even if everyone wished to dictate its interests to other regions . 
  but then someone argues the metropole share more interests with french polynesia than with germany and i laugh . 
  and m\u00e9lenchon is a great fan of oversea territories , but he speaks of them as dependencies in my opinion . 
  there is a true debate to have about balancing the interests of all the regions in a single entity . 
  and this balance is better achieved through a union which acts as an arbitrator . 
  in your example , there are many solutions that can be implemented by the eu imo . 
  subsidies for local produce , harmonize regulations between the french and polish labour markets , aid to help the transition of french farming . 
  those are probably mediocre ideas , i 'm not a policy maker . 
  but i do believe it is the eu that should ease this conflict . 
  the alternative , protectionnism , appears to be rooted in xenophobia in my opinion . 
  the french deserve more than the polish to be protected and make a profit . 
  it 's a consistent view of the world , but one that appears very wrong to me . 
  so i understand where le pen is coming from when she wants to leave the eu . 
  but i see no valid circumstances under which m\u00e9lenchon can argue for sovereignty . 
  if they rule , they will need to form a coalition with the republicans . 
  the party base of the coalition would be much larger and closer to the center . 
  i 'm still worried though . 
  i think he is talking about unity . 
  even in dead horse , alaska , you care and you know what happens in d.c. , new york and los angeles . 
  the us is as important as the eu as a whole or china . 
  but europe remains very much foreign to each other even if we share many values . 
  no one in france reads about what is happening in poland . 
  few know what is happening in brussels . 
  we still lack a common destiny feeling . 
  without that , it is difficult to have credible strong international leadership . 
  that 's , like , your opinion man . 
  and you should really look it up . 
  for example , women should have the right to be sterilized without the authorization of their husband . 
  this right is not protected in the us . 
  i understand and i am apparently downvoted because i believe that turkey is closer to alabama than saudi arabia in that regard . 
  women faces more challenges in turkey than in most of the west . 
  but turkish feminists are fighting against patriarchal culture just like the rest of first world feminist ( some are more legitimate than others , sure ) . 
  turkish feminists are not fighting for the right to drive like in saudi arabia or the right to go to school like in afghanistan . 
  usually , when people disregard third-wave feminism , they point to iran as an example . 
  so when someone says the same tired talking point about turkey , i assume he is comparing turkey to the rest of the muslim world . 
  so i repeat myself , the fight of turkish women for equality in unpaid work and sexual liberation is closer to the campaigns in spain and poland than qatar . 
  even if the threat to their rights from erdogan is greater than anywhere else in the west . 
  it 's not simply what he says . 
  we can look at his record . 
  the republicans can say they offer `` better '' care , but then we can look and see they lie . 
  macron does n't seem to have been inconsistent so far . 
  we kind of did it before when greenland left the eu . 
  denmark became the successor state , but it was already most of the previous state so it 's slightly different . 
  free-trade within the eu area is inscribed in the treaties just as free-trade within france is inscribed in the constitution . 
  it 's just an issue of equality and unique rule for all europe . 
  being against free-trade within europe but for free-trade within france is just europhobia and sovereignism . 
  you can not run for a regional council on a platform of bringing trade barriers to protect your region 's economy without being called a separatist . 
  i believe m\u00e9lenchon 's rhetoric is just sugar-coated euroskepticism . 
  he agrees with the political union and some degree of harmonization . 
  but he wants the death of the economical union that he perceives benefits more to the elite . 
  i might consider vote for hamon , but i sure wo n't vote for his party in the legislatives . 
  it 's an actually exciting election to go through because we have an unusual diversity of serious candidates and no one knows for certain the outcome . 
  he does n't want a more democratic eu because he does n't respect the eu democratically choosing to be liberal . 
  instead it want to pressure the eu by using the threat of french sovereignty . 
  this is typical of the far-left refusing to compromise . 
  m\u00e9lenchon is someone extremely intelligent and i have a lot of respect for him . 
  but he despises * politics * , ie . 
  negociating , compromising and listening to the majority . 
  which are better correlated to poverty rates than religion . 
  but we can continue to criticize them and pressure them to be less biased anyway . 
  they are always * accurate * . 
  honesty is yet to be proven .

what i am talking about is that this vote will allow other countries to think not only about internal immigration within europe but also their external borders . 
  for years it was almost taboo to even consider or talk about the fact that outside immigration in europe has been more costly than it has been saving . 
  norway , sweden , france , belgium , swizerland , england and germany are all facing these issue with external immigration problems . 
  i do . 
  i think though , rather i hope that its a sign that open borders and lax immigration policies are on their way out for the rest of europe because of the reasons i explained above . 
  i 'm glad they are trying to push for this . 
  hopefully this will also push the rest of the european countries ( not necessarily in the eu ) to pass similar restrictions on immigration as many countries are already overburdened by the number of immigrants coming from africa , especially in relation to increases in crime , and costs to take in these immigrants . 
  france , and england have huge problems with respect to immigrants and the time is now to reverse these trends . 
  europe has no obligation to take these people in , especially when they do n't want to assimilate or integrate into european society . 
  this is what ends up happening : http://i.imgur.com/ktp2gth.png, 
  marine le pen said this about a few months ago . 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqyhj8fx2rq still rings very true to the immigration issues and calls for using the same policy that australia uses . 
  yep ... only the daily mail has this information ... http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/immigration/10417222/illegal-immigrants-cost-taxpayer-more-than-4000-a-head-each-year.html http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/immigration/11209234/immigration-from-outside-europe-cost-120-billion.html http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/jan/10/non-eu-immigration-unemployment http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/european-immigrants-contribute-5bn-to-uk-economy-but-noneu-migrants-cost-118bn-9840170.html http://news.sky.com/story/1366933/eu-migrants-pay-in-more-than-they-take-study, 
  well if well to do americans and other western folks get deported from the uk and hate preachers , literal terrorists , and benefit leaches get to stay , not much you can really do . 
  uk policies are backwards as fuck and they seem to care very little out ethnic brits . 
  what this says is that inter european immigration is good , which i think is an ok positive outcome . 
  outside of europe , per the article , it costs a whole lot more than what they get in taxes . 
  if you got rid of all the immigration from outside of europe , you effectively cut costs by billions of pounds per year . 
  this is a symptom of a larger problem . 
  these immigrants want to go to the uk because of the insane benefits program that is offered . 
  easiest way to reduce this mess is to slash the benefits and stop handing it out like free candy . 
  in a nation with a ever increasing debt-to-gdp ratio , you 'd think they would , i dunno , start getting rid of programs that are costing literally billions of pounds with no return on investment . 
  immigrants from outside of the uk cost the taxpayer billions and do not contribute in returns in taxes nearly as much as the benefits they sap . 
  seems like all you can do is apply labels to people as some sort of argument or excuse . 
  i 'm not sure you could even hold a conversation . 
  my bad . 
   misanthropic that 's a big word for you to use , shame you have no clue how to use it . 
  i love europeans and european culture . 
  i highly dislike islam and cultures originating from africa as they are extremely toxic and incapable of sustaining liberty and fraternity . 
  i would also suggest that you do not reply to someone if the only thing you can do is bring up their previous comments . 
  it shows how little you can actually sustain a conversation . 
  bravo !, 
  you should read closely . 
  i stipulated immigration from outside of europe is a net-loss on the economy which is true . 
  studies have shown however immigrants from within europe , aka from other european countries provide a net benefit . 
  https://www.ucl.ac.uk/news/news-articles/1114/051114-economic-impact-eu-immigration vs outside of europe . 
  http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/immigration/11209234/immigration-from-outside-europe-cost-120-billion.html i bet you that german study does not differentiate between the two for this very reason . 
  i 'd like to see a differentiated study from germany that would show the same result . 
   how is this to be accomplished ? 
  it simply is not an easy solution . 
  you come up with `` answers '' that are not really answers . 
  yours answers are on the same level as `` i 'd like to solve world hunger '' yes that 's fine , but how ? 
  you do not answer the how and while we can not answer that the only possibility is immigration , otherwise our pension system will break apart and with that our society . 
  obviously it 's not a simple solution . 
  you first have to figure out why are families not producing as many children and find the root cause and attempt a solution from that angle . 
  a variety of reasons could very well include work , not enough financial support , breakdown of the family structure , cultural , etc. 
  that is what the damn government is for , spend money to study and analyze the problem and solve it . 
  immigration is n't the be all end all solution . 
  i appreciate your counter arguments but you seem to take away a point i make and run wildly with it . 
  nowhere do i state that we should invade muslim countries and implement silly child policies . 
  what i would like to see is a closing of the floodgates and try to assimilate the ones we currently have . 
  we should also look towards promoting the birthrate of native europeans as currently they are at abysmal rates , rates in fact that fail to maintain a healthy population growth in the long run . 
  i also do n't argue that all immigration is bad , what i see however is europe tends to accept any and all immigration and is not selective about it . 
  the criminality of immigrants coming in is far higher than that of the local populations as well . 
  europe is currently in the midst of a huge financial crisis , and most european countries face large debt to gdp ratios . 
  current immigration policies from outside of europe are a net-loss on the economy and provide no tangible benefit . 
  refugees often do not return home . 
  they end up staying in their host country . 
  it 's the destruction of western civilization and culture i worry most about . 
  islam is the inherent opposite of a free society . 
  europe had/has a huge problem where the local population was not breeding enough to replace themselves and instead of encouraging population growth , the governments of europe decided to instead open up the floodgates of african/middle east immigration . 
  the american dod publish a report a few years ago detailing the issues of islam in europe , which can be found here : http://www.dod.gov/pubs/foi/international_security_affairs/other/09-f-0759thefutureofeuropeand_its_muslims__four_scenarios.pdf the discrimination argument is often cited but failed to be proven . 
  here is another article describing the second generation of muslim immigrants in the us also being more religious . 
  http://iipdigital.usembassy.gov/st/english/article/2006/12/20061214174958berehellek0.8237268.html here you can also get a world general view that shows islam as the fastest growing religion world wide : http://www.pewforum.org/2015/04/02/religious-projections-2010-2050/, 
  fastest growing religion in europe . 
  http://time.com/3671514/islam-europe/ 2 . 
  atheism/lack of belief/non-religious . 
  when i said non-religious , it was implied it was a lack of religion . 
  http://www.salon.com/2014/03/25/calling_the_christian_right_soon_you_will_be_outnumbered_partner/ if you understand how europe is a lot less religious , than i fail to see how you could not make the connection . 
  europe , as you would probably agree , is quite progressive/liberal/left wing which in turn promotes anti-religious/non-religious ideals . 
  so for europe , with those cultural values , islam is the fastest growing religion by far . 
  why would that be ? 
  well the answer is two-fold , one of which you alluded to . 
  there are areas that are already predominately muslim , which i see as primarily the baltic region . 
  but another part of that is the huge influx of muslims immigrants/refugees . 
  they do n't adopt european values/culture and stick mainly with their own culture ( aka islam . ), 
  it is well known that second/third generation muslims in europe are far more religious than their parents ( see the thousands that drove off to fight jihad in syria . ), 
  so when one says the immigration of muslims to europe is a silent non-violent invasion , that is referring to the invasion of europe through the womb , not through violence ( as has been the attempt over the past 1400 years . ), 
  but if you want a source for the quote , it was often misquoted from gadaffi , but was uttered by houari boumedienne the former president of algeria . 
  if you want the full quote `` one day , millions of men will leave the southern hemisphere to go to the northern hemisphere . 
  and they will not go there as friends . 
  because they will go there to conquer it . 
  and they will conquer it with their sons . 
  the wombs of our women will give us victory . '', 
  muslims . 
  the fastest growing religion in europe is islam . 
  compare that to the us where atheism/non-religious is the fastest growing . 
  it 's call a silent non-violent invasion . 
  or just you know , not accept asylum seekers . 
  they just become refugees and then just end up staying in europe anyways . 
  hahahahahahha ... you seriously wrote something as retarded as that ? 
  no , european governments are not mostly filled with right wing governments , they are filled with mostly center-left in terms of policies and actions . 
  / r/europe is filled with primarily left-wing attitudes/ideals that have constantly failed europe . 
   loan . 
  it 's a fucking loan you lunatics . 
  guess what ? 
  every political party is funded by both inside and outside influences . 
  i also like how all of you leftists say if she was voted in , it would be a disaster ... like it fucking is n't already ? 
  france is in the shiter , huge amounts of continued immigration , increased crime , insane levels of debt , higher taxes ... what the fuck do you think is the solution here ? 
  more government programs ?

   delis in france ca n't be truly kosher or halal , and must sell pork products . 
  this is completely untrue . 
  there was a story a few months ago about a supermarket that stopped selling alcohol and pork . 
  the problem is that the town had given them a licence as a generic supermarket . 
  they were ordered to respect their licence , that 's all . 
  i am not a le pen supporter and i will never vote for the front national , however , putting the focus on jews is just utter bullshit . 
  she said she would like a ban on all highly visible religious symbols in the public space , including the burkini , large crosses and kippahs . 
  but now it sounds like anti muslims and jews , when in fact what she said is a form of extreme anti religious statement . 
  it 's bullshit and she is stupid , but she did not focus on jews like the title of the article seems to imply . 
  article that returns a 404 for me , by the way . 
  i agree with all you said except this :  and that 's why you do n't shit on individual liberties for populist purposes . 
  unfortunately , for those idiot politicians it 's a win-win situation . 
  they can claim that `` they tried '' and it 's those left-leaning judges fault ; appealing even more to the populist vote . 
  my first thought too . 
  we totally need something like this in france . 
  i heard it on the radio a couple years ago . 
  it stuck with me because my wife was a lecturer in psychology at a french university . 
  according to her , 90 % of students are women that just want to `` expand their horizon '' or something like this . 
  it 's also well known that there are as many 1st year psychology students in france as there are psychologists working as such . 
  i am not trying to defend the stupidity of this mayor , but you just read the title . 
  the statement translated reads : `` already , complaints were filed to prosecute those who spread the photographs of our municipal police officers and those uttering threats against them on social networks . '', 
  it 's about the police work , not burkini photos . 
  you might want to explain your acronyms , because on / r/europe , surprisingly sometimes , not everyone is from the uk . 
  the most in-demand domains to study in france are psychology and sociology . 
  having diplomas from those domains leads to unemployment since there are few jobs . 
  this is stupid !, 
  for one thing , bridal veils do not completely hide a face . 
  secondly , the law has exceptions . 
  thirdly , you only wear a bridal veil in very limited circumstances . 
  it 's ok . just call it `` modesty '' and it becomes totally acceptable . 
  i did . 
  thanks, 
  sorry about this idiot !, 
  but to be fair , cycling has been under a lot of suspicions lately . 
  on a higher note , france will beat her record on the number of medals won , despite the abyssal performance of the french swimmers and cyclists . 
  france is not doing great in rio . 
  0 gold in swimming is very poor . 
  it 's a sea !, 
  no problem , it was quite funny . 
  for those that do not know the term , `` gendarmes '' comes from the french `` gens d'armes '' meaning men at arms . 
   germanderie sounds like a cross between german and gendarmerie .

  how will the dutch track their caravan to france with an electric car ? 
  they will need to recharge it every 200km or so !, 
  they fail to mention the most incredible cave in france , [ la caverne du pont d'arc ] ( http://en.cavernedupontdarc.fr ) . 
  an amazing duplicate has been built and opened last year . 
  a lot older than lascaux and personally , i found it a lot more interesting . 
  the map for france is a bit misleading . 
  it 's split into 22 or so regions that are a lot bigger than most others . 
  at least one region ( around toulouse ) is bigger than the netherlands . 
  even the paris region is a lot bigger than paris and contains a lot of agricultural areas . 
  what does that even mean ? 
  in patents there are two different sets of addresses : 1 . 
  the assignee 's address which is the company 's correspondance address , and could be the company 's hq . 
  the inventors ' addresses which is their residence addresses . 
  i do n't know which one they have used here . 
  also the nice area and sophia antipolis . 
  i was in madrid on vacation a couple weeks ago and the madrid town hall had a huge `` refugees welcome '' sign . 
  i am not against the idea . 
  i think it is too difficult to implement for legal and practical reasons . 
  france has a very strict separation of church and state ( a lot stricter than the usa ) and strong equal protection laws too . 
  it 's completely impossible to have a law applying only to islam , so indeed , like you pointed out , it would apply to all religions . 
  this is probably the biggest hurdle for this kind of laws , and i doubt anything will , in fact , be done . 
  i read some time ago that the average ( possibly median ) pension in france is higher than the average salary . 
  that is pretty ridiculous . 
  in the eu , i would say scotland . 
   1664 that 's french ( kronenbourg ), 
  depending on how the economy is going with brexit and all , the irish government might have enough money to bribe uefa officials . 
  at last important news on this subreddit !, 
  it looks like a dozen losers . 
  that 's news !, 
  i would not call this a sinecure . 
  as far as i can tell , most if not all commissioners are pretty active in their duty . 
  the socialists are very conservative and call themselves progressists . 
  also let 's keep in mind that this is only one person 's stupid opinion and does not reflect anybody else 's . 
  it ' simply because the largest / r/europe group is the brits . 
  unfortunately , when they 'll leave the europe union ( corrected from just `` europe '' , since brits are whining about it ) , they 'll still be whining on / r/europe . 
  rugby has very different rules on who can play for which nation . 
  totally agree with you here . 
  many us office buildings i have been to over the last 20 years were too hot in winter and to cold in summer . 
  so people just opened windows to compensate when they could . 
  ridiculous . 
  not a law specialist , but those are examples of either laws that ca n't be applied anymore or laws made obsolete by other laws . 
  the latter on pants can not be enforced since laws on gender equality are in force . 
  according to a gallup poll via wikipedia , it was 4.5 % in france in 2009 . 
  it 's , i believe , local laws in france . 
  where i live , you can not make too much noise on sunday afternoon/evening . 
  you can mow your lawn after 9am , till midday sunday .

lived in liverpool for years , only thing that was ever stolen from me was a brand new purple bin i forgot to mark . 
  never been to france , have you ? 
  even more so when you consider merkel 's style of leadership . 
  which is wait until the polls tell her what to do . 
  wallonie is part of france , we 'll make it official again next year . 
  the thing is , it 's not a matter of legal possibility , it 's a matter of strength and power , is n't it ? 
  the laws will follow the political will if they have to . 
  otherwise the british empire would still be a thing . 
  yet the usa , india and the likes seem pretty independant to me .

  [ http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/mar/17/westminster-child-abuse-paedophile-ring-failure] ( http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/mar/17/westminster-child-abuse-paedophile-ring-failure ) mps have done this kind of horrors . 
  get the fuck out of this sub you racist twat . 
  it does but since the vast majority of native speakers are from france , we are n't really exposed to those kind of variations . 
  i had never heard of fran\u00e7ais populaire africain before , or of those structures . 
  i reckon french canadian is the one variation most people know exists , but i could n't tell you of their specific variations apart from the accent . 
  plus we are too serious about grammar , we tend to correct people who do n't `` speak properly '' . 
  thanks for explaining that structure !, 
  it 's mad how differently english is used from one place to the other . 
  genuine question , is that a structure a native would use ? 
  i saw her digging through an overturned trashcan behind a teacher-training school in brussels last week . 
  she walked off with a live rat between her teeth .

  is bulgaria a cool country ? 
  are you a chelsea fan ? 
  if not i want you as a mod . 
  it has always been truly aligned , with the usa . 
  good riddance . 
  de gaulle was very much against `` l'europe int\u00e9gr\u00e9e '' , he was in favour of `` l'europe des nations '' . 
  get your facts right . 
  i did see the article you quoted . 
  as i had no idea it existed , do you know of a similar case when it had been used to intervene in a unilateral declaration of independence ? 
  i honestly ca n't say how the french government would react . 
  according to friends who live on both french and spanish catalonia , it seems the french part is n't really bothered with independence , but some spaniards seem pretty keen . 
  so we could more or less stay out of it if we wanted to . 
  on the other hand the uk had a similar situation with scotland and i 'm guessing they would be very reluctant to recognise an independent catalonia if there was a way to avoid it . 
  i honestly do n't see why you think nato would have a major importance in this kind of situation . 
  if anything the eu might put a fair amount of pressure on catalonia when the time comes . 
  but nato ( aka the usa ) ? 
  and no offense but i think there are other players who 'd be more interested in the situation other than poland . 
  let 's not forget a part of geographical catalonia is in france , perpignan and the surrounding area . 
  let 's get serious here . 
  spain has the necessary armed forces to occupy catalonia if needed . 
  they would have nothing to gain on a political plan in calling for nato help except make catalans feel more oppressed by an external entity . 
  thus adding fuel to the fire . 
  i realllly do n't see polish soldiers marching on barcelona . 
  i do n't see force being used to solve the matter at all . 
  you sir are being fairly aggressive . 
  thanks for your reply . 
  i hope the war ends soon . 
  would you be in favour of a military intervention from foreign countries ? 
  i used to play footy with a syrian doctor and was surprised to see he was a strong supporter of bachar al-assad . 
  i assume that 's because of ethnicity/branch of islam he followed . 
  what about a partition of the country ? 
  you get put on a benefit programme without having contributed before ? 
  wtf ? 
  good for you but , how can syria dream of getting out of this mess when the war is over it its best and brightest citizens all emigrate ? 
  i think a lot of french people would place georgia on the wrong continent if they were asked to place it on a map . 
  you have a few good rugby players who play in our top 14 . 
  only idiots call it soccer . 
  we won fair and square . 
  if it was n't for that materazzi cunt we would have had two by now . 
  ca n't believe the italians have a better rep than us . 
  the whole south is basically mafiosi . 
  i remember when my country last won the world cup . 
  do you ? 
   no , it ca n't , because the mess is caused by the eurozone being a very bad currency union . 
  amen . 
   i am both german and british as a brit you must know better than anybody else that a union is hard to build and fragile , the uk came pretty close to an end this year . 
  do you reckon it 's feasible to have a lasting solidarity from bulgaria to portugal and from cyprus to sweden ? 
  a common foreign policy would mean sending troops . 
  will people in the former nation states be ok with their kids dying from a decision , they , as a country , did n't agree with ? 
  it 's a great idea and it already works in some areas like airbus or with ariane . 
  but i think we 're at a point the sovereignty required to go further is simply more than what people are willing to give up , specifically in areas you mentioned . 
  but the key imo is the economy , the euro was a [ fuck up ] ( http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fandd/2014/03/orourke.htm ) and as people are not willing to agree to a federal budget , there can be no fix . 
  it 's the same as optimism , you just accept you 've already lost . 
  it is easier , but there 's simply too much at stake here . 
  i 'm not too sure of what you meant here . 
  what 's at stake ? 
   ps : i do n't think we should ever have a european football team . 
  that would just be unfair to everybody else . 
  true , although world cup celebrations across europe every four years would be fun . 
  you seem to know better than everyone else . 
  how do you explain that from [ a poll made in 2015 ] ( http://www.lefigaro.fr/politique/2015/05/28/01002-20150528artfig00353-referendum-europeen-dix-ans-apres-les-francais-rediraient-non.php ) , 62 % of french voters would say no again ? 
   a united europe is not the end of cultural groups - it might just be the beginning . 
  this is already in motion . 
  during the scottish and catalan recent pushes for independence , one of the arguments in favour of leaving the uk and spain was that being a member of the eu was enough . 
  i do n't want this happening , in france the independentists have very little support .

   noone is forcing them to stay there . 
  well ; if you ca n't find a job in another eu country you ca n't stay there long term . 
  and for non eu countries , you generally wo n't have any visa . 
  and they have no money to move anywhere else in france due to ridiculous housing prices ( poor people are generally stuck with the subsidised social-built flat they currently have ) . 
  so basically ; they are stuck there whether they like it or not . 
  and part of the problem is that those social flats are in themselves a progress because it means we have less homeless people to deal with . 
   how do you catch an employer that bined a resume generally they do a double blind ; with 2 or more ( great looking ) resumee almost identical for the post but one living in a banlieu with a foreign sounding name , and another with a french name in paris and a pretty picture . 
  generally they do it multiple times to avoid an isolated incident and space a few days and do it with a big company , so if they get caught they can investigate and if there are hr-levels orders to act like that they can be nailed down and fined more easily . 
  for small companies it 's harder , but the law still stands legally speaking . 
   i never thought people like that were subtle about their thoughts . 
  please listen to yourself . 
  i 'm not calling you a racist because i do n't know about you and i 'm too lazy/busy to check ; but it 's one of the first things they utter about minorities they do n't like . 
  generalizing everyone as let 's say `` slow and uneducated '' because they live in such neighborhood and their parents gave them such name is in a lot of cases ridiculously wrong . 
   these `` fast lanes '' go both ways as well . 
  there is a good chance the isp would pass the costs on to service providers like netflix and youtube . 
  oh they are already trying . 
  in france , free tried to force google to pay them a dozen billions to let youtube pass ( they did n't outright blocked it but `` forgot '' to do upgrades so when yt released hd video mode that needed more bandwith to work , hd video was unusable and you were forced to lower resolution ) . 
  they got caught ; forced to settle with google and both told to stfu and that if youtube crashed again there would be blood , basically . 
  and i used orange as an example because they tried exactly what i was quoting . 
  they invested in daily motion , and started causing youtube to crash outright on `` buffering '' instead of loading videos . 
  again , they got caught and thrown out . 
  but i suspect it start being very tiring that we internet users have to constantly look over our shoulder not to wonder one day why website x stops working . 
  not even talking about mobile internet bills and phones that goes in `` roaming mode '' for a bazillion euros when you forget steam in background or cross the border to another country 5 km next to you and the gps notes it . 
   employers just drop resumes when they 're from certain banlieues . 
  good luck proving it 's because of that they get punished when caught : https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/discrimination_%c3%a0_l%27embauche yes it do happen . 
  so does assault , drunk driving and theft on a regular basis . 
  does n't mean it 's legal . 
   but you can not have extremist views and want for society to treat you like any normal person . 
  people are n't allowed to * express * hate speech ( or obviously act on it ) . 
  but you are not allowed to use your position to punish them for their thoughts in their head , and especially not to ask them about it for the sake of honeypotting them and punishing them . 
  and that 's a safeguard for the population . 
   what do people who create such an ideas have in their heads ? 
  well ; like every corporations , they like money . 
  for them the more money they have the better . 
  everything else is secondary to that consideration for corporations . 
  and they do n't care if it damages society . 
  that 's why we need regulations ; to put limits . 
  like by enforcing net neutrality . 
   there 's no law that prevents anyone from talking current events . 
  no , but there are laws preventing him from influencing your carreer in consequence or firing you or punishing you for example . 
  or if you can prove he dropped your cv specifically about that , or ( more likely if he 's caught asking you such questions during the interview ( there are agents in civil posing as prospects doing anonymous controls on the topic . 
  some associations against racism are also well known to do it ) . 
   what would you do if an employee is rowdy ? 
  good point . 
  i would document his attitude for a short span of time at least , possibly using legal security cameras in the general office ( e.g : film him screaming or harassing somebody or being generally rowdy ) . 
  and then if he does n't get the message , i 'd fire him using that as an argument . 
  that 's perfectly legal . 
   in a lot of schools many kids didnt understand that and then they 're amazed they 'll always be on the fringe of society the reverse is also very true : a lot of kids know they will be on frings of society either way so they quickly stop giving a crap about said society and especially what it 's public representants ( officials , cops , ... ) tell them . 
   they want more police and stronger police ca depend ou et pourquoi . 
  * depends where and for what . 
  as a frenchman who was regularly frisked ( because i must have a face for it ) ; i 'm clearly not against retraining everyone . 
  *  btw , would you ever hire a dude that thinks the charlie hebdo deserved it ? 
  well the rule of thumb is not talking about politics with your employer . 
  there 's even a couple laws on the subject preventing him from asking you . 
  unprovocated violence is n't tolerated anywhere however ; it 's very well known . 
  on a personnal level , id ' b be more warry of right wingers ( front national nazis ) , but that 's just me . 
  well ; it would certainly change the attitudes of police and therefore attitudes of banlieusards toward police over a couple years . 
  and yes a lot of frenchs wants the attitude of police to change , even if the problem is a lot less present than before with partial reforms . 
   well i gave up tv over a decade ago . 
  i love the internet but just like any addiction it can be overcome . 
  yeah like an addiction to use forks to eat or water to shower or switching on the heater during the coldest of winter . 
  you can survive without , but your lifestyle takes a hit . 
   i wo n't die without it . 
  no , but you will not be able to write emails anymore and will have to phone in for everything . 
  you wo n't be able to know the status of your account . 
  you wo n't be able to get instant news . 
  you wo n't be able to easily share pictures with your friends . 
  or get games . 
  or work from home easily . 
  better carry paper maps to go anywhere . 
  and keep a phone book to find anyone 's number . 
  and ... 
  there 's some point at which the police will have to understand that they do n't get to write the law , merely enforce it . 
  especially when it 's in everyone 's else 's interest . 
   with a median income over 6 times ukraine so rich they have so many homeless citizens they officially declared situation of emergency : http://edition.cnn.com/2015/10/17/us/hawaii-homeless-emergency/  detroit is over 3 times ukraine . 
  and people were so poor they were getting banned from water and power utilities for bills they could n't afford anymore . 
  let that sink in , * they could n't afford tap water anymore * . 
   detroit is heavily reliant on aid from the rest of the country . 
  and about time ; because when that started to happen people where talking about burning down public buildings . 
   that wo n't happen though - yanukovich , 2014 , word for word  we are n't anywhere near poor enough for a bloody revolution watch detroit or hawaii . 
  tell me how living there is any better than living in ukraine ? 
   to yield a positive result . 
  it 's like a natural catastrophe . 
  it 's frequently very negative , but you have to account for it . 
  if you ignore everyone for too long and do n't do anything about it , pressure keeps pilling till the volcano explode . 
  now i 'm not saying it should be illegal to be rich or whatever , i 'm not stupid . 
  but when some people are holding back from society what amounts basically to several percents of a national governemental budget and a very large amount of citizens is in trouble and you refuse to account for it or cutting them some economic slack and just answer with `` it 's my money i do n't owe you anything !, 
  '' , you 're in trouble . 
   this is n't the world of 1789 . 
  if you 're rich and there 's social unrest in 2015 you get on your private jet and go where you want . 
  well ; if a ferguson-like protest ends up like the arab springs , and the europe follows , there wo n't be much anywhere to hide apart maybe third world countries . 
   thanks to globalization you do n't even have to worry about your assets being stuck in country either . 
  until we start freezing and re allocating accounts in the dozens of billions to trillion range after largescale abuse . 
   in other words , in 2015 the rich have no incentive to make sure the peasants do n't rebel , so again , why should people who like making money start businesses in areas with high crime and low skills ? 
  and when your entire living space is `` high crime and low skills '' , what happens ? 
  `` why should i pay the peasants a living ? '', 
  \\* points at syria , libya and ukraine \\*, 
  more likely they 'll start blocking out whatever site they do n't like and you 'll loose access to huge chuncks of the internet over time depending on where you are and what 's your provider and who owns it . 
  then the gov will use the providers ' new found power and remove any website they do n't like either that way . 
  so , it means that one day your provider might decide they do n't like reddit , and welp you ca n't access it anymore .

  swiss are stereotyped here for liking sports and being outdoorsy , much more so than the the french . 
  i honestly did n't know that . 
  but you also have to account for the lack of eu funds ( which may only be partially be taken up by a conservative uk governement ) and the lack of cheap labor from immigrants which both will have an impact on the price . 
  food is cheaper outside the eu but it wo n't be cheaper in the uk . 
  if there is a fta between the uk and the us including agricultural products , you can be certain it will be a huge crisis for the british farmers because they are not competitive . 
  most french farmers when it comes to meat and milk barely make any profit ( approximately 1 $ net benefit per beef cattle head ) and i doubt that the british are much more advanced than their continental counterparts when it comes to farming . 
  the us however ... you ca n't really compete with their huge farms . 
  exactly , they just might be less competitive than domestic british farmers though . 
  which is great for the british producers but they too in turn will suffer just the same from the competition of domestic eu27 farmers who will not have tariffs . 
  in the end , the irish farmers might lose a lot there . 
  it seems it 's an eastern mediterranean thing . 
  could it be also because you guys do n't walk as much , using cars much more . 
  that and coca-cola all the time . 
  i know that people do not walk as much in french polynesia due to the heat and the fact that everybody uses their cars there , and they tend to be a bit more fat than the continental french . 
  it once was ( middle ages ) a pilgrimmage spot just as famous as compostela or rome . 
  donald trump is 33 years older than melania trump . 
  brigitte macron is 25 years older than emmanuel macron . 
  why are you only bothered by the latter ? 
  i think she wanted some but could n't have them . 
  i doubt she 's the kind of woman who would adopt a poor african orphan though . 
  it 's been proven times and times again that video games had no impact on teenager 's violence . 
  porn though , i do n't know , it seems fallacious . 
  even for bdsm , people who are deemed deviants by the puritans like may should be able to access their niche content online . 
  i tend to think that in a free country you can wank to whatever you want . 
  macron on porn : `` porn ? 
  it 's just a part of life ! '' .

   the capital markets union is an eu initiative which aims to deepen and further integrate the capital markets of the 28 eu member states . 
   the capital markets union aims to :  provide new sources of funding for businesses , especially for small and medium-sized enterprises  reduce the cost of raising capital  increase options for savers across the eu  facilitate cross-border investing and attract more foreign investment into the eu support long-term projects  make the eu financial system more stable , resilient and competitive  to achieve these goals , the european commission has proposed an action plan containing a number of steps for a gradual building of the capital markets union to be completed by 2019 . 
  most of the actions are focused on shifting financial intermediation towards capital markets and breaking down barriers that are blocking cross-border investments . 
   the action plan includes a range of tools , from eu legal acts to support for initiatives led by the industry . 
  the project supports and complements the investment plan for europe initiative , which is designed to boost investment in the eu . 
   short-term measures under the action plan :  a package of two legislative proposals on securitisation  a review of existing rules on prospectuses  new rules on solvency ii to be applied to infrastructure projects  consultation on covered bonds  consultation on venture capital and social entrepreneurship funds  call for evidence on the cumulative impact of current financial rules http://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/policies/capital-markets-union/,

  i like how some british conservatives try to take the high stand over marine le pen while they pander to the same demographics shamelessly and use even stronger policies . 
  theresa may is dangerous imho . 
  she 's more competent than trump but there is something awfully authoritarian in a british way about her . 
  nato is an international treaty with countries like turkey , the us and canada in it . 
  the european union defence projects and nato coexist . 
  but it has been decided more or less implicitely ( nothing written in the treaties ) that the eu would not interfere with nato . 
  that being said , it 's two parallel things and some countries would rather pursue a european defence initiative . 
  ireland being a neutral country much like switzerland is n't completely involved in nato nor in any european union defence project from which they always opt-out , these things are always voted on a consensual basis leaving the rights to individual country to opt-out . 
  i think that part of the problem pindar_mc is mentionning is the lack of research in gender-specific causes for male suicides : ptsd , issues at school ... most `` neets '' ( not in education employment or training ) are men too , but nobody really wonders why . 
  there is a social problem there and i do n't think feminism is the answer . 
  there is a difference between a commercial product being discriminatory and a eu-regulated standard for a product . 
  if the standard of quality for the same product is not the same accross the union it could be ground for a consumer right litigation on the ground of unfair discrimination . 
  but even that is a reach . 
  it will be up to the company to prove that the difference of quality accross the border is justifiable . 
  which is actually very debatable because a company has some freedom to do what it wants and the consumer to `` not buy '' products that are of inferior quality . 
  can a company be expected to hold the same standard of quality for their products accross the union ? 
  in the same vein , the eu regulation on food is mostly related to mandatory information so the consumer knows what he buys . 
  if the information on the ee packages is proven to be false , there could be troubles but at the same time , if it is true , then , the consumer is informed and ca n't complain . 
  at any rate , a country ca n't really regulate on what is a baguette or not and such ( like what is the level of alcohol a beer needs to have to be a beer ) . 
  if you do you risk entering the cursed grounds of ... qrmee ( quantitative restructions and measures having equivalent effects ) . 
  the eu do n't like that . 
  at all . 
  i 'm not sure it 's a middle name . 
  i read it 's her full name because her parents are divorced so she takes both names . 
  women can be opposed to furthering the cause of women emancipation and gender equality . 
  take marion mar\u00e9chal le pen for exemple , she 's anti-abortion because she says she was `` an accident '' . 
  the biggest biggot of french politics is a woman too ( christine boutin ) . 
  marion represents the `` right wing '' of the fn party , philippot the `` left wing '' . 
  marion is very catholic and anti-abortion , for one . 
  marine le pen is a bit in the middle but she offloaded her father because he was a burden , too extreme . 
  she 's not the biggest advocate for women but she 's somewhat feminist as she used to be a lawyer defending women victims of domestic abuse . 
  her number 2 , philippot , is very anti-euro , but he 's also more socially liberal , some people say he 's behind the fact that marine le pen never took a stand on gay marriage , as he is gay himself . 
  so yeah , if you think marine is batshit crazy , meet the niece . 
  i talk about religion because that 's been the defining political topic for marion mar\u00e9chal le pen . 
  your comment is just as hollow as your convictions . 
  you wrote two paragraphs yet there is no content in it . 
  if you 're truly a euro-federalist , you should hope that the next polish governement is going to work towards harmonization of taxes and minimum wages accross the union to increase the quality of life of its citizens . 
  a level-playing field when it comes to public tenders and general social dumping would be beneficial to all of us . 
  because you know ... if you 're a federalist , you think about the wellbeing of all the citizens in the eu , not just how lowering or stabilizing the wages of the polish workers under what qualifies as the poverty line in germany ( for example ) will allow corporations to exploit your poor workers shamelessly or by domino effect , drag down the hard earned rights of the western european workers to the point where they have to work inhumane hours and be payed almost nothing . 
  that 's not what i 'm saying . 
  and i 'm not just talking about france but countries with expensive social services . 
  europe has to move forward . 
  otherwise it 's france who is going to exit . 
  to move forward with countries led by eurospetics like poland without breaking the union you need a two-speed europe . 
  that 's all there is to it . 
  macron has the mandate for that . 
  if he does n't deliver on that , it 's le pen in 5 years . 
  poland is both the biggest net recipient of eu aid and the largest provider of cross-border labor , social dumping is a real issue for the western part of the union at the moment . 
  it is also the most anti-russian member of the eu ( that being said i 'll gladly concede that putin does n't need help from anyone to look bad ) , it is also the most unwilling country to move forward with the migrant crisis , and it does n't even have the $ . 
  it is reluctant to eu military over nato . 
  given all that maybe you should reconsider your position on which country is acting on the best interest of the union and which one is slowing it down because of petty interests . 
  i 'll give you a hint , it 's the one who 's capable of holding up a complete brussel summit over a petty national squabble . 
  there are no threats . 
  you talk about cooperation and compromise but that 's what i 'm telling you . 
  poland does n't do that . 
  that 's why it wont work !, 
  there is some subtext to it . 
  poland has been on france 's shitlist for a while now and it wo n't change until the next polish administration . 
  this is actually the first time in history that france is at odds with both russia and poland at the same time , usually there 's always one on our side . 
  remember the mistral deal with russia ? 
   poland had indeed threatened to break off negotiations [ with france ] , which covered 50 caracal helicopters worth $ 2.5 billion , if we delivered the ships few months later  the polish ministry of economic development has announced the end of negotiations over a potential offset deal with airbus helicopters , indicating that the ministry of defence will not purchase caracal military transport helos for the country 's military . 
  and more recently  with theresa may absent , leaders from warsaw and budapest will puncture any mood of self-congratulation .

  move on , adapt to change . 
  the newspaper crisis is n't going to get any better . 
  i 'm sure that in a century , if not half a century , the idea of newspapers will seem almost archaic . 
  that 's bullshit . 
  if so many put their lives on the line to get in it 's because even as an illegal the eu is attractive , thanks to these pro-immigration groups who whine about helping migrants all the time . 
  they 're to blame . 
  the death of these people is ironically on their hands . 
  if we took away the incentives for illegal immigration , there would n't be any . 
  `` fortress europe '' my ass . 
  in france we hear this every wednesday at 12 , in memory of ww2 , so i do n't find the sound scary in any way ... 
  but do n't be worried . 
  greece is n't close from getting bombed any time soon , unless greece declares war on someone , which i doubt it would . 
  germans often mention bavaria when regional independence subjects are discussed because in the end it 's the only region of germany which comes close to what could have an independence movement . 
  they ca n't picture any better example for their country , simply because there is no good example in germany for that sort of thing , compared to other countries . 
  but ultimately , bavaria wo n't be independent in any foreseeable future . 
  i 'm not blaming iran at all for that ... wtf ? 
  oh please , be fair and read the damn article . 
  the article clearly says that there were exceptions - even though most of them involve `` democratic '' countries ( with quotes ... ) . 
  but otherwise , which war has iran fought recently , other than the one against the non-democratic state of iraq ? 
  ( which thus confirms the article , even if you consider iran democratic ) . 
  i can think of others too , which the article did n't mention . 
  like the recent russian-georgian war , or the 1918-20 armenian -- azerbaijani war . 
  but they 're still exceptions . 
  who will collect the million dollars of prize money though ? 
  the european institution ? 
  because , one million dollars is kind of nothing compared to the money the eu is handling ... 
  but otherwise , it would be a disgrace if anyone in the eu commission or parliament got the prize money . 
  as a frenchman , spain and catalonia being our southern neighbor , i probably feel more concerned than others about this ( france is the only neighbor of spain and catalonia ) - except for the spanish themselves of course . 
  i do n't really know how i feel about it . 
  i 'm all for national minorities ' rights to self determination , and i do n't think the spanish government should have the right to stop the process if the people vote for their independence . 
  but then again , it 's kind of sad for spain , losing a big chunk of their territory . 
  i guess the idea of independence is an exciting new prospect . 
  if they get independence , and catalonia is economically successful , we 'll get to learn catalan in schools :p, 
  ahaah that was awesome ... but it could have been far more offensive . 
  hey , it 's better than our former french minister 's franglish : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=julmkvvfyda, 
  actually , it was , yes . 
  human rights , animal rights , anti-racist laws , children 's rights , women 's rights , anti-slavery , religious freedom laws , social rights , equality , war regulations on chemical weapons , . . etc. . . tell me . . where do those modern concepts all come from initially ? 
  from which civilization 's philosophical views ? 
  does that stem from european enlightenment ideas ? 
  or perhaps from islamic scholarly discourse ? 
  or chinese philosophy ? 
  or mayan ideas ? 
  really , tell me . . where do those come from ? 
  i wonder . 
  french journalists and even anti-racist groups ( when they 're willing to be honest ) all agree that most acts of anti-semitism in france are caused by immigrants of muslim background . 
  i can provide links for this to you if you wish , but those links will be in french . 
  agreed . 
  this sickens me . 
  i fucking love shellfish . 
  it could be my only source of meat for a year and i 'd be happy . 
  i wish they had frozen a metric ton of their shellfish and gave it to me for a year . 
  i see you put quotes on `` inferior '' , even though i did n't use that word , no one does , and no one considers any region of france `` inferior '' . 
  basically , you chose that word , so do n't put quotes on it as if i , or someone else , said it . 
  that 's the worst kind of rhetoric technique out there . 
  and please do n't throw me your fake offense . 
  i was n't suggesting that wallonia should join france , but was merely making a point about how it 's not that big a deal that regions have differences , as long as they have common ground . 
  i merely said that , to the french , a walloon region would n't make much of a difference . 
  now , if you want my opinion , i admit that i am french of walloon origin , and would myself welcome a union since i do n't see wallonia as much different to france , than the french region of picardie is to the french region of aquitaine . 
  actually ... wallonia is closer to picardie in terms of customs and speak than picardie is to aquitaine ... if you see what i mean . 
  also , being a region of france does n't negate regional identity , just so you know ... french regions have extremely strong regional identities , to the point that neighboring regions mock eachother constantly , just like neighboring countries do - yet ultimately , when they 're abroad , or when they vote in national elections , or when they support a national team , they 're french , and it 's a beautiful thing . 
  wallonia has more ties with it 's neighboring french regions than with any place else ( except flanders of course , by obligation ) . 
  you can hate it if you like , it does n't make it less true . 
  otherwise , the surveys i 've seen on the subject say the walloon people are pretty divided on the subject , and about half would welcome a union if belgium explodes ( though i 'm of those who thinks it 's unlikely since your situation has gone on for years and nothing in that direction has been done ) . 
  http://vupar.org/2010/04/22/le-rattachisme-de-la-wallonie-a-la-france-vu-par-les-wallons-et-les-francais-en-2008/ http://www.atlantico.fr/decryptage/rattachement-wallonie-france-belgique-flandres-bruxelles-300-jours-sans-gouvernement-rwf-74454.html and i 'm not mentioning that minister of yours who mistakenly sang the * marseillaise * when asked to sing the belgian national anthem . 
  half the work is done there , man . 
  i think you got it right . 
  the eu provides the feeling of defense that the national countries , turned insignificant in size and power compared to the eu , do n't anymore . 
  although deep down i 'm all for national sovereignty for all peoples ( and europe is diverse at that !, 
  ) , i too dislike the trend and wish people would feel more united - and consider their differences as regional differences , not national . 
  i mean , some countries are more united than others and less likely to have breakups , and would thus hold even more leadership of the eu as bigger , richer , and most populous remaining countries ( like france hardly has any secession movements , except corsica and it stays moderate , or germany - i 'm french btw ) . 
  i can clearly see many countries splitting into the size of catalonias , and france and germany remaining the only `` big '' countries in western europe , even if one or two of their regions ( unlikely ) split . 
  this will create a big gap between the big countries , and the small regions surrounding them and all leaching on . 
  to a frenchman , those `` differences '' seem very minor ( i mean really ? 
  the flemish are introvert ? 
  and that 's a reason to not consider them the same people as the extrovert dutch ? ) . 
  i mean , between the north and the south of france , it 's a totally different attitude , but all agree they 're french anyway . 
  that 's why , to a frenchman , wallonia could easily be another region of france if they wanted to , since they 'd have their regional difference while still having very broadly a similar culture ( and of course , the same language ) . 
  i really do n't want to sound condescending , but i 'm guessing that as relatively small country ( netherlands ) , the concept of a country harboring slightly different regional cultures seems weird to you , since your country is small enough so that the culture from one end of the country to the other is relatively very similar . 
  but in reality , most countries have regions with significantly different cultures , but those regions found a common ground to make a country . 
  the common ground between the dutch and the flemish seems pretty clear to an outsider , much more than that of texas and vermont , or lille and marseille , or sicily and venice , or wallonia and flanders ... 
  chances are both ( netherlands and flanders ) would gain from it , since they 're both economic powerhouses ( only limited by their small size ) , their union would make their voice more important to the rest of the world . 
  preferably this way , and with a harvey keitel ` stache : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clwru8v1rmo&amp;t=1m40s, 
  i think the eu should seek the following countries : - those with a similar standard of living : median salary , minimum wage and social rights ... like france , germany , benelux countries , scandinavian countries , austria , uk ... 
  some countries which are now in the eu simply are n't at the same standards economically , and north-western european countries should wait , and help the others reach their economic standards before accepting them in the union ( there can still be a schengen treaty for free market ... ) . 
  - the people of the countries must want to join . 
  for example , there should be a referendum with 60 % minimum yes vote to join or something . 
  perhaps , the countries already in the eu should vote too , to know if they want to accept the new countries , with a minimum 50 % yes vote average for all of them . 
  this is basically for legitimacy . 
  so it does n't feel forced . 
  it must be a reciprocal agreement by the people . 
  - the boundaries of europe are the mediterranean in the south , the black sea , the caucasus mountains , the urals in the east , and iceland in the north-west . 
  russia could join if it wants to , since their civilization is european . 
  turkey should n't . 
  malta ( already a member ) is european enough , and anyway it 's insignificant so it 's not really a problem if they 're in the eu or not . 
  same for cyprus . 
  as for caucasus countries , i guess it depends on the country . 
  it remains to be debated but i think the question of them joining should n't be on the table as long as russia has n't ... 
  the black blocs call themselves black blocs , not the media whom i 've never seen misrepresent them . 
  i 'm talking of personal experience with these guys . 
  i just do n't like them .

good on you for encouraging gypsie crime,

  tampere is such a strange city, 
  my dad served on it !, 
  got any funny stories about it since its been brasilian ? 
  it is , it 's article 7 , and the possibility of it happening seems more and more likely . 
  i hope it does , we need to get this over with . 
  lol, 
  yeah i think i 'm the one who deist really get what is going on haha, 
  no i mean the guy who responded to you reacted as if you were serious and i was telling him you were kidding, 
  he is clearly joking, 
  france is n't s military power ? 
  same in paris 50 $ flat rate which is nice, 
  of course but there are n't a huge amounts of solutions available . 
  they have cleared the camp before , but they settled back . 
  they ca n't just jail 10000 men women and children . 
  they ca n't send them back to where they came from because they have no papers . 
  this is n't limited to the uk in any way, 
  you do realize that if the tunnel was in the netherlands then that 's where all the migrants would go ? 
  the same deadlock would still exist . 
  the french government is incompetent granted , but if they had a workable solution they would have done it already . 
  shhhhhhhhhh, 
  waaaaah poor oppressed turks, 
  i think we all are at the moment haha , no problem !, 
  turkey giving up their accession bid ? 
  nobody wants them in europe to begin with , i do n't get your point . 
  does anybody actually care ? 
  if you do n't directly qualify for a scottish passport , you 're pretty much boned :(, 
  dear god, 
  nothing but do n't go complaining when you get what you want : borders . 
  says the country leaving the eu because muh sovereignty we are n't the trumpists in this story , you are . 
  because our flag got eaten by germany , we moved up , did n't try to take it back because we gave our clay to europe , and now we have to give up the land south that we built around ( while making sure to protect megaman ) . 
  now without asking france , you guys come in , take the land in the south for italy ( who has a huge flag to beginwith ) , destroy megaman , and we should be thanking you ? 
  it 's a pixel flag , it obviously does n't matter at all , but do n't act like you guys are n't being cunts lol, 
  so we should be thanking you ? 
  lol, 
  i do n't know but in the meantime we have relocated multiple times and now we are losing our flag again, 
  that 's rich coming from a german, 
  we gave up our rightful clay to calm the german aggression , and now we have to give up more of our flag ? 
  build your own, 
  what are your thoughts on nelson mandela ? 
  correct, 
  did n't know that this makes the whole situation even better enjoying this greatly, 
  have you ever seen a grown man naked ? 
  because they could sail down the seine and siege paris , but also discover canada pretty cool, 
  20 day account with 0 knowledge of european political systems weighing in on the french election . 
  hmmm, 
  i understand that . 
  what i 'm saying is all these people flying these drones have to do to make it nearly impossible for falcons and eagles to take them down is put razor wire on them . 
  i do n't see how any of your arguments solve that problem . 
  it may be a good solution now , but it will be obsolete very soon . 
  it 's a waste of money, 
  i 'm not saying there are n't ways to take out a drone , i 'm saying using an eagle to do it seems stupid, 
  is n't that easily counterable ? 
  just put spikes all over the drone ? 
  of course haha, 
  yes you nazi, 
  it 's also the layout of the city that is bad imo . 
  from my experience drivers are pretty terrible everywhere , you just notice it less when cities are more simple to drive in, 
  two blocks to the left and one block down and you 'll find the best roman street food i have found after multiple visits to the city , da simo pane e vino so good, 
  `` oh look bradleys ! '', 
  `` mhm '' exactly how i would be with any girl i 've been with ; made ma laugh out loud . 
  i never said i cared , i could n't give two shits , but it 's still true, 
  you 're being down voted but it 's pretty much common knowledge in certain circles . . 
   regular left like m\u00e9lenchon ?? 
  very little , no . 
  the socialist party has more or less imploded . 
  where are you from ? 
  i 'm in rennes, 
  i do too , i just googled it haha, 
  we just speak french and hope some of the words we use are also used in english, 
  rip, 
  ( ( ( advertising ) ) ) / s, 
   it can be assumed stop making assumptions about things you clearly know nothing about, 
  absolutely i 'm much more hopeful about our election than i was only months ago, 
  well my options are 1 ) you 're trying to be funny 2 ) you do n't know anything about ancient history ( which is fine ) so since nothing you have said is funny , by default i chose option 2 . 
  listen i 'm willing to explain it to you , i just ca n't tell if you are taking the piss or not . . 
  are you joking or have you never read a history book ? 
  i get what you 're saying , and agree , to a certain extent . 
  first of all , ( i realize you are n't implying this ) it 's important to insist on the fact that nobody asked america to send their soldiers to the middle east to get killed . 
  if anything , the united states asked europe to follow them to afghanistan , and they did . 
  the u.k. and poland ( stupidly ) followed you to iraq too . 
  secondly , the protection of europe is also in the united states ' own interest . 
  let 's not act like it 's pure selflessness . 
  for the record , i 'm half french half american , and consider both parts of my identity equally important, 
  oh god i 'm laughing so hard, 
  can somebody explain how this is funny to me ? 
  i know where it 's from , i love qi , but i just do n't find this funny and i want in on the laughs, 
  drives ( lol ) me crazy bought my 2014 golf , well , in 2014 . 
  now i 'm stuck with it for at least 8 years or so and i know it pollutes . 
  + to act tough of diesel now ( which they should ) , prices are sky rocketing . 
  hate it, 
  lol all these guys are poor as dirt and live with the constant threat of death wooow , so much profiting from the situation, 
  that 's what makes their stuff a lot more defensible though , and incidentally shows they you have no idea what you are talking about they make fun of french tragedies more often than foreign ones ... you do n't have to like it or find it funny , but you ca n't accuse them of double standards because they do n't really have any, 
  i think what he she means is that ch have n't changed what they do for more attention or anything . 
  they have been like this for decades, 
  based gulf stream, 
  go away, 
  which is a privilege,

  this is fine if you want to run an economy for those aged 18 to 34 ; it 's problematic when your 40 and 50 year olds face job insecurity .

   my reading of the most recent ons reports are than inequality in the uk is decreasing . 
  you confuse `` income '' with `` wealth '' , which is what we were discussing . 
  i 'd be reluctant to read too much into the most recent report , as the previous year 's one says :  estimates of income inequality for 2014/15 are broadly unchanged from those for the previous financial year ( any differences are not statistically significant ) . 
  -----  why would hundreds of thousands of people move to the uk for work every year ? 
  because they can earn over 3 x in a precarious uk job than they would in a * safe * job in their home country . 
  [ the world 's new numbers ] ( http://wilsonquarterly.com/quarterly/spring-2009-decline-or-renewal/the-worlds-new-numbers/ ) from 2009 but worth a read , especially by those who obsess over migration and demographics . 
  * ... the detailed statistical work of demographers tends to seep out to the general public in crude form , and sensationalist headlines soon become common wisdom . 
  * * because of this bastardization of knowledge , three deeply misleading assumptions about demographic trends have become lodged in the public mind . 
  the first is that mass migration into europe , legal and illegal , combined with an eroding native population base , is transforming the ethnic , cultural , and religious identity of the continent . 
  the second assumption , which is related to the first , is that europe 's native population is in steady and serious decline from a falling birthrate , and that the aging population will place intolerable demands on governments to maintain public pension and health systems . 
  the third is that population growth in the developing world will continue at a high rate . 
  allowing for the uncertainty of all population projections , the most recent data indicate that all of these assumptions are highly questionable and that they are not a reliable basis for serious policy decisions . 
   adults , who will produce children ( original 2 becomes 6 people ) fertility rate of muslims in europe is 2.1 . 
  see above . 
  so the original two becomes four . 
  after 20 years , the two kids add two more ( 6 ) . 
  after 20 years , the two kids add two more ( 8 ) . 
  after 20 years , the two kids add two more , but the grandparents die ( 8 ) ... and so on . 
  [ apparently they 're looking for another 6 % cuts ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-39110688 ) , but maybe it 's a bait and switch and they 'll announce next year that the planned cuts have been cancelled because everyone 's been so good and brexity . 
   wealth disparity is decreasing in the uk and has been for a few years now . 
  really ? 
  what makes you say that ? 
  from the independent last year : the richest 1 per cent of the population have as much wealth as the poorest 57 per cent combined , according to office for national statistics figures . 
  the agency also found overall wealth inequality has increased since 2012 , mainly thanks to the soaring price of housing in the south-east of england and london . 
  the news came just 24 hours after the head of the government 's child poverty watchdog , alan milburn , warned that britain is in danger of becoming an `` ever-more divided '' society , making a mockery of david cameron 's `` one nation '' rhetoric . 
  http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/inequality-richest-one-per-cent-have-as-much-wealth-as-the-poorest-57-per-cent-combined-a6779201.html from the ifs last year : the wealthiest 1 % of households hold about 20 % of household wealth , the top 5 % of hold approximately 40 % , and the top 10 % hold over 50 % of wealth ( see table 1 of alvaredo et al. ) . 
  these authors also find that household wealth in the uk has become more concentrated since the turn of the century . 
  unfortunately , the data available do not permit more concrete statements about the extent to which this is the case . 
  http://www.ifs.org.uk/publications/8239 from the ft in 2015 : uk wealth inequality widens for first time in a decade the figures will be problematic for the conservative government because they ** break a run of flat inequality measures ** for both income and wealth , and suggest that the tory slogan that everyone is in it together does not hold true . 
  https://www.ft.com/content/1ad5c43a-a593-11e5-a91e-162b86790c58 i 'm interested in the basis for your assertion . 
   as for job security , there is a global trend away from conventional 9-5 employment towards more flexible working , but i think that a lot of people like that trend . 
  certainly a lot of employers love the erosion of workers ' rights , but i 'd assume you agree that there are plenty of people who do n't like the trend away from job security ? 
  my point stands - labour should be able to put together a more appealing platform . 
  i am amazed that british labour can not come up with a persuasive platform in these days of ever increasing wealth disparities , greater job insecurity , and reinforced barriers to social mobility . 
  corbyn is quite useless , but i do n't see how they can get him out if he wo n't resign . 
  presumably this gives the tories a free run for the next ge , so they can continue to impose austerity and presumably privatize anything that might earn their cronies a few quid .

  march 17 is paddy 's day , which is a proxy for irish independence day because we do n't have an official independence day . 
  * sacrifices pigeon , disembowels and pushes entrails around * this augurs well ... ------ anyway , did n't may just say a day or two ago that there 's no need for a new scottish referendum ? 
  for irish i see three , but i 'd have thought four ? 
  nominative , genitive , dative , and ( in a limited sense ) vocative . 
  the rule concerns restrictive and non-restrictive relative clauses . 
  a non-restrictive relative clause must always be introduced by * which * and should be separated from the rest of the sentence by commas . 
  a restrictive relative clause can be introduced by * that * or * which * and does not need to be separated by commas . 
  how long are they likely to serve ? 
  i 'm reminded of [ this case ] ( http://www.dublinlive.ie/news/dublin-news/christopher-coleman-death-disqualified-driver-12648870 ) in dublin recently . 
  killer initially got 2.5 years , but that was appealed by the state and increased to 6 years , with the last 2 years and 9 months suspended . 
   macron wants to push eurozone integration further , notably with the creation of a common investment budget and a joint finance minister . 
  looks like the 2nd round will be a proxy for a referendum on french withdrawal from the eurozone .

  no , because it 's grotesque humour and the polish one particularly is pushing the limits . 
  but what the fuck business is it of yours what i find funny ? 
  yep , they were that funny !, 
   you can be that special snowflake lol , ca n't you discuss something without resorting to personal attacks ? 
  beauty of conservatism is that it does n't look at gender . 
  it looks at credo . 
  beauty of liberalism is that it does n't look at hair colour . 
  it looks at principles . 
  beauty of libertarianism is that it does n't look at ancestry . 
  it looks at dogma . 
  beauty of nihilism is that it does n't look at eye colour . 
  it looks at ideals . 
  beauty of existentialism is that it does n't look at shoe size . 
  it looks at beliefs . 
  still no attempt at explanation , just ad hominem as usual . 
   * sheer levels of cognitive dissonance * i 'm rubber and you 're glue . 
  you can keep repeating how `` clear '' your original phrasing was , but at this point you realise deep down that it was a meaningless statement . 
  hopefully you 'll express yourself better next time . 
  awesome !, 
  i lolled out loud . 
  there 's a much better version [ here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tho9-n--k4 ) . 
   the pm is expected to say eu citizens who travel to britain after she triggers article 50 will no longer have the automatic right to stay in the uk permanently . 
  i 'm not a fan of may nor of brexit but this is a logical approach and makes perfect sense . 
  if i decide to go to britain after it has begun the process to leave , i should be aware that i wo n't automatically have the right to stay . 
  what 's reassuring here is that it suggests people who are there now - even those who 've arrived since last june/july - will have the right to stay . 
  ukip remains a farce . 
  the leader recently failed to get elected in stoke , a constituency that voted almost 70 % to leave . 
   beauty of nationalism is that it does n't look at race . 
  it looks at ideology . 
  the beauty of [ define : nationalism ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nationalism ) is that it does n't [ look ] ( http://www.dictionary.com/browse/look ) at race . 
  it ^ ^ that ^ ^ is , ^ ^ a ^ ^ political ^ ^ ideology looks ^ ^ looks ^ ^ with ^ ^ eyes , ^ ^ appears ^ ^ to ^ ^ be at ideology . 
  quite simply , it 's gibberish . 
   there is absolutely nothing unclear about that statement . 
  it 's crystal clear to anyone that can comprehend even passable english . 
   if it is unclear to you , do n't look at the language . 
  look at your own ideological world view . 
  lol , the denial is strong with this one . 
  i offered you an interpretation of what you wanted to say several posts back , but you ignored the interpretation . 
  i honestly still do n't know what the fuck you were trying to say . 
  just do as i say , not as i do . 
  again you seek to obfuscate while accusing me of dodging the issue . 
  you made four separate statements and people may agree with the first three while the last one remains meaningless . 
  go ahead and ask a native english speaker to explain what this means :  beauty of nationalism is that it does n't look at race .

  evil brits . 
   during the war , more than 200,000 members of the polish armed forces in the west had fought under british high command . 
  and those 200k polish were allowed to remain in uk and not be sent back to their homeland . 
  if uk was so evil , why did they remain ? 
  would n't it be nice to thank the uk government and its people for having the kindness to accept them . 
  it 's better to shit on uk because a fucking parade . 
   with that defence you should n't try to silence / u/santo-subito then . 
  i silenced him because of trollish comments \u00e0 la `` cowards ''   the plan is to hide out in a bunker if your ally is attacked  i 'm really starting to understand the defeatist memes about france . 
   did france and uk declare war on germany ? 
   sending a telegram to berlin really deterred their attack in poland . 
  the french are the true heroes of wwii . 
  it is a trollish behaviour since he attempts to raise the tone of conversation with cheap shots . 
  hey i 'm not perfect , but if a comment offers arguments , they should be replied with arguments and not claiming people made statements they never made . 
   i mean apart from this entire apologetic narrative apologetic ? 
  for not wanting a full frontal attack 20 years after 5 % of your population was killed ? 
  yeah i 'm super apologetic about that . 
  they had plans to stick to the maginot line and that 's it . 
  they did their best with the information they had . 
   but once again they got shafted , in the military parade in the uk they were n't even there to be celebrated for their contribution . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish_resettlement_act_1947 yeah fucking uk allowing 200k people the right to remain in uk . 
  they 're disgusting . 
   nope , france did n't lost to spite poland , france lost because their command was incompetent . 
  so be it . 
  no one claims competency when they lose a war , do they ? 
  i do not have any doubt that they did the best with the information and the history they had . 
   now stfu stfu because in france and uk polish troops trained . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish_air_forces_in_france_and_great_britain i respect the effort provided by all nations that helped fight whatever enemies we faced because some keyboard warrior 's opinion does n't mean shit compared to the men and women that died for france or our allies . 
   what 's your point ? 
  that france and uk were underprepared to wage war with germany and that the type of war that was considered was not an offensive war . 
  that 's a fact . 
   o paint yourselves as innocents . 
  what is this ? 
  a trial ? 
  does the french govt have to plead guilty or innocent ? 
  let 's stay historic here . 
   it was you lot who wanted a tough treaty . 
  again stop using `` you '' it 's beyond stupid . 
  it was n't / u/low _ discrepancy doing shit there . 
   not an argument . 
  saying `` i have history on my side '' is an argument ? 
  really ? 
  what book should i crack open to read it ? 
  what sources ? 
  people lose wars . 
  it happens . 
  but do n't you think it 's kinda stupid to blame your allies for losing a war ? 
  you think france or uk were thrilled to lose the war ? 
  do you think france or uk lost in order to spite poland or something ? 
   yes or no , did you lot let hitler get away with retaking the rhineland ? 
  then you 'll complain how the versailles was too rough on the germans ? 
  rhineland was german territory , was it not ? 
   yes or no , did you lot let hitler take czechoslovakia ? 
  i fail to see how that is relevant . 
  did germany beat france and uk because of the sudeten ? 
   i literally have history on my side here , you have snarky quips . 
  if history is bunch of ridiculous rants with no connection between each other , the yeah , you have history on your side . 
  here 's a fun game : post your comment on / r/askhistorians . 
  let 's see it shot down . 
   heck yeah but they did for several months what i do honoring ai dow requests in games : accept and contribute nothing . 
  russia burnt down moscow so they could defeat napoleon . 
  war is n't just attack attack attack . 
  war can also be this . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fabian_strategy the maginot line was based on the idea that the allies had better resources then germany so we 'd just have to wait it out . 
  again https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/maginot_line  french planning for war with germany was always based on the assumption that the war would be la guerre de longue dur\u00e9e ( the war of the long duration ) , in which the superior economic resources of the allies would gradually grind the germans down . 
  you declare a war to win it through whatever means you have at your disposition . 
  if your strategy is a defensive one , then that is your strategy and you hope you worked out sufficient kinks for it to be successful . 
  it was n't . 
  on the eastern front it was . 
  are the russians pissed they won it or pissed they beat napoleon with defensive strategies ? 
  i do n't think so . 
  ok , i 'll stop feeding the troll . 
  you can not talk without insulting people left and right . 
  blocked . 
  gday . 
  indeed . 
  but the strategy of the allies was to have a long war with germany where the country with the most ressources would win . 
  invading germany in sept 39 would have rendered all those plans useless . 
  shit happened and that 's it . 
   you lot and the brits let hitler get away with everything , you let the rhineland be retaken , you let all of czechoslovakia be taken and sat there and did fuck all , then you both guaranteed poland and did fuck all . 
  ah the historian of reddit . 
  wonderful job buddy . 
  wonderful . 
  you sound so level headed too . 
   that 's why he attacked us first , but there was no help for us from france and uk . 
  the major strategy of france was a defensive one . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/maginot_line  french planning for war with germany was always based on the assumption that the war would be la guerre de longue dur\u00e9e ( the war of the long duration ) , in which the superior economic resources of the allies would gradually grind the germans down . 
  did france and uk declare war on germany ? 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/declarations_of_war_during_world_war_ii yes , yes they fucking did . 
  now stfu and have an ounce of respect for people who died for your country . 
  yeah i wonder why a country devastated by a war just 20 years prior was reluctant to start invading left and right . 
  ya know , a country that put basically all its chips on a defensive strategy . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/maginot_line but hey , this is / r/europe and everyone 's an expert here . 
   most notably not allying with countries like france and the uk . 
  true . 
  poland is a great team player . 
  they went into iraq and that was a great success . 
  that still beats the russian hipster . 
  penis leg ? 
   `` aquarium la rochelle '' nice touch . 
  aquariums across france have that .

  the overwhelming majority of soldiers around the world are under the age of 20 . 
  in palestine you 're considered an adult at 16 and can take arms . 
  oh i do n't mean to say that the intent is laudable , but the words alone are not `` wrong '' . 
  obviously they mean more than that in context unfortunately :(, 
  they 're saying jihadists are savages . 
  they 're not wrong . 
  yeah one amphibian ship is a huge threat to the alliance 's collective security . 
  there 's no such thing . 
  it 's called war , there are civilian casualties , especially when the government decides to use everything they can to make the enemy looks like shit internationally . 
  you think high-ranking people in the hamas are sad when children are killed ? 
  they 're happy as fuck . 
  the problem in africa is n't incompetence , it 's systemic corruption . 
  i know people who 've worked there for decades , a lot have given up and do n't think there 's a solution . 
  without context , a `` ban '' implies a lot more than forbidding a protest for one day and one day only , and you know that very well . 
  `` journalists '' are clickbaiting by saying `` france bans pro-palestinian protests ! '', 
  this is exactly what i said in my comment ? 
  they forbid the protest of the 19th because of high tension and security risks . 
  are you really going to say that saying `` death to all jews '' and `` death to hamas '' is similar ? 
  hamas is the reason no solution can be found . 
  there 's no ban , it 's `` journalists '' making it up . 
  one march was cancelled because there were too much provocation and escalation on both sides and it was deemed a security risk for everyone involved . 
  that seems odd . 
  well yeah in cantines and various places reserved for meals sure :p i was thinking in the actual work office . 
  it was allowed ? 
  odd . 
   ( erm ... if it does have that power , that is ) it does n't , it 's still nice to have it `` validated '' . 
  too lazy to murder people !, 
  bears, 
  might as well include lebanon and israel then . 
  and singapor , i like those guys !, 
  are you a writer for the daily mail ? 
  it really is n't , france has nearly 50 % more tourists a year than spain and china . 
  it 's a shittier ( albeit faster ) version of the m\u00e9tro , the problem is that the metro is pretty much only in inner paris while the rer goes through most suburbs , including the shitty ghetto suburbs you do n't want to visit , and some rer stations in those suburbs are ... pretty shady . 
  the quality of m\u00e9tro lines varies quite a bit as well , but in any case you should try to avoid both as much as possible at rush hour , particularly the evening ( 18-20 ), 
  i 've literally never even felt remotely in danger , threatened or `` omg i really need to get out of here '' . 
  inner paris is fine , just avoid taking the rer unless you 're in a hurry , as well as the very north , it 's pretty shitty and there 's not much to see anyway . 
  it 's the suburbs , outside of paris ' walls , that vary greatly in quality , and for the most part there is n't much to see for tourists anyway so i 'd just steer clear of those parts . 
  not to worry though as there is a hell of a lot to see/do/visit in paris intra-muros and it 's very safe there , at worst you can find pickpockets in very touristy areas and various beggars/scammers ; violent crime is close to inexistent . 
  honestly you can probably find a lot of information on the internet , including official french tourist sites like http://en.parisinfo.com/ or http://en.visitparisregion.com/, 
  saying that ex-resistance members were/are in the fn is n't an attempt to link both . 
  besides , the resistance was 80 + % communists . 
  what the fuck ? 
  what exactly have you been doing , touring the shitty suburbs and playing loud music at night from your car ? 
  most of my family has lived in paris all their life and the only person who 's ever been agressed is my aunt who works in a shitty suburb as a psychologist . 
  did n't happen to any of my friends there either , except one who got his iphone stolen because he was drunk and alone in a shitty street at 3 am . 
  except your analogy does n't work at all either . 
  in france ? 
  yeah . 
  granted i do n't actively look for that kind of news but i feel like it would be in papers . 
  what are you even on about ... 
  except we do n't know it has anything to do with racism or xenophobia and the french police said it was more likely a rival gang who beat him up for stealing in their turf and put his body in a public place as an example . 
  gypsi bands commit a variety of crimes , from scams and pickpocketing to blackmail and threats of violence , it 's also not uncommon in the country for them to harass women and scare them . 
  i 've yet to hear of romas murdering or raping anyone though . 
  the problem is that they bring a climate of insecurity and fear in small country towns where they choose to stay , and not only because of their reputation . 
  there are gypsy groups who do n't commit crimes and actually try to integrate but they 're part of a small minority unfortunately . 
  wait is n't the `` hate crime '' part just a supposition ? 
  according to the french police it 's more likely that it was a rival gang who beat him up because he was stealing on their turf ? 
  that 's not even offensive at this point it 's just funny and a little sad . 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc56moy0poa the part about caliphate is very relevant :p, 
  more than you 'd expect i suppose , it 's not uncommon at all , especially older people . 
  i 'm guessing pew assumes that all arabs are muslims or something ? 
  it 's funny because most of the arabs i know either do n't give a shit or are christian ( people from algeria & morocco mostly ) . 
  i doubt we have 10 million muslims , 10 million arabs though , possibly . 
  europa !, 
  europa !, 
  la la la la la la la. 
  i did n't say you had to shame people , but it does n't change the core of the issue , which is a lack of willpower . 
  hell , overeating is n't even the worst part , you can overeat and still be healthy , you just have to eat lots of fruits and veggies , and it 's honestly not much more effort to make tasty veggies . 
  alternatively ( or ideally both ) , you go exercise , do sports , dance , jog , whatever . 
  i was guilty of not doing that for quite a while , it 's really mostly a matter of getting off your ass . 
  i 'm not saying it is n't hard ( to start ) , but it 's not something that 's out of your hands/power and that you can just dismiss and blame on genes/depression/disease and say it ca n't be helped , that 's horseshit , and it 's not the case for the overwhelming majority of overweight people . 
  that 's not horrible though , it 's great :(, 
  it 's a mental illness if being lazy and not trying to improve is a mental illness . 
  yeah no , unless `` conversation '' means being able to spout 5 memorized short sentences the % for france is just bs . 
  guess most catholics missed the memo . 
  catholics in france nowadays seem to be too busy doing all they can to be intolerant towards homosexuality to do anything else . 
  such tolerance, 
  guess the us pres really has a long arm then . 
  why the fuck does this have upvotes ? 
  i love racist jokes when they 're funny , that 's just stupid as hell though . 
  ( also the pic looks shopped ), 
  many , many civil wars had foreign agents involved , often agent provocateurs or actual fighters , or providing weapons and information , this is hardly a new thing . 
  why is putting yourself/your people in danger the honorable thing to do ? 
  when you 're in the logic of a `` us vs them '' mentality , this makes no sense at all . 
  orrrr germany thinks that you should respect your contracts and does n't want to align itself in a `` us vs russia '' separation . 
  much false dichotomy . 
  how 's unemployement up there ? 
  i 'm guessing it 's not too bad . 
  says on the pic that she 's a tourist . 
  ny caps on girls are n't exactly commonplace here anyway . 
  nope , very illegal . 
  i beg to differ , my uni professors ( and tas ) were pretty much all amazing . 
  the secretaries and paperwork though ... * shivers *, 
  sounds colberty to me . 
  puritania for new european hymn !, 
  he 's a fun guy to be around though !, 
  what the fuck are you talking about ? 
  those posters are horribly unfunny . 
  i 'm all for political satire but really that 's the best they could come up with ? 
  tolerance,

   a new structure for the eu itself that much is true but i ca n't help but feel that the uk will just opt-out anything they vaguely do n't like like contributions to the eu budget . 
   with particular protections for the city of london . 
  here comes the corporate/finance world that want to avoid for example eu consumers protection laws & plan to `` lobby '' the uk conservative mps with tons of money to use it as an eu law haven ( like a tax haven in the eu but they do n't have to follow eu laws ) : / . 
   `` france and germany both want what they call ` the british problem ' to be settled well before they have elections . 
  as for france i 'd feel it 's less an election problem and more frequently not knowing whether the uk are in or out of the eu deal . 
  so the administration will welcome clarifications/uk decisions being settled and written down on paper for the time being . 
   no part of the ttip is about deregulation . 
  no , the us are a deregularization next to our own consumer protection law . 
  and the ttip wants us to `` re align '' with the us law ( by basically removing ours ) . 
  for example , we had banned a number of pesticid for being too toxic ( potentially toxic for the end consumer that will eat the fruit or for the environnement ) . 
  using ttip as an excuse us corporations tried to force us to remove pesticide related protection laws : http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/may/22/eu-dropped-pesticide-laws-due-to-us-pressure-over-ttip-documents-reveal unless you are saying that the guardian lied ? 
   the whole point is to save money and reduce trade barriers between two enormous blocs of people with largely the same values and interests . 
  that part is good , i agree . 
  however , if it was that simple it we would n't be offered thousands of pages of lawyery language with small fine prints hidden in it everywhere , sorry . 
   it 's pure demagogic hyperbole that has taken hold on the far right and far left in pushing all these competing narratives about the ttip being some sort of new world order . 
  no , it 's not a new world order . 
  but as martin shkreli or mosanto proved it times and times again , high level us corporate executive would rather let thousands die a slow agonizing death than pass a few more bucks in their own pockets . 
  so we need legal protection against that kind of shit . 
   it 's not all legalese . 
  ( ... ) just look at this , '' \u00a9 european union , 2015 reproduction is authorised provided the source is acknowledged '' are you trying to sell me our own paperworks ? 
  nice try . 
  that would be part of the `` dumbed down '' translation mandated by eu personnal for european people like you and me who do n't speak english legalese . 
   you can find publications that are as detailed ( or as abstract ) as you wish . 
  you know , when people try to make us sign papers thousands of pages long in a language we ca n't really understand it 's hard to shake entirely that feeling they 're trying to pull a fast one at some level . 
  the ttip is legitimate in itself , but a lot of people are definitely trying to push in scam-like clauses to make more money at any and all prices . 
  that 's what people are afraid of , and i 'm sorry it 's quite legitimate . 
   it 's completely unreasonable , because their fears are based on rumor , gossip , and their own ignorant preconceptions of what they think is going to happen well ; when people point what deregulation did for example to the us healthcare system then say they are afraid of the us trying to do the same here and on various subjects , i think it 's not * entirely * baseless . 
  like they wanted us to modify our patent system some time ago . 
  us patents trolls bullshit or martin shkreli anyone ? 
   they just regurgitate their own unfounded fears as if they 're the truth . 
  dismissing people as idiots because they do not fully understand thousands of page of legalese by professionnal rule lawyers in another language is maybe just a bit condescending on your part . 
   germans are insistent upon making ruinous economic decisions , lately . 
  erh . 
  i 'm probably one of the first to yell on the greek story , but there it 's probably gratuitous on your part . 
   `` what bothers me the most is that i do n't want all our consumer laws to be softened , '' oliver zloty told reuters tv . 
  `` and i do n't want to have a dictatorship by any companies . '', 
  so basically they 're afraid us corporations will force the eu to weaken and lower safety standards & laws under the excuse that it ~ ~ limits us corporate profit cashflow ~ ~ `` causes corporations to be uncompetitive '' . 
  it 's a quite reasonable motive to complain . 
  looks like hardliners did n't want want any cease fire and try throwing a wrench : / condoleances edit : from info appearing , it appears most of the victims are incidentally nearly all hdp or leftists . 
  ie political dissidents . 
  and apparently the whole thing was timed to blow up when selahattin demirta\u015f ( the hdp leader ) was passing by . 
  somebody wanted to kill kurdish friendly supporters & dissident politicians , that much is obvious . 
  people might blame the gov too quickly tho , it could be right wing turkish ultranationalists . 
  we know they played with explosives in bangkok ( ... & europe ) recently too . 
  i hate to say it . 
  but it seems he 's right . 
  seems like a good compromise, 
   the group also suggests that alcohol should not be served at corporate events in case it upsets members of certain faiths . 
  what ? 
  hahahah lol no . 
  the politically correct police needs to stop here , really . 
  btw , let 's not ignore due process in the name of `` going faster than silly things like laws '' thank you . 
  it 's a lot faster than people can think in that kind of case . 
  we can easily track who cross the russian border , and the `` refugees '' that speak russian enough can be sent back immediately already . 
  edit btw , let 's not ignore due process in the name of `` going faster than silly things like laws '' thank you . 
   police in northern norway have confirmed that many of the syrian refugees streaming over the norwegian-russian border hold legal residence permission in russia and have lived there for several years . 
  before anyone cries foul , they 're talking about people living in russia for years and that are already integrated somewhere and just doing benefit shopping on top of it . 
  no reasons to accept it . 
   and migrants are just people who generally enter state on legitimate visas for purposes of living and working . 
  legitimate or not . 
  hence the famously known illegal immigration . 
  people crossing the mediterranean in boats generally do n't have any visas ( or they 'd have simply took the plane ) . 
  well . 
  to answer the title , here 's how i 'd understand it : - an asylum seeker is somebody fleeing war & persecution or similar , and asking for official refugee statut & help in a foreign country . 
  - a refugee is somebody fleeing generally war & persecution . 
  not all refugees are asylum seekers ; some ( lots ) are illegals . 
  - immigrants are people generally not fleeing war or persecution , but looking for better economic conditions for themselves , generally fleeing a very poor country . 
  currently that category should be turned back to help curtain the flow of people coming in europe . 
  basically muslims applying modern western ways to the practice of islam in europe . 
  good !, 
  ... refusing ... free money . 
  okay , that 's a new one . 
  ... please arrest & deport that mental case ? 
  or at least close him in a psychiatric unit ffs . 
  that 's very generous of them , 
  that has nothing to do with it , and is certainly not a justification to attack other people . 
  well , seeing how we are facing a numbers crisis ; good implementation . 
  germany 's doing it right again !, 
   later that day the two groups of albanian and pakistani guys continue to fight each other for hours . 
  looks like 1 \u00b0 ) they do n't come from warzone 2 \u00b0 ) are an issue to social peace . 
  i 'd almost suggest putting a `` 3 strikes '' policy : when caught 3 times doing stupid infractions like this within a few month of coming in , systematic deportation . 
   no one was arrested , well , that is a problem, 
   on the other hand , we get really good highways in france . 
  built on state money and state work , not by companies . 
  the companies came later and decided it was their 's by bribing the gov into giving them away and started immediately collect tolls to use the highway ( then asked the gov to pay to maintain them itself , just to complete the scam ) . 
  there have been admittedly `` reajustments '' and modifications on the agreement lately . 
  well ; it 's germany 's problem ; but selling infra for a penny looks like a bad solution lately . 
  then they constantly clamor for subsidies and constantly try to rise up the road crossing toll, 
  refusing repeatedly to identify yourself on religious grounds while handling administrative ( ie legal ) paperwork despite being prompted by the cops then likely insulting them likely resulted in that sentance that said 30 000 is probably a bit high ( unless she 's rich , i vaguely suspect they might probably shave a 0 from it if she appeals ) maybe she tried to be a `` victim '' and the judge tossed the book at her ?
