  what western or northern european government will refuse refugee status to someone who says `` i 'm fleeing the war in syria and , unfortunately , i lost my papers somewhere along my torturous journey ... '', 
  hungary is n't safe !, 
  quick , all hungarians flee to the uk !, 
  send us a half dozen more , for free !, 
  we 'll put them to good use !, 
   greece satisfies that requirement . 
  no no no , we 're currently having a , um , class war . 
  please help these migrants that feel unsafe in our country . 
  cross , or close ? 
  brilliant idea . 
  eastern thrace , here we come !, 
  and this time we 'll know where to stop . 
  land wars in asia have n't exactly gone well for us recently . 
  then skopje will do the same thing , and we 'll be left with all of them . 
  we ca n't clean up the islands , it 's just not possible . 
  we ca n't close our borders . 
  we 're so fucked . 
  counterpoint , though - they 're actually forced to integrate . 
  they now have to be productive members of society and learn the language . 
  they ca n't just get lost in the bureaucratic shuffle of large cities , they ca n't start muslim-only schools and they ca n't try and enforce sharia in their insulated communities . 
  while i 'm sure it will be very hard for them at first it will end up better for the country as a whole . 
  the children will surely grow up much more invested in their new country when they 're forced to learn the language and go to a school full of local kids that they 've grown up with . 
  they 'll have similar aspirations to their new friends , and they 'll really earn their place in society . 
   they should 've beefed up the borders and deported the shit out of the immigrants . 
  easier said than done . 
  please tell me how we can beef up the thousands of islands we have ? 
  how italy and spain can beef up their massive coastlines ? 
  this is n't something we can do alone . 
  we need help . 
  we do n't want them coming into greece but we just ca n't stop them . 
  we 've been failing at it for many years now . 
  it 's only now that western and northern europe are seeing what is happening . 
   as a gesture of gratitude , they went on an instant hunger strike . 
  and they demanded to be sent back to malmo , right ? 
  that the town they were sent to was n't good enough ? 
  alright . 
  i 'll start , you can pick up halfway through on friday . 
  i feel that we 've sold ourselves short . 
  like typical , lazy greeks we cut it down from its original length of 158 stanzas to just 2 just so we can leave official events early to go drink coffee in the square . 
  i , personally , am standing up to this travesty . 
  i sing all 158 stanzas every time i heard the anthem . 
   and some other countries . 
  some other countries are actually having issues already and it 's clear it will only get worse . 
   for a terror organisation like isis it 's much easier to fake some papers and fly into germany with an airplane than taking the long road throgh the other european states and apply for asylum . '', 
  i think the issue is n't with people that are * already * jihadis , but those that will turn to it after they get increasingly more radicalized in their insulated communities . 
  look at second and third generation jihadis from marseilles , london , copenhagen , and munich that have gone back to the middle east to fight for isis . 
  it 's only a matter of time before isis , or whoever replaces them , decides that europe should be their focus . 
  if isis ever manages to carve themselves a stable state then they 'll turn their attention to europe , surely . 
  we already know they have thousands of people across the continent ready and willing to travel and fight for them there - it does n't take a wild imagination to see even more people willing to fight for them in their new , adopted homes . 
  nothing wrong with albania . 
  most of those albanians making it to sweden , denmark , and finland are leaving greece because of the crisis . 
  i used to have a lot of albanian buddies in my town . 
  they 're almost all gone , now , except for a few with good , steady jobs . 
  almost all of them went to sweden , with a couple to finland . 
  oh , yeah , of course . 
  those isis guys are n't doing anything at all . 
  they 're just peacefully coexisting with the other factions in syria . 
  and eastern thrace used to be almost all greeks , now there are none . 
  the population exchange moved so many greeks out of eastern thrace and so few turks back that every village and town have many abandoned houses . 
  it sucks , and it 's unfortunate that we all got caught up in this . 
  the people that now live in my families ' villages are some of the nicest people i 've ever met . 
  they have absolutely nothing but are willing to do anything to make us feel welcome . 
  james blunt - the hero of the balkans . 
  originally the issue had to do with the irredentist claims - tito wanted northern greece . 
  he wanted my city , thessaloniki , so he could have a southern port . 
  while the real claims may be gone skopjans have grown up thinking greek macedonia is their birthright , and that the people in greek macedonia are being oppressed by the greek state ( which is n't true in the slightest ) . 
  for me not really . 
  i 'm macedonian , and it 's not the land of my people . 
  does that make sense ? 
  i would personally have no qualms with a regional qualifier at all but , and from many comments in this thread this seems an `` outdated '' idea , i think a name giving them seemingly sole `` ownership '' of the macedonian identity is unfair . 
  some 85 % of the region is in greece , though . 
  which is why northern macedonia would be much more appropriate . 
  so much of their national identity is wrapped up in ancient macedonia . 
  there are statues of alexander and philip everywhere , with streets and airports named after them as well . 
  imagine if kaliningrad broke off from russia and named themselves warmian-masurian , and said one of your countries biggest national heroes is actually from there ( when all evidence points to the contrary ) . 
  at best , it 's frustrating . 
  at worst , it 's irredentist . 
  if they dropped claims to greek macedonia then why do their politicians still speak in front of maps showing half of northern greece as part of greater macedonia , and why do they place their flag on top of mount olympus ? 
  let 's just glass everywhere there is someone named muhammed , just to be safe . 
  yes , i mean everywhere . 
  those are five beautiful ships you 've got there, 
  those damn immigrants, 
  one on island and in western thrace , near the border with turkey . 
  the reason i mention the border with turkey in thrace is because that 's a massive area for drugs smuggling ( especially heroin ) . 
  a few camps at that border that is now basically vacant and you 'll hopefully have an impact on the drug trade as well . 
  we invented it , we can handle it, 
  why ? 
  it floats . 
  that 's all you need a ship to do for it to be a good ship . 
  no , our cities went underwater when our loans did . 
  it 's an obvious joke , and a pretty funny one . 
  no need to get upset and insult people . 
  one of the issues is how we 're all looking at how much debt greece has . 
  we 're looking at it like it 'll all come due at once and it wo n't . 
  these are long term loans . 
  if greece can pay back the installments things should be okay . 
  to help greece pay the installments the terms should be renegotiated to a level where greece will pay . 
  all parties lose of greece goes bankrupt . 
  uhh ... germany has such healthy industry now in part because the ailing euro countries are keeping the euro down . 
  germany is killing it with their exports .

  i really liked [ joanna lumley 's greek odyssey ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5ysekbyfwg ) she went beyond just the islands and showed some places in the mountains i had never seen . 
  awesomeness , love it !, 
  i love adriano celentano !, 
  i remember i watched him in that film where he was some sort of wild child found in the jungle . 
  it was probably crap but i loved it as a kid . 
  i went to france for a semester with the erasmus programme . 
  i spoke the language and it was generally ok . to be honest , i did n't like france very much . 
  i tried and there were a lot of nice people but overall i felt very excluded and people were rude . 
  it was much worse with some of the americans who were there , they would get outright hostility . 
  i also encountered some racism because i 'm olive skinned and people would assume i am algerian and be abusive to me . 
  in all , it was an experience that i was happy to have but france is not a country where i would like to return . 
  i was so happy when i was on the way to the airport that i tipped the taxi driver . 
  guy could n't believe it . 
  is n't a course called `` philosophy '' taught in high school ( \u039b\u03cd\u03ba\u03b5\u03b9\u03bf ) ; i sure remember it but i graduated back in the ice age and it may not exist anymore . 
  is that really the theory , that it is how people sounded before the indo europeans ? 
  that 's pretty cool !, 
  i 've also read a theory that the basques are descended from neanderthals ( it made it sound like a good thing ! ), 
  as well as about the fact that it is really strange that they have a very large incidence of rh negative blood and it may have in fact originated there . 
  since i have rh neg blood not sure if that makes me part basque and part neanderthal too ... 
  interesting , i only know alors on danse ( of course ) so i 'll have to check out more stuff from him . 
  i would n't say he reminds me much of brel in any way . 
  i was in kos last year and there were a bunch of very drunk , very fit teenage and early 20s dutchies going around . 
  they were kinda cute , actually , never bothered me . 
  i was just amused that they were so drunk they were hitting on 30 something , pregnant me walking back to the hotel . 
  i would return round midnight or 1 too tired to stay out later and they would already be so incredibly drunk !, 
  but there was no fighting , sex in the streets or any of that , i would n't say they were acting like the brits we get . 
  he did n't know what true greek feta tastes like until he came to greece . 
  it just about killed him . 
  i could never choose just one . 
  i like english because it 's great for communication and i think it 's amazing that it has such a huge vocabulary . 
  french is beautiful and i love that i learnt french if only because i understand jacques brel songs and he was a genius . 
  i loooove the sound of italian and italian songs . 
  spanish is nice but the way it is spoken in spain it does sound like people have a speech impediment . 
  love german because it is so freaking precise and now that i 'm learning norwegian i see that it is a common trait in germanic languages . 
  do n't think that either language sounds particularly nice , though . 
  and from when i was learning turkish i fell in love with the grammar and the whole completely different structure of the language but holy crap it sounds terrible . 
  really ugly . 
  the one with the aliens stood very well with google translate . 
  good one , i think i 've heard it in greek too . 
  there are some people who do n't have a nameday because they have ancient greek names or they are named after flowers or plants etc. 
  in that case they either celebrate at `` all saint 's day '' or they are given a middle name which is christian and they can celebrate during that day . 
  in a way though you are right about there being a static and finite pool of names . 
  the standard thing is for people to name kids after their parents ( the kid 's grandparents ) so the same names are recycled over and over . 
  in highschool in a class of 30 students there would be 5 boys named giorgos , 4 girls named maria and so on . 
  yeah , stupid google translate mangled the punchline ... 
  in all countries hell is pretty standard , they put them in shit and they hit them with whips . 
  so he goes to the greek hell and the guy who greets him is just fine . 
  he asks how come so the greek guy says : `` well , you know , this is greek hell , sometimes they run out of shit , sometimes the whips break ... '', 
  omg `` shut up , you 're next ! '', 
  i love it !, 
   what i find particularly amusing is to listen to foreigners that have learned greek in crete speak it with a cretan accent . 
  while in france i met a couple of belgians who had been vacationing in crete every summer.they came up to me and said '' \u038a\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1 \u03ba\u03ac\u03bc\u03b5\u03b9\u03c2 ; '' i nearly peed myself laughing . 
  i make a crazy good tirokafteri and i 'm with a man who ca n't stand feta . 
  is n't that ironic , do n't you think ? 
   complimentary stuff ( like uzo ) right after or before meals , might just be a tourist thing it is not just a tourist thing . 
  it is done in many restaurants and other places throughout greece during all seasons . 
  it seems like such a random greek figure to know about . 
  how did you learn about her , if you do n't mind me asking ? 
  it 's common in greece too . 
  i do n't drive an ambulance so do n't know if it goes as smoothly always but i sure do my best to get out of the way asap if i hear one . 
  cool video . 
  i 'm going with a greek eu joke . 
  so you think that greece has an inferiority complex compared to turkey ? 
  because i 've always thought that we have a superiority complex myself . 
  i 've heard that the greek/turkish debacle was created during the dictatorship of 1967 to 1974 . 
  until then everybody here called it turkish too . 
  then they mounted a huge campaign saying `` we 're greeks and our coffee is greek '' or some such shit . 
  really surprised here too . 
  he 's seen her on the old [ 50 drachma bill ] ( http://img144.imageshack.us/img144/4189/50aob1.png ) ? 
  is he a fan of mimi denisi ? 
  i 've got nothing . 
  oh , yeah , `` forgotten and left to rot '' totally describes santorini . 
  my in laws are foreign . 
  last year we were on holiday in kos and practically no one was issuing receipts . 
  i was really upset and getting into fights pretty much the entire time . 
  this year in naxos i would say that about 80 % or more of the places we went to were giving receipts . 
  except for that crappy , overpriced spanish restaurant called anda jaleo where they gave us a fake receipt and i did n't realise until we were gone . 
  sooo angry at that one , our bill had been 270 eur or so . 
  athens : democracy, 
  i need a throwaway for this one , will get back to you . 
  their language sounds like klingon . 
  we had quite the dress code . 
  girls : nothing above the knee , no exposed shoulders ( short sleeves were fine ) not a lot of makeup , no excessive jewelry . 
  boys : no long hair , nothing longer than a beatle in the early 60s and even that could get you in trouble . 
  no short shorts . 
  now that was my school in the early 90s and in a very conservative area . 
  i think that rules in other schools were a lot more relaxed . 
  what about it ? 
  dubrovnik looks gorgeous , i 'd love to visit someday . 
  my boyfriend 's brother went for a holiday he said it was nice , he was just perplexed with the music choices wherever they went there was music from the 90s . 
  roxette were a particular favourite . 
  was on the german side in wwii . 
  seems to have emerged from the yugoslavian conflict pretty much unscathed . 
  cool flag, 
  they still have majority in parliament so they can pass laws but it is a very small majority . 
  i do n't know when but i do expect to have elections again fairly soon . 
  the democratic left withdrew from the governing coalition and as a result the socialist party ended up with more ministers which replaced the democratic left ministers . 
  the two parties now governing , new democracy and pasok ( socialist party ) have been fighting over a nd mp saying that pasok screwed up the country in the 80s and it is to blame for the crisis now . 
  btw the dude who said all that used to belong in the youth of epen which was a party aligned with the dictatorship in greece and there are pictures of him from those times out hunting communists with an axe . 
  starting on monday there will be new laws to crack down on people riding free on buses .

  we have a recognised muslim minority in greece , and have multiple mosques . 
  we coexist pretty well i would guess , since we wouldnt want to * really * harm our relationship with turkey . 
  they are treated specially , with special seats assigned to them in the parliament , special tests for afterschool education etc. 
  i think that this was done many years ago , and it is like this because in older times , christians might have not been the politest about the muslims : x. also , i dont see the situation changing ( for better or worse ) , because we christians seem to like to forget that they exist ( in a good way ) . 
  though i cant say that i dont care what the germans want , i can for sure say that they are not informed enough on the matter to have a credible opinion , so i think this survey is a little bit overrated . 
  hello there, 
  there is no way this thread can be that peaceful, 
  you are being unfair, 
  there you go, 
   some euro bills are uncomfortably large if you reach the amounts that get you to have that problem , you are fine m8 . 
  i think we are on a different page , boss, 
  no no , you are the pope in this . 
  what would lithuania gain from kaliningrad anyway ? 
  clauzelian reformation any second now ? 
   older ladies often say that a plump kid is a healthy kid we used to have that in greece with mothers in the occupation years in ww2 . 
  we call it `` occupational syndrome '' . 
  basically mothers ( and grandmothers ) feeding their kids all they can even sometimes resulting in kid obesity . 
  rofl grow up, 
  good way making the young not get married and have kids if they plan to emigrate ( assuming they * believe * him ) edit : btw i am just taking him seriously just to amuse it little bit, 
  paying our taxxes like the danish, 
  i bet she uses chrome . 
  what a pleb, 
  so we agree that pitchforking should be the plan b ? 
  on the sidebar above the mods it says `` message the moderators '' , you basically send a message to all the mods . 
  i dont diagree with what the poster claims at all . 
  i agree that the removals have been unfair . 
  but , why would he not try to message the mods for that ? 
  i think you are too harsh . 
  you can message the mods for it . 
  no reason to pitchfork . 
  also , this is probably one mod doing it without the other 's knowing it . 
  with your approach there is the danger of the mod getting defensive . 
  the uneducated/cant-speak-a - second-language/religious/conservative vote is way easier and standard to go for . 
  so , not in this millenium . 
  our tv certainely makes it look like one . 
  honestly , i havent heard of a case where we invade your airspace, 
  yeah basically in percentages ( both population and gdp ) we spent more , but in raw numbers you overwhelm us , that 's why you get to be the bully . 
  in greece it is ( used to ? ), 
  16 % of the gdp , yet employing a big part of th population . 
  and a lot of subsidies come from eu , so a lot of communities would be dead if subsidies were stopped . 
  didnt want it anyway, 
  turks . 
  'cause that 's how it has always been : /, 
   ( although tourists can be irritating ) fucking tourists man . 
  an englishman would understand , 
  dat north italy, 
  oh god . 
  you are like ... so cool dude, 
  strongly worded letter in on the way boys !, 
   what have we done to deserve him voted for him : /, 
  damn , it looks so accurate considering the time bismark lived, 
  who ? 
  to the extremism in general . 
  uncertainety and insecurity does that, 
  is that a reference to ww1 ? 
  you are right and i actually saw it coming . 
  well , there goes me trying to ask in the most polite manner i could . 
  can i ask you something else . 
  what exactly in my comment made it so people think that im a homophobe ? 
  i was always legit curious about the thouggt behind parades, 
  it said modern statehood . 
  which is vague as fuck . 
  can you tell me what you understood from that ? 
  sounds reasonable . 
  follow up question ( if you dont mind ) . 
  so basically the parade 's target is to change what people think about the people parading ? 
  what about something recent ? 
  why do people do parades for things like that ? 
  i mean , i dont give a fuck if you are gay or whatever , but why parade ? 
  \\  modern statehood \\  uk elaborate please . 
  what are baby boomers ? 
  it 's okay guys . 
  we got primary surplus to invest in broken german submarines now . 
  went there , it was a blast !, 
  my mistake then . 
  thanks for the correction . 
  it is in 2012 so i guess the decline should be about 20 % ? 
  nutella is too bitter . 
  watch out , you might be banned ... 
  a mod will ask you for source, 
  what a miracle ... 
  he literally started learning to write serbian ... i think we have the original neckbeard caricature here ... 
  his last name sounds like the emperor justinian ( \u03b9\u03bf\u03c5\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03bd\u03b9\u03b1\u03bd\u03cc\u03c2 ) , but italicised, 
  that 's because this empire didnt really face middle ages as harsh as the west for the general population . 
  the people in the city were held in high regard for some reason back then . 
  he probably just wanted to make them his . 
  they called the emperor tsar because tsar means ceasar . 
  and they use the suffix grad in many cities . 
  fair enough . 
  even by sheer number of populations it is no contest, 
   the protestants have better militaries , anyway . 
  they do ? 
  every generation blames the previous one though . 
  so i got 50 % . 
  i am calling it a day . 
  how much percentage do they hold ? 
  yes you are a lazy genious born in le wrong generation , 
  we are not lazy , we are just really inefficient . 
  i got 15 years old to be able to tell the difference haha :p, 
  no shit,

  turkey is too strong and aggressive to match without allies . 
  greeks know that without european standards they would return to their old habits of `` partycracy '' ( domination of the currently governing party ) and corruption , which led us to our current nadir . 
  much of debt will not be erased that easily . 
  whenever a radical change happens ( bankruptcy , occupation , communism comes , communism leaves , * the current neoliberal programme * ) people die and people are relieved from their debts without deserving it , or they make fortunes , again without deserving it . 
  i am against radical changes and most sensible people agree . 
  there is the very real risk that during the next couple years the social and political unrest will reach very high if tsipras is severely wounded . 
  everything , everything is possible from a point on . 
  the harsh austerity for 8th year , leading to a total of 10 years of recession , is a dumb strategy and i hope i am proven wrong . 
  the worst days were the years of the ongoing crisis for a variety of reasons ( nazis in the streets , afraid to talk openly because samaras is watching you , tv turned into a sponsored terrorist , lack of perspective for the ordinary people ) and the crisis is still going on . 
  not that i liked the years before , and not that i will like the years after , once our inequality numbers will go beyond european standards and enter sub-saharan africa ranges . 
  at least i hope that corruption is killed . 
  this alone is worth all the fuss . 
  if syriza collapses and we head to elections , it is possible that people will vote for the nazis or the communists , which are both hardcore anti-eu . 
  this would be a nightmare scenario . 
  eu should n't have applied such pressure , they should have accepted the umbrella for the poors without asterisks . 
  a coalition of syriza with any party other than perhaps their current allies would bury forever the dream to clean greece from corruption . 
  in other words , some people do n't know when they have won enough . 
  weeks before capital controls , popular newspapers in greece had titles such as `` from syriza control to capital control '' . 
  people were discussing it and journalists naturally asked the finmin , the pm and any other minister and various members of parliament . 
  say i am a journalist and i ask schaeuble the same question . 
  he answers `` capital controls is out of the question '' when obviously he himself has prepared such plans , like he was trained in the university , and he reguralry runs some tests . 
  does this make him a liar ? 
  i am not into economics but i know that a banking system with leveraging has 2 stable points , and one is the bank run state . 
  it is like a chemical reaction , say burning wood . 
  wood is stable but it takes a spark and it becomes co2 . 
  all those bank safety measures like ela serve like water spraying on wood when a spark is expected . 
  you do n't need your finmin to add the spark , this would be a crime . 
  it is already pretty irrational to keep money in greek banks but many of us do so because either we have no other option or because we love our country . 
  say a journalist asks vman `` am i sensible to keep money in greek banks ? '' . 
  what should he say ? 
  ok , point me another politician who you trust and who has not radiated lies . 
  do you know that greece has an emergency plan to invade romania ? 
  and i bet romania has such a plan as well . 
  will anyone admit it ? 
  you are telling me that a minister of finance should openly warn for capital controls months ago ? 
  where would this lead to , other than a good ol' bank run ? 
  sorry , your comment is wrong , we are talking real politics here and not populist propaganda . 
  if merkel told tsipras to not pass any laws that would serve the cause , would show good will , shorten the schedule and improve greece 's image in other european voting pools and parliaments ( improving the odds for a deal ) and then accused him of inactivity , this is a real political issue . 
  the correct course of action is n't to call 5 whole countries piigs . 
  it started badly , it continued badly . 
  and yes , the term `` terrorists '' was indeed used by greeks , but the term has its own meaning since ages : terrorism is the use of terror in order to gain power , simple as that . 
  it does n't necessarily mean guerilla wars , the modern meaning was promoted by usa predominantly but not everyone endorse this interpretation . 
  [ eu as a whole ] ( http://trade.ec.europa.eu/doclib/docs/2006/september/tradoc_122532.pdf ) has like 40 % more exports than usa , while they both have roughly equal gdp . 
  a small country with many close neighbours has more trade . 
  if you divided usa into states and you compared california with spain , for example , you would see higher percentages . 
  the emphatic difference you mention between an average european country and usa has its reasons , although you are right that usa lacks in exports more than it should based on geographical reasons only . 
  the way you say it appears fair and right . 
  but what if i tell you that the electricity company is valued at less that the cost of a mere power station currently under construction ? 
  now you see the problem . 
  the idea that lately came out was to transfer the assets to a company in luxemburg which has schaeuble as its manager and gabriel as its assistant manager . 
  weird , is n't it ? 
  politicians are to be blamed for part of this lack of eagerness to reach a consensus . 
  germans , dutch and other politicians accusing greeks , portuguese and others ( the infamous and utterly stupid piigs argument ) but greeks and others spontaneously added gasoline to the fire of mistrust . 
  now it keeps appearing harder and harder to reach a consensus no matter what efforts are made by whichever side . 
  this should serve as an example in the future , to not play with the emotions of the people and to respect the feelings of other europeans as well . 
  and this is true not only for greeks but for germans and british and everyone . 
  how to persuade germans to support greece after all those collisions ? 
  how to persuade greeks to accept after all this humiliation ? 
  how does an unbiased average european feel about this thing ? 
  they all crossed the lines . 
  i am not sure that the dream ends . 
  not even if we greeks leave . 
  europeans vary greatly in their mentality but i guarantee you that a great variation in mentality exists within greece as well with crete being the champion of tax evasion . 
  this did not interrupt our peace . 
  europe is the best place in the world , we show more respect for the different , for human rights and freedom of expression and we maintain peace . 
  throughout all those years there has been no coup or war in any eu country ( and no bankruptcy either , at least not a blatant one ) . 
  all europeans feel strange for the lack of sovereignity and so they tend to endorse politicians who villainise others . 
  i do n't pay attention to such nonsense , it is the usual populistic crap that will forever accompany democracy and freedom of speech . 
  i have friends from germany and elsewhere , sure we differ in mentality but heck i do n't quite match the average greek either and i find this not necessarily a bad thing . 
  europe progressed through variety and it should keep this . 
  i dislike the rather uniform and colorless usa federation and i certainly dislike the huge chinese state . 
  the current crisis is the first crisis that europe faced and it coincided with the global financial crisis . 
  europe managed to face it adequately ( remember how close italy was from being left outside the markets during 2011 ) and now the greek problem is the major stake . 
  it is true that greece has been devastated by 7 years of recession ( and more to come ) and that it is not the only country that suffers today ( portugal and spain are not exactly happy ) but it keeps going , it faces the rising economic powers adequately , it keeps peace , it has a balanced overal trade balance and by all measures it appears like an oasis in a world in turmoil . 
  the darkest moment of europe was its role in the ukraine crisis . 
  it has had other dark moments , one of which is the current dominance of conservatives with their monotonous rhetoric about the virtues of a levelling austerity , but i see it as the efforts of a teenager who tries to become an adult . 
  we ca n't stick to the stubborness of germans for an austerity that happened to work for them ( because they applied it correctly ) because in the future all we now see as the permanent truth will be past . 
  europe has no other choice than to overcome its first crisis ( although to abandon civil rights like in the case of the imposed punishment on greece rightfully appears like a good leap backwards , but anyway i insist on being optimistic , if not for greeks then for the rest of europeans ) . 
  greeks always tend to not pay taxes when they are n't very fond of the governing party or the policy , i remember the attitude during 2011-2012 . 
  this is a stupid attitude because what you pay today is returned to your children tomorrow ... with a haircut because of corruption . 
  the saying you mention is unknown to me ; it probably originated during ww2 occupation . 
  i really ca n't see the context . 
  the poor greeks pay enough , but the rich ones not , and many of the intermediate ones are champions in tax evasion . 
  this situation increases inequality and decreases meritocracy and it is a time bomb for greek society . 
  it is true that horizontal taxes proposed by eu will further increase inequality but the current situation is non sustainable and if we do n't fix certain open wounds in greece we have no future . 
  your attitude is not flattering for greeks . 
  i wo n't align with you , we are not all the same . 
  today all eu are bullying greece but it is impossible to not see that the root for our problems is ourselves and our tolerance for so many years of lousy politics . 
  i ca n't answer you completely because i do n't know . 
  germany and france love to sell weapons to greece grossly overpriced or faulty ( or both ) . 
  quite some greeks live off the illegal payments when they pretend they do n't see how our suppliers screw us . 
  turkey is there as well . 
  greek navy operates in indian ocean fighting piracy . 
  just off my head , not sure what are the most critical reasons . 
  potami is totally unreliable . 
  it claims it is center-left but in fact it is the same as pasok was during 1997-2004 ( economically right-wing ) . 
  its members come from various wavelengths of the political spectrum and various parties and they prefer to parade in the most neoliberal tv channel in greece . 
  they were promoted by germany and this tells a lot . 
  the best possible ally for syriza happens to be a bad ally : kammenos is known for his weirdness and he loves low-level corruption and intrigues . 
  i dislike this party but what to do ?

  well , it 's a license to print money . 
  read on ; further down she mentions direct ecb funding of states . 
  that 's what usually happens when banks offer 5 % interest on deposits that wo n't get converted to drachmas . 
  their salary is lower than what they 'd like - just as with everyone else 's :-) . 
  you 'll find most of europe more laid-back w.r.t. 
  religion than the u.s. 
  here : http://www.eurail.com/home - essentially a prepaid unlimited pass for a specific number of countries . 
  as far as i know , you can get a tourist visa easily , it is valid for 90 days for the whole eu . 
  so , with an eurail pass and a visa you can travel wherever you want . 
  i 'd also suggest looking into couchsurfing , but for your age it would probably be easier if you were n't alone . 
  usually , yes . 
  right now , they are so risk-averse they are deleveraging like crazy , as long as they do n't incur any losses . 
  that 50 % was the nominal amount . 
  the bonds were traded at 20-30 % of their face value the days before the haircut , and several bond owners made good money by buying them and holding on . 
  yeah , it should be grexodus . 
  ( [ semi-relevant link ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/third_siege_of_missolonghi ) ), 
  otoh , it also points to a way out : fire people and decrease bureocracy at the same time . 
  if f.e. 
  10 % of office workers were let go , i guarantee you that  90 % of them woud be dead wood ( why ? 
  because everyone knows who the suckers are that do most of the work , and middle managers are horrified that they are left without any of them ) . 
  however , firing people is a political suicide move , not to mention that it would be quite costly ( compensations , jobless claims , legal objections ) , and the newly-unemployed will be for all intents end purposed unemployable right now . 
  keep in mind that bureocracy is the prime driver of graft and corruption in greece : the more people you ( a private person ) interact with , the more opportunities for bribes exist . 
  funnily enough , the greek irs is one of the few institutions that have strenously resisted their inclusion into the the \u039a\u0395\u03a0s ( citizen service centers , one-stop-shops for interaction with the greek state apparatus ; my experiences there have been excellent so far , but they are routinely under-staffed and under-funded ) . 
  gah , i 'm ranting , and i have work to do ... 
  no , these measures were in place at least since ' 96 , when i ground up against them from the private contractor side . 
  do n't get me started on post-2 .5 k expenses ( if you want to buy f.e. 
  a server that costs 3keur , one needs to perform a public bid -- gah , see , i started ... ) bureocracy is like a gas : if you add people , the same amount of work expands to accomodate them . 
  what the situation shows is that institutions have an utter and complete lack of trust in people , which they expect would cheat and steal at the very first opportunity ; in the institution 's view , the only way to prevent that is to share the responsibility among as many people as possible . 
  just to position myself , i 'm currently a public worker in a greek university ( done about as much time in the private sector as in the public ) , and from what i 've seen the problem is partly that the public sector has historically been a method of removing the incompetent from the work force . 
  granted , every office in a public institution has someone that is 3-4 times as productive as the mean , but that just means the rest do n't feel they have to work as hard . 
  consider also the fact that excessive bureaucracy is ridiculously rampant : if i need to buy f.e. 
  toner for the copy machine , i will need to obtain 4 signatures ( a tenured professor , sector head , department head , department accountant ) then the vice-rector has to sign off on this expense , i get to buy the item on credit , then for the actual payment i need another 5 signatures ( tenured professor , sector head , 3 witnesses that i 've received the item in good condition ) ; after this point i do n't know what happens , but i think it needs another 2-3 signatures by the uni 's accounting department . 
  i also do n't see how a workforce that is more that 40 years old can become more efficient , when they actively resist learning new skills . 
  yes , we have secretaries that do n't know and do n't want to use a computer . 
  ( there is still hope : one secretary i know learned to use a computer and got one assigned to her because she ( unofficially ) wanted to use facebook . ), 
  i do n't think there 's been enough shock to rattle these people out of their comfortable rut ... 
  does n't matter . 
  they might as well be located in israel , germany or russia - everywhere the bandwidth and hosting is cheap . 
  nobody uses satellites for ip traffic , the earth-orbit-earth latency is crippling ( not to mention the bandwidth scarce ) . 
  huh ? 
  i might be wrong , but i was under the impression that germany had a self-imposed wage freeze for the last 10 years or so ; thus enabling exports , making more money for the corps , while keeping unemployment down ( even if it 's part-time trainees ) . 
  oh , did you know that germany already had billions of profits due to the crisis ? 
  how , you ask ? 
  people are throwing euros at the german bonds , to the effect that yields are now below inflation - people are paying the germans to hold onto their cash . 
  and that 's just the bond market . 
  do n't get me started on the value of the euro ... 
   those that were not affected as much by the crisis also , rural areas where the only crisis was the fuel cost - they already live on 200-300 euro pensions , and nd still has lots of clientelist connections ... 
  a good analysis , but there have been unofficial noises from all three organizations that there may be some leeway w.r.t. 
  the greek program . 
  it 's worse when you consider that men have 12 months of mandatory military service during which they are not considered unemployed , despite getting ~ 3 euro/month . 
  also , greece has too many students , which also do n't cont for unemployment statistics . 
  eternal september . 
  look it up . 
  i 've been there too . . 
  in greece 30 euros gives you 24/1 and a landline number with per-minute charges . 
  it 's possible to get lower than that . 
  ouch - that 's what happens when i multitask ... fixed . 
  [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/uphsi/embarrassing_scenes_from_golden_dawn_it_seems/ ) is a the video clip of the altercation , along with a translation of the going-ons . 
  semi-relevant : this reminds me of a [ speech by chomsky ] ( http://chomsky.info/talks/19960413.htm ) , which has the same tone : '' [ taxes ] are fine for you , but not for me '' ( he said free market , but it applies to taxes too ) . 
  actually , it 's 45.2 in 2006 . 
  afterwards the costs go ballistic , mostly because of the rising cost of servicing the debt . 
  in 2009 , it was 53.8 % . 
  and the 9.1 % deficit ? 
  greece has now primary surplus , and the whole deficit goes to paying off the debt . 
  note that naurgul also talks about * primary * expenditures - that is , everything but debt repayments . 
  that 's what 's happening right now . 
  oh , and it is n't working . 
  money in the economy is like oil in a car engine . 
  you ca n't have either too much or too little . 
  what has happened the last years is that the total number of euros in greece has dwindled to a degree that the economy is seizing up . 
  i do n't support political brinksmanship - but the polls show that that 's what many greeks want ... 
   they fail to mention what are negotiating with tbh i think we 're near the point were we 're holding the gun to our own head and are asking for a delay in payments - or we 're going to make a mess of the living room ... 
  no-one believes that we 're past the end of cuts . 
  the problem seems to be that most people do n't see an end to them either . 
  i do n't think the new 10 % of voters that made syriza the 2nd party expect tsipras to be the savior of greece , vanquisher of germans and harbinger of the rise of greece . 
  they just saw that the two major parties , when asked by the eu/ecb/imf to jump , asked ` how high ? '' . 
  while this might be in reality a failure of pasok/nd to communicate with the populace , it 's still a failure . 
  tsipras is seen as wanting to negotiate harder , but nobody expects him to do 100 % of his pronouncements ( yeah , we 're a cynical bunch , us greeks ) , perly because we know he will not have enough votes to form a standalone government . 
  it 's a classical euphemism . 
  you know , like pacific ocean , cape of good hope ... 
  actually , greeks * will * vote again , as the coalition talks have failed ; we will know tomorrow the date of the next elections , most probably june 17th . 
  and from the inside , i see the democratic process in full swing ; the percentages the new parties got in the parliament are indicative of the greeeks having lost faith in the old parties ( nd / pasok ) , not democracy itself . 
  while abstention was high ( ~ 34 % ) , it 's caused more by rising transportation costs than unwillingness to vote ( due to familial ties , greeks moving to the cities are encouraged to * not * move their voting districts to where they live , long story ) - if you need to move from athens to the periphery to vote you can easily spend 150 euros in gas and tolls . 
  still , i expect more people to vote in the june elections , and they are an unknown factor in these elections . 
  syriza is predicted to gain at least 5 percentage points , possibly moving him to 1st place . 
  civil war w.r.t. 
  leaving the euro ? 
  unlikely , but not impossible . 
  interestingly , there seems to be an educational divide : people with only basic education ( also , manual laborers , farmers ) tend to want to leave the euro , but people with higher education want to stay in the euro . 
  personally , i see here a chance to move some old-timers ( that time-shared ministries and favors to friends & family ) off the political chart and let some fresh faces enter the stage ; faces that i hope are n't as beholden to special interests ... 
  this guy has [ an analysis ] ( http://lolgreece.blogspot.com/2012/05/primary-deficit-continues-to-fall.html ) that shows that greece is expected to have a net primary budget surplus by october . 
  granted , he 's not using month-by-month expenses . 
  well , you could also be a lost illegitimate child of niarchos . 
  from personal experience ( & personal contacts ) , 25 % + -10 % is closer to reality . 
   digging yourself out is what greeks ( or any person with problems ) should do , not digging themselves in . 
  the full-contact austerity imposed by eu/imf/germany / france/netehrlands/smurfs looks to have had only result # 2 so far ... 
  no , none of the major parties support leaving the euro . 
  afaik only 2 out of 7 parties support that , for a total 15 % of popular support . 
  europe and the euro are seen as very positive items/ideas/achievements , and frankly , given past behavior , the populace has shown remarkable restraint w.r.t. 
  current austerity ( in the sense that austerity was accepted to a degree by the man on the street ) .

  and al-fitnah [ disbelief or unrest ] is worse than killing ... but if they desist , then lo !, 
  allah is forgiving and merciful . 
  and fight them until there is no more fitnah [ disbelief and worshipping of others along with allah ] and worship is for allah alone . 
  but if they cease , let there be no transgression except against az-zalimun ( the polytheists , and wrong-doers , etc. ) '', 
   quran ( 3:56 ) - `` as to those who reject faith , i will punish them with terrible agony in this world and in the hereafter , nor will they have anyone to help . '', 
   quran ( 3:151 ) - `` soon shall we cast terror into the hearts of the unbelievers , for that they joined companions with allah , for which he had sent no authority '' . 
   quran ( 4:74 ) - `` let those fight in the way of allah who sell the life of this world for the other . 
  whoso fighteth in the way of allah , be he slain or be he victorious , on him we shall bestow a vast reward . '', 
   quran ( 8:12 ) - `` i will cast terror into the hearts of those who disbelieve . 
  therefore strike off their heads and strike off every fingertip of them ''  quran ( 8:67 ) - `` it is not for a prophet that he should have prisoners of war until he had made a great slaughter in the land ... '' etc etc, 
  ideology can push people too far , true . 
  then again , we do n't promote blind ideological fanaticism , do we ? 
  why should we tolerate that in religion ? 
  i will go a bit further and say religion can be more destructive too due to the promise of an afterlife which ideologies generally do n't have . 
  ideologies are about the now which usually means people will avoid effective , but self-destructive , practices when following them . 
  every religion has some shitty practices in it . 
  from the most peaceful ( jainism ) to the least ( african human sacrifice/cannibalism religions ) . 
  we ca n't pretend like religion is a non-factor when it clearly influences and is the stated cause of action of these people . 
  christianity , while it also has shitty passages ( which i am sure people know of ) is not as bad as islam for several reasons : christianity was written from many perspectives over a long period of time and was officialized in the council of nicea almost 300 years after the death of jesus . 
  between all that , it leaves for a ton of room for interpretation . 
  the qu ` ran ( not the shuras which are different ) was written by a single man ( muhammed ) over his lifetime and has remain unchanged since . 
  it also contains clear ways to interpret it without any confusion . 
  in this book , muhammad promotes death to his critics , violent war against infidels and barbaric practices such as pedophilia and polygamous marriages . 
  the shuras , while more debatable , in their vast majority are n't any better either and most jihadists reject the vast majority of them , if not all . 
  islam has a far more rigid structure and its basis , which is violent , is absolutely concrete . 
  any person who claims islam promotes peace or peaceful co-existance is a liar or uninformed . 
  muslims can be ( and very often are ) * good people despite islam * . 
  they are not good people * with * islam . 
  many christians are the same but modern christianity is so twisted with many passages ignored or taken out in modern churches that it simply ca n't be equated with the far more barbaric form of it we had 500 + years ago . 
  islam should reform much like christianity has . 
  until then , islam is a problem . 
  bad people will do bad things but only religion can make good people do bad things . 
  we do n't know who did that yet . 
  we should wait and see . 
  meanwhile , my condelences to the families of the victims and i hope the police stop whomever is doing this before they do more damage . 
  quick , let 's discuss why it 's actually called `` constantinople '' while they are n't looking :\\ ^ ) on a serious note , bah , fucking sucks guys . 
  hopefully they reverse this soon . 
  ** full text for those without a subscription to the economist : ** when the european union picked malta as the site for this week 's eu-africa migration summit , it seemed a logical choice . 
  the island nation is perched in the mediterranean halfway between libya and italy . 
  for a time , it was one of the top destinations for migrants from africa trying to reach europe . 
  and valletta , malta 's fortified baroque capital , is a very telegenic spot for a summit . 
  ( in `` game of thrones '' , a television series , it serves as the backdrop for the port city of pentos , whose own asylum seekers include the targaryans , an exiled royal family . ), 
  but malta is also apt in a way eu leaders may not have intended : as a standpoint from which to observe europe 's increasingly confused attitude towards refugees and other immigrants . 
  african migrants encounter as much undisguised hostility here as anywhere in europe . 
  neil falzon , who runs aditus , a local human rights organisation , says many have been spat upon in the street . 
  as in much of eastern europe , unfamiliarity breeds contempt . 
  until the turn of the century , the island had one of the most ethnically homogenous societies in europe , though its unique identity is actually the product of centuries of racial mingling . 
  ( the result is a native population who look a bit like italians , speak a bit like arabs and drive on the left like the british . ), 
  in the early 2000s , when thousands of african asylum seekers began landing here annually , it came as a shock . 
  `` a lot of elderly people had never seen a coloured person , '' says the leader of the opposition nationalist party , who condemns racism ( while unwittingly using a politically incorrect term ) . 
  maltese xenophobes can fall back on a rational argument : malta is both the eu 's smallest state and its most densely populated one . 
  maltese feel they should have to take fewer migrants than larger states . 
  yet strangely , without anyone much noticing , they seem to have got what they want . 
  malta is barely 200 miles from libya , still a major transit country for refugees though no longer as important as turkey . 
  but the flow to malta has virtually shut down -- and no one knows why . 
  over 140,000 migrants arrived in italy by sea in the year to november 10th ; in malta , since the end of january , the number is just 20 . 
  meanwhile , the economy has been thriving . 
  malta has succeeded in becoming something viktor orban , the eurosceptic hungarian prime minister , might dream of : an eu state with enviable growth figures and almost no migrants . 
  the signs of prosperity are everywhere . 
  winter sun-seekers throng republic street , valletta 's main thoroughfare . 
  everywhere one looks , sandstone palazzos are being converted into plush offices for foreign firms . 
  tower cranes dot the horizon . 
  the maltese economy grew in the second quarter at an annual rate of more than 5 % . 
  unemployment is the third-lowest in the eu . 
  the budget deficit this year is expected to be 1.6 % of gdp . 
  malta has undoubtedly benefited from an `` arab winter '' effect , as tourists who might otherwise be in egypt or tunisia opt for a safer alternative . 
  but the government prefers to stress its own contributions . 
  in 2013 joseph muscat , the leader of the labour party , swept to office with an implausible pledge to cut the island 's sky-high energy tariffs by 25 % . 
  helped by the fall in oil prices , he managed it ( though at the cost of getting the state-owned power company to set artificially low prices and rack up debt ) . 
  `` i think that we can do what singapore has done , '' says the 41-year-old mr muscat , who has the same missionary zeal as matteo renzi , prime minister of neighbouring italy . 
  one would think such talk would have migrants hastening to his island . 
  yet there are virtually no new arrivals , no rickety fishing vessels full of human cargo . 
  not a single large boat has landed on malta this year . 
  even migrants rescued by maltese vessels in malta 's search-and-rescue area are being taken to italy instead . 
  conspiracy theorists speculate that the italians are helping in return for a chunk of malta 's lucrative air space , or have secretly been granted prospecting rights for oil and gas . 
  the prime minister denies any secret deal with his friend mr renzi , and protests that malta has taken its share of refugees under burden-sharing arrangements with italy and greece . 
  but mr falzon estimates there are today only about 2,000 migrants on malta who arrived irregularly , less than 0.5 % of the population . 
  fortress malta , fortress europa ? 
  at the eu-africa migration summit , european leaders pleaded with african countries to help them to bring their migrant problem under control . 
  countries that arrest people-smugglers , and accept the return of migrants whose asylum applications have been rejected , will be given aid -- $ 1.8 billion ( $ 2 billion ) of it , says the european commission -- as well as more access to european markets and more visas for their citizens . 
  as the summit was meeting , sweden , one of europe 's friendliest countries to refugees , announced it would set limits on asylum applications . 
  could europe as a whole aim for the same migrant-free prosperity as malta ? 
  perhaps , were it not that malta 's economic renaissance depends heavily on migration . 
  according to the malta employers ' association , expatriates ( european or otherwise ) now make up 12 % of the labour force . 
  foreign workers have flocked to the island nation to work in growth industries such as financial services , generic pharmaceuticals and online gaming . 
  locals say some asylum-seekers who have been accepted in other mediterranean countries , like spain , are coming to malta in search of jobs . 
  the country even offers passports to anyone who invests $ 1m . 
  malta is not keeping immigrants out ; it welcomes them , but preferably if they are european , skilled or wealthy . 
  this may be a viable strategy for small mediterranean islands , but not for an entire continent of greying workers . 
  leaders who draw lessons from malta 's success should keep in mind that if europe wants to bring in immigrants to grow its economy , they will by definition have to come from outside europe . 
  from africa , perhaps . 
   eu has changed a lot in those past 6 months not really . 
  eu is just doing something massively unpopular the past 6 months . 
  eu changed into a centralized , germano-centric model the past 4-5 years at the very least . 
  greece was told what to do and when to do it by merkel since then and no dissent was allowed . 
  it just did n't affect most of europe back then . 
  eh , immigration plays some role too . 
  all my jewish coworkers have at least half their families in israel . 
  although the rate of many jews fleeing certain european countries is worrying . 
  when you sacrifice babies to satan in the name of the world order , do you burn the removed heart or eat it like it used to be traditionally ?

  the eu 's red lines were already known . 
  nothing has been dispelled . 
  i do n't know how else to put this to you but the negotiations have not started . 
  we do n't even know when they will start . 
  nobody negotiated anything - in fact , nobody is even allowed to negotiate anything before article 50 . 
  you are trying to find a rational explanation , which is n't the best approach when it comes to politics . 
  people vote out of emotion . 
  nobody really makes decisions based on facts . 
  a fact-driven society would be completely different from any society in existence right now , i mean it 's kind of hard to even imagine it . 
  so it does n't really matter what the data is , when it comes to eu immigration . 
  what matters is perception , which is manipulated by the media . 
  thanks for apologizing but you should rather try not to be embarrassed for what you are . 
  it 's not bad being an immigrant . 
   it has . 
  the stance of the government is currently that we 're fine being outside the single market if we do n't get concessions for immigration . 
  the stance of the eu is that they 'll never budge on immigration . 
  this was known for years beforehand , brexit or no brexit . 
  freedom of movement is not subject to change . 
  i ca n't believe that still has n't got through to you . 
  so anyway , nothing has changed . 
  except maybe some of your people realizing that your politicians are full of shit , and withdrew their support of brexit . 
  ah yes , how could i forget the english semantics of political discourse . 
  if you are white ( or come from the `` correct '' kind of country ) then you are an expat . 
  brits and americans love to call themselves that , when they live abroad . 
  if you are dark skinned ( or come from the `` wrong '' place despite being white e.g. 
  balkans ) then you are labelled an `` immigrant '' . 
   its better because someone who is consistently wrong should n't be listened to strangely enough he did n't mention anyone  do you think the experts at the imf were right about the economic solution to greece problems ? 
  would you listen to them about such matters in the future ? 
  everyone was wrong about greece . 
  but i can grant you that and still it 's not * just * the imf who warned against brexit . 
  so the point you are trying very hard to make does not make sense . 
  the dude said `` experts from organizations with acronyms '' . 
  i mean has the bar dropped so low ? 
  you are an immigrant yourself . 
   and , last but not least , politically correct culture which punishes those who openly express negative opinion of this . 
  dude , that shit is not fashionable anymore . 
  you played the whiny victim for far too long . 
  i think people caught onto it . 
  claiming that you are being victimized by political correctness does not make you look like a proud patriotic hero , as you probably image . 
  instead it just makes you look sad . 
   so , 50.3 % leave , 49.6 % remain . 
   not much change there . 
  pretty huge change , considering the margins . 
  brexit won by 3,78 % of the popular vote ( 51,89 % vs 48,11 % ) . 
  based on this poll , brexit would win again by 0,7 % . 
  that is a like a fifth of what is used to be . 
  so it 's like brexit 's advantage became five time smaller and brexit has not even started . 
   a majority of uk adults feel the need for britain to govern itself outweighs the economic risks of brexit with 56 % holding this opinion in comparison to the 44 % who take the opposite view . 
  britain always governed itself , so this is inconsequential . 
   more people approve of theresa may 's performance regarding the ongoing negotiations over brexit than disapprove ( 58 % total approve figure compared to 25 % total disapprove figure ) wer n't you being ironic about brexit 's negotiations recently ? 
  that we are blaming all bad things on brexit despite it not having started ? 
  well ... you are right . 
  the negotiations have not started . 
  so how can people approve or her handling that has not even began ? 
   27 % of uk adults would like there to be an early general election if the government 's brexit plans are to be carried out before 2020 . 
  this compares to 33 % who would not like there to be an early general election in this instance and 32 % who do n't mind either way . 
  as above , these are very tiny margins . 
  conclusion : it seems you guys are dangerously split in the middle , with no consensus in sight , just one side trying to ram its views down everyone else 's throat . 
  also , what the fuck has the media done to your people ? 
  that is pretty much all they had in common, 
   i know little about golden dawn , just what the press tells us , that they are basically new nazis . 
  comparing them to a generic right wing party is not only inaccurate but also ignorant . 
  i did n't compare them to the right . 
  we were talking about nazis . 
  feel free to end it though . 
  except your center-left is not in a death spiral , in fact i think they won your last elections by a big margin . 
  so i 'm not sure you understood the article . 
   go read what i said in my previous comment about it . 
  somehow i trust a director of the world health organization more than you , no offence  if you are talking about golden dawn , that 's not right wing yeah they are nazis , that 's what we were talking about right ? 
  they voted for this , so democracy . 
  so yes you are implying that, 
   i 've read it and i do n't think they 're being xenophobes the president is making up shit about the refugees , like saying they are bearers of parasites and will cause epidemics , something that is directly refuted by the who . 
  so yeah , top level politician , caught lying , targeting a specific group of people , even when his country has accepted to take in 9,000 of them . 
  pretty much textbook xenophobia . 
   and i think this term is being abused nowadays that nazism is a thing of the past except our # 3 political party is national socialist in its ideology . 
  so while i wish it was a thing of the past , reality proves otherwise . 
  you are not doing simply that , but you linked it with brexit or rather with the flight of financial business . 
  now i am questioning that . 
  business fleeing wo n't trigger a recalibration . 
  or , i do n't see how that can possibly happen . 
  i think it will just make the uk poorer . 
   so refusing to take in tens of thousands of unidentified people means being xenophobic to you ? 
  you are painting with a very broad brush here . 
  but i would say : depends on the reason . 
  for example some parents ( a tiny minority , thankfully ) in some greek complain about refugees kids attending greek school . 
  they actually threatened with violence and illegal actions over it . 
  part of their reasoning was that these are not christian orthodox children and do n't share greece 's traditional culture , whatever that is . 
  that is literally the definition of xenophobic . 
  more importantly , if you read the guardian 's article , you would read the justification for these accusations , something you have not addressed . 
  how so ? 
  i am asking about europe , but i would be interested to know how the european traditional left is dragging down canada too . 
  i was questioning the `` automatically '' part of your statement . 
   it 's funny how when there 's a right wing government ** automatically ** is branded as xenophobic , authoritarian and usually they also say populist . 
  i do n't think anyone automatically said that . 
  unless someone set up a bot which * automatically * replied once the elections finished , that did n't happen . 
  also , `` deal with it '' is something douchebags say . 
  i mean its not polite . 
  imagine if i said : * you are a nazi , deal with it * . 
  i would be a douche , no ? 
  i trust you can see where am i going with this .

  but its sad that you are so quick to accept it , if the majority somehow happened to vote 52 % `` kick the smelly poles out '' that would be the best example of mob rule to date . 
  and you would be happy with that since you are ( i presume ) a right winger , you are happy with any decision as long as your side wins , even if your own people get fucked . 
   i see you like to tell people what is better for them , maybe you should i do n't know start a party , be a dictator ? 
  you sound like having habits of a boss telling people what they should do , think , and even feel . 
  it is great to be so progressive when you are scooping for yourself the cream of globalism and multiculturalism while common person is unseen behind tall gate of your closed community . 
  but that 's my wild guess . 
  there is an objective reality regardless of our feelings my friend . 
  besides that , your essentially godwin defence is disappointing . 
  just because someone disagrees with you does not mean he is a dictator who wants to control the thoughts of the people . 
  but you are right in that i am scooping the cream of globalism and multiculturalism . 
  damn right i am . 
  it 's the only kind of system that gives me freedom , contrast that to the nationalists that want to control all aspects of my life . 
   what happend now is that left was encouraging once more , climate change and civil war . 
  the left did not pour any gasoline , because the left is not in charge . 
  a conservative , right wing anti-multiculturalist leader , merkel , is in charge . 
   brexit is consequence of all that . 
  crime is down . 
  people are objectively safer today than they were in their glorious all-white all-christian days . 
  so it objectively ca n't be that . 
  what i learned the past year is that people put feelings over reality . 
  i think we misunderstimated that . 
  it does n't matter if people are objectively ( like , measurably ) safer , more educated , more rich and more powerful . 
  what matters is their feelings , and if they are hurt or offended , they will burn everything to the ground to take revenge for their hurt feelings . 
  not that that information changes anything , just saying . 
  we could not have prevented the refugees from showing up since we did not take any action to stop climate change or assad . 
  we could not make the eu countries work together to handle the situation , mostly because the right wing was doing everything it could to prevent this cooperation . 
   if hundreds of thousand of my nationals have to come back to poland so millions of brits can be happy in their own country , so be it . 
  it is their own country . 
  mob rule , yes . 
  the same mentality that led to every human social disaster in history . 
  of course they can kick the poles out , no shit , the army and the police is controlled by the government after all . 
  they can do whatever they want . 
  but this decision will never be respected . 
  these people did nothing wrong . 
  your fellow countrymen lived productively in peace , but now they are kicked out because `` turkey and iraq will enter the eu , the eu wants to ban the queen and 350 million pounds are stolen by brussels '' . 
  that is the actual reason . 
  not a fair reason to kick these people out imho . 
  you can make shit up , this referendum just proved it, 
   but left wings likes to ridicule right so they can keep on pouring gasoline on fire because reasons . 
  unfortunately its the right that needs the gasoline . 
  right wing populist parties are elected on frustration and anger . 
  the left has no use for gasoline . 
   what 's wrong with that ? 
  we will soon find out my friend . 
  i hope its not as devastating as i predicted , for the sake of your people , but we will find out soon enough . 
  nice to see how nationalists can just gamble with the livelihoods of people without any care in the world . 
  this wo n't be forgotten , not for a long time, 
  ah ok , good thing the eu is stabilized now thanks to your kind imagine if we 'd have listened to soros , eu would be in such a divided state now / s, 
   fuck cdu morons for fucking driving britons out . 
  blame the nationalists , they wanted freedom and they got it . 
  the cdu does not have responsibility in the free choices of others, 
  lol soros is holy holy grail of conspiratards, 
  funny thing is if someone asked you `` how has brussels oppressed you '' you would have nothing to say , except 350 million pounds a week . 
  because we need independence and freedom and national pride and fuck the nato and we are giving away 350 billion euros a month to nato . 
  death to the traitors, 
  i like how you blame anyone else but him `` do as the blonde man says or democracy will enter crisis ! '', 
  seriously dude, 
   your implied accusation of xenophobia on my part is particularly hurtful no implied accusation my friend . 
  its not xenophobia , its just that you are a victim of greece 's historical pr marketing  german law , which also has quite a few of them , is no exception to this . 
  which is why its retarded to see everyone talking about these alleged secular values . 
  islam is not the reason turkey ca n't join the eu . 
  cyprus is . 
  even if everyone in turkey was a fedora tippin ' neckbeard , turkey could still not join the eu because cyprus would never let them, 
   i never said i need easier access , it 's europe i was talking about apparently not because nobody is asking for it  when governments ca n't keep their citizens safe , tightening gun control is criminal . 
  crime is low and keeps getting lower . 
  its way safer than our parents time, 
  i didnt ask if you wan na keep them you said you need easier access . 
  why ? 
  what exactly are you facing that your existing guns ( which i am sure are plenty , and also highly functional ) ca n't deal with, 
   a eu state needs to be secular at least in large parts bullshit . 
  do you know this country called greece ? 
  we were accepted in the eu in 1981 and have a proud national state church whose roots go [ very deep in the state apparatus ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/us-greece-blasphemy-idusbrea0g0o620140117 ) and in society in general ( i mean the first google result for that clusterfuck was al jazeera ffs ) but we are white and * hurr durr ancient greece is awesome hurr socrates and aristotle * so we get a free pass . 
  but the turks have fought very hard for secularism and despite that they get shat upon , which is not fair, 
  of course . 
  since he was n't a muslim , its `` nutjob '' by default, 
  the christian faith is not modern, 
  do n't change the goalposts so easily religion had little to do with the genocides and i am sure you know this . 
  it was nationalism look at my flair . 
  we survived , even as second class citizens , we had that right . 
  on the other hand try being a muslim in medieval europe . 
  would never happen would it ? 
  tl/dr ; you have to be very naive to think any religion spread voluntarily, 
  you mentioned you own several guns why do you need easier access ? 
  is your arsenal lacking ? 
  please tell us what possible threat you might face that your existing guns ca n't deal with, 
   islam on the other hand has tons of mosques in europe what % ? 
  i would but they live in the mountains where they have been historically isolated . 
  not all of us had that luxury . 
  they are also not useless , lazy and divisive cunts . 
  which helps , if you want to build a decent society . 
  we get it , you are never allowed to blame the christian religion on the other hand muslims are fair game no matter what lets just put this on the faq and be done with it, 
  hate to break this to you but neonazis go against anyone who isnt a neonazi . 
  like dont think that you are safe just because you happen to be a right winger, 
  once more you are not living in the god damn usa . 
  gun control is not a left/right issue in europe also the idea that not carrying guns ( or letting females carry them as you said ) is to blame for the disarray is a powerfully retarded statement . 
  like as if we all carried guns on us things would be better ? 
  the disarray is caused by a civil war and climate change , not lack of pistols on your pocket you wan na be james bond  as for the media there were plenty attempts to censor things ( such as attacks in cologne ) . 
  it was not censored , breitbart is full of shit as usual , bunch of hysterical trolls and insecure manlets , if that is your best example then you need some more my friend, 
   then you and your way of `` thinking '' is precisely the reason we 're in this shit . 
  i see , so i am to blame for these terrorist attacks .

  e.t.c ) are . 
  so what you do here is take my statement out of context to show that i conceded . 
  come off it , coward . 
  you are proven wrong . 
  gtfo . 
  ofcourse i am angry . 
  you tire me out with your failing attempts to garble the facts . 
  keep on trucking . 
  edit : 1-0 in my favor , please go on with the rest of the points . 
  i dare you . 
   you accepted the point yourself but said it would take thousands . 
  you already accepted that . 
  you also said they were rich , but that they 're not is by the by ( although it does show you 're guessing ) . 
  you were shown that it is in the hundreds and hundreds of thousands . 
  how can you be so stupid . 
  6th time i mention it : demand , supply , local economy , laws , foreign market magnitude ( because those thousands will not go to one country but several , so even your link is useless here ) and the foreign salary - buying power . 
  you are trying big time to save your ass but you can not . 
  you are a pseudo-intellectual manchild trying to cling on this distortion of facts because you know you have lost . 
  you stall your defeat . 
  this attempt though is so obvious that even a 6th grader can massacre you . 
  point is this : you may keep ignoring deliberatly my argument but as i said , i am not trying to persuade you , it is the others i do . 
  you are a coward . 
  probably a coward in real life as well , judging by how you treat a discussion on the internet . 
  you can pull shit like this here but in real life you would n't even speak your mind when presented with an opportunity to debate . 
  it is 1-0 in my favor . 
  please , continue with the other points . 
  entertain me more . 
  check four posts earlier and you will see that i addressed your point . 
  do n't let me repeat it , stop embarassing yourself . 
  do me a favor : ** read the post ** please , i am trying to help you understand now . 
  i felt bad yesterday for mocking you ( rightly so ) and i 'll make up for it . 
  let 's go step by step , ok ? 
  lol i adressed it 3 posts ago , explained it to you but you answer with copy pasta all the time . 
  i am really enjoying being witness of your mental breakdown . 
  go on and amuse me but do n't expect any new posts . 
  bye butthurt friend . 
  edit : this is you , the resemblance is cunning . 
  lol no . 
  you are in delirium dude . 
  let it go , you lost . 
  this is the end then . 
  you were defeated two times : 1 ) in the main debate . 
  2 ) in your folly attempt to garble the facts to save your ass . 
  i outed you , proved you wrong . 
  i was not mistaken when i stated that your username is relevant . 
  you are not only that though . 
  you are stupid , stubborn and ignorant . 
  the point of a debate is to persuade others and not the opposition . 
  you may have the last words , if you want . 
  do n't make it too long though . 
  you look like a fool already . 
  oh my hahaha , you shitty little troll . 
  now you show your real face . 
  this is what i wrote in that post :  apart from the fact that you do n't mention what happened , you still do not understand how it does n't work against the local population . 
  i explained it above . 
  you think the market as a simple dynamic system . 
  it is n't . 
  there is demand , supply , foreign and local investment . 
  in conjuction  if foreigners acquire property it does n't mean that the prices will rise . 
  for fuck 's sake , how did you infer that ? 
  do you think that a property seller will rise the prices after he supplied the foreigners ? 
  if the demand falls to the earlier stages ( before foreign investment ) then the prices will remain the same and probably fall , if there is no demand at all . 
  later , i say it even more clearly ( 2nd post )  that means nothing when you do not show with evidence how it affects the market . 
  what numbers , with what exact ranges , participate in local markets . 
  i underlined in my post the need for demand , supply and prices . 
  you again did n't answer . 
  i will offend you again because you are starting to tire me out with your obviously deceiving demeanour . 
  you are defeated . 
  thinking and responding in your natural language is n't enough , manchild . 
   you said that the effect that i was describing , after arguing against it , that if ( a concession in itself ) that were it to be true it would mean thousands ( your capitals ) , instead i showed the case in real life to be hundreds of thousands ( my capitals ) . 
  since you 've accepted if the argument i was making would only be applicable in the case of thousands , do you now concede this , your third concession . ? 
  i said that the effect to take place does n't depend on only the numbers . 
  i mentioned , salary , demand , suppy , local economy 's absorption , foreigners ' salary/pension and laws . 
  i have stated those factors 3 times already and you continue to ignore them . 
  so , if anything , this proves that you are a pathetic little liar . 
  address this one and then the rest wil be addressed . 
   that does n't change you 've just had to make concessions that i 'm right , and as an opening salvo it certainly does n't help your credibility . 
  i shall , of course , rise above it ... you do not know what the word '' concession '' is . 
  you are beyond delluded . 
  let 's see what you write again . 
   again , it is you that 's just conceded you 're wrong so condescension is n't a luxury you can afford . 
  obviously , if you do n't know what the noun means , you do n't know what the verb means as well . 
  not a big suprise there . 
   says the one that that came out with 3 points to which i specifically addressed and agreed with , but highlighted the alternative , more provisional perspective , and to which you tried to argue that i had n't addressed at all , and then conceded later that , in fact , i had . 
  you would go on to address them . 
  cognitive dissonance much ? 
  i argued that you were wrong.what you addressed here was the obvious consequences of that symbiotic life . 
  my initial response was made against your remark to the op : that you would prefer the stronger currency anytime . 
  i explained it to you why the weaker currency has advantages but you , like a stubborn manchild , tried to passively aggressively at the start underline why the stronger currency is better . 
  that 's exactly the reason why you failed . 
  you replaced `` proof '' with `` preference '' / `` i 'd rather . 
  you are back pedalling now , because you know you are weak . 
   you however seem strangely evicted from providing real life examples . 
  china and usa say hello , dummy . 
  are you fucking stupid ? 
   ` effect ' if you 're going to use my language , if you do n't mind . 
  whatever , i just provided sources that that is in fact what happens . 
  bury your head in the sand if you wish . 
  you just conceded that it would mean thousands of people to deliver this ` e ` ffect , to ` a ` ffect it as i said . 
  i simply showed how the figure is in the hundreds of thousands .

  nope !, 
  actually this headwear was byzantine . 
  the turks took it from them . 
  happy birthday greece !, 
  sigh, 
  perhaps mate . 
  i hope so ... 
  cause i 'm sick and tired of the ages old mantra `` greeks and turks are at each others throats '' etc. 
  we arent . 
  we only want our peace and quiet . 
  we have enough problems on our own and we dont need any general or politician from the east to create problems cause he wants `` public acceptance '' . 
  until recently almost everyone in europe was wandering `` why the heck does greece spend so much on their army '' ? 
  well now they now how it is to have a lunatic govern a neighboring country . 
  you know how it goes mate ... `` do as i say , not as i do '' you immoral * ( x ) * . 
  in place of x please put some geographic generalization ( southerner , east european etc. ), 
  i do agree with what you are saying . 
  and what you describe is universally accepted as true . 
  there is a huge difference the way you put it and the way it was by r/fortean . 
  look at it :  there 's little doubt it will be greece , ** especially because it will actually help ** the greek government as well as the turkish one . 
  this is totally wrong . 
  that statement implies that there is a special reason and an actual fact in our case . 
  that it will happen * ** especially and because ** it will help our govt * . 
  erdogan cares for no one else but his own govt and that 's the only fact, 
  no fecking not . 
  we constanlty have to face provocations as the ones that all europe is now facing . 
  that doesnt mean we want them , like them or put us on the same level . 
  one can not `` equalise '' the agressor and his victims . 
  it is simply disgusting . 
  see a turkish analysis on the subject : http://www.turkishminute.com/2017/01/31/opinion-turkey-picking-fight-greece/ you see that the problem goes beyond erdogan . 
  fortunately not all turks fall for such antics . 
  what kind of idiotic leveling is that ? 
  how can you say something that stupid ? 
  and most of all unjust . 
   because it will actually help the greek government as well as the turkish one do you imply that erdogan choses his `` targets '' thinking which foreign government will be helped by his verbal attacks ? 
  is this why he chose netherlands or germany and - for instance - not portugal ? 
  had he in his mind the opportunity to help merkel 's govt ? 
  and how something like that would help the greek govt ( and more so than some other govt ) ? 
  the only thing that would help our fecking govt is some financial success story . 
  something that tsipras isnt able to provide . 
  seriously ... did you pull this out of your arse ? 
  i think it will be us . 
  edit . 
  turks see it too : [ why turkey is picking a fight with greece ] ( http://www.turkishminute.com/2017/01/31/opinion-turkey-picking-fight-greece/ ), 
  it 's just a [ prank ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq2wrglmsjk ) bro . 
  can also mean `` reason '', 
  it was a joke mate !, 
  hey !, 
  cough * orthodox * cough, 
  hahahah not only that but also by feeling he had to explain to the southerners that this was only bluntness , he indirectly suggest we are not used to the truth and are hypocrites !, 
  :d lol, 
  and do n't forget ... a bit of heat over the internet is fun . 
  but it 's only that : a joke . 
  to swallow , to accept !, 
  anyway ... whatever our opinions , everything 's fine by me . 
  have a nice afternoon buddy !, 
  lol it 's very hard for you to neck it down . 
  we 've got used to it . 
  also we have hope for them . 
  there are plenty decent people there . 
  sooner or later they 'll take control . 
  i wish ... but dont hold your breath bro ... 
   `` if europe continues this way , no european in any part of the world can walk safely on the streets . 
  we , as turkey , call on europe to respect human rights and democracy , '' omg !, 
  not even in antarctica ? 
  how ` bout japan ? 
  chile ? 
  ** panic ** what will i do ? 
  where should i go ? 
  i guess protestant europe aint western since they ( like us ) opposed catholicism . 
  even in the same religion & dogma cultures can differ quite alot .

  yeah right !, 
  lol, 
  there 's nothing more ridiculous than someone laughing on his own ignorance and missconseptions . 
  the `` west '' is a term to discribe a certain civilization : the greco-roman one . 
  the term might have been used later but it always refered to exactly that . 
  christianity became part of the western identity later . 
  it 's not even necessary to be part of the west , as many heathen ( were ) or atheist nations belong to the west . 
  it 's not surprizing that you have this misconception about what is western because it is a cultural thing to which you dont belong . 
  just look at the state of modern turkey . 
  after a century of securalism the country goes full speed to become something like pakistan . 
  a theocratic state . 
  all the western values failed cause they were foreign to your culture . 
  yet you think you know what `` west '' is lol . 
  it is not a geographical term ( australia is a western society ) and certainly not a religious one . 
  surely islam would never appeal the west as it has many elements that contradict our civilization . 
  do yourself a favor and try to educate yourself a bit : historian es creasy , in 1851 , included marathon in his account of the 15 decisive battles of world history , and more famously , in 1846 , john stuart mill declared in his essay on early grecian history and legend : `` the true ancestors of the european nations are not those from whose blood they are sprung , but those from whom they derive the richest portion of their inheritance . 
  the battle of marathon , even as an event in british history , is more important than battle of hastings . 
  if the issue of that day had been different , the britons and the s might still have been wandering in the woods . '' '' [ western ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/western_culture ) culture is characterized by a host of artistic , philosophic , literary , and legal themes and traditions ; the heritage of ** greek ** , roman , jewish , [ 1 ] celtic , slavic , and other ethnic and linguistic `` a ** cornerstone of western thought , beginning in ancient greece ** and continuing through the middle ages and renaissance and into modern times , is a tradition of rationalism in various spheres of life , ** developed by hellenistic philosophy , scholasticism , humanism , the scientific revolution and the enlightenment ** .

  idiot !, 
   maybe he meant well i very much doubt it . 
  such remarks are on the same level as erdogan 's . 
  yeah right the south is decadent and the north has hard working moral people . 
  we know the story ...

  as for `` expelled '' that was according to a treaty we both signed . 
  and as for those `` 2 million '' when are you going to apologise for way more millions of greeks , armenians , kurds , assyrians and countless others you have killed ? 
  oh , that 's right , never . 
  and not having shitty working conditions . 
  are unicorns and other mythical creatures also included in luxembourgish law ? 
  thanks , but what that guy said made no sense at all , i must say . 
  when did i say anything about germans and trojans , mate ? 
  when ? 
  3000 years ago ? 
  they 've been greek for milennia . 
  that 's like saying turkey is trojan or hittite , 
  that ; s a peculiar statement . 
  french guyana has quite a lot of native cultural elements which are not european , though it certainly has european influences . 
  cyprus is historically , ethnically ( to a large degree ) and culturally european and solely so . 
  huh ? 
  i 'm greek and i agree . 
  no idea what that other guy was thinking . 
  cyprus is culturally european . 
  how is turkey ? 
  the fact that this guy is getting downvoted to heck proves his point even more , despite how salty some people might be .

  what about the [ ionian greeks ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/great_fire_of_smyrna ) . 
  not nearly as many people remember those , sadly . 
  except for the part where you can make their life miserable while they remain within it to a point where they 're forced to leave . 
  http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/wikileaks-julian-assange-no-proof-hacked-dnc-emails-came-russia-n616541 i find it hard to believe the `` iraq had wmds '' guys . 
  ps : http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/james-clapper-still-no-evidence-of-any-russian-collusion-with-trump-campaign/article/2622452, 
  indeed , it 's a country . 
   in a text message , with which he announced his willingness to intervene and try to end our asphyxiation , he told me that he struggled to convince hollande and gabriel to find a solution . 
  his message ended thus : `` i do not want my generation to be the one responsible for greece exiting europe . '' i mean , talking to a couple of people did n't seem to help all that much . 
  any help 's appreciated , but i 'm rather skeptical of people who claim to be on our side . 
   he already helped greece and your own officials talked about it . 
  which officials would that be ? 
  and what help ? 
   two days ago , he explained how he wants the eu to forgive part of greece 's debt so its economy can rebound and stay in the eu as a healthy member and not be tempted to leave . 
  i 've heard many politicians say that and few actually go through with it . 
  please do understand why i may be skeptic about it . 
   but hey , he 's just a shit banker , right ? 
  that and he has a taste for older women , 
   hard evidence please point me to it . 
   at least with macron , greece will have new ally . 
  lol yes , totally bro , i 'm sure the former banker will be on our side . 
  really , can we stop with the russia conspiracy theories ? 
  it 's like t_d claiming illegals rigged the us election . 
  she did that herself , with that joke of a debate performance . 
  she looked like a clown . 
  finally , someone who talks sense . 
  i 'm no le pen fan , but i also dislike macron . 
  hamon gave a pretty good interview where he outlined why the abandonment of the working class by the left has led to people like the fn getting 30 % of the vote . 
   what the fuck ? 
   6 hours it 's called a time zone difference . 
  some of us are n't on reddit 24/7 . 
   who besieged the e.u. 
  parliament making comments is not besieging . 
  i come from a country whose parliament * has * been [ besieged ] ( http://www.dw.com/image/38110500_303.jpg ) . 
  see the difference ? 
   with nazi and stalinist comparisons simultaneously ? 
  personally , i find it quite hilarious . 
   you think commodity trader farage from the city of london is your friend ? 
  oh yes , totally , while junker is my bed bud . 
   his only intent with greece is to use the suffering of the greek as a rhetorical weapon against the e.u. 
  i do n't doubt that at all . 
  so what ? 
   you actually think some trumpist money-hoarding fucker from the london financial industry cares for greece ? 
  nah , not really . 
  but neither does van rompuy , for that matter . 
  one of them is funny , though . 
   the e.u.-skeptics the e.u. 
  has to constantly demonstrate its legitimacy against are the ones who scream the loudest that greece should be left to fend for itself . 
  it has demonstrated it by ... showing a clear lack of understanding of economics ? 
  if consumption drops and taxes rise , in what universe does this fix a recession ? 
   you do n't know what you 're talking about nice projection . 
   you 're simply parroting what you heard lol  you 're parroting farage , literally . 
  do i also have multi-coloured fethers , literally ? 
   after six hours , this pathetic summation of `` reasons '' is what you came up with . 
  once again , i do n't sleep and work at the same times as you . 
  for all you know , i 'm sleeping in my pjs while you wait like a neckbeard for me to reply . 
   i will have van rompuy a hundred thousand times as my leader wish granted . 
   screaming are n't we all ? 
   racist , lol , totally racist  pathologically i see you 're a qualified psychologist now . 
   one thing i 'll concede though : wow . 
   the decency and decorum hahahahaha  assault by the british yes , them evil englishmen are invading our fair greater germany again !, 
   they should have torn that whiskey-reeking bully limb from fucking limb . 
  you and erdogan have more in common than one would think . 
   verhofstadt realizes this and is leading the way . 
  into failure , acting like a drunken fool and being generally irrelevant ? 
   juncker understands it too when he 's drunk or not ? 
  intelligent debate at its finest . 
  it 's been a good ride , my lad . 
  i should come around sometime soon , if i ever want a bit of fun . 
  i hope you did n't get a heart attack from reeeeeeeeeeing that hard . 
  really ? 
  have you seen the man ? 
  mr. `` i have the grace of a thousand cardinals '' while never having been elected by anybody ? 
  did you even see the speech van rompuy gave before the famous incident ? 
  countries can do whatever they want and uber can cry me a river . 
  national sovereignty  corporate profits . 
  if you want the opposite to be true , go across the pong , will ya ? 
   luxembourgish . 
  is it bad if that does n't feel like a real language to me ? 
  the difference being that hog campaign while leading parties .

   what they had expected was that greece would slap down a proposal to the troika which did most of what they asked , included a restructure and further bailout and negotiations would start again . 
  that 's what is basically happening tomorrow . 
  people in both sides have been meeting up and weighing on their choices . 
  on the greek side , the pm met the other parties ' leaders and they sort of did a joint statement of `` unity '' . 
  the communist party did n't sign it and the golden dawn leader was n't invited at all . 
  feel free to pm if you want to ask anything . 
  wait what ? 
  ireland did n't have a national water utility up to now ? 
  3 days in athens is way more than enough . 
  do a daily cruise to local islands such as aigina , spetses and hudra or a daily bus excursion to nafplio , mykines and epidavros . 
  we voted `` no '' to the specific deflationary measures that were given to greece as a `` take it or leave it '' offer . 
  wtf happened with the water ? 
  do you have any detailed articles to link me to ? 
  it would be interesting to read more !, 
  27 referendums in total for exiting the eu . 
  each one costing an average of 35 million euros ( lowball estimate ) . 
  the bill would be just shy of a billion euros . 
  totally worth it !, 
  it can always get worse . 
  it could have been worse for croatia or even ukraine as the other user posted . 
  the whole point is that it could get better with specific measures including debt restructuring / relief . 
  i am not the one that claimed that it is the most extreme fiscal adjustment . 
   a little bit worse i would disagree on that part . 
  this is a huge discussion but 60 % unemployment for ages below 25 and 25 % + for the total population are not a little bit worse . 
  just by comparison i believe ukrainians had it better compared to regions ransacked by mongolians with genghis khan . 
  i am using an extreme example but you get my point !, 
  see my [ other answer ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3c4lo3/hello_fellow_europeans_i_am_writing_to_you_as_a/csspxee ) on this . 
  yugoslavia was dissolved then you had a war !, 
  of course it would be worse !, 
  i am now reading on your recent recession ; it was terrible for you guys !, 
  it 's just a detail . 
  the declaration of independence was on the 24th of august , 1991 and it was ratified by a referendum on the december of the same year . 
  my point being is that you can not compare the effects of dissolving a country into several other countries with a recession within a single country . 
  that 's the same reason that people do n't directly compare recessions in war torn countries other than just making figure comparisons . 
  this is not a dick measuring contest . 
  to be precise , in 1990 when the data begins , ukraine has n't still declared its independence . 
  plus this recession includes the dissolution of the ussr , something that was unprecedented . 
  technically this is the forming of a new country and this kind of gdp decrease is preset on all former ussr countries . 
  http://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/original-size/images/2015/02/blogs/graphic-detail/20150221_gdc500.png true , it was * just * a 25 % gdp reduction in 5 years . 
  edit : why the downvotes ? 
  is giving out a chart by the economist so counter productive to discussion ? 
  so my only choice is bulgaria ? 
  for a guy with a greek username you sure know what to say in these situations . 
  one of our major public holidays is called `` day of \u03cc\u03c7\u03b9 '' . 
  the `` no day '' basicaly . 
  there 's a `` vote no '' gathering today and another `` vote yes '' gathering tomorrow in athens ' city centre . 
  alternatively follow as much media as possible and enjoy the mess ! . 
   so that people wo n't go and drain the banks in certain places , people are already lining up for atms withdrawing as much as they can . 
  the one who celebrates pays . 
  the problem with my country is if you can afford to do so !, 
  istanbul is great but  it 's the actual capital of greece does not compute, 
  with old refugees i meant albanians that are now either settled here or gone back to albania as well as afghans , pakistanis , kurds etc that have been working in greece for the better part of the late 90s and early 00s . 
  especially if they were from a village area ; life there can be much more fulfilling than most people realise . 
  i am glad your father spent his last years happy !, 
   littered the downvotes are due to your language man . 
  no they are not littered . 
  there are areas in athens where there are tons of old refugees that have spent years in athens , but basically the recent huge increase of refugees has n't impacted us as hard as you may think . 
  greece was just a hub in the last couple of years and the 50k or so immigrants that are trapped in camps here is very small compared to the older immigrants . 
  i ca n't find a source now but imagine that because of the crisis , in the last 5 or so years about 500k immigrants left greece to find their luck elsewhere or returned home . 
  i loved my time spent in britain ( no worries , i do n't confuse you with britain ! ), 
  but it is true that i missed the greek sun . 
   even that small junkie filled park in exarchia did not feel that unsafe night it must be because there are a billion cafes and bars filled with people all day ( and night ) long !, 
  this is / r/europe , they are not aware of the trope !, 
  brussels was a shock to me really , it has tons of cement everywhere ; the buildings are beautiful though !, 
  i loved how vienna was full of parks btw , having destroyed fortifications all around leaves a ton of space for green areas compared to athens and its reasons for being like that !, 
  less touristic ? 
  there will be busloads of tourists there at the site !, 
  corinth is a shitty city with some nice archaeological sites ; i 'd stay in nafplio , if i was you , and visit mykines , corinth and epidavros . 
  there are also tons of archaeological sites in northern greece closer to you . 
  samothraki and thassos for example have their share of archaeological sites and are really beautiful ; i personally could n't recommend samothraki enough !, 
  i 've spent a lot of time at that island !, 
  there 's also thessaloniki which has a very rich history as you well know and you can combine it with vergina and pella to see stuff from the ancient macedonian era . 
  a little bit to the south you can find the dion at pieria . 
  island wise you would probably love the island of dilos , 
  i 've seen better `` green '' wise and i 've seen worst . 
  you are close by mate , come over for a few days instead of just driving to the awesome northern greece !, 
   meh , i hope it does n't get better that way syriza ca n't take credit a and they do n't win another election . 
  thanks man !, 
  i love it when my fellow europeans wish us the best !, 
  well , it is as recognised as `` your '' being used instead of `` you 're '' is . 
  let the americans and british destroy their language while we foreigners do our best !, 
   but nationalism can also be dangerous , if it leads to believing that your nation is not only superior , but that all other nations are inferior . 
  spoken like the uncivilised inferior western-russian that you are . 
   mute point --  moot point http://blog.dictionary.com/moot-point-vs-mute-point/ sorry for being the grammar nazi here but compared to the rest of your fantastic english this jumped out to me . 
  it 's not like `` facts '' are factual bro !, 
  yeah , i was going to do my erasmus in finland but all places were `` filled '' so i went to my second choice ... 
  it reminds of of areas * i 've visited * and i do n't recall bilbao having any of those peppers hanging around . 
  do espelette peppers grow in the spanish side ? 
  btw , no such thing as unified basque `` country '' at this moment but you know this better than me . 
  the fact that you point out the `` not france '' part is funny but expected according to your flair . 
  just a quick observation . 
  the island that you see there is the `` new '' isalnd that was created from the large explosion ~ 4k years ago after the largest part of the isalnd was destroyed and a huge caldera was created !, 
  check it [ here ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/14/santorini_landsat.jpg ) ; yes , that really looks like a crater because it basically is a crater . 
  this reminds me the basque regions in france !, 
  same in my area in peloponese . 
  afghans , pakistanis and kurds have returned home or moved to another country . 
  albanians have either returned or they have settled in perfectly and asians reside around the cities with their commerce and do n't do much of agricultural works . 
  ok . their population decreased significantly during the crisis ; in several areas there are not even enough workers for agricultural work !, 
   there are large numbers of immigrants all over greece . 
  are you talking about the last batch of immigrants that have been arriving for the last year or so ?

  if i was given the chance i 'd probably trust the anglo-saxon economists . 
  but vat is also taxes . 
  and the imf seems to love raising vat . 
  bollocks !, 
  germany was in they eye of the storm cause there was where the 2 opposing powers met . 
  they just stopped the actual war there and started the cold war . 
  it was the only country/nation in the region occupied from both rival powers . 
  as in asia the only nation that is still divided is korea . 
  when that happens you are in the eye of the storm . 
  no deal is needed . 
  korea is still in the eye of the storm . 
  and keep the snide remarks to yourself . 
  then why all this charade ? 
  you must know the answer , you seem to have a strong opinion . 
  yet many make the comparisons ... `` but the bail outs worked for portugal '' ... etc. 
  truly no similarities . 
  spot on !, 
   germany was propped up after the war due to geopolitical reasons , people tend to forget that being the designated main battle ground for ww3 was part of the whole deal . 
  woah !, 
  do you realize what you just said ? 
  `` part of the deal that germany was the designated ground for wwiii ?!?!? '', 
  who made that deal ? 
  with whom ? 
  i ca n't believe what i just read . 
  all our countries were targeted by the soviet nukes you seem to forget . 
  also no one chose your country to be the center of it all and no agreement was made about it . 
  do you forget why both american and soviet forces came there ? 
  i really ca n't believe what you just wrote trying to defend your self-righteousness . 
  so much self-righteousness is not healthy . 
   the german debt was a result of reparation payments imposed by the winners of the world war . 
  oh really ?? 
  i could be wrong but i thought that they also took `` loans '' from the countries they occupied and also caused lots of destruction too . 
  leverage ? 
  none !, 
  funny though one should need leverage among his `` european family '' that `` only wants to help '' the masks are coming down ... 
  i do understand why everyone gets angry when discovers he is being spied . 
  i really do . 
  i find funny though two things : - when you expect the other `` party '' to do anything needed to be surprised when finding out that `` what is needed '' is defined by him . 
  - to be 2015 to realize that everyone spies on everyone . 
  especially the big ones . 
  unfortunately yes my friend . 
  broomsticks and harsh language ... 
  let me be clear then : no one has to be receptive to `` our plight '' . 
  no one even has to be remotely sympathetic . 
  also all opinions are valid . 
  no problem with that at all . 
  what is unacceptable though is that when we express the view that the program is wrong and unproductive to be hit with the cliche `` greeks always blame the others '' in every possible variant . 
  the fact that the program is wrong and that the measures proposed in it unproductive is also stated by the imf itself . 
  nothing to do with `` sympathy '' or whatever . 
  just basic economics . 
  also i dont expect europe to come to my resque . 
  they can send us to hell . 
  it 's their right and their choice to do so and if they think they should do it they by all means they should go ahead . 
  i cant accept though to be blamed for ** whatever choice ** i might make : * if we make the agreement then `` the damn lazy greeks are taking advantage of us '' - if we dont make the agreement then `` the damn idiot greeks have the nerve to ask more '' how much simpler can i put it ? 
  surely you can as it seems :d but it aint the same by far . 
  an economic catastrophe is different than the loss of sovereignty . 
  dont believe me though . 
  ask an ukrainian who unfortunately has to face both . 
  they 'll tell you which is worse . 
  also as far as i understand it ... : * what greece has done in the ez : failed miserably to follow the rules due to corrupt politicians , now faces the consequences and is also mocked . 
  * what everyone 's done in nato ( except the us and greece ) : failed miserably to follow the rules due to hypocritical politicians and blame the us for taking the burden to defend them . 
  no one mock 's them though . 
  :p also the eu supposedly is more than a military aliance . 
  not ? 
  i will reply your question once and for all : who the hell said anything about bailing out these people ? 
  what the fuck are you talking about ? 
  we replied to / r/buckfost 's post :  `` greece has become an upside-down world where no one feels * ashamed * about not paying their debts . '', 
  this is incredibly serious that we are in an economic union with these people . 
  the question was the morality of those people that chose to feed their kids over paying the mortgage putting in danger their property . 
  no one said anything about bailing them out . 
  is that clear enough now ? 
  isnt it ** obvious ** ?!?!??!, 
  the mortgages are also much higher than those in easten europe . 
  you see the mortgages were made before the crisis and still have those pre crisis values . 
  the incomes have gone down by 40 % if not lost at all ( 25 % unemplloyment and 60 % among the youth ), 
  no , government speding is dictated by the troika for some years now . 
  when the fuss is about matters like pensions for instance , i would think it pretty obvious that government spending is not a free choice . 
  also please , please , please !, 
  stop that mantra `` blame someone else '' whenever a greek makes a point . 
  a point can be correct or wrong . 
  your view on it , is very welcome the blanket cliche `` always someone else 's fault '' nonsense that greeks are always getting hit with , is no less than `` shut the fuck up cause you are greek '' . 
  well we fucked up in a major way , we pay the grim consequences but as far as i know we still have the right of an opinion and the freedom to express it . 
  2 different issues . 
  bail out agreements force that over taxation . 
  this has profound consequences to the real economy . 
  so at the next bail out even more overtaxion is needed . 
  a vicious circle actually that imf itself pointed out ( i am talking about the overtaxion not the errors in their implemented programs ) . 
  where these extra taxes are going to be spend ( debt repayment or other purposes ) is irrelevant on what their effects on the economy will be . 
  edit : hmm nope according to the schedule , the bail out payments are already happening . 
  in fact the hardest year is 2015 . 
  in order for the 1st bail out to take place the agreement was that greece would raise an extra 3.8 billion euros in taxes . 
  for the second one the agreement was that greece would raise an extra 3.9 billion euros in taxes . 
  for this one if the agreement happens the extra taxes to be raised are 7.9 billion taxes . 
  we will saved !, 
  you dont seem to understand what an economic crisis is . 
  it is not only the lowering of the living standards . 
  wish it was only that . 
  it is lives interupted . 
  you have a job you can pay your mortgage . 
  you lose you job or if you are lucky enough you keep your job but your income goes down 40 % ( as it happened to everyone in greece ) , hence you can not pay your mortgage and feed your family .

  about corruption in uk or anywhere else , allow me to be skeptical cause corruption is shown only after something huge goes wrong . 
  it took years for instance for the fact that thatcher covered a paedophile member of her gov. 
  also as for how we think ... allow me to tell you that you know nothing . 
  you only see reactions here . 
  it would be a surprise to you what is being said in the . gr part of the net . 
  reactions here differ as we are always on the defense since for years the cliches were blanket statements like greeks are lazy etc. 
  also to add : the biggest problem of all we face is not the economy . 
  it is the fact that in our political arena only now new faces/parties started to emerge . 
  until now people had no choices ( i mean from 2011 and on ), 
  jesus christ man ... did i put the blame on anyone else but ourselves ? 
  you make assumptions on what i think and you come about snide and dismissing . 
  i 'm done too . 
  that is the idea of democracy ayatollahs have . 
  remember blair ordered the iraq bombing --  blair was democratically elected --  we are entitled to punish the british citizens cause they are responsible . 
  nowhere the fact that blair lied to all , nowhere the fact that not all voted for blair , nowhere the fact that many opposed blair . 
  good simplistic ayatollah thinking !, 
  and you give me advice on democracy !, 
  lol no !, 
  greece = government + opposition + those who did n't vote . 
  it is only technically that are n't a minority gov. 
  due to a system that gives the 1st part a large bonus of sits . 
  have i said that i do n't like democracy ? 
  or is it because syriza was elected , syriza also expresses my views ? 
  it seems that you are the one who brinks russia in our chat . 
  a blanket statement `` greece voted for him '' hence syriza and greece are one and the same atm . 
  :p seriously ... 
  i have n't voted for syriza . 
  also syriza is a minority government . 
  and that mantra `` democratically elected governments so their shit is the people 's fault '' is so damn wrong i ca n't even begin . 
  edit to add : syriza got the 36.3 % of the vote . 
  aka of those who turned in to vote . 
  or else the 36.3 % of the 64.87 % that bothered to vote . 
  many did n't show up cause there was no one who clearly deserved to be voted ( not my opinion but a very common one here ) . 
  that makes that syriza had the confidence of the 23.55 % of those who had the right to vote . 
  hardly syriza equals greece . 
  the sale can not be avoided to be recorded . 
  the product is electronically recorded at the source : i.e. 
  where the retailer bought it before they sell it to you . 
  as for the minimum wage yes that can happen but it 's not the employee 's fault . 
  a very common thing the last few years is this : you work for months without being paid at all and at the end they tell you `` sorry , we ca n't pay you . 
  off you go '' or the company , suddenly moves its operations outside the borders in some more tax friendly eu country ( mostly bulgaria ) . 
  it is far from cute . 
  and i ca n't take the blame for it . 
  i am the victim of it . 
  what are you talking about ? 
  if you are working for a salary in a company , how can you do tax evasion ? 
  the company that pays you , presents your salary as expenses . 
  how can you - the receiver - hide it ? 
  what is that you can do under the table ? 
  greece = / = syriza just to make it clear . 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7fxjoyxl7i :d ( just felt like trolling a bit ) have a great time anywhere you go !, 
  pretty accurate !, 
  have an up vote for your good effort !, 
  the question is that 50 % ( i do n't think it correct but it doesnt matter ) is about who actually ? 
  is it distributed equally to the population ( i.e. 
  half the population doesnt pay or pay less that it should ? ), 
  or is it the top 10 % ? 
  if it 's the latter then it 's hardly the national sport everyone talks about . 
  it is not that greece is against reforming the tax system . 
  not as far as i know of . 
  in fact one of the election promises syriza made was exactly that . 
  i am not a syriza voter myself but this was one of their promises . 
  also as far as i know reforming the tax collection system was never seriously on the table - i wish it were - only raising the taxes , vat etc. 
  some things i know of about the `` tax evasion '' that has blown out of proportion by the media . 
  the largest % of the work force in greece live on a salary ( both because they work in public or in private sector ) . 
  so it is impossible to us to evade taxes . 
  on the other hand large firms , multinational firms and ship owners do . 
  how ? 
  by sheer blackmailing : they owe to the state millions in taxes , they do n't give them and if the government tries to collect then they say in such case we leave and let 1000s of people out of work . 
  many have already done so and moved their operations to bulgaria for example . 
  but these are the things i know . 
  i do n't have more concrete knowledge on the matter . 
  so when you provide a link to show the data you talk about make sure you provide the right one plz . 
  the one you provided was a totally different one . 
  very interesting graph though : italy while greece is at 103.7 , italy is at 108.2 % !, 
  portugal that was totally fine at the time 53.8 found herself at 123.6 % in 2012 ... 
  so does these give any more insight besides the fact that greece cooked its books from 103.7 % to make it an `` acceptable '' for the ez 103 % ? 
  so let it happen then . 
  but lets not call bail outs a fine solution to the problem . 
  as for the tax system in order to be changed troika must agree to it else it is not allowed to be changed by greece on her own . 
  tax system change , curiously were never part of the negotiations though . 
   instead of getting the banks to pay for their spending , they try to make the eurozone tax payers pay for it . 
  who is asking for that ? 
  do you know ? 
  actually who did it already ? 
  do you have an idea ? 
  be informed : greece and the imf : who exactly is being saved ? 
   2001 as greece entered the ez with the actually deficit of 103,7 % of there gdp . 
  what the hell are you talking about ? 
  where did you find that number ? 
  from the link ** you ** posted : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/greek_financial_audit,_2004 `` the requirement that the 1999 budget deficit should have been ** below 3 % of gdp ** was one of the key criteria for eurozone entry ; thus , its revision to 3.1 % , ** the precise figure was actually 3.07 % ** , according to eurostat ( ameco ) , led to a controversy about greece 's admission . '', 
  and with such a monstrous difference from reality , you have the nerve to lol ? 
  do you even understand what you are saying ? 
  mixing totally different thing as ** gdp deficit ** with ** budget deficit ** ? 
  are you for real ? 
  or are you here only to mock and play the blame game ? 
  reforms have been made contrary to what is the general view on the matter : https://rwer.wordpress.com/2015/02/17/reforms-in-greece-an-exemplary-record-but-the-wrong-track-3-graphs/ as for the * `` incoming and outgoing sums match '' * ... they can match wether the surplus is at 0.75 % or 0.8 % or 1.5 % or 3 % . 
  the higher the surplus - in the middle of a severe crisis - the harder the real economy is hit and the harder for it to recover and sustain those surpluses . 
  it is a vicious circle . 
  the fact that the budget remains balanced is easy for ez to check , so to base purely on `` fear '' the non productive on economy measures is false .

  i can accept that , but how the fuck does that make it more reasonable . 
  it is still a retarded vote for them . 
  it 's called freedom of speech . 
  of course , what people like you understand that to mean is `` freedom of not being criticized for my dumb beliefs '' . 
  if , for example , the swiss people collectively decide to enact a barrier between us , they will be shown contempt or anger . 
  it 's how humans function . 
  we did nothing wrong to the uk nor switzerland . 
  the remainers were too weak , too pathetic , taking the eu for granted , being out of touch with their barbaric population who is just out for blood at this point , not caring about the consequences . 
  the backtracking is real dude you just spun 180degrees so fast you generated your own gravity, 
  try having some empathy . 
  these people have not all gone suddenly and inexplicably mad . 
  they do n't hate you . 
  you have to understand , your people voted for barriers between you , humans naturally feel that as a negative experience . 
  and yes you are judged in a collective basis , but that is mostly because people respect your nationality and your connection with it . 
   how does that disprove that the lower classes are competing with cheap labour from eastern and southern europe ? 
  of course people can still find work . 
  they are just forced to accept it against worse conditions . 
  5.4 % unemployment means your economy is doing great and the workers do n't have to significantly compete with one another . 
  it 's also a [ demonstrable ] ( https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/287287/occ109.pdf ) [ fact ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/oct/06/reality-check-is-theresa-may-right-about-immigration ) . 
  but facts do n't matter to you people do they ? 
  their own governments failed them . 
  you failed these people , not the eu . 
   iceland , norway and switzerland . 
  which countries are n't in the eu again ? 
  the idiocy of this statement . 
  all these countries have free movement of people agreements with the eu . 
  you will not significantly reduce your immigration . 
  it is not going to happen , unless you want to wreck your economy . 
  in which case , be my guest . 
  nothing would make me happier . 
   certainly not few enough to pigeonhole leave supporters as `` old pensioners '' . 
  it 's well understood by now that the leavers were old and the remainers were young . 
  i attribute personal responsibility to people . 
  if people become fascists , its because they wanted to become fascists . 
  the `` regressive left '' is not an excuse . 
  if you want to make excuses for fascism , go right ahead , but please leave me alone please . 
   because people in those areas have n't had anything good from the eu . 
  you mean like the [ welsh areas who have received a fuckton of eu cash and still voted to leave ? ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jun/25/view-wales-town-showered-eu-cash-votes-leave-ebbw-vale ) . 
  people do n't care about facts man . 
  the eu had nothing to do with these peoples ' problems , their ( your ) own government did . 
  but it failed them and used the eu as a scapegoat . 
  do n't trust your fucking politicians so much . 
   i voted in , but i 'm beginning to regret it . 
  you mean like [ the morons who voted leave and then regretted it ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/brexit-anger-bregret-leave-voters-protest-vote-thought-uk-stay-in-eu-remain-win-a7102516.html ) ? 
   in fairness , the national socialists were a lot more than nationalists , it was a totalitarian antisemitic regime that arose at a time of unprecedented economic and political turmoil in germany and as for world war 1 , even historians still to this day debate the causes of that catastrofuck . 
  simply saying `` they happened because of nationalism '' is just not accurate , there 's far more to it than that . 
  it 's not debatable . 
  giving fiercely national monocultures the industrial might of the 20th century would inevitably lead to war . 
  for god , king and country . 
   i 'd also caution against the trap of falling into euronationalism ah , we are only allowed to be nationalists of a kind you agree with . 
  only chose from a list of approved cultures , nations , flags , etc. 
   it does n't shock me at all that britain voted to leave , it wo n't shock when others follow suit . 
  will it shock you if you are wrong again ? 
  because it seems you are immune to facts . 
   and ffs , do n't give the eu its own army so eurocrats can start a cock measuring contest with russia either . 
  ah , a brit not wanting europe to be stronger . 
  how surprising ( not ) . 
  and muslim , and atheist, 
  the idea that it has damaged the `` entire western civilization '' is clearly / pol / trolling . 
  no serious person believes that shit, 
  really ? 
  seems to me that half of the sentences coming out of the typical brexiters mouth were a combination of european union nazi hitler fourth reich i 've a liberal for so many years , i mean , we call people `` nazi '' too as you might have noticed , but you guys fucking took it to the next level . 
  absolutely retarded . 
  literally everything in the eu was literally hitler . 
  you just went full retard people wo n't forget that shit , that 's for sure, 
  i would do the same thing if i were you . 
  very little good is going to come out of this do n't you love it when people just make the world worse , for no discernible reason ? 
  lets just add this to the pile of our already huge problems . 
  great !, 
  dude the campaign is over , you can stop calling everyone a nazi, 
   just a bit tired of all the hate and people hoping we will crash and burn so over reacted a bit already ? 
  dude you need to work on your patience . 
  the next 2 years are not going to be easy on your nerves like can you even imagine the shitstorm once the negotiations actually start ? 
  appeasement does not work . 
  we had greece , now the uk , its time to start being assertive or we might as well dismantle the whole thing, 
   i do n't think it 's possible to describe how that feels . 
  i can imagine , but just barely . 
  i also feel embarrassed and shamed for my country . 
  but we never managed to build anything great . 
  you built something great , and are now destroying it on your own . 
  tbh i do n't know if its better or worse . 
   it 's the freedom of sane , intelligent and educated people not to be negatively affected by the dumb choices of idiots that should be protected . 
  it 's not though . 
  yeah in theory i too would love a system where the objective wellbeing of the people would not be debatable . 
  but how can you convince people to have such a system ? 
  nobody wants that . 
  and my debt !, 
  you make me sad, 
  well too bad . 
  at least save some of that hatred for the russians , because they are the ones that originally caused this mess, 
  dude you complain about your economy getting fucked , but then you want to make it worse . 
  its like me complaining about the heat and then jumping in a furnace you are a mad man if you want to burn something to the ground , leave brussels alone , instead go outside and burn a church , as some other [ great norwegians ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/varg_vikernes ) have done in the past, 
  allright then i take your word for it also i said `` non-racist '' , not `` racist '', 
  your fucking original complaint was about the economy , now you do n't care about it ? 
  the uk wo n't fail , it 's just that they will be less than what they were nobody is saying that they will disappear from the map lol and about their `` great society '' . 
  yeah more than half of them make a conscious , willing and unapologetic decision to ignore facts . 
  * we do n't care about the experts and their stupid facts , death to the traitors !, 
  * this must be a world first . 
  i mean i thought greek people were dumb but god damn i am actually starting to like my own people after this debacle, 
  well you must be the exception because numbers do n't lie 73 % to remain in the 18-24 group , 62 % for the 25-34 group .

  i do n't think it 's socially unacceptable in any eu country . 
  i do n't know about other countries but in greece unmarried young people tend to stay with their family or with a roomate/bf/gf to share expenses . 
  that goes for both genders . 
  it 's just a cute term for `` bribe '' . 
  you do n't have to put them in an actual fakelaki xd do you have to bribe for extra tzatziki in germany ? 
  and the communists were backed by yugoslavia and the ussr , it was pretty much the first proxy-war of the cold war era . 
  while the rest of europe was rebuilding we were shooting each other . 
  i do n't think you read the article . 
  that 's a german journalist 's opinion , not a statement by samaras . 
  it 's not even about the economy , it 's about reforms on the public sector . 
  the title is absolutely misleading . 
  that kind of mentality requires education ... 
  first world problems . 
  wait ... if germany is permanently wasted , who 's driving the eu-mobile ? 
  til i 'm not a true macedonian . 
  you 've just single-handedly restored my appreciation to the greek orthodox church . 
  aleksandar makedonski alive in fyrom making fast removal of gyros !, 
  it 's funny because it 's true :p we 've always had a `` yolo '' mentality when it came to money . 
  i think his main issue was that the greek communist party lost the civil war and he had a nato country , with a sizeable minority in southern albania , breathing down his neck . 
  he was probably afraid that greece would try to pull a cyprus in southern albania and you ca n't realy blame him . 
  but he had to walk a fine line between blaming the greek government and blaming the greeks in general , because that would enrage a part of his own people . 
  have you ever read [ that ] ( https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hoxha/works/ebooks/two_friendly_peoples.pdf ) btw ? 
  interestingly enough , the golden dawn also publiced something similar at the time , about how greeks and albanians are a single race and albanians are being misled by communist propaganda . 
  probably to justify the fact that a lot of their member are arvanites . 
  greek-albanian relations is a huge fucking mess . 
  jan pawel ii is rolling in his grave right now . 
  i agree with all your points actualy . 
  i was just pointing out that :  while turkey has mostly coast - like many other european countries - and its position would n't create security issues it 's not as simple as that . 
  maybe he just wants a hug ... 
  err no , look at the map again . 
  turkey borders syria , iraq , iran and the caucasus ( which russia considers within it 's area of influence ) . 
  and then there 's also the kurds . 
  i 'd say it 's one of the most unstable areas in the world right now , if not ** the ** most unstable . 
  they probably think i 'm trolling because of the sex part . 
  but i 'm not . 
  yes , it might totaly be surprise byzantium in disguise \u25d1 . \u25d1, 
  exactly , also due to the [ dublin regulation ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dublin_regulation ) you 'll have to deal with most middle eastern illegal immigrants instead of us . 
  greece is nr1 fanboy of turkey 's eu prospect . 
  i knew you were always the sweet talkers in the neighborhood . 
  screw you , i laughed so hard at this my whole body hurts . 
  not realy , you can easily tell a bulgarian from an albanian by their facial bone structure . 
  still this is irrelevant because :  languages and cultures transcend ethnicities . 
  this . 
  which still does n't mean that you can claim to be whatever you want and i have to accept it though . 
  i can confirm your side of the story . 
  my favourite part in the comments was : ** fake account with greek name ** `` i am greek ... but my neighbors macedonians need to understand that this man mr. georgievski is a traitor . 
  everyone in the balkans deserves their identity equally , we here in greece have many parasites like this man who are corrupt and also greatly responsible for the downfall of greece . 
  hang all of these bastards !, 
  this idiot was more than likely given money under the table to speak his stupid ideas . 
  trust me . '', 
  ** typical greek youtube warrior ** `` if you are greek talk to me greek but in the greeklish way '' * ( note : greeklish is a way of typing greek with latin characters , there is no google translate for that . 
  ) * ** fake account with greek name ** `` lol what does that even mean ? 
  the greeklish way ? 
  whatever he tried to say in greek roughly translates to : `` what do you want me to tell you ? 
  i 'm sutting now and drinking the my morning coffee , and ? 
  wihat else to tell you ? 
  four an hor previous i was sit ing in the loo and made shits '' this is pure commedy gold , people have too much free time in their habds . 
  close enough but one correction , di - is the greek prefix and bi - is the latin one . 
  so the pure forms are `` diglot '' and `` bilingual '' . 
  you got your classical languages mixed up a bit :p, 
  repression of emotions only leads to living on antidepressants in the long run , i know this first hand . 
  arguing for no reason sounds absurd but once you get into that mentality you realise it 's a cathartic experience . 
  plus it makes sex much better . 
  oh come on , that 's a nice church :p i mean i 'm not very religious myself but i do appreciate some nice byzantine architecture . 
  i guess albanians are still suspicious towards greeks because of the whole northen epirus/chameria border disputes and our good relations with serbia ? 
  to be honest there used to be a lot of albanian haters in greece 20 years ago but now it 's a very rare occurrence . 
  if you 're using greek history books it makes sense . 
  remove kebab/balkan wars and venizelos ' shenanigans in ww1 which also make a significant part of that book are also irrelevant to you i guess . 
  they both sent priests and founds the reopen/rebuild churches and restore their influence . 
  greek history books emphasize mostly on the classical period , byzantium and the war of independence ( 1821 ) . 
  nothing is realy `` swept under the rug '' but i guess our history books have a very different scope compared to western europe 's . 
   emphasised : 1821 greek war of independence ( that did n't actually involved cyprus in a direct way ) holy crap seriously ? 
  i feel your pain , that must be awfully boring to you . 
  we let you manage them for us !, 
  they will after they finish rioting for 7-1 . 
  yeah i know about the immigrants , i was just wondering if it 's any different in albania itself , because i also know that after the communist regime colapsed , both the catholic and the orthodox churches fell on albania like birds of prey . 
  the only albanian friend of mine that i felt confortable asking about the situation just replied `` i was never baptised , i do n't realy care '' . 
   i doubt we 're gon na be a muslim-majority population for long , the number of muslim people is going down . 
  is that because of atheism or people converting to christianity ? 
  sure , one more ca n't hurt . 
  [ crap ... ] ( http://treasure.diylol.com/uploads/post/image/613819/resized_horrorcat-meme-generator-omg-hes-back-3d7806.jpg ), 
  russia , because they have an actual army and they are the no1 producer of oil and natural gas . 
  also they will conquer the rest of the world for us . 
  if turkey never showed up we would have had the old one :p 200 years after the break-up and we 're still at court for the custody of the children . 
  the ones that brought misery to eastern europe believed in neither . 
  we refuse . 
  nah , do n't worry it 's a common condition . 
  i recommend more paradox games . 
  i call dibs on the uninhabited land between greece and romania . 
  i promise to be a kind and just king . 
  1 ) you are lazy and poor , pay debts . 
  2 ) ancient greece is dead , you are a greek-speaking turks . 
  3 ) alexander best slav ever , macedonia stronk !, 
  4 ) how are you even replying ? 
  you have internet in greece ? 
  our jimmies are easily rustled lately indeed ... 
  it 's solun in bulgarian btw . 
  and selanik in turkish if you feel like being an even bigger bastard . 
  this is going to be like these akward family reunions ... are they gon na have winged hussars too ? 
  yes , those 3 days in july are incredible !,

  they have handled the situation with a lot of amateur mistakes and arrogance , people dont forget , but also people dont forget the previous corrupt parties . 
  i would assume that it would be a very tight electoral result with coalitions required again for a stable government . 
  the idea is that the law will pass first , so the danger of default/grexit etc passes , and then the government could fall and new elections proclaimed , but the deal would have passed and the situation while still tense will not be on the edge of the abyss . 
  i hope so . 
  half of it maybe , but the opposition is ready to vote on it , so it would pass from the parliament but could lead on new elections . 
  well i thought the shitstorm would end with that terrible deal but nontheless a deal , i was wrong . 
  true but branding a whole nation antisemitic based on a very strangely and biased index or from the actions of few really stupid people is a bit extreme . 
  no offense but some of the questions that brand a country as antisemetic arent exactly fair , for instance question no1 , no7 arent off the scope of fantasy , but the important ones that would indicate clear hate like no10 we see a 38 % in contrast to the rest . 
  arent you the russian troll that thinks stalin didnt order the deaths of millions or katyn ? 
  remembering the good old days of scandals and corruption as mayor of paris . 
  although this act of vandalism is a grave and stupid act , to claim we are the most antesemetic country on europe goes too far . 
  especially considering how many jews were saved on ww2 and the general stance of the populace on protecting em , or even the deep loss of the thessalonica jews , which consisted 1/3 of the city population back then . 
  no , not that , the fact that fage , a greek corporation with large profits , a huge slice of the international market , decided to move to a tax heaven to avoid paying taxes to the country its existence it owes . 
  also reminder that fage is private company , so philipou doesnt have a shareholder crowd demanding to maximize profits and reduce spending . 
  dont remind me fage , they control a huge part of the global greek yogurt market ( especially in the us , they even built a factory to accomodate the demand ) , unpatriotic , unethical but still unofortunately legal . 
  lets hope we see more of this ( and some ethical name shaming for greek corporations that moved their corporate seats on tax heavens wouldnt be bad aswell ), 
  there are some interesting scenarios ahead of us but the certain thing is that the law for the deal will be voted by the parliament majority . 
  scenario a ) tsipras instil party discipline and the deal passes with maybe 1-2 objections from his party but with general support nontheless . 
  scenario b ) tsipras convinces his party but not his partner in government kamenos and his independent greeks party , the deal will pass from the opposition votes but will shake the majority for the government in the future . 
  scenario c ) the left platform lead full blown rebellion and 40 mp dont vote in favor , the deal will still pass though the opposition ( nd/pasok/potami ) but the government is essentially on the brink of new elections if they cant keep party cohesion and open to a vote of non-confidence . 
  the downvotes are for orthodox countries that give it the same value aswell . 
  it makes for a convienent family tree design though , unless we have multiple children , we have to improvise then . 
  not really , we celebrate it in greece as well , and in many other orthodox countries it seems . 
  if a country with almost 4 times less population and almost 5 times less land mass can produce enough to cover greek needs it would be a modern miracle of economics . 
  only stupid romantics want a city which has less than 2000 greeks remaining , back , to take the city back would mean war , and we have already passed through a similar phase in 21 ' with deep consequences for us . 
  so no , whats done is done , we can always play with the turks on the name of the city but to take the city back ? 
  that age has passed , and no silly prophecies or neo extreme nationalism will bring it back . 
  til istanbul declared independence and is now a city state . 
  apart from the fact that you have no idea how an economy works , think for a second , who is the biggest economy on the balkans ? 
  yeah us , who has the largest investments in the balkans ? 
  yeah greece , so if we collapse , romania , bulgaria , fyrom will be in serious shit aswell . 
  but yeah revenge economics 101 by szkwarek , please dont follow a career on the financial sector . 
  you generalize , and also cutting 70 % wages and pensions in our cost of living ( i know you arent an economist but you are at least smart enough to understand that the price of goods in greece is vastly higher here than on bulgaria or on the ex-communist countries ) would mean simply collapse of the economy . 
  unless we also have a 70 % deflation , which is not gon na happen , but hur dur i ar an economist , cut pensions . 
  the truth is simple , apollo missions were a ruse by usa and greece to built a secret base and scheme world domination . 
  but someone had to laundry the funds necessary , so greece took the bullet and overdebt itself so that the construction would continue unnoticed . 
  why do you think that greece has a space program ? 
  the usa embassy in athens is actually the tip of a giant underground research facility built during the so called metro expansions . 
  but wait there is more , the 1687 parthenon explosion was in fact an inside job , jet fuel cant melt parthenon marble . 
  dont generalize , also the 50 % cut mostly affected greek banks/pension holders and private investors . 
  most of us here aknoweledge our faults but also getting pissed at generalizations of the bild mentality and plain people that just hate greece like masquechatice below . 
  i have no idea what the source uses for the 6.14 euros per second , possibly it disregardes installments payments and instead calculates a value based on a budget absolute income per second . 
  so greece income per second-greece internal expenses = whats left is used to repay the debt per second . 
  half a million per day , around 200mil per year , at 317 billion debt , it would take us 1585 years to repay . 
  i dont think you realize how tough life is on winter on the islands ( also reminder greece isnt on tropics , winters are rough , not sweden rough , but still rough ), 
  i swear the title was different . 
  the problem is that greece for instance cant simply handle the tens of thousands of migrants/refugees and if we start stopping the boats we will be violating eu/un treaties . 
  11th century . 
  and thats a huge discussion which as a greek i would be stepping into a huge minefield . 
  well geographically speaking they are , and their largest city is also on european soil . 
  it was imf that didnt agree on the military cuts , not germany . 
  also germany buthurt about ww2 ? 
  what are they , 10 year olds ? 
  `` failure to reach an agreement would , on the contrary , mark the beginning of a painful course that would lead initially to a greek default and ultimately to the country 's exit from the euro area and -- most likely -- from the european union , '' the bank said in a statement wednesday . 
  clickbaiting, 
  but most of those migrants want to go to said northern states , so it is a collective problem . 
  whats with german corporations and greek corruption ? 
  first siemens costing us around 15 billion , now bayer . 
  it is spoken in a small gaul village in armorica ( brittany ) , its inhabitants have resisted the roman occupation using a secret magic potion . 
  as a result 4 roman forts were erected to guard and ever remain vigilant to occupy the stubborn little village . 
  i am sure you know much better as you live there , but the dutch people i have met in greece speak along with the nordic countries the most perfect english , both accent wise and vocabulary wise . 
  glory to the baguette guild , protect the wine and the cheese . 
  i hope the satelite cascade destruction doesnt happen or we risk being trapped on earth we how much clutter we put up there . 
  how come , i am more surprised with uk , considering that by 1945 the manpower was reduced immensely after 6 years of constant warfare ( though its possible this stat isnt calculated based on the british empire total population ) . 
  france although had a huge resistance movement , didnt lose a lot of troops in the initial fighting or on the free french units throughout the war . 
  also in france the jew survival rate was at 75 % . 
  i wont argue on how bad the exploitation of our only 2 major plains are ( we are mostly mountainous ) , but you cant just deflate the whole economy . 
  i have no idea what you mean by oil , do you mean crude ? 
  because we are running a serious trade deficit there and our extractions is miniscule to imports . 
  our farmers are some of the most idiotic people alive , wasted money and resources cultivating worthless stuff most of the time . 
  i understand why you feel angry on your country paying for us staying afloat and if you had look my posts you would know that i am a stern believer in staying in eurozone , paying our debts . 
  i have said many times that we should cut on military spending ( that was the proposal that imf torpedoed btw ) instead of the already lowered pensions . 
  and whats the cost of living in estonia ? 
  i bet signifant lower than in greece , if you can live with estonia minimum wage in greece , by all means go for it , dont compare uneven situations , and i have posted multiple times of greece fundamental issues . 
  we never stopped paying our debts , acting responsibly on elections , whats thats supposed to mean , vote the previous corrupt governments or not vote the current amateur ones . 
  most people in greece want to stay in euro no matter the measures ( most polls say that anyway ) , so they are willing to accept 1 if it comes down to it . 
  o i wont disagree , i just feel we enter a new age of uncertainty . 
  as my mother is from nantes its extremely sad to see this amazing arhitecture church on fire , i hope the firefighters will manage to contain the fire damage . 
  well they are in correlation with the cost of living ... ( and stop playing that pension broken tape , they have been reduced more than 40 % while the gdp drop 30 % ), 
  well lets hope it stays that way , a potential ww3 or nuclear war would amount to billions dead . 
  i dont think anyone doubts that greece is in crisis is almost entirely our fault , now how we handled that crisis since 2010 , i think both greece and creditors made errors . 
  you have no idea how greek economy works do you ? 
  default and devaluation , and you base that on what ? 
  if you have taken a minute to search the actual greek export/import figures you would know that leaving euro is almost equal to suicide , but hur dur reddit economists , devaluate go to drachma . 
  banks are kept afloat through ecb , a default would lead to a bank run almost 100 % , capital controls would only stave the inevitable . 
  exports/imports , greece highest exports are refined petroleum products , with a 8billion deficit on crude oil imports , internal industry mostly non-existant , huge imports for almost anything . 
  capital doesnt exist to create an interior industry to cover internal needs nor anyone would be willing to invest on a post-euro greece . 
  even if we become no1 tourist destination in the world , the economy would still be in chaos . 
  armchair economists . 
  i dont know man , ukraine , middle east , granted it isnt ww2 yet , but tensions are rising . 
  i dont know really , a nuclear state falling into anarchy again could lead from civil wars to a nuclear fallout . 
  ( we humans arent exactly rational beings lately ), 
  i am curious btw , whats the cost of production in alloys for the 1c and 2c coins . 
  terrible article . 
  greece economy is 3/4 domestic ? 
  what economic data did the author used , because last time i checked we run a heavy trade deficit economy with highly dependant on euro imports . 
  not to mention that most banks only have sufficient liquidity through the ecb , does the author believe that if we default , ecb will continue to inject money on greek banks ? 
  i am sure the figure means what it costs tax wise per capita . 
  edit , i am kinda confused what the second 300 euroes figure mean , also sorry if i mislead baguette but you dont get tax deduct for being in the army , i thought you meant if they have to pay 300 euros to the state , like a support tax but thats not the case . 
  essentially if you were insured for lets say 10 years on one pension fund and 30 on another ( we had ten + different pension funds for different professions/sectors ) you will get far less money than lets say being insured for 40 years on one pension ( so the money on multiple pensions is really bad ) .

rural areas always have problems with crime . 
  in fact , there was an attempted break-in in my home a few months ago while i was inside , and there have been several in my neighborhood . 
  people have been injured and one old man was killed . 
  the police needs at least 15 minutes to reach us , and in a home invasion , the outcome is determined in seconds . 
  so excuse me if i want a fighting chance against professional robbers . 
  excuse me for not wanting to be killed by taking on a 6 ' 4 ex-con with a kitchen knife . 
  guns are the great equalizer that lets the weakest of us take on the toughest criminals . 
  ` masculinity porn ' is just a useless appeal to emotion . 
  demanding to be allowed to defend one 's self in the terrible event of a home invasion is n't some macho display , it is a real concern that will exist for as long as law enforcement does n't have 30 second reaction times or teleporters . 
  itt : defending one 's family from home invaders is not a legitimate purpose . 
  you consider individuals expendable , then ? 
  should people not have a right to defend themselves ? 
  they voted not to though , their government just ignored them . 
  and that 's without bringing up just how ** stupid ** this law is in the first place , how tiny of an effect it will have on criminals while severely impacting lawful citizens , and how absolutely atrocious it is that the eu is trying to force-feed its nanny-state policies through what was supposed to be an economic union . 
  sometimes i think that everyone in europe has lost their minds and switzerland ( and liechtenstein , but it 's tiny ) is the only bastion of hope for sanity . 
  do n't like it , too bad ? 
  holy fuck , i am generally favorable to the eu , but it is stuff like this that makes me bring the whole corrupt nanny state down . 
  i really hope that switzerland decides to leave all of this crap `` daddy eu knows best '' crap and keep their dedication to liberty and privacy . 
  the reason we do n't have political stability like the us is that the executive and legislative branches are synonymous . 
  we ( sadly ) do n't hold separate elections for them . 
  i do n't get that either . 
  these people should be represented . 
  i do n't see many libertarians hanging around in / r/europe . 
  i would love to move to liechtenstein as well , but admittedly , things are easier because i have a eu passport . 
  you are absolutely right , and the reason for our failings is our socialist populist governments . 
  balkan and former ussr nations got their fix of communism , they rejected it for the sham it is , and now they are accelerating towards a freer , better future . 
  in the meantime , greeks believe that they can bring money into existence out of nothing simply because the god of socialism wills it . 
  unemployment and high costs of living are a direct result of insane labor regulations and devastating taxation that has driven business out of the country . 
  we need to be hammered into not being a socialist failed state . 
  there really is no other way to fix a country that keeps voting in the most awful populist governments and expects money to grow on trees . 
  i would love it if european technocrats took over to be honest . 
  the cancer of greek socialist politics can not be defeated without external aid . 
  we had exams today ( auth ) . 
  people were grilling a few meters away from the lecture hall . 
  it was maddening . 
  the translation that u/brigandiner posted is right on point . 
  my country 's fiscal problems are almost strictly internal and the result of decades of left wing populism , not some evil european plot . 
  the only thing that has kept us from becoming a socialist shithole like a venezuela 2.0 is the eu and the imf . 
  yeah , i derped there . 
  classical liberals are liberal socially and conservative fiscally , i was just thinking liberal = pro freedom . 
  classical liberals are both socially and fiscally liberal . 
  why would you support this insane system that treats people like pawns to be used on a chessboard ? 
  that 's just temporary excel tricks that our government does to get the numbers up , it is not sustainable . 
  all businesses were forced to pay not only this year 's taxes , but next year 's in advance as well , so the numbers look neat on the books but will plummet in the next fiscal year . 
  the middle class is being ransacked to prop up the bankrupt social welfare system . 
  it 's a ponzi scheme , and nobody wants to take the political cost of telling it as it is . 
  i am down to hoping that the conservative government that will inevitably follow this ` real socialism ' trainwreck will actually follow through with its claims of being fiscally conservative , but i sincerely doubt they will do what needs to be done . 
  we need europe to save us from ourselves . 
  sadly , there is a huge disconnect between what europe/the imf/etc . 
  want us to do , and what our governments actually do . 
  the measures that they told us to follow would have been amazing , liberalizing our soviet-esque economy and cutting taxes across the board to let the market flourish , but our politicians decided to offer equivalent tax increases instead . 
  you are right . 
  we need privatization . 
  we need to tie pensions to pension fund contributions , since almost everyone on pension gets more out of the system than they put in - and the cost is passed on to taxpayers , closing down businesses and impoverishing everyone else . 
  but if we leave the euro , greece will be left at the mercy of its socialism-dominated politics , to become another failed state like so many ssrs before it . 
  we need to stay in the euro so smarter people ( read : not greek politicians ) can use it as leverage to force us to reform . 
  even if greece 's debts were all forgiven tomorrow , no strings attached , we would still end up in a bottomless pit within a generation . 
  the only way anyone gets elected is if they give out free money , and since we do n't have the industry to support that ( hint : taxation and a sprawling bureaucracy chased them away ) , we are forced to borrow . 
  defaulting will solve nothing . 
  the situation in greece is not the eu 's fault . 
  it 's the result of decades of populist pandering and the buying of voters through giving out money that was meant to be used to build infrastructure . 
  nd disappointed me after mitsotakis ( junior ? ), 
  took over , to be honest . 
  i expected a far more radical ousting of the statist elements and some bold libertarian policies , like those his father had tried to enforce , but i guess that would be political suicide . 
  drassi joining up is a good sign though . 
  i 'm less worried about syriza being ousted ( none of the polls seem to give those charlatans any time in the sun ) and more about nd doing the right thing for once . 
  hey , i classify as an ` anarchowhatever ' , although on the other ( far , far , far other ) end of the spectrum . 
  i guess i 'm an extreme libertarian . 
  i still hold my nose and vote for nd when election time comes around , although recreate greece looked awfully appealing in the last elections . 
  which university do you study at , if i may ask ? 
  i 'm in auth , and between the drug addicts roaming the campus and the leftist fascists ruining everything , it 's been an insane experience . 
  it 's refreshing to see a fellow greek libertarian ( i assume ? ) . 
  three years in university , and i have only met a handful . 
  privatization is only a disaster when it is performed in the same fashion as the public sector : with corruption . 
  when privatization was performed properly and was accompanied by political reform ( like in the uk under thatcher ) , it had a major positive effect in both the service itself and the economy . 
  it is only in cases like the former ussr that privatization went foul , and even then , several pieces of literature suggest that things would be * worse * without the privatization . 
  in our case , the privatization should be accompanied by legal reform to allow businesses to operate profitably without resorting to corruption , and a long moratorium on further upward meddling with taxation rates and regulations . 
  and of course , no government granted monopolies , like the stranglehold oasth has in thessaloniki . 
  it does n't count as privatization if it does n't play by the rules of the free market . 
  what we should be moving towards is the example of switzerland or liechtenstein . 
  or estonia , that 's probably a closest comparison . 
  forgot to add it at first . 
  spending cuts were made in the wrong sectors . 
  the biggest problem is our redistributory pension and social welfare system , which sucks a very meaningful percentage of our gdp and pays out pensions that the contributions almost never paid for . 
  the first measure that we should have taken is burning the redistribution system into the ground and replacing it with a ` what you pay is what you get ' that only guarantees a minimum living pension . 
  that would have kept the funds solvent , and it would have prevented the continuing strangulation of our already overmilked private sector . 
  the public sector should be next , where major cuts in staffing must be made . 
  i said it in a comment above , but having seen how the inside of several public services works , 90 % of their jobs could be automated using cheap it replacements . 
  the rest should be meticulously and continuously assessed by both internal and external assessors ( including from equivalent european services ) . 
  operate the public sector like a damn corporation , kick out ineffective employees and hire those with the actual skills for the job . 
  so far , the government has done almost nothing that europe and the imf recommended , instead offering absurd compensatory taxation policies that do n't affect its loyal base of leeches . 
  private enterprise is treated like a crime in our miniature greek ssr , and eventually , the last ` suckers ' will pack up and let the whole thing crash and burn by its own insolvency . 
  i ca n't wait to leave this nightmare . 
  no , most of it goes towards our piece-of-crap social `` security '' and `` welfare '' system , the rest is eaten up by a gluttonous and useless public sector that could be slashed to 10 % simply by replacing most of the offices with internet services . 
  we * should * have absolutely butchered our public sector and privatized anything that we could , but that does n't make for a nice election bite . 
  instead , the state keeps milking businesses and europe to keep its partisan voter army going . 
  you either mistake ` rights ' with ` guarantees ' , or you have a hopelessly nihilist attitude about that world that i ca n't do anything about . 
  you ca n't just dismiss thousands of years of dialectic and philosophical debate about the nature of social norms and rights as ` male ego ' . 
  what are you even talking about . 
  '' . . originating from man 's right to own his own body ... '' explicitly excludes slavery .

  the fact that politicians can steal millions , get sentenced to life in prison ( a luxurious cell ) and then get out two years later , due to `` health problems '' , while the people can lose their house if they owe 500 euros of taxes ( because they simply did n't have the money to pay ) shows that what we have is not a democracy . 
  when an old man who sells chestnuts in the streets , to make a living and feed his family , is beaten and arrested by the police because he sold them without a tax , while rich businessmen owe millions and nobody does anything to them , you can be sure , democracy is dead . 
  and as long as the thing called `` parliamentary immunity '' exists , i do n't know how you can say that `` our democracy works '' . 
   take mitsotakis for instance . 
  before politics he was working in the baking sector . 
  filthy rich . 
  in politics he loses money . 
  how does even your argument make sense ? 
  it 's you that should take him as an example . 
  an example of a man who is in politics , whose father was in politics , whose sister is in politics , whose great-uncle was in politics , whose nephew is in politics and i do n't know if i forgot someone . 
  i wo n't be surprised if his children also get in politics . 
  it 's a big business , after all , right ? 
  i do n't know about his baking career . 
  i know he was a member of the parliament . 
  and he aspired to become a prime minister , where he will get payed even more ( a.k.a. 
  we , the poor people will pay him even more . 
  him and his family ) . 
  you said he is filthy rich . 
  he 's both . 
  but he wants more . 
   it affects you because spheres of influences affect you . 
  when the balkans were under soviet control greece was the only country together with turkey in the region that matters to the us . 
  that gave us geopolitical importance . 
  we had money , weapons , alliances . 
  when the soviet union fell we lost that importance and the us found other allies in albania and bulgaria . 
  since the geopolitical theatre has shifted towards the middle east we ca n't afford to deal with a silly state such as the one in the north . 
  so , you 're telling me that we were a good american protectorate , until they dissed us for albania and bulgaria ? 
  now we are a moderate american protectorate ? 
  why is this a good thing ? 
   nato is importance because it secures our defence via article 5 . 
  it is a collective defence pact . 
  defence against whom ? 
   eu is importance because through it we secure the balkans when they join the union . 
  what does that even mean ? 
   we get funding to reform our state . 
  looks like that did n't work very well ...  we safeguard our individual rights in the european courts when our courts fail . 
  interesting ... because it looks like `` the citizens ' rights will be breached in the name of an expanded europe '' . 
  that 's what the former president agreed with . 
   we get to have a voice and a vote in matters that affect the region . 
  when was the last time your voice was heard ? 
   we have changed several governments since the 90s no . 
  we 've had the same government since way before the 90s . 
  but this same government has changed a lot of names and faces . 
   sources you ca n't keep making nothing but mistakes for decades . 
  take the alleged `` debt '' that greece supposedly owes . 
  there have been austerity measures for almost 10 years now . 
  poverty is off the charts . 
  thousands of people have taken their lives . 
  why ? 
  because pensions and wages have been cut and taxes have increased dramatically . 
  but you know what else has increased ? 
  this `` debt '' . 
  so either the politicians are too dense to realise that their policy is not working , or they actually do these things on purpose . 
  given the fact that they 're having fun and they live in luxury , with no wage cuts , while the people suffer , i think it 's the second . 
  also , what are the odds that all the governments we 've had over the last years were made up of foolish politicians ? 
  none . 
  what are the odds that they were all made up of traitors ? 
  i leave that up to you decide . 
   you are free to vote for whoever you want . 
  even for fringe political parties . 
  no one is stopping you . 
  i think you missed my point . 
  all political parties have the same interests . 
  and those interests are not greek . 
   we do n't live in a shady dictatorship . 
  that 's debatable . 
   you always have to vote for the guy that will navigate you through current times the best . 
  pms come and go . 
  no guy will do that . 
  no woman , either . 
  pms come and go , yes . 
  and they get paid a lot in the process . 
  and after the process , too . 
   the easiness with which you said `` let them go under russian influence '' indicated russophilia and only gd voters and members are advocating for such lunacy . 
  ca n't blame me for assuming that i guess . 
  i have nothing against the russians , but i do n't like their government , if that 's what you mean . 
  the point was that i do n't care if the vardarskans are under russian influence . 
  it does n't affect me . 
  if they want to be , let them be . 
   the eu is important for the forseeable future , but not as important as nato . 
  why is either of these things important ? 
  the past is over . 
  the past is over , yes . 
  but the present is no different than the past . 
  same government . 
   mistakes were made . 
  no one argues about that . 
  the government made no mistakes . 
  everything they did , they did it on purpose . 
   we have a real government . 
  a bad one in my opinion . 
  but they are the ones in charge because they were voted in by other greeks . 
  voted in ? 
  first of all , the people are told to choose one party out of several . 
  but all the parties are basically the same . 
  owned by the same people , serving the same interests . 
  so , it does n't really matter which one you chose . 
  some will destroy you in a left way , some in a right . 
  besides , do n't forget that the results can be rigged . 
  the votes are always counted and presented by the same non-greek agency every time .

  yeah ionians and dorians were blue eyed blond germans , egyptian must have been swedes and mayans surely were finns . 
  and we are bastards that keep destroying europe . 
  this is not bild , and these are not bild readers . 
  for people like me that love germany and have many good german friends it has become more and more difficult to not be angry : first we were a nation of lies , then a nation of scum , a nation of lazybones and now bastards . 
  i am truly sorry for germany . 
  yes i am disgusted . 
  personally - and i am not at all a tsipras voter - i came to hope that tipras and his idiot buddy varoufakis wo n't accept any deal . 
  not at all for the reasons they think it is good . 
  no i do n't want to be part of the ez and eu anymore . 
  we will bleed , many will die but eventually we will come around . 
  i tend to agree my friend . 
  better outside of ez and eu . 
  in order to keep the same fragile ethnic make up as yours , do you know how many immigrants should stay in greece ? 
  about 7500 . 
  to be at your level . 
  do you know how many are here ? 
  you dont wan na know . 
  i am not that optimistic my friend . 
  not only about the ability/will of the us and uk to help but also very much affraid the consequences it will have to the population here . 
  i am very much affraid that extremists will rise and logic will go out of the window . 
  you see it 's not only the economic hardships we are facing . 
  it is the constant humiliations too . 
  to get an idea , only yesterday this was published in die welt . 
  besides on being scientificaly totaly wrong it 's not only a grave insult to us but also on the verge of explaining our problems through genetics . 
  rings a bell when it comes from german mouths ? 
  http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2015-06-14/merkel-mouthpiece-die-welt-suggests-dna-based-eu-membership-greeks-are-not-real-gree disgusted . 
  edit : some not only want us out of the ez and eu , they want us to hate it too . 
  well as i recall it , the moment a few hundred ( or even less ) people started to shoot , europe was keen to take sides and send airplanes to `` help '' the revolters . 
  now there is a lybian government that doesnt/cant control the country and an isis state on the happening . 
  talking about potato level stupidity . 
  agree . 
  but it wasnt europe 's politicians job to get rid of gaddafi too . 
  was it ? 
  as much as a prick gaddafi was , this didnt happen during his day . 
  also not as many people died per year due to gaddafi 's regime than those drowing in the med . 
  so i 'm all for stopping the flow of immigrants to europe . 
  who will do it ? 
  africans ? 
  italy ? 
  greece ? 
  the whole eu together ? 
  and how ? 
  it is very easy to be judgmental and dismissive . 
  what is the solution though ? 
  that is very likely . 
  and if that happened it will push greece towards russia etc. 
  dont want to think about it ... but if it happens , how it would be `` the best outcome for western geopolitics ... 
  it will . 
  not that this would stop varoufakis or the troika . 
  i believe it is . 
  or it could be latvia . 
  it 's not clear nowadays . 
  it would be funny if it werent tragic . 
  we are certainly together when it come to this mentality : everyone on his/her own . 
  sure !, 
  everything helps !, 
  :d lol, 
  imo the imf is the only reasonable creditor atm : http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/06/12/us-eurozone-greece-imf-iduskbn0os1yv20150612, 
   so you 're telling me , you do n't think a large chunk of the greek population is somewhat responsible for the debt crisis ... ffs where did i say anything remotely like this ? 
  i am not telling you anything more that you created a troll account cause you want to troll with out being spotted . 
  here , you say it yourself ( once again ) :  `` not really , just did n't want my account to be associated with what i said '' so dont make assumptions on who i regard responsible for the crisis cause i 've never said anything about that to you . 
  the only thing i 've said is that you definetely are a fucking troll . 
  and no one in his right mind would open a discussion with a troll . 
  idiot . 
  true !, 
  and also the imf asks for a debt relief something that is never mentioned by the creditors . 
  http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/06/12/eurozone-greece-imf-idusl5n0yy2a720150612 so no , imf is not angry only with the greeks it is also with the creditors . 
  half truth is not truth . 
  throwaway account = troll thank you for admitting it so easily sweetie pie !, 
  only here to unload venom !, 
  not only a troll but stupid as potato , for not thinking we 'd notice !, 
  huh !, 
  yes . 
  it 's the evil imf , now that does n't agree on military cuts . 
  no mention at all that the imf at the same time asks for debt cut . 
  very odd !, 
  oh really ? 
  not a 1st post then ? 
  not a nickname picked up just for the occasion ? 
  also , never commented about your ancestry or nationality ... just the trolling nature of yours !, 
  interesting choice of nickname dude !, 
  and what 's even more interesting is that this is your 1st and only post . 
  proper trolling needs more wits than that honey bunny !, 
   the debt it self never goes down only the gdp rises and so the debt/gdp ratio got better . 
  true !, 
  and our gdp fell by 30 % the last few years as a result of implementing the troika plans . 
  we are being asked to continue on the same path . 
   the nazi 's did n't manage that while they occupied greece . 
  under german occupation it was n't just the firing squads and burning of whole villages , they destroyed the economy so bad that there were 100s of thousands deaths from starvation . 
  at the time of the german occupation the city of athens had an every day service for collecting from the streets the bodies of those that died of starvation . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/great_famine_ ( greece ) so to say * `` the nazi 's did n't manage that while they occupied greece '' * is simply wrong . 
  here too the imf intervention would be successful , if the imf intervention were followed . 
  not really . 
  read this please : http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/06/12/eurozone-greece-imf-idusl5n0yy2a720150612 you 'll find out that everyone looks bad , but the creditors . 
  the imf is also asking for a debt relief for years now . 
  in that regard , the imf is the only one who tells the truth both to greece and its creditors . 
  they wo n't accept anything other than pension system reform but at the same time say that the plans are not sustainable if a debt cut wo n't happen . 
  hardly at fault imo . 
  `` but by mentioning financing , the imf also wanted to signal is exasperation at european governments ' refusal to discuss debt relief for greece , without which imf officials say the country 's finances simply wo n't be sustainable . '', 
  impossible .

  it later became universal rts language . 
  i believe it was a review commission after the invasion and the info given by the republic of cyprus has to do with events during the invasion . 
   no answer so i am going to assume i was at the gym working out . 
  ca n't answer 24/7 . 
  there is no cyprus civil war . 
  the crisis of the late 50s involves the legal republic of cyprus and and pro-taksim turks . 
  i am talking about the akinci erdogan relationship at the time . 
  talks where reignited in 2014 . 
  of course the problems goes further back . 
  you are right . 
  i was thinking of the eu negotiations and deals alterations for the move in order to join the eu . 
  different admins, 
   greeks wanted enosis . 
  turks responded . 
  so if albanians ever try to annex kosovo serbia and other neightbors should respond accordingly ? 
   i think the solution is quite simple . 
  i do n't think it is . 
  ~ ~ erdogan ~ ~ akinci and anastasiades ca n't agree on the maps . 
  the european commission of human rights found turks guilty of rapes , death squads etc. 
  twelve to one the evidence provided by the roc were accepted . 
   after greek coup d'etat which aimed the annexation of the island to greece . 
  it was n't of the greek colonel regime that wanted enosis . 
  enosis was being a thing ever since the dawn of time . 
  even before the colonels . 
   what turkey did wrong was making a 2nd military operation we are talking about the invasion of 1974 . 
  prior events are a thread of their own . 
   turkey could support statue quo and it could de facto control the north of island until we come up with a solution recent talks did n't go well sadly . 
  let 's hope that the ongoing negotiations will have some actual results . 
  fixed it . 
  thanks !, 
  that is actually awesome . 
  the more i read about the baltics the more interesting it becomes . 
  tl ; dr/eli5 : the military junta in mainland greece wanted to stage a coup in order to overthrow the head of the republic of cyprus which was seen by the americans as the `` fidel castro of the mediterranean '' . 
  he was pro-enosis and then he was n't and then he was and then he was n't . 
  that would help make the enosis efforts faster . 
  ** enosis was a movement by greeks living both in mainland greece and cyprus in order to unite the two states into one . 
  ** while this was happening the turks on the island were having brutal fights with the local greeks . 
  both sides being extremelly brutal . 
  the turkish government pulled a putin/crimea and said `` we have to protect turks living in cyrpus from the coup '' . 
  they invaded the island and relocated thousands of turks there in order to turkify the northern parts . 
  they destroyed churches and property in order to battle greek influence there . 
  even to this day ** the pseudostate at the north is not recognized by any country in the un except from turkey ** . 
  the occupation is viewed as illegal under international law , amounting to illegal occupation of european union territory since cyprus became its member . 
  the island [ before ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3c/ethnographic_distribution_in_cyprus_1960.jpg ) the invasion . 
  edit : * general info * many notable people including late christopher hitchens suggest that henry kissinger should be held accountable for the invasion . 
  many years after the invasion during a protest against the illegal state at the north , turkish nationalist killed a young 24 year greek . 
  [ pic ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f9/tasos_isaak_murdered.jpg ) . 
  when isaac was killed , he left behind his pregnant wife . 
  as a token of gratitude for his `` services '' to greece , the greek government decided to be the godparent of the yet unborn baby . 
  when the baby girl was born , she was baptised anastasia ( after her father ) by the then greek minister of foreign affairs theodoros pangalos . 
  three days later an angry for the previous event 26 year old greek tried to take the turkish flag down behind some un soldiers . 
  a turk shot him dead . 
  [ video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iutex6vne4c#t=00m46s ) . 
  * the perpetrators was later released by the turkish authorities despite being wanted for murder by interpol * after the invasion the us imposed an arms embargo on turkey and the roc . 
  in 2005 , the us passed a bill which allowed the sales of defence articles to the republic of cyprus under conditions . 
  i 've played countless hours of c&c . definitely on my top 3 if we are talking about hours ~ ~ weeks , months , years ~ ~ spent . 
  i ca n't really describe it . 
  it comes from experience mostly . 
  it is mostly facial features rather than the eyes for me . 
   maybe they are closer to ancient illyrians albanoi was just an illyrian tribe . 
  generalizing every tribe of that area are illyrian was an ancient greek mistake . 
  they wrongly called everyone in the area as illyrian just because of the difference in language . 
  the illyrians were probably not homogenous . 
  there was a period were we used to consider venetic tribes illyrian . 
  language wise there is no connection . 
  recent studies from vienna show that there is no connection between albanian and illyrian . 
  we hear of albanians as albanians the first time during the 12-14th century . 
  in the 18th century the connection between illyrians and albanians was made for the first time . 
  there are issues with that connection though . 
  what makes more sense is that albanians were a unique tribe living between illyrians and thracians , probably with a connection to some subillyrian tribe , that survived in isolation in the western balkans being surrounded by other tribes and people . 
  this is were the warrior ethos of the albanians comes from . 
  after skanderbeg they got into the game full time as a western people thinking themselves as part of the roman/byzantine mechanism . 
  hence the double headed eagle that was used by many albanian families at the time . 
   the average albanian is very easily distinguished from the average greek at the moment depends on the albanian . 
  i can tell most albanians by their face but there are other albanians that are indistinguishable from greeks . 
  my best friend growing up was an albanian . 
  you could not tell that he was one . 
  you can easily distinguish albanians that came from northern albania though . 
  they bring some really old time conservative customs with them . 
  an albanian family that lives a couple of blocks from my house lives like they are preparing for nuclear fallout . 
  they constantly repair and rebuild their house , tools everywhere , slav squat 'd dinner time at the porch , parts of machines and bikes and cars hoarding etc. 
  [ here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1n5acb32ak ) is a good piece with many albanians that used to live in greece . 
  you can hardly tell them from greeks . 
  definitely not civic nationalists . 
  racial ultranationalists for sure . 
  greece is spamming battle tanks for a rush . 
  command and conquer pros . 
  nerf zerg rush . 
  genetics is not lunacy . 
  ultranationalists thinking that genetics determines their destiny is lunacy . 
   unite once and for all , be happy . 
  we live with albanians in greece . 
  they are the biggest minority . 
  where i live in ~ ~ actual greek ~ ~ macedonia , albanians are all over the place . 
  we work with them , we eat with them , we joke with them . 
  greece has been open to albanians ever since the fall of their socialist regime . 
  the only people who have problems with them are either far right ultranationalists or left wing socialist who keep think that albanians are nato shills . 
  greeks and albanians are extremelly close genetically speaking . 
  and that is a fact that triggers greek and albanian nationalists . 
  this has nothing to do with what i am saying .

  democrats trying to appeal to republicans and vise versa . 
  take a look at most republican presidents . 
  eisenhower , ford , bush41 etc. 
  most of them are moderates . 
  same goes for the democrats . 
  clinton was a moderate . 
  and even back in time . 
  fdr was not far away ideologically from many republicans of his time like charles evans hughes for instance . 
  you need to look at the bigger picture . 
  trump in not the norm in us politics . 
  he is just a phenomenon of our times but not of the us tradition in general, 
   therefore they tend to implement laws that help all of society and not just a few . 
  so you imply what i accused you of implying . 
  that rightists do n't pass laws that help everyone . 
  and they do that because of ... reasons ? 
   without voltaire , kant or hume we would n't have separation of state and religion , freedom of expression and probably no democracy . 
  this has nothing to do with my question . 
  but since you made the case you should know that people like hume would n't be considered `` left '' . 
  his work was banned in the us for being too `` tory '', 
  the more you study us history the more you understand that the american political system is way more centrist than the european one . 
  the two party system breeds the center . 
  democrats trying to appeal to republicans and vise versa . 
  take a look at most republican presidents . 
  eisenhower , ford , bush41 etc. 
  most of them are moderates . 
  same goes for the democrats . 
  clinton was a moderate . 
  and even back in time . 
  fdr was not far away ideologically from many republicans of his time like charles evans hughes for instance . 
  you could say the same happens in canada too . 
  liberals and conservatives fuel the center . 
  in europe though we have more extreme parties . 
  far right fascists , far left socialists , communists etc. 
  i do n't think these are progressive tendencies . 
  what you consider fringe in the us has seats in european parliaments . 
  now why does this happen ? 
  this needs a book to be answered because the answer goes way back and requires the examination of many events . 
  i find the american political tradition more * moderate * , more * effective * and more * stable * . 
  are you implying that the more educated someone is the more left wing he becomes ? 
  i do n't have any up to date polling numbers but we know what the french voted for in the past . 
  for the maastricht treaty 51 % against the eu constitution 55 %, 
   al-hamamy 's uncle , riyad al - refaai , said : `` i find it incomprehensible that a young man on his way to commit a terrorist act only has a knife with him . 
  if you tell me he had a gun , a rifle , then yes , i 'd believe you , but i do n't know ... all we want is the truth , '' he said . 
   the father of the machete-wielding man who was shot by a guard as he tried to enter paris 's louvre museum said on saturday his son was not an islamist and the french were only accusing him of terrorism to excuse the brutality used to stop him . 
  they are in denial, 
  so new zealand and ireland are the only anglosphere countries not considered an ally ? 
  interesting, 
  `` because of reasons '' is not an argument  under sharia , it 's technically impossible to be autocrat is n't sharia a theocracy ? 
  which is ... religious autocracy ? 
  they are . 
  but it is not the normal state . 
  take the us for instance . 
  they have been a country since 1776 . 
  they never had a dictator . 
  look at canada . 
  look at the uk . 
  even countries that had autocracy ( like spain or germany ) eventually moved towards more liberal institution because of the the specific traditions i am talking about . 
  to make a comparison take a look at russia . 
  a european country with strong autocratic traditions . 
  i do n't understand what exactly is your objection to my claim that decentralization of powers is a western trait, 
  the seven year dictatorship in greece or hitler in germany were just a hiccup of autocracy in a mainly democratic journey feel free to read about the early constitution of greece that was devised under anastasios polyzoidis . 
  radical and democratic even for its time . 
  i am not aware of the history of every single nation in the world and to make such claim would be foolish . 
  i know for sure though that liberal institutions are no foreign institutions to the west . 
  on the other hand non-western cultures have proven to be prone to autocracy, 
  seperation of powers ** is ** western and liberal . 
  aristotle to john calvin to lord acton . 
  this is tradition . 
  some countries may have today seperation of powers but it is not a tradition for them . 
  and tradition matters when it comes to the consensus of the people, 
  i am being specific . 
  i am talking about decentralization of power . 
  which is a product of the western liberal tradition . 
  i am not using the word liberal as we use it when describing progressives, 
  i am using the word liberal in its general sense . 
  classical if you may . 
   german chancellor angela merkel paid a visit to turkey , where president recep tayyip erdo\u011fan lectured her not to use the expression `` islamist terror . ''  he said , as quoted by the website of the turkish presidency : `` the ` islamist terror ' expression gravely saddens us as muslims . 
  such an expression can not be used ; it is not right because islam and terror do n't go side by side . 
  islam literally means peace , it can not be associated with terror . 
  therefore , mentioning it side by side terror saddens adherents of this religion . '', 
  turkey is * not * a western country and it does n't have liberal traditions . 
  things like decentralization of power is a foreign concept to them . 
  throughout their history they were ruled by a sultan , a sultanite president or the army . 
   a turkish national was arrested on wednesday on suspicion of spying , greek authorities announced . 
  cengiz uyugur , 51 , who is chief engineer of a cargo ship named m/v makbule ana under a turkish flag , was arrested while taking photographs of the dockyard in salamis . 
  according to sources , the man was detected by greek navy officers , who in turn informed the coastguard of elefsina . 
  the man was taken into custody where a trial date was set by the court after his photographs were seized . 
  the greek ministry of shippuing and island policy released a statement on the incident , while a portion of the turkish media has covered the news linking it to the recent surge of provocations over the isles of imia between greece and turkey . 
   he [ turkish pm ] said . 
  `` turkey is not behaving in a way that will spoil relations with greece . '', 
   in a related development the turkish foreign ministry objected to greek media reports about an upcoming military exercise on kos , claiming that the greek island is `` demilitarized '' and that such an exercise would be illegal . 
  i first read the title . 
  i said `` good '' . 
  then i read the article ...  while thatcher is responsible for embedding conservative authoritarian values , new labour governments ` reproduced , not challenged ' the political philosophy of previous conservative governments which allowed it to be passed on to a new generation so blair and thatcher are responsible for authoritarian values in britain ? 
  what exactly did i say that makes you think of that ? 
  if they believe the opposite then why do n't they ever escort greek aircrafts out of disputes zones ? 
  it is always the greeks that escort turkish aircrafts out of these zones . 
  that should give you a hint on how the situation really is . 
   i 've been called a nazi not two days ago on here for arguing against starting a civil war in my country this is priceless, 
  let me explain how this works .

  if everybody had a balanced budget germany would be ~ ~ poor ~ ~ not as rich because it would n't export anywhere . 
  if everybody would export like germany noone would be buying their stuff . 
  a harsh economic reality is that one needs to be a looser for the other to be a winner . 
  herr sch\u00e4uble knows that , but he is on the winning side . 
  so are 80 million germans that would never admit that . 
  a good video below for german speakers . 
  worth watching even if its super long https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guvuuzzfppq, 
    comparing her pension , with the average is quiet wrong . 
  in greece there are some pensions that are  ? 
   ridicoulously high ( due to the old governments unwillingness to adjust this ) and most are really low . 
  a pension of 350 euro is very common in greece . 
  but yeah , who cares ...  my grandfather has parkinson , suffering from dementia and his pension is 80eur ; although his medicine are partly supported by his insurance , if he did n't have a family , he would probably starve to death . 
  but yeah , who cares ... 
  i am sorry to hear about your grandfather and i find this truly unjustifiable . 
  if i hear such things happening in greece , romania or moldova , i get really dissapointed of the european stance . 
  i truly wish we would all unite and fight for a better future . 
  i wish the slovakian pm would rather say `` greece fights for more , we should fight for more '' . 
  for years now we are importing german products , paying for their cars and their projects while they outsource cheap jobs to the eastern block while we outsource skilled employers to their country . 
  these articles are infuriating and really not helping the situation  vargova , who lives on a pension of 370 euros a month , while the average greek pension is 833 euros comparing her pension , with the average is quiet wrong . 
  in greece there are some pensions that are ridicoulously high ( due to the old governments unwillingness to adjust this ) and most are really low . 
  a pension of 350 euro is very common in greece . 
  but yeah , who cares ...  vargova , who retired after working for 40 years , believes it is time greeks felt some of the hardship slovaks went through when their country transformed itself from a communist economy . 
  i can understand that feeling of `` they should suffer for their decisions '' . 
  the problem is that in greece we had an infrastructure , a system that was sustained on these horrible loans we used to take . 
  now that they are gone , the whole thing is falling on our heads . 
  we are leading in unemployment and the youth is desperate . 
  we ca n't sustain the level and the economy has been crushed . 
  i feel sympathy for the former soviet blocks , but i do not think it should be a race to the bottom . 
  my problem is that greece right now has no prospects of getting better compared to the balkan countries . 
  all hope is gone for greece , yet we hear romania at al moving forward , even slowly . 
  summary stolen from the guardian :  specifically , is the euro zone 's leadership delivering the broad-based economic recovery that is needed to give stressed countries like greece a reasonable chance to meet their growth , employment , and fiscal objectives ? 
  over the longer term , these questions are evidently of far greater consequence for europe , and for the world , than are questions about whether tiny greece can meet its fiscal obligations . 
   unfortunately , the answers to these questions are also obvious . 
  since the global financial crisis , economic outcomes in the euro zone have been deeply disappointing . 
  he also points to the strength of the german economy as a problem :  nobody is suggesting that the well-known efficiency and quality of german production are anything other than good things , or that german firms should not strive to compete in export markets . 
  what is a problem , however , is that germany has effectively chosen to rely on foreign rather than domestic demand to ensure full employment at home , as shown in its extraordinarily large and persistent trade surplus , currently almost 7.5 percent of the country 's gdp . 
  within a fixed-exchange-rate system like the euro currency area , such persistent imbalances are unhealthy , reducing demand and growth in trading partners and generating potentially destabilizing financial flows . 
   ... germany could help restore balance within the eurozone and raise the currency area 's overall pace of growth by increasing spending at home , through measures like increasing investment in infrastructure , pushing for wage increases for german workers ( to raise domestic consumption ) , and engaging in structural reforms to encourage more domestic demand . 
  such measures would entail little or no short-run sacrifice for germans , and they would serve the country 's longer-term interests by reducing the risks of eventual euro breakup . 
  he concludes :  i 'll end with two concrete proposals . 
  first , negotiations over greece 's evidently unsustainable debt burden should be based on explicit assumptions about european growth . 
  if european growth turns out to be weaker than projected , which in turn would make it tougher for greece to grow , then greece should be allowed greater leeway after the fact in meeting its fiscal targets . 
   second , it 's time for the leaders of the euro zone to address the problem of large and sustained trade imbalances ( either surpluses or deficits ) , which , in a fixed-exchange-rate system like the euro zone , impose significant costs and risks . 
  for example , the stability and growth pact , which imposes rules and penalties with the goal of limiting fiscal deficits , could be extended to reference trade imbalances as well . 
  simply recognizing officially that creditor as well as debtor countries have an obligation to adjust over time ( through fiscal and structural measures , for example ) would be an important step in the right direction . 
  that all would be fine and true if : - europe wouldnt have bailed out banks in the beginning of the crisis . 
  especially german banks . 
  there was the preference of saving the banks that lend all the money to greece , rather than let them go bust like they disserve . 
  - germany wouldnt imensively profit from the current crisis ( see other article from today ) - germany 's money coming from countries that are currently in crisis . 
  a lot of the projects , if not the majority , in greece , spain , italy and portugal were made by german companies , and mostly paid with those loans those countries got . 
  so germany managed to employ a lot of people and it helped their economy - germany 's media and political propaganda wouldnt put the blame almost completely on the greek people , bending the truth to accomplish the divide and make the population rage against the greeks and push the government for hard measures - germany actively ignoring rules whenever it feels like it 's ok , but using the `` it 's an agreement '' part whenever it suits them , like the lisbon treaty . 
  and germany was at the front on this back in 2010 because of their banks . 
  - germany not even thinking about debt relief or restructuring , despite the many times they got it themselves . 
  how does this look to the general , non-german population . 
  - siemens bribary scandal in greece : http://www.spiegel.de/international/business/siemens-bribery-scandal-in-greece-ex-boss-could-help-shed-light-on-corruption-a-633198.html, 
  greece complied the last 5 years ago . 
  things got worse . 
  most blame greece for that, 
  hum ? 
  i am talking about a specific aspect : german internal politics . 
  what responsibility could the greeks have for : - the pan european neoliberal stance against left parties ? 
  - the rotten banking system - german misrepresented stories and negative , hostile articles ? 
  we bare the responsibility for our actions . 
  so do the germans and any other country, 
  the problem is that economies are competing . 
  everybody , especially germany , is talking about growth . 
  all countries need to grow over the time to remain competitive , otherwise they will stop having income . 
  and for growth you need assets . 
  if you sieze 50 billion of asssets , basically selling them off , you are also removing an opportunity from greece to get this growth . 
  if you wait 20 years , without growth , greece practically wo n't exist . 
  they wo n't be generating anything competitive , people wo n't be getting married or children and will live a miserable life . 
  with your analogy , you would take the persons valueble things away , also a part of his brain ( the braindrain ) , his leg and his one eye and expect him to go back to work . 
  that is impossible , and yeah , cruel . 
  i really doubt tsipras threatened the ez . 
  how did he do that ? 
  he doesnt have any leverage . 
  he intended to come in with some ideas to change europe and the current system that has been proven it doesnt work . 
  he failed to impress though . 
  there is no one reason why he failed though . 
  for sure , you can not just come into power and demand things . 
  from that perspective , you are right with your assemsment and ez are right to slow down tsippy . 
  but from the other side , germany and the rest of the ez did n't want tsipras . 
  they did n't want a leftist government . 
  what responded with direct humiliation ( greece doesnt have written proposals ( they lied ) , we can not negotiate properly , lack of trust circlejerk ) basically from day one . 
  to back this humiliation , german media came in and repeated the same things over and over again . 
  just look at spiegel , which used to be a great source . 
  their news items became shamelessly editorialized , calling tsipras a player or crazy . 
  the previous years they made tons of false claims and exagarations . 
  i wo n't even mention bild/welt . 
  the public opinion just did the same and now there is no way back . 
  its hard to fight against this notion now . 
  most germans think the greeks are lazy , get pensions when they are 40 and are just in to get their money . 
  even if the world shifted and merkel all of a sudden had to change her strategy to save eurozone and ... lets say ... really help and invest in greece , germans would need time to get convinced after swallowing propaganda stories for the last 6 years . 
  the damage for the next elections might be too big . 
  so we all continue with the same shit and it 's fucking depressing me, 
  and no greek would oppose those chages . 
  it 's just that we all know current measures do and will not work . 
  a * merkel plan * should be developed , greece would embrace this , we would work hard , change our cuntry , fight corruption , be a part of a well functioning eu , we would invest and develop this nation and do big endeavours with our neighbors , export and import products and grow along with the eu , generate tourism for everybody , the eu will love us and we will love the eu and we 'll all dance around the fire singing kumbaya !, 
  we greeks brought us all together < 3, 
  or the average german understand what is happening .

  probably colorblind too . 
  and mysql, 
  i 'm more impressed with sweden , they manage to attract entrepreneurs with tax rates that would be considered prohibitive . 
  the unwashed one, 
  you 're welcome . 
  i hope you enjoy all those marble copies . 
  happy birthday , former colonies !, 
  i would suggest they also force the cows to eat all the tulips before deporting them . 
  i found it on a greek site , thats probably why i posted it first . 
  i dont think such comedy gold would remain unnoticed for long . 
  that 's actually a reason not to trust scotcens . 
  academics have vested interests in post-brexit politics ( e.g. 
  eu funds directly benefit them ) . 
  explosive, 
  where do you think turkey will go if they leave nato ? 
  nobody forced this woman to work there, 
  coming soon, 
  pretty soon : `` here 's is half the parthenon frieze . 
  to see the other half , go get a visa '' . 
  imagine someone working in the tourism industry . 
  a hijab is not exactly a ` welcome ' sign . 
  religious symbols are a noticeable thing which , to me , signals that i need to be a little careful when speaking to that person . 
  with so many religions around , it 's becoming increasingly difficult to track down what 's acceptable to whom . 
  the point is that if an employer considers it important , they should be able to ban it . 
  on the other hand , there is the concern that employers who simply want to avoid hiring muslims , they will create such rules to push them away . 
  its not mandatory for everyone everywhere . 
  only if the company decides to have such rules . 
  if i employed people who interact with customers i would not want them to be so visibly separated in ` christians ' and ` muslims ' . 
  either they should all wear scarves or none . 
  the ruling makes sense for employers who do n't want no trouble . 
  on the other hand i see some problems with it : - companies that want to avoid hiring muslims can use this to keep them away - religious symbols exist in clothes etc. 
  crosses have become a fashion artifact in many cases , detached from religion . 
  could the ruling become more complicated in the future ? 
  `` i wore this cross as part of my jeans , not because i want to show my religious affiliation '' . 
  - what about tatoos ? 
  its basically the same name, 
  they should ddos the turkish airports , so no dutchmen can land . 
  and then maybe have a coup or two to celebrate . 
  it involves a lot of hyperbole , lying , smoke and mirrors , some chaos , and `` independent jouranlists '' doing nationalist propaganda . 
  they have been stirring a lot of tension with greece lately too . 
  is it serious ? 
  i doubt it . 
  does it bring any tangible results ? 
  i have no idea but also doubt it . 
  so bizarre . 
  everything lost in translation, 
  your flag is next i think, 
  imbeciles can only serve as props for outrage videos . 
  ok but there is a difference between unfavorable and hostile . 
   he vast majority to european citizens in every opinion poll on the subject over the past number of years see russia overwhelmingly as hostile maybe , but per country ? 
  source ? 
   greece received substantially more money i 'm not stating an opinion , just saying that greece didnt feel russia so much of a threat . 
  greece also opposed sanctions . 
   greek who does n't see turkey i was talking about turkey and france . 
  turkey is traditionally a threat to greece . 
  we do n't have problems with other me countries , in fact we are probably among the most friendly europeans to them . 
   think you 're attempting to drag nationality into this on a truly odious level i think you 're saying that only the northern block are allowed to have opinions . 
  you could disagree more politely . 
  and no , * you * are wrong http://www.ekathimerini.com/208607/article/ekathimerini/business/greece-capital-controls-have-silver-lining-more-tax-revenues, 
  you seem to think the status quo will never change . 
  it 's a possibility . 
  well you see ` external threats ' differ . 
  southern european countries do not all consider russia the thread that the baltic countries see . 
  during the greek crisis of 2015 , greece seeked a loan from the russians for example . 
  same with turkey or middle east . 
  is turkey or the me a threat to spain or france ? 
  i think you 've narrowed down europe to `` northern europe '', 
  in what way ? 
  extended families and communal raising of kids has been done in many societies . 
  thats the one valid argument . 
  however , starting with gay marriage , i think marriage is bound to be redefined mulitple times soon . 
  so are private jets . 
  so what ? 
  i think it 's technically polygyny . 
  are you guys opposed to polygamy ? 
  i m not . 
  i agree with your points , but i think it 's wishful thinking . 
  the more power the eu gets , the more significant the leadership and its nationality will be . 
  currently , i ca n't think of any 1 or 2 people who could legitimately compete for a european presidency with credentials . 
  it 's worse today than it was in the 80s . 
  you seem to believe in european syncretism against external enemies . 
  that would be nice , but i do n't think it exists . 
  inevitably there will be some nation behind that ` central govt ' . 
  like how germany is leading the ` anational ' eu . 
  the people of europe want to live in an american colony ( oh the irony ) in perpetuity, 
   giving up some sovereignty too to whom ? 
  i know that . 
  its you who compared it to selecting the judicial, 
  strongly disagree . 
  remove political voting from eurovision and you re left with ... san remo, 
  and what are those ? 
  an independet power , like judges ? 
  the `` european '' part is where 27 bureaucrats voted another one . 
  so now the eu is an independent executive power ? 
  it 's not complete . 
  the plan is to be completed in 2020 , if possible . 
  there are multiple issues all the time as the work progresses . 
  its a real nightmare . 
  its not surprising . 
  politics .

  kebab is that meat on the stick thing . 
  we call it souvlaki ( kalamaki in athens ) . 
  i do n't think that they serve doner in a pita with tzatziki either . 
  i know but i 'm from athens so it 's souvlaki for me :p, 
  with pork meat ? 
  highly doubt it . 
  i 'm gon na trigger a lot of people but ... that 's souvlaki not gyros !!, 
  guys you are wrong . 
  he was a pontic greek so his name is napoleontas vonapartidis . 
  do you mean nikolas teslakopoulos ? 
  the show airs every 2 mondays . 
  they said they 're gon na make it 2 weeks ago . 
  they made one for greece in monday but they have n't upload it to the official website yet . 
  but it 's on youtube : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ggg4gzgmjc, 
  you are spot on about the cram schools ( i did n't even know they are called that in english ) . 
  nowadays , they are way better than regular schools . 
  when i was in my last year of high school , most of my classmates were bringing their homework from cram school to the regular school , because they rightly thought that it was more important than the things we learned in school . 
  also , the fact that near the end of the season the students stay home to study or go to cram school instead of going to regular school ( yes this is actually a thing ) says it all . 
  i remember going to school near the end , and it was just me and 2-3 other students in the classroom . 
  and most of the times we did n't even had lessons because we were so few that the teachers most of the times allowed us to leave the classroom and go outside , go play football at the yard or even go home sometimes . 
  greece vs literally every country we border . 
  exactly that . 
  people think that because the government owes money , the whole country is poor . 
  that 's definitely not the case . 
  and even with all this debt , greece is still the wealthiest country in the balkans . 
  yes . 
  poros actually consists of 2 island . 
  the first is the one in the photo and the second is the one behind it . 
  most people live in the first island because the second is very mountainous . 
  it 's in the saronic gulf , 58km south of piraeus . 
  whenever i say that my mother is from poros , most people say '' you mean paros ? 
  there is not really much you can do/see outside of athens , thessaloniki and the islands . 
  if you are in greece to have fun , party , etc you go to these places but if you are here to see the ancient monuments , museums , etc you go to continental greece . 
  so we are not even in europe now ? 
  i was expecting a '' pay your debts '' or something like that for greece tbh . 
  that really annoy us . 
  white socks with sandals incoming !!, 
  so , how is the greek team playing if it 's the only team in the league ? 
  here in greece it is not really mentioned because nobody watches it . 
  people here call it rugby because they think that it 's the same thing ( rugby is not popular either ) . 
  that 's the best greek accent i 've heard from a non greek person . 
  obviously he ca n't talk like a native but his accent is pretty close to a native 's accent . 
  wow he speaks greek almost like a native . 
  his accent is pretty much spot on . 
  it 's probably that because there is no way nikos aliagas is the most popular person in greece . 
  because he is famous in france he has a lot of french followers so maybe that 's why . 
  but he 's not that popular here . 
  i do n't think that these numbers include illegal immigrants . 
  really ? 
  i did n't know that sweden has less population than greece and portugal . 
  i always thought that they had big population . 
  oh nice , like we did n't have enough refugees already . 
  i 'm atheist as well and although i do n't like the meaning of the cross in the flag , the flag seems really nice with it . 
  like chalkidiki , nowhere . 
  in greece is : 1 ) football . 
  we absolutely love football . 
  football is like a religion here . 
  2 ) basketball . 
  almost everybody who watches football , watches basketball as well but not as fanatically . 
  i personally find it a bit boring but i like playing it myself rather than watching . 
  3 ) it 's probably volleyball or water polo . 
  volleyball is a sport that mostly females play here . 
  it 's actually not that bad and when i was in high school i used to play when i had nothing else to do . 
  we have a pretty good national team in water polo but not a lot of people play this sport . 
  you were probably here in the summer then . 
  it even snowed in piraeus as well . 
  we do n't usually see snow in piraeus . 
  last time it snowed here was 2 years ago when it snowed for like 3-4 hours and before that it was like 8-9 years ago when the whole piraeus was covered in snow . 
  because dogtooth is weird af . 
  my favorite greek movies are sirens in the aegean and i-4 loufa kai apallagi, 
  not at all . 
  brazilians and greeks have a very good relationship actually . 
  actually basketball is the 2nd most popular sport in most european countries and especially southern european countries . 
  my grandad also helped a british soldier hide from the germans during ww2 . 
  ok , that 's it . 
  i 'm moving to vilnius asap . 
  i finished watching this video and i decided to take a look at the comments . 
  worst mistake i 've ever made ... 
  [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_greek_flags#/media/file:greek_revolution_flag.svg ) is also the flag that was used during the greek revolution of 1821 . 
  for real ? 
  is it like the slang word for face ? 
  i just googled pekin , and turns out that it 's a city in illinois . 
  i do n't think we have rakija here . 
  we have something similar in crete that is called tsikoudia . 
  edit : in wikipedia it says that rakija and raki is the same thing btw . 
  someone needs to tell ramsey to stop playing football !!, 
  i do n't know about corfu but in athens and sparta ( the 2 places i 've lived ) all the fast food stores are open for 24 hours . 
  you ca n't judge a whole country just because you visited a small island and saw a few stores closed at 9 . 
  did n't they tell you not to believe in stupid stereotypes ? 
  huh look at that . 
  the '' lazy greeks '' work more hours than everybody in europe . 
  i thought we would be higher in pork meat since gyros is life . 
  not only anatolian . 
  balkan , greek , armenian , arab , etc. 
  the j2 is not turkish , it 's greco-roman and anatolian . 
  the j2 haplogroup is from anatolians hunter gatherers that mixed with the farmers that lived in greece about 25.000 years ago . 
  it 's you that should be triggered since you 're not as turkic as you think you are . 
  i prefer chicken gyros as well but pork gyros is not bad either ( it 's actually awesome ) . 
  you gave 12 points to your neighbor ( sweden ) as well , did n't you ? 
  greece is really not that hot compared to the countries of mesopotamia .

  some say that the current one is more distinct and unique , or that it can instantly be recognised , even in black and white . 
  well , i love both flags . 
  which is why we do n't have american stripes . 
  we have greek stripes . 
  [ this ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6e/flag_of_greece_%281822-1978%29.svg/1200px-flag_of_greece_%281822-1978%29.svg.png ) is called the `` land flag '' ( the one you see in my flair was originally the naval flag ) . 
  the land flag used to be the official national flag of greece , until the naval flag took its place in the 70s . 
  it 's not as popular as the current state flag , but it is somewhat popular . 
  not among a specific part of the people . 
  8 comments so far and none of us is italian . 
  i understand what you mean . 
  no , i 'm not a white supremacist , either . 
  i find it normal for them to care about europe . 
  i find it wrong , however , to think that everyone who is against illegal immigration in europe is a white nationalist american . 
  there are many europeans who oppose it , too . 
  and we 're not all white nationalists . 
  at least i 'm not , since whites are not a nation , and as such , i think the term is wrong . 
   they claim that with the refugees going into europe that there 's a `` white genocide '' . 
  what refugees ? 
  maybe the illegal immigrants ? 
   so what exactly do y' all think about these people ? 
  are they overreacting to a problem that does n't exist ? 
  i think it 's nice that they 're interested . 
  no , they 're not overreacting to a problem that does n't exist . 
  are girlymen common in the army ? 
  the first thing they tell you is to hide under the desk , which has a metalic grid under the wood . 
  this is supposed to happen while the earth is shaking . 
  then , the whole thing is about getting out of the building without panicking . 
  this happens when the earthquake has stopped . 
  each teacher leads his/her classroom 's students to the nearest exit , according to the schools architectural plan , a copy of which exists in each room . 
  once outside , everyone is supposed to gather in a place in the schoolyard which is away from the building , in case it collapses . 
  but we 've had several drills for earthquakes . 
  the `` refugee '' crisis , because the new government in washington is not flooding my country with foreigners . 
  the subject was our views on muslims . 
  then you came along . 
   i am done with this subject though . 
  good . 
   however you keep trying to seek out who is right all in these incidents . 
  this is the wrong thing you have done in this discussion . 
  so , there are two groups of people . 
  one fights for its freedom , the other fights against the other 's freedom . 
  i think it 's clear who was right . 
   you are blaming turks for behaviour of a family . 
  what do you mean ? 
  the sultan 's family ? 
  yes , many had greek , bulgarian , romanian etc. 
  origins . 
  they were kidnapped as babies and raised as turks . 
  that 's even worse . 
  besides , that was only part of the army and the governors . 
   do you think that ottomans were really represents turks ? 
  yes . 
   they were even against nationalism and even turkish nationalism thoughts what is turkish nationalism ? 
   that 's why greek rebellion and serbian rebellion started too late . 
  there were attempts before 1821 , too . 
   all jewelers were jewish people or armenians . 
  traders as well with greeks . 
  there was only 1 turk in ankara who was trading and he was a partner of jewish . 
  jews did that almost everywere . 
  about armenians and greeks , maybe it 's because they always lived there . 
  and then they were genocided or deported . 
  it was n't the ottomans who did that . 
  it was the new and improved turkish government . 
   you guys hate turks for what ? 
  for being a farmer ? 
  we do n't hate anyone . 
  but be honest . 
  it was n't a group of farmers that occupied the balkans for all that time . 
  there were massacres before the revolution , too . 
  there were also raids and lootings . 
  that was , among other things , a way to kidnap boys and turn them into janissaries , after all . 
   you have killed 15.000 civilian in the war that you have mentioned . 
  i am not counting 8000 turkish soldiers . 
  after being oppressed for centuries , the greeks revolted . 
  as soon as they did , the ottoman government started commiting [ massacres ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/constantinople_massacre_of_1821 ) against greeks , in order to suppress the revolution . 
  since the revolution ( and by extention , our freedom ) was in danger , the greeks were forced to take actions they otherwise would n't take . 
  this might sound childish , but you started it . 
  and you left us with no other option . 
  and while this is not a competition , it 's worth noting that you killed many more people . 
  and i did n't even include the people you killed during the genocides you are famous for . 
   but there was a lot of brutal wars and conquests during those times from everybody unfortunately . 
  the mongols conquered korea , but i do n't think many people dislike mongols because of it . 
  it 's true that muslims were not the only ones who conquered lands and acted violently . 
  many peoples did . 
  the muslims , however , were instructed to do so by the quran , their holy book . 
  there are countless verses in it that tell muslims to conquer and fight for allah , against the disbelievers . 
  the persians , the mongols , the spanish and most other peoples who were conquerors in the past , did n't do it because of their faith , but for imperialistic reasons that do not exist anymore . 
  the muslims , on the other hand , still read and believe in the quran , the book that tells them to conquer . 
   they recently release a movie in korea about workers who were forced to work for japan , and their escape . 
  it 's called the battleship island . 
  i have n't seen it yet , but my friends say it was good . 
  looks interesting . 
  i 'll see it someday . 
   oh , that is the city with the air balloons , right ? 
  yes . 
   well , you see ... 
  i did n't want to be one sided but he is ... let 's see . 
   they have killed all turks and albanians in mora peninsula , crete , rhodos . 
  he does n't mention about that of course . 
  :d are you talking about the recapture of tripolitsa , that served as the ottoman stronghold in the peloponnese ? 
  did n't it have thousands of ottoman soldiers in it ?

  greece has a gdp/capita of 23,000 $ . 
  serbia gdp/capita is 3-4 ,000 $ the economic performance perfectly matched the standard of living . 
  greeks have the lowest or in the top 3 lowest household/private debts on earth . 
  the issue is government debt also known as public debt which stands at 170 % gdp . 
  this is due to many things , but i think that blank check military spending played the biggest role in this debt , not standard of living . 
  because athens airport is simply one of the best airports on earth for one reason , it has won dozens of prizes in websites/magazines as # 1 airport in its category . 
  besides that china has large plans to transform piraeus harbor in athens into its shipping hub , it would make sense to transform the nearby airport into its plane hub in combination which would give a centralized location for chinese corporations in europe . 
  lastly , nothing will be `` fire-sold '' or `` cheap '' . 
  the first thing syriza did in office was to stop the piraeus-china deal as they found the deal unacceptable and `` cheap '' . 
  tsipras will be visiting beijing in may to meet the prime minister where i assume the deals will be reviewed . 
  most likely the airport will not be sold away , but i can see the chinese being allowed to build their own section of the airport to manage their airplanes and logistics . 
  it was german owned when the evasion happened , [ spain got majority share in 2010 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hochtief ) .

  ** as a result , byzantine medicine had an influence on islamic medicine as well as the medicine of the renaissance . 
  china wants to make athens airport its plane hub into europe , just like they want to make [ piraeus harbor ] ( http://i.imgur.com/n21dhdo.jpg ) in athens their shipping hub . 
  from these two locations they can manage their european operations for shipping and transport . 
  it is pretty ambitious , tsipras will be visiting beijing in may and i assume these topics will be the main discussion . 
  also jordan , they are much better allies than saudi 's . 
  he who laughs last , laughs the longest, 
  most of that money was used to pay for the civil war which caused even more destruction than ww2 . 
  they just shifted their eyes away from islands/historic sites which were impossible and onto the greek energy infra-structure and other ultilities which they want to buy up for pennies . 
  [ 14 airports for less than 1 billion $ ] ( http://news.yahoo.com/greece-review-airport-privatisation-deal-minister-134011301.html ) to a german state owned corporation is only the tip of the iceberg of what they are attempting to do . 
  they are obsessed with greece selling off the entire country for pennies in all these `` deals '' so called `` bailouts '' . 
  the worst of all is trying to force greece to sell off its entire energy infrastructure and companies literally 1-2 years before greece will transform its economy into a energy based economy , with 5 pipelines in the works and dozens of gas wells/lng/hubs / etcx10 in the works . 
  i do n't care if greece crashes as long as we did n't sell out like new democracy was planning to do . 
  you can re-build as long as you own your own country , which germany for some reason is strongly against . 
  march 11 , 2015 - [ greece 's new government is `` radically opposed '' to the privatization of certain businesses , particularly in the energy and infrastructure sectors ] ( http://www.ekathimerini.com/4dcgi/_w_articles_wsite2_1_11/03/2015_548096 )  lafazanis added that `` honestly , i have n't understood why for some schools of thought , privatizations have become synonymous with reforms . '', 
    he argued that what he called the `` neoliberal deregulation in the energy market , which occurred particularly during the recent ( bailout ) years with the insistence of the ( european ) commission and the troika '' had prolonged and exacerbated greece 's financial crisis and energy poverty in the country . 
  if you respected law you would have dealt with this issue in 1990 , you people like to boast about `` morals '' when it comes to these bailouts . 
  do not be angry when this matter goes to court , after all you are a `` state of law '' correct ? 
  this is not about reparations to victims , it is about forced loans and damage to infra-structure . 
  the same is absolutely not true for greece and this matter will be left for a court to decide , not on random forums . 
  [ what went wrong ? 
  ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/26/opinion/paul-krugman-ending-greeces-nightmare.html?_r=0 ) i fairly often encounter assertions to the effect that greece did n't carry through on its promises , that it failed to deliver the promised spending cuts . 
  nothing could be further from the truth . 
  in reality , greece imposed savage cuts in public services , wages of government workers and social benefits . 
  thanks to repeated further waves of austerity , public spending was cut much more than the original program envisaged , and it 's currently about 20 percent lower than it was in 2010 .

  nyet , there is no procedure for leaving the eurozone or leaving the eu . 
  none . 
  the only legal way to leave the eu is put into detail here :  article 50 ( 1 ) teu provides simply that any member state can withdraw from the eu in accordance with its own constitutional rules . 
  the key part of article 50 is the next paragraph , which states that :   a member state which decides to withdraw shall notify the european council of its intention . 
  in the light of the guidelines provided by the european council , the union shall negotiate and conclude an agreement with that state , setting out the arrangements for its withdrawal , taking account of the framework for its future relationship with the union . 
  that agreement shall be negotiated in accordance with article 218 ( 3 ) of the treaty on the functioning of the european union . 
  it shall be concluded on behalf of the union by the council , acting by a qualified majority , after obtaining the consent of the european parliament . 
  greece will not choose to withdraw from the eu [ article 50 confirms the possibility of member states to leave the eu , and it is clearly the only legal route to leave , as a matter of eu law .

  i know very well the syriza policies on the matter but , to my recollection , there has never been an explicit announcement on the matter . 
  [ unlike this for instance ... ] ( http://www.latimes.com/world/europe/la-fg-germany-migrant-help-20150907-story.html ) edit : further , [ according to the unhcr ] ( http://www.unhcr.org/56d58c146.html ) , '' ... data as of this morning ( 2016-03-01 ) shows that 131,724 people made the journey during january and february ( 122,637 of these landing in greece ) . 
  this is approaching the total for the first half of 2015 ( 147,209 ) ... '' so we can clearly see ** when ** the flow surged . 
   erdogan was there the last year , and the year before the last year . 
   syrian civil war is there since 2011 . 
  and the refugee/migrant flow from turkey to greece has been there since the fall of the soviet union . 
  it was just smaller because there was n't a failed state so close to turkey before . 
  the refugees from syria have been accumulating in turkey for the last 4 years with little hope of going back to their country ( that is now a heap of rubble ) . 
   the only thing that changed in 2015 is the government in greece . 
  their choice was to stay in tents in turkey for the next decade or cross to europe , since very little was done to help them there . 
  how long can people live like that ? 
   and in 2015 the refugees flow in greece increased 20 times . 
  the people simply got sick of being stacked on top of eachother and left to find a better place . 
   syriza is the only one to blame for the refugee crisis , since they openly declared that `` anyone who wants to pass through greece to go to europe should be able to do so '' . 
  so first they called the refugees to come , then they say `` but they are coming , what can we do '' ... 
  i really doubt the refugees have ever even heard of syriza . 
  i bet they 've heard of merkel though ... 
   turkey has 3 million of them in their lands ( officially , probably the real numbers are much higher ) . 
  good luck controlling all of them . 
  even germany lost track of 100.000 of them and have no idea where they are . 
  fucking germany the richest country of europe cant control all of them but people expect turkey to perfect control of situation ? 
  how many of the people in turkey , of those who facilitate the sea crossing to the greek islands , have been prosecuted ? 
  or at least arrested ? 
  where do they obtain the ** thousands ** of rubber boats they use to cram the refugees/migrants that attempt to cross ? 
  how many turkish border guards/police have been deployed to the beaches right across from greek islands to attempt stopping those trying to cross ? 
  i am not saying that turkey has not spent large sums of money to help the refugees survive , it clearly has . 
  and turkey should be supported economically even more to continue to do so . 
  but the turkish government is clearly using those people as diplomatic ammunition by not even attempting to stop the flow into greece .

  i feel sorry for the innocent refugees and immigrants that are going to be dragged through the mud by the professional xenophobes and racists , who no doubt are secretly happy with these events . 
  that 's so inaccurate it 's not even funny . 
   `` look how powerful tzarist russia is !! '', 
  - `` ooops , it just collapsed under the bolshevik civil war ... '' except it actually was n't powerful , it had survived a revolution in 1905 and in 1917 it was engaged in the europe-wide massacre known as ww1 . 
  ww1 also brought germany , italy and hungary on the brink of socialist revolution and caused huge political crises in * all * the participating countries . 
  ww1 destroyed not just the czarist empire but also the german empire , the austro-hungarian empire and the ottoman empire . 
   `` but hey , now look how powerful stalin is ! '', 
  - `` ooops half his cuntry just burned and almost collapsed under the german invasion . 
  good thing the americans sent all that land lease '' stalin orchestrated a criminal and murderous persecution on the people of the ussr and on his own party and made catastrophic mistakes at the start of the war . 
  but the ussr did n't turn the tides of the war because of the lend-lease , not even a ` murican would claim that . 
  i do n't see how you can fit ww2 into your nice narrative of `` every 40-50 years russia collapses '' when in the end they were the winners of the war , the ussr was at the height of its power , it expanded its influence into most of the 3rd world and controlled all of eastern europe . 
   `` but hey , now look how powerful the nuclear ussr is ! '', 
  - `` ooops it just crumbled under its own economic and social inneficiency into a 90s third world country '' because it adopted a criminal shock therapy treatment which saw its vast wealth and resources plundered by russian mafioso-oligarchs and their western friends . 
  which is exactly why autocratic putin is so popular while gorbachev and yeltsin are seen as naive fools . 
  i hope you are joking , the us produced arguably the best literature of the 20th century . 
   ~ ~ / r/europe ~ ~ reddit , the only place where people will defend a holocaust denier . 
   we 've run out of actual inequality lol, 
  thanks for the clarification . 
  and it certainly was n't my intention to belittle the deaths of the people in the night club or the anger of the romanian people . 
  i am just tired of the double standards some commenters apply in these cases . 
  netanyahu has some bad news for you . 
  i do n't agree with the german law for inciting violence and i do n't agree with the british law which sent people to jail just because they cheered on rioting in august 2011 . 
  but yeah , i imagine they 'd find a lot of hate speech on reddit if they looked . 
  and who is to judge whether a protest is `` pure comedy '' or a justified reaction to a corrupt government ? 
  the user i replied to definitely implied that . 
  btw , nice to be in the spotlight again , take that immigrants !, 
  sorry we do n't hate black people , we are n't that advanced . 
  i agree , we should get more serious and start overthrowing governments for night club accidents . 
   in this country a graduate starts off in the public sector with a salary of $ 775 a month that 's if they can get a job in the public sector , which is a rare feat . 
  so yeah , 775 euros is n't something you should take as a comparison point . 
  huh ? 
  the greek people voted 62 % no to the eu agreement , 1 week after the banks had closed and capital controls were in effect . 
  you may accuse them of several things but cowardice should n't be one of them . 
  why are these guys so afraid of a russian takeover ? 
  they 'd fit right in . 
  do you or the british public seriously believe he 's going to give the falklands to argentina and northern ireland to the republic ? 
  this reminds me of greek right-wingers fearmongering that syriza would abolish religion or redditors seriously believing tsipras is a russian spy . 
  when in reality the syriza government has been disgustingly pro-religion and pro-nato . 
  greece ` stole property ' from the monarchy ? 
  we are scraping the bottom of the barrel here , lmao . 
  your mother 's village is supposedly doing something with eu money so elgin is retroactively justified to have stolen the marbles 200 years ago . 
  solid logic there . 
  yes i know that , i was asking whether blair actually delivered on his promises to tax the city . 
  his country is 144 years old . 
  yes , i am aware . 
  the word f\u00fchrer is n't either , but noone would use it to describe their leader . 
  an afd politician talking about the `` 1000 year germany '' means he is either stupid or it 's a dog whistle for pegida and npd sympathisers . 
  you 'd expect the head of a german political party often associated with far right views to avoid using phrases like that . 
  something something 1000 year reich . 
   the city of london would pick up the bill did that really happen ? 
  seeing these 19th century ethnographic maps . . damn the germans were fucking obsessed with ethnicities . 
  arguing for belize being somehow more valuable allies than argentina and india . 
  i do n't even ... 
  damn , that 's some excellent design work . 
   the system grew naturally capitalism 's early forms grew naturally from the feudal system but tons of blood were spilled for the system to take root and completely destroy the old status quo . 
  1789 was primarily a bourgeois revolution and so were many of the national independence revolutions and movements . 
  capitalism is a modern phenomenon and there were other economic systems before it . 
  why do you think only this system is compatible with human nature ? 
  and how can you be sure it 's the final form of social organisation for humanity ? 
  i do n't think he was blaming the communists , more like he was blaming the economic elites for adopting fascism to protect their interests against communism , as it happened in italy and germany . 
  i mean it 's just one aspect of the rise of fascism , but still . 
  yeah well . .  the enmity between the russian orthodox church and the soviet state came to an official end in september 1943 with the election of patriarchal locum tenens metropolitan sergii stragorodskii , de facto leader of the church for seventeen years , as patriarch . 
  the election had been preceded by a momentous september 4 meeting in the kremlin between joseph stalin and three leading metropolitans : sergei , aleksei simanskii of leningrad and nikolai iarushevich of kiev . 
  stalin granted them the right to open a limited number of churches and religious schools , and to convene a national synod on september 8 , which duly elected sergei patriarch . 
  upon his elevation , sergei immediately declared stalin the divinely anointed ruler . 
  [ source ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askhistorians/comments/27e8op/why_was_homosexuality_illegal_in_the_secular/ci0cvw3 ), 
  someone linked a thread from / r/askhistorians ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askhistorians/comments/27e8op/why_was_homosexuality_illegal_in_the_secular/ ) where they discussed lgbt rights in the soviet union . 
  the tl ; dr was that in the first period until the early 30s the bolsheviks decriminalised homosexuality , there was skepticism towards it but also some progressive communists ( alexandra kollontai for example ) that were way ahead of western perceptions at that time on matters of gender and sexuality . 
  then stalin came and repealed many laws of the first period in order to restore the nuclear model of family . 
  many reasons are given : he was ideologically conservative himself , he wanted people to reproduce , a populist move to appear closer to the cultural level of the average backwards religious peasant , an attempt to make an alliance with the church , etc. 
  it 's clearly a relic of the soviet past ^ ^ / s, 
  / r/europe 's schizophrenia in a nutshell . 
  russia says something stupid about gays :  gayropa helped the ukrainian nazi jews , soldiers got lost on vacation wink-wink , how stupid are the russians amirite ? 
  ukraine says something stupid about gays :  stupid western european sjws , why does everything have to be about gays and women ? 
  i am not 100 % sure about other countries , it is definitely the stereotype here . 
  but we get hundreds of thousands of german tourists every year and way less czechs so you might be right too . 
  are you kidding ? 
  the major eu powers ( france , germany , uk ) are never going to agree to something like that . 
  unless they want all of * their * former colonies and places they occupied to sue for reparations against them . 
  it was an anti-colonial revolution , primarily . 
  and it did n't need to be bloody because there was no ancien regime ( other than the british government obviously ) to be purged . 
  well , it did lead to * all * the modern western democracies . 
  but they are now too shy to admit it . 
  * checks for russian and greek responses * ... yep , nothing :p the serbs have been memed so hard that they do n't give a fuck . 
  the austrians try not to mention some certain stereotypes . .

  well most people seem to be convinced that god either exists or does n't , even though neither can prove their position . 
  `` agnostic '' literaly translates to `` one without knowledge '' so yeah , i suppose we 're the yellow people . 
  worst 563 years of my life . 
  depends on the context but yes , we usually refer to latin letters by their english names . 
  and syriza is currently rulling with a 36 % , that 's how multi-party democracies work sometimes . 
  not comparing the two obviously , just saying . 
  no , is tuesday day in rossija . 
  that 's a bit romanticised , it 's more of a generic exclamation . 
  for example if i see somebody about to trip on the pavement i might spontaneously shout '' \u039f\u03a0\u0391 ! '', 
  as in `` watch it ! '', 
  i think `` kratos '' is used in the ancient sense in this context . 
  as in `` great is the strenght of the sea '' .

  if you ca n't into nordic you can definitely into epilepsy . 
  i did n't say they were , but religion is not the issue here at all . 
  no , not really . 
  my point was that different countries have different reasons to be critical of us leadership . 
  the second most important issue in greece right now ( the most important being the economy of course ) is the situation in syria and the refugee crisis and let 's face it , we 've all , including the us , been handling it really bad . 
  nato opened a bag of shit by inventing some shamefully bad excuses to intervene in the area and pulled out before it was stabilised . 
  saddam 's imaginary wmds was a valid reason to call the entire alliance to arms but aparently isis 's very real raping of the entire region is n't . 
  and orthodoxy is n't some magic glue that binds people and it 's not above politics . 
  ukraine and georgia are orthodox and it did n't prevent any wars with russia . 
  i guess latvia and estonia must be itching to rejoin the ussr by that logic . 
  apparently poland does n't :p, 
  they are not opposed to the existence of a caliphate , as long as they control it .

  due to the fact that we do n't control the full 12 nautical miles around some of our border islands ( [ it 's an ongoing dispute ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/aegean_dispute ) ) the closest landmass in 99.9 % of cases is in fact greece . 
  we are talking about distances short enough to swim across if you 're desperate , not the pacific ocean . 
  plus there 's the issue of having to deal with sultan gollum across the aegean , not the most reasonable person . 
  the navy is out there but as soon as they get approached by the navy or coast guard they puncture their boats . 
  also bear in mind that there are no international waters between turkey and greece in the places where they choose to make landfall , so they 're either in turkish waters where our navy can not enter or in our waters where the navy has to abide by international laws and pick them up because they 're technically shipwrecked . 
  the issue at hand is legal/ethical , no matter how many ships you throw at them they are still able to cross . 
  they are in a better place with god , free of latvian oppression .

  they 'll probably see you as a bit of a sociopath . 
  yeah , if i go around saying that i would be sociopath . 
  in fact , if i go around saying the exact opposite ( * i want good things to happen to people !, 
  * ) i will also be seen as a sociopath , because its fucking weird to say these things to random people . 
  but again , claiming you represent the views of most people is kind of useless . 
  you are not speaking on anyone 's behalf . 
  this is n't high school . 
  if you got an argument about why having a negative thought makes you a bad person , go right ahead . 
  this is what i meant with thoughtcrime , by the way . 
  that someone is somehow `` bad '' because he or she has the wrong thoughts , regardless of his or her actual actions - a concept you seem to enjoy a lot . 
   either you like it or not , brexit will test a lot of things , including the economic impact of leaving the eu . 
  except the uk did not enact brexit to test any hypothesis , which was the point . 
  never heard any official or non-official claim that . 
  if you have , go right ahead and share it . 
   for example , i 'm sure the eu could easily go back to its pre-1992 status without causing any general hostility between countries or raise in xenophobia . 
  in fact , i 'm far more worried about the consequences if that does n't happen and the eu keeps being pushed to further political integration . 
  unfortunately it ca n't , because the political forces pushing for less eu are either dishonest , incompetent or crazy . 
  basically crazy nationalists . 
  if these was a modest opposition to integration , we would be having a different discussion . 
  but there are n't many , because most reasonable and educated people support the eu . 
  even if you are a reasonable and educated eurospectic , you are stuck in the team of angry reactionary ideologues . 
  also , you need to be extremely polite in your next message if you want my attention . 
  you already sound like a bitter troll , so unless you impress me with your manners you know what 's going to happen next , 
   how many people changed their mind as a result of an online argument . . good question . 
  i guess it is impossible to know , right ? 
  but i respect your attitude even if not your views , i see what you mean ( i think ) . 
   i should have the right to refuse any work i do n't like . 
  why not ? 
  because it leads to minorities and vulnerable members of society being segregated further . 
  think of it like not driving over the speed limit . 
  yes , the government restricts your freedom to go as fast as you can , but it is done for the good of society . 
   sorry i do n't see why a gay couple should adopt and destroy a children . 
  kids need a good strong example of both father and mother . 
  this is n't true , but i suspect you wo n't change your mind no matter what . 
   because it 's this year http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/come-on-it-s-2015-current-year, 
   genes do matter . 
  about half to 3/4 of iq is heritable . 
  http://www.wikiwand.com/en/heritability_of_iq that is controversial at best, 
  yeah we also know about this empire thing . 
  unlike you , we had more than one . 
  but look at where we are now . 
  here is the thing with the past : it 's over . 
  you need to accept that , or invent a time machine idk, 
   gays will be able to get state benefits originally intended for the preservation of the next generation you get these benefits regardless if you have kids . 
  having kids is not an legal obligation you have before or after getting married . 
  also gays can adopt children also if you do n't want to provide equal service to gay people , go live in russia or saudi arabia , but in the civilized world you will do just that, 
   remember reading about a brutal rape of a 10-year old boy in austria where the rapist ( a refugee ) got 6 years , then appealed to the higher court . 
  this higher court threw out the case because it accepted his excuse , which was that he had n't had sex in 4 months and was in `` sexual emergency '' . 
  that is not what happened and you should educate yourself before parroting whatever shit the alt-right posts on the internet the case was not thrown out . 
  he is still guilty but only on one charge and he will remain in custody until he is tried again . 
  this is his lawyer trying to buy him time on a technicality : `` an appeal court accepted the defence lawyer 's claim that the lower court had not done enough to ascertain whether or not the rapist had registered that the boy said no . '', 
  there is no chance he will be set free because sex with minors is illegal regardless of intent . 
  i ca n't believe people here think he just walked free because of political correctness . 
  this disconnect from reality is kind of orwellian , to be honest . 
  wow , your edgy and contrarian , non politically correct , comments are really hurting liberalism . 
  i can barely handle the edge, 
  i am sorry for what that catholic priest did to you , when you were young have some love < 3, 
  still ca n't tell, 
  man , you have the density of a dying star and greek too ? 
  you should know better when it comes to these matters, 
  i like how you get mad when people do n't accept your random numbers, 
  so basically no matter what , the eu will always be evil, 
  that would all make sense if we were doing science in a lab , and the resulting observations did n't cost anything to anyone . 
  and even if we were talking about science , it would n't be weird . 
  like i am sure the researches * wanted * the higgs boson to be found . 
  but more importantly , when did we establish thoughtcrime ? 
  did n't know it made me a bad person to want something bad . 
  because i think it 's largely irrelevant : whatever i feel about the uk is completely pointless in the face of numbers . 
  the numbers decide who is right , not my subjective emotions . 
  but i 'll even grant that : let 's assume there is thoughtcrime . 
  it is pretty weird that the people who * want * the eu to collapse and thus affect the lives of millions of people are rarely seen as evil . 
  they are generally seen as proud concerned citizens who simply love their country . 
  how dare we question that , right ? 
  so it seems like a very one-sided case of thoughtcrime . 
   rather than using how the uk does to test their hypothesis i do n't think you seriously believe that . 
  brexit is not a test of any hypothesis , nobody has ever claimed that , even the most fanatical brexiters . 
  the movement is pretty much ideological , which is the exact opposite of having hypotheses and then testing them . 
   if it turns out that the eu is unnecessary you should n't be unhappy because it will have been a misguided project in the first place . 
  just for emphasis : take a look at my first sentence again . 
  this is n't science . 
  the collapse of the eu , if it comes about by brexit and not some other rational process , will lead to increased conservativism , xenophobia and general hostility between the former nations . 
  and before you are triggered by me using the mean term `` xenophobia '' , let me elaborate . 
  if the eu goes down , it wo n't be trippy liberals who will hold the reigns . 
  it will be the reactionary populists who want to turn back the clock to * older * times and have been extremely clear and honest in their intentions . 
  not sure if trolling or serious, 
   we 'll get there eventually with any luck . 
  well , the old people have to die if we are to get there . 
  i do n't mean murder , i mean natural causes which leads to them being replaced with progressive younger voters and for that thankfully no luck is required , just mother nature doing her part, 
  yeah i do n't think your reluctance is the problem . 
  i think i speak for most people when i say that it 's perfectly reasonable to be reluctant in this experiment the problem lies in lying . 
  take in as much refugees you want , do n't take in anyone , but do n't be dishonest in your narrative of the uk 's relationship with the eu . 
  this is what irks people . 
  you got a good deal and you are still claiming that the brussels wants to rape your country . 
  but such is politics . 
  it 's the most outrageous morons that get their voices heard - and they are the tail that wags the dog . 
  this is why i think it 's not possible for brexit to be for the betterment of both parties . 
  politicians and the media will exploit it to no end to inject even more hysteria , esp . 
  if your economy takes a hit, 
   great question . 
  the answer is obvious there is this thing called a rhetorical question , look it up  all it takes is someone to call it out , and the house of cards tumbles .

  the mods have no say if 18 month old videos by blatantly racist youtube accounts are to stay or not ?

  edit : just noticed this video is 18 months old wtf . 
  yeah , in greece we had the phenomenon of second generation albanian , romanian , etc immigrants joining golden dawn to fight the new immigrants from pakistan and bangladesh . 
  it is n't a humanitarian crisis on the scale of donbass , syria or eritrea but it is a humanitarian crisis nonetheless . 
  i have seen / r/worldnews threads glorifying the apartheid regime , we are not far from that . 
  should n't these issues have been addressed before the country could join the eu ? 
  another example of the eu going for the quick buck and not thinking about the future , much like the eurozone . 
  lisbon treaty referendum in ireland , was it ? 
  the amount of hate-speech spewed by some eastern europeans in r/europe is amazing . 
  especially from countries that have practically no immigration problem and that are immigrant nations themselves .

  i am talking about romanians , who have been the victim of negative stereotyping in britain , france , italy and even greece . 
  it 's not just the gypsies , do n't fool yourselves . 
  poland has the smallest percentage of foreign-born citizens in europe while polish is the second most spoken language in uk/ireland after the english .

  edit : i mean it * could * have a swastika , but then it would be taken down by youtube . 
   so if the byproduct of this is that some spies had their cover blown then i have to say i do n't exactly feel sympathetic exactly . 
  these people are n't civilians , they 've volunteered to be agents . 
  their cover getting blown is a risk they 've subscribed to . 
  is turkish intelligence totally controlled by erdogan ? 
  does the army have any influence on it ? 
  it 's a philosophical question .

  probably different ethics too . 
   and other states like greece wanting certain parts of the middle east we try one tiny bit of western-style imperialism and suddenly we are britain and france !, 
  at least the guy who beat us was a secular reformist !,

  we tried into international power relevancy !,

  trying to somehow spin this into anti-islamic rhetoric . 
  amazing , * bravo * . 
  if the us attempt denazification in * every single * middle eastern country and * every single * time this fails , maybe , i do n't know , the us should stop doing it because ** it does n't work ** ? 
  or even , dare i say , because it was a stupid plan all along ? 
  it 's not a conspiracy when two elected heads of government are vetoing a plan in a eurozone meeting and it 's not a conspiracy theory when another elected official accuses them of having a plan to do so because it 's in their political interest . 
  it 's called politics and diplomacy . 
   `` we found opposing us an axis of powers ... led by the governments of spain and portugal which for obvious political reasons attempted to lead the entire negotiations to the brink , '' said tsipras , who won an election on jan. 25 . 
   `` their plan was and is to wear down , topple or bring our government to unconditional surrender before our work begins to bear fruit and before the greek example affects other countries , '' he said , adding : `` and mainly before the elections in spain . '', 
  i do n't see the word conspiracy here . 
  pasok stands for socialist and both major portuguese parties have social-democracy in their name . 
  neither syriza 's ideology nor their policies are radical left . 
  varoufakis , who is portrayed as * extreme * by european media , is a keynesian economist . 
   fun fact : germany would n't give two shits about greece if greece was n't trying to freeload on other eurozone members .

   fabricating absurd conspiracy theories regarding fellow member-states . 
  are you referring to tsipras ' claim that the spanish and portuguese governments have been trying to hinder the greek government since the beginning ? 
  first of all , that 's not a `` conspiracy theory '' , it 's a political opinion , and it 's not even a `` conspiracy '' , it 's rajoy and coelho working for their own * obvious * political interest . 
  i ca n't blame them , everyone in their position would do the same . 
  did n't work out that well for rajoy , eh ? 
  some eu countries love merkel , others not so much : greece , cyprus , italy , spain , portugal , ireland . 
  if syriza is radical left then i 'm che guevara . 
  1970s western european social democracy was way more radical than syriza . 
  golden dawn was surprisingly mainstream during that time ( that is , before the murder of pavlos fyssas and prosecution of gd ) : they polled above 10 % , some newspapers were semi-praising them , lifestyle shows on tv were having interviews with them , etc , so it 's not hard to see how an uneducated * kagkouras * ( our national type of jerk ) thought it was cool to give the sieg heil . 
  he claimed afterwards he did n't know this was the nazi salute and that he had only seen it by gd , though i do n't know if i believe him . 
  i mean , how the fuck can you not know about [ this ] ( https://volkundvaterland.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/adolf-hitler.jpg ) ? 
  hahaha, 
  obviously you are an idiot if you think anti-german sentiment had anything to do with syriza getting elected . 
  it 's only fair you can join your ancient turanic bros hungary , finland and estonia . 
  how is serbia in this map ? 
  the british are , on average , more sympathetic to greece than most continentals and a grexit will only make the whole eu project more unstable in the immediate future so i do n't see how that 's the case . 
  so schaeuble as a gauleiter and german government with swastikas is fair play by you ? 
  because i remember a lot of angry responses by people `` who were charlie '' over those cartoons . 
  they even demanded a newspaper apologise . 
  free capital movement is n't left-wing by any definition . 
  are they comprised of swedish nationals are are they predominantly russian/albanian/italian / insert_other_country_with_international_mafia ? 
  the greek idiot did the sieg heil and has been banned from national teams for life , croatian player simunic chanted some ww2 fascist song along with ultras and was banned from 2014 wc . 
  also includes the clergy , unfortunately . 
  quite interesting how hungary is so far removed from the other finno-ugric speaking areas . 
  kind of ironic seeing how the failure of yanukovich to deal with one such civil ( ish ) uprising is what allowed the current government to become government in the first place . 
  wow , the hate is real . 
  yes and trotskyists hate stalin more than anything in the world . 
  but the r/europe mob does n't care about such details , everyone who is n't a social-democrat or a christian-democrat is considered * insane * by them . 
  how is he `` insane '' ? 
  you 're basically insulting milne the same way / u/phsoftie insulted you . 
  people should stop using psychiatric terms when talking politics . 
  hehehe . 
  he also mentioned the `` culture '' thing . 
  well , he did say * complete * control . 
  also , greece and cyprus happen to be members of both the eu and nato . 
  good luck to the eu negotiating with turkey and israel without us backing , lol . 
  also , in the case of a greek exit from the eu , good luck to croatia : i really hope their border control is strong . 
   its real easy for somebody to pull up something about another country to show that this was n't just particular to greece however . 
  then why do you do it ? 
  i can find more links about strikes in germany for the last 5 years alone . 
  i generally agree with his articles but i ca n't comprehend how he still supports labour . 
  i bet it was a redditor . 
  the wiesenthal center has condemned the baltic states numerous times over what they see as antisemitism and nazi nostalgia . 
  mind you , i do n't agree with their definition of antisemitism and i think the intentions of the baltics are more anticommunist/anti-rusian than they are antisemitic , i am just mentioning it because you brought them up . 
  i agree obama is a warmonger but i am sure g.w. 
  bush would have no problem whatsoever killing lots of people with drones if their use was so widespread 10 years ago . 
  haha , this is such rubbish i am not even mad .

  and the people living there sure as hell wo n't wan na go through what the greeks are going through now . 
  so unless the spanish and italian governments ** fuck up as hard as ** the samaras and papandreou governments had , podemos and grilo ( ? ), 
  will never gather enough power to form a government . 
  it is a cheap excuse to say that torturing greece would persuade spain and italy to keep quiet . 
  not to mention morally abhorrent . 
  it 's the debt restructure . 
  nothing else . 
  a lot of people have called the latest proposal `` capitulation '' . 
  they could n't be more wrong . 
  the reforms proposed by syriza are * even harsher * than the 2 week old institutions proposal but they include a debt restructure clause . 
  so ** nobody ** can blame syriza anymore for not making enough concessions and if the syriza proposals * do * get rejected , it will become clear that the sole reason for that was the debt restructuring itself and nothing else . 
  so syriza can go to default ( and drachma ) and simply blame eu unwillingness for debt restructuring . 
  and no logical counter-argument could refute that .

  the first bail-out was worth 110 billion euros . 
  there should have never been any kind of bail-out . 
  it never was the responsibility of the eu countries ' taxpayers to finance the bad investments of any bank or hedge fund . 
  and those 110 billion matured and `` maturing '' bonds were not at greek hands ( because most of those were long term bonds ) but at the hands of speculators who only bought 3 , 6 and 12 month bonds again immediately after they expired . 
  so one speculator who bought 4 consecutive times a 3 month bond at 3 % interest within a year ** made a 12 % + ( because of the added effect of compound interest ) interest in a single year ** . 
  and this had been going on for ** years ** with the same banks and funds before the bubble burst .

  in greece we have a points system . 
  run a light , or park illegally and you get points charged on you license . 
  if you gather a certain amount of points you get your license revoked . 
  sometimes temporarily , sometimes permanently . 
  but it gets five or six violations to get to that point . 
  i do n't know anyone who has , because police does n't bother . 
  if you do you must be the unluckiest driver in greece . 
  oh shit , i must catch up with times !, 
  firs do n't affect the sovereignty of the nations . 
  aircraft , including military ones , are allowed to cross them but they are still obligated to submit flight plans . 
  in 1952 we signed an agreement that gave the space over our border up until your airspace to our fir , but in 1974 you decided that you do n't agree with it . 
  that said , we do n't have the right to intercept you guys if you have submitted flight plans . 
  but not doing so is interpreted as a malign provocation . 
  but anyway , i do n't believe a dispute over a 4 mile strip of air should be the reason for two sovereign nations to be in a constant state of bad diplomatic relations . 
  according to icao we have the right to monitor the international air space ( 10 nm ) in order to safely and smoothly conduct civil aviation . 
  this was recognized by turkey from 1931 to 1975 . 
  and here 's where my knowledge on the matter stops . 
  i also know we have the right to extend our borders to 12 nm ( law of the see 1982 ) but we have n't in order to not increase the tensions . 
  `` look who 's back '' is a best seller ? 
  i want to read that book . 
  i hear it 's going to be a movie . 
  i know , right ? 
  and i have to put up with these every day !, 
  i actually support that , but officials luck the necessary will . 
  btw , fines are extremely expensive . 
  they 've made them so expensive in order to scare people away from traffic violations , but the bad driving behavior is so much engraved into our culture that it 's not going to change anytime soon . 
  taxi drivers do the most violations but when someone gets a ticket , their union erupts throwing accusation that the state does n't allow them to do their job and there is always a public official with a sympathetic ear that 'll make the fine disappear . 
  i was referring to turkish violations of greek airspace by turkish f-16s . 
  the post being about a violation of a nation 's airspace by another , and not about how bad the soviets behaved to polish , i thought my comment would n't be open to various interpretations . 
  unless over there you never hear about those things that happen over the aegean . 
  to be fair , though , i 'd expect from our side some violations of turkish airspace as `` retaliation '' but we definitely do n't hear about those . 
  something , something dark side !, 
  how could she have known that ? 
  did she do another study and found out that the results of the other study were wrong ? 
  you see , it 's common practice over here as well . 
  what can one do ? 
  give a ticket to every driver and motorcyclist in athens ? 
  we should , but it 's not feasible . 
  most of them ca n't afford to even pay it . 
  besides , there are no sufficient infrastructures and drivers will have to park on the sidewalks , because there are no alternatives . 
  pedestrians ca n't afford to speak up because they drive too , and they do the same thing . 
  you see , athens was n't build for cars , and not just the city center , but the whole city , including many of the suburbs . 
  poland , greece understands you . 
  which university ? 
  in ours we have a whole department filled with communists and anarchists . 
  i 'd expect such a response from them . 
  but even so , i do n't remember anyone that had gone to celebrate in public ( streets , tv , etc ) . 
  we will build a huuuuuuuuuge wall and make ~ ~ mexico ~ ~ white cisgender male heterosexuals pay for it . 
  yes , actually there is a wage `` gap '' only if you average the total amount of earnings for women and compare it to the corresponding average for men . 
  however , these researches do n't take into account factors such as maternity leave , or the fact some women choose to commit to their families and work less/not at all , or a lot of women choose to become nurses and social workers instead of engineers and software developers . 
  if you 're doing the same job , work the same hours , but earn less than a male employ in your place of work , then please hold your boss accountable !, 
  also black lives matter supremacists in the us fight for segregation in order to keep their selves safe against `` the evil whities and their cultural appropriation of the black culture ! '', 
  you ca n't teach an assaulter not to assault . 
  these things should be taught in early childhood . 
  what we should do is educate people about the dangers and how to protect themselves . 
  assaults will always be present , however rare , so one would be prepared to protect oneself should the need arise . 
  being a private company they should do whatever they want , provided that they do n't harm others and do n't monopolize the market . 
  if people do n't like it , they can spend their money on another company . 
  that said , i 'm completely against segregation , whatever its purpose , and very very skeptical on what constitutes `` harassment . '', 
  did women on german trains were really harassed or did someone gave them a nasty look , or an inappropriate comment and they all cried wolf ? 
  seeing that the regressive left is on the rise ( please correct me if i 'm wrong ) in germany , i ca n't trust public opinion on matters such as harassment . 
  i 'm also pleasantly surprised by the rational quotes inside the article . 
  common sense is still a think , yeay !, 
  : of course i do n't condone harassment of any form or occasion . 
  just saying . 
  well , more like `` imperialist pigs , they should n't have bombed the middle east . '', 
  mostly uttered by leftists and communists . 
  also , anti-american sentiment was , and still is , pretty big . 
  this is not to say that people who share that sentiment felt good about the attacks , but it 's what i said a few comments above `` horrible , but they had it coming . '', 
  additionally we have a lot of conspiracy theorists ( bush did 9/11 , jet fuel ca n't melt steel beams ) , really a lot , that believe american jews are behind everything . 
  no one `` celebrated . '', 
  some were characterized by apathy . 
  the gcp ( greek communist party ) was saying ( and still is now ) that what happened was awful and reprehensible , but they should n't have been imperialistic pigs . 
  can we establish a european `` troll erdogan day ? '',

  our bad reputation comes from the fact that we have a lot of lazy public sector workers that work 3-4 hours a day and are n't at all efficient . 
  why do we have so many lazy public sector workers ? 
  because fro 40 years political parties ( both socialists and conservatives ) would promise their voters easy , secure jobs with a steady pay . 
  my experience comes from the private sector , though , and i can tell that if you were to calculate the mean working hours of private sector workers they would surpass 40 hours/week .

  i just really hate the idea that smaller populations are somehow `` bad for the economy '' . 
  you stumbled on my pet peeve ) . 
  a declining population obviously will eventually slow down the gdp , but that is irrelevant to the economic health of a country . 
  there is no reason to believe it would lead to a lower gdp per capita or a lesser purchasing power of individuals . 
  the only thing we should start thinking about is privatizing pensions with only basic pensions for poorer people .

  if an ancient macedonian saw this , they would think these are smoothed painted tree trunks . 
  ca n't they just go with something neutral like `` yugoslavic '' and be done with it ? 
  the language is so pluricentric that the various bosno-serbo-croatian dialects already pass through borders making a messy dialectal continuum . 
  it is pretty much impossible to know where `` serbian '' ends and `` croatian '' begins and vice versa . 
  just one of the 3 major dialects has so many subdialects that you end up with [ this ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c3/shtokavian_subdialects1988_incl_slovenia.png/1280px-shtokavian_subdialects1988_incl_slovenia.png ) . 
  they 've been so fixed on keeping the argentinians away from the pacific that their animosity is spewing all over . 
  we 're rich in spirit !, 
  what are you talking about ? 
  their states are [ very different ] ( http://hitormiss.yolasite.com/resources/coloradovswyoming8.jpg ) from each other . 
  you keep your anschluss in your pants , jerry !, 
  yeah , like tzatziki/cac \u0131k , which we spend time fighting over , while it 's most likely we both took it from the armenians . 
  first , we need competent leadership to do any of those . 
  and greek governments since the metapolitefsi seem positively set on ruining this nation . 
  greece is greece 's worst enemy . 
  has been thus for a very long time . 
   well you kinda fucked up coming in with fake economic stats . 
  that 's a commonly repeated delusion and quite annoying , to be frank . 
  according to the greek financial audit of 2004 :  ... it was clearly stated that `` the impact of new accounting rules on the fiscal figures for the years 1997 to 1999 ranged from 0.7 to 1 percentage point of gdp ; this retroactive change of methodology was responsible for the revised deficit exceeding 3 % in 1999 , the year of emu membership qualification '' . 
  the above has led the greek minister of finance to clarify that the 1999 budget deficit was below the prescribed 3 % limit when calculated with the esa79 methodology in force at the time of greece 's application , and thus , since the remaining criteria had also been met , was properly accepted into the eurozone . 
  esa79 was also the methodology employed to calculate the deficits of all other eurozone members at the time of their applications . 
  that 's true . 
  i do n't think any muslim french citizen would ever pick up a stone and throw it on a non-covered woman . 
  that 's what the muslims in europe need to know : they can follow their religion in europe , but without the old-fashioned misanthropic ideas coming with it . 
  christianity was like that once , but it evolved and changed * a lot * since the middle ages . 
  if islam wants to thrive in europe , it needs to change as well . 
  it 's more like 100 years of pain or ??? 
  years of suffering . 
  and with every single greek government being an eu puppet so far , we need a miracle to be saved . 
  just look at the current clowns in power . 
  they gained their place by promoting a clear anti-austerity and eurosceptic viewpoint . 
  quickly afterwards , however , they agreed to the worst austerity measures , completely let the economy cripple , and became even bigger eu bitches than the previous govts . 
  we are really fucked . 
  there 's no party promoting anything close to economic assurance as of 2016 . 
  staying in the eu is fine , it 's the ez that was a mistake . 
  we should have never entered in the first place . 
  now , all we can do is dance to the beat they play for us . 
  leaving the ez would have been disastrous back in 2008 , let alone now . 
  tbf , putting some meat through a skewer and bbq/grilling it does n't really need a culinary genius to be developed . 
  gyro/kebap/shashlik variants have existed all over asia , europe , and even africa for god-knows-how-long . 
  there 's no way only one of them gave birth to the others . 
  a hijab is also a cultural wear , not a religious one , so it does n't fall under the `` freedom of religion '' law as many like to erroneously point out . 
  islam calls for both men and women to wear decent and modest clothing . 
  there 's nothing in the quran about covering your head/hair . 
  the way muslim societies interpret the `` modesty '' part is up to personal choice . 
  bj then . 
  or bojo . 
  either way , you can be quite creative with it . 
  looking at [ how empty canada is ] ( http://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2006/as-sa/97-550/vignettes/img/map-2006-pop-density-canada-sz01-en.gif ) , anywhere on the black parts shall do . 
  why would they ? 
  give me a noteworthy example of a gender-specific social behaviour ( even one that is generalised ) that is n't because of social influence . 
  sure , certain aspects would be pushed into the gender because of biological reasons . 
  for example , women will still give birth , and their motherly instincts would largely help make them good parents . 
  but on a social level , a man and a woman are n't that different to begin with ( at least in more equal societies and cultures ) , so what would make them behave according to their gender if not their cultural upbringing ? 
  does the fact you have a penis or a vagina between your legs dictate your place in society and general behaviour ? 
  if you 're a man/woman in a small rural northern nigerian area , sure . 
  but , if you 're a man/woman in dowtown oslo or bergen , not so much , right ? 
  we 're halfway there already . 
  you obviously have no interest in understanding what the difference between sex and gender is , so i 'll stop trying to enlighten you . 
  not * become * man/woman , but * self-identify * as one or the other . 
  if we could have an anthropological experiment with a bunch of children born and raised in a closed environment and living without knowledge of what `` being a boy '' or `` being a girl '' is , then they most likely ( we ca n't be sure cause it has n't happened because of obvious ethical reasons ) would n't self-identify as one of the two . 
  they would notice their bodily differences , but would n't put them in genderly terms and `` behave like their gender '' . 
  picking a gender , living with it , following its norms , and entering the society with it is largely a social convention . 
  if we were n't raised as males/females from birth , we would n't be ascribing such categories to ourselves . 
  looks like germany is still segregated . 
  that 's what happens when you 're stuck on the wrong side of the iron curtain \u2122 . 
  you 'll get dragged easterly with the rest of the ex-socialists for eternity . 
  tough luck !, 
  well , the sex does n't change . 
  the gender does . 
  sex is biological . 
  you 're born with it and ca n't change it . 
  gender is a social construct . 
  it 's what you identify as and it does n't necessarily agree with your sex . 
  wrong branch of the family tree . 
  you 're probably thinking of spain 's habsburgs .

  if things keep going this way throughout the 21st century , young immigrants from [ sub-saharan africa ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2e/countriesbyfertilityrate.svg/863px-countriesbyfertilityrate.svg.png ) seem to be the key .

  big guy turkey sat back and enjoyed the carnage for 5 years , while small guy ypg had thousands of brave men and women killed in action fighting back isil . 
  and the ypg is not the one `` stopping the turkish army '' . 
  turkey is the one who invaded and seizing the land the ypg held free . 
  turkey attacking the ypg and preventing their fighters from focusing on isil is what helps the is . 
  for now , turkey has only moved against kurdish rebels and the ypg . 
  whether they will actually prove useful against isil remains to be seen . 
  so , turkey is attacking the very group of fighters that has been the most effective in pushing back isil and you call that honesty ? 
  is the fact that turkey uses isil as leverage to invade a foreign country and attack its kurdish opposition something anyone would be proud of ? 
  `` oh yes , i 'm helping the region 's globally recognised terrorist group by moving against this opposing terrorist group ( recognised as such only by me ) that 's been fighting them for 5 years ... but i 'm honest about it , so it 's all cool ! '',

  * europe ( an union ), 
  even if we wanted to , it 's not like they would let us do it . 
  if we had a currency of our own it 'd be easier , but with a currency shared with 18 other countries things get way more complicated . 
  the eurozone prefers to drag a sick horse behind it in hopes of exploitation and ( eventual ) recovery , rather than let it loose to do its own thing . 
  no , it does n't . 
  no muslim majority country has ever had a female imam . 
  the problem is that the majority of muslim countries will take denmark 's stance as an insult to islam . 
  allowing women to lead prayers as imams is unheard of in muslim countries and there might even be laws or religious rules against it . 
   she said that she is demonstrating how free women are in islam in the context of what culture , though ?

  liberal populism is okay , it 's the leftist populism which gives / r/europe a collective aneurysm . 
  oh okay , so we should have voted for the journalist-turned-political-opportunist whose politics are a carbon copy of the aforementioned , if they are defined at all ? 
  or greece 's very own version of ukip ? 
  or the kke or golden dawn ? 
  who * should * we have elected in your opinion ? 
  yeah we should have voted for samaras or venizelos , right ?

  wow , you managed to make the overwhelming majority of economists , citing basic macroeconomics 101 theory ( is-lm ) , sound absolutely nuts . 
  the liberal extremism of this subreddit is just absurd sometimes . 
  no wonder / r/europe managed to drive every russian poster from the subreddit . 
  they hated him because he was a leftist who would n't fold to the whims of capital and liberalism , and he needed to be punished lest the left gain momentum in europe . 
  oh you mean the report the european commission tried to block the imf from releasing because it called austerity a second-best solution and believed the current requested debt relief was needed as early as 2011 , destroying any credibility the troika had in continuing with their austerity policies ? 
  the liberal position might lose , that 's what is wrong with it . 
  democracy is wonderful and grand , only if you vote for liberals and social democrats from now until the end of time . 
  her economic policies are :p, 
  and austerity started in 2008 , so i do n't see what 's so invalid about the source . 
  it 's not like their position has changed since then .

  do you even is-lm , bro ? 
  there is absolutely a consensus against austerity in the economic discipline , only austrian nutcases advocate it . 
  even the imf has called it an abject failure . 
  its the extremist liberal politicians who choose to ignore them . 
   the word does not mean anything formally oh okay . 
  `` stop the german hate , you lazy parasitic hostage-taking greeks ! '', 
  -- german media for the last 7 years, 
  seriously , you guys have told us how to run our country for seven years , handpicked a prime minister for us , and after that told us how to vote in four consecutive elections . 
  the fucking arrogance . 
  anti-austerity positions are absolutely the consensus among economists , whereas the opposite is true for politicians . 
  even the fucking imf admitted austerity has been an abject failure in europe . 
  the uk had quote expansionary monetary policy to complement their austerity , the eurozone has had contractionary policy . 
  it 's not the same at all . 
  you can compare the situation in europe to a hypothetical situation in which the liberal and conservative parties of canada cooperate to keep the ndp from ever winning an election . 
  except now the ndp is getting popular , so the other parties supporters are getting pissed off . 
  i do n't think this is attributable to any material change to the sub . 
  i must think its the same extremist centrism that has always been on display , except now there are very real threats to their monopoly on policymaking at the european level , and the centrists are throwing a fit . 
  its as if they believe the only people who should ever govern anything are liberals and social democrats . 
  oh okay , i forgot we lived in a europe where treaties and laws are not enforced anymore . 
  thanks for reminding me . 
  it will just `` happen . '', 
   `` referendums should decide fundamental constitutional issues , not immediate economic tactics , however momentous '' nevermind that the constitution itself says that a referendum can be called at any time on an issue during a national crisis . 
  is this some new kind of football where the goalposts move wherever the players want them to ? 
  i personally think they 're great, 
  and at one point the prime minister of greece was not elected either . 
   kicked out of europe . 
  it 's been 7 years and still no one has found out what mechanism there is for getting kicked out of europe . 
  those are the only choices . 
  there is no alternative . 
  austerity or out of the euro . 
  nice try , samaras . 
  no sane economist advocates austerity in a recession . 
  there were several profitable state run firms sold off too , like the most profitable lottery in all of europe . 
   without common policy pretty sure germany wants all the debtor countries to privatise , cut and export . 
  perhaps germany should leave the euro if it is so unhappy behaving like they 're in an economic union, 
  he was very competent . 
  he broke away from his own party after throwing a fit to start his own , then went * back * to his old party and rose all the way to the top . 
  a very competent power-grabber . 
  good riddance . 
  he is the epitome of greek corruption and power-hunger . 
  no u, 
  i do n't think you read my comment , your response has nothing to do with it at all . 
   if you ca n't handle your budget the imf and ecb have effectively been handling greece 's budget for the last 7 years and have brought on even economic outcomes than the original recession . 
  liberals across europe love democracy , until their monopoly on it is called iinto question . 
  new democracy was being accused of fixing opinion polls , after internal party documents were leaked saying they would try to do just that ( not sure if the leak was verified ) . 
  registered = eligible votes counted reporting = % of eligible votes counted voted = turnout, 
  umad , yes supporters ? 
  thing is many were arguing that opinion polls were leaning in favor of yes , because of internal new democracy party documents leaked which basically said they were trying to fix the polls . 
  from your own damn article  as the imf recommended , imports were reduced and exports were increased . 
  the effect of the cuts in imports in romania , a net importer of food from the west , was however not correctly estimated by the foreign analysts and it led to food shortages . 
  and its easy to get out of a crisis when you have a world superpower on your doorstep to export everything you own to . 
  greece does not have that and will never have that . 
  so what , there is only one policy for all economic climates ? 
  economy doing great ? 
  time to cut spending !, 
  economy doing bad ? 
  time to cut spending !, 
  the overwhelming majority of economists think austerity is the absolute worst thing to do in a recession , it has a history of failing nearly everywhere it has been tried , and that stimulus spending and expansionary monetary policy is proven to be effective . 
  the ones that do n't are loony pseudoscientific austrians that no one in the discipline pays attention to . 
  yet the political mainstream in europe sided with them for the last 7 years . 
  then his comment is irrelevant to the discussion . 
  the change they want to see has only made the problem worse for 7 years . 
  austerity is the reason this problem has not been solved yet . 
   austerity or leave the eurozone these are the only choices , there is no alternative / s, 
  if you believe that either of this things were implemented in greece as a response to the recession , at any point at all , then you 're deluded beyond belief and there is no reason continuing discussion with you . 
   without raising taxes or cutting services , which was always going to be impossible expansionary monetary policy and stimulus spending is actually the most successful policy mix that countries ' have at their disposal . 
  there 's nothing responsible about austerity in a recession . 
  it has such a horrible track record , that economists promoting it might as well be accused of pseudoscience . 
  liberals and social democrats need to cement their monopoly on policymaking until the end of time , or they will never be happy . 
  i think its that plus `` i ca n't let leftists have any sort of momentum in europe . '', 
  he chose the culture which northern europeans believe is inferior to theirs . 
  dank memes must be cut by 35 % , circlejerks by 10 % and a new brigade tax must be imposed . 
   european leaders can not bend to the will of an extremist party . 
  they are being extremist liberals . 
  sorry , you do n't get to have monopoly on policymaking forever . 
  there is no such thing as a free market . 
  it 's an unreachable fantasyland . 
  and calling a culture `` lazy '' is not science in any way whatsoever . 
   making the necessary reforms first the list of `` necessary reforms '' never ends , and neither do the horrifying results of them .

  good thing the proud patriotic brits voted for brexit . 
  kick these muslims back to where they came from . 
  then surely you must like it ? 
  here is what you said  i welcome rusia propaganda ; at least it is not a 24 hours a day bashing of white europeans like the western media do all day . 
  another `` white '' victim , being genocided by soros and his crew of liberal elites, 
  i 've been hearing that it 's `` quickly changing '' as long as i can remember . 
  yet these kinds of conservative views are making a comeback try to consider that maybe this is confirmation bias on your part . 
  at least for greece , the scenario that was described is very typical behavior . 
  not uncommon at all . 
   it 's as if the media are trying to say that the citizens themselves would n't vote for right-wing parties in france or germany if it were n't for russians and it 's not because the citizens are fed up with the situation regarding the migrant crisis . 
  germany has a right wing party in charge . 
  i do n't think most people think it through to such an extent . 
  i mean let 's be real , we are all overanalyzing such things here in / r/europe . 
  i imagine most people simply do n't care and go with their gut feeling . 
  it is not that they are authoritarians who hate the rule of law , not at all , it 's just that there are more important things to consider like football . 
   i doubt that change was ever this fast , in terms of technology , economics and most importantly connectivity . 
  its true that our changes are n't something entirely new but for the first time we are all so connected . 
  connectivity allows for communication and from there consolidation of desire into action to slow down the change and to go back . 
  plus there is also the demographic factor . 
  never have the old been such a large portion of population . 
  i sort of agree . 
  i mean , the rate of change seems to be faster than what it was . 
  but it 's all relative . 
  when people were drinking water out of their fucking hands and suddenly somebody invented a cup , i imagine they freaked out just as much . 
  * what is happening to our traditions ? 
  will we forget how to use our hands ? 
  are we turning into a bunch of pussies with all these tools ? 
  * etc. 
  we live too little and are too emotional to properly assess changes . 
  it 's probably an evolutionary thing , this resistance to change . 
  but , unfortunately , improving our material conditions and thus our well-being entails a lot of change . 
   plus there is also the demographic factor . 
  never have the old been such a large portion of population . 
  true but there were way more wars and diseases that affected demographics in more visible ways . 
  having a lot of old people is not something you easily notice , especially if you do n't have a good frame of reference ( and who does ? ) . 
  if there is something unique about this era ( if i can call it that ) it is how good we have it . 
   its true that these new politicians are anti-establishment but what is establishment today . 
  free trade , democracy , minority rights , outsourcing , change and unpredictability . 
  what do you think is the instability in today 's world ? 
  like what kind of instability are these people responding to ? 
  well this is n't the / r/unitedkingdom . 
  go back home , we 've had enough of your kind illegally coming over here . 
   i simply do not understand how people are so afraid of refugees to the point of believing their own culture and identity to die out . 
  do they have so little faith in their cultural heritage that they believe refugees could destroy this heritage ? 
  insecure people . 
  they do n't really care nor particularly identify with their culture . 
  if they did , they would understand that refugees can not destroy what thousands of years ( and two world wars ) did not dent . 
  nationalism is , essentially , a victim culture . 
  this is weird . 
  i imagined that if you ask any conservative guy , he will have the same expectations : the woman should be at home raising the kids etc , while the man is with other men having man time and doing man things i did n't know this was an exclusively muslim thing . 
  i thought this was the case in pretty much everywhere on the planet . 
  it seems i have been lied to, 
   this is definitly happening , go to berlin-moabit and look at how men are behaving there . 
  lol women have been harassed since forever , if they but dare to expose some skin it 's funny how the only way to be taken seriously as a woman is to be harassed by a fucking muslim . 
  if someone else does it , you are a hysterical feminist slut who ca n't take a compliment damn , now that i think about it , it really sucks being a woman, 
  wow your account made it past its first day ? 
  congratulations man, 
   a lot of people do n't know their place in the world that emerged in the last 20 years . 
  for them things are changing too fast . 
  i do n't know how true this is as an explanation , but as a fact it has been going on since the dawn of time . 
  i would be surprised if there was a generation where things * did n't * change too fast . 
   more than anything people want stability . 
  the appeal of the nazis , of fascists was n't in killing the jews or fighting the bolsheviks but in bringing stability . 
  people want stability and they are willing to give a lot of leeway to the person who gives them the feeling of stability . 
  this does n't seem to be true , because as far as i can tell , none of them want stability . 
  their main points are shaking things up '' and `` challenging the establishment '' . 
  they want as much instability as possible , because it directly feeds into their scaremongering rhetoric . 
  dude the defense `` i just lured them in '' does n't work , you should know that . 
  i am not saying they are guilty , just that if someone wanted to defend their actions that would be the worst way to go about it . 
  it is not that simple . 
  you have to wear a uniform to identify yourself as a combatant before engaging in military action . 
  so they were probably breaching some law or something . 
  i dunno , maybe they were dressed like prostitutes so that counts as a uniform ? 
  i wish , but sadly we are too soft . 
  ( only half / s ), 
  ussr ! = warsaw pact i understand why you think the eu is the lovechild of nato and nafta , even though i disagree ( because i think the eu is novel and very unique to european politics ) but the ussr has nothing to do with anything . 
   but jews in europe were much better behaved than muslims . 
  in hindsight , maybe . 
  at the time , people believed in the `` protocols of the elders of zion '' , which basically accuses jews of crimes far worse than what the muslim terrorists have done in our time . 
  edit : i should say that people still believe in the validity of the protocols , so it 's not like that shit is over . 
   `` christian , national europeans of our kind have not been dealt the cards '' victim mentality at its finest . 
  the soviet union ? 
  that was dumb of me, 
   or if sturgeon makes a stupid power play that leaves everyone far worse off than they otherwise would be . 
  sounds familiar , just like brexit . 
   that 's kind of how democracy works mate . 
  but , strangely enough , this does n't apply to the eu . 
  edit : removed mean-spirited comments, 
  well if you * feel * confident that 's great , because that 's all that matters my friend, 
  good explanation , thanks . 
  i disagree with only one thing , that they are not stupid . 
  they actually are stupid . 
  politics is not entertainment like football . 
  everyone should take a few hours ( that 's how long it takes ) to learn the basics of what is going on . 
  just an internet connection and a few hours out of their shitty lives , nothing more . 
  i know this sounds bad but since political correctness is dead , i feel i am entitled to express myself this way . 
  yeah ok . sanders did not face the ruthlessness of the republicans head on , just like clinton . 
  we do n't know what they would have done to him . 
  who knows what shit they would have found ? 
  how would he have handled it ?

  that 's the thing i see . 
  they were the ones that actually brought turkish food in greece ( like mousaka ) and not the turkish conquerors.funny is n't it ? 
  i do n't see turkey similar to us but anyway , i agree that iranian influence is more correct, 
   the dominant language has remained greek , but this does n't change the fact that cyprus has seen a completely divergent history from greece since the initial colonisation . 
  exactly . 
  that 's why i never considered cypriots to be `` greek '' . 
  they have a completely different history than greece , and only the language remained and that 's thanks to the byzantines . 
   your average cypriot looks noticeably different from a greek for this very reason . 
  agreed with that too . 
  cypriots look more like syrians or lebanese than greeks and that 's due to the island 's geographic position and history . 
  we accepted many christian turks in greece during the population exchange when kemal wanted to get rid of them . 
  i do n't know if you 're trolling or not , but better check up your history . 
  btw i 'm not christian, 
  i know that cyprus is not in europe . 
  the island was considered to be a part of levant and not europe . 
  but somehow cyprus entered the eu so people consider it a part of europe . 
  the case with turkey is different.plus cypriots speak a european language so it 's easier to view them as european i guess, 
  oh really ? 
  are there many christian families in turkey ? 
  anyway my comments point was that turkey is more in asia than in europe . 
  you turks have a vibrant culture with anatolian and arabic influences and you have no reason to try to look more european . 
  of course istanbul turks have a european vibe but generally i know of turkey because of it 's kinda exotic culture and i see no reason that turks would want to fit in europe . 
   people of greek origin not all cypriots are of greek origin though . 
  it 's not in europe . . why not just keep posts from istanbul here ? 
  what a stupid comment . 
  romanians are just as european as a pole , plus you 're not in a place to judge who is a real european or not, 
  romania is in europe . 
  turkeu has a small part in europe . 
  simple as that . 
  it 's not ironic . 
  mersin is in asia . 
  i do n't know how italians view us , but greeks love italians . 
  i guess the reason is because we share a lot of history together and that `` mediterranean culture '' thing, 
   they do n't have to change the name of their nation just to avoid triggering nationalist greeks . 
  i completely agree with that . 
  listen , i 'm not trying to say that our countries are neutral with no history together or whatever . 
  i have not studied the serbian war of independence and i did not knew it was helped by greeks . 
  in greek history ( even in school ) i studied that we were helped mainly by philhellenes from many parts of europe . 
  so i 'm not saying that serbs did n't helped , but that 's something i did n't knew . 
  in order to gain independence , ottoman subjects fought together , from example this is what ismail qemali ( albanian national leader ) tried to do : * the athens embassy of the ottoman empire reported that qemali negotiated with organization financed by wealthy tosks and greece about forging a union * so you see that the leader of albania 's independence movement tried to unite some of his people with greeks , although that did n't happen . 
   so please , do not fucking claim you know history , cause as you can see , in both our uprising and your serbs and greeks worked fucking together . 
  so again , you 're clearly very poorly educated in history . 
  yes because every single greek knows that we helped serbs at their independence war and vice versa / s what i 'm trying to say is simply that , without knowing about serbia , greece during it 's history has fought together with many people from different backgrounds , so i 'm not neutralizing the efforts of serbs . 
  yes we fought together at balkans wars , you are saying we have some military history which i agree you also should know though , that during greek war of independence greeks fought side to side with christian albanians and also many people from italy and central and northern europe , known as [ philhellenes ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/philhellenism ) . 
  afaik serbs and greeks did n't cooperate during 1821 greek revolution nor during serbian revolution . 
  greeks also fought side to side with americans , brits , aussies and new zealanders in ww2 . 
  that does n't mean our countries are `` brothers ''  so you 're either not a greek , or you know your history , very very poorly , greece and serbia have always been close , not just ` nationalist fanatics of red star and olympiacos i was brought up by greek parents in greece and as you can see i know greek history pretty well . 
  what i 'm trying to tell you is that greeks have fought side to side with many different nationalities , including serbs and albanians . 
  about nato bombings : they saw no reason to bomb serbia because serbia never hurt us , so greek government decided to stay neutral and they did . 
  of course greek people were not ok with bombing civilians but that 's not something kept inclusively for serbia , there were many anti-war demonstrations during the iraq war too when peaceful protests happened in greece against the atrocities in the middle east . 
  but truth is , greeks knew little about what was going on in yugoslavia/serbia and montenegro at the time and the atrocities of all sides of war . 
  i 'm sure greeks opposed bombings against serbia but they would also oppose massacres and ethnic cleansing done by serbs in kosovo if they knew the whole situation that was going on at the time in short , yes our countries have good relations but that 's not so much because ww1 . 
  maybe it 's the greek government refusing to participate in bombings , but it 's mostly because politicians and political goals . 
  so yeah , that `` orthodoxy '' thing is bullshit , at least from my perspective . 
  edit : minor corrections, 
  i 'm not going to say anything about that `` orthodox brotherhood '' thing because it was created by fanatic fans of crvena zvezda and olympiacos , i just ca n't understand it . 
  besides that , yes i think that greeks are more friendly towards serbs than other balkan nations like croats or bulgarians . 
  what was your impression of greeks ? 
  i have a serbian friend ( from srpska ) but we do n't discuss politics . 
  have n't seen him since like summer but anyway . 
  personally , i do n't think our countries have something particular in common rather than . . orthodoxy ? 
  i am friendly with anyone here and my comments was n't meant to be against serbia but rather against this politicians statements which i find really not necessary . 
  the fact that i support kosovo does n't also have to mean that i contradict how you view greeks . 
  i mean , just because our government decided to not recognize kosovo does n't mean that all greeks support this decision . 
  in greece you 'll meet many people who support kosovo , but you 'll also meet many who do n't . 
  most are indifferent, 
  i am not an arvanite and i do n't think arvanites have something against serbia . 
  i guess your comment is just a troll attempt , because if you think that people of albanian descent like the arvanites you referred to dislike serbia or something , then you 're just stereotyping people easily . 
  disputes like kosovo are discussed mostly on the internet anyway . 
  i never heard/overheard greeks talk about serbia or kosovo, 
   serbian fm says recognition of ` republic of macedonia ' was ` foolish ' no one gives a fuck , it 's been years so why is he making that statement now ? 
  from his words it 's obvious what he 's trynna say . 
  i hope greek politicians stop listening to idiots like him and finally recognize kosovo because , mr dacic , no one cares about all those monasteries either . 
   but we went and gave our brothers the greeks that 's straight out of youtube comments . 
  what brothers is he talking about ? 
  this ai n't the stone age dude to clarify , i have no problem with serbs and serbia in general . 
  it 's simply the fact that this dude brought up that stupid name dispute so that the greek government does n't change it 's opinion about the kosovo dispute or something . 
  i personally do n't care how fyrom is called or if they have `` macedonia '' in their name , but i 'm pro-kosovo and i really want to see my country recognize it , so statements like this are not so likeable, 
  for some reason the first portuguese flag looks like a flag that was used by greeks for coat of arms, 
  what 's up with the dark blue in northern germany and the light blue in central poland ? 
  some guy said it 's a made up map from 4chan . 
  i agree, 
  that 's a lie that 's actually easy to believe because it 's fascinating . 
  they 're just an indo-european population that has being there for centuries, 
  seriously the serbian and russian are inaccurate as fuck . 
  `` we love these guys '' fits better to italy or france, 
  it 's kinda inaccurate . 
  only a full religious guy would refer to russia as `` orthodox bro '', 
   because it was a cheap geopolitical move by usa only to counter russia 's influence in the balkans and give them the ability to have a say in the region but albanians in kosovo wanted independence for years . 
  that 's more important . 
  i seriously have never discussed this with family or friends . 
   i certainly do why ? 
   feel free to make a question in r/greece about the subject if you want . 
  our subreddit is pretty well balanced in terms of ideologies and i 'm sure that you 'll get some very informed and rounded answers . 
  i have read opinions in r/greece about kosovo and indeed they seemed balanced, 
  oh , that stupid name dispute once again . 
  if both parties were n't so petty this would have been solved years ago, 
   because it will alienate a huge part of their voting blocs and no political leader want to see his party shrinking and lose parliament seats . 
  i do n't think the average greek would care if the greek government recognizes kosovo, 
  i ca n't understand the cypriot one,

  the students vote 83 % for no and 13 % for yes . 
  a facebook group for my school with over 1000 members held a poll and the results were very similar . 
  it 's clear that the young people are overwhelmingly for no . 
  also , in both public * and * private employees the no vote is ahead . 
  the only social groups where yes is ahead are pensioners , housewives and businessmen ( though it makes no distinction between employers and self-employed ) . 
  the girl with the blue hair though . . 
  \u0399 think this ship has sailed . 
  imf 's decision to release its debt analysis today , former ec president romano prodi 's and renzi 's quotes , also today , show that the eurozone kicking out greece is very unlikely . 
  also , the insane media propaganda in favour of ` yes ' in the greek media ( trust me , you ca n't comprehend how bad it is unless you 're greek ) and insulting statements such as the one by martin schulz today have done a lot of harm to the ` yes ' camp . 
  schulz is going to get a lot of bitch-slapping by juncker . . 
  hehehehehehehehehehe thanks obama !, 
  they wo n't allow you to hold a referendum though . 
  try it . 
  please , 
  nice straw man there , but i wo n't bite . 
  the nsa wikileaks , the imf leaks and many other documents , books , etc released since 2010 clearly show that merkel , schauble and co constantly contradict themselves , lie to the greeks and lie to the german voters about the viability of the greek bailouts . 
  if you ca n't accept it that 's your problem . 
  the opposite is also true . 
  most here are right-wing when it comes to economic matters . 
   if they sign everything we will be again here in a few months , maybe a year . 
  i am starting to believe those who say this is deliberate on merkel 's behalf . 
  they really do n't want a long term solution , they want the ez to be in crisis_guardian_live_feed_omg_it 's _ happening mode every few months . 
  the constant fear of a grexit keeps the euro low which helps german exports . 
  yeah ... not believing him . 
  i was n't blaming the americans , i was just anticipating the knee-jerk reaction . 
  it 's the economics version of `` if you like immigrants so much maybe you should take them in your house '' . 
  inb4 `` if the americans love greece so much maybe they should pay for their debt ! '', 
  which guys ? 
  the `` yes '' side in greece loooove rajoy 's ~ ~ anti-greek ~ ~ anti-syriza propaganda . 
  do n't people in spain understand that * if * podemos were to take power in spain , alone or in a coalition , they 'd be in a much better position to negotiate than greece ? 
  i mean you 're spain , you do n't need greece to find examples or counter-examples . 
   greece 's negotiators were encouraged or maybe mocked by the troika to hold a referendum in may if they thought they could not accept the deal . 
  they did not call one . 
  i am going to need a source on this one or else i call bs . 
  edit : no worries , just found it ( [ http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/05/11/eurozone-greece-schaeuble-idusb5n0vd02620150511] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/05/11/eurozone-greece-schaeuble-idusb5n0vd02620150511 ) ), 
  what about papandreou 's proposed referendum in 2011 ? 
  in an eerily similar way with what is happening today the reactions were : - you crazy bro ? 
  - this is a bad decision because reasons . 
  - i am going to tell you when to hold the referendum ( sarkozy ) - i am going to tell you what the question of the referendum is going to be ( merkel ) - please cancel it i also found this gem ( emphasis mine ) :  dutch prime minister mark rutte said the cancellation was a good decision amidst possible ** eurozone impatience with greece ** . 
  `` it was ** a bizarre proposal ** . 
  we think it 's of great importance to the eurozone that we prevent greece from going bankrupt . 
  but in the end , ** the euro is more important than greece 's membership of the eurozone ** . '', 
  but yeah , let 's just pretend it 's the arrogance of varoufakis and tsipras that 's to blame for europe 's stance . 
  ( this is n't a jab at you just because you 're german , i respect your opinion even though i do n't agree most of the time and i 'd like to hear what you think ), 
  and how do you think the debts of other countries are produced ? 
  by peace and prosperity ? 
  our debt basically dates back to the war of independence and all the major defaults happened after catastrophic wars . 
  the formatting of the letter was a big issue only on this sub because the guy who opened it did n't have adobe reader installed . .

   when it 's so that the us as an actually sovereign nation/financially sound one guaranteeing the efficacy of its security apparatus to guard the entire western world 's financial and social interests remains as such , yeah , sure . 
  you do realise this is totally subjective , right ? 
  can anyone find an actual resolution/announcement by the council of europe regard the greek referendum ? 
  a press release [ in their website ] ( http://www.coe.int/en/ ) ? 
  anything ? 
  have the country members voted ? 
  if not , mr. general secretary should take his personal opinion and stick it up his arse . 
  the pope already weighed in . 
  we are patiently waiting for greenpeace , the security council of the un and eurovision to offer us valuable advice on how we should vote . 
  i am sure you are equally critical of the us government when they say fuck off to the un and other international organisations . 
  `` lol , we 're not going to question the legitimacy of a referendum in great fuckin ' britain . 
  greece on the other hand ... '' - council of europe, 
  much like most countries . 
  if / r/europe wants to be governed by ultra-majority governments they are free to move to russia or turkey #hehehehehehe, 
  because we live in a capitalist system . 
  the rich have the power . 
  sure . 
  but still , it 's not like the simple people in greece have the power to enforce such measures by themselves . 
  why do n't the americans change the ridiculous tax evasion of the 1 % ? 
  why do n't the british tax the multinationals ( starbucks , etc ) that have been evading billions ? 
  [ here is a bloomberg article for you ] ( http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2012-06-12/syriza-seeking-greek-shipping-billions-seen-risking-60-000-jobs ) . 
  notice the blatantly pro-shipowner tone of the headline and the article . 
   `` you can not squeeze and tackle a person that is in international shipping trade and finance and say , ` i will tax you , ''' said restis , who controls a fleet of more than 200 vessels . 
  `` the answer is ` sure , tax me . 
  find me . ''' [ bloomberg , 2012 ] ( http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2012-06-12/syriza-seeking-greek-shipping-billions-seen-risking-60-000-jobs ) i ca n't find jean-claude * `` friend of the people '' * juncker or any other eu official in the article protesting against greek capitalism . . 
  but ok , let 's forget about the past 5 years . 
  i sincerely hope this particular bullet is included in the final agreement and the government tries to tax the shipowners . 
  i am sure the eu institutions will help us when they change their flag and settle in rotterdam and oslo #not, 
  when was it a commitment ? 
  when did the troika visit athens for their monthly reviews of the programme and said `` gee , i see you have n't taxed the shipowners . 
  i 'm going to cut the funding '' ? 
  never . 
  you 're so ignorant it 's not even funny . . 
   uhm . . it is an actual term for providing loans to greece and icluded in the ` yes ' . 
  umm ... 
  i 've been living in this country for 26 years and i 've closely followed what 's happening since 2010 . 
  it never happened in 5 years of memoranda and obedient greek governments , it 's not going to happen now . 
   ah , that 's the proofs !!!!!!!!!! 1111 !!, 
  there is no need for ` proof ' , the fact that latsis and the rest of greek big capitalists remain not only untouched but in fortune 500 lists and the such , while the country is in shit , is proof enough . 
  as i wrote in another thread :  many employers in greece are threatening lock-outs or have already started giving unpaid leaves . 
  others are heavily pressuring their employees vote ` yes ' and to attend the ` yes ' rally today . 
  in a big law firm - which coincidentally had business with greece 's privatisations - they even told their interns : `` you do n't need to actually work this week , just convince as many as you can to vote ` yes ' '' . 
  and it 's not from hearsay , but from sources very close to me . 
  why ? 
  if you have n't heard that many , many employers have been doing this since saturday you must live in another planet . 
   the shipping companies actually support putting a tax on them ? 
  to the point of forcing their employees to go and demonstrate for putting a tax on them ? 
  while the government has been opposing doing that ?

  we are going to take your tourism, 
  what do you think the s400 is meant for ?

  when turkey invades others it doesnt want to be hit . 
  spread your '' turkey is a democracy and peaceful '' fairytale somewhere else . 
  we know from cyprus what you want to do . 
  lol . 
  your comment exactly shows why we should be worried about turkish invasion . 
  those '' claims having legitimacy '' is exactly what we worry about . 
   these greeks ( those who think turkey will ever invade greece ) are truly fucked in the head . 
  how misguided and delusional can you be that you think turkey has its eye on greece regardless all of our internal and other external problems because turkey has been peaceful ? 
  your country already kills own minorities and jails journalists . 
  just look at what turkey has been doing in the last 3 years from supporting isis to invading syria to threatening armenia . 
  but according to you , turkey is all peaceful and all the neigbors are the threat . 
  oh because you need a s400 for fighting the pkk ? 
  who are you kidding . 
  this is pure for invasion tactics against balkan countries .

   it 's funny when someone pretends to know about things he has no clue about . 
  why are you even at this subreddit ? 
  according to you only turks are knowledgable about turkey and the rest of us is blind . 
  we apparently are seeing something else than the democratic turkey where the voters are voting out erdogan . 
  apparently violence against white people is not terrorism but justification !, 
  im talking about his support for violent terror movements sucha s the black lives matter movement . 
  the movement which vows to kill all white people , and who have raped and kidnapped a mentally-ill white man from chicago . 
  so you are saying that turks didnt go on the streets beheading their own soldiers , hopping on tanks and fighting with armed special forces ? 
  there is even videos of helicopters shooting at people . 
  they were willing to die for erdogan , dont mess with me . 
  there were people beheading their own soldiers . 
  soros * is * by all means a terrorist if you look at the definition of it . 
  he uses money to influence politics via violence ways . 
  im not supporting the hungarian government but soros is not innocent . 
  it would be funny if only people of a country were allowd to speak on it . 
  keep kidding yourself . 
  in germany there were only 80k . 
   we ask the same question to people who vote for erdo\u011fan and they usually respond with `` because there are no better alternatives '' . 
  half of people who vote for erdo\u011fan actually dislike many things about erdo\u011fan absolutely false . 
  millions of people went to the streets to fight the turkish army for the sake of erdogan . 
  millions of people remained silent when he killed tortured and jailed kurdish polticians . 
  erdogan is the democratic voice of turkish society . 
  to hell with those so-called '' international agreements '' . 
  literally no country on the face of earth except european and american countries and india respect those agreements . 
  100 % of the other ones ignore them or interpret them as they wish to . 
  what is wrong with all this muh international agreement guilt ? 
  it 's not like an imaginary god will come and sanction us . 
  he is right though . 
  italy ( and my country greece too ) all talk like they are in a strong position while weakening themselves by allowing groups such as frontex to illegaly take migrants into our countries . 
  let 's ask the yazidis and assyrians who have reported of more than 50 genocides against them by muslims over the past 100 years . 
  but i guess somehow usa was still responsible for that , didnt htey ? 
   would you guys than be so kind and stop bombing the middleeast so this people dont lose their homes and have to run for their lives ? 
  would be a great help when you guys would just go home because isis came out of american bombs ? 
  stop support islamic terrorism with your leftist ignorance . 
  islam has a great tendency to breed extremism . 
  wo n't happen . 
  it 's not impossible , but highly highly unlikely . 
  the akp controls all the powers : executive , judicial and lesiglative . 
  and it 's not just erdogan controlling it , it is his whole party . 
  he is now ` training ' younger akp people to take over his role once he is done . 
  in fact , he is training his son-in-law who is an islamist-nationalist leader . 
  his name is berat albayrak and he is already the energy minister . 
  quickly , give them jobs !, 
  and jail the ones who are fighting isis !, 
  this is against the eu human rights . 
  the german government doesnt decide what hate speech is , the ** court ** does that . 
  this is against the eu human rights . 
  the german government doesnt decide what hate speech is , the ** court ** does that . 
  i do n't think that is a justification in any sense . 
  by point out she is a conservative , we make it seem it is normal to be conservative and anti-gay . 
  but that is not the case , and there are many conservatives who are pro-gay . 
  this is a very disappointing behavior coming from merkel . 
  especially after all her social justice rants against eastern europe when they refused to take in migrants . 
  disgusting how you try to justify it . 
  if it were ee country doing it you would call them nazis and '' authoritarian '' . 
  germany is being run by a conservative homophobe . 
  they do that to annoy turkey or force turkey to do something and then abondon kurds and armenians . 
  it 's a dirty tactic used by the colonialists against minorities . 
  i 'm glad that greece escaped turkish colonialism otherwise we would also be a tool in the hand of germans who would claim to help us one day and then abondon us the next day . 
  they are the majority . 
  akp + mhp has around 70 % of votes . 
  dont come here telling about what they did to kurds . 
  germans , french and especially spanish people are not interested in that . 
  they just want to hear that ataturk was secular just like the military and that minorities in turkey are actually well treated because at their holidays at the beach they dont see soldiers committing warcrimes, 
   which causes any german-pushed policy to be resisted internationally . 
  again not true . 
  germany is the instigator of many '' reforms '' in the eu . 
  just because their ideas have some ridiculous content sometimes ( merkel inviting all the muslims of africa and me into europe ) doesnt mean it has anything to do with '' prejudice against germany because of wwii '', 
   anyway , are you prepared for tolls ? 
  forgive me for my ignorance , but did n't open borders mean that we are n't fed with this kind of things ?

  beautiful as hell !, 
  question for the spanish people out here .

  greece lost 7 % - 11 % of its population during ww2 . 
  but even if what you say were true , the civil war was a direct result of ww2 and us/british actions after the german and italian occupation . 
  and i think that you do not understand the moral bigotry here . 
  we never shoved people in ovens by the masses to get rid of them , but germany deserved debt forgiveness while greece does n't . 
  ultimately , the question is if it is justified that people suffer just because of money . 
  i think it 's not . 
   yeah , germany started ** one world war ** , it was responsible for over 50 million deaths and sunk europe in a deep crisis for years . 
  a crisis that would 've doomed the whole continent if the usa did n't want to create strong allies against the warsaw pact . 
   sure , they really did deserve the debt relief . 
  but fuck the greeks . 
  they borrowed more money than they could handle . 
  let them rot .

  the second part comes from the greek word '' \u03b5\u03c0\u03b1\u03bd\u03ac\u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u03c3\u03b7 '' = revolution .

  greece should never have joined the euro -- it used false statistics . 
  ] ( http://www.ekathimerini.com/4dcgi/_w_articles_wsite3_1_08/12/2011_417884$ )  people often make the mistake of lumping these two issues together when there is clear distinction between the two . 
  ** there is a valid economic argument that greece , and several other countries , should not have joined the euro when they did . 
  in greece 's cases , it had achieved only a superficial convergence based on public debt and deficit figures but the negative underlying economic factors should have meant that the greek organ was rejected in this currency transplant . 
  ** the structural problems that greece never addressed , such as its decrepit public administration and weak production base , meant that it was at a disadvantage from the start and would have had to undergo a remarkable transformation -- one which was never attempted by the country 's timid politicians -- to achieve a sound footing within the eurozone . 
   instead , greece ended up producing only one euro of its own wealth for every three that it imported over the last decade . 
  however , this issue is totally removed from that of forged statistics . 
  it has become a throwaway line for commentators and journalists to write that greece fibbed its way into the euro . 
  this misconception is largely driven by the decision of the new democracy government that came to power in march 2004 to conduct an audit of public finances that led to greece 's budget deficit figure being revised upward , above the 3 percent of gross domestic product limit for euro-area members . 
  ** however , the deficit increase was largely down to the conservative administration changing the way military expenditure was recorded . 
  ** rather than record the spending when the procurements were delivered , it attributed them to the date when the orders were made . 
  this exposed a weakness in the way that the eurozone treated statistics . 
  ** by failing to agree on a uniform system for all , it allowed statistics to be open to political manipulation in several member states , not just greece . 
  ** it is an issue that the european commission has only addressed over the last few months . 
  as dimitris kontogiannis revealed in kathimerini english edition recently , the eu now uses the delivery method to record procurements , which means greece 's deficit when it joined the european monetary union in 1999 met the 3 percent target . 
   ** according to the commission 's database , several other countries ' deficits , including france and spain , were over 3 percent . 
  ** some will argue that this is irrelevant now and in a sense it is . 
  but the regular rehashing of this myth has contributed to the impression among commentators , as well as average europeans , that greece has to answer for an original sin even though this offense was never committed . 
  establishing the truth has to be the first step to rebuilding trust . 
  please also read [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/stability_and_growth_pact#criticism )  the `` creative accounting '' gimmickry used by many countries to achieve the required deficit to gdp ratio of 3 percent , and by the immediate abandonment of fiscal prudence by some countries as soon as they were included in the euro club . 
  also , the stability pact has been watered down at the request of germany and france . 
   it 's much better that you act all butt-hurt and run away in a huff instead of actually answering . 
  there 's nothing to answer . 
  i have no prejudice on people 's opinions based on their profession . 
  i pointed out to you that this is a logical fallacy , but you seem to lack basic comprehension skills as you still want me to show how i think that stone is more `` competent '' than someone else . 
  i do n't know and i do n't care if that 's the case as it has no importance at all on his statement and the article he mentions . 
  so instead of attacking persons ( stone , weisbrot , whoever ) you should comment on the actual statement taking advantage of your `` in extenso studies of the problem '' . 
  instead you go on trying to insult me by comparing me to porn director ( lolwut ? ) . 
  i 'm going to end this conversation here as you obviously are not capable of discussing in a civilized manner . 
  have a happy life . 
   lets see you answering mine . 
  dude , you did n't even ask me a question . 
  but never mind , it 's ok , you totally convinced me with your brilliant points such as `` i actually studied the problem in extenso for a few years now '' and `` i think a little i know '' . 
  however your most convincing argument is `` you , personally , feel superior to a porn director '' , i mean you actually destroyed me . 
  i 'm done . 
  just tell me mr. 
  expert , why are you wasting your time on a shitty reddit thread when you have so much experience ? 
  ok , explain to me what makes ~ ~ oliver stone ~ ~ you more competent than ... i do n't know ... chi chi larue for instance . 
   the `` look , this director thinks we are amazing '' attitude has literally 0 value for the discussion . 
  as opposed to the value you 're bringing to the discussion ? 
  the issue is that you 're attacking him personally instead of addressing his statement and/or the article he mentioned . 
  the word `` humbug '' is often used in the german language . 
  it is usually synonymous to `` nonsense '' or `` bullshit '' . 
   for european taxpayers , a greek default has one further benefit : it sends a message to creditors that lending carries real risks , so they should be more careful in future . 
  it almost seems like this is an unthinkable notion in european politics . 
   the spending was ( mainly ) done to their advantage ( or at least to the advantage of many people ) how do you know that ?

  you do n't have the tendency of smaller countries towards safety through unity , the sense of ` belonging ' . 
  you 're not a superpower , maybe not even an industrial powerhouse like germany . 
  yet , you used to run an empire . 
  i believe that you still carry that attitude , even subconsciously . 
  i guess it 's north vs. south again then , 
  i watched all of it . 
  every single section ( even the applause when the plane lands ) applies to greece as well . 
  i mean all of them , from start to finish , exactly the same . 
  the parking , the bus , the traffic , the bureaucracy , the politics , the smoking thing , the ( non - ) queuing thing , everything . 
  judging from the comments , the same goes for many other countries as well . 
  i fear that this serious , organized ` europe ' the video refers to is really only germany and the uk . 
  hurrah !, 
  time for golden parachutes for all golden boys !, 
  you 're on a roll today , are n't you ? 
  well , the biggest expense is the rent . 
  i 'm sorry but 215 is unrealistically low , maybe it 's the area that you live . 
  also , as you say we 've come to a point that you * really * need a roommate nowadays . 
   food does n't have to include meat . 
  can it have eggs then ? 
  you have to have some protein , it ca n't be all flour and water . 
  even at 20 cents per egg ( common cheap ones ) , you 're looking at 60 cents for an 3-egg omelette . 
  what about cheese ? 
  at 7 euros per kg ( 70 cents for a piece of 100gr ) , it 's not cheap either . 
  a salad can be expensive , as well ( tomatoes are * very * expensive in greece - why ? ) . 
  i hope that you do realize that when you 're counting your cents to see if you can afford a second tomato for the night 's salad , this is when you know that you are piss poor ...  fried potatoes with salad/pasta with sauce/all kinds of cheap food can be made without a bit of meat . 
  along with bread , that 's the worst kind of food there is . 
  i do n't know about you , but if that 's all i had to eat every day , i 'd gain about 4 kg per month , no upper limit . 
  i have been * very * fat in the past and i can put it all back just by eating fried potatoes . 
  maybe you 're one of the lucky ones that can eat cheap ( and tasty ! ), 
  food and get away with it . 
  i sure ca n't . 
   bread ( enough for a day ) costs 0.60 and that 's the fancy bread . 
  in the foreign shops you should be able to find it for as much as 0.30 . 
  ( no , really ) by ` fancy ' you mean from a normal bakery , right ? 
  we do n't have any foreign shops where i live , although i 'd very much like to try some of that bread . 
   the car - well , that 's not cheap . 
  i was just thinking about the monthly cards that allow you to use whatever public transport you wish , and cost , what , 40  euros per person ? 
  you could as well buy the ones that are only for bus/tram/trol and it will be a total of 40 for both , but no metro , yeah . 
  with a little luck  you can find metro tickets at stations and use them right then , people leave them at the stairs . 
  yeah , i know . 
  i have a card . 
  it 's 45 for all means of transport ( even the subway , just not to the airport ) . 
  look , you 're talking to a guy that has already minimized all of his expenses . 
  my commuting to work includes two full hours of walking * every * day , plus another hour riding the subway . 
  half of my food comes from my parents and this does not make me proud . 
  no money left for cinema or coffee . 
  i froze my ass during the winter , since i could not afford to turn on the apartment 's heaters . 
  however , i 'm one of the lucky ones , because i am comparatively young and i do n't have any children . 
  what about those who are above 45 or have children to raise ? 
  maybe all this is normal to you , but most other people call it ` being very poor ' . 
  best of luck . 
  really ? 
  215 for a nice two room apartment ? 
  amazing !, 
  hey , do n't take my word for it . 
  take a look for yourself : [ search for two bedroom apartments ] ( http://www.xe.gr/property/search?system.item_type=re_residence&amp;transaction.type_channel=117541&amp;item.bedrooms.from=2&amp;item.bedrooms.to=2 ) just 70 for bills ? 
  really ? 
  in the last appartment i was living in i was paying : * electricity : 60 per month * phone/internet : 25 per month * water : 5 per month * common expenses ( koinoxrista ) : 30 during the summer / 120 during the winter ( heating costs ! ), 
  total : 120 during the summer / 210 during the winter . 
  just 120 for food ? 
  this is even more amazing !, 
  this means that you managed to feed yourselves ( and feed them well , as you say ) for about 2 euros per person per day . 
  this is an unbelievably low number . 
  you understand that 1 ( one ) souvlaki costs 2 euros ( in many places more ) already . 
  one spanakopita costs 2 euros . 
  a plain loaf of bread costs 1 euro . 
  a chicken sandwich costs about 2.5 euros . 
  if you are very frugal , never eat out and always cook your own food ( of course , i 'm not advocating ordering food , that 's for rich people ) , you * might * approach 4 euros per day per person ( that 's 240 per month for two persons ) . 
  double your estimate . 
  and that 's not eating well , that 's eating spaghetti with ketchup all the time . 
  keep in mind that 1 ( one ) slightly big raw pork steak will cost about 2 euros right from the butcher , already maxing out your numbers . 
  do your calculations again , maybe you have missed something . 
  100 for transport seems about right , no objections there . 
  do you own a car ? 
  what about the car 's insurance ( 200 per six months , ~ 30 per month ) . 
  what about the car 's tax ( another 10 per month ) . 
  that leaves about 60 for gas . 
  that 's not much gas . 
  i 'm not even going to mention car service , let 's say that it will never need any ( not likely ) . 
  notice that you said that * both * partners must be working in order to be able to afford a car . 
  not very likely these days , one of the two will probably be unemployed . 
  no car for single persons , then . 
  what about the rest ? 
  supermarket for example ( you know , toilet and kitchen paper , toothpaste , * maybe * some deodorant , * maybe * some shaving foam plus the million other common things a household needs , do i need to list them all ? ) . 
  clothing ? 
  any other unforeseen expenses ? 
  i do n't think i overstated my numbers . 
  your quote ( 400 for two people ) is an amazingly low estimate . 
  also , as i replied to another person , keep in mind that it is not very easy for single people over 45 to find a `` roommate '' . 
  well , actually i was being very frugal with those prices . 
  the typical cost would be more like 800 euros per month per person , no frills living . 
  this means no entertainment expenses or anything of the like , just basic living ( i.e. 
  rent , bills , gas , supermarket , some clothes * once * per year maybe ) . 
  also , how old are you ? 
  keep in mind that forty to fifty year old people can not easily ` get a roommate ' . 
  they are not twenty year olds . 
  of course the wife should get a job !, 
  the problem is that she was fired from the last one and she is waiting at the unemployment line , like the rest of us . 
  there are no jobs , remember ? 
  check out the latest unemployment statistics for greece .

  should athos fail to do so , the greek authorities can research the matter within athos . 
  athos , promptly agreed . 
  soon the first data came in !, 
  surprise , athos has been hoarding gold for thousands of years and is freaking [ rich af ] ( http://www.imma.edu.gr/macher/cache/image/athos/10449.800.jpg ) . 
  who could have guessed ? 
  except everybody . 
  then the european union came along . 
  what is going on here ? , said the eu we have a different citizenship , constitution and laws from the rest of greece , said athos . 
  f * ck said the eu . 
  what am i going to do with them , greece ? 
  do whatever said greece . 
  and that is why athos is the only `` oversees territory '' of the eu , even though it 's freaking attached to the european mainland . 
  athonians do n't vote in greek elections , and they are not greek nationals . 
  but they are legit european citizens , vote for european elections and can travel freely to all eu countries , but noone can go to athos without a visa issued by the athonian authorities . 
  but this does n't really answer the question . 
  why are n't women allowed in ? 
  because it 's their property and they do n't like women in male only monasteries , which happens to be exactly what their entire property is . 
  in the same way donald trump is n't allowed into my house because i do n't like him !, 
  that 's it !, 
  that 's all there is to it . 
  now time for some funny athonian laws . 
  in athos , all water is considered holy water , taking a bath is therefore forbidden . 
  you may not trim or shave your body hair . 
  you can only eat 2 times a day , and each meal should n't take longer than 10 minutes . 
  see ladies ? 
  now you do n't want to go there . 
  the end . 
   big part of islands are demilitatized [ who told you that ? 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hellenic_army#structure ) all but one of these treaties have expired , sovereignty fully transferred to the respective countries . 
  and the one treaty that has n't expired , the treaty of paris , is a treaty between greece and italy . 
  turkey did n't participate in any way , and italy today is totally fine with us having troops on the islands . 
  neither . 
  they would say macedonia . 
  hellas certainly exists as a concept at the time , but it 's nothing more than a cultural , historical and linguistic link . 
  it 's not a nationality . 
  much in the same way i consider myself a european , but i would n't reply to thst question : i am from europe .

   suburb we ... do n't exactly have those here . 
  in athens , there is [ athens ( singular ) ] ( https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/athens,+greece/@37.981662,23.6971784,12.5z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x14a1bd1f067043f1:0x2736354576668ddd!8m2!3d37.983917!4d23.7293599?hl=en ) which is the city of athens , capital of greece , home to the parliament , the old city of athens and a lot of government buildings . 
  it 's a single , very old municipality with a common mayor , home to less than a million people . 
  but there there is also [ athens ( plural ) ] ( https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/file:2010_dimi_athinas_numbered.svg#file ) , the metropolitan area of athens which is 35 municipalities home to no less than 3.5 million people . 
  all of these places are considered cities , collectively known as athens ( plural ) , and outside those cities it gets rural , really fast . 
  the same applies to other cities in greece , like thessaloniki , piraeus , patras and heraclion . 
  so ... are the cities surrounding athens considered suburbs ? 
  if so . 
  then [ this ] ( https://www.google.co.uk/maps/@37.9535611,23.7384667,3a,75y,202.89h,99.86t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sfd_hrc8kjp-cinzp1-gctg!2e0!7i13312!8i6656!6m1!1e1?hl=en ) is a suburb . 
  even though it 's more densely populated than athens itself . 
  maybe we should dismiss the southern municipalities as highly populated areas and say that the athenian suburbia is only at the north of athens , when there is a lot more space ... then [ this ] ( https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/athens,+greece/@38.0759949,23.8108584,3a,75y,265.06h,75.79t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1s0yekfntkdpeujr8s-0fdvq!2e0!6s%2f%2fgeo0.ggpht.com%2fcbk%3fpanoid%3d0yekfntkdpeujr8s-0fdvq%26output%3dthumbnail%26cb_client%3dmaps_sv.tactile.gps%26thumb%3d2%26w%3d203%26h%3d100%26yaw%3d6.7321649%26pitch%3d0!7i13312!8i6656!4m5!3m4!1s0x14a1bd1f067043f1:0x2736354576668ddd!8m2!3d37.983917!4d23.7293599!6m1!1e1?hl=en ) is a suburb . 
  even though it 's still a city of athens . 
  or maybe nothing inside the athenian metropolitan area is a suburb . 
  then something like [ this ] ( https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/athens,+greece/@37.8078124,23.8491057,3a,75y,336.18h,87.11t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1su1pdrpyh1rztthwcwavfuw!2e0!6s%2f%2fgeo0.ggpht.com%2fcbk%3fpanoid%3du1pdrpyh1rztthwcwavfuw%26output%3dthumbnail%26cb_client%3dmaps_sv.tactile.gps%26thumb%3d2%26w%3d203%26h%3d100%26yaw%3d37.701427%26pitch%3d0!7i13312!8i6656!4m5!3m4!1s0x14a1bd1f067043f1:0x2736354576668ddd!8m2!3d37.983917!4d23.7293599!6m1!1e1?hl=en ) or this would be our suburbs . 
  but that 's not a suburb !, 
  that 's some houses next to the beach in between little towns . 
  there really is n't any agreement on what should be called suburbs . 
  it 's not just for athens , it 's for all of greece . 
  probably the closest thing that we have to suberbs is some towns between the airport and the metropolitan area that look like [ this ] ( https://www.google.co.uk/maps/@37.9091268,23.8784167,3a,75y,169.74h,83.12t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sej4_myeeqjrwrrkb6q_3oa!2e0!7i13312!8i6656!6m1!1e1?hl=en ) but the word suburb in general as an american construct , does n't really apply in europe . 
   gambling is prohibited in turkey what ? 
  and we have n't tapped on that market yet by filling the islands with casinos and giving turks gambling visas ? 
  shame on us !, 
  i used to think that it was just a phase of the late 90s - early 2000s . 
  apparently it is n't . 
  i am so f * cking glad it is n't . 
  who fucking does n't !, 
  there are touristy places in the north ? 
  they might be from there ... 
  i would n't know ... 
  and i had to google that , honestly . 
  one family is from venice , the other is from a who cares village in the east coast . 
  i would n't remember how it 's called if i tired . 
  ok , fair points . 
  maybe it 's just me . 
  i am citizen , and a taxpayer . 
  and my judgment for varoufakis as a finance minister is negative , no going around it . 
  but i am not an economist or an academic on this field , so i do n't think that i should be the one to judge him on that regard . 
  that 's all i am saying , and it 's not unreasonable to expect others to do the same . 
  it 's to do with respect . 
  you should n't demean others , even if you disagree with them . 
  ugh ... did i say that ? 
  or implied it ? 
  i. . just do n't see it . 
   varoufakis , literally who ? 
  i am australian so i did n't know him until he was all over the news all of a sudden . 
  how am i supposed to know who he is ? 
  it 's not like he was a senior professor at the university of sidney for more than 10 years ... oh , except he [ was ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/yanis_varoufakis ) ... 
   i do n't study macroeconomics or work on monetization , but let me decide who is distinguished in that field and who is n't . 
  varoufakis is a person i did n't know until last year . 
  i also happen to disagree with him . 
  therefore , i have concluded from my extensive 2 minutes assessment that he is not a good academic , lol nope . 
   syrzia were idiots for even thinking `` anti-austerity '' was an option . 
  i do n't disagree . 
  i actually did n't vote for syriza myself , and i found the very prospect and platform of syriza ludacris from the very beginning . 
  i am not defending the opinion of syrizas plan about fiscal policy . 
  i could n't , there is no such thing . 
  but varoufakis really is one of the worlds most distinguished academics . 
  he does pioneering work with macroeconomic models and monetization schemes , and his work is behind many established and highly profitable businesses in greece and elsewhere . 
  his assessment of the problems of greece and the eurozone is very valid , and pretty much universally accepted . 
  but if anything , his appointment from an independent mp as finance minister was syrizas greatest mistake . 
  he was , from day one , not going to accept any solution but his own . 
  and his solution : haircut in return of reforms , was political suicide for other governments ... and in the end , the prolonging of the negotiation was political suicide for syriza too .

  you have to remember that syriza has only been in power for 5 months , they have shown to be up for the task though which is why people voted for them .

  [ the foreign minister of greece visited rom for the first time in 11 years recently . 
  ] ( http://www.balkaneu.com/fyrom-greece-agree-building-trust-countries/ ) if they join nato it will have nothing to do with greece 's problems but the fact that greece could use them as a potential ally . 
   germany submitted entirely and followed whatever demands its creditors wanted . 
  the creditor ( including greece ) `` demands '' were allowing germany to pay back its debt only using surplus money which is what syriza has requested this entire time . 
  here is the thing though , greece has followed every single request for budget management the last 2 years . 
  every single quarter posted a budget surplus ( before debt payments ) and greece had already lost 30 % of its economy so it had already fiscally adjusted to a lower level . 
  considering we are in a `` union '' ( lol ) , you would think that there would be some kind of common decency to accept that greeks have shown honest effort in balancing the budget and now all greece needs would be to unload some of the major debt hurdles , mainly july/august 2015 and allow for a smooth transition into long-term sustainability , removing the `` grexit '' curse from greece which would open lots of investment . 
  instead we got attemped regime change , propaganda , anti-greek media across every eu country using eu official stance as the `` right '' stance and everything greece requests as `` crazy , commie '' stuff . 
  even though tsipras handed in a 47 page reform package which introduced massive reforms , including building a 15,000 person tax agency and massive curbs to tax evasion and other major reforms . 
  after all this , the budget surplus , reform package and considering greece is in the `` union '' , you would think there would be a single fucking person in the eu to show some kind of compassion to the 60 % youth unemployed and just give them a small glimmer of hope . 
  but we got threats , anti-greek propaganda and attempted coups . 
  this is not the eu i thought it was , this eu wo n't last much longer as this is now the precedent it has set and greece must leave now before it gets stuck in the middle of the upcoming full blown eu implosion . 
  eu was a mistake and its time greece left the table before the real shit-storm happens eventually . 
  greece has had 60 % youth un-employment and 30 % general unemployment . 
  half the countries in the eu would already be in complete anarchy if this happened there , and yet crime has gone down in greece . 
  greek people are more united now than ever , the no vote was basically a peaceful revolution against the old `` system '' , which was campaigning for the yes vote backed by eu . 
  the age of retirement is 62-63 , and will most likely be raised to 65-67 this year . 
  i am sure many did retire in their 50 's in the `` good old days '' , but then again a lot of things happened then that do not any more . 
  all greeks literally work 2 hours a day in between 4 hour lunch/siesta . 
  you people are so fucking ridiculous , and i bet this gets upvoted . 
  no syriza are super commie nazi 's , the next stage of politics, 
  ok , but why do you assume there is not a major campaign to improve it ? 
  half of syriza 's proposed reforms had to do with extreme tax collection measures . 
  one of them including forming a 15,000 person tax collection agency independent from government ( reduce corruption ) and other reforms aimed at middle class tax evasion , primarily focused on promoting debit/credit transactions . 
  there have been more major tax evasion arrests while syriza has been in power then the entire last 10 years . 
  greek tax payers pay 6 % lower than eu average as % of gdp . 
  50 billion a year , where do you people get `` no taxes at all '', 
  idiot, 
  sustainability, 
  except the imf even admitted that the bailouts were never going to work in the first place . 
  the eu failed the `` trust '' when it forced upon greece the largest loan in human history to a bankrupt state and a deal which the imf even admitted was doomed to failure . 
  the constant `` grexit '' fears has destroyed the greek economy . 
  the only thing syriza is proposing was to pay the debt back in a healthy way and remove this grexit fear so investment can return . 
  instead there was ultimatums and threats to sign an unacceptable deal which would only see grexit fears continue and grow . 
  this is the `` union '' we have now , one where nations are at each others throats because they can not see common sense . 
  this is not the union that will last long , if they can not agree to restore greece an economy which has lost 30 % of gdp under troika management . 
  . how in the fuck will they manage with the incredible and much greater tasks coming soon across europe . 
  this `` union '' is only a union on paper , and it will remain that way . 
  partly true yes , but foreign investment completely ceased since the grexit fears ramped up as nobody wanted to invest due to `` grexit '' being over everyones head 24/7 . 
  signing an agreement that creditors demanded would have kept grexit fears alive and well and possibly even stronger . 
  greece proposal is to remove this grexit fear so investment can flow back in with a confidence boost , yet the creditors do not want this and want to continue the suffering which is unacceptable in this `` union '' . 
  considering the fact that greece lost 30 % of its economy and was able to cut its budget to post a budget surplus every single quarter for 2 years straight , i would think that the creditor negotiatiors would take this into consideration and make a plan where greece can manage its debt in a healthy way and remove grexit fears so everyone wins . 
  instead we get djisellbloem saying `` take it or leave it '' to tsipras with an offer that would further ruin greece . 
  it is better to exit the euro currency now while greece has already fiscally adjusted to lower gdp , instead of continuing with euro and then in the future have to deal with this shit again . 
  [ `` since the 1974 turkish invasion of cyprus , greece has spent an estimated $ 216bn ( 300 bn $ ) on armaments , although i am 100 % certain that in absolute terms its defence expenditure is much greater than official documents would show due to the so-called secret funds the state has access to , '' said katerina tsoukala , a brussels-based security expert . 
  ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/apr/19/greece-military-spending-debt-crisis ), 
  greece has been strangled through these negotiations in liquidity and foreign investment . 
  most countries would already be in civil war by this point ( you will get to see that eventually in other european nations very soon ) . 
  going to the drachma is the only way to restore stability imo , the euro and the institutions backing it have proven that the `` union '' part of the eu is nothing but a farce . 
  the average pension in greece is 500 euros , and that is used to sometimes support up to 4-5 people due to un-employment being 30 % , 60 % for youth . 
  greece had agreed to reform high cost pensions , but creditors were demanding to reduce the 500 euros to 300-400 euros and put many people in starvation . 
  most of that `` borrowed money '' went to pay for military goods , especially german ones over these last few years . 
  400-500 billion euros was spent on military equipment in a 25 years span , which is insane . 
  germany profited the most out of these military deals [ considering 15 % of germanys total military exports go to greece , and they do not want greece to cut military spending ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/apr/19/greece-military-spending-debt-crisis ) you act like greece is 100 % at fault and absolutely no outside forces contributed to this crisis , ignorance is bliss my friend .

  firstly no outside money has entered greece since august 2014 and greece has posted a budget surplus every quarter for 2 years . 
  the easiest thing syriza could have done is to sign an agreement in february for the 7-8 billion euros in eu money , but this would have only led to another crisis in a few months . 
  the best course negotiations could have gone is for a sustainable deal where greece is allowed to pay back the debt in a healthy way without further reducing the economy , which has been reduced by 30-35 % since 2011 and with 60 % youth un-employment . 
  is there not a single person in the eu who can find a middle ground ? 
  where is the `` unity '' , the same unity greece showed to germany when it forgave your debts after ww2 after the atrocities that took place in greece . 
  nobody in syriza is asking for the debt to be wiped clean , all syriza is asking is for a way to manage the debt in a healthy way so the creditors can get their money and greece is allowed to prosper . 
  if the ultimatum eu showed to tsipras with no debt management and no hope is the way eu is acting , there is no hope for the eu in the future and it is better for greece to exit now before it really gets bad in this `` union '' . 
  nobody voted to take the `` bailouts '' . 
  before the bailouts , all of greek debt was owed to private banks , and so to prevent a banking crisis across europe , instead of defaulting and possibly triggering a european crisis but could have saved greece , the government took the `` bailouts '' . 
  these bailouts swapped the private banking debt with ecb debt and now you have posts like these claiming `` greeks stole our money '' . 
  nobody in greece profited from `` your money '' , outside of a small group of elite doing insane military deals where most of this money went . 
  imf director : [ `` the bailouts bailed out the banks , not greece '' ] ( https://youtu.be/zjkvm6yc_za?t=6m49s ), 
   because the greeks do n't care about their own obligations ?? 
  how is this fair ??? 
  i do n't think a 3rd bailout is possibly or was in discussion . 
  the negotiations were for releasing the final 7-8 billion euros of the 2011 bailout . 
  as far as sacrifices , greece lost 30-35 % of gdp in 3-4 years and has 60 % youth unemployment following the troikas orders . 
  portugal lost 3-4 % of its gdp in that same time . 
  the easiest thing greece/syriza could have done is to sign an agreement in february during the 1st rounds of negotiations , they have said this themselves . 
  eu was ready to hand over the 7-8 billion no questions asked aslong as they signed the deal . 
  but all this deal would have done is extended the problem for another 6 months or year and then the next crisis would begin . 
  it is not entitlement . 
  greece is going through a great depression that is far worse than the one in 1920 's usa to put for comparison . 
  the greek side wants a deal to pay back the debt in a healthy way that could promote growth and sustainability . 
  the creditor side wants to push a deal which only kicks the can down the road for a few months/years and then greece is in an even worse situation in the future . 
  considering greece has 60 % youth unemployment , something has to be done so an entire 1-2 generations are not lost . 
  do you think greece should suffer with another 15 years of great depression because that is what greece is facing if it just blindly accepts the creditors proposal . 
  or there can be an agreement were both sides can get what they want , which is not that hard to obtain . 
  also you can not compare greek austerity to irish/portugese austerity . 
  greece lost 30-35 % of its gdp/economy in 4 years . 
  portugal/ireland lost 2-4 % . 
  oh i see , well that was confirmed today . 
  all the major parties except kke communist have given full backing to tsipras .

  this question is for europeans . 
  so i feel its alright to exclude turkey , since they are not european , and the only claim they have to europe is having 3 % of it 's country on it , while most of your country and population is disproportionately in asia . 
  that being said you do have historical ties to europe , and your food tastes good , but it does n't make you a `` european '' i do n't know why this offends you most turks would n't call themselves `` europeans '' but turkish/turkic, 
  good question . 
  but you are n't asking the right question . 
  the question you should be asking is where do irish people originate from ? 
  europe . 
  as you said there are more irish in the us than in ireland , so just because irish people now have migrated to america , does this make them native americans ? 
  ethnically european means being part of an ethnic group , native to europe , turks are ethnically asian as they originated from asia, 
  and there are more germans in the united states than cherokee indians , yet it does n't make germans native americans , turks are n't ethnically european , they are asian . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/turkic_peoples only 3 % of turkey is in europe . 
  i know turks want to be european so bad , but the fact is , you are n't european , ethnically , culturally , or politically . 
  simple solution : https://youtu.be/6cjx4gjfme0?t=72, 
  expect thessaloniki being completely gone, 
  because only 3 percent of turkey is actually geographically in europe . 
  not to mention turks are turkic , they ar n't even ethnically european and are n't a european people . 
  while albania is 100 % in europe . 
  and they are actually ethnically european, 
  why is it that every video i see of `` aslyium seekers '' being rsecured it 's all men . 
  and barely any women, 
  excluding turkey is reasonable though . 
  albania not so much, 
  have to admit , i laughed . 
  pretty sure nazism was n't muslim either, 
  nah there is a healthy amount of racism here . 
  we just sugarcoat it with jokes , and `` sarcasm '', 
  i do n't know about the winter war , but the continuation war definitely was, 
  i agree . 
  97 % of it 's country is in the middle east , it is not european . 
  you can make all the arguments about thrace being in europe ect , but the fact is , it 's a middle eastern country , and that 's just speaking geologically , when we get into politics , culture , ethnic demographics it is even more apparent just how non european it is . 
  it 's middle eastern/asian, 
  turkey is n't european , they are middle eastern http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/middle_east, 
  i meant in terms of land , not people, 
  im not sure what you 're trying to say . 
  im not blaming anyone for anything , im simply stating the reason greece has this level of obesity is due to adopting a more western life style and diet , and abandoning traditional greek lifestyle , and diet . 
  this was never a problem when i was growing up , eating fish and healthy foods , now there are mcdonalds and supermarkets everywhere . 
  that sell western food, 
  westernization is in part to blame for obesity , in any country . 
  not just greece , greeks have moved away from the traditional greek diet to a more western diet . 
  high fat foods , refined grains , a lot of dairy , processed meats , ect . 
  that is what the western diet is . 
  the greek diet used to consist of things like fish , greens , vegetables , some meat , like lamb , and ect . 
  as we , as well as many other countries adopted a more `` western lifestyle '' that diet changed . 
  yeah , it 's a pretty good sized country , about the same size as ireland i think . 
  the problem is , is that the only place people can really live is near the coast , the `` inside '' of the country is pretty uninhabitable , lava fields , sand , cold ect . 
  so the population stays pretty low . 
  it 's the westernization , this is why i still eat only traditionally greek . 
  i agree , but you and a homosexual person are both treated as equal in practice . 
  the law does not exclude homosexuals from marriage . 
  regardless if you are heterosexual or homosexual the restriction to not marry someone of the same gender applies to both of you , thus being equal . 
  before i answer i have to know if you consider races to be inherently different in anyway ? 
  and the other one can easily be said to be based on age discrimination , or some type of westermarck effect norm . 
  the fact is gays have equal rights . 
  the law applies to all people regardless of their sexuality , they ar n't being denied any right that someone else is n't . 
  why is it wrong ? 
  both are restrictions that apply to everybody, 
  could you marry your friends boyfriend ? 
  could your friend marry your girlfriend ? 
  yes . 
  you have equal rights . 
  the same restriction applies to both of you , regardless of your sexuality , if you walked into a marriage court wanting to marry another man and the restrictions said you could n't they wont recognize your marriage just because you 're straight, 
  who said anything about pedophilic marriage , i was saying if a 14 and another 14 year old wanted to marry they could n't . 
  also what 's inherently wrong about incestuous marriage ? 
  i know you 'll say sexual incestuous relations can lead to disabilities in their offspring , but what if they could n't produce offspring , what if they are gay ? 
  what 's keeping them from having sex anyway ? 
  wether they are married or not wont stop them from having sex , will it ? 
  world cup without uefa would be pretty pointless anyway, 
  fuck off kebab , you wannabee european / sarcasm, 
  i support gay marriage but technically they do have the same civil rights as everybody else , the same regulation exist for everyone regardless of gender , age , sex , ect . 
  hitler is probably turning in his grave, 
  i know right , as if it was some type of secret or something . 
  scandinavians are barbarians , barbarians means not greek, 
  i never encountered that , i have green eyes , and pretty light skin , i did once have a norwegian guy tell me because i am tall ( 6,5 ft ) that , that was proof that ancient greeks had nordic blood , because i would n't get tall genes anywhere else . 
  barbarians , am i right ? 
  you can joke about us being poor , you can joke about us being lazy , loud , ect . 
  but the second you joke about our history , shit hits the fan , thats the line you do n't cross for a greek . 
  okay fine they were scandinavian despite all physical historical evidence going against that, 
  til greeks were scandinavians ? 
  lol . 
  so basically just anglo whites ? 
  and nordic people ? 
  yeah gib money !!, 
  sweden has men still ? 
  could n't notice . 
  sad to see decedents of the vikings turn into such spineless sjw 's / s, 
  they had around 20 % of the votes for the president and i think 25 % for the european parliament with 24 seats, 
  so , anyone who dies is automatically murdered by putin now ? 
  looks like a shit hotel honestly, 
  yes . 
  i live in crete now , we use flowers too , but i know many people who use plates still as well . 
  they ar n't real plates though , they are plaster plates that are specifically made for plate throwing , they are safer and cheaper . 
  yes we do actually idk what kind of greek you are , but every wedding i have ever been to had copious plate smashing , not that many people do it any more cause its expensive but a lot of people still do . 
  my last birthday party when we where dancing everyone else was throwing plates at us . ', 
  also some festivals has plate smashing, 
  i have a siesta everyday , but im in greece , i usually take a 1-2 hour nap a day, 
  i think he 's trolling . 
  yeah it does , while cathloic church fucks up on the international scale , at least the orthodox church is nice enough to do it on a local scale . 
  i did n't see the '' / s '' for some reason , i apologize, 
  why would they downvote this , i do n't understand, 
  til people actually live in greenland,

  europeans treat the migrants like cattle and when they get fed up , shit 's gon na hit the fan . 
  but by then , they 'll be safe behind their fences . 
  we 'll have to deal with the consequences . 
  whatever , if this is what european people want , so be it . 
  i ca n't argue against a democratic decision . 
  i 'm also tired of being mad . 
  you just give up at some point . 
  europeans have been giving us the middle finger for a long time now , while their governments make it seem like they 're helping us . 
  ca n't force solidarity anyway . 
  if the europeans want to isolate us , it 's their right to do so and you ca n't force them to do anything else . 
  so `` politically '' works for turkey but does n't work for greece ? 
  you 're going full literal when it comes to greece , but turkey does n't play by the same rules . 
  i do n't know what `` politically '' means , but greeks live on those islands forever . 
  hellenic republic is the successor of those greeks , so they belong to it . 
  so `` politically '' , or whatever that means , turkey never owned those islands . 
  ottoman empire owned them ( does n't exist ) then they went to italy , then greece . 
  turkey never owned them . 
  greeks live on these islands for thousands of years . 
  how is it new that they are greek ? 
  dude looks like gaben wore those glasses as a disguise to run in the dutch elections . 
  i know it 's a joke , but consider myself triggered . 
  yeah good luck with that ... 
  well , i ca n't say anything but cyprus . 
  they speak greek , they look greek , they feel greek . 
  they 're greek orthodox . 
  but thanks uk and turkey , i guess ... 
  are you for real ? 
  you seriously think our government is that stupid ? 
  it 's a nightmare for them . 
  the political cost is insanely high and to think that they want them here is bonkers . 
  also , please show me how they can stop them without drowning them . 
  it 's the president of the czech republic . 
  his country does n't have the funds or the power to guarantee anything close to what he proposes . 
  he is just saying some random , provocative shit to attract the lowest of the low of his country 's voting population . 
  no need to look further than that . 
  i think logical , czech people know better than to listen to this . 
  of course you prefer your country 's food . 
  you grew up eating it , you learned to love it . 
  it 's just that mediterranean food is universally accepted as delicious . 
  not good enough for most americans to put above his burgers , but good enough to be his second choice . 
  most people love pizza , pasta , greek salad . 
  and french cuisine is loved by most food enthusiasts . 
  and even though it 's not my cup of tea , i can see the appeal . 
  what i 'm trying to say is mediterranean food is good enough to be the second choice for most people . 
  below their own country 's cuisine . 
  no need to apologize . 
  stereotypes in general are absurd , anyway . 
  the way you talk about people , countries , governments . 
  it 's fascinating . 
  `` let the refugees rot '' . 
  these are real people you 're talking about . 
  not a line of code in a war game . 
  real people , like you . 
  how can you talk about them like they 're cattle ? 
  who the hell do you think you are ? 
  you 're the definition of a keyboard general . 
  this is n't total war though . 
  you do n't just let a country go its own way . 
  there 's a union . 
  there are laws . 
  international treaties . 
  fuckin 12 million people living in that country . 
  it 's simple in your head because you ca n't even grasp the magnitude or the weight of the things you talk about . 
  comments like this make me question myself and the reason i browse / r/europe . 
  this is the most childish analysis of a political situation i 've ever seen . 
  how can we stop them if your country allows criminals to profit by sending them to our islands ? 
  you ca n't stop boats full of civilians . 
  maybe you should try and secure your borders and leave europe to deal with its own problems . 
  this is n't the european logic . 
  it 's the / r/europe logic . 
  there are many europeans voicing concerns about leaving greece in the current state . 
  / r/europe is just a forum . 
  one of the many . 
  and a conservative one . 
  it 's only logical that most people in here wo n't support greece . 
  also , the whole refugee crisis tends to bring out aggressive feelings from most people , mostly due to a culture of islamophobia , which starts from 9/11 all the way to the recent paris attacks . 
  and angry people tend to be louder than anyone else . 
  hence , / r/europe 's recent panic attack due to the refugees . 
  in the end , the visegrad countries and austria do n't really hate greece . 
  they hate the fact that greece ca n't really do anything to stop the refugees from coming . 
  people know that by now . 
  so , they use the greek debt crisis to support their idea that greeks are irresponsible and should n't be trusted to push their `` close the borders '' agenda . 
  the media in those countries had already plant the seeds for the hate towards greece . 
  they painted the picture of the lazy greece that eats their money and does n't want to pay anything back . 
  so their right-wing politicians did n't have to do a lot to convince their voters that it 's greece 's fault . 
  depends . 
  people count us as a southern european country but they have a hard time putting croatia in the same basket . 
  i think the term is more cultural than geographical . 
  when you say southern europe you mean great food , great wine , olive oil , loud people , black hair ( mostly ) . 
  we tick all these boxes . 
  so are we southern or eastern ? 
  people are taught a lot about ancient greece that they sometimes confuse it with the modern greece . 
  ancient greece was more open to homosexuality than the medieval , christian europe could stomach . 
  hence , greeks are homosexuals . 
  it 's a really old stereotype . 
  i 'm surprised it survives to this day . 
  that 's what you get for having an insane person like erdogan as your country 's president . 
  lots of bad diplomacy . 
  who can blame us though ? 
  nothing but love for y' all .

  please .

  there are many sites with european content . 
  besides , one-europe . info frequently publishes content from other sites . 
  post their original content only . 
  i know where the map came from . 
  this has nothing to do with what i 'm asking . 
  i 'm asking for an official list . 
  their government refuses to publish the names of the countries that allegedly recognize their constitutional name . 
  they mention random numbers without actually disclosing the names . 
  it 's ridiculous . 
  read this to understand what i 'm talking about : http://kurir.mk/en/2012/11/28/greece-to-censor-macedonias-name/  pertaining to macedonia 's recognition by third countries under its constitutional name , tsiaras says , ** `` very few un member-states '' have recognized macedonia under that name `` through exchange of verbal notes by permanent representatives of the countries in the un , even without informing their ministries of foreign affairs '' . 
  ** \u0399n other words , they 're lying . 
  i repeat my request . 
  i 'm paying ** anyone ** that will come up with an ** official ** list , with verifiable names that will ** match ** the current claimed number ( 135 ) . 
  ** i 'm serious . 
  i 'm going to be the unpleasant guy and say that although i appreciate most posts from one-europe . info , i think that you guys should stop doing this on a daily basis , because it 's on the verge of getting out of hand .

  i 'm serious . 
  your ministry of foreign affairs declines to do so for years now . 
  the recognitions you 're thinking as `` official '' are * not * . 
  edit : typo ( recognition ** s ** ), 
  austrians get pissed over a sausage . 
  do n't you think that greeks and bulgarians have more serious reasons ? 
  * macedonia is a region . 
  half of this region belongs to greece , including the core territories of the ancient macedonian kingdom , which is academically accepted as a hellenic one . 
  half of the population of the region are greeks and identify themselves as macedonians . 
  * one quarter of the population of the region , speaking a slavic language that is very similar to bulgarian , started identifying themselves as `` ethnic macedonians '' fairly recently . 
  they started appropriating symbols and historic personalities of greece , bulgaria , and albania . 
  they do n't recognise themselves as `` some '' macedonians , but as `` the '' macedonians , and think that `` their '' territories and `` their '' history is `` distorted '' and `` stolen '' . 
  * given the fragile status of the wider region , a future change in balance of power between the bigger powers might use identity and minority issues to start conflicts . 
  forcing 2.5 m greeks to accept that 1.2 m people living in the smaller part of macedonia ( region ) are now the `` only '' macedonians ( just that , no identifier ) is a ) impossible , and b ) careless . 
  it 's not a case of admiration . 
  it 's a case of lunacy . 
  these people should get a grip , accept their past and be proud of it . 
   are you trying to perpetuate the myth of the lazy greek i 'm a very proud greek . 
  i accept no myths . 
  i also accept no excuses . 
   i 'm assuming you 're correct by implying that this situation could have been avoided if the mayor was more proactive . 
  then we agree !, 
   but the main point of this article still conveys a troubling scenario ... that fuel has gotten so expensive that the mayor had to appeal for government aid to begin with . 
  it 's a state school . 
  state school always receive government aid , when needed . 
  most schools did n't have any problems .

  ** greece ** * best : feeling the weight of our history * worst : feeling the weight of our history the good thing is that we 're having 5 years of soul searching and then the only way is up . 
  i 'm just as old school as you are .

  rural mountainside greece is stunning too . 
  places like [ this ] ( http://www.greece-is.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/limnh_plastira_gp.jpg ) or meteora are beautiful . 
  belgium has managed to create a tourism thing out of [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/manneken_pis ) . 
  i mean we could milk our tourism industry even more . 
  i believe there was an effort during the late stages of the empire to create a commonwealth in the same way the anglosaxons did with their empire . 
  it would give more freedoms to bulgarians , greeks etc. 
  but turkish nationalism was starting to be a thing and some years later the nationalists formed their government in ankara . 
  the rest is history, 
  you did n't quite catch the first part about what it would mean to leave the euro or the non economic aspects of being in it . 
   turkey shot down a russian aircraft for fuck 's sake and then hid behind nato . 
  and months later erdogan visits putin for rapprochement . 
  turkey is using nato . 
  and nato is using turkey . 
  but turkey is not commited to the west . 
   cyprus was n't about an invasion in mainland greece . 
  so what ? 
  you does that justify the aggression against a sovereign state ? 
   two countries which are both heavily pro-west i am not sure turkey is * heavily * pro-west . 
  and yes war is always on the table . 
  since the 1980s the us has intervened two times to de-escalate tensions . 
   cyprus was another thing . 
  it was way before than euro and was n't about an invasion in greece i am not sure you have understand the situation enough . 
  read up on enosis . 
  cyprus was an island with a populations composed mainly of greeks . 
  there were efforts by both cypriots and mainland greeks to make cyprus a part of the greek state . 
  the whole invasion was about greece . 
  no one but turkish extremists believe that the invasions was about turkish minorities . 
  ( same tactic putin used in ukraine ), 
  where do i start ? 
  airspace violations , ciller threatening to send troops in athens or ozal sending turkish warships almost starting a war ? 
  maybe cyprus ? 
  the euro is a complicated issue for greece . 
  i personally think we should have never joined in the first place . 
  but since we are in it would be extremelly stupid to leave . 
  a new drachma would face very strong devaluation . 
  the everyday standards would drop even more . 
  having shortages of medicine would n't be fun . 
  the decision to join the euro was n't economic i believe though . 
  it was geopolitical . 
  our good ol' neighbors in the east are extremelly aggressive and have expansionist tendencies . 
  us being in the euro works are a sign of us being into the hard core of europe . 
  so messing with greece would mean much more . 
  i believe greeks at the moment are 65-35 for the euro . 
  a friend of mine is a doctor . 
  there are many patients at his door asking for his services but instead of money they are willing to pay with eggs , milk etc. 
  it is really sad to be honest . 
  the state has strangled the economy . 
  there are no investments , no companies to hire and the socialist party in power keeps giving public sector jobs in order to maintain future voters and artificially lower unemployement . 
  the problem is these workers are paid by the taxes of the helpless private sector people . 
  the church gives many handouts to those in need but that is not enough . 
  every sane businessman left has moved his business to bulgaria . 
  there is no money left in greece . 
  if greece keeps going down this path in a few years the country will be home only to pensioners , tourists and rich foreigners looking to buy cheap property . 
  no one has a right to move wherever he wants . 
  there are laws , there are borders , there is vetting . 
  free movement in the eu is a privilege we have worked for . 
  it was an agreement . 
  and in order for it to stay we should always remember how we got here . 
  it is a privilege for us eu subjects . 
  but if we start viewing it as a right then it wo n't be long untill people will say `` since immigration is a right why not let non eu subjects migrate here ? '' . 
  then the gates are open . 
  there is nothing good about syriza . 
  he is * right *, 
  [ yeap ] ( https://www.forbes.com/sites/niallmccarthy/2015/11/26/turkish-jets-violated-greek-airspace-over-2000-times-last-year-infographic/#7b522cd542e3 ) it went crazy [ during the days ] ( http://greece.greekreporter.com/2017/02/02/greek-defense-ministry-turkey-violates-airspace-138-times/ ) that greece refused to give back the alleged coup plotters too, 
   but i remember greeks themselves threatening to allow migrants through only one extremely stupid minister said that . 
  and as expected nothing happened . 
   i 'm not immediatelly aware what you mean . 
  the moment they cross the border as refugees there is a set of rules we have to follow . 
  this is why they use a very evil tactic . 
  they get in using inflatable boats and then we they see they border patrol they damage the boat with knives practically sinking themselves . 
  then we are obliged to save them . 
  when they are in our hands the international rules apply . 
   maybe we should instead blame greece and bulgaria for being incapable or unwilling to secure their borders . 
  i would justify your ignorance if you were belgian or dutch . 
  but no . 
  you are latvian . 
  you know how borders actually work . 
  how is supposed greece and bulgaria to defend sea borders ? 
  are you aware of the dublin regulation ? 
  and do n't miss my point about border violations . 
  how is violating eu borders talk and not action ? 
  how is using immigrants as leverage when striking deals talk and not action ? 
   ** would end ** turkey eu accession calling eu members nazis , violating eu borders , using immigrants as leverage to blackmail the eu is not enough ? 
  smh, 
  so on the one hand you guys bash trump for calling nato absolete and willing to call out freeloader and on the other hand you think nato is not working for you and that nato suggestions and agreements are irrelevant and that you would prefer to leave nato if the 2 % was mandatory . 
  i am pretty sure i am not the only one identifying a problem here . 
  everyone who does n't feel the need to intervene when his neighbor 's house is on fire will soon watch his own house burn . 
  because this is a deal we 've made . 
  we are talking about percentages not amounts . 
  at the moment of 5 countries reach that threshold . 
  united states , 3.61 % greece , 2.38 % britain , 2.21 % estonia , 2.16 % poland , 2 % you would say estonia or greece are justified because of their bullying neighbors . 
  but what 's the point of the alliance then if we ca n't even meet our agreement standards ? 
  we could all just sign defence agreement with the us independently . 
  but no we prefer nato as a broader defence agreement . 
   hell , nato countries are so armed , that no one would ever think of attacking a nato country . 
  you mean the us is so armed that no one would ever think of attacking a nato country . 
  it would matter because you could be from finland for instance which is not a nato country . 
  i 've seen swedes here not knowing that they are not part of nato . 
  so portugal . 
  you are in a continent where its most influencial geopolitical power is russia .

  instead , they decide to charge more vat . 
  that 's why we say that these austerity measures do n't work, 
  i do n't know . 
  perhaps they mean the vat and businesses able to avoid giving it to the goverment . 
  the way the whole receipt system works provides loopholes that they take advantage . 
  greeks do n't use plastic money and it 's really hard to keep track of transactions done by cash . 
  we all have credit cards or debit but we rarely use them . 
  we are used with cash, 
  only police and military people get early retirement here ( i do n't agree ) . 
  also people that work in mines and generally really unhealthy jobs like that ( i agree ) . 
  as far as i know , the others get over 62 at least with most people 65 and 67, 
  the programs and loans simply do n't work . 
  we have been saying that all along . 
  regardless , we were doing better until the last elections when syriza came . 
  i am not saying that it 's totally their fault but both sides are to blame . 
  different philisophy that was not liked by many in europe . 
  now , most people say that the new deal will work but i disagree . 
  60 % chance we will be talking about this again next year imo, 
  what ??? 
  how ?? 
  fixed . 
  i like the interaction with my fellow europeans and reading about other countries from their citizens first hand . 
  i also like [ this pic . 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/0trhkui.jpg ) i dislike the sudden greek hatred coming from a lot of redditors . 
  everything we say is a lie except if a ** foreign ** source confirms it :(, 
  i am sick and tired of answering questions like that on reddit . 
  what do you think we do ? 
  a nation of thieves ? 
  hide the money and pay 0 taxes ? 
  we are paid through the banks . 
  the tax people know how much we get and charge us the amount . 
  you ca n't just hide the paycheck or the house you own . 
  i own a business and i have to pay througb the banks . 
  i ca n't hide anything . 
  stop saying we are lazy and do n't pay taxes . 
  i can show you my tax bill last year and i bet you 1000000 euros that i paid more than you . 
  enough already !, 
  best federation ever . 
  we would fight who gets to fuck up first lol, 
  same here, 
  all greeks agree that the public sector needs fixing and that 's where mainly the problem is . 
  the problem is not greeks not paying taxes but the whole world thinks that 's the problem . 
  the country wastes way to much money to function . 
  it 's like having a really old car that burns 1000 litres of gasoline per km and sticking with it instead of buying a new economic car . 
  the way the last programs work is by killing the private sector by overtaxing them , lower the low wages even more and the money goes to pay the public sector and the loans . 
  the new program has some nice plans but also has even more taxes to the private sector . 
  the small business that remained will now close as well and the big companies that did n't leave greece these past years will now have to leave . 
  even more people out of work . 
  one of the good thing that this goverment did was give the people a chance to pay the taxes they owed by spliting payments for up to 100 months ( depending on the amount ) . 
  the new deal makes the goverment cancel that because they did n't ask the europeans ' opinion on that . 
  the results were amazing but now they have to scrap that, 
  exactly the same in greece, 
  - `` if you all please watch the tv '' - '' i ca n't see . 
  some leader 's head is blocking it '', 
  the union as eu was fine . 
  the common currency complicated things though . 
  not everyone was prepared . 
  countries that are supposed to join the ez now have second thoughts, 
  completely wrong . 
  by the time you get electricity then the house is considered finished and the taxes are paid . 
  the metal you leave on top is in case you decide to build another floor and connect it to make it solid . 
  we have tons of earthquakes . 
  do you also think that people cut electricity to avoid taxes ; lol, 
  read my comment above, 
  wtf . 
  the reason you see the houses unfinished is because you do n't have as much money . 
  some fathers start the houses for their kids to finish . 
  they have no money to built the whole thing so they at least get the property , the permit and put the cement . 
  those things alone could cost a fortune . 
  edit : downvote all you want but that 's the truth . 
  also read my other comment below about electricity and taxes, 
  i do n't like tsipras but he is the prime minister so i support him in his european venture . 
  the people who i do n't support and never will are konstantopoulou , kammenos and varoufakis . 
  the first two because they are money hungry bastards , narcisists and they should just get lost and varoufakis because he has no place in politics . 
  you make it sound like greece has done nothing these past 5 years which is totally not true . 
  [ there you go ] ( http://www.cycladia.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/fix2.jpg ), 
  i thought that we ( greeks ) broke it since we are on the front page a lot, 
  do n't worry . 
  young people are totally retarded everywhere  i was a teenager once :'(, 
  that was before things turned to shit . 
  things were poo . 
  now things are shit . 
  there is a difference, 
  hugo boss ? 
  sorry the source is in greek . 
  there were also `` no '' rallies last night but most say the crowd was bigger tonight, 
  i would n't believe that source . 
  edit : really ? 
  efimerida syntakton ? 
  a reliable source ? 
  downvote all want but that paper is crap, 
  or take some needed measures at the moment and then work out a plan to get out of the euro without pissing on the people by defaulting . 
  i am sure that if they all work together they could find a way, 
  nobody knows except them but one thing is for sure . 
  the plan failed to save greece . 
  austerity did n't work, 
  i think the most important thing that people forget is that syriza is a far left party . 
  so you want tsipras to kick out the far-left voices in a far left party ? 
  just a quiet summer week ... 
  people have lost everything the past few years in greece , the suicides have increased by 100000000000 % and things are only getting worse .

  breaking news : * countless tourists are complaining about headaches while being on vacation in greece . 
  [ what i saw from varoufakis back in 2015 is the same proposal that the imf is bringing to the table right now . 
  ] ( https://www.yanisvaroufakis.eu/2015/06/18/greeces-proposals-to-end-the-crisis-my-intervention-at-todays-eurogroup/ ) as for the rest ... i am sure schauble and the other financial ministers are acting like gentlemen and if i remember correctly he was critisized for talking economics ... in the fucking eurogroup . 
  if that is a bad behavior then i rest my case . 
  we are talking about a time that media chose to talk about his leather jacket than the actual point of the whole conversation . 
  the guy was clearly assasinated by the media and by his fellow finance ministers because they had something to gain from it . 
  the financial ministers of europe are pissed with the guy that says that the program they have invested so much political capital in , has failed ? 
  do n't tell me ... !, 
  initially the imf would n't agree to take part at all , so the europeans made some compromise . 
  now the imf agreed to take part so greece can take some money but they will only pay when the greek debt becomes sustainable ( aka europeans give a debt relief ) . 
  so , macron had nothing to do with it . 
  greece not taking the next payout because of imf did the trick . 
  no ... the proposal was 3,5 % primary surplus for many more years . 
  the imf was n't even on board to that and it got lowered down . 
  ** now the imf agreed to take part but will only give money when they believe the debt is sustainable **  `` i will be proposing to the imf executive board the approval in principal of a new precautionary stand-by arrangement for greece , '' imf managing director christine lagarde said . 
  she added that the amount of this program will be `` probably in the range of $ 2 billion '' ** that would depend on debt-relief measures materializing . 
  imf not giving money effect ... let 's stop pretending that macron will come and save the day . 
   rewarded xd, 
   i mean , the fact that with 35k you are poor as fuck signifies the difference in salary . 
  the middle class in us earns minimum 70k per year and while in us it may not be that great due to cost of living where did you get this number ? 
  70k is not the average salary . 
  it 's the average salary for someone with barchelor and mostly at rich states . 
  half of that is the average and the poverty line is at 22k . 
   it also isnt uncommon to live 15-20 years in us then go to another country for retirement or to open a bussiness because your savings will be goddamn huge in these countries . 
  you really overestimate how much the average american is saving . 
  more than 50 % of americans do n't even have retirement savings ( let 's not talk about that ) and only [ 15 % have more than 10k at their bank ] ( https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/229420/average-american-savings-account_large.png ) . 
  add to that student loans , house loans etc and you are fucked . 
   im repeating what i said above . 
  i recognize that the above guy didnt mention healthcare and education but it is still not enough to compensate the enormous gap between the salaries or the financial opportunities that us provides you are wrong . 
  when you need 50k + just for study fees and when a simple [ cancer ] ( https://costprojections.cancer.gov/annual.costs.html ) treatment costs dozens of thousands of dollars , then , it is worth it . 
  let 's not talk about transportation , parks and various other public assets that northerners enjoy . 
   there are multiple programms for poor people . 
  also if you are poor its bad everywhere , not just us let 's put it this way ... a poor person would prefer to live in canada/north europe than us . 
   imagine that 30-35k is being considered a pretty damn good annual income in every european country whereas 30-35k in us barely reaches minimum salary levels . 
  especially if you live in a big city . 
   p.s : talking about income after taxes now ... you do n't even mention the cost of living and the inequality among states . 
  if you live in seattle or new york with 35k you are poor as fuck . 
  i lied . . you are freaking homeless . 
  did you end up in hospital ? 
  how pitty ... we will punish you . 
  [ consider paying 200 fucking dollars for a teddy bear ] ( http://upriser.com/posts/family-fighting-a-474000-hospital-bill-got-charged-200-for-a-teddy-bear ) . 
  now let 's not talk about the marvelous student debts that will follow you for the rest of your life , the working rights etc. . . do you have financial difficulties ? 
  for the society you are `` white trash '' and you will get zero help ... good fucking luck . 
  i would prefer northern europe in a heartbeat . 
   i mean the salaries in all of northwestern europe , except maybe switzerland , are paltry as fuck compared to us you ca n't be that ignorant ... please . 
  the irony ... 
  i know it sounds good but many times gdp is n't an indicator of how well the economy is doing despire what we hear .

  he means why so many people see it as threat ( 23 -  19 is very close ) . 
  or at least that 's what i understand . 
  ok ... so if you had to seperate europe based on the geographical position of each country , greece would be in western europe ? 
  a ) people do n't view americans that favorably . 
  there are some evidence that the dictatorship of greece in 1967 was supported by the cia . 
  b ) nato did n't help at the invasion of cyprus . 
  c ) nato does n't do anything for the daily violations of the airspace and sea borders by turkey . 
  are n't we in eastern europe ? 
  yeah ... you completely missed the point . 
  i never said that greece is not to blame . 
  did i say otherwise ... ? 
  i argued that the german corporations that do business in greece are not saints . 
  corruption will only get worse with austerity anyway . 
  [ the uncorrupted german corporations ladies and gentlemen ... ] ( https://www.euractiv.com/section/justice-home-affairs/news/ngo-german-firms-mired-in-worst-greek-corruption-scandals-since-wwii/ ) ps . 
  bring back christoforakos or i ll burn all your white socks and sandals . 
   golden dawn did n't offer help only to gd members either . 
  it offered it to anyone who had a greek id . 
  which is obviously a way to gain easy votes . 
  they were/are targeting people that can vote . 
   again , it 's a very common recruitment and community building tactic extremist groups use . 
  the only reason you call it philanthropy is because it 's far leftists doing it and not neonazis . 
  besides that , there is literally no difference . 
  you sound like you did n't really read what i said . 
  immigrants wo n't help anarchists . 
  they offer nothing to their cause since they are not here to stay . 
   if you want philanthropy , go offer social support without any political posturing . 
  that would be philanthropy . 
  i have done it myself and it helps a lot of people . 
  know what i did n't do when i did that ? 
  i did n't wear a nd pin and tell people how awful socialism is while doing it . 
  yeah that 's fair , but since they are not hurting anyone and helping everyone i do n't see the problem . 
  yeah ... you ignore some crucial things . 
  there is a huge difference between what golden dawn or any other far-right group is doing with anarchists . 
  they are helping immigrants that offer nothing to their cause . 
  they wo n't join them , they wo n't vote for them , they wo n't help them and they will probably never see them again . 
  what you call `` targeting '' in the case of anarchists is what i call philanthropy . 
  they have occupied a building next to my house . 
  if you ignore the fact that the music they play is terrible , they are fine . 
  i often see them carrying sandwitches and juice and distribute them to homeless people . 
  i do n't expect people here to say `` well done '' tho . 
   greece can ask for any interest rate it wants for its government bonds . 
  it 's just that nobody will buy it at the low levels . 
  that 's just a matter of supply and demand . 
  it also has nothing to do with them having euro - it 's because they overspent and crashed their economy . 
  in any case ecb is actually offering them money at below market rates .

   so , why did you kick your government then , exchanging it for an anti-reform one ? 
  because most people deemed 5 years is enough to give a set of measures time to show any ( and i mean ** any ** ) type of improvement . 
  if the previous government could say , hey look at what we 've accomplished . 
  never mind how minute , but something tangible , there would not have been a new government . 
  instead you know what we got ? 
  reports on new tax increases , new recessionary measures , new cuts .

   i remember coming to the dinner and i 'm looking at my blackberry . 
  it was a f *** ing disaster in europe . 
  french bank stocks were down 7pc or 8pc . 
  that was a big deal . 
   for me it was like , you were having a classic complete carnage because of people saying : crisis in greece , who 's exposed to greece ? 
  i said at that dinner , that meeting , because the europeans came into that meeting basically saying : ` we 're going to teach the greeks a lesson . 
  they are really terrible . 
  they lied to us . 
  they suck and they were profligate and took advantage of the whole basic thing and we 're going to crush them . ',

  why did [ oecd put greece first in their attempts for reform ] ( http://blogs-images.forbes.com/stevekeen/files/2015/02/image0011.png ) ? 
   that 's exactly why there wo n't be debt relief . 
  if there 's debt relief for greece , there has to be debt relief for italy , or spain , or portugal . 
  it sets a precedent . 
  there is no need only for debt relief . 
  debt restructuring is also feasible . 
  there 's this thing called inflationary default . 
  push the debt far into the distance and inflation would cut a part of it . 
  and no one would actually * feel * it . 
  as for the precedent . 
  do you think other countries are willing to reach greek levels of destruction in order to get a debt relief ? 
  is any politician willing to push his country into 30 % loss of gdp , 30-40 % salary reduction , unemployment etc etc ( you 've heard it plenty of times ) just to get a x % debt write-off ? 
  or if another country reaches greece 's levels of a crisis do you think that the problem would be a second debt relief ? 
  if such thing happened , then the euro project has a problem . 
  it 's not * just * greece , then it 's a structural problem . 
  debt relief would n't be very high on the agenda . 
   the certainty of a grexit appears to lower bond yields for the ez countries , the markets are seeing that the euro is not being sacrificed to entertain recalcitrant members . 
  no one would want to follow in greece 's path . 
  but it might be unavoidable . 
  consider that there is such strong dissent concerning the debt relief on some of the greek debt . 
  and that 's mostly peanuts for titans like the german economy . 
  how probable would be a debt relief in a worst case scenario for a country the size of italy ? 
  not happening . 
  you are misinformed . 
  the vote had nothing to with paying the debt or not . 
  having said that here 's why greece leaving the ez might prove destructive for the other members as well : greece leaving means ez is not infallible and that if another country has similar problems , then that country could follow the same path . 
  that is problematic because uncertainty means bond yields will become larger , so countries will have more expensive loans . 
  more expensive loans means the problems will become larger . 
  larger problems means even more expensive loans and you get the point . 
  apart from that , there is the issue of defaulting . 
  greece defaulting will be painful but manageable . 
  what would happen if say italy with a $ 2.8 t - a 10x larger debt than greece - would follow the same path ? 
  italy has 130 % debt to gdp right now , greece had 120 % when the crisis blew up . 
  italy is in a way better position of course since it has an actual industry , but if we consider the previous circumstances , loans getting more and more expensive , it 's not out of the question . 
  damn , we 've been having quite a show this year . 
  all these `` personalities '' , it 's political drama + big brother + thriller + soap opera all in one . 
  it would prove an annoyance , nothing more . 
  that is not so strong to bend the will of 18 other nations . 
  that 's essentially a myth . 
  yes there is oil in greece , it 's enough to worth exploiting but by no means will it transform us into saudi arabia over night . 
  estimations put the revenue of the new oil exploitation sites at ~ [ $ 15b under 30years ] ( http://www.ekathimerini.com/168809/article/ekathimerini/business/greeces-energean-looks-at-offshore-tenders-amid-russia-interest ) . 
  sure it 's good pocket change , but nothing more . 
  it does n't matter . 
  and if did matter , it 's still our fault . 
  it does n't matter . 
  that is probably the only reason we still have talks . 
  her ... issue is the devil , 666 and all that good stuff . 
  i started writing a joke about sending him a check and how it would solve some problems . 
  but the situation is so volatile , people might think i actually mean it . 
  the problem i see is that tsakalotos - in contrast with varoufakis - is a party member and has been for quite a while . 
  varoufakis objections during the negotiations were economic based . 
  tsakalotos may have political objections as well though . 
  but again , tsipras seems hellbent on finding a solution , our country is just before the brink , i do n't think there 's room here for political concerns on the negotiation . 
  thanks for this .

   greek redditors , what kind of paper is protothema , is it comparable to bild ?

  yeah , if you want a debate in greek , head to / r/greece, 
   actually , the deal syriza ended up with is much tougher on greece than what was on the table before the referendum a few weeks ago , not to mention back in february . 
   but hey , they got to play politics with the big boys for a few months . 
  if it makes you feel better * to believe * that greece got a worse deal than it would have 2 weeks ago , i am happy for you .

  is it safe to assume that you have moved further to the left ? 
  edit : no accusation or anything , just curiosity . 
    this means that greece will never be able to repay its debt . 
   but is n't that going to be the case either way ? 
  forget the debt . 
  you need an economy first . 
  debt payment can only come later . 
  not having an agreement on repaying national debt leads to having the same problems argentina is currently experiencing ... 
  i am not a suriza supporter but i support the current greek government in their effort to stir the greek economy in a different direction . 
  the main problem with greece existing the eurozone is that the euro would gain against other currencies substantially ( except in case of future speculation for itexit or spexit ) but our debt is now in euros under english law . 
  this means that greece will never be able to repay its debt . 
  and that would mean being blocked from the global banking system , which would severely hinder transnational economic transactions . 
  it will be tough , but preferable to subjugation in any case . 
  wow . 
  whoever came up with `` those who forget history are bound to repeat it '' was n't kidding ... 
  oh , this a good question :-) maybe we should get out while we still can !, 
  [ you could have been a bit more accommodating and explained why ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3d1wri/sch\u00e4uble_on_the_board_of_the_development_bank/ct113pu ), 
   we 're hearing a lot about how greece has lost the trust and credibility . 
  i think rather that germany has lost these now , especially with the two proposals from yesterday . 
   we have found out that both sides are ` kids ' , with no real direction or vision for the future . 
   this crisis has firmly made me into an opponent for the euro in bulgaria . 
  we suck at our own governance and fiscal policy , but at least i can attempt to vote out anyone here i do n't like . 
  i ca n't touch sch\u00e4uble , and relying on a foreign electorate to help me out is not a position i want to be in . 
  i must agree with everything you said . 
   in recent history that is like saying `` who is the tallest kid in the classroom '' , in a school with 1000 students . 
  i 'd like to know who is the tallest kid in the entire school instead ... 
  what would happen if all * other * countries re-adopted their own national currencies * except for * greece ? 
  think outside of the box for a moment . 
  greece is trapped in debt in euros ( a currently very hard currency ) that she can not repay . 
  the other ez members also have a lot of debt in euros . 
  if all other countries would re-adopt their national currencies at the same time , the value of the euro would plummet and the debt would shrink as a proportion of gdp for every country with the new currency . 
  then greece could file bankruptcy and start paying her debts with massively inflated euros . 
  win-win for the whole of europe :-) p.s. 
  this is simply a humorous suggestion and should not be taken seriously by anyone ... 
  alright , i just tried to lighten the mood with a joke :-), 
  for the sake of the future of the eu , let us truly hope so . 
  edit after 24 hours : well , looks like it was true all along . 
  tomorrow begins a new era for europe , and it does n't look bright . 
   sch\u00e4ubles idea  legaly questionable inconceivable !, 
   the right sector released a note where they 're calling for support from the ukrainian people and asks the ukrainian army not to attack them , if they will be given that order . 
  ah , paramilitaries doing their thing then !, 
  carry on !, 
  if there is going to be a grexit , there are not going to be any terms . 
  they will cut off everything and we will have to fend for ourselves . 
  he could have done what t did . 
  or he could have been smarter even and announce his intention for a referendum at the end of the negotiations once he had started negotiating . 
  either way , he took away power from the greek government ( power given to them by the greek people ) and gave it to extranational institutions . 
  no prime minister should have that right . 
  you are right , papandreou should not have let himself be blackmailed into not doing what was best for his country ( assuming he honestly wanted to make a referendum ) . 
  he should have done the right thing and put the question to the people of greece . 
  but he did not . 
  he failed his country . 
  no no no , do n't be absurd . 
  they can sue you in international courts if you do n't give compensation . 
  but nothing stops you devaluing your currency 10 times * after * you have given * compensation * ... 
  if the european politicians had let greece have a referendum in 2010 , none of this would have happened . 
  the european taxpayers would not have been cheated out of their money ** on the insistence of their own politicians ** and no `` help '' need have been extended to greece at all . 
  bankruptcy and drachma then would have lead to 5 tough years and a healthy economy today . 
  if there is one thing i credit papandreou of doing right , is that he mentioned a referendum in 2010 . 
  had he gone through with it , we would not have been in this situation now . 
   tsipras would rather sit in shit than work a shovel . 
  how about * you * work some shit with a shovel instead of typing sly remarks ? 
  got us here so far !, 
  oh i really hope so . 
  and any compensations payed in drachma !, 
  well , greek people do not often plan for the future but we are at least adept to responding as situations unfold . 
  creative chaos if you will :-), 
  well , i do think alex is smart but is he really * that * s ** m ** art ? 
   free movement of greek citizens in other eu countries . 
  yes . 
  they will need to apply for a visa . 
  tough . 
   common market and tax on imports/exports . 
  european products would become more expensive . 
  greece would have to import from somewhere else .

  i 'd suggest you find a different way to defend your government 's statements . 
  whataboutism never works . 
   that 's why it protests turkish intervention of cyprus which was done according to the treaty of zurich , right ? 
  tell me about it lol . 
  i have told you what greece 's objection is . 
  read it again . 
  greece does n't even have to recognize the `` intervation '' cause it stopped being an intervention and became an occupation . 
  how can greece accept a hypothetic scenario and ignore the outcome ? 
  greece accepts the reasons turkey had to intervene , it simply does n't recognize what happened after that . 
  i know that it 's very convenient to you to talk about the first day but you never replied about turkey ignoring the ceasefire and occupying 40 % of the island , or about the turkish settlers it brought . 
  i understand why you would n't want to comment on that but yes it shows that as it turned out , it was n't just an intervention , but an occupation . 
  it would have been an intervetion if they went and left without occupying anything . 
  learn the difference . 
  once again you failed to talk about the aegean dispute and talked about irrelevant things . 
  either stay on topic or give up . 
  for the last time , you 're talking about some people that only you say are a majority , and i have told you you 're wrong but you decide not to believe me , whatever . 
  i can use people turks say on the internet to make some pretty interesting generalizations about your country as well but it 's childish and frankly stupid . 
  then again , i understand that you 're getting desperate here since your own government is officially claiming greek islands so it 's hard to come back from that . 
  learn to tell the different and stop trying to twist things to protect your country 's imperialism and expansionism . 
  greece is going according to the international law . 
  turkey is n't . 
  your maps prove that and since you mentioned cyprus , the fact that no other country other than turkey recognizes the occupied part of cyprus , also shows exactly that . 
  if greece does n't give a fuck about the international law , urge your government to take the aegean dispute into the international court of justice and see what happens  have a great day amigo . 
  all your points have been refuted repeatedly , you keep avoiding the point of the article and bringing up irrelevant things to justify your government 's policy and statements . 
  there 's no point in repeating what i have already typed many times . 
  if you actually believe that greece 's policy is to retake istanbul , preach on . . no one will take you seriously . 
  if you wish to get back to the original point which you abandoned right after you saw what the treaties and the international law says about the dispute , be my guest . 
  no point in derailing this any further . 
   and although turkey acted upon the treaty ( at least the first part , right of intervention ) , today 's greece strangely protests turkey . 
  greece protests because turkey acted way beyond the treaty . 
  turkey violated the ceasefire and conveniently went from occupying 3 % of cyprus to occupying almost 40 % of it , even though hostilities had ended . 
  furthermore , turkey illegally brought in settlers from mainland turkey to live in the grossly disproportionately ( considering the island 's demographics ) occupied lands which is a clear violation of the geneva convention . 
  in other words , turkey went from simply intervening ( which is how it likes to call it ) , to straight out occupying almost half the island and bringing settlers to solidify the division and occupation of cyprus . 
  anyway , that 's a completely different topic that you brought up because you found a wall regarding what the international law states about the aegean dispute . 
   society believes in this . 
  tell me that i am wrong , are n't there people in greece who believe mongols have occupied istanbul ? 
  tell me i am wrong . 
  be honest . 
  dude i can even find street interviews from youtube if you like ? 
  let us not play the dumb come on . 
  no , you 're not wrong . 
  the thing is you 're not wrong if you say that there are people that believe in lizardmen . 
  so if you 're claiming that the greek society believes that if we had a larger army we should initiate a megali idea 2.0 , yes you 're completely wrong . 
  if you 're saying that the turks came from central asia to conquer constantinople , that 's a fact , i do n't know why you 're objecting to that . 
  the fact that some people are bitter that constantinople was lost does not in any case translate into greece wanting to re-take it . 
  it 's gone , it belongs in the past . 
  the only people that will tell you otherwise are ultra-nationalists which are by no means the majority of the population , or people poking the `` remove kebab '' , `` gib istanbul '' , or `` 1453 was an inside job '' kind of meme fun . 
   turks have zero interest in conquering athens , while `` liberation of constantinople '' has become a folk legend in greece . 
  tell me one thing that turks could find sentimental in athens . 
  i can find 9999 things from turkey which are sentimental to an average greek . 
  quit avoiding the topic and spiraling over the same bullshit argument . 
  it 's not a matter of it being athens or istabul . 
  turkey has officially claimed greek land , while greece has n't claimed turkish land . 
  it 's very simple . 
  stop talking about athens as if that removes the fact that the turkish government has talked about islands under occupation . 
  it 's making you sound bad . 
   your defense minister actually tried to revive the crisis of imia again . 
  how ? 
  if i remember correctly it was your armed forces general hulusi akar that did that by sailing on the islands at the `` crisis 's anniversary '' . 
  our minister flew over the islands right after that . 
  if anything it was your side that tried to revive the crisis . 
   come on man , do not expect me to believe this , come on !, 
  if one half of a greek 's heart lies under parthenon , other half lies under hagia sophia . 
  i have been to your country dude , i have greek friends . 
  i know you guys . 
  i am from fucking smyrna myself , i can hear your radios here , we are that close to each other . 
  no need to say things like `` no greek cares about constantinople '' , come on . . is that why it has become a religious folk tale ? 
  the religious folk tale has been there since 1453 . 
  i explained in my previous comment . 
  yes people are sensitive about constantinople cause it used to be our old `` capital '' . 
  that would be the case with many nations . 
  it 's a significant part of our history is that 's expected . 
  but like i explained , very few people actually want to retake it . 
  every sane greek realizes that it 's a thing of the past . 
  would it be cool if we retook it ? 
  sure . 
  would n't it be cool for you guys if something happened and expanded in greece ? 
  yes , how would that be bad for you ? 
  does that mean that your majority wants to take athens ? 
  you do however have claims over other parts . 
   by whom ? 
  nato , yes . 
  usa would prevent that . 
  by average people ? 
  as i said , half of their hearts are under hagia sophia . 
  it is a very important figure for a greek . 
  no , i 'm talking internally . 
  any government that would suggest that would automatically crumble . 
  simply put , greece does n't pursue any kind of conflict or idea of occupation . 
  it 's just the country 's mentality . 
  kind of like with germany . 
  perhaps it 's weird for you to understand that cause you 're from turkey ( and i 'm not saying this as an insult , but turkey 's policy is quite different ) . 
   one is a populist speech given to get votes ( and not done jack shit on later ) while the other is a common belief in greece which you are denying for some reason . 
  `` just a populist speech to get votes '' ... 
  i can just imagine hitler being all like `` we need to exterminate the jews and conquer more lands !! '', 
  and germans being like `` calm down guys , he 's just saying that to collect votes , it 's all good , nothing to worry about '' . 
  see what i 'm saying ? 
  populist speech or not , it establishes the idea and precedent if you like , that there are islands that greece is occupying which is retarded , and this can be used now or in the future accordingly . 
  so while you might perceive is as a populist speech , greece does n't care . 
  it affects her directly .

  but you help when you can . 
  in case you did not notice we are poor and on the verge of collapse . 
  we are not in a posistion of doing charity work , especially if this is done in the expense of tax-paying citizens . 
  if there is enough capacity then let all the world enter . 
  when there is great shortage you make sure that you have a fair and undisputable selection process . 
  maybe you should talk with some greek people that were declined a place in the kinderkarten and now are at a dead end because the second parent can not work and they can not afford a private school . 
  i think i made it clear that this is not a racist matter as you portray it to be . 
  so , it is not a violation . 
  nothing bad can come out of simple numbers . 
  so it is not unreasonable to ask for it . 
  but you suggest that this question shall not be answered because gd has asked . 
  if for example another party asked for it should be ok ? 
  you say that the number is low . 
  how does anyone know since they are now gathering the data ? 
  if they know the number just state it and there is no reason to make all that fuss . 
  if that number is low/acceptable it will be decided by the people . 
  so the parties are doing their job in the parliament . 
  they ask questions that the goverment is legally obliged to answer . 
  they do this on matters that think they are problematic . 
  then the answer is publiced and the voters decide if they are happy with the performance of the goverment on this matter with their vote . 
  so after ignoring you generalisations i will say to you that this question should be answered like all other questions . 
  nothing dangerous about that . 
  let 's not forget that the same question was answered in the past to another party . 
  and finally the people will decide if the number is high/low , acceptable/unacceptable . 
  i will read carefully the link you provided and i will comment . 
  but i have to say that these data are always available in other eu countries and not gathered upon request . 
  do you suggest that all other countries are in violation ? 
  so ... they will not provide the statistics requested . 
  not names ... not adresses ... nothing ... just the statistics . 
  the answer that will be given in the parliament will be in the form of simple statistics . 
  since when , providing the percentage of something is a violation of privacy ? 
  except if they refuse because they have something to hide and they fear public outrage . 
  well , it is a question officially made in the parliament . 
  the goverment has to answer all questions . 
  i do not think that any sensitive data are required . 
  after all these are data that should have been available without asking . 
  data about all public institutions should already be available . 
  but then again ... greek goverment was not able to answer the simple question of how many public sector workers are on the payroll ... they would be able to gather statistics about schools and kindegartens ? 
  even if wages hit 100 euro/month greece wo n't be a good place to invest . 
  it is wrong to focus on labor cost when there are several other factors that deter a business to invest here . 
  there are many other countries that are ` cheaper ' to invest but i do not see the investors queuing in their doors . 
  it is because they , like greece , do not meet other criteria that businesses are looking for . 
  labor cost is just one of the many . 
  ok , first i would like to say that you are right in some aspects . 
  greek people like to go around the rules if that benefits them . 
  not all of them . 
  ( btw paying to get a driving license does not apply - all the people i know paid nothing to get it ) my opinion , and that is not to justify the situation is that greek people are as corrupt as any other nation . 
  the different levels of corruption between countries is how easy it is for ordinary people to ` bend the rules ' for their benefit . 
  if you know that you can do something and get away with it easily then you will probably do it . 
  people need to be scared of the consequences to do the right thing . 
  unfortunately , very few people will do what is moraly right just because . 
  take as an example the person that is giving the driving licenses . 
  it will take a bribe to give you the license or you risk failing . 
  ( this is just an example - since you mentioned it ) as a public worker , he/she has the benefit of job security . 
  yes , public workers can not be fired in greece even if they do their jobs badly . 
  the worse that can happen is not to get promoted or be transfered somewhere else . 
  and that happens in extreme cases only . 
  so , even he gets caught receiving a bribe , he will not have serious consequences . 
  so he does it without fear . 
  i believe that the same would happen in any other country that has a relaxed law enforcement . 
  if a person from netherlands comes to live here , he will become corrupt , because , why not ? 
  if greek government is placed in charge of netherlands then dutch people will become corrupt . 
  unfortunately having laws is not enough , there has to be competent enforcement because people will not follow them just because it is right . 
  another simple example is from my friends that live in the uk . 
  they are model drivers there , but when they come to greece they always drive above the speed limit and never wear seatbelts . 
  pretty , weird ( for me ) that they do not understand that safety is important and for everyones benefit and it has to be ` enforced ' on them . 
  ( i suppose because in the uk you face more serious penalties and you can be caught as there are cameras and more road checks ) so , to answer your question yes , i believe that a portion of the problem is caused from ordinary people bending the rules because the system does not work to keep them in check . 
  what i mean is that in their help plan , there are clauses that give greater control over greek fiscal policies and minimize the risk/damage to german economy in case of greece defaulting . 
  so , the whole scheme is not a charity , but rather an investement . 
  for example the memorandum binds greek natural resources in case of failing to pay back . 
  so the general general perception is that germans are trying to protect primarily their own interests rather than help greece . 
  one way or another germany benefits from a healthy economy in greece . 
  all i am saying is that there is no ` charity ' involved . 
  i totally disagree with these protests . 
  the germans do not really help as they think and are definitely not ripped-off as they think . 
  but then again , it is not their responsibility to solve this . 
  although they should play a part if they want to portray as the leading nation of europe . 
  the anger and protests should be focused on the greek government that is responsible for creating the economic collapse as finding a solution to end it . 
  if germany did not give us a good solution/deal then it is our responsibility to turn it down/change it . 
  to be honest i would not have a problem of leaving the eu . 
  the state it is in right now is not the best . 
  but since we are in , all of our interests are interdigitated and one leaving will have serious consequences to the others . 
  i think it is obvious that things do not work well as is . 
  my hope is that these problems ( because it is not just greece ) will be answered with good and lasting solutions by integrating europe more . 
  as a greek i believe that the formula we are following is not going to be successful . 
  i do not hate or love germans as i believe that it is not their responsibility to stabilize a country in trouble . 
  ( well , it is but only partly as members of the eu ) the primary discontent goes towards the greek politicians that not only caused this mess but also had no real solution to it and resorted to the bad solution offered ( imposed ? ), 
  by the troika . 
  even then , they could have negotiated the terms better to make this more fair and effective . 
  the big problem is also caused by biased media coverage that portrays the troika as evil dictators that are responsible for our misfortunes . 
  even if we were offered a bad deal , it is the goverment 's responsibility to refuse / provide alternatives or at least negotiate to make things better . 
  personally i would never blame another country for not looking after my country 's best interest . 
  i would never expect them to do that . 
  and just to be clear this whole ` rescue plan ' is not a charity as many people think . 
  if we were useless we would have been kicked out already . 
  i do n't have delusions that another country loves/hates us . 
  my opinion in all these is that a country 's government is responsible for it 's people best interest . 
  to blame other people for that is just wrong . 
  you would be right to do that . 
  similarly , i am wondering why would one like to create a page mocking a religious group .

  not even a little apologism ? 
  i am suprised actually, 
  gr8 b8 m8 . 
  also , gr8 catch m8, 
  mid scroll i was like : what am i doing ?? 
  then i noticed the easter egg !, 
  haaahahaha . 
  anyway : happy euro-cake day !, 
  oh come on every country does that . 
  i am scared to check the opinion of my countrymen . 
  my personal opinion is that the only correct , once and for all solution is to make it better for them to not migrate by investing in african countries . 
  this includes putting * friendly goverments in charge . 
  * i am gon na hate myself later for what i implyed there . 
  fun story : the first time the troyka representatives ever came to greece ( like 2010 or something ) , the hotel where they checked in offered them a discount if they didnt ask for a receipt . 
  and by white you mean anglo-saxon-germanic master race, 
  the `` p '' is silent ^ jkdontkillmedontkillme,

  he should go to eastern europe and tell them that they had it all wrong all that time !,

  what does prometheus has to do with it ?!, 
  well , i guess if there happens a coup , / r/europe please let me know okay ? 
  honestly , nationalistic shit aside , samast doesnt sound greek at all ... 
  and some fuckups 100 years later still glorify war ... ( not intereuropean i mean ), 
  i meant that you were calling people for being racist while generalising several countries thus being racist yourself, 
  you mean we dont already ? 
  yes . 
  despite their best efforts, 
   people from x are racist . 
  you say that you had a few weeks after you smoke . 
  i dont know detail but does it really stay in urine after such a long time ? 
  so you just propose to lower the standards at to what qualifies as `` intoxicated '' .

  he is the most famous lamoyo . 
  the shit he has pulled to profit are incedible ... 
  coulda been better imo, 
  i agree . 
  the americans ( and the europeans too , we are not little innocent flowers ) would love to see heavy turkish public outcry and then intervene to put a favourable guy ( again ) in charge . 
  but they wont do anything unless.the turkish people tear shit up . 
  greek english ein bisschen deutsch and a little bit of everything to the point i interact with lazy tourists that dont bother to learn english ( im looking at you russians italians and elder french ), 
  only the previous one ? 
  who told you that we got rid of it ? 
  the electorate body is mostly really really old, 
  this sounds like something we would have done, 
  dat ben franklin, 
  also , he matches it with the wrong hat . . what a pleb, 
  relevant name, 
  suuuuuuuuuure . 
  it 's all a lie . 
  we live like kings and we just cook the numbers . 
  the unemployment is because we dont have to work anymore with all them euromonies, 
  fuck pitchforking and mob rule , man, 
  greece implemented austerity though . 
  7 full years of it . 
  dont worry you will turn 19 someday . 
  i meant 1 of the 15 countries that emerged from the dissolve . 
  then we struggle for anything ? 
  hunger is reality . 
  why eat when hungry ? 
  do you question reality ??? 
  listen . 
  the mechanism of free market leads to perfect equilibrium . 
  fact . 
  now , this rule has exceptions . 
  fact aswell . 
  on these exceptions , there are solutions for these * market failures * . 
  some of them , involve the state . 
  boom . 
  there 's your necessity for a state . 
  this paragraph is just commonly known facts . 
  if you deny any of the aforementioned , you might aswell deny that the earth is round . 
  two more things : 1 ) this * invisible force * that creates these imperfections , let 's call it reality . 
  now , just because these happen because of reality , it doesnt mean that we should just let it be and be like `` oh well , i guess that 's just how things are '' . 
  we can act on them and we do act on them . 
  2 ) but this `` thing '' is not reality . 
  there is no `` let 's not influence that , and let 's see what 's gon na happen . '', 
  by choosing not to intervene , you are already influencing the outcome by your not-intervention . 
  the `` default '' is not `` look the other way '' . 
  shit this turned out to be long : /, 
  but you can always homeschool them !!, 
  * duh-duh-duuuun * freedom ensured !, 
  i think that this is a little bit of an exaggeration , but even if it is not : why not ? 
  if the remaining 25 % is of quality ? 
  oh for sure , i am never eating ice cream ever again because of this joke . 
  but it is still a joke . 
   but i have seen people stretch `` colonialism '' to all of turkey and telling us to go back to central asia you shouldnt take such people seriously though ... 
  who 's the face that is reflected on it ? 
  okay now i 've made up my mind . 
  you are joking after all . 
  took me 3 comments , but hey , at least i got it . 
  you were gon na run out of ideas soon anyway . 
  thanks for the laugh ,

  your definition of fun is strange,

   the predictions were based on continued access to the single market and article 50 not being invoked ... wat, 
  literally putinbots, 
  tbh part of the turkish part of cyprus being so unable when confronted with ankara is the fact that they are not recognised ( not that 's they should , just saying ), 
  can confirm, 
  i think its purpose is to also showcase this, 
   greece and the country that must not be named will come to an agreement over the naming dispute . 
  i 'll eat my shoe ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ shapedbread,

  museum of oceanography in the meditarrenean ? 
  thanks, 
  why, 
  lol dont worry it 's awesome . 
  and it 's gon na get perfect if you cite one or two sources . 
  ( not that i am doubting you , i actually like this so i would like to see it become even better ), 
  same in greece , only the tobacco brand is different, 
   even tho that 's what pretty much happened , considering oh boy i cant wait to hear the reasoning  how greece lied to everyone yeah we greeks are just smarter than all of you and outsmarted you pretty hard . 
  smart enough to fool everyone , not smart enough to have our shit together . 
  i call it `` schroedinger 's greece ''  huge welfare and shit i am sure you could back this up with numbers if it is true  there is an island where 80 % was supposed to be blind to grab an handicaped check , in some part of the country , people did n't pay electricity , water , the list goes on . 
  in my vilage , grandmas have a word for people who believe these stories , i am not gon na tell you the word i am just gon na tell you to read less propaganda  the idea is for the eu to develop infrastructures and economic project in order to create growth wherever they invest not . 
  the eu might invest , but it 's not its primary thing . 
  also , every country has seen investment from eu , it wasnt investment taken from one country to the other . 
   the problem with greece is that they let money poors in and never checked what really was going on what does that mean exactly ? 
   so the greek never seen an urge to actually develop itself greece is a developed country since at least late 80s  and lived well over what they should how does a person lives over what he should ? 
   german are as much responsible as greek for all this . 
  thats a different thing . 
  the eu doesnt attempt to equalise national incomes . 
  it doesnt have such mechanism . 
  yeah because europe tries to equalise national incomes . 
  oh wait it doesnt, 
   arguing it doesnt without actually arguing thus being shielded from counterarguments, 
  romania and poland . 
  also turkey but they werent that much into ww2, 
  iirc the optimal level of min wage is half the median . 
  median in spain seems to be about 1600 $ [ ^ 1 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_european_countries_by_median_wage ) and the min wage about 750 $ [ ^ 2 ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/tgm/table.do?tab=table&amp;init=1&amp;language=en&amp;pcode=tps00155&amp;plugin=1 ) . 
  so i suppose the slight raise is good in the long term ? 
  all i see is tannu tuva, 
  this just in . 
  tea makes you fat . 
  hmm . . fiscal tools to reduce unemployment always indicate that the ruling party wants to be reelected . 
  i see that in december there are romanian legislative elections . 
  can someone who knows tell me if they are important ? 
  also , shooting for unemployment less than the natural unemployment rate is mostly bad , but governments around the world do that when is election year . 
  that being said it could be seen as a tool to increase the labour flexibility which is a good thing . 
  not even protectionism . 
  outright nationalisation, 
  she is a goddamn time machine, 
  all i see is norway stronk, 
  again evading ... phew, 
  did we ran out of excuses ? 
  jk i know what 's up . 
  because on one hand trump would turbo boost like the dude says and on the other hand it will `` wake '' european equivalents . 
  thats what i call a double edge sword, 
  yeah that 's where a strong comission comes into play, 
  yeah i agree she is the best but it sucks that the german chancellor ( or any of the individual country 's government head ) has to be the `` eu leader '' . 
  it 's akward and it shouldnt be like that, 
  sparta was effective at what ? 
  yeah but then you get stuck with belarus, 
  uns doesnt specify region xd, 
   growth in greece, 
  supported and made by is the difference i am arguing, 
  i doubt it was organised by us . 
  the communists had already been pushed aside for the americans to care . 
  did they collaborate ? 
  sure . 
  but the base of the dictatorship was greek and the elements that made the dictatorship were in greece before the coup and they are today to be seen . 
  in sort there was no reason for the americans to start a dictatorship . 
  i mean , i do n't like complaining , but top9 posts right now at the front page are similar and one has a brain rofl . 
  bbc for news economist for opinion articles, 
  lol including portugal, 
  he said rich , not richer than greece ...

  yes .

  i sometimes use `` church '' and `` temple '' interchangably, 
  4-6 kids before 35 that is .

  meanest thing you ever did to us was mussolini 's attempt to conquer us but who can blame you for this ? 
  mussolini was in charge , there is no need for further explanation . 
  also , we brought our ancient friendship to the new world through our immigrants . 
  our communities always stayed close in the u.s. and canada . 
  we even worked together in that `` mafia '' thing you guys started there * wink * . 
  there is an ancient connection between our people that we should preserve . 
  you are the sexier , richer , more powerful version of greece . 
  we are a little jealous of all this but ultimately , we love your loud-asses . 
  `` holding us back from greatness '' it 's an exaggeration . 
  what i assume they mean is if the uk decided to be a little more pro-eu and actually play a part in the eu politics , they 'd be another germany or france , which benefits everybody . 
  it took a long time for hollande 's france to understand its power in the eu but when they did , it got a little bit better than when germany was the undisputed king of the union . 
  at least as a greek , france seemed like the voice of reason during the july negotiations . 
  hollande was the one pushing the eu for an agreement . 
  apparently , hollande used the respect tsipras has for him and convinced him not to do anything stupid . 
  times were dangerous back then and i think most pro-eu greeks respect hollande for stepping up and helping greece get out of a terrible negotiation . 
  not everyone is the uk , though . 
  they get to have special treatment because they 're a lot more powerful than anyone in this union besides germany and maybe , france . 
  a northerner would certainly feel a bit different than in other european capitals . 
  not necessarily `` bad different '' , just different . 
  we like having tourists here . 
  at least most of us . 
  it shows that people still find our culture and our city interesting , even after all the shit thrown at us the last few years . 
  so feel free to visit us . 
  most people speak english at a basic level , and the majority of the younger generation can hold a conversation comfortably in english . 
  ask for directions , strike up a conversation with them . 
  it will change you 're mind if you 're skeptical about the state of the city . 
  you guys really have no idea what 's going on here . 
  and i do n't blame you . 
  the media really are painting an insanely depressing picture for years . 
  but there is no `` shit hitting the fan '' . 
  what kind of shit ? 
  a communist rebellion ? 
  angry , brown people beating up innocent europeans like spartacus ? 
  come on man . 
  you guys should know better than this . 
  greece is recovering from a financial meltdown , but the sun rises from the east and sets to the west . 
  yeah , social problems like an increasing amount of homeless people and occasional work strikes happen . 
  unemployment is at an all-time high . 
  but that 's what a crisis leaves behind . 
  athens is n't a warzone . 
  it 's a functioning european capital . 
  people go to their 9 to 5s , they take the subway , they buy newspapers from the stands . 
  they live their lives . 
  there are no similarities to cities going through civil war . 
  nothing close to it . 
  edit : grammar . 
  please , suggest a way we could secure our sea border . 
  we 're open to suggestions . 
  you ca n't send them back to turkey because they are n't turkish . 
  they just use turkey as a passage . 
  also , you ca n't send back people when the countries they come from do n't want them back . 
  i know it sounds ridiculous , but it 's the reality . 
  if we could , we would have done that . 
  there is no reason for us to keep those people in our borders . 
  you ca n't deliver refugees back to a war zone . 
  it violates international agreements . 
  it 's also inhuman . 
  we may have failed financially , but we are n't savages . 
  we wo n't mistreat innocent people even if that gets us kicked out of the union . 
  it 's not much of a union lately anyway . 
  you think if we could ship them back , we would n't have tried that already ? 
  and if not us , germany would n't have tried it ? 
  or sweden ? 
  you 're extremely clueless about the whole issue . 
  and if your country is into drowning unarmed people , then the eu made a mistake letting you in . 
  you do n't belong in the civilized world . 
  of course i do n't want my country shooting down boats . 
  it 's a sea border , in case you did n't check the map ... 
  first of all , there is no southern border . 
  check a map before you comment . 
  second , if you guys want to shoot down boats full of people , you are welcome to come here and do it . 
  we are n't savages , we are n't criminals . 
  i hope you understand how hypocritical you sound . 
  it 's an eu problem but god forbid it touches your country . 
  no , fuck the aid . 
  we wo n't turn our country into a `` soul storage '' to make a few countries run by populists happy . 
  you talk about financial aid you ca n't give . 
  you oppose the big boys of the eu by refusing to take migrants but on the other hand , you ask them to aid us after you anal fuck us by closing the northern border . 
  i suggest the visegrad group or whatever returns to stance they had for the last 20 years . 
  do as germany says . 
  you do n't have the power to run things in the eu . 
  i think you 're onto something . 
  shortly after tsipras got elected , isis started forming . 
  thanks tsipras , i guess . 
  germany did n't have a clear proposal . 
  merkel was in favor of greece staying in the eurozone , but schaeuble had even created a plan involving humanitarian help packages sent to greece . 
  he was full on kicking us out . 
  i said germany 's alliance . 
  and no , i do n't believe that germany is evil . 
  i do believe though that germany was the first to spread the `` lazy greek '' stereotype and paint itself as a savior of our corrupted country while in reality , many german companies actively participated in the corruption of greek politicians in the past and germany heavily profited from greece 's overspending . 
  the eu is your biggest trading partner . 
  and you 're a member of the eu . 
  if greece decided not to go with the bailout plan on july 13 , greece would ultimately get kicked out of the union as a whole . 
  that would create a tsunami in european politics and the uk should care , since they are big players in that board . 
  the `` signing '' thing was more of a figure of speech . 
  but yeah . 
  i 'm not sure i agree with the whole `` default '' thing , but at least it 's a proposal . 
  cameron did n't even attend the eurogroup on july 13 , one of the most critical in eu history , the one where tsipras signed the bailout plan . 
  if the prime minister of the united kingdom decides to stay out of this , it shows the position the uk puts itself in modern politics . 
  that 's kind of your fault too .

  the kid was propably bought . 
  i do not know if this is still happening ( i doubt it ) but a more plausible explanation would be that they bought the kid from someone . 
  they searched all through the interpol database and could not find a match for her dna . 
  there are plenty of poor blond-haired people living nearby greece ( bulgaria would be an example . ), 
  yes . 
  a stroll through / r/askhistorians is very recommended . 
  i ca n't say that i agree with you . 
  we greeks are world champions in sticking to the ancient past to fish up personalities , ideals and ideas to be proud of . 
  and from experience i can tell you that this is propably a bad idea . 
  the reasons are that : * romans ( and ancient greeks ) lived a long long long time ago . 
  back then things were different . 
  we tend to identify with the good things that stood the test of time and reflect in today 's world but that is ( as / u/pinegenie pointed out ) nitpicking . 
  did the acient greeks have democracy ? 
  sure ( sort of ) but only if you were a male , non-slave , athenian . 
  and even then only for certain parts of the executive and law-making process of society . 
  * again : romans ( and ancient greeks ) lived a long long long time ago . 
  since then ( and thanks to colonization ) what remained of their influence got spread out to a lot of places ( most notably , the usa ) and stopped being a clear cut european thing . 
  * many of the ideals you mention ( liberty , equality ) do not need anything to stand on . 
  we have evolved our understanding of the human condition to the point where those ideals are self-evident . 
  they do not need a glorious past to be validated ( and it is at least ironic to speak of equality and liberty in a society where slavery was a thing . ), 
  * people that do not identify with those ideas can just as easily twist the popular image we have of the romans to increase the appeal and validate their ideas . 
  since you are german you must be extremely familiar with those scenes : http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-46i-hqo0er8/unnq8ewasji/aaaaaaaauza/9ejbwrykebq/s1600/myphoto.jpeg http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/65/bellamy_salute_1.jpg funnily enough , the neo-nazis in my country are using the `` roman salute '' ( which never existed in the roman times , by the way ) as an `` ancient greek salute to apollo '' ( equally ridiculous ) thereby `` validating '' their actions as actions taken from a time when greece was important . 
  claims of ancestry from people who lived during that time also validate `` good greek blood . '', 
  thus , the reverse can be true as well . 
  people who have never seen a mathematics book in their lives claim they are superior because their ancestors `` invented mathematics . '', 
  clinging to the past can be a dangerous thing . 
  we have the knowledge and opportunity to be greater than the romans ever were . 
  we ( everyday , ordinary europeans ) understand philosophical and ethical ideas and possess powers of reasoning that the average roman would never even dream of . 
  we have technology that would be perceived as magic back then . 
  we are indeed in the position to solve most of the world 's problems and explore space if we would so choose . 
  maybe instead of looking at the past it would be a better idea for you to start looking to the future . 
  hope i did n't tire you with my huge post . 
  finds include ( among others  knifes , automatic rifles and a 1940s anti-aircraft gun . 
  from the article :  the findings have raised questions about whether pallis had contacts within the police force as his home was first raided on june 7 and none of these items was discovered then . 
  a senior police source told kathimerini that officers had only been searching the property for documents at the time . 
  and ...  this week 's searches were conducted after a retired british military officer , edward pringle-stacey , wrote via his lawyer to the supreme court to provide information that he thought may be useful for authorities in their search for weapons that golden dawn could be hiding . 
   pringle-stacey alleged that in 2011 , when he was working with pallis , an ex-associate of shipowner victor restis , he saw a collection of about ** 4,000 firearms ** at premises owned by pallis , who is currently wanted by authorities for the illegal possession of 70 guns . 
  according to the british witness , the weapons included ** ak-47 and m16 assault rifles ** . 
  i am in fact not . 
  i tend to stay away from the whole `` extreme politics '' label . 
  i do not think that the far-right is bad because it is `` extreme '' ( whatever `` extreme '' might mean . ), 
  i think that it is wrong by principle . 
  what is worth noting here is that people that describe the political situation as `` the extremes are rising '' are overlooking the fact that the far-left is not rising . 
  not in france and not in greece . 
  it is the far-right that is on the rise . 
  i think the reason for that is deeply systemic . 
  edit : i understand how a comment like the original might be perceived as `` controversial '' ( at this time is has 9 upvotes and 9 downvotes ) but i think that it is better understood when you do not think about it from a polarised `` extreme = bad '' point of view ( that i reject anyway ) and instead look at things as how they are i.e. 
  the french moving towards the far right because they are ** genuinely ** becoming more conservative , xenophobic etc. 
  kind of took them a while ... 
  i 've been seeing them posted around since last year . 
  the french far-right avoided all the communication and timing mistakes that the greek far-right did n't . 
  we should be afraid of other far-right parties in the eu following their example . 
  this is all very worrisome ... 
  yay !, 
  i do n't think it does . 
  look at our numbers ... 
  yes . 
  yes it is . 
   you can bring up 17n as well , but those are anarchists they are not . 
  they are marxist/communist and therefore very very pro-state . 
  just not the current state . 
   extremism is all the same , wether right or left . 
  the far-right uses violence . 
  the far-left uses violence . 
  therefore the far-right is the far-left . 
  it must be a mistake . 
  i lived for a long time in a city close to volos and no way we got over 200 days per year . 
  there is no place even near greece that gets that much ... 
  12 is volos , greece . 
  really ? 
  hmmm ... 
  while i do agree that at least some part of the gd voter base is composed of people who `` hate '' the traditional political parties of greece , this note must be accompanied by a reference to the deep and strong past of the far-right in greece . 
  it is easy to reduce the voting base of any party in greece to a mass of `` average '' people that vote for sentimental and apolitical reasons ( like you did in your post for syriza . ), 
  i think that if you look at the big picture you will find it at least misleading . 
  the voting base of gd might not care about/understand the specifics of the politics that the party it is voting for is supporting ( just like not all voters of kke are not experts on marxism-leninism ) , but i can not imagine that someone who votes for gd can be positively dispositioned towards gay or immigrant rights ( for example . ), 
  people who voted for gd are in any case ultra-conservative . 
  we might not live in a nation where 7 % ( or even 15 % according to some polls ) of the voters are neo-nazis but we do live in a nation where a percentage similar to that are very very right wing . 
  this can be easily seen by analysing the approval ratings of the 60ies junta . 
  those people did not just die off . 
  they were absorbed by new democracy ( the party that rules greece and that still has some very very right wing people sitting in its benches in parliament ) or laos . 
  they were also silenced by the noise that was created after the junta fell and the abundance of the 90ies . 
  i understand that it is very hard for us to accept that some of our co-citizens have views like that , but they do . 
  it is scary and wrong , yet true . 
  those people were faintly visible with the exploitation of the albanians or the `` macedonia '' and `` devil - id '' rallies of the 90ies but no one gave a fuck back then . 
  i do n't think that what you said is true . 
  i have my believes but if someone disagrees and means well i will welcome it . 
  i would not be vehemently against an action that would render gd illegal . 
  i just want to express my view . 
  this is reddit after all . 
  how is this my argument ? 
   care to elaborate ? 
  i 'm assuming you 're part of some party associated with syriza ? 
  no i am not part of any party . 
  i was part of a local organisation in my home city ( i 've moved since . ), 
  i am part of the general left/far-left movement that is locally active in squats , open assemblies and demonstrations . 
  there are a lot of flavours of `` left '' . 
  i consider anyone fighting for the rights of the working class as a comrade . 
  that might mean ( especially in the us ) to push the state to legislate against multinational companies and in favour of the worker . 
   greece sounds fucked by the way . 
  the weather is nice .

  then what the hell are our ancient myths & epics , super-duper-ultra-hyper-ancient ? 
   how does this work for greeks ? 
  do you feel your country 's history started at independence from the ottomans , or are the greek city states and the byzantine empire just as much part of ` greece 's ' history , with ` greece ' being defined as the current state for the greek nation ? 
  this more or less . 
  when talking about current affairs , we mainly look at our modern history ( what we call `` neo-hellenic history '' ) but we do not consider ancient and byzantine greece to be distinct nations and civilisations , we consider them to be older versions of our own . 
  while most northern & western europeans started having nationalism in the late 1800 's , greeks had had a concept of nationhood since ancient times and we had distinct nationalism since byzantine times ( certainly after the 4th crusade , especially in the empire of nicaea ) . 
  so regardless of whether they called themselves \u1f08\u03c7\u03b1\u03b9\u03bf\u03af , \u0394\u03b1\u03bd\u03b1\u03bf\u03af , \u0393\u03c1\u03b1\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf\u03af , \u1f1d\u03bb\u03bb\u03b7\u03bd\u03b5\u03c2 or \u1fec\u03c9\u03bc\u03b1\u1fd6\u03bf\u03b9 / \u1fec\u03c9\u03bc\u03b9\u03bf\u03af they always considered themselves to be greeks descended from the older greeks . 
  for example , gemistus pletho and several byzantine emperors openly looked down on the latins for being `` barbarians '' as opposed to their own `` refined greek heritage '' ( pletho even wanted to change the name of the empire to the greek empire ) , theodoros kolokotrones and several other greek revolutionaries always told their soldiers that `` as greeks they should bow down to no one , not even gods '' and even in ancient times , homeric and classical greeks wrote epics about their mycenaean ancestors ' glorious feats . 
  i guess it 's because since we always had a very distinct language and ( many times ) religious tradition to our neighbors , it was easy to maintain a separate identity . 
   that 's a bit abstract so let me explain what i mean : being from the netherlands , my country 's history is quite a bit shorter than yours , and the furthest we can go back and still find a recognisably dutch culture is probably the 1400s . 
  however , culturally and in politics it 's possible to find references to the golden age of the 1600s , imperialism and a bit more , however , i think there 's a general feeling that currently relevant history did n't start until ww2 . 
  the dutch always confused me actually . 
  being a history nerd , i learned about their independence from the austrians but i never understood whether they identified as germans before they became independent . 
  still , i always picked you in age of empires iii xd, 
  yes , we 've all seen how great and democratic the eu is in dealing with brexit and the greek crisis . 
  we 've also seen how they 've enforced the migrant quotas on the eastern european states ( woops , they have n't ) . 
  ca n't wait to hand over my nation 's army to that bunch of anti-democratic , incompetent , megalomaniacal , elitist , france-germany dominated bunch of lunatics . 
   then you were at a bad school.the austro hungarian army was useless because it was outdated . 
  they lacked machine guns , they lacked heavy artillery , they lacked sufficient ammunition supplies , their officer corps was unflexible and they had a lack of ncos.the language barrier was a minimal problem and irrelevant in the grand picture . 
  read what the german military advisor to a-h said . 
  `` great hungary wants no refugees but wants all army protection by big eu . 
  the austro-hungarians tried it , had the various national units try to break off and then replaced them with mixed ones and had the absolutely worst army in existence until german military advisors came and split the multi-national units up . 
  then , these national units facilitated the breakup of the empire and nationalisms within it . 
  how about no ? 
   greece has a new currency , that ruined the lives of any greek citizen dumb enough to be fiscally responsible . 
  as a citizen who was fiscally responsible ( like my entire family ) i 'll be happy to inform you that my life has been ruined . 
   the european economy would be in shambles which would further depress the greek economy , no one would lend greece any money unless the conditions were nothing short of draconic and the fundamental problems that run through the greek economy from top to bottom remain unsolved so in a few years , greece is back to square 1 , ready to declare bankruptcy orrrr the germans see through it and go with debt forgiveness , as us intelligence estimated they would do ( without counting on papandreou to be a moron ) . 
   greece spent more than it made before paying any interest . 
  there is litteraly no way to get out of debt in that situation other than austerity , while cracking down on tax evasion in a big way . 
  really now ? 
  austerity helps an economy ? 
  blimey , we should be rocking right now !, 
  and do n't hit me with the `` hitting tax evasion '' crap . 
  how about the eu lenders stop supporting the very people who are greece 's biggest tax evaders ? 
  or how about they stop demanding businesses to pay 100 % of their taxes one year in advance , forcing them to go bankrupt or just tax evade . 
  edit : for those supporting austerity : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s31vlg8qi78, 
  you 're welcome . 
  thanks for being our best neighbour < 3, 
  so how are you grateful then ? 
  the question was very clear . 
  the meanings everyone attached to it were not . 
  'cause then you ca n't blame `` those lazy greeks '' as most german media did and absolve yourself of breaching a promise to voters to not bail out the banking sector again ? 
  you ai n't . 
   first , how one just walk away from the debt ? 
   forceful conversion of debts to drachma is not far from bankruptcy and refusal to pay the debts . 
  indeed , because that 's exactly what the author was proposing . 
   and third , drachma and it 's devaluation will hit the population hard . 
  people would switch to $ in their businesses , look at eastern europe in 1990s . 
  indeed , it would hit the people very hard . 
  almost as hard as austerity , but not for as long . 
  besides , it would also hit the rest of europe , so it 'd probably end with forgiveness ( which is what the us diplomatic cables show the us expected to almost certainly happen ) unless germany & co wanted to see the eu economy turn to shit . 
  but when you have morons/traitors like papandreou in charge , you ca n't even expect that basic level of diplomatic foresight . 
  masters of photoshop ... 
  i 'm fairly certain we do n't own the last two anymore ( for now ) . 
  well , because we have pooled all our resources in the mountainous area of athens , we have neglected to develop the fertile , river-full plains of northern and western greece , which could easily be industrialised . 
  basing all out economy of the services and smal lindustry sector of athens is a recipe for disaster . 
  people from the provinces often call greece the `` state of athens '' . 
  tbh ( even though i 'm athenian ) it 's true and it 's a pretty big reason of why our economy is so crappy . 
  we are of shitstate . 
   maybe its time to start viewing europe as having naturally different zones with different economic activity and that having that activity centered in one part is only natural . 
  how about no ? 
   so when you 're meeting a pontic speaker , you 'd be hearing the greek very similar ( or rather , even more similar , if i understood you correctly ) to what the byzantines would 've been speaking ? 
  more or less  though , keep in mind , late byzantine dialects are very similar to modern greek . 
  pontic was isolated , so it resembles what `` true '' byzantine greek was like before the 4th crusade and turkish invasions which led to a breakdown of byzantine public education ( that had standardised koine greek ) . 
   and to be able to read the sources directly !, 
  i 'm jealous haha , you have a very rich and ancient language !, 
  thank you !, 
  at least we have that going for us xd, 
  `` integrated '', 
   i should translate '' \u1f25\u03c4\u03b9\u03c2 '' though . 
  it must come from \u03b5\u1f30\u03bc\u03af , but for the life of me i ca n't figure out the conjugation it 's in . 
  not really , they are n't related though it looks similar with various tenses of \u03b5\u1f30\u03bc\u03af . 
  \u1f25\u03c4\u03b9\u03c2 is the female version of `` the one who/which ''  outof curiousity , are all greeks able to do what you just did - take modern greek , make some adjustments and turn it into ancient greek ? 
  and how well is the average greek able to read ancient and koine greek ? 
  most greeks who 've finished high school can do that . 
  ancient is kinda harder for us to read , but we can manage it . 
  greek is much closer to its linguistic ancestors than , say , italian is to latin ( thanks byzantium & orthodox church ) so we can get the gist of it . 
  the biggest change is in grammar simplification and accent . 
  koine is quite easy , as modern greek is basically simplified koine with loanwords . 
  some dialects ( like tsakonian , pontic , old athenian & maniot etc. ), 
  are much more archaic , so for them it 's much easier . 
  pontic , for example , is basically koine so to them classical is what koine is to the standard modern greek speakers . 
   well that 's interesting.to be honest in greece we never had any problems with the large turkish population who lives at the north part of the country , thrace ( they are not exactly `` immigrants '' , just people who decided to stay in greece after the greece-turkey population exchange ) . they have adapted pretty good throughout all those years . 
  lol nope they have n't . 
  there was an investigation about their mps giving classified data to the turkish consulate and the turkish consulate always organises visits for erdogan 's son there . 
  as if that was n't enough , they have multiple pro-union with tukrey ovements and they burned down community housing that we had built for them to help them integrate . 
  and that 's without counting how hostile they are to greeks . 
  i had a friend whose family lived there because he 's father 's a military officer and they treated them like an occupation force . 
  greece op plz nerf . 
  well more like : \u0112 kop\u00e9la pou p\u1e17re to teleuta\u00edo chrys\u00f3 \u00e9spase to rek\u00f3r gia t\u0113n kategor\u00eda t\u0113s . 
  close enough though . 
  after all , the greek i used was rather slangy . 
  maybe an ancient greek version would help ? 
  i spread it out a bit more and made it more archaic/official , so it should be closer to what you 've studied . 
  the girl who got the last gold broke the world record for her category . 
  tmw your country put no money into its olympic teams and you still manage to get 3 medals ( including a world record ) . 
   you greeks deserve to live in eternal misery 'cause you stink and you do n't give receipts for coffee . 
  / r/europe at the time, 
  surprise enosis !, 
  eu bots at their usual stupid level .

  we 've seen all too often western imperialists supporting military coups against the threat of communism , that 's what happened with the junta of the colonels in greece in 1960s . 
  so shut up . 
  i will never support a military coup against the mere threat of future dictatorship . 
  there has n't actually yet been a successful communist revolution except in the countries that first had an anti-communist tyranny -- and there has n't ever yet been an islamic state that was n't formed on some former secular dictatorship . 
  why ? 
  because they get their justifications for their communist/islamist tyranny , from the tyranny that * preceded * them . 
  turkish democracy won against a bunch of dictators . 
  if erdogan becomes a actual dictator himself , then it 'll be a new fight against him , but no threat of his future dictatorship justifies his opponents to make a dictatorship themselves before he * actually * launches his own . 
  secularists must learn to ally themselves with democrats , rather than cheer on military dictators . 
  the secularists should support erdogan as the rightfully elected president , even as they oppose his policies . 
  the people of turkey correctly supported their democratically elected leader . 
  erdogan is n't an open dictator yet , though we rightly fear he 's heading that way . 
  protesting and demonstrating against him is fine , overthrowing him by coup is not . 
  one does not protect democracy with coups . 
  no they denounced it from the start and they were correct to do so , according to democratic principles . 
  or perhaps i 'm a democrat and it was democratically elected . 
   there are a lot more people out there who agree with him for syria and stuff and some of his views and speeches - and they are far from being `` neo-nazis '' nobody said that everyone who loves putin is a neonazi . 
  what i said is that all the neonazis love putin . 
  can you explain this , if it 's not that he 's like hitler in all the ways that matter ? 
   there are a lot more people out there who agree with him for syria and stuff and some of his views and speeches - and they are far from being `` neo-nazis '' even hitler probably believed that the sky was blue . 
  that putin is second hitler does n't necessitate that he 's wrong on everything , or that you need believe him wrong on everything . 
   and yet all i see in media is `` russia is second hitler and they eat little babys '' and shit like this it is second hitler , that 's exactly the reason that all the neonazis in europe love putin . 
  to annex crimea , russia used the exact same excuses that hitler used to annex sudetenland . 
  the eu is n't a hive mind with a single will . 
  switzerland with its direct democracy seems to be doing okay , no worse than many other countries and better than most . 
  you prefer people being hurt or rewarded by choices that others ( e.g. 
  a king or a dictator ) makes for them ? 
  democracy is n't about how the people can make the best choice , democracy is about having the people be hurt or rewarded by the choices that they themselves make . 
  democracy is likewise not about the public not being deceived , but about the politicians * needing * to deceive the public . 
  ( rather than just needing to arrest or execute or exile dissidents , which is the case in non-democracies ) referenda are a good idea . 
  it 's good that the british people were given the choice , even if their decision was wrong . 
  most decisions will be wrong . 
  they will suffer from their decision , and their next decision will be better . 
  what do you think him to be in denial about ? 
  did you switch because of cox 's murder ? 
  if not , you know atleast one person that did n't . 
  yes , we get it , it 's not that you actually wanted to leave , you are simply evil bastards that want to hurt other countries for the sheer lolz of it . 
  so you are doing everything you can to maximize the harm , even if that means not leaving . 
  diabolical . 
  satan applauds and so does putin . 
  your evilness is also exemplified by you being angry at a treaty that gave a voluntary exit procedure , unlike all the other previous treaties which were binding you in perpetuity . 
  nobody would have forced you to remain back then either of course but you 'd have been dishonorable treaty-breakers if you left before the treaty of lisbon . 
  distinguishing between the deliberate liars/propagandists , and the people who innocently made a mistake , and shaming the former is of big value . 
  we now know that sebow is a deliberate liar/propagandist . 
  since you 're still not taking back the lie , but rather doubling down on it , no , you 're a filthy fucking liar , and i 'll keep repeating that and exposing your lies . 
  because the constituent countries had n't joined voluntarily , and they were n't being allowed to leave voluntarily , unlike the case with the eu , which does both . 
  yes it is . 
   norway and switzerland do n't have to join the eu because it would be to their disadvantage . 
  so you 're saying the eu is n't forcing countries to join , that the countries themselves decide to join , if they decide it 's to their own advantage . 
  do n't you understand that this is completely different to what you were accusing the eu before , that supposedly if you `` you reject joining the eu , you get another fucking referendum , till you join . '', 
  or are you mentally retarded , besides just a liar ? 
  you 've still not taken back the absurd lie you spoke about countries never having referenda to join , when in fact the majority of countries in the eu have had such referenda . 
  first of all , no these are different opinion polls . 
  secondly , what are * your * evidence for your claims about how people thought , if we 're not allowed to use either opinions polls that said what ` no ' people thought , nor the arguments of the leaders of the no side ? 
  it seems all you have as evidence is `` 61 % of the people are not idiots . 
  '' , but you do n't explain how big of a percentage you believe the idiots to actually be , and how you 've come to your number . 
   and what happens when you reject joinin the eu ? 
  then you do n't join , as happened with norway and switzerland . 
   you get another fucking referendum , till you join . 
  the ireland example . 
  the ` repeated ' irish referendum was n't about joining . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/referendums_related_to_the_european_union - ireland held a referendum in 1972 for joining , 83.1 % in favour it passed . 
  - ireland held again a referendum for the single european act in 1987 , passed 69.9 % in favour . 
  - ireland held again a referendum for the treaty of maastricht in 1992 , passed 68.7 % in favour . 
  - ireland held again a referendum for the treaty of amsterdaam in 1998 , passed 61.74 % in favour . 
  - ireland held two referendums on treaty of nice 53.9 % against ( 2001 ) 62.9 % in favor ( 2002 ) - ireland held two referendums on treaty of lisbon 53.2 % against ( 12 june 2008 ) 67.1 % in favor ( 2 october 2009 ) if you are angry that ireland repeated the last two referenda ( after it got some additional opt-outs and privileges ) then i should remind you that it 's the treaty of lisbon that gives the uk ( and every country ) its ability to * exit * freely . 
  before the treaty of lisbon you did n't actually have that right , the eu treaties were binding in perpetuity . 
  the treaty of lisbon was thus a great victory for the right to exit as well . 
  think again before you blast the eeevil eu for making a treaty that * gives * every country the right to leave it , which they previously did n't actually have legally . 
  if we had been stuck with the treaty of amsterdam , uk would n't even have been * able * to leave , legally speaking . 
   where is the last time you saw a referendum of a country about joining the eu ? 
  that 's right , never . 
  what the fucking fuck , you bloody ignoramus . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/referendums_related_to_the_european_union the majority of countries in the eu have had a referendum about joining it : ireland , denmark , austria , sweden , finland , malta , slovenia , hungary , lithuania , slovakia , poland , czech republic , estonia , latvia , croatia all had referendums about joining the eu or its predecessors . 
  if we also include the countries that held favourable referenda on some subsequent treaty like maastricht ( italy , france ) or the eu constitution ( spain , netherlands , luxembourg ) the majority gets even higher . 
  so take back the lie you spoke , immediately , or you 'll not be a just liar out of ignorance , but a deliberate liar . 
  take it back , immediately , no excuses . 
  * your * country never held a referendum for it , and * my * country likewise did n't . 
  but * your * country 's failures at democracy and mine 's are n't a reason to blame the eu for it . 
   and if you say something about it , you 're labeled as racist , xenophobe and anti-european since it 's a complete lie , as i just proved you , you should be labelled a `` liar '' unless you take back the lie immediately and never repeat it . 
   almost all countries . 
  in most countries there 's no obligation for the ministers to come from the parliament . 
  not even the uk has that as a legal necessity , only as a custom . 
  and in lots of countries if you are appointed minister you need give up your seat in the parliament . 
  that 's the case in the usa , in france , in luxembourg , in belgium ... other places too . 
   ministers are elected to the parliment and then picked from those elected to be ministers . 
  `` picked from those elected '' means they are picked , not elected . 
  i gave you the opinion polls indicating that , i showed you the graphs . 
  i know what grexit means , that it meant leaving the euro , not the eu . 
  look i 'm being very very clear . 
  the majority of yes voters were voting against grexit , but only a tiny minority of the no voters believed they were voting for grexit . 
  yes , of course the no vote should have meant bringing the drachma back or better terms . 
  but not because no voters chose to bring the drachma back , merely because bringing the drachma back was the natural consequence of that vote , if their wishes about the terms of the agreement were respected , and tsipras successfully fooled them into thinking grexit was n't the only other path left . 
  i oppose this violation of democracy , and since the no was successful i would have wished us to grexit , in accordance with the choice of the majority . 
  but that does n't mean that the greek people were n't woefully misinformed about what they were choosing . 
  democracy is n't about only non-idiots voting . 
   the no vote , like it or not , was about a grexit . 
  that 's definitely what the yes side was saying  61 % of the people are not idiots . 
  why do you think so ? 
  https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2015/07/09/what-were-the-greeks-thinking-heres-a-poll-taken-just-before-the-referendum/ `` an overwhelming majority of those who voted no -- about 88 percent -- believed that , as a result of an oxi vote , negotiations would continue , as you can see below .

  depends where you live . 
  i 'm in a fairly upper class suburb of athens and half the boys we meet are iasonas , achilleas , mathaios etc and the girls are nephele , danae or evelina . 
  even when going for original names greeks name their kids the same things . 
  amon amarth !!!, 
  it 's from byzantine greek from what i 've been told . 
  the word is supposed to have been \u0392\u03c5\u03b6\u03ac\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd but the spelling changed with the years . 
  the village where my grandfather is from in crete actually translates to little tit ( vizari ), 
  pic is taken at an angle . 
  facing straight up they would n't look that dickish . 
  i 've never had portuguese food . 
  what is it like ? 
  goddamit now im hungry . 
  i get what you mean . 
  i found a lot of cheaper clothes in the uk than i would have found them in greece . 
  i went all the way to oxford at bicester village designer outlet but it was worth it . 
  if you do decide on athens after all besides ermou i would suggest for you to go to mcarthur glenn athens outlet or to factory outlet which is on the way to the airport ( you can find buses to both ) . 
  you might also find some good deals at the mall athens which is closer to the city and accessible by metro, 
  oh , you bastards , stealing tourists from athens !, 
  shame on you !, 
  shame !, 
  fine , u/pagamel , ermou is kinda shit but there 's no acropolis in thessaloniki and their sea smells . 
  greece cheaper than romania ?!, 
  are branded items ridiculously expensive in romania , or something ? 
  this sounds really off to me . 
  om nom nom nom, 
  because you 're broke , right ? 
  my nicest uber driver in my entire stay in london was polish . 
  he was awesome . 
  that 's john munch , you heathen . 
  yeah , i 'm not saying stop asking for the right to marriage . 
  i 'm saying at least finally there is some legal protection . 
  for what it 's worth , civil partnership ( \u03a3\u03cd\u03bc\u03c6\u03c9\u03bd\u03bf \u03a3\u03c5\u03bc\u03b2\u03af\u03c9\u03c3\u03b7\u03c2 ) has the same legal standing as a marriage now and it 's finally available to gay couples in greece . 
  the bubbles !, 
  they are adorable !, 
  lamiapolice said : we should start sending songs in greek . 
  i answered : it will be like spring coming !, 
  ( reference to greece 's eurovision entry in 1991 ) no kidding , greek songs with a chorus in english like `` alcohol is free '' would also be great, 
   talvisota oooh , i 'd forgotten this one . 
  very energetic song , i like it . 
  i was joking about final solution . 
  i just like that song so much better than ghost division . 
  i flove the whole album coat of arms , it was my introduction to them so i 'm a bit biased . 
  hehe , i think i 'd give it to australia , no offense but were n't you kinda the bad guys ? 
  i do n't know who gets primo victoria ... what an awesome song . 
  uk , i guess ? 
  sneaky finns , they had been preparing for this their whole lives . 
  loved how in the end one of our ministers , something like that had been there to congratulate the winners but he did n't want to photographed with the monsters ( he had some insane notion that our lady would get it for her shitty ballad , i do n't know ) so he had to get out of there quick, 
  sabaton could just do a eurovision all by themselves . 
  just choose one of their songs for each country . 
  greece - coat of arms poland - uprising ( of course , what a cool song !, 
  warsaw , city at war ! ), 
  finland - white death russia - panzerkampf germany - the final solution ... oh wait ... probably would n't be too thrilled about that :p, 
  they were the favourites that year . 
  i was n't sure but i was actually there for the semi final ( the final tickets were crazy expensive ) and after seeing their performance i had no doubts . 
  the crowd went wild . 
  and they got a lot of `` protest '' televoting from people who were tired of the same old same old . 
  and what i also admire was their dedication . 
  we had hellishly high temperatures in athens those days and the guys were going around in full monster get up even out of the performances . 
  they must have been melting inside . 
  what are you doing in r/europe if you do n't get this joke ? 
  do it for your lava, 
  must have sucked for poor jamala . 
  her song was nice . 
  to be fair , i am happy for portugal for their first win after so many years . 
  and portuguese is such a beautiful language to sing in . 
  did n't like his speech , very condescending, 
  it 's been going on for 40 years , you just noticed ? 
  i do n't hate the portuguese song but i 'm afraid if it wins the next years all the songs will be along the same lines and we 'll die of boredom . 
  well deserved boos for those 12 points to cyprus, 
  they say it in french here too . 
  oh no , israel is leaving ? 
  omfg he mooned us, 
  that little georgian girl was cute as a bug . 
  yeah , sabaton singing about wwii , totally nothing wrong with that picture they should do the entries for all countries . 
  i claim coat of arms ( duh ! ), 
  belgium is a song that can survive eurovision for me . 
  like it a lot . 
  sup with her hair , though ? 
  does n't she own a brush, 
  no worries , you only have 60 years of contests to catch up on . 
  i want to cry this was so bad . 
  the cypriot choreography was kinda shitty, 
  i do n't hate the uk 's song . 
  definitely hope they are not last place again, 
  why are you only just watching it now ? 
  how on earth were you allowed to move to sweden without knowing anyhting about eurovision , you heathen . 
  spain sent cousin lancel lannister pre sparrows, 
  is it me or did he pronounce her name `` dummy '' ? 
  omg i wan na have graham norton 's gay , snarky babies, 
  the fat guy is singing a duet with himself ? 
  omg , the guy who was shrinking vegetables !!, 
  jeez i like the portuguese guy but he looks like he votes for syriza, 
  omg , that yodeling shit made it past the semis ??? 
  noooooo, 
  jesus , italy ca n't get with the times , can they ? 
  when was this thing written ? 
  wrong gypsy . 
  you need aziz for that . 
  gypsy khal and epic violin lady ? 
  drink .

  for example during the ' 67 - '74 military dictatorship , the king took a wishy-washy position where he was n't strongly pro- or anti-junta . 
  which is why he ended up getting deposed . 
  twice , actually . 
  the junta called a referendum to abolish the monarchy in '73 because they no longer trusted him ( they had started out as officially royalists , to gain the support of conservative monarchists , sorta like franco did ) . 
  he lost that vote , in what * seem * to have been fair elections , despite being held under the dictatorship . 
  but after the dictatorship was overthrown , all its acts were declared null , so technically that should involve reinstating the king . 
  to see if that should happen , the new democratic government called another referendum in ' 74 , which the king * also * lost . 
  so he managed to get abolished twice , once under the junta and once under the democratic restoration , which shows how good a job he did trying to play both sides . 
  yeah , the former greek king 's house name ( gl\u00fccksburg ) is n't even easy to write in greek , since both hard ` g ' and ` b ' appear mostly in loanwords and do n't have letters in the alphabet to represent them . 
  and \u00fc does n't exist at all . 
  so the name gets transliterated to \u0393\u03ba\u03bb\u03cd\u03be\u03bc\u03c0\u03bf\u03c5\u03c1\u03b3\u03ba , which is something like gklyxmpourgk . 
  in greek we use `` russian salad '' for that for some reason . 
  thessaloniki [ has some like those ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/thessaloniki_urban_transport_organization#mediaviewer/file:citaro_o530g.jpg ) too . 
  they do n't need to turn much because they run on the fairly straight major boulevards that cross the city lengthwise ( the red roads parallel to the waterfront [ on this map ] ( http://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=14/40.6297/22.9449 ) ) . 
  i get along pretty well with the turks i 've met . 
  have quite a bit in common . 
  however it 's probably a bit of a self-selecting group , because i 've met turks mostly through universities abroad . 
  when we 're both in an english-speaking setting in a third country , chances are that we are more internationally oriented and secular than many of our countrymen are . 
  atat\u00fcrk is a complex subject . 
  first line is , `` i recognize you by the fearsome sharpness of your sword '' . 
  and it has 158 stanzas , takes [ about an hour to sing ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aydiztnjrny ) . 
  what 's not to like ? 
  ( although technically only the first two stanzas of [ the poem ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hymn_to_liberty ) are considered the official anthem nowadays . 
  and i do like most of the poem , very much in the classic up-with-liberty/down-with-tyrants style of the turn of the 19th century , quite influenced by the style of french revolutionary poetry too . ), 
  they have a lot of more recent things as well . 
  turkey and russia supported opposite sides in the armenian-azerbaijan war of the 1990s , which produced a long falling out ( russia supported armenia , turkey supported azerbaijan ) . 
  partly as a result , russia officially recognized the armenian genocide , which antagonized turkey further . 
  yeah , it 's from july 9 , with surveys done probably in early july , maybe late june . 
  also there were some other questions ; this graph is a reformatting of the answers to only one of the questions [ from the full report ] ( http://www.pewglobal.org/2014/07/09/russias-global-image-negative-amid-crisis-in-ukraine/ ) . 
  it 's worth reading the rest of it to get a bigger picture . 
  i do n't know why this graph only mentions `` pew research center '' but does n't include an actual link ( i only found it because it was on / r/europe a few days ago ) . 
  yeah there are some strong historical connections revolving around asia minor . 
  i 'm pretty ambivalent on russia myself , but my grandfather was very positive about them for personal reasons , because a local russian official in pontus gave his family a russian passport in 1916 as [ events ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/greek_genocide ) were getting nasty , which helped them make a safe escape ( turkish authorities typically would n't harm people who had passports of a great-power nation ) . 
  many greek and armenian refugees ended up coming out of the turmoil of the 1910s/20s seeing russia as the protector of asia minor christians . 
  and the orthodox christian connection helps as well , since people ( especially more religious or traditional ones ) feel a cultural connection even to current-day russians . 
  in recent years i think many greeks like putin just because he angers the americans , and a lot of greeks enjoy seeing the usa get poked in the eye . 
  but i do n't think there is much desire to expend any real political energy supporting him as he does crazier things . 
  that 's for views on russia , which are a bit more positive than views on putin . 
  the [ full report with both is here ] ( http://www.pewglobal.org/2014/07/09/russias-global-image-negative-amid-crisis-in-ukraine/ ) . 
  greece is less anti-putin than most european countries , but still net negative on him : 57 % of greeks have `` no confidence '' in putin doing the right thing for world affairs , 41 % have `` confidence '' ... at least as of 2 weeks ago . 
  the ottomans also aligned some of their interests with those of some fairly powerful greeks ; it was n't all via unwilling oppression ( despite what mythologized greek nationalist history says ) . 
  in the case of the patriarch , the ottoman interests and the interests of some orthodox clerics aligned in being anti-west : the ottomans were worried about another crusade being launched in the west to `` rescue '' the eastern christians , and were also worried about how to govern the greeks in a way that would n't result in constant rebellions . 
  hardline orthodox clerics had long been worried about pro-western trends in orthodoxy that they feared would end up with orthodoxy being subservient to the pope , and also wanted a larger role for the church in governing civil life . 
  so after taking constantinople , the sultan came up with an arrangement : find [ the most anti-western cleric ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gennadius_scholarius ) of the prominent ones , appoint him as patriarch , and delegate to the church responsibility for governing some aspects of the greek communities ( especially social and family life ) . 
  this , it was hoped , would both keep greeks from looking westward , and would also simplify civil administration , since the church 's authority was seen as likely to be followed , more than direct ottoman authority would have been . 
  the powerful role of the [ phanariotes ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/phanariotes ) , greek merchants and politicians based in constantinople who had a number of important roles in the empire , was another aspect of the delicate ottoman/greek accommodation . 
  [ ok , comment went longer than i thought , and is probably pretty off topic at this point . ], 
  you forgot sauerkraut !, 
  same here , but when we think of cia and coups , it is n't latin american ones that come to mind first ... 
  well they had to keep the accusations believable !, 
  nobody would believe that right sector are on board with * modern * european values ... 
  looks like no big change in sentiments in greece ( about 2/3 positive , 1/3 negative , same as before ) . 
  possible factors : anti-american sentiment , the orthodox-christian connection , and the increasing numbers of russian tourists . 
  from what i can tell they have a better relationship with nato than might be expected , because they 've shared information about islamic militants in the region with western intelligence agencies , which results in the eritrean government being treated leniently . 
  the eu is trying to half-deal with it , though . 
  the eu requires immigrants to be processed at their first eu country of entry , as if it 's a union . 
  without the eu , there would be no such requirement : if an immigrant entered italy and then went to austria , well they 'd not be italy 's problem anymore . 
  but under the eu rules they should be processed in italy as the entry point . 
  this makes some sense , if you treat the eu 's external borders as a quasi-national border , and the first entry point as something like entry into a new jurisdiction . 
  but then you have to actually treat it as such . 
  the eu does n't want to * really * treat the eu borders as the important borders in need of a common patrol and processing system . 
  but it does want the `` front-line '' countries to deal with it * as if * it were a front-line border , not only their own national borders . 
  this is a bit trying to have it both ways . 
  yes , i think the main concern other countries would have is the precedent if it 's a non-negotiated independence ( if it 's a referendum * with * spanish approval , that 's different ) . 
  countries who do n't actually care about catalonia do n't want russia to be able to use it as justification for south ossetia and similar , and china is very worried about such cases as well ( which is why they do n't recognize kosovo , not because they actually care about serbia ) . 
   also polish neo nazi in england ... 
  logical . 
  reminds me of the diaspora branches of golden dawn in north america and australia ... raising money from immigrant communities in other countries , to send back home to support an anti-immigrant party in the motherland . 
  unfortunately , you could have reprinted a very minor edit of this article , in just about every decade since the 1880s or so . 
  here 's a passage from wikipedia :  greece remained a very poor country throughout the 19th century . 
  the country lacked raw materials , infrastructure and capital . 
  agriculture was mostly at the subsistence level , and the only important export commodities were currants , raisins and tobacco . 
  some greeks grew rich as merchants and shipowners , and piraeus became a major port , but little of this wealth found its way to the greek peasantry . 
  greece remained hopelessly in debt to london finance houses . 
   by the 1890s greece was virtually bankrupt , and public insolvency was declared in 1893 . 
  poverty was rife in the rural areas and the islands , and was eased only by large-scale emigration to the united states . 
  there was little education in the rural areas . 
  nevertheless there was progress in building communications and infrastructure , and fine public buildings were erected in athens . 
  despite the bad financial situation , athens staged the revival of the olympic games in 1896 , which proved a great success . 
  the country has long had a problem of being a mostly poor country , with a wealthy merchant class whose wealth does n't really trickle down , and the wealthy class having quite a lot of connections with the political class . 
  disgust at the 100-years-ago version of that situation is one of several factors that converged to promote [ venizelos 's ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eleftherios_venizelos ) rise , where in 1909 -- 10 his populist appeal almost completely ejected the old oligarchs ' parties from parliament . 
  but that was obviously not the end of that story . 
  finally all these billions of dollars spent on f16s will pay off !, 
  the source of ` el ' is even more obvious if you look at the greek spelling of * hellenic republic * , \u0395\u03bb\u03bb\u03b7\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae \u0394\u03b7\u03bc\u03bf\u03ba\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03af\u03b1 , i.e. 
  trivia : why is the adjective spelled ` hellenic ' instead of ` ellenic ' in english ? 
  prepending an ` h ' is how latin represented the ancient greek [ rough breathing ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rough_breathing ) mark on vowels . 
  therefore ancient greek \u1f19\u03bb\u03bb\u03ac\u03c2 becomes latin * hellas * . 
  that probably really was once pronounced as something like an ` h ' before the vowel , but it stopped being pronounced about 2200 years ago , leaving * ellas * as the pronunciation . 
  nonetheless the rough-breathing mark , and its latin rendering as ` h ' , was retained in both greek and latin spelling until recently . 
  in greek it became just a silent vestigial mark , while in latin borrowings it was pronounced . 
  the greek spelling reform of 1982 finally removed those vestigial marks from greek orthography . 
  i do n't live in the u.s. anymore , but when i lived in houston , the poor people near me lived in housing that looked more [ like this ] ( https://www.google.com/maps/place/alvin,+tx/@29.416176,-95.239867,3a,75y,178.16h,79.52t/data=!3m4!1e1!3m2!1sl1dy3j8tjkpjzeyuppogha!2e0!4m2!3m1!1s0x86405ef64ba505df:0x5994eb37447891c9 ) or [ this ] ( https://www.google.com/maps/@29.784314,-95.177185,3a,75y,199.19h,87.93t/data=!3m4!1e1!3m2!1svgllqlwooupkoohzryv6uq!2e0?hl=en ) or [ this ] ( https://www.google.com/maps/@29.779939,-95.341008,3a,75y,180.33h,79.15t/data=!3m4!1e1!3m2!1sjurynin4-fcw7kj4pddkqg!2e0?hl=en ) . 
  driving through those areas honestly did n't feel too first-world , even though the first of the three is actually considered more lower-middle-class housing , not ghetto ( the last two are pretty ghetto ) . 
  and if anything those are the `` nice '' kinds of poor-people housing , because they 're probably somewhat more hygienic than the ghetto apartment complexes . 
  not even just the projects , but also a good amount of the rental housing in areas considered ghettoes : most poor people do n't live in government-provided housing , but in rental housing in poor neighborhoods . 
  detroit gives a kind of worst-case example , but there are big parts of los angeles , houston , st. louis , chicago , cleveland , atlanta , birmingham , etc. , etc. 
  with tons of falling apart , vermin-infested apartments and houses , too . 
  there are also large trailer parks in many smaller towns and suburban areas with pretty poor-quality housing . 
  the * worst * housing i 've seen in the u.s. was actually in a non-city area , though , the mississippi delta region . 
  looks like shacks right out of the 1930s .

  you are not the sjw police . 
  attack the arguement 's merits , not the person . 
  in my opinion , he did n't say anything wrong here . 
  if you think he did , say so , do n't try an extremely petty ad hominem . 
  and they say the remove kebab mey mey has grown irrelevant !, 
  using hunic tribes ?!, 
  what preposterous idea this is . 
  what are they going to do , throw poo at our invaders ? 
  athena blesses us and the hellenic states shall be forever , i tell you . 
  not exactly . 
  while the word itself makes `` fun '' of the other languages ( bar bar basically ) , a barbarian was anyone who was not ethnically greek . 
  language was kind irrelevant in that regard . 
  modern `` art '' is shit . 
  although one thing to note is that every single one of those contains the colour black . 
  interesting observation of the finnish psyche if nothing else . 
  eh , not really . 
  that would have been the case if the courts did n't interfere and forbid the independence referendum . 
  as of now , they are n't really free to stay in or leave . 
  she is turkish ... and erm , white . 
  she is a white minority . 
  gyros is serious business . 
  mayo is disgusting . 
  filthy mayo traitors should be executed in our glorious ketchup revolution . 
  yeah , my knowledge of finnish language and customs is limited to [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wljpl6petn8 ) pretty much . 
  coke zero master race . 
  the language is very easy actually . 
  just type random consonants with the occasional u with an umlaut . 
  then , every 3 words , add a perkele . 
  done , perfect finnish !, 
  well ... free trade and self-determination are pretty damn liberal concepts . 
  i am calling them liberal in the classical sense of the word as defined by personal freedom , to be clear . 
  the american definition is indeed different but this is / r/europe , in the end of the day . 
  i would n't call either of those positions non-liberal . 
  i mean , i do n't disagree with either of those but they are pretty damn liberal positions . 
  you give a shit about karma ? 
  i have to say , that is surprising to me . 
  also , no , i did n't downvote you and i am genuinely unable to give a fuck about downvotes as long as it does n't interfere with discussion and visibility . 
  i have to admit it 's kind of weird you give a shit about that . 
  i can accuse you of many things but you generally do n't karmawhore . 
  i am not saying `` see a professional '' as an insult . 
  i genuinely believe it would benefit you . 
  if it makes you feel better about it , i openly admit i see one myself . 
  it is a good thing and we all have issues to work through . 
  i just think yours are particularly large . 
  there you go , that 's my advice . 
  take it or leave it . 
  i need to sleep now , if i may be excused . 
  work tomorrow . 
  i do n't even think you are a terrible person . 
  you literally have the saddest worldview i have ever seen , completely unrelated to your political opinions . 
  i did n't misinterpret your post . 
  your post is : a ) you have an agenda . 
  b ) you share this agenda with some sort of comrades . 
  c ) be happy because your agenda won . 
  unless i am reading your comment extremely wrong , that is what you wrote . 
  my answer to that is that i do n't have an agenda that i feel i need to push and your worldview is twisted and toxic . 
  so yes , please do stay the fuck away from me . 
  i would honestly suggest talking to a professional because your attitude is not one of a healthy adult ( if you indeed are an adult ) . 
  i am not your psychologist nor do i wish to be . 
  yeah , you are absolutely right on that . 
  i was just trying to give a very simple ... er , quip ? 
  to start the conversation . 
  evolution was a pet subject of mine for quite a few years ( when i was also passing my edgy atheist phase ) so i know quite a few more than i normally should about it . 
  it is a bloody fascinating subject . 
   your comrades are quite open about the effort they put into this propaganda . 
  they 've told me stories about how they were ignored and downvoted at first but with their valiant effort to keep it up no matter the difficulties they persevered . 
  an `` evil cabal '' they are not but the opinions here did not change organically either . 
  there was concentrated effort to achieve this and i do n't see the reason you 're pretending that 's a conspiracy theory . 
  you 're selling your comrades short . 
  i will regret this . 
  i always do with you , but i am drunk enough , so here we go : i know you might find that hard to believe , but people are not born with their political opinions . 
  debate , discussion and friendly conversation can and do change people 's minds . 
  i also do n't have as a goal to change anyone opinions , per se . 
  i know this is also hard to understand but i am not , in fact , here to propagandise any evil right wing ideology . 
  i am here to share ideas with people . 
  in fact , many of my ideas have changed based on the discussion i had on reddit and other online places !, 
  i was misinformed on some issues and changed my mind of those . 
  i was able to see a wider perspective on others !, 
  i do n't hold the same opinions i did 2 years ago and that is a * good thing * . 
  think of it this way : none of us truly believe we have all the right answers . 
  that would be insane . 
  i am sure not even you believe that . 
  so that means at least one of our opinions , necessarily , is wrong to some extend . 
  however , if i asked you right now which of your opinions are wrong , you would n't think of one because , if you did think one of your opinions is wrong , you would n't hold it . 
  that 's why i am here . 
  i am not here to bring on the glorious european right wing revolution . 
  i am not here to kick people who share your beliefs out . 
  i am here to discuss with people because i know i am wrong . 
  i do n't know what , but i know i am at something . 
  that people are not here to propagandise but to discuss is called having [ good faith ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/good_faith ) and you completely both lack any and give no regards to it when you post . 
  i am truly sorry that you are literally unable to see people in any way other than propagandists . 
  it must be an exhausting world view but , please , stay the fuck away from me . 
  i do n't need your attitude . 
  the evil cabal wins once again . 
  next up : how to grind immigrant babies into a powder for use in eternal life recipes . 
  i thought you would n't respond to my `` evil reactionary posts '' any more ? 
  what happened to that ? 
  i quite enjoyed not having you around . 
  eh , 1 % on a million is the same as 10 % on 100k not that gdp works like that exactly , but as a rule of the thumb , fully developed economies tend to have a slower growth for that reason . 
  ... wait , wrong place .

  this eu of `` let 's pass a treaty or give more money to cause x or y and everything will be ok '' does not work in my opinion . 
  we either change or become irrelevant in this new world in the making . 
  i will say the following as a person who wants the eu to survive . 
  the fact that there is a backlash against the eu has nothing to do with bannon . 
  bannon rides the tide of people bashing the eu . 
  it is the people that have problems with the eu and steve bannon ( or any other anti-eu person ) channels that . 
  trying to look for scapegoats like trump , russia or bannon is absurd . 
  it is like the us elections . 
  the democrats lost and their base ca n't even accept that fact so they keep crying `` russia this , russia that '' . 
  in a democracy things do n't always go our way . 
  that is why we should always listen to every concern . 
  the eu must understand that it is europeans who cry for change . 
  people ask for immigration controls but the eu bureaucrats say `` that 's trump rhetoric '' and dismiss it . 
  people ask for less centralization but eu bureaucrats want to punish the uk for opposing their notion . 
  it is the people that will bring down the eu . 
  they will vote in euroskeptic parties since the pro-european ones ignore their concerns . 
  either we on the pro-european side address the issues or we will have to face the reality of a huge anti-eu wave . 
  and remember even if le pen or wilders fail at these elections they wo n't go away . 
  they will keep fighting . 
  edit : thanks for the gold . 
  appreciate it . 
  tim pool did not use the word extremist but the swedish tv added the word when translating . 
  that is the point . 
  wether * you * believe pjw is an extremist or not is another discussion . 
  this is about swedish tv distorting tim 's sayings . 
  i enjoyed his series . 
  pretty unbiased work ( unlike the swedish tv people who distorted his sayings in the subtitles ) . 
  rare in the journalism of today . 
  that being said i do n't think you need to do investigative journalism in order to understand that not respecting the host culture leads to problems . 
  people who are denying that there is a problem in immigration are in denial . 
  we either address the problem and try and fix it or do n't be surprised if trump-like candidates win every election from now on . 
   jeremy corbyn is a disaster in other news water is wet . 
  the issue with the name is really an issue of history hijacking . 
  they can use the name since their land is where the ancient greek kingdom was . 
  the problems comes when they are trying to forge something completely out of touch with reality . 
  like the `` fact '' that phillip ii or alexander were slavs . 
  ( btw if you think they do n't do that please do yourself a favor and do some research . 
  it is easy if you look for reverse claims . 
  them claiming `` greeks * think * alexander was greek ) everyone who has travelled there knows that their country is like an alexander the great amusement park . 
  statues , roads named after him , centers etc. 
  it is like a small alexander the great disney land . 
  the next generations there will grow up learning that ancient macedonia was slavic when every single historian on the face of the earth knows that this is not the case . 
  ( i can break this down if asked ) they fear that if the name macedonia is taken away from them the truth will emerge . 
  the truth that they are bulgarians . 
  so they want a new identify ? 
  they want to break from their bulgarian past ? 
  forge a new identity based on current struggles for independence . 
  teaching your children lies just for the sake of a pseudonationalist credo is irresponsible and stupid the least . 
  slavomacedonia or vardaska look like great names to me . 
  but i know that will not happen . 
  i am willing to accept the result that will come from negotiation between my country and theirs . 
  just for the sake of stability . 
  we will be supporters of their eu path too . 
  we will settle the matter of historical justice in their own university lecture halls . 
  debating . 
  what different circumstances ? 
  did n't they know about the eu referendum that was coming ? 
  we all knew that the eu referendum was coming . 
  no need to kid yourself . 
  i ca n't believe people still complain about this . 
  it 's over . 
  the scots had a referendum . 
  the uk had a referendum . 
  you do n't get to try again and again untill you get the result you like . 
  jeez . . 
   i 'm a follower of the enlightment revolutionaries , the ones who ended secterian violence on this continent revolutionaries in france slaughtered thousands of people . 
  in the name of radical change . 
  jacobins were murderers . 
  i think you have a pretty romanticized view of the world . 
   you 've barricaded yourself feeding off islamic fundamentalism to feed your own christian one i am not even a christian . 
   my only hope is that we can rebuild after you 've all had your fill of blood in the name of your `` culture '' wow . 
  i really wonder how you view other people . 
  is that it ? 
  i am amazed . 
  `` fill of blood in the name of culture '' . 
  wow . 
  you really make it sound like i am bloodthirsty . 
  are you against nato too ? 
  against military operations in our borders too ? 
  against baltic operations too ? 
  you can wait and dream about revolutionaries all you want but in the end it comes down to interests . 
  you are definatelly not helping your continent 's and alliance 's interests . 
  you are skipping everything i say , then you grab a word and totally avoid all my points . 
  you are being dismissive because you ca n't argue with reason . 
  i just said that you are * probably * a leftist because you were dismissive from the get go when you heard names of academics that reject the general leftist worldview . 
  that of kum ba yah . 
   gotten used to this sort of projection and labelling from other `` clash of civilization '' warriors . 
  you are free to believe that all cultures are equall and that there is no competition ( aggresive if you may ) between them . 
  i would refer you to kissinger 's book world order but you will probably be dismissive of kissinger too . 
   thanks for helping make the world a worse place to live . 
  not an argument . 
  just whining, 
  you clearly have n't read him . 
   we 're all currently dealing with a bunch of right-wing nutcases using his two-bit narrative to excuse the destruction of the enlightenment and the resconstruction of a primitive christio-judaic west , as fellow fundamentalists recreate the same traditionalists revival in the islamic world using the exact same narrative of clash of civilizations . 
  huntington was a lifelong liberal , hated neocons and argued against the war in iraq . 
  here is a [ read ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/29/education/29huntington.html?_r=0 ) right after this death . 
   you might as well quote his inspiration , francis `` end of hisotry '' fukuyama , also a respected academic which shows how little that title is worth . 
  mr. fukuyama is also respected . 
  his works are a big deal in the academic world . 
  you are probably a leftists ideologue that ca n't get over the fact that some things you revered are a thing of the past .

  if you go to a political conversation what makes you think that there should be any sort of praising . 
  about what exactly ? 
  our country 's recent brilliant political maneuvering and our system 's genious establishment ? 
  when i hear in the news about shopkeepers that threaten or even beat up the people that are sent for tax inspection and nothing happens , or we even have videos of bribes in order to turn a blind eye to various offenses even after all the shit that the country has gone through exactly because of illegalities like these , it does make me feel like i 'm living in a third world country that 's destined for failure . 
  feel free to have the illusion that you live in switzerland but do n't expect others to join you in thinking that things will change by praising our country as it is today . 
  change comes from criticism , not from saying `` good job '' . 
  the guy 's a prison escape legend . 
  he got out of jail with a helicopter that casually landed , picked him up and then took off . 
  [ there 's a video too ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyrz9x0fg0k ), 
  they hate the mentality of what we call `` neoellinas '' and the negatives that go with it . 
  do n't worry there , has been and there still is a lot of things we like to praise and brag about our country , we wo n't run short . 
  some self-criticism and self-loathing on things that deserve it wo n't hurt us . 
   your attitude makes this country so much worse hating the system that has made the entire country the laughing stock of europe and is responsible for our current situation is making us worse ? 
  okay mate . 
  these people do n't hate the country as in the land etc. 
  they hate the shitty traits that are ruining us . 
   feel the less european i think he 's talking about greece . 
  look at the chart . 
  it should be pointed out that feeling european and feeling like a eu citizen are two very different things . 
  it 's a technicality since i know that you probably meant the latter but yeah . 
  the greeks feel very european . 
  it 's just that the eu thing has been a bit abiguous lately . 
  interesting i did n't know that . 
  we have some chinese shops in downtown athens and there were plans a few years back for the development of a mini chinatown in the markopoulo area but i have no clue how that went/is going . 
  generally i would n't say many chinese live in athens to my knowledge . 
  well yeah looking for `` undilluted blood '' today is enteirely unrealistic especially when we 're talking about a group of people that have existed for millenia , but the guy actually claims that the ancient greeks vanished entirely in the middle ages so yeah . . 
  i ca n't judge since i 'm not a scholar or anything but it does sound silly . 
  partly true , and i say partly cause while you do typically encounter such comments in those stupid yt videos or from some morons in here , there have actually been some theories from more `` serious '' scholars like fallmerayer . 
  his quote :  the race of the hellenes has been wiped out in europe . 
  physical beauty , intellectual brilliance , innate harmony and simplicity , art , competition , city , village , the splendour of column and temple -- indeed , even the name has disappeared from the surface of the greek continent ... not the slightest drop of undiluted hellenic blood flows in the veins of the christian population of present-day greece . 
  his views are controversial of course but yeah , it 's not your typical nationalistic yt troll . 
  oh yeah always taking photos of every damn thing . 
  you know how the chinese love touristic/historical sites so i 'd say italy is a solid choice, 
  go home king robert , you 're drunk, 
  maybe it 's cause you typed the `` s '' before the slash lol . 
  [ i feel ya mahn ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psc7fzj6u24 ) being interested in history is not the most common thing around . 
  bloody peasants . . 
  not to mention that a lot of people were going on with the `` the modern greeks are not connected to the ancient greeks , they come from slavs and arabs '' bullshit , so i guess some verification is useful . 
  i 'm so disappointed :( it would have been awesome if it was legit . 
  think of all the freckless < 3, 
  linear a ( minoans ) remains undeciphered . 
  linear b ( mycenaeans ) has been deciphered . 
  you can compare the two cases at least as far as the mentality that you used goes . 
  i did n't say that you ca n't do it , i just said that it does n't work that way at least not if you want to be . . legit ? 
  unilatera declarations of whether you owe or not to someone do n't have any merit . 
  perhaps the other party will not be willing to force you , but that does n't mean that you 're not wrong right ? 
  that might be what has happened in this case but it does n't have any legal standing , that 's my point . 
  i was intrigued by the `` king of the offensive one-liners '' reference so i clicked on the link and . . dayum . . the guy fully deserves the above title . 
  damn , i deserve some self-flaggelation . 
  i totally read that as minas tirith . 
  you 're right , it was a good analogy with minas ithil . 
   germany decided that all matters concerning world war ii , including further reparations , are closed . 
  that 's something that has to be agreed with the other party , not unilaterraly decided . 
  greece can decide today that all matters concerning the greek debt is closed but that does n't really have any merit , does it ? 
  i 'm not supporting the reparations demands here but i am going to point out that your logic is flawed . 
  if that was the case then no debt would last for more than 50 years . 
  for example , all greece would have to do is wait 40 years till the politicians that signed the loans and memorandums are dead and then the debts would automatically be erased cause `` the guys that signed them are now dead , it 's not my fault , i do n't owe anything '' . 
  it does n't quite work that way i 'm afraid . 
  i think it would match the siege of vienna more , with the rohirrim matching the hussars charge that broke the siege and all . 
  luis hamilton is british !, 
  i kind of have that too but i do n't think that 's the case cause when i tried pizza in rome i was largely unimpressed , it seemed the same with a few pizza places over here in athens ( inb4 an italian mob crucifies me for that comment ) . 
  when i tried that ice cream shop though ( i tried searching for it and it looks like it was gelateria frigidarium ) , i was like holy shit . 
  no idea what they do with it but i tried it when i was in rome and i was in love . 
  not sure what it was , it just tasted great . 
  great job op , it looks neat !, 
  great job op , it looks neat !, 
  oh lmao yeah i just got it . 
  yeah that `` present-day humans '' probably needs some clarification . 
  ... what are you on about ? 
  how is that undrmining anything in the book ? 
  i love these books to bits . 
  they ` te not . 
  they took samples of cretans due to their location , to compare with the minoan samples . 
  mainlanders would be closer to the mycenaeans so it makes sense that if you want to compare continuity with the minoans you should take a few samples from the same area . 
  lol @ only two samples though . 
  chill it 's an imaginary spin off for shits and giggles . 
  no one 's forcing anything . 
  looks about right, 
  turkey 's location and shape would probably make them mordor ( it has the roughly same rectangular shape ) . 
  plus they 're many and angry :p, 
  looks like we picked the right guy then . 
  hah , no i did n't !, 
  i usually get the `` are you a nazi ?!? '', 
  remark about my nick . 
  this is new and informative xd, 
  the guy is basically a new world war waiting to happen . 
  i 'd throw thomas jefferson in there too . 
   oh , come on . 
  there is both , genetic and linguistic . 
   macedonians on average are slightly more `` diluted '' and they switched the language . 
  that 's all . 
  who supports that exactly ? 
  you can claim that and i can claim that the macedonians that descend from the ancient tribe are the ones that stayed in greece and that the ones in fyrom are a different people ( slavs ) and that 's why they have the different language . 
  occam 's razor . 
  even if some people with that ancestry live in fyrom which is possible , it does n't give fyrom the right to claim that name . 
  i bet that you can find people in the netherlands that can trace their ancestry back to the alemanni but it does n't give the right to the netherlands to claim the name `` germany '' . 
  or there are turks that have greek dna . 
  does it mean that turkey can name itself `` greece '' based on these samples ? 
  they 're in their majority a different country . 
  the bulk of the country is n't macedonian , it 's slavic .

your football tradition is better than ours after all ... sarcastic comments aside , september '04 i moved to edinburgh to study . 
  and lo and behold , my flatmate was portuguese . 
  i mean ... i could n't help it . 
  one of our first conversations was like that : me : `` so , about the euro ... '' him : `` we really should n't talk about that ... '' but , anyway , i bought him pizza that same night and we got along fine . 
  edit : dates, 
  i might be biased because we 're on different parts of the political spectrum , but avramopoulos is seen by many here as a flashy politician with charisma but little substance . 
  \u0399 trust that he 'll do whatever he is told to do , but show little initiative . 
  he wo n't destroy anything , but i ca n't see him being a force for progress , especially where he was placed . 
  wait , we have roller coasters ? 
  where ? 
  i traveled from warsaw to lublin ( and back , a few days later ) and yes the train was old and there was great `` turbulence '' , but it was clean , it ran often enough ( i missed one because of flight delays , took the next one one hour later ) and it was on time . 
  now the taxi driver that took us from the airport to the train station was a whole other story . 
  he asked 80 zloty ( i think ) for the ride and i tried to bargain with him , but he would n't budge . 
  i guess he was one of the scammy taxi drivers the conference organizers had warned us against ( unmarked car , he just came to us in the airport ) . 
  well , there were four of us , so i guess we did n't get ripped off that much . 
  on a side note , i loved lublin . 
  good , cheap food , beautiful place , the weather was surprisingly nice ( it was a surprise for the locals as well ) and the most beautiful women i 've ever seen in my life in one place . 
  quote from a friend : `` we ca n't look creepy if we ask the most beautiful girl for directions . 
  they 're all gorgeous '' . 
  just wear a jacket ... if you can find it among all the winter clothes stashed somewhere ... 
  it 's been a surprisingly cool summer in greece too ... we have n't had a single day over 34 degrees ... 
  be warned that since they used to be a financial newspaper , their coverage on these issues tends to be somewhat pro-market and so on . 
  this is neither good nor bad , it just is . 
  but their other coverage seems pretty neutral ( borderline boring sometimes ) . 
  i do n't follow them that closely , so please let me know . 
  well , there 's only one way to find out ... start reading them more in depth . 
  i just follow them on twitter to be honest and when they have something of interest i click through . 
  you 're right . 
  you can only trust various sources and then your own judgment . 
  having said that , i have a couple of friends who work at naftermporiki.gr and tell me that they never had to censor themselves ( one of them is a former kne , ie member of the communist party ) or accept any kind of guidelines . 
  i am sure there is still some bias , but i somewhat trust naftemporiki ever since then ... somewhat . 
  the greek one is missing a letter . 
  as it is written , it means the scar of greeks ... 
  forget what i said , it 's absolutely correct ... 
  darn it ... i 'm greek catholic ... let me add a few things . 
  1 ) if something starts , you can definitely say `` good < something  '' and it will work as a wish . 
  good day , good evening , good week , good month , good year , good school year , good summer , good work ( as in the one you 're about to do ) ; they all work . 
  2 ) vacations only count if there 's a beach within walking distance . 
  preferably in a house owned by yourself/some ( read : any ) relative . 
  3 ) artistic liberties aside , my big fat greek wedding was pretty accurate in many things . 
  for example , i have my paternal grandpa 's name and my dad has his paternal grandpa 's name and so on , almost ad infinitum . 
  and parents do buy houses for/to their kids ( this is not so frequent nowadays ) . 
  whenever i go to a foreign country i always make sure to ask if the tap water is drinkable . 
  i was told in germany that the water is perfect , so i drank from there . 
  in england they told me something like `` sure , it 's fine , whatever '' , so i still drank from the tap . 
  when i was in poland ( lublin to be exact ) i asked the polish organizers of the conference the same question and their answer was a resounding no . 
  so , bottled water for me . 
  besides , everything was so cheap there ( whole pizza for like 2-3 euros ) , so it did n't really cost me much . 
  by the way , water in athens is probably better than bottled water , but when you go to the islands your mileage may vary . 
  it will definitely not kill you , but you 've tasted much better water in your life . 
  well , you * can * flush paper down the toilet . 
  you just do n't want to . 
  on a similar note , though , all these horror stories about clogged toilets and getting plungers and whatnot i 've seen on reddit ( usually by americans ) do n't really happen in greece . 
  in my 33 years of life , i do n't think i 've ever seen a clogged toilet . 
  but we do have lids on our bins . 
  i hear ya ... 
  metternich really did n't like the 1821 greek revolution against the ottoman empire . 
  you wo n't believe the things we 're taught about him ... edit : i was going for a joke there , but i am trying the hardest to remember what else we were taught about austria in our very greek-centric history books and i ca n't think of many things . 
  well , there is the big stuff like austrian-hungarian empire and world wars , but nothing that went into more depth . 
  hmmm ... can any other greeks help me out here ? 
  was n't i paying attention or did austria really fly under the radar in the few pages of world history i remember ? 
  [ this only partially answers your question , but it 's a good palce to start . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_christmas_gift-bringers_by_country ), 
  well , i did n't say `` we 've always been pronouncing '' now , did i ? 
  the point is , we do n't really know how the ancient greeks pronounced it . 
  what you cited is the linguists ' consensus ( see the p.s. 
  in my original post ) . 
  but in my greek ears , the ancient greek words work perfectly with \u03b2 pronounced as v and in the languages that descend from latin , it sounds `` right '' to be pronounced as b. 
  where is a time machine when you need one ? 
  it 's not ambiguous for us  . 
  we always pronounce ' \u03b2 ' as ` v ' . 
  in any dialect . 
  you should go ask the romans what they did with it ... ps : for the linguists out there : i know , i know ... forgive me ...

  i do n't know of any greeks that claim we have invented kebab . 
  it 's not even a greek word . 
  we do have gyros , though , which is made in a similar way ( the vertical spit ) , but the meat is so much different . 
  gyros is from pork and it uses whole pieces of meat . 
  kebab ( the one i know at least ) is usually minced lamb . 
  which came first ? 
  i have no idea . 
  both are really tasty , though i am partial to gyros . 
  and the only hungarian person i 've met was very adamant that they are not in fact huns . 
  luckily , in my language we use both words to describe them , so i kind of already knew what she was talking about .

  well , the rating is supposed to indicate the risk of investment for any potential lenders . 
  the better the rating , the lesser the ( perceived ) risk . 
  the lesser the risk , the lower the interest rates for said loans . 
  the lower the interest rates , the easier for a country to repay the loans and not spiral into debt . 
  this upgrade in rating means that interests rates for greece can go down . 
  this means nothing ( for now ) , however , since greece is n't borrowing from the market , anyway . 
  but these fitch/moody 's / s&p people have been known to make mistakes . 
  then what onlyalevel2druid said is correct . 
  you probably had poor instruction .

i am well aware that he left syriza , but can you you tell me which party did he form and what percentage of the votes did that party get in the last greek elections ? 
  how about you take a minute and google the results of the last greek elections in order to learn that varoufakis ' party won the elections ? 
  lol , no, 
  ahh , yes . 
  i forgot to say that we greeks ** did ** fuck up big time . 
  major reforms have to take place here in greece . 
  but you forget that not everyone was living the dream .

  some people indeed `` deserve to be treated bad '' but for the last 5 years they are not !, 
  not everyone has the same ** exact ** share of responsibility and the last 5 years have not been equally shitty for everyone . 
  justice must be served but that 's not what is happening these last years . 
  and i also do n't understand why the bankers , that were giving out loans like there was no tomorrow , bear absolutely no responsibility and they have to be saved no matter what the cost is . 
  exactly . 
  oh , but i am partying . 
  it 's just that i have so much fun watching all of you guys going crazy about syriza ( `` dem commies '' , `` kick 'em out now '' , `` they took our monies ! '' ) . 
  throwing all that mud at them without even once actually seeing what they say and what they suggest ( varoufakis specifically ) and then criticize that . 
  i wonder why none of you does that ... 
  thanks for not answering though . 
   they do n't have to follow the eu 's plans why the hell should they ? 
  is n't that what they were doing the last 5 years ? 
  where did that get us ? 
   and in return they do n't get the eu 's money . 
  we 're gon na have to wait and see about that one ...   ... thats like ** me ** ... ** my neighbor ** has to pay ... if ** i ** just stay ... ** i ** still get the money but ** my ** neighbor suffers the ol' `` a country 's economy is just like a household .

   greece did n't have to accept the bailout funds from the imf at all . 
  right . 
  there were n't any guns pointed at anyone ...  debts were written off in 2010 and 2012 . 
  there were n't any debt 's written off in 2010 . 
  and the ones in 2012 were too little too late . 
  but who cares about the debt when the conditions attached to the `` bailouts '' are bound to destroy the economy ? 
   the eu has a 2 billion programme for unemployed young greeks . 
  [ this one ? 
  ] ( http://www.aa.com.tr/en/economy/481397--eu-to-give-greece-2-billion-for-economic-boost ) i do n't , the eu is moving too fast , maybe they should wait another 5 years and see what happens . 
  ** / s **  perhaps you could explain what more help greece should become perhaps ** you ** can explain to ** us ** [ this one ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/priorities/jobs-growth-investment/plan/index_en.htm ) . 
  why are they doing this ? 
  why so ~ ~ late ~ ~ early ? 
  i like the fact that propaganda can come only from one side ( syriza ) and not the other one ( eu ) . 
   promissing the impossible and then realizing that they ca n't deliver on their promises this reminds me of something ... about some `` bailouts '' and their conditions that were supposed to bring growth or something ? 
  anyone remember that ? 
  and now they 're doing something called qe and talk about a european investment plan ? 
  what happened to austerity guys ? 
  interesting last paragraph . 
  yes , of course . 
  treating symptoms is the best course of action we could possibly follow . 
  look mate , i 'm not going to explain every little thing for you to understand it . 
  i said tanks and subs as an example in order for the geniuses like you to get the goddamn gist . 
  obviously , this did not happen ... 
   greece does n't have many achievements to show . 
  i simply told you what we have to show . 
  same excellent purchase decisions ( among other excellent decisions ) , for which no one ever said : `` hmm , that does n't look like it 's gon na end well . 
  maybe we should stop giving them all that money ... '' . 
  that 's simply not true . 
  we have a lot of german tanks and cars and submarines . 
  we are some of the best customers of germany . 
  you know germany , with their amazing export-driven economy ... 
   yes most of the money did not go to greece ... but why should it ? 
  exactly !, 
  the money had to go to those hard-working and good-willing bankers that have to be rewarded for their hard and honest work , no matter what !!, 
  those poor bankers were tricked by those treacherous greeks into giving them money !, 
  do n't get me wrong . 
  the greek society has a lot of problems that have to be addressed . 
  when we started firing all those civil servants i was kinda glad that that 's what was happening . 
  turns out it was n't . 
  5 years later and we are in worse position from the one we started .

   two weeks ago , tsipras was standing safely on morale high ground when he rightfully demanded compensations from germany for the forced greek loans by the nazis . 
  and how exactly did that turn out for him ? 
  everyone was saying that tsipras is playing the nazi card to extort more money , thus germany must not yield . 
  and standing on morale high ground does n't really help our economy . 
   now , he turns around and tries to get close with the one country in europe/asia that annexed ... 
  i know it 's kinda fucked , but did anyone tried to consider why he does that ? 
  that maybe he feels that he is in a very bad situation ? 
  it does n't seem so ... 
  lol . 
  so much butthurt in this thread !!, 
  indeed , for me it 's cheap lie , for many greeks though it 's the sad sad truth . 
  it 's bureaucracy . 
  learn to spell . 
  i had 100 $ . 
  i was between buying food for a month and paying for electricity , water , etc. 
  or paying my taxes . 
  now i 'm a tax evader . 
  i really like it when you say things i have n't said . 
  i really do !!, 
   suddenly stop importing german products i never said that . 
  i said not being able to import . 
  i wonder how come and you did n't notice that ...  just to support your anti-german bias of course , whatever you like . 
  lol . 
  care to enlighten me as to why the ez was constructed ? 
  you seem to know everything and have a solution about everything . 
  yeah ... about that ... it was millions after all . 
  800 million . 
  germany is a `` well functioning smooth machine '' as long as there are countries able to consume its products . 
  if those countries stop consuming germany 's products then the `` well functioning smooth machine '' will run out of oil and die ... 
  it is obvious from our conversation that you have absolutely no idea how economies work in a global level . 
  i suggest that you read a little bit about keynes , bretton woods , surplus recycling and beggar-thy-neighbour policy .

  and lets not forget the word kimono !, 
  someone that kills animals for entertainment died doing exactly that . 
  ca n't say i 'm sad * shrugs *, 
  cause sometimes friendship can go beyond your opinion about the planet 's shape . 
  he might be a really great person that has helped him through a critical time and has proven his friendship and well-mannerism . 
  sometimes your friends can be or appear to be silly and still be your friends you know . 
  hey , my best friend is a christian !, 
  good luck with the philippines amigo . 
  a couple that i found ( in greek ) http://www.cnn.gr/news/ellada/story/84413/amyntaio-allaxe-o-xartis-meta-tin-katolisthisi-anagkastiki-apallotriosi-oikismoy-pics-vid http://www.lifo.gr/now/greece/148243, 
  it 's a horrible death truly . 
  horrible news , i hope most of the people if not all managed to get out but people were reporting that flashlights and cellphone lights could be seen from the rooms so there are still people alive there :(, 
  yes i picked up on that mate . 
  it was n't against you personally . 
  i just meant that many hungarians in here sounded like a right-winged backwards xenophobic and in many cases homophobic prick . 
  i know it sounds rude , i 'm not generalizing , i 'm sure not everyone is like that but sadly , it 's my just experience with the majority in here . 
  you think wrong . 
  i 'm well aware . 
  i simply gave my own point of view half jokingly . 
  you seem to be as bright as a black hole and twice as thick so i 'll try to dumb it down for you by saying that i was talking about overpopulation . . on a global scale like i mentioned . 
  it 's not a matter of whether you 're a parent that can provide for their offspring or not . 
  when the very planet 's resources are running low , we 'll all be the second kind . 
  i really hate to say it and honestly i mean no offence by that , but the overwhelming majority of the hungarian community in reddit makes me think that orban is actually a pretty mellow fella compared to them . 
  the butthurt is strong in you , young padawan . 
  exactly . 
  the swastika was n't a hate symbol before it actually became one due to how it was used . 
  the cross was n't a religious symbol before it was used as one . 
  it was just two crossed lines . 
  edit before the christian hordes put me on the cross ( which would be ironic ) : not implying that the cross is a hate symbol , just showing how symbols work regardless of their nature . 
  seeing it from a global perspective , if anything we should start having less children . 
  unless we happen to find a spare planet . 
  well it 's not like we 're inviting them over here or anything . 
  i 'm for sending them back too , at least the ones that actually do n't come from war zones but it 's kind of a hard thing to do when the countries like tunisia or wherever they 're coming from , wo n't recognize them and take them back in . 
  and between you and me , why would they ? 
  same thing was happening with turkey until the deal was signed and they got money to accept them back and actually do something to keep them from leaving their shores . 
  unless the same thing happens with these countries we ca n't really avoid what 's happening, 
  i do n't disagree . 
  a lot of them are n't compatible . 
  but i 've yet to see a reasonable way of solving the problem . 
  and my point was that even after the natives had lost their land and the settlers ran the place , a shitload of people ( more settlers ) kept coming from all over the world . 
  the country was founded on collecting all sorts of people from wealthy lords to piss-poor wretches to straight out criminals . 
   * not like the brazen giant of greek fame , with conquering limbs astride from land to land ; here at our sea-washed , sunset gates shall stand a mighty woman with a torch , whose flame is the imprisoned lightning , and her name mother of exiles . 
  from her beacon-hand glows world-wide welcome ; her mild eyes command the air-bridged harbor that twin cities frame . 
  `` keep , ancient lands , your storied pomp ! '', 
  cries she with silent lips . 
  `` give me your tired , your poor , your huddled masses yearning to breathe free , the wretched refuse of your teeming shore . 
  send these , the homeless , tempest-tost to me , i lift my lamp beside the golden door !, 
  '' * this is one of the most known welcome signs , it 's the inscription on the statue of liberty . 
  so again . . do you think that all these were angels ? 
  now i 'm not saying that europe should necessarily become a multinational melting pot like the usa , i 'm just saying that it does n't necessarily mean that these people are all evil . 
  `` turn them back laws be damned '' and start a war with the country that would stop my coast guard boats from violating their borders . 
  yes that makes perfect sense . 
  i 'm not against closing the migrant routes , i 'm against retarded ideas that include shooting or sinking boats with men women and children in the name of the camel 's back and preserving cultural identity . 
  we have n't reached that point just yet . 
  perhaps it would have been but the funny thing is that most peope would argue that the settlers actually did make america a better place to live in . 
  anyway , the point was simple . 
  angels or not , you ca n't really tell when you 're saving them from sinking boats in the mediterranean , can you now ? 
  what is our friend above suggesting ? 
  letting them drown cause `` they 're not angels '' ? 
  well i 'm not really informed on this either and i 'm not sure how this is suggested to be implemented unless countries like tunisia and egypt are aboard and agree to take the immigrant/refugees/whatever back . 
  like i said , i do n't think the italian coastguard can simply enter tunisian waters and leave them there so yeah . . i do n't know how this will play out . 
  if there 's an agreement similar to the one with turkey then yeah maybe . 
  until then , picking those people up , although problematic is obviously preferable than watching them drown all over the mediterranean least they disturb our way of life . 
  hungary you 're wearing your flag upside down !, 
  well typically when the western countries violate borders like that , it 's followed by bombings so that 's one more reason why it 'd be unreasonable i guess . 
  what do you mean by `` you think they 're angels '' ? 
  do you think the people living in your country are angels ? 
  what would you suggest ? 
  questionaries with questions like `` are you a nice person ? '', 
  that the refugees have to fill in quickly as their boat sinks in the mediterranean ? 
  obviously many are n't angels . 
  just like a shitload of the settlers that went to the americas were scum . 
  what 's your point ? 
  because you ca n't save them and then violate another country 's sea borders and disembark on their islands to drop people off . 
  if italy saves them , italy has to take them in . 
  or let them drown . 
  i think the former is the reasonable ( although inconvenient ) thing to do . 
  edit : downvote this all you like but do tell me what of the above is wrong please . 
  and the dinosaur !, 
  and goats . 
  lots of goats !, 
  probably more damage was caused in greece than turkey . 
  i 'm reporting poseidon for friendly fire . 
  do n't be silly , the el fleet is parked on the dark side of the moon . 
  this is common knowledge but shhh, 
  sure . 
  but they 're fixated with macedonia so . . you convince them to change it to western bulgaria , it 's fine by us lol, 
  well the government in greece actually does n't do that . 
  that 's a good thing . 
  and even if it did , it 'd at least be true so there 's also that . 
  two things that fyrom ca n't claim . 
  and baklava mmm, 
  same with athens . 
  man that 's far . 
  yeah it 's so accurate we 're not even mad . 
  most studies i 've seen agree that greeks have had a continuity in the area since the ancient times , at least on reasonable levels considering the thousands of years that have passed . 
  one article i found that has references on different biological/archaeological studies , might help you : http://dienekes.awardspace.com/articles/fallmerayer/, 
  where did you see that ? 
  as many as a nation can have with its ancestors 2500 years ago . 
  language , alphabet and a continual presence in the area . 
  we do n't hear chitons and sacrifice to zeus anymore .

  for some reason you choose to ignore that , and the fact that the name 's being used for nationalistic reasons and creates a tie to northern greece and its history , and you argue for the arguments sake . 
  i 'm sure that you acknowledge what fyrom 's doing but for your own unknown reasons you simply ignore it . 
  a geographical distinctive would for the most part solve the issue but fyrom was n't co-operating there . 
  cuprus was one before it was split . 
  and when it was split the northern part was named '' ** northern ** cyprus '' ( officially the turkish republic of northern cyprus - which btw nullifies your earlier comment that `` there 's no reason for a `` northern '' in the name since there is no sovereign country with `` southern '' . 
  well there 's no `` southern cyprus '' either and look at that . 
  northern cyprus got a geographically distinctive just to separate it from cyprus . 
  not so international standards after all huh ? 
  greece is one country . 
  the other hellenic country gained its independence and used a different name so this example is not only irrelevant but is actually working against the point you 're trying to make . 
   artificial difference created after wwii . 
  and our difference with the `` macedonians '' is being created now  why are you complaining about it ? 
   geographically it 's correct and up to the standards of international community . 
  what standards are these ? 
   that 's just a very silly assumption . 
  and that 's a very simple and baseless dismissal . 
  explain to me why it 's a silly assumption please ? 
   there 's no point to that name . 
  there 's no sovereign country in the world called `` southern macedonia '' or even `` macedonia no , there is a wider area and the name `` northern macedonia '' would clearly indicate that it 's a republic situated on the north of the wider area bearing that name . 
  good for belgium for dealing with that in this way . 
  although i doubt that they 'd have much to lose from giving away luxemburg 's name and history . 
  greece however , would like to not do the same to our neighbors when its clear that they 're using the name for nationalistic purposes . 
  germany is not the only germanic * state . 
  it is however the only state with `` germans '' as its people . 
  there 's a difference . 
  croatia contains dalmatia . 
  would the croats be ok with the bosnians renaming their country to dalmatia ? 
  would the albanians be ok with fyrom renaming itself to illyria ? 
  would the romanians be ok with hungary taking the name transylvania like i said above ? 
  i 'm not interested in other countries frankly . 
  perhaps poland would be ok with doing that but greece is n't ok with handing a huge part of its history to a country that has no connection with it . 
  like i explained above , the name as it is now is wrong both historically and geographically, 
  yes because the myth could be abandoned and then they could start with it again . 
  would you have a problem with a name like northern macedonia which is also geographically correct ? 
  i answered you about that on my other comment . 
  other than the geographical region , `` macedonia '' is also the name of an ancient greek kingdom and `` macedonians '' were its people . 
   so is it about the name , or their stupid nationalism ? 
  those are clearly two separate issues butgreeks seem to think they 're one and the same . 
  fyrom seems to think it 's the same thing too , not just the greeks . 
  since they 've built a shitload of statues of alexander and they promote the idea that they 're his heirs . 
  so yeah . . there 's a problem here . 
   just because the government is retarded and claims greek history does n't mean there 's anything wrong witht the name . 
  read your sentence again and again until you spot what 's wrong with it . 
  the very fact that the name allows them to claim greek history does cause a big problem . 
  what 's to stop them from using the name to claim something that goes beyond the area , aka the ancient macedonian kingdom and its history . 
  they already renamed their airport to alexander the great so clearly , they 're not using it only in the geographical sense . 
  europe is the name of the wider area in which greece is as well . 
  should greece change its name to europe ? 
  it 's not as simple as you make it sound . 
  the area of macedonia is shared by 4 countries so at the very least , it should have a distinctive like `` norther macedonia '' . 
  being called just `` macedonia '' is wrong both geographically and because it automatically ties them with the ancient kingdom and people that bore exactly that name . 
  no problem, 
  `` coping '' a culture or being inspired by it is very different than usurping one 's history . 
  the romans/italians never claimed that phyrrus or miltiades were romans . 
  the fact that the romans were inspired so much by greek culture is not a bad thing . 
  the went beyond that and had many breakthroughs of their own , creating an amazing civilization even if it was heavily based on the greek one . 
  at least they admired the greek civilization and embraced it , they did n't seek to copy it and then erase it ( well maybe during the christian era with all the pagan witch hunt but that 's different ) . 
  i see no problems with the aeneid . 
  the trojans were n't really considered greek anyway , although they were close . 
  and for all we know , the whole trojan war thing could be a myth . 
  this is but one story about the founding of rome . 
  it 's not the only one . 
  you can read more about it here https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/founding_of_rome besides even if that was the case and the romans did descend from aeneas , it does n't take anything away from greek history . 
  yeah no one cares about that , unless the thing starts getting out of hand . 
  it 's not an issue of whether or not they can hurt us . 
  we 'd be able to deal with them easily , yes , but that does n't make it any less of a problem . 
  not quite cause at least the name macedonia , is also being used for the wider geographic area . 
  this is what 's causing all the confusion . 
  one could use it in a geographical sense but it would also at the same time imply that it 's the same country with the ancient greek kingdom which is false . 
  `` albania '' however is only the name of the country , not the wider region . 
  so a name like `` east albania '' would make even less sense . 
  if it was `` east illyria '' it could make some sense cause illyria like macedonia are both wider areas . 
  but in the same way , if you called the people from fyrom illyrians it would trigger the albanians and rightfully so cause the slavs came to this area much later than the illyrians which were the albanians ' ancestors . 
  generally , using a name that 's already being used by another country , or the name of a civilization that existed before you , is a bad idea . 
  when did that happen ? 
  when the romans did what ? 
  sorry i did n't get your point . 
  it would still be wrong so no . 
  like it was mentioned above , republic of northern macedonia was suggested by greece since it has a geographical distinction but it was rejected . 
  apparently fyrom 's nationalists wanted to have the ability to tie themselves with the ancient macedonians . 
  if greece allows chunks of its history to be usurped by other countries , even if it does reach that glory it wo n't be `` her former glory '' anymore . 
  that 's not the point . 
  like he said , when everyone calls them macedonians , and they themselves start promoting the propaganda building statues and naming their airport `` alexander the great '' ( younger ) people will just accept that these are actual descendants of the ancient macedonians and greece will have automatically lost a big part of its history . 
  for what ? 
  because fyrom is n't an existential or territorial threat to greece ? 
  sorry but that 's even worse . 
  why would we give away our history and allow future generations to be misinformed out of charity to a country that is n't a threat ? 
   a lot of hungarians say that , unfortunately . 
  there has always been tension over that . 
  exactly . 
  that 's why i said it . 
  now imagine the entire world start agreeing with them and calling them transylvania . 
  that 's what 's happening with fyrom . 
  i could be like `` yeah man but everyone 's calling hungary transylvania now cause it 's not a big issue to us '' but it would still be an issue to romania and it would be wrong anyway . 
  that was my point . 
  people might not care about the name but wrong is a wrong and well . . it affects greece . 
  well it is yeah . 
  i was just saying that kostantiniye is just how the turks called it . 
  other countries change the name to fit their language but it 's still the same name . 
  the greeks do n't call athens `` athens '' but `` athina '' .

  it is so big that the same means of transportation are unable to cope with the sheer amount of people . 
  they amass in greek islands unable to leave because they do n't find tickets . 
  they ammass in the northern border because trains in fyrom ca n't get them fast enough . 
  and thtey are still coming . 
  now the congestion has reached serbia and i expect the wave to reach hungary and austria in one month . 
  after that suddenly we will see the lady who always acts too little and too late because she hates large changes to say that enough is enough it is about time we solve this issue . 
  you 'd need a wall to do that . 
  it 's not like they get into fyrom from a border check point , they just walk through some fields and enter the next country . 
  seriously , some islands are a few kilometers away from the turkish shores . 
  do you think that even if we return them back , they will not attampt to come again ? 
  and how close are the countries from where immigrants leave to reach australia ? 
  i ask because you can reach some greek from turkey in 10 to 30 minutes with a boat and people moving them have plenty of time to run back to turkish controled waters when coastguard approaches . 
  one example is samos which is 3km away from the turkish shores , or lesvos which is 10km away . 
  for reference tallin is 70 km away from elsinki . 
  and lapendusa island which is the main entry to italy is more than 100km from the lybian coast . 
  trololol , they do n't come walking in greece . 
  they come in boats . 
  the only alternative we have is to sink them or watch them drown . 
  it is really comfortable being surrounded by sea is n't it ? 
  like saying `` i 'll hold my breath until you do what i want '', 
   instead , this money goes to muslims . 
  i did n't know that christian immigrants can not receive any help . 
   it urged macedonia to `` establish an orderly and protection-sensitive management of its borders '' while appealing to greece to `` enhance registration and reception arrangements '' on its side of the border . 
    the unhcr also said it had been assured by macedonia the border `` will not be closed in the future '' , but did not elaborate . 
   greece itself has seen almost 160,000 people landing on its shores since january , the un estimates , with 50,000 arriving in the past month alone . 
  so what are both countries supposed to do ? 
  greece has a population of 10 millions and received 160,000 people in 8 months . 
  what exactly should we do with all that people ? 
  if we suppose that we process asylum applications , we have to process them in an unprecedented rate and in the meantime support all these people . 
  what are we supposed to do if they want to go on and walk all the way to northern europe ? 
  are we also responsible for the ones who leave schengen and go through fyrom ? 
  because it punishes the border countries for being close to the border saying that they are supposed to keep them or send them back on their own ( and handle the same people that enter again and again ) . 
  it 's not like we give them tickets to leave . 
  they came to the shores of the meditteranean walking and after crossing the sea they will continue walking . 
  one question is how people are planning to step them without building a wall all around their countries . 
  i wonder how is it possible that i have never come across that one ^ ^, 
  interesting . 
  i have read about how many germans were forced to move to what germany is today but never thought about the impact it would have on how people see immigration today . 
  it is more accurate to say that cities like k\u00f6nigsberg were german before wwii . 
  hm , looking at this : do you think the bailout package will prevent greek from going bankrupt ? 
  76 % no do you agree with a debt relief for greece ? 
  ( now ) 61 % no i wonder what is a viable solution according to the german people . 
  i doubt anyone questions the actions of the police so far . 
  the situation is really unsolvable . 
  no , its like two retarded people getting slapped by people passing by and they still argue with each other about them slapping each other in the past . 
  and here we come to the point . 
  could we ask them to build a wall and tell them not to let anyone leave threatening people with guns ? 
  just keep in mind that only specific areas are affected . 
  you would see immigrants around if you visit an eastern island or downtown athens ( which imo is ugly with or without them ) . 
   feeling that we were walking money bags people wanted to extract as much profit from as possible huh , i always feel ashamed that some greeks do the same but i 'm at least glad that we are ahaid of the competition . 
  our turkish friends can correct my if i am wrong about this . 
  from what i read , my understandning is that in many muslim states ( turkey included ) , the state is not kept together solely by people belonging to the same nation but islam also keeps these states functioning , people can sympathise more with others etc. 
  again i am not an expert on the matter but i think that turkish people would be way more concerned if the refugees were christian . 
  as winter comes it will become harder to cross the eagean so the rate immigrants come will also be smaller . 
  also , the reason they are stuck there is that all boat tickets are booked till the end of the month meaning that those who will have the money to buy tickets will be able to leave without problems . 
  technically yes , see here for more info : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sappho#sexuality_and_community however we avoid using the word lesbian . 
  the largest city of lesbos is mytilene and we often call the island mytilini . 
  so if we want to say that someone is from there we say that he is from mytilene . 
   these ads do n't work . 
  has this been tested in the past ? 
  i do n't see why there is no chance this will work . 
  we have been doing it for years but in the sea it is very easy for these boats to see that coast guard approaches them and flee back to the turkish controled waters . 
  yes for now there are many stuck on lesbos . 
  around the end of the month they will be able to find some tickets to leave though . 
  you are free and ask the un first to change what is recognised as human rights . 
  we are welcome to ideas about how to achive it . 
  right now there are some thousands in a few greek islands and because of the large number of tourists all transportation by sea are booked and they are unable to leave till the end of month . 
  you need a lot of manpower and resources just to manage those people and find out where they came from and then spend ever more money to send them back . 
  this . 
  same thing happened in some greek islands as the influx was so great that it was impossible to accept so many people and give them the typical few days long permit . 
  to make matter worse , many ended up in islands where all sea transportation was sold out and are unable to leave . 
  cmon , you are not supposed to be funny xdddd . 
  just wait till you become the equivalent of washington dc which has no local government :p, 
  next time nato tries to destabilize another region close to europe we should have the guts to stop this madness as this will mean more immigrants to us . 
  europe is supposed to be able to protect itself without being played by us foreign policy . 
  hahaha , do you think that it will stop them from living in the streets ? 
  it still does n't remove the incentive to go there . 
  please , be more accurate . 
  21,000 migrants hit greek shores from turkey . 
  its almost as if they try to get as much as possible of their money back . 
   emotionalizing hate propaganda keep in mind that the press also fueled this as a way to avert people from targetting the oligarchs controling the media . 
   italy has even begun to turn back boats of refugees . 
  and italy was punished for such actions . 
  what 's funny is that some countries think that they can get away with immigration just by doing nothing . 
  at least sweden does something ( even though it does n't help to stop the immigration wave ) . 
  its amazing how the turkish invasion looks like the case of crimea , yet nobody cares . 
  and our good for nothing union does nothing for that ... 
  i would really love to see europe as a single state where the best parts help the worst parst , modernise , fight fraud and coruption and actually help run the state in a more logical way . 
  speaking for myself , i have already accepted that we wo n't really pay all that debt ( or most of it ) but how we will end up really is up to us greeks to give up some of our stupid pride and let some germans or french help us build a decent state . 
  the creditors are asking the imf to participate and the responce is actually that they wo n't participate unless the creditors accept to include debt relief in the bailout . 
  moreover all creditors are members of the imf and already agree with its rules saying that the debt to imf should never be restructured . 
  i see it more like a call saying that if the creditors want their assistance and money , they should create a viable plan first . 
  i hope greece is next . 
   also i blame your electoral system . 
  why give away 16.67 % of your seats ( and voting power ) to the largest political party ? 
  the results is something similar to the uk 's fptp . 
  though there is no really good party anyway . 
  the last 2 decades the main political parties changed the law several times to give a bigger bonus of seats to the party that gets the most votes , in order for them to keep successing the other and getting absolute majority in the parliament dispite the fact that people kept losing faith in both of them . 
  i completely agree . 
  this is a very important point .

  on the other hand , turkey was the one who genocided 1.5 million armenians and no one else . 
  except , you know , we did n't kill them outside of execution of ** war criminals ** . 
  the albanian state did . 
  are we genociders because the albanian ssr took a look at nazi collaborators and did n't like what they saw ? 
  aromanian were never forbidden . 
  they just were not officially taught ... and why would they be ? 
  greece is , as the name might imply , the land of the greeks where the official language is greek . 
  if you are not greek and live here , great , but expecting the greek state to cater to you is absurd . 
  nor did modern greece ever have an empire with multiple peoples under it which would make enfranchisement a reasonable expectation . 
  we were , and are , definitionally a nation-state . 
  there is nobody forbidding aromanian . 
  we do n't support it within our system , sure , but active persecution never happened . 
  aromanian died because aromanian communities ( along with everyone else ) moved to large city centres ( athens/thessalonika ) where preserving their culture was not really possible . 
  up to 60-70 years ago , aromanian were common . 
  as for this case , read the wikipedia article https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/expulsion_of_cham_albanians chams were active nazi collaborators . 
  and even then , we only killed a small number with most being killed by the albanian state ( because they were nazis ) . 
  yep !, 
  these are/were the arvanites and , today , they are basically indistinguishable from greeks . 
  they are seen as fully greek , many of arvanite ancestry are political leaders etc the chams were a different story . 
  they were nazi collaborators , murderers and traitors . 
  expulsion was being nice to them . 
  no seriously , what ? 
  bulgarians maybe have a case , but albanians ? 
  arvanites were never killed , they got integrated . 
  if that is genocide , the us is the most murderous state on earth , followed by canada . 
  edit : apparently it referred to [ this ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/expulsion_of_cham_albanians ) some notes : 100k is an impossible number as , in total , they were about 50.000 they were expelled because they were , en mass , nazi collaborators . 
  while some were killed by edes ( right wing paramilitary that operated mostly in epirus . 
  my grandpa was part of em ) , the majority killed were actually by the albanian state which tried a lot of them and promptly executed them . 
  tl ; dr : they were nazi collaborators and , even then , it was n't us doing the killing mostly .

  hello and thank you deeply for doing this ama . 
  the green party has the officially policy of condemning nuclear energy . 
  many , including myself , consider that misinformed . 
  while green energy production is obviously preferred , we are far away from the point where we would be sufficient with green energy alone . 
  currently , we mainly use fossil fuels . 
  these tend to be more dangerous and more radioactive than nuclear factories . 
  while we obviously aim for the optimum , why the hard-line stance against nuclear energy , even as a stepping stone ? 
  like , not being racist is fine and all , but what the fuck 's that has be to do with his memory ? 
   white trash that is a racial slur . 
  please do n't use it in the future . 
  your comment was removed . 
  i did n't warn you because you are a turk , i warned you for this part . 
   afaik there are orders to deport and they have disregarded deaths but never have i seen any order to kill them during deportation . 
  if ignoring and disregarding reports is committing genocide i am pretty sure many of the famines in the world were preventable , thus genocides . 
  this is both false and against the officially accepted historical narrative . 
  it constitutes an attempt at minimizing the armenian genocide and thus the warning . 
  i wo n't get on a long debate about this , nor can i right now . 
  just do n't do it again . 
  i am just stating that saying `` merkel is someone to disassociate with '' is kind of absurd . 
  lol , yes you fucking can . 
  merkel is a perfectly reasonable politician . 
  i strongly disagree with her immigration policies and some of her handling of the greek crisis but to pretend like she is the unreasonable one is bloody daft . 
  genocide denial , including the armenian genocide , is a bannable offence . 
  we have a 0 tolerance policy on it . 
  this is your one and only warning . 
  i do . 
  / u/executivemonkey is a shitposter extraordinaire . 
  nope , he is not a filthy power hungry * belgian * !, 
  thrace is in europe last time i checked . 
  turkey has about as many people in europe as my country , greece does . 
  it also used to be much larger inside europe . 
  even in the 16th century onwards , europeans signed treaties to recognize the ottomans as a european empire . 
  thus in general we treat turkey as an european country . 
  like with russia though , localized news that are outside of europe are removed . 
  local conflict in the turkish-syrian conflict or something happening in vladivostok . 
  i have never done that in any serious context and i quite like turks . 
  do n't spread lies . 
  but you will get a ton of exposure !, 
  do n't you like exposure ? 
  jokes aside , it 's not for everyone , i agree . 
  we wo n't treat new mods as third tier mods , they will be normal mods , they will just ( probably ) not be permanent . 
  he did whatever the fuck he wanted , he modded with an agenda and he did n't even try to hide it . 
  not being his brand of `` progressivism '' was `` problematic '' . 
  he was a terrible team player and god help us that he still has his fingers in so many subs . 
  eh , karma is not necessarily a good indicator . 
  a couple of funny shitposts could net you that . 
  and how do we do that in reddit ? 
  make a thread and delete all non-viable users ? 
  how do we approve people who want to be mods etc not to mention seeing how long someone is subbed is not actually possible ( as far as i know ) . 
  as far as i know we allow hurriyet ? 
  why ? 
  i agree with your general sentiment .

  i am a person who loves reading news about europe and i can honestly say i did n't stumble to any such article anywhere . 
  this quote can be a good start for an anecdote !, 
  we 've had worse ... 
  they want to steal our show with a spectacular italexit ... dem italians man ... 
  meh it 's not being cynic believing that irrational people exist ... 
  and i 'm telling you 2009 and 2010 is the ** start ** . 
  i have no problem acknowledging anything . 
  i said that the logistics were discovered before the austerity and since late 2009 , start of 2010 is the ** start ** then what i said is true . 
  should i start arguing now that 1 +1 equals 2 ? 
  they did make use of it . 
  noone gave a shit because it 's so obvious as the sky is blue . 
  propaganda did n't help tsipras and varoufakis at all . 
  they even won a referendum with 63 % and still did n't do shit with it . 
  it 's not greek politics . 
  we asked to cut spending on the military and germany straightforward disagreed . 
  plain and simple . 
  mate why are you so mad ? 
  of course i can read a wikipedia article and 2015 minus 6 years is 2009 . 
  your point is that 2009 is n't the start of the austerity measures ? 
  germans want us to spend more on military because we buy everything from them and we still end up owing them the same money . 
  guess who has a win/win scenario !, 
  late 2009 is before the shitstorm started . 
  is this a counter argument ? 
  you are just re-enforcing my original argument . 
  what do you mean by that ? 
  this was discovered before the 6 years of austerity . 
  get your facts straight . 
  ideologically the eu has transformed from a union of unity to a union of creditors and debtors . 
  not much different from a bank and a client . 
  at the moment in greece even if you are a bum living on the street earning nothing , you still are accountable for what is known as `` mandatory income of survival '' on which you are taxed !, 
  there seriously is a `` subscription fee '' just for being greek . 
  oh and to elaborate on your example , if i earn 8000 euros per year and i spend almost all of it just to pay the bills and then i get asked to pay significant amount of it in taxes , where can i get that money to pay ? 
  it 's simple . 
  the tax is disproportionate to the cost of living and i 'm not talking about a luxurious life at all . 
  can you blame them ? 
  a lot of masks have been dropped this week . 
  we do n't kill them and we respect human rights within our means of doing so . 
  they 'll send them back the same way they sent them here in the first place . 
  the more i think about it the more i tend to believe that tsipras hoped for a yes in the referendum to escape this hell and blame it to the people . 
  now he has managed to be the ultimate failure with the exception of showing to the world the true face of europe and who really calls the shots within this so-called `` union '' . 
  oh no do n't worry !, 
  we 'll be in the spotlight in a short while again !, 
  we just ca n't have enough of it !, 
  we 'll always be called lazy tax-evading cunts . 
  you can be sure at least about that !, 
  no matter what we vote or what our majority says or does . 
  they will ignore the people for the time being and you 'll see the opposition voting in favor . 
  dark times for democracy right in the cradle of it . 
  i 'm pretty sure that there wo n't be one single party to form a government in greece for a long while yet . 
  coalition governments will still be needed even though the current election system is actively designed to suppress the rise of such governments !, 
  we had to destroy a couple of banks to construct it by using the wood of the offices . 
  fear the danaans ( ancient greek tribe ) bearing gifts . 
  i 'm sorry i did n't know that . 
  i 'll correct my previous statement . 
  i very much agree with you . 
  twitter is a political game and every tweet is measured to the fullest . 
  he will still held responsible for any outcome . 
  besides , he said it was a necessary move and he is still part of the plan . 
  ~ ~ a minor correction , varoufakis is not elected . 
  he was chosen as finance minister from tsipras . ~ ~ nevertheless , i still think that an official being outed this way is not democratic but we have to take under consideration that it may be a crucial move from tsipras for a better deal , who is in fact elected and has the people 's voice with him . 
  which in and of itself is ridiculous . 
  if recognized academics such as varoufakis , and noone can say that the man does n't have the background to be recognized as such , do n't get a say to events that can turn the course of financial history then i 'm afraid our lucks are left to either ignorant megalomaniacs or a bunch of vultures . 
  quick !, 
  stuff them in the mattress !, 
  i do n't get you . 
  do you mean that incompetence ( which is your opinion btw ) is worse than starting world wars ? 
  every time i see this photo of tsipras and merkel i ca n't help but picture mr. bean in place of tsipras . 
  if german politicians still go with the `` lazy greeks '' motto then there 's nothing you can do about them . 
  you ca n't argue with idiots . 
  are you the creator of these images ? 
  all of it is history , thanks for the lesson, 
  an ** impossible ** task . 
  ftfy, 
  our future ^ ( and present ) is `` grey '' . 
  how could they do that then without having the majority ? 
  bavarians now are the germans , right ? 
  or is it all of the nations which speak german ? 
  my history/geography knowledge lacks on that front . 
  even though potami does n't have a great reputation amongst a lot of people because of its leader , i 'll give you the benefit of doubt that they would n't mess things up too . 
  the question though remains , what did you vote before the previous elections ? 
  before potami ? 
  or are you 18/19 ? 
  i 'm sorry for my friends in cyprus for what 's to come because of us . 
  ehhh no . 
  what he said is that portugal will most probably default as well right after greece exits the ez . 
  by then greece will have done everything you said again , only on drachmas . 
  could you tell us which ones you would elect ? 
  because as far as i know all that was left is either the communism party or the golden dawn party . 
  are you with one of them ? 
  which one ? 
  whatever it was , it appears that now they do n't need it as much . 
  which begs the question , does anyone working in imf pay taxes ? 
  defaulting is definitely not a new start . 
  the debts are n't magically erased . 
  v for venus ? 
  it 's about time we go there too !, 
  the difference between swedish people paying vat and greek people paying vat ** nowadays ** is that greek people get shitty public services back in contrast to swedish public services . 
  this leads them towards not trusting the government with their money . 
  greek government officials have been corrupt a loooooong time now and i would be glad if europe officials help us throw them in the sea with a stone around their necks because apparently we ca n't do it on our own . 
  ... corruption ... everywhere ...

  there are many references and articles about that . 
  many economists mainly from the us and uk pointed that without a debt cut the programs are n't viable without the debt cut . 
  they 've done so years ago . 
  this is a german made documentary about it . 
  it is very eye opening and i think it 's good to see it . 
  if you do n't want to see it all you can skip to around 7:35 and see what imf board members say on the matter and how at the start of the programs they had objections about it for the reasons we are talking here : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwud0mqu3qk it had english subtitles . 
  here 's an article from the telegraph telling it as it is : http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/economics/11654639/imf-has-betrayed-its-mission-in-greece-captive-to-emu-creditors.html, 
  this is absurd !, 
  australia only competed for the 1st time ever this spring and now they want to renounce the eurovision ?!?!?!, 
  shame on you australia !, 
  shame !, 
  not a cultural thing . 
  there are two reasons : - since the start ( i.e. 
  jan ) they stated they would n't sign an agreement that would n't be viable . 
  from what i understand they conceded on almost everything with the troika but the debt cut was left out . 
  such a deal they could n't possibly present to the people as it would be their political death . 
  so in a way it was their way out of an impossible situation . 
  - the proposals were surely not viable . 
  imf only today gave the info to the press and itself recognizes the program ( any program ) will not be viable without a debt cut . 
  by calling the referendum they succeeded to draw vast publicity to this . 
  it was a known fact and the anglosaxon economists told so many times . 
  but now it is known and accepted by anyone . 
  it came to be a public fact . 
  as wikileaks revealed the germans knew that for 3 years now but they pretended otherwise . 
  all and all i think the outcome is irrelevant as new negotiations will start next week . 
  after all this , it is not far fetched for them to think they 'll get a few points in the chess game having a `` no '' with them cause they will use it as leverage to gain a better deal, 
  well the situation could be a full episode of the `` twilight zone '' . 
  we are being called to vote on accepting or not , a proposal that no more exists . 
  in the mean time our government even made a new proposal that was denied . 
  our government says vote no so we continue the negotiations on better terms ( have people 's back up ) and it is not about leaving the euro . 
  everyone else is saying that it is about leaving the euro . 
  the imf today let the world to know that all plans that do n't include a debt cut ( as the one we are voting on and does not exist anymore ) are not going to work . 
  now how cool is that ?

  when i hear varoufakis and tsipras say that , i am sure they are lost . 
  the guy is a bad joke . 
  some things he says might by correct but he has no idea on how politics work . 
  he and tsipras ( a political dwarf and opportunist ) are destoying my country using all the propaganda tricks in the book ( pleas to justice , humanism , patriotism whatever ) . 
  the road to hell is paved with `` good intentions '' and they are doing just that .

  ever !, 
  as i understand it , this is the face of `` hypocrisy '' . 
  the panic . 
  they created that on their own too . 
  i find it disgusting to blame a german politician about it . 
  i do agree my friend !, 
  spot on !, 
  schengen is a true european conquest against a fractured and dark past . 
  it is our duty to defend schengen . 
  this is nonsense !, 
  the guy said what he had every right to say . 
  he doesnt trust them ( varoufakis and tsipras ) so why should he risk their money and time ? 
  he made a legitimate statement and i find it hypocritical to start the `` ooh !, 
  he is against democracy '' mantra . 
  i dont trust them either !, 
  syriza 's propaganda is getting more and more hideous . 
  i despair ... 
  i think it 's half truth which certainly makes it a lie . 
  many companies can not work now that the banks are closed . 
  many gave their staff a leave since they would have nothing to do . 
  it is not far fetched for some owner to tell his/her employers that depending on the outcome their business might close . 
  that is a reality and hardly can be called a black mail . 
  everyone votes in secrecy . 
  no employer can check what the employees vote . 
  such articles a shit . 
  exactly !, 
  tsipras logic . 
  hahahhahahaha, 
  did i say that it isnt a problem in greece ? 
  what i say is that it 's not the cause of the current crisis . 
  of course they can ( have a good time ) !, 
  but seriously , that is mostly a show . 
  seriously : greeks hate no one . 
  what kind of answers do you expect when we are bombarded again and again with the same cliches , skin deep analysis and lectures on morality from almost every dumb keyboard warrior out there ? 
  think of it !, 
  even you ask `` if we see you as enemies '' without even wonder why they hell such a thing would be . 
  on the other hand you 've certainly seen again and again : greeks are lazy , greeks dont pay their taxes , greeks blame everyone but themselves , greeks want to destroy euro etc etc. 
  i am greek and i am very close to believe that the best thing the world can do is to nuke us and then the world will be a paradise . 
  i prefer to imagine more difficult things : a world where people dont use cliches over and over again . 
  kicking a dead horse is something you get your kicks then ?

  they show lack of respect for the victims and their families though .

  3 % of people think blair is not blairite, 
  the french are as productive as the germans . 
  they have lower gdp per capita because they choose to work less hours .

  lol . 
  you people ca n't stop being misogynists even for just the * one * thread you have to appear like you care about women . 
  no , they just want to disassociate themselves from people like you . 
   has n't necessarily to do anything with romanticism . 
  conscription in germany always was centered around the idea of the citizen in uniform , the idea being to keep checks and balances in the military and to stop it from either developing a mind of its own or it devolving into a group of paid mercenaries . 
  of course , i absolutely agree with that . 
  i am not sure myself i want the conscription in greece abolished , for the same reasons . 
  the post-french revolution concept of the popular army undoubtedly played a progressive role in history and empowered the masses . 
  i am just not sure about its validity in the present era . 
  i am not sure about sweden but in southern europe the red star is far from a fringe symbol . 
  it even appears in the [ emblem of the italian republic ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/emblem_of_italy#/media/file:emblem_of_italy.svg ) . 
   i honestly thought that was considered an archaic idea nowadays . 
  to be fair , the concept of the popular army was revolutionary and progressive when it was introduced in the napoleonic period . 
  but after the two world wars and then vietnam things have changed . 
  maybe that 's because your country skipped all the modern industrialised wars . 
  ww1 and ww2 pretty much destroyed any romantic notion of warfare . 
  edit : this was n't meant as an insult . 
  not even banter in typical / r/europe fashion ( `` the always neutral swedes/swiss/etc '' ) . 
  what i meant was that military conscription is despised by most people today because of the collective trauma caused by the world wars , or vietnam in the case of the us . 
  it was speculation , if i am wrong and sweden 's alleged support for conscription is due to other reasons , i apologise . 
  south korea was a de facto dictatorship until 1987 . 
  and was given special attention by the us because of its geopolitical importance . 
  not exactly a typical example of a post-colonial country . 
  better than exporting genocidal maniacs . 
  edit : / s, 
   imagine if britain acted like this towards ireland not sure if joking or serious ... 
   well , i think hitler 's germany was an effective government . 
  the nazi economy was only close to prosperous during the early war years because of all the loot they were getting from the countries they had conquered . 
  it was unsustainable and pretty soon the allies out-produced germany by a mile . 
  there are threads in / r/askhistorians debunking the `` nazi economic miracle '' but i am too lazy to search for them . 
   it was ( almost ) successful in producing the intended results by its creators . 
  no , they were n't even close to winning the war . 
  their strategic goal of beating the ussr was lost as early as december 1941 . 
  after moscow and pearl harbour they had no chance . 
  thankfully the german economy was n't efficient at all in wartime production . 
   although turkey and greece are antagonistic towards each-other they 're fundamentally allies , pledged to defend the national sovereignty of one-another . 
  \u0399t 's actually the opposite . 
  i am a staunch advocate for greco-turkish friendship and cooperation but nato is n't the vehicle for that . 
  nato did n't give a flying fuck about cyprus in 1974 because ultimately the `` communist '' president makarios was removed and that 's all they cared about . 
  goddamn did you have to make me hate myself 20 mins before new year 's ? 
   you should be well aware plenty of people do n't like albanians or bosnian muslims as well . 
  if you 're talking about greece , some people here used to not like albanians and bosnians for other reasons , mainly because of immigration and `` support for the serbian bros '' . 
   there are plenty of brown people in europe such as christian arabs , punjabis , indians etc , yet nobody really pays them any mind because they do n't cause problems like muslims do plenty of sikhs and indians have been harassed in the us and the uk just because they are dark-skinned and thus `` look muslim '' . 
   also , https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/adam_michnik ;-) i am waiting for the punch line here . . 
  good . 
  the mods are way lenient with all the reuropean shit in this sub . 
  it 's racism . 
  they hate them because they are brown . 
  nobody would be this outraged if they were bosnians or albanians . 
  in fact , nobody had any problem with the west supporting bosnian and albanian muslims the last 20 years . 
  as a serb you should be aware of how the west views white and brown muslims differently . 
  the salt is so much that if you threw it inside a pool you 'd walk on the water like jesus . 
  thankfully !, 
  first time i 've heard it . 
  usually it 's jokingly called grauniad because they make a lot of typos , which is actually true . 
  that 's correct afaik . 
   retardian lol . 
  you people do n't even try anymore . 
  why do n't you fuck off to voat or some other internet shithole ? 
  or is reddit your precious safe space where you can freely spit hate ? 
  if you believe the media have a pro-immigration bias the joke 's on you . 
  9 out of 10 articles that get posted here are anti-immigration and they all come from mainstream media . 
  how ignorant are you ? 
  take a look at the fucking map of the region . 
  i hope they put all the reddit armchair critics like you on the plane to syria , you 'd shit your pants even before you landed there . 
  reddit complains when they do n't drink alcohol and are conservative , reddit complains when they do drink alcohol and try to assimilate . 
  these people ca n't win . 
  for some words linguists are sure they are n't ie , for others it 's not certain . 
  weather forecast says it 's going to snow in athens :d, 
  the vietnamese like everyone . 
  and contrary to other ( ex ? ), 
  socialist countries almost everyone likes them . 
   the soviet union being arguably worse than the nazis after defeating them . 
  except they were n't . 
  there was a clear plan for death by starvation for the eastern european population if the nazis won and they 'd probably also use the death camps , since they already had them in place . 
   besides , the allies won wwii , the soviet union made the greatest sacrifice but would have lost without the western allies . 
  the opposite is also true , the western allies could never beat nazi germany without the ussr . 
  and spare me the `` sacrifice '' bs , they straight up * beat * germany in the eastern front . 
   flair : earth lol, 
  wait , do n't you people also say that poland is homogeneous * because * of the soviet occupation ? 
  so it was bad but also good ? 
  it 's hard keeping track of the mental gymnastics here . 
  you are downvoted because this thread is reuropean . 
  stormfront used to be the boogeyman but it ai n't got shit on reddit right now . 
   every year she tries to make hellfest forbidden . 
  so a typical case of `` i want free speech in order to insult minorities , but i am against free speech when * i * feel offended '' . 
  she could be a redditor . 
  indeed not all of them are turkish . 
  funnily , it was the greek state and nationalists who alienated them from greece and pushed them into turkey 's arms . 
  if you keep telling them they 're turks and treat them like shit , no wonder they 're gon na turn to turkey for help . 
  to add to that , this was a `` free '' vote , there were no strict party lines and whips . 
  they could 've easily voted against and nobody would care . 
  the point is that blood money does n't apply here . 
  if these black south african students were benefiting from rhodes ' money at the same time he was enslaving and exploiting their countrymen i could see it , but this case is no different than people taking money that belonged to their country in the first place . 
  the former greek monarchy is universally despised in greece , but if i lived close to the king 's abandoned estate in athens you bet i 'd take my dog for a walk there . 
  this shit was built with greek public resources and labour and it belongs to the greek people . 
  that 's not how it works . 
  otherwise all the third world dictators would be allowed to emigrate with all their dirty money and there would be no sanctions . 
  next time the dj refuses to play my favourite song i am going to write a letter to the daily mail . 
  it 's political correctness gone mad !,

  what do you see ? 
  the italian and the green study the photograph carefully , and responded : two cables !, 
  exactly , do you know what that means ? 
  asked the egyptian . 
  no , the others replied . 
  it means that the ancient egyptians had invented the telephone !, 
  unimpressed the greek reaches for his bag , and produces a photograph of his own . 
  wait till you see this , he claimed . 
  this was found below the parthenon . 
  what do you see ? 
  the italian and the egyptian studied the photograph long and hard . 
  they brought it to the light , they stuck their faces on the photograph , used a magnifying glass ... after a while they responded resigned : nothing , we see nothing '' . 
  exactly , shouted the greek . 
  do you know what that means ? 
  the italian and the egyptian looked at each other and replied in unison ... no . 
  it means that the ancient greeks had invented the cellphone !, 
  wanted to order something from czech , item cost $ 45 , shipping cost $ 35 . 
  shipping costs for the same item from czech to portugal was $ 6.5 , even though it 's almost double the distance . 
  it has to do with the laws and how costly it is for the logistics/mail companies to do business . 
  european stores do n't use their country 's national post for various reasons . 
  chinese / korean stores however do , and it 's very cheap , especially for small sized stuff . 
  ebay and amazon is okey-ish , as vendors use the cheapest available postage . 
  online shops however who use dhl , fedex etc , it 's cost prohibitive . 
  make the declaration of boats over a specific size mandatory . 
  force the naval yards to implement a registration number on the hull of the vessel similar to the vin on a car . 
  give incentives to other countries ( turkey / libya etc ) to adopt said laws . 
  institute harsher laws against people who profit from transporting refugees and treat them as human smugglers . 
  create a pan-european immigration police ( think interpol but for immigration ) to handle those matters . 
  give incentives to other countries ( turkey / libya etc ) to adopt said laws . 
  appoint vessels from all countries on patrol duties on high traffic areas ( southern med/easter aegean etc ) . 
  that always in conjunction with the country who 's national waters they will be operating on . 
  create refugee receiving centers ( / w humane conditions ) in key positions with easily accessible and cheap transportation to and from eu countries and deportation countries . 
  4-5 c130 can do the job . 
  said key positions need not only be on european soil but friendly to eu countries near/on the immigration path/countries of origin . 
  in aforementioned centers create an `` adjustment '' agency . 
  make a mandatory 1 month duration program , which will be used to screen immigrants in order to better assign them to places of settlement and to weed out trouble elements . 
  give incentives to immigrants to have some form of identification and to voluntarily go to said centers . 
  spread that information to countries of origin . 
  converge the immigration benefits on all eu countries as much as possible and always taking into account the cost of living on each country . 
  make countries no more or less desirable as targets of immigration unless there is actual need for it . 
  accrue diplomatic - and not military - power on troubled regions to help form a solution . 
  put the intelligence services to good use for once . 
  embargo the weapon and ammunition sales on troubled regions . 
  education is the key . 
  educated people are less prone to sectarianism . 
  ----- so 3-prong solution to all three facets of the problem . 
  solve the cause of the problem , stop the means that facilitate the problem and fight the after effects . 
  the investigations are not handled by judges , but by prosecutors . 
  she is a judge of the high court of greece . 
  their duty is to examine and cancel if need be decisions on issues made by lesser courts as it pertains to the current legislation . 
  they do not handle `` corruption cases '' . 
  you do n't need to act as a temporary pm to color your opinion or make friends with politicians . 
  the door is that way - , 
  [ the music ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dkgta30tzn8 ) man ... goosebumps . 
  +1 for the movie as well . 
   i fucking love dakos , though i go with mizitra over feta . 
  yeah , preference thing really . 
  i like mizithra as well , but for mixing it with other foods/recipes , i prefer feta . 
  mizithra is more of a [ stand-alone cheese ] ( http://www.bwdavis.ca/uploads/2/9/3/4/2934170/8479627_orig.jpg?80 ) for me . 
  i 'm from crete and we make our own olive oil . 
  we consume a lot of the stuff , we have a [ 150lt tote ] ( http://www.olillopart.cat/wp-content/uploads/ibc-oliveoil1.jpg ) under a staircase which we refill every year . 
  one year our trees needed trimming or what-it 's - called so the crop was minimal , and due to some miscommunication we run out of oil for a month . 
  well , you know the saying about taking stuff for granted . 
  we used store bought for a couple of days . . yeah , we resorted to ordering from outside . 
  example : we have a snack , [ barley rusk + tomatoes + feta + oregano ] ( https://greekaura.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/dakos.jpg ) and as with all our dishes , olive oil ( if you can find the [ rusk ] ( http://www.veterano.gr/portals/0/templates/rusk1.jpg ) - the rest are pretty easy , ** try it ** , you 'll thank me ) . 
  typically we drown that stuff in olive oil and it 's delicious . 
  it 's not cloying , you do n't feel satiated by the oil . 
  well , with ** our ** oil that is . 
  with the store bought , even with way less that we were used to , we could n't eat the thing . 
  after a couple of bites we felt `` full '' . 
  and never mind the smell . 
  ----- anyway , if you 're really interested in the culinary arts or you simply enjoy using olive oil in your dishes , i suggest finding a couple of friends and making a `` mass '' order from a local . 
  how much do you pay for your olive oil ? 
  $ 10 for that shitty little .5 lt container ? 
  you can get it for $ 3-5 straight from the source . 
  a parcel of 50x50x50 and 100kg would cost around $ 250 shipment , so you 'll get aaa oil for less than half . 
  taboos are societal structures . 
  natives in various parts of the world that do not have such prohibitions grow up just fine . 
  how many years ago was it that women could n't even bathe using anything other than full coveralls ? 
  it 's just customs . 
  some get discarded while new ones get adopted . 
  nah , we do call it ornithorhynchos ( chicken/bird-beak ) as well , but platypodas is more widely used as it 's easier to spell . 
  plus it 's a funnier and cutter name . 
  the known dude 's beard ( last image ) is more well kept that the model you 're referring too . 
  while at the same time being more curly thus harder to keep . 
  $ 85 billion bro . 
  ca n't be more pro than that . 
  greece , the others are amateurs where debt is concerned . 
  there 's so much stuff going on in europe presently , that i have n't bothered getting myself informed with what 's happening in the other side of the atlantic . 
  so , i am ashamed to say , i have no knowledge of sanders nor what is happening with the nominations of the parties there . 
  well , the definition of `` informed '' is pretty ... subjective . 
  i can accept that not all ( or not even most ) advocates of a grexit are bild readers , but how many of them have an actual understanding of the situation ? 
  how can you even measure that ? 
  our flag has a white cross on blue on the top left , representing orthodoxy . 
  it has 9 stripes , 5 blue 4 white alternating . 
  the number of stripes represent the saying '' ** freedom or death ** '' , with the 5 blue stripes representing the number of syllables in the word `` freedom '' , the 4 white the number of syllables in `` or death '' ( obviously in the greek language ) . 
  the history of the color selection is pretty muddy , goes from the simple `` resembles the sea and sky '' to the color of achilles ' shield . 
  well mussolini 's army had tanks and our most modern aircraft - the pzl p. 24 was no match in most parts for the italian g. 50s and mc .200 . 
  plus we did n't have any bombers . 
  strategy was not our saving grace either - as it was later proved that leaving our bulgarian borders mostly unguarded allowed germany to speedily invade without much resistance .

  i do n't give a rat 's arse about queues but a lie is a lie and a liar caught and yet keep on pretending is a sad fuck . 
  i got mad cause you are saying lies . 
  stupid lies !, 
  where the fuck do you live and have n't seen any queues . 
  a complete reverse of reality and you are asking me if i have an agenta ?!, 
  honestly i dunno know . 
  what i know is that tsipras fucked everything up royally !, 
  i got a 3 room bungalow , with pool 20 meters from the beach . 
  price 1 trillion new drachmas ( about 2.75 euros ), 
  where the fuck do you live and did n't witness it ? 
  little greece in astoria ny ? 
  i 've seen only long queues . 
  longer than ever . 
  10s of people waiting in front of the atm . 
  fuck you and your `` lets bend reality a bit '' lies . 
  they are !, 
  longer queues than i 've ever seen . 
  people are calm , but they are there . 
  / r/vitge is just telling crap . 
   the atm queues are not longer than usual on a saturday morning . 
  what are you talking ' about ? 
  is `` usual '' for people rushing in the night to the atms ? 
  for the 1st time ever , i 've seen queues longer that 50 people in front of an atm this morning . 
  cut the crap !, 
  kke is a fucking stalinist party that is declining fast . 
  cant wait to see them disappear . 
  please answer me this : - i can examine the consequences on what is going to happen if i vote `` yes '' for the deal . 
  - how can i examine the consequences on what is going to happen if i vote `` no '' for the deal ? 
  i believe so too ... 
  it certainly is terra incognita, 
  so will they tell people that in the case of the proposals being rejected that the country will still be able to keep the euro ? 
  ious can be used then . 
  the introduction of a new currency would take months . 
  edit . 
  i have n't got the slightest idea . 
  i just read that somewhere . 
  you 're probably right . 
  i find this more proper for the occasion . 
  it 's in english too . 
  not really . 
  technically you can default within ez . 
  then come and take greek citizenship mate !, 
  true, 
  they were also elected on the promise of keeping the euro . 
  how on earth the average joe will be able to be truly informed and decide in 7 days ? 
  i can understand that some may find this a good deal . 
  unfortunately many believe that old cliche `` the enemy of my enemy is doing me favors '' . 
  well be careful what you wish for cause isis is nothing to be compared with russians . 
  even the slightest advancement ( anywhere on the globe ) of isis should deeply trouble you . 
  if it doesnt well , too bad . 
  i ca n't help you with that . 
  tell what to ukrainians ? 
  we are talking about fucking isis . 
  they are enemies of everyone russians , ukrainians , americans you name it !, 
  all human lives are . 
  are they yet ? 
  no war 's started as far as i know . 
  why should i ? 
  why do you say that ? 
  no fighting between nato and russia ever started . 
  we would know by the mushroom clouds outside our windows . 
  anyway ... 
  they we - nato - should join and help them wipe this monstrosity off the face of this planet . 
  russian lives are n't cheaper than ours . 
  what an awful and dumb thing to say ... isis is everyone 's problem and nothing about them expanding their operations is good news . 
  how fucking dumb !, 
  yes it is trust worthy, 
  the message was so obviously overblown that it was certain for the experiment to be successful . 
  how about an experiment that would notice racist innuendos and soft reactions ? 
  seriously we do n't . 
  it 's because the numbers are so great many succeed to go through the net . 
  i can fully agree on the fact that eu solidarity is a joke and a farce . 
  but then again if it is ... why should the southerners play by the book and do n't let them to go where the wanted to go in the 1st place : north ? 
  cause of solidarity and fairness ? 
  such enormous hypocrisy is all too common in the eu . 
  what a one sided view on the matter . 
  so it is only what was part of the initial agreements that should be done ? 
  then how on earth many eu coutnries ask for pan european sanctions against russia ? 
  your country included . 
  was that too part of the initial agreements ? 
  oh and yes italy joined those sanctions even though they are hurtful for them and even though they face no danger from the russians whatsoever . 
  wow mate !, 
  what a great view on the matter . 
  if most europe wants that , then they should cut the crap and start helping . 
  the amount of people entering the southern countries is overwelming . 
  there 's simply no time to process them to see who is entitled of asylum and who is not . 
  so there enter the eu organizations and start blaming the southerners of violating human rights for taking so long . 
  then there is the impossible task to send them back . 
  one common problem lets say with the pakistani immigrants is that although they do n't come from a war zone none of them have papers , their embassies in europe deny to provide them with new and does n't not accept them back . 
  where 's the eu solidarity to tackle this problem ? 
  a - la russia sanctions against those countries that behave like that ? 
  nonsense and hypocrisy of the highest order . 
   why on earth would they attack a factory ? 
  simples : anything western is a legitimate target . 
  amen brother !, 
  i fully agree on that . 
  edit : just a few pointers . 
  what i find absurd is that while tax evasion is always mentioned as a big contributor to the problem , it was never a subject of the negotiations . 
  not only any mention bout that is immediately denied by the troika ( cause as they say it wo n't bring immediate income ) but it is also forbidden to the greek government to act on itself . 
  it looks surreal but it is true .

  it is also expressly forbidden in the turkish constitution . 
  '' / r/europe pushes for re-election of merkel . 
  germans bow their heads in defeat and comply '', 
  i honestly do n't see the obvious . 
  why is it a basic human right of people to enter whichever country they want ? 
  what are borders about then ? 
  or do you mean something else ? 
  let me interject here that they are n't coming to europe asking for protection : they had that as soon as they entered turkey . 
  they are just looking for better prospects . 
  they are of course misinformed , mistreated and goaded on by erdogan 's regime , to be used as pawns in his political games , but that does n't change the fact that they are n't refuges when they try to enter the eu - although it does make it clearer that the ethical burden is on erdogan , not tsipras , orban or merkel . 
  more to this point , they are n't even content to stay in greece to begin with ( let alone when they realize we ca n't even afford them humane living conditions ) . 
  they want to go find the best welfare and the best salaries and the most beautiful women in the eu . 
  not even pretending to be refugees . 
  i have n't read the geneva convention , but i 'd be surprised if it obliges countries to stop enforcing their external borders and accept anyone who wants in , just because the grass is greener there ... 
  maybe they have n't had their morning coffee yet ? 
  i need a mug and 20 minutes to actually wake up - i might be walking around before that , but it 's on autopilot . 
  i 'm sure the driver could be a giraffe and it still would n't register . 
  i 'd just say my `` g ` morning '' and go have a seat . 
  i think he 's all but finished grabbing political power . 
  maybe he 'll go full inadvertent self-satire in the near future . 
  `` supreme theologician president admiral general ~ ~ aladeen ~ ~ erdogan '', 
  stranger , you and your people make internet beautiful . 
  this would be very awesome if you had no relation to turkey : * paraguaian granddad in asunci\u00f3n * : `` turkey 's government is controlling our weather i tell you ! '', 
  birds do n't have governments ! '', 
  with names like these i 'd expect them to rule for 1000 years each and then leave office on the back of a dragon . 
  it really depends on the country . 
  since you are interested in balkan religious `` cross-pollination '' , here is another bit : orthodox christianity still retains elements of ancient greek rituals , almost 2000 years later . 
  [ example ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/koliva ), 
  welcome to the dizzying complexity of political integration of a continent , ie . 
  like in most political decisions , there are no correct answers here . 
  only less wrong ones . 
   cheap rerigeratos this hit a nerve . 
  i have a cheap stove made in turkey , damn thing works well until it heats up too much and stuff start melting . 
  which , you know , is part of the job description of a stove . 
  i passionately hate my stove . 
  also , i do n't know if turkey has a general issue with production standards . 
  i just wanted to rant about my stove . 
  turkey and greece do n't even agree on where the sea borders are . 
  the turkish parliament voted in '96 ( iirc , cba to search it ) that a unilateral declaration by greece would constitute casus belli . 
  when someone puts himself in a situation where he can drown to force a moral conflict , does this still stand ? 
  how `` decent '' is it if people are allowed to extort a state to meet their demands by self-harming ? 
  i am not implying that the answers to these questions are obvious . 
  morality is full of gray areas . 
  i 'm glad it 's not my job to make these decisions . 
  edit : just adding here that what i 'm saying is from an ethical standpoint , because you brought it up . 
  from the perspective of international law i understand things are very clear : you are obliged to help . 
  little did they know that this was how the 1st eestiriik would begin ... 
  at least for greece , the main problem is the [ huge sea border ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/aegean_dispute ) . 
  the attacks against alevis by erdogan loyalists were widely reported by western media . 
  their beliefs and allegiances ... less so . 
  i can tell they are up to no good . 
  they are quiet . 
  too quiet ... ( also , / r/polandball needs more estonia ), 
  scale matters , though . 
  which is an awesome plane . 
  they could [ stop in mid-air ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4tb0k1jbc0 ) , open the door and have a few chaps chuck the bomb off the plane . 
  i do n't think they 'd ever manage to get away from the blast , but looking cool has never been about safety anyway . 
  it 's ok , magic 8-ball . 
  you did your best . 
  thanks for the empathy and the good words , just bear in mind that text does n't convey how thick my accent is . 
   there is real danger of having a lost generation in greece . 
  i see people my age , who would probably have had children at school by now if they could , struggling to afford a place of their own . 
  so when you see greeks in your countries , bear in mind that most are just looking to make an honest living somewhere where hard work counts for something . 
  they are not after your benefits or anything sinister . 
  i 'd been in talks for a position in england , i was all but hired , then the brexit vote happened . 
  now i will probably have an answer by september , when the higher ups have assessed the new situation there . 
  i 'm not as hopeful though . 
  i 've also been learning german to give myself more options . 
  we 'll see how this goes . 
  i ca n't live off that . 
  the numbers just do n't add up . 
  i used to live on my own for over a decade , but i had to move back in with my parents at 34 to make ends meet ( i am 37 now ) . 
  i ca n't overstate how dispiriting this is . 
  a portion of that income now goes to a therapist and antidepressants , but at least i 'm not adding to the suicide statistics . 
  yay ? 
  my circumstances are not special . 
  i personally know many people who are in this situation or worse , but this is probably the kind of thing that falls between the cracks of statistics . 
  not easy to measure unregistered jobs . 
  i guess this is the reduction of wages in registered employment . 
  there has been a huge surge in unregistered employment though , and there all bets are off . 
  for example , i work for 350e/month as a full time specialist ( programmer ) because otherwise i 'd be unemployed . 
  this is represents a 70 % reduction in my wages since 2010 . 
  this is so funny because it 's so relatable to anyone who uses mnemonic devices a lot . 
  the article clearly does n't have a political agenda and this comment is clearly not sarcastic . 
  i read your post and i still ca n't understand what i 'm seeing . 
  it 's like my brain completely shuts off when confronted with this image . 
  extra info : haf is about the same size with the turkish air force , as it is considered the main potential adversary in the area and there are several ongoing border disputes . 
  it mainly flies f-16 , mirage 2000 , and some f-4e phantom combat aircraft . 
  there are almost daily interceptions and dogfights with turkish military aircraft that fly into what greece considers ( and turkey disputes as ) its airspace . 
  the dogfights usually end with live ammunition weapons lock , but so far there have only been very few instances of shots fired . 
  accidents do happen from time to time though , and people and equipment have been lost on both sides . 
  the turkish parliament officially declared in 1995 that if greece ever tries to claim the parts of the aegean allowed by the un law of the sea ( 12nm vs the current 6nm ) it will automatically be considered casus belli ( cause of war ) . 
  even in 2015 , in virtual bankruptcy , greece was 7th in the world in per capita military expenditure . 
  this is a huge drain for the economy but considered necessary because of the volatile geopolitics of the area . 
  i mean no disrespect to the turks of / r/europe or in general , and i hope i wrote this neutrally enough to avoid arguments . 
  just wanted / u/drury to know that haf is not only cool in name . 
  also , no need for money dear slovak-bros , we 've been running f-16s on ouzo for a while now and it seems to be going ok . 
  it even leaves a nice aniseed aftertaste on the afterburners . 
  i do n't think anyone in greece wants instability in turkey . 
  it adds volatility to a much larger neighbour with which we have border disputes , and now an issue with 8 fugitives .

  the turkish and jewish quarters were unscathed .

  on a more positive note , the more this orange gibbon ruins the republican party that still ( somehow ) supports him , the more likely it is for democrats to slay in the 2018 representative and senate elections and finally get the majority they need to get something positive done .

  * i agree with you , but if the greek quarter had n't been burnt down in 1922 , the ` greek vibe ' would be stronger . 
   i do n't think you have anymore muslims we do , actually . 
  western thrace ( especially rhodope and xanthi ) have thousands of muslims ( turks and pomaks ) from before the independence wars .

  where i worked , there were almost exclusively germans , russians , and tourists from balkan states ( mostly bulgaria and serbia ) . 
  among them , some of the russians would be the worst , but the vast majority would still be very nice . 
  balkanites would be the cheapest and less likely to spend money , which makes sense considering they come from poorer countries ( the russians we 'd have would be at least upper middle class by russian standards ) . 
  we had almost no other nationalities where i worked , but i 've heard from several co-workers in other hotels around the country that the british are usually the worst of the bunch . 
  especially groups of 20-somethings that get horribly drunk and stupid 24/7 . 
  families and older individuals tend to be much more decent , though . 
  yes , but vaporland has a worse healthcare and education system than iceland . 
  having worked at a hotel with about 40 % german tourists , i can easily say that germans are among the nicest and most cooperative of tourists . 
  that being said , there were n't any substantial cases of bad blood between the two nations . 
  tourism from germany has only been going up since the crisis hit . 
  oddest thing about it is that the state ( originally territory ) of washington was at first going to be named * columbia * , named after the columbia river flowing through the state . 
  however , the government was afraid people might confuse it with d.c. ( district of columbia ) . 
  so they named it * washington * , which cleared out things nicely . 
  all civil protests against an abusive government , yes . 
   ** in ankara : ** * small crowds outside the university in the turkish capital chanted slogans against the ruling ak party , including `` akp will be held accountable '' and `` shoulder to shoulder against fascism '' , while brawls erupted as police forced people away from the campus entrances . 
  *  ** in kiev : ** * by 25 january 2014 , the protests ( of euromaidan ) had been fueled by the perception of `` widespread government corruption , '' `` abuse of power , '' and `` violation of human rights in ukraine . 
  '' * they seem pretty comparable to me . 
  i think raygun made a comparison to [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/euromaidan ) . 
  simple and snarky is definitely the way to go . 
  maybe not in the following 4 or 5 years , but not even the most provident economists can be certain of brexit 's toll on the uk 's economy and how this will or wo n't be used for political purposes . 
  if the scots see the uk failing them and the eu becoming increasingly more endearing as an alternative , they could choose to leave the kingdom in 10 or 20 years from now . 
   * erdogan says the reform will provide stability at a time of turmoil and prevent a return to the fragile coalitions of the past .

  this man is a vile human being , even for a politician . 
  i agree that they 're not comparable , but / u/swamp _ thingie 's point still stands . 
  geopolitics change over time and no country is set or fixed for eternity .

  i really like the bottled up anger , barely contained inside a courteous and well-spoken exterior . 
  it 's so british !, 
   people start to worship athletes , actors , singers , and other famous people who then use their fame in the political arena . 
  not that i disagree , but this did n't start with democracy . 
  it 's been going on since time immemorial . 
  it has more to do with human society and culture than the political system of a country .

  favourite story about liechtenstein is the one about their last military expedition during the austro-prussian war in 1866 . 
  none of the 80 soldiers sent were injured or killed . 
  on the contrary , 80 soldiers left the country , but 81 returned . 
  the unit came back with a new italian friend . 
  [ here . 
  there is an annotation about that on the bottom left of the map . 
  that 's * quenya * , though . 
  it 's the old language of the elves akin to latin in our real world . 
  the language we know most about and hear in the lotr movies is * sindarin * , which is primarily based on welsh and other celtic languages . 
  it was practically yesterday !, 
  italy seriously needs to take a chill pill and stop being this gorgeous . 
  it 's making the rest of us uncomfortable . 
  i 'm sure the tourists feel safe . 
  uzung\u00f6l is a lovely place . 
  the village is one of the dozen or so than were fully coverted to islam during the 17th century .

  the vast majority of commercial goods sold are imports , with drachma you are about to have an exceptional expensive product spike which the local production mind you is non-existant . 
  also oil taxes in greece are possibly one of the highest forms of income for the state ( exactly why we have so expensive gazoline , huge tax on it , also the state owns a big chunk of one of the 2 major companies ), 
  ok good luck building an industry with no capital , good luck exporting anything ( remember our biggest export is refined oil products with a 8billion deficit of crude oil imports ) . 
  so easy to go to drachma , zero internal industry , zero capital to build that industry , expensive imports and non-existing exports . 
  great times . 
  reality shows kinda died out in greece the last 5 years . 
  i mean compared to your average reality shows it would propably be far more educational . 
  we have a pretty good army , for a while we were no3 in nato spending % gdp ( one of the many reasons of our mess today ) to call us trojan horse for russian relations is kinda extreme , greece has maintained good relations with russia for centuries . 
  for us at least its supposed to guarantee that the first party would be able to form stable majority governments , in reality it leads to situations of 151 + governments even though they only recieved 30-36 % of the votes . 
  i mean if they have the nationality many countries allow for it . 
  i can vote for the french elections at the french embassy even though i was born in greece but thanks to my mother i have dual nationality and citizenship . 
  i think there is some hilarious examples in the us , expatriots can vote for presidential elections but some non-incorporated citizens cant . 
  i think one of the biggest issues i read , is that turkey has a similar bonus seats electoral system like greece . 
  in greece for a party to get into the parliament they need at least 3 % nationwide , else the first party gets their seats . 
  in turkey ( turks redditors , please correct if wrong ) , a party must get at least 10 % !, 
  in order to gain access to the parliament . 
  i dont wish to be that guy , but per reddit guidelines , he just used the article title . 
  if he had edited in any way , it could have been said of inserting his personal opinion and the whole post be removed . 
  maybe its for visual reasons ? 
  it seems to be more clear on the white/blue fond, 
  polygon is so crap . 
  and witcher , a game that deals so good with racial discrimination ( dwarfs/elf pogroms ) . 
  clickbaiting as usual . 
  well it took almost 200.000 and 400 ships last time . 
  dogs and cats on cities yes . 
  and a huge pigeon crap factory ( rip cars ) not sterilizing the dogs roaming athens ( merely collecting em for a month in 2004 for the olympics ) plus owners abandoning dogs when they move/dont care/not cute enough , the lack of a proper humane organisation and a law frame concerning animal abuse . 
  these are many reasons athens mostly has so many stray dogs . 
  but feral animals ? 
  i mean you might see bears on north greece because some brilliant asswipe built a highway on top the bear paths with no alternate routes for them , but on cities ? 
  thats a bit extreme to call the stray populations feral . 
  unless you mean the 300 feral animals at the centre of the city , they are a special kind of animals . 
  tax revenue for the state , less police spending on drug enforcement , less strain on the prison system . 
  greece has possibly the highest taxes on oil refineries and gazoline . 
  the trade deficit , comes from the fact we dont produce enough crude oil . 
  the couple sources of crude oil production are miniscule to our needs . 
  we import 18billion dollar worth of crude oil . 
  and export 12 billion dollar worth of refined oil products . 
  so you would import crude oil in expensive dollar prices , consume for internal use and then hope to still be competitive for exports ? 
  in case of failure , imagine all the divisions stationed in the west would have been able to turn east on the russian front and south on the italian front and possibly delay or even turn the tide long enough that we would see us forced to use atom bombs in germany . 
  or pan-am flights to the moon . 
  in 30 years it will be , railguns , microfusion engines and energised armor . 
  i have posted it before and i will say it again , going to drachma is suicide . 
  our main exports are refined oil products , which are aquired with a serious trade deficit . 
  we have no major industrial infrastructure to create a cheap alternative for the inevitable expensive imports of all major goods . 
  we have no capital to create said industry . 
  tourism hard currency income wont be enough to balance the mess in all other aspects of our economy . 
  and at the same article he says that an agreement is ever close ( which we hear the last 2 months but whatever ) time is running out , i feel our government wasted precious months and only started actual negociation the last 2 weeks . 
  the angle of the picture isnt showing it , but the body frontal armor is sloped . 
  dont bother with him , he is a one day troll . 
  \u039f\u03bb\u03bb\u03b1\u03bd\u03b4\u03af\u03b1 hollandia essentially . 
  in greece unfortunately politics is often getting into the government for the sake of it . 
  even on the verge of the abyss . 
  but as you said , they were elected on the promise of staying at the eurozone , they wont get the same results on a new election if they abandon the eurozone road . 
  its more like that a small portion of syriza wont accept the terms and since the government maintains a tight majority it could lead to elections . 
  ironic that much of the capital used in the creation and aquisition of these islamic bank branches ( essentially 0 interest banks ) , was procured through international lending which obviously has interest . 
  interesting article nontheless , its always interesting to read the implications of islamization on the financial sector . 
  iron merkel . 
  if ww3 were to break out , i imagine merkel atop a leopard in full medieval plate armor . 
  i think the recent developments are about to reveal an abyss of corruption and greed . 
  we always knew fifa had something rotten inside , we just didnt know the extent of the problem . 
  another glorious fine for a glorious bank whose entire histrory has been dipped into money laundering and its humble beginnings have deep roots to the opium trading on china . 
  a shining example of modern banking institutions , 200 years of greed and corruption . 
  you should also see that myconos , one of the most expensive tourist destinations in the world , gets the reduced vat ... madness, 
  tbh our creditors will never accept a decrease on vat so the whole discussion is academic , in fact its more likely they demand a unified vat for all services and products at 23 % . 
  but you can also make a fortune . 
  i think its in japan that they have begun filtering the sewage networks for precious metals , the amounts of gold they take is simply incredible . 
  so yeah we also shit gold . 
  you do realize food is on the higher 23 % echelon right ? 
  its a nice round number and it doesnt create a mess of accounting of having 5 different vat values . 
  at 15 % you will refuce tax evasion and general prices , favoring both internal market and your tourist prospects . 
  it has always been like that ( personally i am in favor of a unified 15 % vat for everything ), 
  the left platform is split into further smaller groups of crazy . 
  there are times i wonder how that party keeps itself together , as long as they follow the party line and vote when needed , we might avoid early elections . 
  its a very small faction though even if on other subreddit you claim otherwise . 
  i dont get what you saying , all the listed countries ( and many smaller ones ) have exceptional armament industries , germany produces leopards , france has an incredible aviaton industry . 
  now i will give you the point that coordinating all that production to a common standard equipment would be a more difficult task . 
  however a good example of civil cooperation between industies is obviously airbus . 
  if it can be done for civilian purposes ( to the point that boeing has a huge competitor ) it can certainly be done for military purposes . 
  good . 
  using an image containing ingredients your product doesnt contain should always be considered false advertisment . 
  this has me really worried , the cohesion of syriza was already questionable , last thing we need , on the brink of bankrupcy are new elections . 
  non stability right before the peak tourist period isnt really great . 
  well one wanted to be caliph in the place of the caliph , this one aims for the sultanate . 
  why do people have such prejudice against horse meat , if its proper ( no drugs , old age etc ) , its very tastefull . 
  thats all we hear for like months , some tangible results wouldnt be bad . 
  there might not be one , but if need arises europe can create very fast a strong military . 
  industry wise , german , french , italian and uk armaments industries are exceptional strong . 
  what i would like to see is a federal defense force , nothing too major , just a battalion from each country member . 
  but that nucleus could be used to form larger formations if an emergency arises . 
  but then the question arises , that federal force , what is its mission , what would happen if member states interests collide ? 
  i dont think anyone wants to imagine the potential crash . 
  but first greece has always been part of the balkans , its part of our culture and our history , i dont think anyone has ever claimed otherwise . 
  to say that people wont care is a big exagarattion , at 25 % unemployment and more than 50 % on the under 30 's , people care . 
  i dont have answers to your post , i believe and hope that we will not make a collossal mistake but i am not cassandra , i already live in fear that i am not have job in the coming months and have explored the chance of living abroad . 
  getting worked up on internet comments is the least i need . 
  and yet some manage to get under my skin . 
  there doesnt seem to be an easy way out , if i have to choose between more austerity or a potential unknown catastrophic economical event , the choice is obvious for me . 
  the current bet is , if the government can convince our creditors to be slightly more lenient on certain aspects of the measures . 
  other than that , i know that for the next 30 years we have a nearly unsustainable debt and record unemployment rates . 
  i honestly dont see a way out , especially with the current greek infrastructure , even argentina , which is btw a gigantic exporter in contrast to us , is still struggling on many aspects .

  and i am happy to see that you are doing your best to hide this dark reality from everyone else . 
  germany 's law , on the other hand , is very different both in scope and intent :  ( 1 ) whoever publicly or by dissemination of writings ( \u00a7 11 par . 
  3 ) defames , in a manner suitable to disturb the public peace , the substance of the religious or world view conviction of others , shall be fined or imprisoned for up to three years major differences are that it protects ** worldviews ** and ** convictions ** , also that it is concerned with ** public peace ** and defamation , concepts that can be applied to secularism and a secular society . 
  the greek law is concerned with magical beings being offended - public peace is totally irrelevant . 
  finally , why are you guys obsessed with whataboutism ? 
  even if the germans had the same law ( which they do n't , as i explained above ) would that be a serious argument ? 
  * but but but the germans are doing it too !? 
  * you realize that if the germans do something stupid , we do not obliged to follow suit ? 
   especially since , yes , we 're getting rid of this law . 
  because everyone agrees it 's dumb . 
  we are not . 
  a disturbing amount of people support such laws . 
  and most of them , as evidenced by the internet , start their arguments by `` as an atheist ... '' . 
   err yes , ` ethnicities ' are subjective and constructed . 
  hence `` what people consider them to be '' is important in this case . 
  they are greek citizens and the greek state mistreated them but they are n't ethnic greeks by their own identification even . 
  that 's great but it does not contradict what i said . 
   it is n't whataboutism in the case of a treaty that is supposed to guarantee the rights of two respective communities . 
  turkey took marginalization to its extreme conclusion in various ways and it seemingly worked even better for the sake of any potential referendum . 
  more whataboutism . 
  whether turkey fucked over its greek minority does not give you the right to start fucking over random muslims dude in komotini . 
  why ? 
  because they had nothing to do with it . 
   erdogan 's `` ammunition '' , marginalization etc. 
  are all unimportant ( not ethically of course ) as long as western thrace remains predominantly greek . 
  if it ever became majority muslim , lack of marginalization or not , we 'd have reason to worry . 
  yes , disenfrachising parts of your country , esp . 
  when they are being courted by a foreign power is the way to go . 
  nothing wrong could ever happen . 
  i can only imagine the right using these people as a self-fulfilling prophecy : first , marginalize them . 
  second , wait until one of them does something stupid . 
  three , use it as an excuse for further nationalism i.e. 
  * see ? 
  we told you these people were all traitors !, 
  allright , no offence meant . 
  its just something fundamental and is the bedrock upon the modern greek identity has been constructed upon . 
  very few people aspire for a modern , secular society anyway . 
   the constitution merely recognises the religious denomination of the majority of the country 's citizens as it has been since the creation of the modern greek state . 
  i do n't think the constitution is descriptive . 
  it is not a document that reflects on the popular sentiment of the current year . 
  you think they run polls every years and update it based on what people believe ? 
  the constitution is prescriptive i.e. 
  it is meant to cement and enforce christianity as the prevailing religion . 
  otherwise there is little sense in adding that article . 
   it may seem like it does , but greece does n't have a state relgion . 
  let us examine that article . 
  what makes a country secular ? 
  according to the wiki :  1 . 
  refuses to commit itself as a whole to any one view of the nature of the universe and the role of man in it . 
  is not homogeneous , but is pluralistic . 
  is very tolerant . 
  it widens the sphere of private decision-making . 
  while every society must have some common aims , which implies there must be agreed on methods of problem-solving , and a common framework of law ; in a secular society these are as limited as possible . 
  problem solving is approached rationally , through examination of the facts . 
  while the secular society does not set any overall aim , it helps its members realize their aims . 
  is a society without any official images . 
  nor is there a common ideal type of behavior with universal application . 
  we score 0 out of 6 . 
  literally 0 . 
   they are n't ethnically greek , just greek citizens so what you mentioned is half-right . 
  i mentioned what people * consider * them to be , which was correct . 
  what the greek ethnicity is , is another issue altogether . 
   marginalization is a different issue , of course ( all citizens are supposed to be protected , not abused , by the state irrespective of ethnicity ) but i suppose the lausanne-respecting turkey no longer has the problem of ` referendums ' now that imbros and tenedos have no greek inhabitants . 
  whataboutism . 
  and marginalization is exactly the issue . 
  erdogan will talk shit , he always does , that does n't mean you have to keep giving him ammunition . 
   these were prosecutions for the breaking of laws passed by parliament , not witch trials . 
  they were laws concerning religion , enforced by the government , and rabidly supported by the church which protested with all its might . 
  so it fits the description perfectly whether you like it or not . 
   it is a great privilege that our country is set in a way that we have some oversight over them . 
  yeah i do n't think it is a great privilege to be arrested because i offended jesus on the internet . 
  but you `` as an atheist '' seem to praise this situation ? 
  it seems your argument is a weird whataboutism about russia and bulgaria . 
  i do n't really know what to say , besides that i am happy that some people stand up against the church , like the pasok government who successfully stood up to the bully known as christodoloulos . 
  if everybody thought like you , nobody would have stood up . 
   we 'll be dammed if kids do n't study the new testament in school . 
  we do not study the new testament in school . 
  we certainly do n't study for cultural , literature or historical purposes either . 
  take a look at the curriculum if you do n't believe me ( [ gymnasium ] ( http://www.iep.edu.gr/index.php/el/40-thriskeftika1/521-thriskeftika-didaktiko-yliko-dimotiko-2 ) , [ lyceum ] ( http://www.iep.edu.gr/index.php/el/menu-erga/menu-co-financed/40-thriskeftika1/522-thriskeftika-didaktiko-yliko-dimotiko-3 ) ) . 
  what we learn is various dogmatic points regarding mostly christianity , other religions are also examined from a obvious ( and unapologetic ) orthodox viewpoint . 
   the homeric epics were pretty much the bible of pagans no . 
  literally nobody has said this . 
  ever . 
   we better make school a safe place because someone might disagree with them ... tough luck , kid !, 
  you aint learning shit !, 
  this perfectly describes the church 's attitude when it comes to evolution and other `` progressive '' stuff . 
  let 's ban everything that disagrees with the official narrative . 
   i 'm against brexit , but where is the sense in a 2nd referendum ? 
  i dunno , maybe ask farage because [ he was demanding a second referendum in case they lost ] ( http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/nigel-farage-wants-second-referendum-7985017 ) . 
  but it seems that referendums are ok only if they support a specific agenda . 
  greece is not a secular country . 
  do n't take my word for it , but our constitution which makes that point very clear . 
  just read [ article 3 ] ( http://www.hri.org/docs/syntagma/artcl25.html#a3 ) . 
  that 's right . 
  no western country would do that . 
  it 's not like a western country would [ forbid its own people from holding another referendum ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/brexit-theresa-may-scottish-independence-referendum-rules-out-second-a7139391.html ) when it goes against its nationalistic agenda . 
   there has n't been a single political decision in greece that has been affected by the church in any way since the 1800s . 
  except there have been several . 
  most notable was [ father pastitsios ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/elder_pastitsios ) in 2012 . 
  in that case , the police [ raided the blogger 's house and searched his computers ] ( http://booksjournal.gr/slideshow/item/1528-%c2%ab%cf%80%cf%8e%cf%82-%ce%b2%ce%af%cf%89%cf%83%ce%b1-%cf%84%ce%bf%cf%85%cf%82-%ce%bd%cf%8c%ce%bc%ce%bf%cf%85%cf%82-%ce%ba%ce%b1%cf%84%ce%ac-%cf%84%ce%b7%cf%82-%ce%b2%ce%bb%ce%b1%cf%83%cf%86%ce%b7%ce%bc%ce%af%ce%b1%cf%82-%cf%83%cf%84%ce%b7%ce%bd-%ce%b5%ce%bb%ce%bb%ce%ac%ce%b4%ce%b1%c2%bb ) .

  another reason which i believe makes the greek people distrust the nato , is the fact that it takes a neutral stance on the issues greece has with turkey . 
  the whole `` we do n't involve ourselves in disputes between allies '' makes sense , but when one of your allies is bullied by another ally and you do nothing about it do n't expect the greek people to back nato with all their heart . 
   of course , greece was primarily responsible for the mess that necessitated its bail-out in 2010 , and when a country has unmanageable debt and an excessive budget deficit , it must adjust . 
  but design failures from the first two financial assistance programmes exacerbated greece 's falling gdp . 
  thus the responsibility for the failure of the first two financial assistance programmes falls both upon greece and official creditors , as is argued in this article . 
  did n't this satisfy you ? 
   lend greek people money where 's my paycheck ? 
  edit : you 're right edit2 : holy fuck 2017 is pay-year, 
  it 's not a new loan . 
  it 's an installment in return for further `` reforms '' , taxes , cuts , privatisations as it is agreed in the 3d bailout package . 
  and as soon as we get it , it 's going towards paying what we already owe , ~ ~ so it 's just going back to you . 
  no need to stress yourself out mate . ~ ~, 
  i 'm sorry that our governments were reluctant towards becoming an official protectorate . 
  is taking complete control of a member 's government part of the eurozone rules that you germans seem to be so fond of ? 
   they 're not gon na agree to a deal that involved giving up sovereignty actually we 've already agreed . 
  3 times . 
  the imf believes the greek debt is unsustainable and will skyrocket in the next decades , and wants a substantial debt relief . 
  it also believes that the 3.5 % primary surplus target set for 2018 will not be achieved , asking for a lower target ( 1.5 % ) . 
  if the europeans are not willing to lower their primary surplus target , the imf is asking for about 4bn worth of extra austerity measures in order to achieve the 3.5 % primary surplus target . 
  the europeans are not willing to accept a substantial debt relief for greece or lower primary surplus targets , believe that the 3.5 % primary surplus target is realistic and they are optimistic that it can be achieved without extra austerity measures . 
  they have no problem though with greece implementing the 4bn austerity measures in order to satisfy and keep the imf as a part of the greek programme . 
  the greek government claims that the 3.5 % primary surplus is achieveable without more measures , but would like to lower it in the future . 
  it also wants debt relief and is unwilling to take more austerity measures for 2018 and 2019 which it believes will hinder growth and are not needed to meet the surplus targets . 
  greek media are reporting that we 're heading towards a compromise where the greek parliament will pre-emptively vote for the austerity measures but will only implement them if they are needed . 
  if the imf and the eu agree with that . 
   why should you be the eu 's special snowflake ? 
  because your media says so , obviously . 
  like ~ ~ many ~ ~ some germans , you 're too focused on how greece got to the point it is today , ignoring the `` how to fix it '' part . 
  you 're just coming across as someone who does n't care about the latter , but draws satisfaction from the consequences of the former . 
  if things keep going the way they are , you 're condemning future generations for the sins of their ancestors . 
  germans were fortunate enough to not get that treatment , but here you are , advocating the destruction of greece for the acts of the past . 
  fun fact :  on 23 april 2010 during a visit at the island of kastelorizo , papandreou issued a statement to the press that he instructed finance minister papakonstantinou to officially ask the eu partners to activate the support mechanism . 
  [ here 's ] ( https://youtu.be/4pc_d1m82uq ) the video . 
  ask him what he thinks about the western and russian influence in greece . 
  i dare you . 
   let us not pretend that there is anyone at fault for the situation in greece except for greece i agree , but you should also stop pretending that you 're `` helping '' . 
  unfortunately , the word `` reform '' has lost its meaning for a big part of the greek people . 
  it has become a synonym of cuts or taxes . 
  if i remember correctly , the target required for the 2017 primary surplus is 1.5 % ( it 's at 1.8 % in the budget voted ~ ~ some months ~ ~ less than a month ago ) . 
  we already have 2.5 b in tax raises that will take effect in 2017 , i do n't know how they will affect the growth that 's expected for that year . 
  the fun starts in 2018 , in which we 're expected to have a 3.5 % primary surplus . 
  we 're also supposed to keep getting 3.5 % primary surpluses indefinitely ( until the lenders allow us to lower the target ) . 
  it 's 40 years of puppet governments actually . 
  i can see how it could be an emotional topic in many poorer eu countries , but think about this , specifically for bulgaria : there are thousands of greek businesses which have moved to bulgaria and greek money invested in bulgaria since the crisis hit us , on top of those that already existed there before the crisis . 
  in a way , greek austerity is fueling growth in bulgaria . 
  the thing is though , that if something happens in greece , like a default , a big chunk of them will be gone , so bulgaria will take a hit as well . 
  therefore , at this point , greece doing good is in bulgaria 's interests . 
  oh , you 've been to basically every restaurant in greece ? 
  or maybe your country 's media have been on every greek restaurant and did a really trustworthy report ? 
  of course you should n't give a fuck bro . 
  your opinion does n't matter anyway . 
  you 're not part of the eurozone . 
  the programme is there to make greece stand on its own feet , grow and eventually be able to service the debt on its own . 
  we exceeded the target dictated by the programme , which means that an unnecessary ammount of money was removed from the greek economy , thus hindering growth . 
  if , i assume you agree with me on that , the aim is to enable greece to pay back its debts in the future , greece needs to grow . 
  so the right thing to do , is pour those excess money back to the greek economy . 
  was giving them to poor pensioners , school lunches in a poor area , and choosing not to raise the vat on the islands hit by the refugee crisis in 2017 the right choice ? 
  the money could 've used in a better way to maximize the effect on the greek economy . 
  is it a populist move ? 
  sure , as far as the tip to the low-pensioners is concerned . 
  but think about this . 
  is n't advocating this 600m of excess surplus go to service the debt ( like many people here are saying ) populism ? 
  it is populism as well . 
  it does n't serve any purpose , and will definitely contribute negatively in the success of the programme . 
  it will only make some people feel nice , and morally superior for `` making greece finally pay something back to us '' , the worst kind of populism imo . 
  edit : minor tweaks . 
  why not illegally print a couple of billion euros like a certain country did in the past ? 
  that 's the thing . 
  greece did meet the surplus target , the government implemented whatever austerity measures were asked from them . 
  the problem is that they decided to use the money that exceeded the surplus target for whatever reason they see fit . 
  i do n't really know if our government is doing something that goes against the deal . 
  the previous government ( new democracy ) did the same by the way , but our previous government was part of the european people 's party , so maybe that 's why they were allowed to do it , right ? 
  it 's kind of infuriating tbh . 
  unless it 's specifically stated in the agreement that whatever extra revenue is generated beyond the ( 0.5 % for 2016 ) primary surplus target should be used as the troika sees fit / `` pay debts '' / saved ( which would be infuriating in itself anyway imo ) , this shit is pure punishment . 
  sure , tsipras decided to use it to get some votes in the next elections . 
  how well the government uses this money is debatable , but that 's up to the greek people to decide , not the troika . 
  there are already agreed upon measures for 2017 ( 2.5 billion in direct and indirect taxes ) plus the new possible `` reforms '' that will be required for the second review ( there 's been rumors on the media about more pension cuts and possible public worker wage cuts in some sectors ) . 
  i 'm no expert , but they seem as recessionary measures to me . 
  there 's also the 3.5 % primary surplus target for 2018 that probably ca n't be met without more austerity . 
  if i remember correctly , it 's 360 euro plus 10 % per kid . 
  if one is living alone or has a family it 's definitely not enough . 
  if it 's a young person living with his/her parents it 's ok i suppose ( if the parents have a job ) . 
  a friend of mine used to be on unemployment benefits , and he never mentioned late payments . 
  you do n't get any unemployment benefits if you quit your job , only if you 're laid off . 
  my grandfather gets a pension of 480 $ , soon to be 360 $ . 
  just hang on , we 're getting there . 
  i hope you 'll get to like our rich , lazy asses then . 
  this time it 's not about austerity . 
  greece has already implemented and voted on the austerity measures . 
  some minor reforms are left to be completed which , from what i understand , are agreed upon and it 's just a matter of time until they 're implemented . 
  the problem is that germany wants the imf to participate in the programme but does n't want to talk debt relief but the imf demands a debt relief plan in order to participate . 
  they 're essentially delaying the second review conclusion ( which releases the funds so we do n't default in july ) while arguing , damaging the greek economy in the proccess . 
   nobody ever `` finished '' a home in greece because of the finished tax i do n't really know where you got that from . 
  in order to get electricity/water etc , one has to have a `` finished '' house . 
   which explain why all greeks house in the country have a yet-to-be-done floor building a house was like the `` ultimate '' goal for most greek families . 
  that 's why many people started building one , got the first floor where the family would leave in , and had got a permit for more floors so in the future the children , with the help of the family , would build another one-two-three floors ( depending on how many children there are ) . 
  this way the parents felt like they left something behind for their children and it also kept the family together . 
  so what you saw was either ugly design , or a `` finished '' floor , with floors waiting to be finished piece by piece , gradually over the years through savings that , in many cases , meant having a shitty car or maybe not going on vacation . 
  these homes are now taxed like there 's no tommorrow . 
  the only way for greece to get access to qe is by completing the second review .

   having some turkish influence in your modern greek culture does n't make you of lesser value . 
  stop making childish assumptions . 
  i did n't imply something like this . 
   but you use your local products how turkish people do too . 
  how do you know that , mr. know-it-all ? 
  btw i 'm pretty sure that people across the world use their local products in a similar way . 
   but you are making \u03bd\u03c4\u03bf\u03bb\u03bc\u03b1\u03b4\u03b1\u03ba\u03b9\u03b1 , like the turkish do to . 
  so turks and greeks eat exactly the same fucking dolmadaki . 
  in greece we call it ` gemista ' . 
  in greece they are cooked different too , in turkey they use various different stuffed products , while in greece it 's cooked more simply . 
  it 's not a greek dish anyway . 
  also , if a german makes a kebab , that does n't make him culturally similar to turks , can you understand that ? 
  this is a good example . 
   greek music and turkish music sounds similar . 
  full stop . 
  stop talking as if you know everything . 
  anatolian music ( amanedes for example ) sounds similar to turkish because , simply , it 's anatolian music . 
  cretan music sounds nothing like turkish music for example . 
   the differences are like between france and italy . 
  this is a proof that you do n't know what you 're talking about . 
   edit : its funny how similar you are to erdogan . 
  he wants to be right all the time too . 
  i 'm the one who 's `` similar '' to this cunt huh , not you ? 
  when you had no arguments left , you started insulting me . 
  do you think i missed your previous comment when you were insulting me ? 
  you sneakily deleted it of course . 
  it 's not my problem if you ca n't hold a conversation like a proper human being . 
   you asked for cultural similarities between spain and arabia and i provided you with examples so spain is culturally similar to morocco just because spain was ruled by arabs who left some arabic architecture ? 
  are you kidding me ? 
   i care that both cultures are eating the same food first of all , the way you type makes you look like a retard . 
  secondly , the tomatoes and corn i eat do n't make me culturally similar with the aztecs . 
   but we are talking about traditional music , laika tragoudia , which are similar to traditional turkish music . 
  ` laika ' are not traditional greek music . 
  the reason that they are similar to some type of turkish music is because ` laila ' were brought in greece by anatolian refugees . 
   the fucking ottoman administrations are turkish you twat . 
  yeah , they ottomans copied some of their administration methods from the byzantines , so what ? 
  again , the brits took many greek words and put them in the english language , that does n't make the greeks and the brits similar . 
  also stop insulting people for no reason like you 're some fucking thug . 
  grow up . 
   you have never been to andalusia the article you sent me is about buildings that remained after the arabs left . 
  it also showed flamenco dance and a local dish . 
  i asked about cultural similarities . 
   mezes is a turkish word . 
  tzatiki , baklavas , halvas , kataifi , soutzoukakia , giuverlakia , kokoretsi , dolmadakia ... should i go on ? 
  same roots , similar dishes with slight variation depending on regional products . 
  these foods were brought in greece by anatolian refugees . 
  i 'm not denying that they have anatolian origins . 
  kebab is very famous in northern europe , that does n't make northern european cuisine similar to turkish cuisine . 
   both listened in turkey and in greece !!!!!, 
  so since greeks listen a lot to american music , greek music is similar to american music ? 
   no time to write this up , look here do you realize that the answer to the question focused on how the byzantine empire influenced ottoman administration and not turkish culture ? 
   what a stupid example : the words you listed are used in every other language as well . 
  the words i listed are random turkish words only used by greeks . 
  greeks use italian words as well , it does n't make greek and italian similar . 
  also , ` ela ' is not a turkish word . 
   it is undeniable that greece and turkey share a lot of cultural similarities because of historical reasons . 
  since turks were in greece for 400 years you ca n't argue that some cultural aspects have remained . 
  iberia was ruled by the arabs for 781 years , does that make spain and portugal similar to the arabic countries ? 
   greek food is a refined variant of turkish food . 
  what are you talking about ? 
  besides some few dishes who were introduced in greece by anatolian refugees like mousaka , there are no similarities between greek and turkish food . 
  turkish food is very exotic and has taken influences from arabia to bosnia . 
   where do you think is `` tsifteteli '' coming from ? 
  tsifteteli is anatolian music . 
   where do you think was yogurt invented before we perfected it ? 
  variants of yogurt were being made in ancient greece . 
   keep denying it , but us greeks and them turkish share a lot of modern culture . 
  be it that greeks influenced turkish , or turkish influenced greeks . 
  i have made my conclusions from people who have actually visited turkey . 
   there is a huge influence in modern turkish culture by the byzantines as well . 
  how ? 
  geography , physics , anatomy , technology , economics , harmony , architecture , atmosphere , program , rhetoric , nostalgia , mathematics , planet , athlete , alphabet , alchemy , academy . 
  only some english words of greek origin . 
  does that mean that english and greek languages are similar ? 
  ( they are both of indo-european origin but that 's another story ) were are the cultural similarities ? 
  btw did you really think that amanedes is greek music ? 
  it 's anatolian music that was brought in greece by anatolian refugees , it 's not greek . 
   we have a lot of similarities in our culture and language i do n't agree , my sister has been to turkey and told me that it gives a completely different vibe than europe . 
  and language ? 
  seriously ? 
  yeah , it 's the greek word for ` speech ', 
  there are no greek spoken in turkey, 
  you sound like some mafia leader . 
  i just corrected you , not playing games or something . 
  all i see is `` vino '' and `` bor '' , that makes for 2 words . 
  ~ ~ ` alliences ' ~ ~ ` alliances ' ? 
  ` assistances ' ? 
  what ? 
  no , but you 're commenting everywhere so it 's not that hard that i noticed that comment of yours . 
  yeah , it means doghouse . 
  that kind of music is shit . 
  it 's not famous in greece though, 
  not true, 
  why should you be hating the greeks ? 
   except for the janissaries source ? 
  the janissaries were christian children who were taken away from their families and were forcefully converted to islam  there has been a discussion with someone , nobody refuted anyone then why are n't you answering to him ? 
   no i did n't what did you claim then ? 
   i claimed that since greek and turkish music share the same roots , which is the same as an eastern mediterrenean empire , greek music is not quite european . 
  therefore , since the official language of nigerian is english , it 's safe to say that english is an african language ? 
  you do n't make sense .

  the potato is honored in society , and many latvians do not eat chips ( french fries ) . 
  potato consumption is more prevalent among latvians in the larger latvian subcontinent , for example , tamil latvia in latvysia . 
  in the majority of latvian states it is illegal to eat or possess potato . 
  other than the europa and fyrom one , what others were there ? 
  wait , what ? 
   `` money exists '' that 's a litteral word for word direct quote by the way . 
  nobody likes it when their history is being stolen . 
  except maybe the germans . 
  right , meanwhile the thousands of articles calling him litterally worse than hitler and auschwitz put toogether can be brushed off to the side . 
  break your bubble . 
  dude , you ca n't be serious ? 
  what i mean by smear campaing is what you 'll see if you read a couple of articles from left leaning sites . 
  appart from constantly calling him a nazi and a facist , there is the constant addition to the articles `` why you should be scared , why it 's scary , why it 's horrible , why trump will start ww3 . '', 
  there 's been a nonstop attempt to demonize litterally everything he does and protray him as some sort of boogeyman . 
  if you can not see the smear campaign no mater which side you 're on your bias has overtaken your common sense . 
   as a person , he 's a racist , sexist , obnoxious , self-obsessed , thin-skinned asshole how is he racist and sexist ? 
   you lost by 3 fucking million votes but still got the job too bad the winner was n't determined by popular votes . 
   even if we take him at his word that it is n't racist ( which we should n't , given how many times he has called for a muslim ban in the past ) , muslims are n't a race . 
   nd his general attempts to undermine democracy and free press . 
  that 's because the `` free press '' is trying to undermine him . 
   oh , and the ever-mounting pile of evidence of at least some level of collusion with the russians . 
  put up or shut up . 
  for 4 months since he won , the left has been bitching about russia nonstop with the only actual proof they have being [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/gnquecw.gifv ) . 
  the `` obama is a muslim from kenya '' conspiracies hold more credibillity than the trump russia ones . 
  are you saying there have been no smear attemps from the left ? 
  what is the pun in waffel ss ? 
  the nonstop smear campaign by the left sure has n't helped people make an objective descision . 
  i 'd love to see what people have to think about trump 's actions without having their judgement clouded first . 
  i read that as australian in the title and i was wondering why was the picture in german . 
  it 's a mystery if the posters were by pro brexit or anti brexit people . 
  pretty sure this map is wrong . 
  it includes japan . 
   true , you just said that it was n't a relevant response to your bs crying about fanaticism , because it was `` just one '' . 
  read up the chain . 
  what the hell are you even talking about ? 
  the chain is about which side as a whole is more fanatic . 
  i do n't understand what you 're trying to say . 
  edit : i think i get what you mean now . 
  read my entire bloody comment instewd of the first sentence . 
  i want to get news , but i do n't want this sub to turn into a feelgood `` our side is right on everything , look these news stories validating our side '' echo chamber like the pool of stale cum r/politics has turned into from all the circlejerking . 
  is there more nuance to these stories about brexit we 're seeing ? 
  are they truths of half truths ? 
  where are the stories about the benefits and how england/the uk has benefited ? 
  surely , such a large complicated political move must have effects that are both good and bad , politics is n't black and white after all . 
  i just feel like ignoring reality even when it shows us wrong will only push us into a bubble . 
  i want to know how brexit has affected the uk . 
  but everyone is so polarized there are no neutral sources anymore . 
  anti brexit sources portray the uk as a fallout style wasteland while pro brexit sources portray the uk as vault city/vault 8 among a nuclear wasteland that they claim the eu is . 
  how ironic would that be ? 
  read the chain or stop playing stupid . 
  i have not a single time said that killing muslims is a good idea . 
  this is a discussion about which side as a whole is more fanatic . 
  for fucks sake , it ' e not even a long chain . 
  and that 's why people make fun of english . 
  why not ? 
  yea , and technically speaking [ ghoti ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ghoti ) is a valid way to spell fish . 
  sub saharan africans master race confirmed . 
  really ? 
  people misspell it as seig ? 
  all you got ta do is phonetically spell it out to get it right . 
  read up the chain . 
  seriously , it 's not hard . 
  what did he say ? 
   false equivalence . 
  i 'm glad to know you 're more concerned about property damage than 6 murder victims of a self-proclaimed trumpist terrorist . 
  die you read the original comment or did you skip to the end of the chain ? 
  this is a disussion about which side is more fanatic . 
  1 person doing something nobody on that side approved < holding multiple mass riots accross cities destroying property and beating people up like , yes . 
  people dying is bad . 
  but is n't all we keep hearing `` do n't judge a side based on isolated incidents commited by a single person '' ? 
  we 're measuring which side as a whole is more fanatic . 
  riots ca n't happen without a lot of people sharing the same objective and ideology . 
  on the other hand everyone can grab a weapon and go do an isolated act . 
   did trump and bannon distance themselves from that btw ? 
  no , i 'm pretty sure the very next day trump went out and said : `` lol gj fam , thank for killing these ragheads keep the good work up '' while bannon said : `` thanks for speeding up our final solution of wiping all muslims off the face of the earth . 
  would you rather a girl lets you grab or would you rather a girl doese n't let you grab her ? 
  that was decried by the right . 
  on the other hand you got just about 20 or so riots where people got beat up and property got destroyed endorsed by a large part of the left . 
   unlike the president , please make sure you have the girl 's consent before going for it he said they let you do it . 
  check the link of the person i replied to . 
  check the link he originally posted to decry the right . 
  i was n't aware he went out and said `` gj fam go out nad fuck more muslims up '', 
  is white catholic or protestant ? 
  yes . 
  6 people did die . 
  and the single person that did it was decried by everyone . 
  again , a single person that nobody supported doing something bad does not make his side the fanatic one . 
  groups of people with massive support rioting and beating people up does . 
   because riots and terrorist acts are comparable you 're talking about who is more fanatic . 
  the left has been rioting destroying property and beating people up regularily since trump . 
  you 're comparing a group of people doing something on a regular basis to one person doing 1 thing a single time . 
   right wing terrorism is just a thing , no big concern here who has destroyed more property since trump won ? 
  the left with it 's constant riots , and antifa which is essentially a terrorist organization at this point , or the right with ... 
  hold on a second wait , the right has n't had any riots . 
   smh try a bit harder , i do n't think your head is quite up far enough to comfortably enjoy the scent of your own gas yet . 
  there 's been multiple riots by large leftist groups composed ot multiple people though . 
  this is just 1 thing commited by 1 person . 
  i read somewhere that calling saint patrick , st. patty instead of paddy triggers irishmen more than calling fyrom macedonia triggers greeks , is it true ? 
  is this army a joke or am i missing something, 
  how big is a troop ?

  everyone does . 
  it 's politics . 
   i have done neither of those things you just did . 
  you asked me out of nowhere something irrelevant . 
  the other guy started accusing me that i am denying facts , it sounds like you are following in his footsteps . 
  why would you even need to ask otherwise ? 
  let me ask you , what do you think a progressive liberal would think of hundreds of sexual assault complaints ? 
  honest reply . 
   a thousand women were assaulted only 1 thousand ? 
  why not 5 thousand ? 
  actually by 6th of april there were 529 complaints of sexual assault . 
  this started out at ~ 150 complaints and kept increasing until april . 
  and the only reason i mention this is n't because i doubt them ( i absolutely do n't doubt them ) but because we all know that if it was n't muslims we would be dismissing those women in no time . 
  women partying at night , 4 months later start accusing others of sexual assault ? 
  they would be talked down as hysterical feminazis , or even sluts who were looking for it and later changed their minds , as we very often hear . 
  but now we are taking them seriously ( as we should ) only because muslims are involved . 
  not only that , but apparently we can double the number of complaints as you did , because we have an agenda to push , right ? 
   does it have to happen weekly to matter ? 
  we are not talking if it `` matters '' but about its frequency . 
  and i was curious to see how often he thinks women are getting gangraped , since he mentioned it . 
  but i guess i wo n't find out because now he switched to soviet occupation . 
  now i think it matters regardless of frequency . 
  but its hard to follow you guys if you keep changing the goalposts . 
  every second comment to talk about something else , as if all you care about is to stir the pot and generate anger and toxicity against immigrants ( duh ) and against myself ( for attributing things to me that i did n't say ) . 
  you are not going to visit the continent because of that ? 
  like do you think that you will get raped in the next 2 years if you visit europe ? 
  if you truly believe that then its better if you stay where you are . 
  hillarious how you responded with exactly what i predicted . 
  complaining that i would `` ad hominem '' you ? 
  check . 
  insulting others about being in `` denial '' regarding where they live ? 
  check . 
  claiming that you know better than others regarding their country and lives ? 
  check . 
  being an angry and fearmongering propagandist * in general * ? 
  check . 
  do you live in kreuzberg now ? 
  if so , how long have you lived there ? 
  or did you just google and found about that video ? 
  rhetorical questions . 
  all you can do is shut down any discussion on these issues by personally attacking others with the methods i illustrated above . 
  it 's like you are reading from a manual somewhere , like you have a checklist of what to say . 
  and i am honestly surprise that you did n't complain about being called a racist , since its your modus operandi . 
  come on . 
  nobody called you a racist this time ? 
  wo n't you complain about that ? 
   you make it seem as if the `` far right '' merely made up the rapes which is not the case . 
  i do n't make it seem like this , you are just providing the standard reply when the narrative is questioned : accusing others of denying facts . 
  do you really think your visit to cologne or berlin will be more dangerous today than , say , 6 months ago ? 
  of course . 
  every other comment you write is shit-talking against germany . 
  germans are under some muslim invasion and they are too weak or stupid to stand up , etc. 
  you were the one quick to jump the gun when [ the insane native german stabbed some people ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4inz3z/four_seriously_hurt_in_munich_station_attack/d2zo1i0?context=3 ) in munich , because like the rest , you thought it was related to muslim refugees . 
  you will complain of `` ad hominem '' but that is not my point . 
  i want to demonstrate selection bias . 
  or , how people like you repeatedly post the worst stories imaginable along with repeated insults and dire warnings ( we will all get raped ! ), 
  and accusations of denialism ( you are being raped and you do n't care lol ! ), 
  to give the impression that things are collapsing here in europe . 
  in fact i expect a sarcastic accusation of denialism right about now , as if i needed some enraged ideologue to tell me how life is in the country i currently live in . 
  and its strange that 90 % of these horrific warnings against us being raped come from people who are not germans or do n't live in germany . 
  of course i 've seen germans complain too , but they are a minority . 
   i would remind the native women that mass immigration would make running the gauntlet more frequent , perhaps as frequent as every thursday orieteering . 
  so is this your final construct ? 
  when should we expect these weekly rapefests ? 
  are they already happening with all these refugees who have invaded , or is it like next year ? 
  you kind of proved my point . 
  do n't come to europe , or you will run the rape gauntlet full of refugee rapists . 
  do you really believe that or do you just enjoy talking like this ? 
  are you kidding me ? 
  the article is n't even free so people get to freak out without even having the possibility of informing themselves . 
  its a win/win juncker mention in the title = instant rage juncker saying someting against the far right = instant uncontrollable earthshaking rage, 
  great point . 
  do n't use democratic means , just start a coup . 
  that will show that fascist juncker !, 
  let 's show him how much of a fascist he is , by starting a coup !, 
  this is to be expected . 
  when the economy takes a hit , the right wing is on the rise . 
  this is always the case . 
  however this time around we had the syrian refugee crisis exploding ( which was a long time coming , [ caused by climate change ] ( http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/ominous-story-of-syria-climate-refugees/ ) more than anything else ) and the various fringe groups latched onto it . 
  they used social media in a frankly impressively effective manner to get their message across : europe is under attack , civil war , refugees are raping white women left and right . 
  i am not exaggerating . 
  people were literally asking if its safe to visit cologne or will they get raped ? 
  literally . 
  so i think that its a combination of : * very bad recession that still is n't totally over * refugee crisis happening at the worst moment * use of social media in politics , for the first time in history , especially from the far right especially for the last point , it will take some time to adjust to this new reality . 
  we are still witnessing the birth pains of public online `` discourse '' which , to be honest , is hard to separate from trolling . 
  there is [ some research ] ( http://journalistsresource.org/studies/politics/citizen-action/research-internet-effects-politics-key-studies ) done but the public is still not comfortable in this new mode of debating . 
   but they claim not to hold these views . 
  why would they ? 
  most people would be disgusted at these views . 
  so they need to pretend that they are ordinary people who are merely ... critical of mass immigration . 
  in reality they are far right ideologues that hold very conservative views . 
  they just need to `` sneak '' them in popular discourse by deceiving and lying . 
   so being right is being against abortion , not understanding simple consequences of greenhouse gasses , etc. ? 
  maybe you can answer my question , instead of asking me to label you : was the cdu `` lacking understanding simple consequences of greenhouse gasses '' in 2006 ? 
  is this what you tell people to get them to vote for them ? 
  * do n't worry , they 'll be fine around 2030 . 
  2035 the latest . 
  just hang in there !, 
   example : the dutch pvv is that an example or the entirety of a very short list ? 
  more like  exception : the dutch pvv,

  also , why do you confuse vat with corporate tax ? 
  the thing that you do n't know is under our current system , corporations/small businesses pay 100 % of the due tax plus 55 % of the next year 's tax as an advance . 
  it 's a miracle idea the from 2013 tax law that works under the assumption that you 're gon na have more profits next year so just give us the advance now so we can have more liquidity . 
  so , i , too believe that it 's 2 ) which will kill whatever small business sector there 's left . 
  so , this is n't true ? 
   standard vat rate : 23 % ( jan 2011 )  reduced vat rates : 13 % foodstuffs , agricultural supplies  reduced vat rates : 6 % foodstuffs , books , pharmaceutical , medical , newspapers , hotels , passenger transport  portugal drops 2015 vat hike [ source ] ( http://www.vatlive.com/vat-rates/european-vat-rates/eu-vat-rates/ ), 
  since op above has n't responded , i call dibs on your invitation and i 'll show your printed comment to the immigration office < 3 thanks !, 
  and your point ? 
  we actively ** want ** to pay more ? 
  we should bargain for prices ? 
   you would need around 2,338.81 $ ( 10,286.55 lei ) in athens to maintain the same standard of life that you can have with 7,200.00 lei in bucharest ( assuming you rent in both cities ) . 
  this does n't fit your views for a complete comparison ? 
  that shows you 'd need +40 % more money to maintain a similar lifestyle . 
  ( even if that auto-calculated example the `` lifestyle '' threshold is stupidly high ), 
  sure , you take 1 indicator that shows that to you and you turn this around . 
  ignoring all the main indicators that have a percentage comparison . 
  i can do the same with a berlin - athens comparison , with `` better '' results . 
  when incomes go down really fast , does n't mean that the prices of consumer goods or services will follow at the same pace . 
  especially when you rely on imports for many categories . 
  but what are the romanians or former soviet block users of / r/europe gon na comment now ?!, 
  y u do dis . 
  seriously , the amount of such comments the past month - mostly - is ridiculous . 
  if yes/no referendum options had 50 % each before the juncker speech , it just got shifted towards 70 % `` no '' . 
  amateurs . 
  greek government & ez , bunch of crazy monkeys . 
  thankfully - some bank branches will open for pensioners - i do hope not just for today & that this wo n't result in people trying to rush in under panic even though they 're not pensioners just to get money out . 
  head of bank of greece ( stournaras ) requested the capital controls after a system banks meeting and said that if the request is n't granted by varoufakis he will quit . 
  who said anything about photoshop ? 
  you do n't even get what i 'm talking about . 
  i ca n't take adonis seriously . 
  both adonis tweet image and the 4 above ( including the one from 8 months ago or something ) are from the national bank of greece atms . 
  along with piraeusbank is the biggest bank with less atm points and with a lot of pensioners having their accounts there . 
  there have always been lines in their stores and atms , ** always ** . 
  glad that someone else noticed that as well . 
  the whole debt restructuring/plan for sustainability in the long term request bundled in this deal was always out of the question . 
  suddenly , it was in the discussion ... right . 
  all of the bailout money are under british law . 
  ( so , ~ 80 % of the debt ), 
  surely . 
  the eurogroup will decide . 
  we 'll know for sure in a few hours . 
  the question will be for something that 's currently on the table ( unless eurogroup decides it 's not anymore ) how naive can you be to think that syriza could only propose cuts , based on what the creditors demanded ? 
  the best bet was a mixture of both spending cuts and taxes to balance the taxing system , ** only ** if there was an inclusion of some debt restructuring in the deal . 
  this is what 's all about . 
  we need to have surpluses to maintain debt repayment but we ca n't do it for long without a debt structure that will allow the budget to breath in the longrun to ensure growth . 
   2.3 editorialising is not acceptable . 
  editorialising is simply the act of inserting an opinion into a ( submission ) title . 
  you should , in most cases , use the title on the page you are linking to . 
  however , in the case of youtube , you may have to be inventive and attempt to create an nonpartisan and neutral title if the one the youtube video uses is clearly partisan and bias . 
  welp . 
  the mode they show images from an atm with a queue the more panic they create to those watching whom in turn they queue to their closest atm just in case . 
  my dad just called me and asked me to go withdraw some money `` just in case '' because `` people are lining up to get theirs '' . 
  it 's not a bank run . 
  but it is spreading fear . 
  re-read my comment . 
  i did n't say that noone is there because they 're afraid the atms wo n't have money tomorrow or on monday . 
  at the same time , i ca n't expect all those with the padofles ( flip-flops ) to have the critical thinking and patience to not rush to an atm . 
  ( an example , i have nothing against flip-flops or people wearing them ), 
  for fuck 's sake . 
  the fear mongering by the greek media right now - as always before - is outrageous . 
  people were lining up at the atms way early this evening because pensions were being deposited due to the weekend before the end of the month . 
  of course there are people at some atms forming lines , of course some are not pensioners but it 's friday night . 
  i was just out for a dog walk , one of the biggest banks had a line of 2 people . 
  the other 8 people . 
  this is about a whole agreement on fiscal measures with both the ez and the imf on board . 
  [ a nice - imo - recap on the story so far by paul mason can be read here ] ( https://medium.com/@paulmasonnews/tsipras-goes-for-referendum-on-5-july-bf4c58d02534 ), 
  the constitution does n't allow a referendum on fiscal matters related to a voted law . 
  this is n't the case . 
  this will be a referendum for an urgent national matter . 
  ( [ analysis by a greek lawyer ] ( http://elawyer.blogspot.gr/2011/10/blog-post_31.html?spref=tw ) on the matter - it 's in greek , not sure if google translate will make sense ), 
  the ela liquidity is tied to the program greece is currently in . 
  if this is extended while the referendum takes place then the support to greek banks will continue . 
  ( this is what tsipras asked now ) now if the program officially ends at 30th of june without any extension , yes , ecb will pull support . 
  there is no default if the imf payment is missed . 
  there is a whole process ( i think up to 3 months ) for a payment to go from overdue to a state of * default *, 
  i have a strong feeling that the majority will vote for the offer as it 's the way to stay in the ez . 
  chain of reactions tho : since syriza is for `` no '' , if there is an alternate result , i see a strong chance of elections . 
  will they be able to rectify the deal in between ? 
  i just love how with your first comment you call tsipras an arrogant prick , but not 10 minutes later , you appear to be exactly that . 
  just a small correction . 
  the `` hardouvelis email '' was a * proposal * towards the creditors that would cover 2015 based on their demands ( which were greater already ) . 
  and it did n't address a lot of creditors demands for reforms . 
  it was a proposal by nd to quickly wrap up things , get funding and go back to discussions for longterm measures . 
  comparing the ~ 8bil of the syriza proposal - rest of 2015 and 2016 + - ( which i do n't like at all ) with that , is like comparing apples with oranges , and it has recently become an easy argument by nd party members . 
  you misunderstood . 
  there are several people arriving e.g. 
  by boat through turkey that have no identification whatsoever and usually claim they 're afghan ( older days during the war ) or syrians so they can claim asylum . 
  the same way dijsselbloem had said that a debt relief/restructuring was certain to happen at the end of the 2nd program but then changed to a new promise tied to surpluses ? 
  as i said ... 
  i have no faith , nor courage to hope for much . 
   according to the minister , greece received $ 360 million to build asylum capacities i 've never heard of that that before . 
  i do know however that $ 360 million were to be spent by amif during 2014-2020 for such expenses . 
  ( throughout europe )  kali\u0148\u00e1k stressed that italy , for example , is a safe country , but the migrants want to go further . 
  `` why do they push themselves on to france and then to britain ? 
  it 's not just an honest effort to save their lives . 
  italy or turkey would do . 
  well , this sums the whole article . 
  of course , greece and italy should just cover the whole mediterranean sea and be the watch dogs while frontex is underfunded and not so efficient . 
  by the way , where should we sent those undocumented people that wash up to southern eu shores ? 
  what a crazy ride .

lol no , not at all . 
  i was just talking about vice documentaries in general , not only about this particular one . 
   i 'm sure most decent people prefer junkies and anarchists in their neighborhoods to fascists in their neighborhoods . 
  most decent people preffer other decent people . 
  a fascist will kill you because you 're gay , a junkie will kill you because he 's out for money for his fix . 
  the result is the same . 
   lso , when the greek police tried encouraging drug-dealers to sell their poison in exarcheia citation ? 
   do you like people pressing against you in crowds ? 
  sometimes \u0295\u0298\u0305\u035c\u0298\u0305\u0294, 
  i 'm more concerned about his clothes thrown all over the place , it 's like the photographer caught him in the middle of a powerfap session . 
  exactly the same situation here . 
  personally i find the whole process completely pointless . 
  the over-romanticizing of extreme leftists , junkies and anarchists on vice makes me fucking sick . 
  neither side is without sins . 
  better hide yo ' debts . 
  stop complaining , we 've lost around 2000 . 
   the last time someone tried to bring peace , he was removed . 
  :( fify, 
  finaly a guy that gets it . 
  meatless fasolada is for peasants !, 
  according to continental history books it 's the other way around . 
  mmm pretty colors * drools *, 
  just when we 're beginning to stabilize . 
  god help us . 
  my memories pre '91 are realy vague but i do remember some things distinctly . 
  there was a major american base near my town and the whole town center was filled with american style caf\u00e9s , burger joints , bars and drunk military personnel occasionaly brawling with locals and each other . 
  ofcourse i was too young to know the political background behind this charade . 
  then came the collapse of the eastern block and all kinds of people starting pouring in from our northern borders . 
  that was quite a shock for greek society which was n't used to the concept of immigrants in general . 
  people went paranoid and started barring themselves in during the night and blaming everything on those `` damn starving barbarians '' . 
  i also remember the colapse of yugoslavia quite vividly , it was a bigger deal than the collapse of the rest of the eastern block here , due to them being our neighbours . 
  all in all the cold war has left quite a scar here , due to the civil war and the 7 year junta regime . 
  people still hold grudges over ideology to this day . 
  wait ... how do you sell a forest ? 
  whenever i watch videos from russian dashcams i get the impression that the whole country is high as fuck . 
  do n't use the `` l '' word ffs . 
  i get panic attacks . 
  i would if i could . 
  with the crack included ofcourse . 
  half the money up front or no deal . 
  he 's gon na build ugly palaces in our clay ? 
  i think it 's problem with baba and penis . 
  that 's the exception that proves the rule . 
  we failed once in 2500 years and now you have to deal with erdogan :p, 
  saving dem yurops since 490 b.c. 
  glad to be of service . 
  i can confirm i 've never gotten a receipt when buying weed from albanian roma . 
  too bad the caliph position is taken though :(, 
  so poetic :'), 
  * remove cheeseburger , remove cheeseburger !, 
  * * you are the worst food !, 
  * * remove cheeseburger !, 
  * * i make you go kaput !, 
  sad but true . 
  hahahaha you cought me , i 'm the biggest dish breaker there is :p, 
  to be fair , he did make a city out of a poor goatherder 's village . 
  too bad otto 's peepee did n't work . 
  ( i suppose that 's what he meant , because he had to burn munich to the ground to do it the other way around ;d ), 
  we just added 100 % more haram . 
  it actualy tastes good now . 
  did n't go so well last time we tried ... 
  14 wages ? 
  this is 2008 :p ( well it 's technicaly 14 here as well but christmas and summer wages have been halved ), 
  this is exactly why i do n't want to get into that kind of conversation . 
  opinions are like aholes , 
  de facto it 's a colony/puppet but let 's not get into that kind of conversation . 
  i might have come across as lecturing you but this is not `` what i want '' to call it , this is ehat the eu calls it . 
  this is why the whole island is highlighted instead of only the greek-speaking part . 
  `` listen to that bazooka music gordon ! '', 
  there is no `` southern part '' , it 's a single country with a portion of it 's territory , that only turkey recognises as an independent state , under occupation . 
  yep , you nailed it . 
   2 ) in greece , the same people ( those that are hated ) are elected over and over again and they will again be elected . 
  quote me on that . 
  because there is a very specific group of politicians that possess the capital and the connections to run for high offices . 
  you either vote of them or some obscure green party that gets a grand total of 2k votes and can not represent your interests in any way . 
  p.s i guess i did quote you on that , literally xd, 
  [ meanwhile in greece ] ( http://www.flickr.com/photos/75778871@n06/14065276117 ) are we doing it right guys ? 
  opressed minority detected ... is comrade putin still in serbia ? 
  but seriously now ... what does the greek minority in albania have to do with the drone strike in belgrade ? 
  both matches between greece and albania in the 2006 wc qualifiers looked like sunday school compared to this :p there was some provocation by both sides but this always the case between neighbouring countries in these parts . 
  banning is pretty much self-explanatory , no recognition means that we pretend homosex does not exist and look the other way ^ ^_^, 
  and then find a nice shade and take a nap for a couple of hours to digest it properly ... what was the sacrifice about again ? 
  sometimes when we 're stuck in the traffic we pray to hermes for winged tires ... 
  damn ... and we just found out 2 years later from wikipedia . 
  aparently nothing gets reported on greek news casts unless it 's about debts or riots . 
  this is so wrong ... 
  historians were reporting the existance of the tomb until the 16th century or so . 
  this is not disputed . 
  what is desputed is the actual identity of the body buried inside . 
  was it realy him or was it a ptolemaic publicity stunt ? 
  priests are allowed to marry , monks are not . 
  i think we win . 
  we have an actual mini theocracy within our borders :p well maybe italy can top us . 
  according to the most popular version of history yes . 
  it was mummified and put on display in alexandria . 
  ofcourse , but it 's one of the argead characteristics that we have hard evidence about . 
  this particular tomb does n't look epirotan or thracian so far , unless there is a crazy plot twist further on . 
  well even though i 've been to some digsites as a volunteer , my historical knowledge is definately better than my archaeological . 
  that could be the case there . 
  or it could be something else that we do n't know because we 're not on the spot .

  - `` the burning of the ottoman frigate at eressos by dimitrios papanikolis '' by konstantinos volanakis . 
  * general info about the revolution : * - in 1814 , a secret organization called the [ filiki eteria ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/filiki_eteria ) was founded with the aim of liberating greece . 
  the filiki eteria planned to launch revolts in the peloponnese , the danubian principalities , and in constantinople and its surrounding areas . 
  the organization was heavily influenced by the italian [ carbonari ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/carbonari ) and freemasonry . 
  - this greek movement for independence was not only the first movement of national character in eastern europe , but also the first one in a non-christian environment , like the ottoman empire - because of the greek origin of so much of the west 's classical heritage , there was tremendous sympathy for the greek cause throughout europe . 
  some wealthy americans and western european aristocrats , such as the renowned poet lord byron and later the physician [ samuel howe ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/samuel_gridley_howe ) , took up arms to join the greek revolutionaries - the classicist [ edward everett ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/edward_everett ) , professor of greek at harvard , was active in championing the greek cause in the united states and in november 1821 published an appeal from adhamantios korais reading `` to the citizens of the united states , it is your land that liberty has fixed her abode , so you will not assuredly imitate the culpable indifference or rather the long ingratitude of the europeans '' , going on to call for american intervention , in several american newspapers . 
  - [ george canning ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/george_canning ) was the architect of the treaty of london , which launched european intervention against the ottomans in the greek conflict . 
  - after the war [ ioannis capodistrias ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ioannis_kapodistrias ) was elected governor of greece . 
  he had served as foreign minister of the russian empire and was one of the most distinguished politicians and diplomats of europe . 
  while a conservative at home he championed liberalism in europe making him an enemy of [ klemens von metternich ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/klemens_von_metternich ) . 
  his first important mission , in november 1813 , was as unofficial russian ambassador to switzerland , with the task of helping disentangle the country from the french dominance imposed by napoleon . 
  he secured swiss unity , independence and neutrality , which were formally guaranteed by the great powers , and actively facilitated the initiation of a new federal constitution for the 19 cantons that were the component states of switzerland , with personal drafts . 
   trump , april 27 ** 2016 ** : yeap as i said earlier . 
  rhetoric is one thing . 
  policy is another . 
  especially pre elections rhetoric . 
  [ there is a plan ] ( http://news.err.ee/200723/baltic-presidents-meet-with-us-vice-president-pence ) . 
  the us is committed to nato . 
  well we ca n't talk hypothetically . 
  we better base our views on actions and not assumptions . 
   not doing anything while another country is invaded . 
  you talking about obama watching ukraine burn ? 
  because i am pretty sure the republicans were not in charge then . 
  republicans called for us military assistance . 
  rhetoric is one thing . 
  policy is another . 
   but maybe they 'll ask for more in return estonia already spends the agreed nato amount if i am not mistaken . 
  it has to considering the neighboring country . 
  the us will probably ask for more from germany . 
  you probably missed it but trump is president . 
  and he appointed j. mattis for secretary of defence . 
  the guy who supports permanent us troop presence in the baltics . 
   the us republicans , in general , do n't seem that keen on defending the baltics . 
  what ? 
  where did you pulled that out from ? 
  why not both ? 
  the far left in greece is considered normal for some weird reason so many people identify as that . 
  even if the opposition wins nothing changes in turkey . 
  the chp panders to nationalists everytime . 
  this is why i said that the people have to change . 
  and yes i agree that `` democracy 's biggest weakness are the people '' . 
  this is what happens when your system allows centralization of power . 
  this is why the first thing a free state must do is to make sure there is seperation of powers , really independent courts etc. 
  sadly it does n't work like that . 
  a big ( very big ) portion of the turkish people love him . 
  even if he goes the legacy will stay and other will try to live up to that legacy . 
  remember . 
  laws and states do n't change people . 
  if turks want change they have to change the general consensus of the people first . 
  think tanks , publications etc. 
  i would bet the sc would rule against them . 
  geopolitical dominance is really important for a country to let go so easily . 
  the us fought tooth and nail to expand across the continent and assure a strategic position against mexico and the brirish ( now canadians ) . 
  it 's all power politics . 
  they ca n't secede because of the 14th amendment . 
  by withdrawing from the union the state denies citizens the us rights that they get because they were born us subjects . 
  it is unconstitutional . 
  well this is one of my `` controversial '' views . 
  apparently anything pro-american is not viewed as good here . 
  many european are really arrogant thinking really low of the us . 
  i am a minority here being pro-usa . 
  i * really * admire the us . 
  and the federal government would laugh . 
  there is ** no ** way the federal government would ever allow secession to happen . 
  even if a referendum result was pro secession, 
  the us wo n't hold a referendum on nafta or nato or the un . 
  local refs on weed for instance is not as significant and important as national issues are . 
  in greece we had a stupid referendum on national policy almost two years ago . 
  that just does n't happen in the us . 
  debatable . 
   the fact that the constitution is hard to change also does not help the fact that things such as gerrymandering or the electoral college are still an issue . 
  the electoral college [ is needed ] ( http://imgur.com/a/unmtf ) in my opinion otherwise the country is ruled by ny and la. 
   you also mention in another comment that you prefer `` grand coalitions instead of the tyranny of the majority '' , which is fundamentally impossible to achieve in the 2 party system of the united states , due to the difficulty of constitutional change . 
  also the two party system is a grand coalition in itself . 
  the gop for instance is a party of conservatives , nationalists , libertarians , progressive conservatives , moderates etc. 
  the democrats are a party of progressives , liberals , moderate conservatives etc. 
  the people create the coalition within a party and then breed the center between the two parties . 
  i am a minority in this by i find that system far supierior to our multi party parliamentary system . 
  damn romans adopted parts of greek cultures and myths but did n't absorb our language . 
  this whole map could have been yellow . 
  the only european left using more greek words than it is appropriate is boris johnson ... 
  what does federalism has to do with this ? 
  state 's right you mean i suppose . 
  yes that is important . 
  but we are talking about national issues such as brexit . 
  the us does n't hold such kinds of referendums . 
   there are referendums in the us on state level . 
  not on national issues . 
  local referendums are irrelevant . 
   also switzerland holds referendums all the time and is one of the most successful countries on the planet . 
  switzerland is not successfull because of the referendums . 
  not to mention that switzerland in general is not your everyday country . 
   if anything the eu needs more democracy . 
  democracy is safer under the rule of law , stability and grand coalitions instead of the tyranny of the majority . 
  there is an in between area that works just fine . 
  [ professor dawkins put it nicely ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaysoifpusg ), 
   farage had already said he would call for a new one when he thought he had lost so yes people had called for another one . 
  that would be stupid too . 
  what 's your point ? 
  does n't matter if it is the remain or leave side .

  except many women can wear a burqua if they choose to do so . 
  no one coerces them . 
  it 's not a logical explanation , it 's an ultraconservative rationalization explanation . 
  those laws were made by very specific agendas , people , party support and panic spread by their owned media . 
  in many countries they were n't even a thing before the past decade . 
  quality affordable for the majority or quality affordable only for the businessmen that this site caters to ? 
  except when you feel that you have to proclaim in a public forum that you have been saying a thing for years , as if your opinion has any more weight than the rest of the average joes ' here . 
  then you come off as conceited . 
  you can not deport without processing and establishment of non-refugee status . 
  pesky western human rights , amirite ? 
  boogeyman putin is going to eat your children if you do not fall in line . 
   i 've been saying it for years . 
  and who are you , mr. self-proclaimed authority ? 
  how to gain the moral upper hand in the eyes of the electorate : handle mocking from stereotypical rich cunts with dignity . 
  if you mean that they are refusing or are unable to hold refugees because they are even more economically in despair that us greeks , that is called reality , not balls . 
  but i wish they would do it in a way that does n't send all the refugees back to us . 
  here they are ( or were , before anticorruption ) an excellent way to network . 
  and by `` network '' i mean `` minister , please hire my daughter/son as a permanent public employee , * she/he plastered the walls of the city with at least 1000 election campaign posters '' . 
  you do understand that you have these in the us too , right ? 
  they are n't an exclusive characteristic of a north korean dystopia . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/young_democrats_of_america https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/young_republicans, 
  we also voted our gay unions bill without it having adoption rights . 
  maybe the political capital is n't yet enough to go full radical ? 
  most leftists in europe make distinctions between the moderate right and the totalitarian far-right . 
  we are not yet in the completely batshit insane identity politics/third-wave feminism revival phase . 
  is it moral to ruin our country because you have too much of an ego to share the burden ? 
  losing any moral advantage we have towards ` evil ' totalitarian regimes , one step at a time . 
  you do n't need to be born at those times to have the same mentality . 
  just look at our own golden dawn idiots . 
  but you do advocate to deny those people a better life , just like their shitty same-religion `` brothers '' . 
  or maybe left wingers are protesting already for people being held in shelters and camps like cattle , and your argument and every other cheeky right winger 's here is a strawman . 
  maybe you are conditioned from years of ussr spanking to short-sell yourself to your new masters . 
  i am not . 
  common people are not paranoid activists , checking every single thing they download or using a computer for its own sake . 
  they want to use their computer to do a task ( office work , communications , games ) and be done with it . 
  an antivirus or related programs are a practical way to make a compromise between usability and security . 
  because i am not a nationalist idiot , playing right into putin 's hands . 
  false dilemma much ? 
  you can both lobby for immigrant policy change and stand up to russia perfectly fine . 
  just citizens exercising their ` freedom of speech ' . 
  i am the authority in a democracy . 
  the citizen . 
  i am not just ' a dude on the internet ' . 
  it 's an arms race between the antivirus companies ' researchers and the malware authors . 
  there is no malicious behavior from the researchers to justify calling it `` snake oil '' . 
  the reaction is political pressure towards the authorities to act according to the pressure . 
  without reaction , or a counter-reaction that supports the lax treatment , the authorities do not have the political capital to proceed with the application of the law . 
  you see this pattern all over history . 
  things that the government should have done for the national interest failed because the people did n't support it . 
  compare the unpopular vietnam war vs the popular past-9 / 11 military interventions . 
  if you treat foreign spies lax , it sends a message to the wannabe-spies that spying is beneficial and the consequences if caught are worth it . 
  any ( non-conspiratard ) sources about all these ? 
  it sure tells a lot about how secular and western this sub has become . 
  a honest person votes a government to do it for him so he does n't get his hands dirty . 
  it 's pretty long actually , we just have shitty managers and productivity . 
  are we putting the band back together ? 
  just patience and understand that it will probably never happen within our lifetime . 
  stop bullying germany-senpai ; _ ;, 
   tass because i like taking my anti-eu propaganda right from the source . 
  i am pretty sure that russia would level 10 blocks more . 
  so no . 
  we were just amateurs in hiding our cheating , internalizing the anti-corruption german bullshit too much . 
  it was a us institution that helped us cover our cheating in the first place . 
  morality and anti-corruption my ass . 
  everyone accuses each other while everyone sits on a pile of bullshit . 
  free market , superior even in corruption .

  the biggest obstacle is that our formal it guys are 9 kilometers away , overworked having to tend to hundreds of old workstations with zero budget . 
  i find that being close and showing my coworkers a thing or two to do their jobs more efficiently is actually easy . 
  it just takes time , patience and reassurance to calm their panic down towards the ` new ' . 
  a better example would be [ oppenheimer ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/j._robert_oppenheimer ) . 
  he was persecuted relentlessly for his political position of sharing nuclear secrets . 
  i personally liked the change and wished for it to be transferred as an option in libre , since it seems that ms ca n't claim patent rights anymore . 
  for non-advanced users ( who click their way through everything instead of shortcuting it ) it indeed makes a difference . 
  plus it 's not ms exclusive ( thus ` morally bad ' according to the foss culture ) , it is a very old ui concept . 
  i disagree about the government part , especially in the municipality level ( personal experience ) . 
  usually the employees do rote work there , like entering data on spreadsheets , and do n't have advanced knowledge of them .

  basically , whoever came up with the idea of rs knew that there was absolutely no other way to build their ` serb ' republic without ethnic cleansing . 
  even if the bosniaks and croats had said `` sure go ahead , any region that wants to be part of your new country is free go leave bosnia '' , the serbs would * still * need to forcefully evict hundreds of thousands of non-serb before they could get a `` serb '' republic rather than a multi-ethnic one ... 
  the `` bosnian muslims '' who supposedly started the war , the people who wanted an independent bosnia-herzegovina , were n't even all muslims ( let alone islamists ) . 
  one quarter of their army was composed of ethnic serbs and croats . 
  the deputy commander of the bosnian army 's headquarters , was ( ethnic serb ) general jovan divjak . 
  general stjepan \u0160iber , an ethnic croat was the second deputy commander . 
  president izetbegovi\u0107 also appointed colonel bla\u017e kraljevi\u0107 , commander of the croatian defence forces in herzegovina , to be a member of bosnian army 's headquarters , seven days before kraljevi\u0107 's assassination , in order to assemble a multi-ethnic pro-bosnian defense front . 
  in short this is a shameless lie you just said . 
  when it was the serbs that wanted a religiously cleansed state with only orthodox allowed in it , and when it was the `` bosnian muslims '' that were striving for a country where all religions and ethnicities would be respected . 
   if they reject it now it will look like they 're being the emotional and irrational ones and that would n't look good . 
  my personal belief is that syriza is always doing the utmost it can to divide europe , no matter how good or bad this division is for greece . 
  the greek referendum 's main end-result was that the deadline at the end of june expired , and the new agreement will thus have to be ratified by national parliaments . 
  this makes it possible for some parliaments to pass it and others to reject it , causing division and accusation between european nations about who 's to blame for the grexit . 
  you are babbling . 
  the referendum was designed to be as meaningless as possible , so that it would n't constrain the government no matter what happened . 
  a referendum about an invalid proposal . 
  the no side sometimes said it was a referendum about our dignity , sometimes a referendum about this specific proposal , sometimes a referendum that would somehow strengthen greece 's negotiating position , sometimes a referendum against the old political establishment and the media moguls . 
  this ludicrous undemocratic charade with the pretense at democracy as a pr stunt is frankly emblematic of the whole syriza thingy . 
  the one thing the referendum succeeded in doing is cause enough delay to cause the expiration of the 2nd memorandum , thus needing the 3rd one to be approved by the national parliaments of countries we have already angered like germany for calling them nazis or the baltics for supporting putin . 
  at this point i do n't believe syriza wants to keep greece in the euro . 
  it just wants to do everything it can to blame the grexit on the evil europeans , preferably even from the europeans own perspective , so that europe would be divided with accusations regarding who is to blame for the suffering on the greek people that the grexit caused . 
  the prime minister when `` greece was the recklessly spending and lying about its budget '' was [ kostas karamanlis ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kostas_karamanlis ) . 
  tsipras chose one of the closest associates of kostas karamanlis in those years ( [ prokopis pavlopoulos ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/prokopis_pavlopoulos ) ) as president of the greek republic , and it is rumored that he would have picked kostas karamanlis himself except that karamanlis himself refused it . 
  ( tsipras has denied this , but he himself said that he and karamanlis have `` mutual respect '' for each other ) the current `` investigative committee '' examining the conditions of our country 's entry in the memorandum , has considered out of its jurisdiction the entirety of kostas karamanlis ' term in office . 
  to me these are most unexplainable unless you see syriza as just another aspect of the establishment that was in power back then too , doing its utmost to shelter and protect kostas karamanlis and his associates . 
   i would have created separate categories for previous greek governments and current greek government to make the question more accurate . 
  then you 'd also have to add a category for `` both the previous greek governments and the current one '' . 
  because that 's the choice i 'd pick . 
   i still do n't know why politicians who were power back than are n't in jail . 
  they 're part of the same political establishment . 
  to say `` the people running greece now were no where near power '' is a oversimplification . 
  syriza may not have been the governing party before this year , but you can be sure that even when it was in the opposition it helped contribute in the de-industrialization of greece , and that it did n't push ( or it pushed against ) the reforms that needed to be done . 
  the pretense that '' \u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03bc\u03bf\u03ba\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03af\u03b1 '' can be translated to `` fearmongering '' should stop . 
  it 's properly translated to `` terrorism '' . 
  `` fearmongering '' is probably what '' \u03ba\u03b9\u03bd\u03b4\u03c5\u03bd\u03bf\u03bb\u03bf\u03b3\u03af\u03b1 '' would be translated as . 
  `` terrorizing '' is what '' \u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03bc\u03bf\u03ba\u03c1\u03ac\u03c4\u03b7\u03c3\u03b7 '' would be translated as . 
  `` terrorism '' is the one and only proper translation of '' \u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03bc\u03bf\u03ba\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03af\u03b1 '' . 
  no , he said they are terrorists . 
   anyway what are we talking about you are defending the people that raped greece for 40 years when did i defend anyone like that ? 
  perhaps you should stop trying to be cute , and start trying to communicate . 
   you come and you say this stuff here . 
  shame . 
  russophile communists ... 
  the wall fell , my boy , 25 years ago . 
  yes , the wall fell 25 years ago . 
  so what ? 
  their russophilia is undeniable . 
  their foreign minister has been a pal of alexander dugin . 
  they 've clearly supported all of russia 's actions in ukraine . 
  neither them nor their coalition partners have ever once criticized russia about anything whatsoever . 
  ( seriously i dare you to find a single comment ever by syriza or anel which is even slightly critical of russia or any action russia has ever done ) `` puppets of the kremlin '' is frankly closer to my estimation of them than `` russophiles '' , but i obviously do n't have proof for the former . 
  russophilia is the * polite * interpretation of their actions , far better than `` traitors of their homeland in the kremlin 's pocket '' . 
  as for communism , tsipras belonged to the communist youth of greece . 
   greece could have , and probably should have , left both the eurozone and the eu years ago . 
  but that would 've mainly hurt the eu and done basically no damage to greece . 
  you have it the other way around . 
   russophile communists you are hopefully aware that syriza is practically the definition of `` russophile communists '' ? 
  or at least `` russophile far-radical leftists '' though they do also have explicit communists in their midst . 
  as for russophile , not just the current greek government but previous ones have also been russophile . 
  ( see http://www.ecfr.eu/publications/summary/a_power_audit_of_eu_russia_relations , a 2007 publication where greece is called russia 's `` trojan horse '' inside the eu , by the ecfr )  if britain said end the privilege of the catholic church to ireland , northern ireland would 've been on fire that evening . 
  if germany said end the privilege of islam in the balkan peninsula to turkey ... i dread to think what would happen . 
  it 's not northern ireland or turkey that has claimed the only way to pay its debts , is if its debts were cut , and that it has no possibly way of fixing its budget deficit without such , when the ultra-wealthy orthodox church is right there getting ludicrous tax breaks and having all its priests paid their salaries by the government . 
  it 's greece that is going to the eu begging for money , while at the same time insulting them . 
  so please shut up . 
  all that verhofstadt said greece needed to do were the things it ought have done by itself , without anyone prompting it . 
   they kept attacking the one guy who was trying to get the economy of greece back on its feet can you explain what makes you think tsipras is trying to get the economy of greece back on its feet ? 
  in fact , if he was trying the exact opposite , if we was trying to finish off all that remained of the greek economy , what more could he have possibly done ? 
  the above is a serious question , please explain what worse he could have done . 
   kick one of your allies when he is down until he is in putin hands . 
  bullshit , in 2007 ecfr had already described greece as being russia 's `` trojan horse '' inside the eu . 
  ( http://www.ecfr.eu/publications/summary/a_power_audit_of_eu_russia_relations ) greece was already acting as russia 's pawn , using its veto power to further russian goals . 
  in short , greece and the government of kostas karamanlis that 's primarily responsible for greece 's humongous debt expansion was * already * in putin 's hands , before the crisis even . 
  that russia-obedient government was the primary cause of the greek economy crisis . 
  now , the willing lackeys of russia ( like the governing coalition of syriza-anel ) use the big bad europeans to pretend that this is why they 're making sweet eyes towards russia . 
  but of course , they individually had * all * been supporters of russia , long before the crisis occurred too . 
  we can examine their personal history to see if they ever criticized russia about anything , or if they had always been `` russia is awesome , putin is awesome '' instead . 
  ( hint , it 's the latter ) again we have a reversal of cause and effect by syriza . 
  it 's not that they 're going to putin because of the bad europeans are causing the negotiations to fail . 
  rather syriza was already in putin 's hands , and that 's why syriza wants to present the europeans as bad , and wants the negotiations with the europeans to fail ... 
   but syriza presented countless of plans , they are simply being refused by troika , like the one where they found cuts without lowering wages and troika discarded it because they wanted wages to be cut , just like that . 
  `` like the one '' ? 
  i only remember that one . 
  do you have any other ? 
  and yes troika rejected it , because of its extreme and unreliable reliance on gains-via-taxation with no significant reforms or budget cuts . 
  the troika are n't masochists or sadists , they would like greece to get a functioning economy so that greece can eventually repay them . 
  they did n't believe syriza 's ( single ) plan would work . 
  if they believed it would work , they would have accepted it . 
  now where 's all the `` countless '' other plans ? 
   fun fact , the greek economy was growing much faster before we joined the eu . 
  that 's not the difference between a eu and a non-eu country , it 's the difference between a pro-western politician like konstantinos karamanlis ( the 1st ) who got us into the eu , and a pro-soviet politician like andreas papandreou who just grabbed the eu 's money afterwards and installed a soviet-style nomenklatura . 
   nd , former pasok and potami mainly . 
  so the two parties that bled greece to death and one controlled by the biggest media mogul . 
  right . 
  as compared to syriza , anel , and golden dawn , who worship the ground that putin walks on , have all supported his aggression against ukraine , are best pals and penpals with alexander dugin , and all take their orders directly from the russian embassy . 
  oh , and one of them are a bunch of neonazis , while another one is the best friend of all leftist terrorists , and the remaining one is led by an antisemite . 
  see , i can insult the `` no '' parties too . 
   on one hand you blame the no people for the germanotsolias rhetoric , on the other you do the same thing with the `` damn commies '' `` neonazis '' rhetoric . 
  irony much ? 
  i never said `` damn commies '' and are you seriously denying that golden dawn are neonazis ? 
  seriously ?

  google them . 
  i bet he has : all the articles on white terrorists are painted exactly that way . 
  for too long trains have provided shelter and passage to criminals . 
  this ends today . 
   this money is payed at the eu directly and from the eu , without the obligation to pay back . 
  again , they 're loans . 
  the only gain for gr ( or any receiver of such loans ) is the discrepancy between the present value of a loan and the future value at the time of maturity ( plus interest , of course ) . 
  nobody transfers money to the eu . 
  the ez is not a transfer union .

  what is the right amount of seriousness , do you think ? 
  i think subsidies are ok , the method of distribution needs some more scrutiny , however . 
  what i mean by that is subsidies need to be allocated on a necessity basis rather than harvested area alone ( as was the case in the past , or still is in some countries ) . 
  of course , it is more difficult to ascertain necessity and need among farmers individually , but there still needs to be a sweet spot for the tradeoff between gains from eliminating corruption and spending to audit subsidised farmers . 
  literally _ anybody _ can be a politician . 
  now there 's an interesting article . 
  i like that people are considering food redistribution this way . 
  i wonder what kind of incentives this gives to supermarkets & bakeries . 
  greece should be '' \u03b8\u03b7\u03bb\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc '' alone , '' \u03b6\u03ce\u03bf '' means ` animal ' .

   the majority of people is already pissed of by brussels , if they propose something like a central europe goverment and an united states of europe concept we 're in for civil war . 
   stop the fud , geez . 
  nobody 's going to war over a proposal . 
  attracting voters means an increase in the number of voters for a party , which i 'm pretty sure is nearly synonymous with growing . . maybe you wanted to argue that even though one votes for a nationalist party , he is not a nationalist , which would be a pretty fun read for a sunday . 
  so what you 're saying is it 's not ( skin colour ) discrimination , it 's ( religious ) discrimination . 
  albanians ( and serbs , croatians , bulgarians , romanians ) have integrated just fine , thank you .

  which also does n't include a translation .

  a healthy culture would react by trying to `` win back '' its disenfranchised members by solidarity and support . 
  but you , being greek , react by kicking dissenters even further away . 
  its how you were brought up , its what you are . 
  you ca n't help it . 
  i just hope this negativity i allegedly help spread ( lol its just a stupid , meaningless conversation in a sub of questionable quality ) burns so bright that it destroys our culture completely . 
  we are dying from cancer and you are talking about morale . 
  total denial . 
  you are talking pure ideology . 
  i agree that it sounds nice in theory , in some utopian world maybe , but reality has demonstrated that the exact opposite is true : we need moderation to keep it together . 
  i am not sure about the why or how , but it is what it is . 
  even heavy moderation is not bad as long as its * transparent * , like if you know what is going on and why , if you are given reasons for the actions of the moderators and can understand their decisions . 
  no not really , it means we are an extremely polarized sub where few civilized discussions can take place . 
  only a troll would like such a situation . 
  i hope so , because then their complaining will stop . 
  but i would n't be so optimistic . 
  great comment . 
  i wish all the upvotes flock to you , sir . 
  i agree completely . 
  of course , we ca n't do that , because there is a large number of religious * christian * conservatives lying around . 
  they would never allow for this . 
  do n't let reddit fool you . 
  europe is not some kind of perfect secular liberal utopia as the anti-muslim crowd wants you to believe . 
  they are simply saying this to pretend that muslims are incompatible with europe when some extreme nationalist parties are just as incompatible , if not more . 
  code for `` let the muslims secularize first , we 'll keep our christianity for now '', 
  what exactly do you think will happen ? 
  i find a disturbing lack of nationalist outrage about this . 
  will no one complain about the pc brigade ? 
  no one to complain that he is being labelled a `` racist '' by the multicultural leftists , in an attempt to silence his proud nationalist voice ? 
  come on !, 
  salah abdeslam is clearly an intelligent muslim who represents all muslims perfectly and also interprets his religion 100 % correctly . 
  in contrast to , say , anders breivik who was just a crazy idiot who totally misinterpreted christianity and nationalism !, 
  exactly , so you agree with them . 
  your comment  i think it would be pretty naive to dismiss that probability was n't really valid because no one is dismissing any probabilities . 
  neither me nor you . 
  especially you , because you are not talking about probabilities but certainties . 
  i can grant you any probability you want , but the point remains , that 's is disgusting how easily people are swayed by the media ** as long as it fits their preconceived notions ** . 
  the disgusting part is that the same people think they are some kind of intelligent anti-pc media-critical skeptics . 
  sadly they are not . 
   i 'm actually saying the opposite : the immigrants should absolutely not be provided with any amount of money that exceeds the amount of money given to regular citizens of a given country . 
  well there is too much difference between us . 
  your starting point is some ideological position which i do n't share . 
  i tried to explain how reality is and why such things are acceptable . 
  why pensioners and refugees are receiving whatever it is they are receiving . 
  there are rational reasons for this . 
  good reasons that are fair and make sense . 
  but you seem set to oppose it on ideological grounds , so no matter what i say , it wo n't affect you . 
  at least this is my understanding . 
  by the way , i should point out that you are still under the misapprehension that bulgaria is giving 500 $ to each refugee and 150 $ to each pensioner . 
  this is a ridiculous idea and any conclusions drawn from it will be just as ridiculous , if not more . 
  pensioners obviously receive more from their government and will keep receiving until they die , as they should . 
  refugees very limited accommodations for a limited amount of time , which may very be cut short . 
  their doom is but one `` bad '' electoral results away . 
  i think i already mentioned arguments of that sort but ideology is ideology ...  i do n't think greeks get to make clever comments about the state of other countries right now , sorry xd we totally get to , if we are clever enough  feel free to try to make similar comments about greece , i welcome witty remarks , if you can make them . 
  but that is what the greek population wants to hear . 
  its the only language we understand . 
  you do n't talk to greek people like normal human beings . 
  you make noises towards them like they are fucking wild animals that must be either appeased or scared away . 
  so `` no shit '' means `` not dismissing that probability '' ? 
  it does n't . 
  you agreed with the media and the us official . 
  i did n't call you a racist , i did n't say you are anti-immigration , it does n't matter really . 
  do n't take it personally . 
  its clear that this sub is extremely critical against media ( and other sources ) who do n't have a negative view towards refugees and/or muslims in general . 
  on the other hand , any media that advances the anti-migrant agenda is ** immediately ** met with praise . 
  even us officials , of all fucking people . 
  its like we totally forgot the bush era . 
   i get it , but the percentage of real refugees needing help is too small for me to care . 
  what would that % be ? 
  out of what number ? 
   let the bored rich people of the west worry about saving everyone on the other side of the planet . 
  fair enough . 
  they are probably paying for it anyway , its not like they are taking your money . 
  yeah that is why i said `` i am talking about the honest ones here '' . 
  maybe i was n't clear . 
  what i said applies only to the actual refugees . 
  but still the topic has nothing to do with illegal immigration so i guess you have another agenda here ? 
  anyway if they are lying , the amount they receive does not matter , even if its less than your pensioners , because they do n't deserve it . 
  i find your trust in politicians and media disturbing . 
  seriously though its funny ( and kind of sad ) how this sub immediately agrees with any anti-muslim news article . 
  any other kind of opinion , any opinion that is n't totally anti-muslim or anti-refugee is met with unrelenting cynicism . 
  like the media are full of lies and propaganda , the politicians hate and deceive you , do n't trust anyone etc. 
   why ca n't we be equal ? 
  because they are fleeing for their lives ( talking about the honest ones here ) and a bulgarian pensioner has a pension , healthcare , family , support network , legal rights etc basically a bunch of stuff that you get by default , stuff which a refugee will never have . 
  so you will always be more equal than him or her . 
  which is obviously correct , because you are the native citizens after all . 
  absolutely everyone in the eu has it better than the refugees , even the poorer bulgarian . 
  the opportunities you are given just by being in the eu and being allowed to travel and work here are amazing . 
  not to mention the funds you receive - which are conveniently forgotten in this narrative . 
  sadly , everyone thinks he has it worse than everyone else . 
  the grass is always greener !, 
  fleeing from your home and family is considered a privileged position in this schizophrenic sub . 
  and many greeks too rage on about the refugees have it `` better '' , its not the first time i 've heard this , its depressingly common for poor countries to hate downwards .

  well , in the same fashion , what you are doing is just as bad . 
  also its weird to complain about american cnn in / r/europe but have fun i guess ? 
  people used to argue that slavery was a long time ago , get over it etc. 
  that was centuries ago . 
  now the bar has dropped to 20 years ? 
  what 's next , the war was 1 year ago , get over it ? 
  do n't trust the media or the politicians !,

  i only take offense at the `` everyone '' must help part . 
  if sweden wants to take a billion refugees per month , they are welcome to do so . 
  that is a shitty way to begin a debate jews are compatible with western culture middle east christians who are being murdered and tortured every day for being peaceful christians are 100 % compatible with european society . 
  i would not mind syrian christians or egyptian christians in greece, 
  first greece is in the eu second there is no such thing as `` welfare '' these so called `` bailouts '' are high interest loans which germany/france/etc has already [ profited billions off of ] ( http://www.dw.de/german-bank-bailout-fund-posts-first-ever-full-year-profit/a-16809503 ) and will for the next century or more third , i do not give a shit if sweden imports a billion `` refugees '' , that is your problem alone and there will be no `` sharing '' of this burden . 
  that is not a reason for us to do anything . 
  the middle east chaos is not our problem and there is absolutely no reason to take in 1 refugee let alone millions . 
  you swedes are going to have to find out the hard way what islam brings in the long run , you will make a good example at least to the rest of europe . 
  i would have no issues with saving the middle east/indian/pakistani christians who are being brutally murdered and tortured every day for being christian though , is n't that funny ? 
  we import the most intolerant people on earth because of `` muh guilt '' but they will kill any christian who does not bend the knee to islam, 
   everyone must help why ? 
  [ after christmas , it will be possible for prosecutors to take criminal action against swedes who criticize immigrants or people in authority online after a constitutional committee 's report on the matter has been voted in parliament , seen in a letter from the parliamentary offices .

  parts of london look like pakistan islamic state kingdom i do agree with you though that at the very least there is a very open debate about immigration in uk and the harmful effects about it . 
  in sweden , to just mention the fact that immigration might be a bit to extreme will get you hunted down by the media and politicians . 
  there is a form of leftist fascism that arose in sweden that prevents any discussion because it might hurt someones feelings . 
  i also love how sweden gets voted # 1 every year in `` press freedom '' !, 
  always makes me chuckle a bit, 
  do you think spanish government 's recent purchase of 1 billion $ of riot gear is in preparation for the upcoming street riots in catalan ? 
  what do you think is the worst case scenario ? 
  catalan 's have their own language and culture, 
  and england, 
  leftists will refuse to understand this , they will ignore it and continue shouting raysis at the top of their lungs, 
  well the greek people have the lowest house-hold debt in the western world , so there is no debt to pay for us . 
  the government on the other hand has tons of ( public ) debt , 300 billion , which will likely be paid off with the gas/oil wealth 2020 + . 
  also political system is infinitely better than pre-2008 so not sure where that came from .

  that number is inflated since many people work small `` odd-jobs '' that change weekly/daily , but it is still an extremely high number so i understand . 
  i do n't think that should be used as key factor to define an economy/country though . 
  i can use this [ suicide list ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_suicide_rate ) to show how greece has lowest suicide rate in the western world while many wealthy northern countries have the highest to `` prove '' how great greece is , but there are many factors and `` lists '' to put something into perspective .

  still though , can you stop using greece as an example of `` doom '' when it is even today one of the wealthiest countries in europe , after a great depression not seen since the 1920 's !, 
  depressing weather + no sun can make people really angry/on edge , especially fucking snow . 
  in greece the strong sun and calm sea has a healing effect on soul and body which is why i think so many people return every year, 
  eh , scotland gdp per capita 16,000 $ greek gdp per capita 22,000 $ how pathetic do you have to be to think becoming greece is a bad thing when you still are not even close to there ? 
  your country has been held up by the uk and is the only reason you are not the moldova of the north . 
  polish people have a steel outer shell with a soft soul from my experience . 
  lots of greeks are like that also, 
  spend one day in nyc and oslo will look like a different planet, 
  awesome , did you learn greek while there ? 
  if so , how difficult was it for you ? 
  the minds of pro-russians is the only thing that matters to the russian propaganda machine , they do not care what any outsider thinks . 
  the build up to east ukraine `` rebellion '' was a masterful and extremely well produced propaganda campaign aimed at convincing russians it was the right thing to do, 
  which is why i hope socialists never ever gain power again in greece , they had control from 80 's -2008 and created the mess and the socialist pasok party basically disintegrated . 
  now syriza socialists scum will come and do the same thing if they win next election , while current center-right party has been rebuilding . 
  that was a really huge mistake . 
  nokia should have been what galaxy is for android, 
  when mccain and victoria nuland appeared at maidan , that was a huge anti-west propaganda source to feed ethnic russians in east ukraine . 
  they used that and especially those pictures and videos to create a massive anti-maidan propaganda campaign in eastern ukraine . 
  when maidan won , everyone in east saw it as an american operation due to this and that 's when anti-maidan protests began,

  if you are going to be a separatist you need a very powerful flag with symbols of war/conquering etc , look at the donetsk/lugansk flags full of empire symbols and phrases or the confederate inspired novorossiya flag . 
  you cant just repaint the current flag of a country and expect to be taken seriously, 
  [ no , very serious !, 
  i find it is mostly older brits/scots who seek out uk pubs and other british oriented places in greece , which is understandable since older people are more content to just want to relax than explore . 
  youth really do like exploring and seeking adventure though or just going crazy in nightclubs which is normal, 
  in greece , any street with lots of `` uk pubs '' and things like that , i never understood why anyone would come to greece just to go to a traditional style uk pub , but many do that . 
  besides that , greece is an open place to explore , tons of hidden gems, 
  last time this happened was in anticipation of a leak of the foreign minister ( now president ) davotuglu organizing a false flag attack on syria to initiate a turkish/syrian war . 
  wonder what it will be this time, 
  * rubs hands together violently *, 
  poland received 300 billion $ from eu of actual charity money , no `` bailout '' loan bullshit . 
  that is larger than the `` bailouts '' of greece , spain , portugal and ireland combined and they must pay every dime back with usury levels of interest which poland does not .

  [ if trends continue , the number of non-believers is set to overtake the number of christians by 2030 . 
  in the last six years , the number of muslims has surged by 37 per cent to 2.6 million ; hindus by 43 per cent and buddhists by 74 per cent . 
  but the number of sikhs and jewish believers fell slightly . 
  ] ( http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2109488/2030-the-year-britain-cease-chrsitian-nation-march-secularism.html ) you will obviously not accept this source/claim , but just do n't act surprised when it actually does happen, 
  germany is pure at heart and can never do wrong , i do not like your insinuations of my beloved german people . 
  islam will also be the largest religion in uk in 20 years . 
  maybe scotland wants to avoid that mess ? 
  wars are never fought for irrelevant reasons , except for murica, 
  its an amazing deal , especially when you consider greece already has the best tank force in europe with hundreds of leo 2 a6/leo 2 hel ( modified built in greece leo 2 a6 ) [ leo 2 hel ] ( http://youtu.be/vmtwps9ah-u?t=24s ) 1,000 + modern tanks is ridiculous for a country the size of greece but i am not complaining especially with the 400 free m1a1, 
  you are acting like `` bailout '' is some kind of charity you dunce . 
  they are loans , extremely profitable usury level loans from germany which has already profited billions off them . 
  you are acting like a great depression worse than usa one in the 1920 's the last 6 tears was n't `` punishment '' enough chill out mehmet, 
  which tanks was that ? 
  the 400 m1a1 abrams deal was 400 free m1a1 tanks for greece non-lethal supporting role in iraq/afghan wars for allied countries . 
  greece only has to pay 150 million $ to get m1a1 refurbished as brand new which is an amazing deal for 400 tanks like that . 
  greece gdp/capita is still 22,000 $ which is pretty decent compared to the region besides italy which has 26,000 $ gdp/capita to put it into perspective russia gdp/capita is 15,000 and ukraine is 3,000 $ gdp/capita,

   if greece said that they will not let the refugees out officially that is our stance . 
  our gov ` ts stance is that we will not let anyone except those refugees who are to be relocated according to the eu refugee distribution out . 
  also if they apply for asylum in greece what do we earn ? 
  we 'll still have to feed , house , educate etc. 
  hundreds of thousands of people . 
   i think that would make at least afghans , iraqis and other non-syrians rethink their position . 
  iraqis are not economic migrants , unless you noticed , their nation is half-ruled by isis and plagued with terrorism and practical lawlessness and religious violence ever since they got a dose of explosive liberty \u2122 . 
  afghans come from a country much of whose non-urban areas are ruled by the taliban and whose major cities are constantly bombed by said taliban . 
  what exactly would motivate those people ( who do n't even have the means to go back home , even if they wanted to ) to `` change their minds '' ? 
  to them , a european slum is heaven . 
  so you agree with me ? 
  if you close the route people will keep coming anyway , as long as a war is going on . 
  the only difference is they 'll be stuck in an already unstable and half-ruined country , a fellow eu member , whom you 'll have to prop up with billions unless you want the refugees to riot and/or starve . 
  the only way the refugee flow will stop is if the war stops . 
  nations such as germany , france , the uk etc. 
  supplied the various combatants with weapons ( as a matter of fact they still do ) . 
  perhaps if they stopped throwing weapons in the pitch , stopped bombing syria and iraq and finally accepted that assad will rule syria whether they like it or not , the war could end and we could send them back . 
  but that would destroy the pride of many great european nations . 
  if you ask me they choice between pride and results is an obvious one ( since i guess you 're not interested in the moral aspect of the whole story , not very much unlike global leadership ) ; one can not have their pie and eat it too . 
  recovered with lots of us cash , not paying reparations to several nations and immense debt forgiveness , but indeed recovered . 
  how does that make them germanic and protestant ? 
  neither nation is a nation state with a defined religion and ethnicity ; they 're multicultural federations , calling the germanic and protestant is ignorant of their diversity . 
  also , most great canadian prime ministers ( p.e. 
  were french catholics , not english protestants and historically , up until very late in its existence , canada was a majority french catholic nation . 
  since when are finland , canada and australia germanic ? 
  since when is canada protestant ? 
  [ savage ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1qxqrpf08e ),

  how ` bout you show some morality and help member states in the refugee crisis * cough * greece * cough * and then you ask us to damage our own economy to help a non-member . 
  the same common sense that drove said gov ` ts to not give the greeks and italians helps or funds when we were asking for it btoh months before the crisis started and up to this point ? 
  i love how austria is openly talking about sabotaging another eu member to help a non-member and everyone 's ok with it but when a deal with turkey is proposed everyone objects for `` moral reasons '' . 
  my toilet paper has more morals than your average european politician ( or voter for that matter , seeing these reactions ) . 
  i love about how everyone is pissed about this supposed `` illegal greek government conspiracy '' when breaching the refugee distribution deal was just as ( if not more ) illegal . 
  did you honestly think they would n't find a way in ? 
  exactly . 
  hahahahhaa, 
  reminds me of [ this splendid little cartoon the ny times published a while back ] ( http://www.topontiki.gr/sites/default/files/article/2015-09/skitsonyt.jpg ) . 
  when i came to canada and met some other europeans i was shocked that they all had whatsapp . 
  in greece we just use text messaging , facebook , snapchat etc. , only one of my friends even had whatsapp . 
  lots of us have viber though and i ca n't really tell the difference . 
  -1 / 10 , would n't have joined at all if it was up to me , seeing how it 's worked out . 
  if it were democratic and more unified in spirit ( if we all saw ourselves as europeans first and our nationality second , instead of the other way around ) i would very much like it , but now it 's just a slightly evolved cartel . 
  might as well switch back to the original name ( ecsc ) . 
  they called us in , they did n't force us to join in . 
  yes , i shall start by removing all spartans , then i shall take sicily by storm !, 
  edit : my spelling sucks, 
  i am !, 
  i shall change my name to donaldos trympocles and i 'm going to make a wall and have the corinthians pay for it !, 
  now that sounds like a totally legit system does n't it ? 
  by that logic greece and italy would be above criticism in all political matters ... and we certainly ai n't . 
  i 'd take cypriot rule over german rule any day ... promarily because it would n't actually involve being ruled xd, 
  of course the americans are n't going to get their hands dirty for europe 's big 3 to make free money and keep the moral high ground . 
  iraq , afghanistan , libya , all of these conflicts furthered or protected european interests as well as american ones , yet everyone ( many eu gov ` ts included ) put all the blame for these catastrophies onto the americans . 
  so they 're pretty much telling the big euro countries ` you wan na make money by exploiting syria ? 
  i ai n't getting another pr downgrade and a wedge shoved in my relations with russia for you lot . '', 
  completely reasonable by me . 
  greek antiquities are in a tragic state . 
  then again when there are children in your country who faint from starvation , you have to get some priorities . 
  cypriot roman empire ... 
  i do believe that happened once . 
  trump called , he does n't give a damn . 
  rofl true enough, 
  first of all if we keep everyone in terrible conditions they will keep rioting and we might even have people dying on our hands . 
  secondly , we can not deport them to turkey , turkey will never allow that . 
  thirdly even after the corridor closed , in a couple of weeks their number has doubled . 
  i agree with your last point , but we should have thought of that when we used immigrants to replace our faltering populations instead of enforcing measures to boost our birth rates . 
  what 's with all the chania posts recently ? 
  are the cretans secretely taking over europe ? 
  tourism ? 
  well we have lots of terrible neighbours to compensate xd i mean literally one of them has an active casus belli on us , another recently tried to claim our lands and another is teaching their children that our northern provinces are rightfully theirs . 
  hey at least that 's only southern italy . 
  in greece it 's all of us . 
  where else would we use them ? 
  once they 're on shore ? 
  and exactly how does stranding 100,000 refugees on our soil prevent the rest from coming ? 
  i 'm telling you for the third time that i 've already accepted that , so i do n't see why you feel the need to reitarate it . 
  [ god is a serb ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-eqja8ahac ) , indeed . 
  oh , ok , thanks for the heads up . 
   greece/macedonia =  not schengen ( since macedonia is not an eu country ) maybe i misunderstood ? 
  greece is in the schengen area , check a map mate ... 
   we can handpick those from middle eastern refugee camps , in a regulated manner . 
  agreed , but i was refering to those already in greece , serbia etc. 
   i sympathise but that doesnt give you the right to dump the migrants on the rest of europe . 
  a sovereign country should be able to secure its own borders . . we do n't dump them mate , it 's not like we 're trying to send them over , they 're doing that on their own . 
  also when all of us joined the eu and schengen we gave up some of our sovereingty , unilateral border controls between us are one of those . 
  without wanting to sound agressive , if you truly consider border control such an important aspect of your sovereingty , perhaps you should consider leaving the eu and schengen . 
   because if someone 's a refugee there 's a high chance that they did n't have time or the opportunity to pack their things , appropriate documents etc before running to save their lives ? 
  well if my home was getting bombed i would be less concerned with packing my stuff and more concerned with running . 
  i mean look at [ this ] ( http://cdn.timesofisrael.com/uploads/2012/10/mideast-syria-cost-of_horo.jpg ) ; i doubt you 'd find much to pack in those homes , provided you 're still alive if you used to live in one of them . 
  indeed . 
  back then we had plentiful us cash , the far right was non-existent ( for obvious reasons ) and it was mostly fellow white europeans , so nobody had much of a problem with it . 
  that 's true , but you have to look at it from the point of view of the unhrc . 
  if it was the other way around everyone would deny even real refugees being refugees ( which many eastern european nations are doing anyway , imagine what would happen without that law ) . 
  many refugees have to leave in chaos so they lack such proof , though your idea of basic knowledge of their home country is splendid . 
  however personnally interviewing or even testing so many people is so costly and time consuming it 's practically impossible within the available timeframe . 
  do n't get angry on me mate , relax . 
  i 'm just saying i admit that you 're good kebab removers , but you created the need to remove said kebab in in the first place . 
  how are you better off with 100,000 refugees on your soil that you ca n't support and with everyone else casually working with non-eu members against you to breach eu rules , with no punishment ? 
  oh so we throw tear gas on people who 're on an overloaded boat and force them to drown ?

  they * are n't needed anywhere * . 
  they have no skills , no background checks and we have no idea if they are even vaccinated or carry dangerous diseases . 
  they can be former isis members , murderers who escaped prison after the regime collapsed etc. 
  who on earth would hire these people ( with our very limited jobs ) over locals or even immigrants who have migrated here properly . 
  the only reason illegals ever get any work is because they are willing to work for almost nothing , thus dropping the market value of unskilled labour ( and thus the income of the poorest people ) even lower . 
  look , i understand humanism but we all need to calibrate our ideas to reality . 
  the reality is these people are n't needed or wanted . 
  work with that . 
  find a solution based around that fact . 
  i might disagree with the end result of the thought process but at least it would have a basis in reality . 
  er ... i am not . 
  i am saying it was n't something extraordinary . 
  bulgarians did it to greeks when they got independence . 
  greeks did it to the turks in multiple occasions and during the exchange . 
  turks did it to greeks etc. 
  i am not saying it was justified . 
  i am saying it was so common that , if we were to claim this and that land based on 19th century population , every part of the balkans would belong to every nation in the balkans ( which , by the way , is why balkans tend to get violent ) . 
  no , there were bulgarians there . 
  the bulgarians lost the war and got expelled . 
  same thing happened to us when we lost the war . 
  it is how wars worked . 
  paionians were pretty damn badass . 
  they were n't slavic either ( they were thracians , who essentially got fully intergrated by greeks latter on ) but nobody would give a shit about claiming that name and fyrom is located exactly on top of the paionian land . 
  bah , this whole thing 's silly . 
  that pretty much sums up my opinion on this . 
  if they did n't go around saying how alexander was n't greek ( lel ) nobody would give a shit . 
  so i bet you support extreme punitive measures against turkey , international isolation and believe they are all fascist ? 
  if not , you are a hypocrite . 
  it absolutely is justified . 
  we have done it many many times with turkey . 
  we declared war and invaded turkey to liberate greek-majority territories . 
  if you believe our invasions were justified , why was n't the annexation of crimea ? 
  as for the rediculus russian propaganda ... who gives a flying fuck ? 
  there is equally rediculus ukrainian propaganda and suppression of the press . 
  it is always amusing seeing redditors go `` haha , look at those russians saying all ukrainians are fascist . 
  all russians are fascist ! '', 
  i mean that the us and britain has done far worse , even recently , and i do n't get 50 responses calling me a russian shill every time i say i do n't think the us is terrible . 
  as for the actual limits ? 
  i think annexing crimea , which is majority russian and was denied russian as a state language by the new ukranian government , was fully justified . 
  i think that arming rebels within ukraine is justified considering the west does exactly the same with the government openly . 
  i also do n't believe for a second that the coup government that oppresses opposition brutally in ukraine is particularly better than russia . 
  i am not pro-russia necessarily . 
  i am mostly anti-anti-russia . 
  i think putin exceeded his welcome and russia is headed to a dangerous territory . 
  i also think spamming russophobic propaganda and treating them like a bunch of vodka-fueled brutes does n't help . 
  the only opinion i hold that gets me constantly downvoted here is that russia is acting rationally and within proper limits in respect to threats to its sphere of control and putin is n't literally hitler . 
  immigration is a polarized issue . 
  not a consensus . 
  i am against immigration , but closer cooperation between eu countries is needed in regards to immigration . 
  the southern countries alone can not handle this huge wave , especially not now with the economic crisis and not when building a wall in the borders in consider an `` ethical violation '' which gets us sued . 
  europe needs to move its arse and build a proper , pan-european defence force against immigration that will turn back more of those boats . 
  unfortunately , once they get to europe , most of these immigrants destroy their passports . 
  partly they are encouraged to do that so the people that brought them over can control them easier . 
  partly because , without any id on them , they are un-expellable . 
  we ca n't expel them because a ) we do n't know where they come from for sure and b ) the countries they come from have probably no record keeping to verify on their end and wo n't accept them . 
  so at the very least , we need some sort of pan-european detention program that holds these immigrants and shares the weight . 
  greece made several camps at millions of euros in cost that the eu freaked over because they had like , fences to keep them in n ' stuff . 
  dude , he is naurgul . 
  i suppose you never met the guy before ? 
  as long as he does a good job , that is fine . 
   so they do n't consider themselves arvanites anymore ? 
  do they still speak albanian ? 
  a few will call themselves arvanites , but it is more of a `` community '' recognition . 
  in greece , local cultures are celebrated between us . 
  they are more of a mark of pride rather than anything divisive . 
  so the arvanites , cretans , moreans etc all keep some sort of identity and even people born in big cities will , most of the time , claim descent from some specific part of greece ( `` have a village '' ) outside of said big city . 
  tl ; dr : the arvanite identity is a fully greek identity right now , like with many many others . 
   really ? 
  what is being fanatical in greece mean ? 
  every sunday in church , strict fast during lent , memorizing large parts of the bibles and actively participating in the church communities etc they also tend to be conservative in church issues by eg opposing the separation of church and state . 
   are the arvanites completely assimilated by now ? 
  pretty much . 
  they have been indistinguishable from greeks for decades if not centuries . 
  many people of arvanite origins have been in power , ministers etc  source ? 
  none but personal experience . 
  also i tend to find most albanian converts are really fanatical about their faith . 
  recent immigration wave that started in the 90s . 
  arvanites are a whole different story . 
   also i was asking specifically about christian immigrants so unless the albanians who immigrated there are from the south and are orthodox i think you misread my question . 
  many albanians are christian or atheist when they arrive , most convert to christianity fairly soon ... so i think it qualifies . 
  til : lithuanians fucking hate gorbie . 
  i live in canada currently . 
  in greece , a few years ago , i lived on a few different places but most of my life in northern athens ( \u03a7\u03bf\u03bb\u03b1\u03c1\u03b3\u03cc , \u03b2\u03b1\u03c3\u03b9\u03ba\u03ac ) . 
  greece had a huge immigration wave from albania . 
  i am one of the few greeks that will openly admit to liking albanians , so keep that in mind . 
  in practice , albanians actively attempted , and succeeded , in intergrating to a very large degree . 
  the majority of albanians in greece today speak greek to various extends , have adopted greek names and lifestyle , never formed large ghettos and many have even adopted the religion . 
  i honestly see the albanians as a success story in regards to immigration * and * as a proof that an immigrant 's willingness to intergrate should be a big factor in today 's immigration . 
  i think it is telling that most 2nd and 3rd gen albanians are virtually indistinguishable from greeks and most of the times do n't even consider themselves albanians any more . 
  all in all 8/10 would let immigrate again . 
  i still feel restricting immigration from bulgaria and romania was a mistake . 
  ohhh , that is why poles appear drunk all the time . 
  it makes sense suddenly !, 
  so ... do we purge the mutant ? 
  lost cause in what way ? 
  it will be great today . 
  just woke up . 
  have n't had a proper easter since 4 years back . 
   but that is an attack on the politician in question who has gained a well-deserved and inarguable reputation for tyranny . 
  in what way was that even an attack on the politician ?

  we could if russia saw us more as a partner than an opponent . 
   why are so many people eager to support a terror-supporting country like turkey over russia ? 
  i 'm not sure * people * support that , but eu governments certainly do . 
  but that 's because russia has made it very clear that it 's interested in the weakening and division of the west , and it 's constantly trying to achieve it through various means ( like cyberwar and meddling with elections ) . 
  it 's very likely . 
  the ottomans were heavily inspired by byzantine architecture . 
  the [ blue mosque ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1e/sultan_ahmed_mosque.jpg/1024px-sultan_ahmed_mosque.jpg ) 's similarity to the [ hagia sophia ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/22/hagia_sophia_mars_2013.jpg/1280px-hagia_sophia_mars_2013.jpg ) is an evident example . 
  it refers to spain as a `` spanish lion '' , probably because you have one on your flag . 
  vive l'europe ~ ~ unie ~ ~ homosexuelle !, 
  the spanish anthem does n't mention anything to be exact . 
  ^ ^ :p but i knew what you meant ; i 've just always thought it weird to have a country 's national anthem swear loyalty to another country 's monarch . 
  you 'd expect the dutch government would 've changed it at some point after over 4 centuries of not being under spanish rule . 
  the greek national anthem also mentions several countries ( directly or indirectly ) , but not in the most commonly used first two stanzas ( the whole anthem has 158 stanzas , making it the longest national anthem by length of text ) . 
  these are : - usa ( the land of washington ) - spain ( the spanish lion ) - england - russia - italy ( the italian 's innards ) ^ ^ ew it also mentions europe . 
  do you want memelland ? 
  cause that 's how you get memelland . 
   the dutch anthem starts with `` william of nassau am i , of german blood '' ... 
  it also claims lifelong loyalty to the king of spain . 
  i 'm sure most of them want to reach the uk . 
  it 'd be interesting to see how brexiteers will deal with this post-brexit , when they wo n't be able to blame the eu for the spike in immigration . 
  there 's a lion facade at no26 ( next to a mini-lion ) and a lion statue at no32 . 
   this undermines the sense of having strongly shared history . 
  if anything , i think it reinforces it . 
  `` twelve days north of hopeless , and a few degrees south of freezing-to-death . '',

   sardinia is not among the regions with special autonomy ... wikipedia says [ it is ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/regions_of_italy#autonomous_regions_with_special_statute ) . 
  jesus , you 're such a good sport !, 
  we 're trying to start a franco-italian post war in this sub , and you thwart our mischievous plans constantly . 
  just be a proper frenchperson and display some arrogance already !, 
  the fact that so many countries down in the bottom of the list have self-reported data makes this a little sketchy . 
  usually it 's because they 're not part of the eu . 
  you 'll see that slovenia and croatia are usually included . 
  well , unless you live in a cardboard box , you * do * have the financial capacity to move out .

  real venn diagrams have curves !, 
  yeah , but that 's not the case in every other country . 
  civil partnership is `` marriage light '' in most cases . 
  well , the police could have certainly done more than gently nudge the bodyguards who were kicking downed protesters in the face . 
  well , it 's not like many gay couples are interested in marrying in a church in front of a priest . 
  they just want their union to be acknowledged by the state on an equal level with that of hetero-couples .

  strikes are n't nearly as common as you 'd think they 'd be in our situation . 
  russians are `` less slavic '' because of russia 's much greater expansion into traditionally non-slavic territories and the assimilation of native people into the dominant russian identity . 
  no other slavic-majority country ever achieved the reach russia has . 
  also , russification ( voluntary or not ) during the imperial and the soviet years of russia was extensive and lead to a substantial percentage of partially or fully non-ethnic russians self-identify as `` russian '' nowadays . 
  such things happened in other slavic countries as well , but not to the scale it did in russia . 
  genetically , yes . 
  they have , however , been slavic trendsetters for quite some time now . 
  when most non-slavic people think of a typical slav , it 's usually a russian . 
   like - who do you even support in syria ? 
  not isis . 
  that 's pretty much the only thing we all agree on . 
  actually , ' \u03b3\u03cd\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 ' is spelled [ \u029diros ] in ipa , since / \u03b3 / in ' \u03b3\u03ac\u03bb\u03b1 ' and / \u03b3 / in ' \u03b3\u03cd\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 ' are not the same sound .

   does anyone know if sicily still has nice weather in september ?

  the island 's mean temperature is in the 20s \u00b0 c during september ( warmer by the coast , slightly cooler inland ) .

   the ottomans stayed a neutral nation in the ww2 .

  median wealth , yes ( i 'm also shocked by this ) . 
  but mean wealth is 112,000 in greece vs 192,000 in germany . 
  you 're right . 
  the purges were mixed . 
  to be exact , the stalin regime 's purges and deportations affected mostly * non-russians * ( at least non-ethnic russians ) in the soviet union . 
  i 'm not surprised that this many modern ethnic russians do n't really care about it . 
  does the average japanese person care about the [ chinese ethnic cleansing of the 1930s/40s ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/three_alls_policy ) ? 
  does the average pakistani care about the [ 1971 bangladesh genocide ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1971_bangladesh_genocide ) ? 
  people tend to forget or not care about atrocities done to people outside their social/national group . 
  it 's not true for all instances ( e.g. , hitler and modern germans ) , but it 's very common . 
  at least it 's pretty low to make sense . 
  that 38 % of armenians , though , are [ criminally stupid ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/armenian_victims_of_the_great_purge ) . 
  good to know . 
   just do n't go there in mid summer , if you are not used to 35 + degrees ... and the obligatory horde of tourists . 
  i think montenegro is the likeliest at this point , though albania is n't too far off . 
  you 're right . 
  you * are * stupidly optimistic . 
   greece ca n't become a `` mediterranean tiger '' by investing on tourism . 
  we need infrastructure , high industrialisation , and good education to achieve such status . 
  we need a competitive economy , trading exports , low labour costs , an investment-friendly system , and incentives to not throw our most educated and skilled workers out of the window . 
  we currently have almost none of these things . 
  and , even if we manage to get there , do n't forget that the bubble might pop at any time , just like it did in ireland . 
  maybe i 'm too pessimistic , but i do n't trust my government and fellow countrymen to get us there anytime soon ... :(, 
  you have to keep in mind that there was no such thing as `` celts '' back then . 
  they were very different groups of people , having different cultures , with some ( but not all ) of them speaking related languages . 
  grouping them up under the term `` celts '' came from outsiders for simplification purposes . 
  you two stop tcheppening each other with this bubkes or i 'll potch your tuchas !,

  this must be the best comment here . 
  no matters what one feels about flags and unrecognized countries , the shit eurovision gets into is n't really worth anyone 's time . 
  greece sucks so fucking bad , its embarrassing . 
  these unemployment numbers , given how big and durable they are , have probably condemned a whole generation to mire in shit . 
  the greek response is to blame merkel , germany , the eu , the euro , the americans , even capitalism . 
  pretty much everyone else except ourselves . 
  and how can that be true , when literally everyone else is doing better ? 
  edit : except macedonia , yeah they are in the same shit as we are , what a great consolation ... 
  last time this temple bombing was mentioned , people here were raging because nationalists were allegedly blamed for the bombings . 
  yet nobody blamed any nationalists ( i think i saw one comment , that was heavily downvoted too ) . 
  so i am expecting a lot of rage at this perceived injustice . 
  * you dared blame the nationalists when it was filthy muslims who did this ? 
  * one again , nobody blame the right wing ( except the rare downvoted idiot ) but that wo n't prevent them from playing the victim card . 
  also , several posts of people complaining that they are being called `` racists '' and `` nazis '' when nothing like that happens . 
  prepare for the self-victimization party !, 
  interesting story . 
  i 've never heard of it , now i need to look it up , because it sounds very believable . 
  here is a well known but rarely mention fact : this modern greek identity is made up . 
  what we really are is the descendants of the citizens of the eastern roman empire . 
  everything in our culture , religion and language attests to that . 
  our so-called `` hellenic '' roots is bullshit and its totally made up by european romantics . 
  however , explaining the above to greek people provokes extreme anger . 
  well that 's better instead of repeating how non-special i am !, 
  i 'm glad we got past that . 
  you are not calling out the country 's problem . 
  what happened is that you got offended that i insulted greek people , and you felt the instinctive need to put me down . 
  it 's that simple really . 
  so i guess my original post applied 100 % to you , which is why you keep going at this . 
  i clearly hit a nerve . 
  its a good thing , receiving a dose of reality from time to time . 
  its even worse when it comes to my people , due to the complications of the greek nationality ( ancient hellenic , roman era , modern era ) . 
  its just a mess . 
  do n't try to make much sense of it just laugh , 
   this is such a blatant thievery and no one in eu will say a word about it because vucic is their most faithful `` partner '' in serbia . 
  why are you blaming the eu instead of your own country ? 
  i mean is * anything * not the eu 's fault nowadays ? 
   anatolia consisted of various greek cultures but they all identified being greek maybe you mean roman ? 
  except the western shores of anatolia , was there really much greekness to it ? 
  i imagine the people were known mostly for their religious and political ( imperial ) identity , rather having a pure ethnic greek one , whatever the hell `` greek '' meant in 900ad . 
  its funny to see this map , considering how much people rage at the prospect of demographical or national change . 
  note that christianity was n't totally established back then , for some parts of europe it was pretty much an invading religion . 
  there are some monarchists left in greece . 
  greek monarchy was an actual thing up until [ 1974 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/greek_republic_referendum,_1974 ) , when it was abolished . 
  as an institution , it was divisive and opportunistic . 
  there are still some tiny pockets of monarchists left in the countryside . 
  mostly religious fanatics and insane conservatives ( even for greek standards ) , some of them even hold on to old [ proto-fascist ideas ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/freethinkers%27_party ) . 
  they are not a political force of any importance and within one or two generations they will have disappeared completely . 
  as i see it , the commonwealth 's monarchy is an ancient , indigenous institution that is part of their culture and identity . 
  for greece , its a foreign concept , [ installed by the great powers ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/london_conference_of_1832 ) in an attempt to control the bunch of sheep-herding warlords that populated the early greek state . 
  once more , i am not here to exciting or unique or cool so as to entertain you . 
  being your special snowflake is not in my interest . 
  yet you keep repeating `` you 're not special !, 
  you 're not special ! '', 
  as if it matters . 
  that is why i asked you if you are an adult because you sound like someone obsessed with people being unique or different , which is n't usually an adult trait . 
  i do n't know what you tell you . 
  i expect you will respond with your usual `` you are not special !! '', 
  answer , to which i can just keep responding `` i do n't care , i am not here for your entertainment '' . 
  we can keep doing this forever , or you can just assume that will be my default answer from here onwards . 
  or , you can just grow up . 
  i grew up in greece ( unlike you maybe ? 
  do n't know ) and i have every right to feel the anger which stems from decades of the disgusting cultural , political and economical failure of my country . 
  deal with it . 
  accept it . 
  let it sink in , because you will keep hearing it . 
  i am not going to stop or change my attitude for your entertainment . 
  either downvote me , ignore me , or even talk to me as if you are an adult ( you 're not special !!, 
  you 're not different !! ), 
  or just ** move on with your life ** . 
  it 's your call really . 
   we must not be tolerant of the intolerant try saying that and being a liberal , people will bitch and moan about political correctness all day long . 
  what they want you to say is : * we must not be tolerate muslims * . 
  any other kind of intolerance ( e.g. 
  against far right wingers or nationalists ) is bad because of `` democracy '' and how are you not respect `` dissenting '' views ? 
  you forgot to complain about the pc brigade calling you a `` racist '' and thus silencing you . 
  depends . 
  if the perpetrators are muslims and/or immigrants , no . 
  if there were no muslims and/or immigrants involved , there obviously yes - there would be a shitload of people screaming about feminist hysteria promoting fake rape culture , hating men , the usual stuff . 
  but yeah now its muslims so lets taking groping seriously . 
  bunch of hypocrites . 
  likewise , i think you need to take a break from internet warfare where you see people calling you a `` nazi '' all the time . 
  you think you are winning and its sad , because all you do is troll . 
  your links . 
  first link , mentions that freedom party were former nazis who never underwent denazification as a party . 
  its true . 
  i am sorry if reality offends you , but its true . 
  that is what your fp\u00d6 heroes were . 
  second link is feynmann shit-talking about orban 's policies . 
  third link does n't even have the word nazi lol . 
  where are the crowds ? 
  keep moving the goalposts . 
  its pointless to ask for evidence because you 'll just keep goolging the word `` nazi '' and throwing links at me ( which you obviously do n't even read first ) ps : the `` are u mad bro ?!!? '', 
  shtick is silly , even for your standards . 
  [ read this ] ( http://europa.eu/about-eu/countries/member-countries/romania/index_en.htm ) . 
  maybe i did n't understand it correctly but does n't it say that you take way more than you put it ? 
   total eu spending in romania -- $ 5.944 billion  total romanian contribution to the eu budget -- $ 1.353 billion also why the fuck are you defending your nation ? 
  did i not make it clear that i am a liberal who does n't adopt these negative stereotypes ? 
  turn the clock back 10 or 20 years , ask any proud conservative all over europe what he thinks of romanians and if he calls you `` thieves '' consider yourself very lucky . 
  do n't flatter yourself . 
  it was the openess of the progressive european civilization that was a tremendous help to elevating your country .

  in reddit the civil war is presented as being solely the result of russian aggression . 
  that 's where i got that . 
  so are you saying ireland is n't the only country bordering a big country on the east and the atlantic ocean on the left ? 
  because everyone tries to hide the fact that there have been huge divisions in the ukrainian society , in order to present the donetsk situation as a result of just russian aggression . 
  just check the election results of svoboda in western ukraine , the results of the communist party in eastern ukraine , and vice versa . 
   a cultural divide within the country ehm ... that 's precisely what u/ramosspaceball 's post was meant to show . 
  there has been deep cultural , ethnic , political , religious divide in ukraine . 
  claiming this divide has been miraculously healed because poroshenko got 50 % in the last elections is short-sighted and wrong . 
   just another leader taking office . 
  poroshenko is exactly that . 
  he 's no outlier , he has been part of ukrainian 's political and economic elite for a lot of years . 
  if only the latest elections matter , then surely greece is allowed to not pay its debt . 
  we never had corrupt governments , we always voted for syriza !, 
  i agree . 
  but to be fair , there are like 5 countries in the whole world that have n't been invaded by britain at some point . 
  i see what you did there . . let me inform you we 've been enemies since at least [ 395 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/alaric_i ) !, 
  damn , it must be nice to only have * one * historical enemy . 
  lol this is going to get downvoted/ignored to oblivion . 
  yeah , let 's erase 25 years of history just because it does n't fit our narrative . 
  rip . 
  a hero . 
  also , many people forget that ussr , even though it had socialist economy and a single-party system , was still a human society and as such had actual criminals in it . 
  not everyone imprisoned in the gulag system was a dissident .

  ok , i hope you are right . 
  i prefer these `` kids '' than the northern european xenophobes who most probably hate both the immigrants from magreb and the immigrants from the med countries . 
  as if the pegida folks absolutely love greeks , italians , etc. . 
  you accepted adams as a legitimate player when you signed the agreement in order to keep ni in the uk . 
  you ca n't have it both ways buddy . 
  the only reason labour 's pr seems worse than the tories ' is that every misstep by corbyn is taken out of context , twisted and amplified x100 by the media .

  they are people . 
  stop treating them like beasts who run on instinct gr8 b8 m8,

  antisemitism in europe is endemic . 
  it was n't brought by muslims , on the contrary , extreme islamists often use antisemitic tropes of european origin . 
  your point is shit . 
  especially given the fact that you do n't give a fuck about the homeless people and you just use them as a cheap argument . 
  wow , the cheapest argument ever made . 
  also , do n't you feel like a hypocrite still having this eu flair when you obviously do n't believe in any of the eu 's humanitarian values ? 
  this subreddit does n't have a problem with american articles as long as they reinforce their beliefs .

  you mean the fake rape accusation in cologne ?

  they really tried very hard for that , as opposed to these entitled immigrants .

  maybe if we did n't treat them as undesirables then fyrom would n't have grounds for such claims . 
  same story with the muslims in thrace : we 've been treating them as ` others ' and undesirables for decades , then complain when they turn to turkey for help . 
  what does it mean to be a slav ? 
  they speak a slavic language . 
  genetics are a completely different story . 
   the other 85 % would be paionian , since ancient macedonia did not include the vardar valley . 
  population genetics laugh at these miniscule distinctions . 
  slavic macedonians and greek macedonians are really close genetically . 
  you are correct . 
  linguistic differences exist but anyone who tries to use genetics as an argument is a fool . 
  i believe there are a lot of ( slavic ) macedonian people in canada , at least that 's what my dad has told me from his time living there . 
  a lot of them from the greek side of the border too . 
  is that accurate ? 
  stamkos the hockey player sounds like he is one of those . 
  rigas was ahead of his time . 
  you conveniently forget to mention the fact that a slavic macedonian minority actually exists in greece . 
  they are probably more macedonian than most of the greeks who live in greek macedonia currently and who mostly came from pontus and anatolia as refugees . 
  there * is * a slavic macedonian minority in greece and it has been treated terribly for the last 100 years . 
  arguing that this minority does n't exist is as laughable as claiming alexander was a slav . 
  member of the eu when it benefits us , `` sovereign '' when it doesnt .

  what is this , the third reich ... * the censorship of his comment seems scarier to me , more * third-reich-like * if you will , than the comment itself . 
  corruption ** could ** conceivably also be a matter of genetics ( like most things ) ... or not . 
  unless you hold that '' *** it is not !, 
  *** '' is an unquestionable a-priori , dogma . 
  look , some mental conditions are correlated with certain genetic markers , are they not ? 
  and these conditions are manifested by a patient 's tendencies and behaviours , are they not ? 
  so it 's ** not inconceivable ** that certain habitual behaviours might indeed be correlated with certain genetic markers . 
  in other words , what manifests itself as a sociopathic disregard for the welfare of the society in which one lives , with a subject functioning parasitically on that society ( positioning himself to divert societal efforts aimed at general benefits to ** only ** benefit oneself ) might be a symptom of some pathology ... one with a genetic aspect to it . 
  but this is a matter of research , of determination , of facts , of * truth/reality * not dogma . 
  and if there is , in * truth/reality * , a strong genetic correlation to such a pathology , then what ? 
  discussion of it must be what ... 
  cheers !,

  finally , '' * our kids have * *** immigrated *** '' means that they came from somewhere else to live in greece . 
  '' *** emigrate *** '' is what you do when you leave the country to move to another . 
  that 's it , carry on .

   '' * the church of hagia sophia ( literally `` holy wisdom '' ) in constantinople , now istanbul , was first dedicated in 360 by emperor constantius , son of the city 's founder , emperor constantine .

  originally called megale ekklesia ( great church ) , the name hagia sophia came into use around 430 . 
  the first church structure was destroyed during riots in 404 ; the second church , built and dedicated in 415 by emperor theodosius ii , burned down during the nika revolt of 532 , which caused vast destruction and death throughout the city .

  of course they can and do sometimes conflict . 
  what then ? 
  well , legal safeguards must be placed to protect individuals from mob-mentalities . 
   * all the talk about pinnacles of civilisation , past or modern , is necessarily romanticised . 
  while i love a lot of things sweden is doing now and i love a lot of things that were invented in ancient greece , would call neither `` a pinnacle of civilisation '' . 
  * that 's fine but whenever i search for societies that excel , as compared to others of their times ( the only meaningful comparison ) , ancient greece back then and sweden today seem to consistently pop-up . 
  so what else to do ? 
  if you can think of comparatively better societies than those two , that 'd be even better !, 
   * you question assumes that there 's a direct lineage between ancient greece and modern greece . 
  the area has been conquered and re-conquered , configured and re-configured a ton of times since then . 
  comparing the two is comparing apples to oranges . 
  it 's not so much decadence as just two different societies with only a few salient characteristics connecting them . 
  * undoubtedly !, 
  but the question is nonetheless still interesting , is n't it ? 
  cheers !, 
  do try to figure out whether something is ** accurate or not ** instead of trying to make it it fits some simple '' * racist/nationalist rhetoric * '' label . 
  i figure that maybe you 're faced with ideas outside your comfort zone and i may arguably write very badly , but do make an effort at least . 
  i 'll do my best to elucidate if you ask for clarification . 
  but so far you seem to deal with not understanding my comments by attempting to switch the subject matter to whether or not my comments fit your ready-made '' * inferior vs superior * '' prejudice . 
  this is so fucking idiotic !, 
  look , greeks are neither superior nor inferior and frankly , who gives a fuck ? 
  so , seriously , get off it !, 
  nonsense !, 
  i do n't think of '' * greeks as generally inferior * '' . 
  but i do n't think of greeks as * superior * either . 
  these terms are almost completely meaningless in this context . 
  however , i do find convincing the idea that ( as far a circumstances affect disposition ) , the sense of responsibility that characterises ethical thought requires one to be free . 
  slaves can seldom afford to be concerned about matters beyond their own selves , their assigned tasks and perhaps their family . 
  free self-determined men , on the other hand , do need to consider matters in terms of the welfare of their whole society . 
  because if they do n't worry about it themselves , nobody else will . 
  in any case , swedish behaviour reflects ethical responsibility , much more than greek behaviour does . 
  but that 's the thing : the hellenes basically invented ethical responsibility ( along with philosophy , politics and most sciences ) . 
  and northern tribes ( like the swedes ) used to be considered * completely barbaric . 
  today , sweden is a pinnacle of civilisation and greece like a hundred years behind them . 
  why ? 
  an intelligent , ethical and efficient society should normally produce no garbage whatsoever . 
  it 's not even that hard in theory . 
  in practise of course , that 's another matter . 
  no society that i know of , save perhaps some northern-european ones ( [ ** got ta love sweden !, 
  ** ] ( http://www.trueactivist.com/sweden-runs-out-of-garbage/ ) ) , have even come close to actualising this idea . 
  as for today 's greece , forget it . 
  concepts like * recycling * are beyond most greeks ' ability to even understand , let alone apply in practise . 
  oh they might talk about it , especially politicians , and pretend to understand why it 's important etc. 
  but they do n't actually '' * get it * '' , not really . 
  it 's like what a friend of mine ( who had been with msf in zimbabwe ) said about how it is to talk in cntral africa about why '' * democracy * '' is important . 
  '' * they know some basic platitudes to say to humour us , but they do n't actually seem to understand anything about it * '' she said . 
  well , it 's the same with greeks and recycling . 
  and because the whole thing flies over their head , they think that those who are in favour of it are being '' * naive * '' to use the more polite term . 
  there you have it . 
  but how could greeks have gotten so far back and so * low-minded * so to speak , especially after such a illustrious history ? 
  well , this has been the subject of many debates . 
  one theory is that like all peoples who have been slaves too long ( first of rome and then of the ottomans ) , greeks lost that sense of * responsibility * that characterises free men . 
  the mind of a slave only need think about how to survive , do as little as possible , to get/steal as much as possible and how to get away with stuff . 
  he feels no responsibility nor gives a fuck about the society around him . 
  after a enough generations of this , one only understand bribes and threats and becomes incapable of * ethical * thought . 
  * intellectually * , though the language is different , you 'll have better luck finding the descendants of the hellenes among people named something like '' * bengt samuelsson * '' than '' * evangelos venizelos * '' ( actual name '' * evangelos turkoglu * '' ) . 
  incidentally , had you , in ancient times , told a hellene ( or later a roman ) that northern ( swedish ) barbarians would one day represent the pinnacle of civilisation , they would have laughed . 
  cheers !,

  that would mean granting to greece the status of agriculturally exporting country , which would mean agricultural subsidies , which would mean competition for the other farming countries in europe ... 
  hah , in sofia you have 10 % better local purchasing power : http://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/compare_cities.jsp?country1=greece&amp;city1=athens&amp;country2=bulgaria&amp;city2=sofia, 
  not drachma ( there was at one point in time a 22 % inflation rate ) . 
  but ious denominated in euros . 
  it 's simple , really : `` do you want to get 70 % of the money back , or do you want to get 10-30 % of it back '' ? 
  afaik * very * few greeks want the country to leave the eu . 
  there are some that want to leave the euro but stay in the eu , but they are even fewer . 
  if tsipras announced that greece would leave the euro , i believe his government would fall within the day . 
  if he announced that greece would leave the eu , he would not survive the end of his speech . 
  i believe that tsipras would even sign the last offer by the troika if they just added a definitive clause for debt relief after 3 years , if the targets ( f.e. 
  surplus ) are met . 
  given the mass media 's behaviour the last week , he could say that the sky is blue and get misquoted ... 
  dude , us greeks have an opinion on everything , whether well-researched or not . 
  ... is that an appeal to authority i hear ? 
  sorry , i have to disagree here . 
  * democracy has been established because you can have a change of leadership without having heads roll . 
  the powers that be like this , as having democracy prevents losing a ) capital and/or property b ) their heads during the process of regime change . 
  * education : this was because the powers that be saw that with industrialization they needed more educated people to handle f.e. 
  accounting and paper pushing , these tasks needed knowledge of reading , writing and some math , and so far only the privileged had access to the latter . 
  free public education tracks nicely with industrialization . 
  * women 's equality with men was partially driven by the need to enlarge the working force ; allowing women to enter it in the 50s to 80s was synergistic with their empowernment . 
  * slavery : i ca n't find a reference now to it , so take this with as much salt as you can handle , but the adjusted per-capita cost of a slave was higher than the current cost of an unskilled employee ... 
  i think you may be a tad over the top ; i could equally argue that no means `` dudes , your numbers do n't add up '' and yes means `` let me bend over '' ... 
  up until now , the ecb has been extending ela under the premise that greece and banks were under a programme to manage , thus nominally liquid . 
  that ends on june 30th , and the ecb can no longer pretend that the banks are liquid , so no more ela ... 
  problem is that the `` pension cuts '' in all the recent proposals will affect to a disproportionate effect the low end of the total pension income ; you can cut 100 euros from a 1000 euro pension easier than from a 500 euro pension - the first is survivable , but the second will have people freezing to death in the winter ( and if you think that 500 euros should be enough to live on , it 's not uncommon for 100-200 euros of that to be used as support for their kids and grandkids ) . 
  oh , absolutely ( hell , just read the comments ) . 
  it 's still interesting , especially when the commentary is missing . 
  zerohedge has some very interesting commentary via the asia market opening . 
  greece has had universities as youth employment buffers - you ca n't be unemployed if you 're studying - for more than 20 years . 
  it 's not uncommon to have a phd in math be your waiter . 
  a lot of my friends have left the country to find employment elsewhere , but a lot of them are still there an unable to leave . 
  there will be no shortage of educated people ... 
   new democracy did do something along those lines with the dissolution of ert say what you want about them , but that was not one of the times . 
  you can buy a filter that can make mineral water out of tap water . 
  well , you will need to refill it from time to time , but it 's better than lugging alll that water around ... 
  [ never let a serious crisis go to waste ] ( http://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/quotes/r/rahmemanue409199.html ) . 
  this is exactly the point where you want to introduce this - do you think any government of an european country would give up sovereignity of taxation otherwise ? 
  oh no , the debt * in absolute terms * [ it is getting smaller now ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/greek_government-debt_crisis#/media/file:greek_debt_and_eu_average_since_1977.png ) , but due to the fact that the economy and gdp have crashed , debt to gdp is now much higher . 
  read my last parenthesis . 
  i think that trust has been eroded to the level that the troika believes its path should be followed to the letter , as the greek side will use any leeway to mess it up . 
  to the greeks on the other hand , the troika is looking more and more as if it 's intending to get paid as soon as possible , human cost be damned . 
  i did work at the largest university in greece . 
  it has over 73.000 registered students , and it 's budget ( excluding payroll ) for 2013 was 45 million . 
  of those , 17 million were for contracts on security and cleaning services . 
  we certainly did not have a battalion of cleaning ladies spit-shining everything . 
   just implement it then ? 
  varoufakis has repeatedly stated that any legislation with `` financial impact '' that was not approved by the troika would be seen as an unilateral departure from the existing agreement , and would cause the troika to break of negotiations . 
  he has also said that on the items the greek government agrees with the troika ( tax evasion , tax collection f.e. 
  ) , he has been blocked from implementing them by the troika themselves , as they want a single agreement to exist . 
  ( my reading : it 's just another way for the troika to pressure the greek government , along with a side benefit of painting them as dragging their feet on reforms ) . 
   second after having laid out the process the conclusion should be clear : if greece wants to propose anything , let their technical team do that in the respective meetings while i 'm not certain that i have this right , my impression is that it 's usually the other way around ; the high-level officials agree on policy , and then the technical team actually write the 100s of pages that are required for the implementation , considering laws , precedent , treaties , procedures etc. 
  sounds about right , and i think it 's par for the course when decision come from on high ... 
   cost of living in greece is only 9 % lower than in romania arghm that happens when i try to write on reddit from work - that is greece is 9 % higher than romania ( sorry , that was idiotic from me ) . 
  source : [ numbeo ] ( http://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/compare_cities.jsp?country1=romania&amp;city1=bucharest&amp;country2=greece&amp;city2=athens ), 
  interstingly , cost of living in greece is only 9 % lower than in romania , even though the average wage is 700 euros . 
  also , it 's not so much about absolute numbers , but the fact that the average wage in greece fell by 37 % . 
   the evil troika already accepted a much lower primary deficit target and even conceeded to all sort of exceptional financing schemes . 
  please , let 's be adults . 
  i did : `` right now '' . 
  the troika is not evil , cackling in the dark - it just has different priorities . 
  syriza also has put a lot of water in his wine . 
   right now the only thing that stops any deal from happening is syriza 's government actually committing to objectively quantifiable reforms that have a realistic chance of enabling syzira 's government to meet the current primary surplus target . 
  the `` current primary surplus target '' is at 1 % , which _ right now _ seems a hit and miss affair ( [ source ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/06/11/us-eurozone-greece-finance-minister-iduskbn0or10020150611 ) ) . 
   in short , the only thing that stands in a way of a deal is syriza 's government declaring something like `` we are committing to a a % primary surplus , and we will accomplish that by increasing b in revenue by doing so and so , and cutting b in spending by doing so and so . '', 
  afaik , and i could be wrong , the latest numbers are that we 're at 75 % payroll and pensions , 25 % everything else . 
  the second part has been cut to the bone , and serious malfunctions to the greek state will occur if it goes any lower . 
  on the other hand , any decrease to payroll & pensions will cause a gdp drop with a multiplier  1 ( ignoring the humanitarian side ) , thus it 's self-defeating because it 's only growing the debt/gdp datio . 
  the greek government has sent a [ proposal ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/06/03/us-eurozone-greece-proposal-iduskbn0oj1o720150603 ) ( sorry , ca n't find the exact text right now ) , and so far they are standing by it . 
  ( also , why has the troika prevented syriza from legislating the reforms both sides agree on for the last 4 months ? ), 
  syriza has its clowns too , both in and out of the government ( and do n't get me started on the `` odious debt '' morons ) , and they do not help to rebuild trust between the two parties ; that 's why varoufakis is proposing to create an independent institution to monitor the budget , because in the past 5 years a lot of promises have been broken w.r.t. 
  that . 
  because right now , both sides have painted themselves into a corner , politically . 
  syriza can not admit to giving in , and the troika can not admit to a course change . 
  to be honest , that did raise my eyebrows a bit , if for no other reason that it will cost them internally . 
  this might also imply that anyone that could claim an early pension has done so , and that the point is now moot . 
  dude , us movies are a major export industry ( for the us ) . 
  i just emigrated from greece to germany ; i love the summer here , where you wo n't get boiled alive if you 're out for 15 ' . 
  germany right now has sub-inflation interest rates , meaning that banks are in essence paying the german state to keep their money . 
  this is in part due to most other countries seen as too risky . 
  with the amount of stupidity concentrated on such a small volume , side-effects are bound to affect the participants . 
  can not confirm . 
  brawls in greek parliament would be won by golden dawn ... 
  only those that still held greek debt after the first 230 billion . 
  mostof the banks that held such debt at at that time were greek banks , which were originally forced to buy it at the legal equivalent of gunpoint . 
  guess who needed cach infusions after that ? 
  the same banks . 
  oh , and the pensions , who had their money in accounts at these banks ( also mandated by law ) . 
  i was under the impression that a successor to merkel is n't yet visible ... 
  i recently moved to berlin from greece . 
  rarely have i seen someone work as hard as the equivalent position in greece , and that goes from management , to retail , customer service and even the tax office . 
   greek habit of dragging their feet when it comes to painful reforms yep , that 's us , some of the time . 
  however , varoufakis has said to the troika at one point ( paraphrasing ) `` during the negotiations we do agree on a large part of reforms that need to be implemented , and disagree on a smaller percentage of reforms that we think will be ineffective . 
  : et us legislate the ones we agree on , in a way that does not cost anything extra '' . 
  the answer was more or less `` if you legislate them , negotiations are over '' . 
  follow the money ( and the missing money ) . 
   in germany , though , merchants have prooven repeatedly to be crooks . 
  no , that 's the default state for retail - it 's the human condition . 
  new word of the day : monkeysphere ( no , really , it 's non an insult ) . 
  look , if it was anyone else ( french , norwegian or dutch tax advisors ) , it * might * be borderline acceptable ; german tax inspectors would be seen extremely hostile , and any government that would invite them to greece would fall within the week , because populists will paint them as kneeling to economic invaders ( no matter how absurd that is ) .

  would you let those people live in your neighborhood ? 
  i assume they would be allowed to leave any time they want . 
  we do n't need to . 
  immigrants hate greece and most of them do also hate greeks ( keep in mind athens is the only european capital without a mosque ) . 
  every single immigrant comes to greece in order to get to germany or sweden . 
  if they know this is not the case , they wont even try and i am 99.9 % sure , most of the immigrants that are here will leave on their own . 
  this isnt about whether it is right to leave or to stay . 
  this is whether it is right to return and somehow be welcomed back with open arms . 
  i have to wonder , what about those who did n't leave because they felt the need to support their country ? 
  should n't they get something better in return ? 
  while i do believe that you are being a bit over-emotional i can see your point . 
  i do n't find it absurb that people do want a better future , but something bugs me with the idea that people leave their country in the blink of an eye not looking back twice . 
  would i call them traitors ? 
  would i accept them back ? 
  yes . 
  can anything be done to reward people like you ? 
  most likely not . 
  but i do agree with the notion that the most `` loyal '' citizens should somehow be rewarded . 
  many citizens have let the country to tear apart . 
  them going back to find it `` ready '' is somehow not right , it is unfair . 
  i think it depends . 
  someone who leaves their country while young will find it much harder to identify as his country of origin . 
  however , as time passes by you find yourself tied more and more to your homeland . 
  i do believe that ee has a very strong sense of patriotism and history , while there are countries in we where students do n't know their national anthem . 
  as a greek this makes me optimistic , but i also ca n't see any light at the end of the tunnel : / wish you guys the best !, 
  your vocabulary is advanced for a parrot, 
  it is not like banning burkinis is `` standing up for your values '' . 
  deporting illegals on the other hand ... 
  i saw a report where one complained that : `` this is not for a dog . 
  this is for a woman '', 
  [ here you go ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4xo3yw/how_is_greece_doing_economically_nowadays/?ref=search_posts ), 
  i 'm greek . 
  you remember the thread about greece . 
  `` hey ahmed , you can get out , we have a mr. smartass here . '', 
  did you hopefully forget the / s ? 
  true , but :  in the united kingdom several statutes criminalize hate speech against several categories of persons . 
  the statutes forbid communication which is hateful , threatening , abusive , or insulting and which targets a person on account of disability , ethnic or national origin , nationality ( including citizenship ) , race , religion , sexual orientation , or skin colour . 
  the penalties for hate speech include fines , imprisonment , or both, 
  also they are not `` setting them free '' , they will be under supervision, 
  i do n't say your statement is false , but out of curiosity what are some genocides not recognised by iags ? 
  seriously though , there are documents and photos of both of those events . 
  i just could n't believe that regular people write it off as `` plain ol' regular violence '' . 
  i thought it was used as an excuse from the goverment to evade reperations . 
  you always find some way to evade the real question . 
  shall we allow immigrants to get into here ? 
  the things you mentioned , are examples of how we treat tax-paying citizens . 
  of course we do n't abort disabled empryos , that does n't mean we will want more disabled people and to even imply that pension ( which legal citizens have earned with their own hard work ) is as harmful or unfair as putting illegals on welfare is ignorant at the very least . 
  honestly , i have donated to immigrants and i have interacted with many of them . 
  unfortunately i quickly realized that most of them are not the kind of person i would like to pay for . 
  you claim i do ignore biased sources while it is the only thing you do . 
  just to let things straight : i dont deny that terrible atrocities and war crimes did happen and greeks took part in it , many of which were taught or mentioned in our schools . 
  i have read and i do recognize that both sides did wrong , but to say that the ottomans did suffer more than anyone is the understatement of the century . 
  additionaly fighting for independence doesnt give you a free pass , but it is * slightly * better than genocide ( s ) . 
  i believe that it would be my right to dismiss it though . 
  do n't get me wrong , i do n't think that there ca n't be anyone who is of mena heritage and succesful . 
  my argument is that this minority does n't outweigh the disantvantage of allowing many illiterate people who do live off welfare . 
  illegal immigration does n't benefit society , because the plain truth is that most of the illegal ( or in some cases legal ) immigrants wo n't become productive citizens, 
  we also have to define what `` multicultural '' is . 
  i would argue that western europe countries have much more in common with each other or even with eastern europe than it does with the middle east . 
  in turn , it is easy to see which of the two would work better . 
   africans and arabs have brought a lot of benefits on an individual level i am still waiting for examples ... 
  i will give you a full reply tomorrow because it is late and i am on mobile , but this is again not even remotely close to a genocide . 
  it is also funny how turkey straight up ignores or downplays everything related to any genocide ( which in my oppinion were far more brutal ) . 
   genocide : the deliberate and systematic extermination of a national , racial , or cultural group everything you have sourced is directly linked to the war of independence . 
  i think you are well aware what is different with the greek genocide, 
  can you point to a single credible source that points to anything remotely similar to a `` genocide '' ? 
  slovakia is full of slovakians . 
  what are we gon na do ? '', 
  i do n't know . 
  i would happily trade one immigrant with two slovakians any day . 
  i would argue that free speech means that you should express yourself no matter your beliefs . 
  then i read that he commented about `` gassing the jews '' and i quickly changed my mind . 
  seriously , where is the line crossed ? 
  i am all up for hearing both far-left and far-right ideas , but how are we sure that ideas remain just that ? 
  on the other hand i am sure i have heard many times that we should `` burn the fascist pigs '' which is in theory equally hateful . 
  when is an idea truly dangerous ? 
  i am afraid this is the only one solution . 
  we have to act before it is too late . 
  torture ? 
  i dont think we would come across as what you might call `` humanitarian '' . 
  still , i would gladly have them deported . 
  shut up , you are racist ^ ^ / s, 
  oh i agree . 
  to me , it looks like someone started building something half-decent and then thought `` screw that '' and just started building homes left and right with no plan in mind . 
  the islands are nice though ... 
  the stock market relies on semi-accurate predictions . 
  you wo n't lose anything if you do n't participate in the anti-muslim circlejerk for a day . 
  listen , i do n't say there is no change , but how about waiting for more information before drawing conclusions ? 
  i could be a little biased , but i honestly think that thessaloniki is somewhat better than athens . 
  i would argue it is better than the alternative though ... 
  its nice in theory , until you realize they are thousands of europeans able * and * willing to work, 
  well , this is also a sad truth . 
  and dont even pretend they dont feel the same . 
  i believe that everyone wants to see their people and their culture prevail , no matter how selfish it sounds . 
  it is basic human nature . 
  of course that does n't mean we should n't help anyone in need . 
  i just dont think europe should help them * that way *, 
  he means that once they are on the island , what happens is basically up to them . 
  of course no one would want to torture anyone by all means , i wish we could accept the people that are truly looking for a better future , but when it comes to this subject , we tend to have an `` all or nothing '' mentality, 
  is n't there any age restrictions ?

  discrimination against some beliefs is perfectly okay . 
   `` discrimination : the unjust or prejudicial treatment of different categories of people , especially on the grounds of race , age , or sex . '', 
  if you * define * discrimination as something inherently something injust ( not the definition i would use ) then you 'd have to argue that something is injust before calling it discrimination -- but right now you 've been doing the opposite and treating something as unjust * because * you already consider it discrimination . 
   the same guy that tries to convince people that hating on islam is ok because they 're muslims no , i did n't say that 's the reason it 's ok to hate on islam . 
  if you want my own opinion , hating on islam is ok because islam is a false belief-system and a set of oppressive practices based on the supposed commands of a non-existent god . 
  hating on christianity , judaism , etc , is likewise okay for the same reasons . 
  only difference is that those religions have been already mostly defanged of political power , and islam has n't . 
   most muslims do n't . 
  which means that not all people you group under the label ` muslims ' have actually the same faith , the same religious beliefs , the same religion . 
  some ` muslims ' believe in a religion where it 's not okay to murder gays , and some ` muslims ' believe in a religion where it 's okay to murder gays . 
  are you saying that we should discriminate between those two religions , or that we should n't ? 
  careful here . 
  if we * should * discriminate between those religious beliefs , then you 're agreeing that some religious beliefs are better than others . 
  if we should n't discriminate between them , you just excused those people who treat all ` muslims ' the same . 
   yeah , odd how other imams or people like muhammad ali and malcom x did n't kill gays , huh ? 
  not only they did n't kill gays , they probably did n't think killing gays was okay either . 
  so you 're saying they did n't have the same religious beliefs as the people who say it 's okay to kill gays ? 
  i agree . 
  if you live in the us or western europe , the dominant religion of our society is egalitarianism , and ` discrimination ' is the primary sin . 
  you called a man ` discriminating ' and that was supposed to make us gasp in horror at his crime of ` discrimination ' ? 
  like calling someone ` heretic ' , or ` counterrevolutionary ' , some insults are only insults if other people already share your ideology . 
  egalitarianism is a much more benign religion that most others , but it has its own absurdities as i said . 
   it 's not ok to discriminate people for their religion if my religion said it was obligatory to murder people for being gay , and i actively followed the tenets of said religions , then you should definitely discriminate against me . 
   you assume that discriminating people for their culture and religion is ok . and you assume that it does n't . 
  but frankly that belief of yours is * shallow * , because you have the absurd privilege of living in a society where most religions have been defanged of power : when 's the last time that you saw aztecs make human sacrifice to their gods ? 
  when 's the last time you saw jewish people stone adulterers ? 
  when 's the last time you saw christians burn a heretic or hang a witch ? 
  and living in a society that in generations past * defeated * all those absurd practices of * religions * , you have the privilege of criticizing those who still attack the religions who * have n't * yet abolished all their own barbaric practices . 
  so are you , you are obviously discriminating against people who attack specific religions . 
   if you make a movie that 's actively attacking a specific religion , that 's discriminating on religion and that makes you a discriminating , hate-mongering prick it 's funny to see the level of self-contradictory insanity that your own religion has imbued you with . 
  some religions * are * explicitely systems of discrimination ( and some religions more so than others ) . 
  by your own argument if you attack systems of discrimination , that 's itself discrimating on discrimination , and that makes you attackers of discrimination `` discriminating , hate-mongering pricks '' . 
   kosovo is same as crimea except that there is us base instead of russian . 
  another major difference is that the serbs had already made themselves hated before the kosovo war , because of their own attempts to carve up bosnia & croatia . 
  so nobody gave a shit about serbia 's territorial integrity , because serbia had already failed to respect the territorial integrity of its neighbors . 
  ukraine has committed no such crime against any of its neighbors , no acts of aggression whatsoever -- so it gets sympathy from the rest of the world . 
  i doubt it 'll * manage * to destroy the eu , but greece will certainly give it its best try . 
  as i 've noted already a few times , and you 've been studiously ignoring , the publication of the european council on foreign relations on eu-russia relations ( http://www.ecfr.eu/publications/summary/a_power_audit_of_eu_russia_relations ) also calls greece a `` trojan horse of russia '' , so it 's not as if i 'm saying anything new . 
   if greece has been taken over by russophiles , then how come it 's been on the western side of geopolitics since 1821 ? 
  why are you going back two centuries , when my own argument has only been about events been happening in the last three decades or so ? 
  i 've never denied that greece had western-friendly governments ( both dictatorships and democratic ones ) in the further past . 
  as for ` western side of geopolitics ' , does your question translate to `` why are we still part of nato & the eu , if russophiles are ruling us ? '', 
  first of all , until tsipras , all the earlier russophile pms would n't have their parties ' agreement for an exit from eu or nato . 
  those parties were to a large extent composed by a mixture of western-friendly democrats and of chauvinists , not of russophiles . 
  as for why it remains in eu and nato still under tsipras , the phrase ` trojan horse of russia ' i think covers it . 
  in alexander dugin 's lecture in piraeus ( http://www.4pt.su/en/content/international-politics-and-eurasianist-vision ) `` professor dugin finally spoke on the role of greece in today 's europe claiming that it is much more important if greece contributes to the recreation of the architecture of europe by reinforcing the eastern european pole inside the eu than if greece joins the eurasian union . '', 
  so basically even the most prominent russian fascist ideologue around ( invited to do his lecture by the current greek fm kotzias ) effectively states out loud that greece is more useful to russia inside the european union , rather than joining the eurasian union instead . 
   even if the video is true , i do n't see how it proves anything about the `` evil russophiles taking over the government and only mitsotakis can stand up to them but unfortunately he was attacked by evil russophiles karamanlis and samaras '' first of all , i never said `` only mitsotakis can stand up to them '' . 
  in fact i did n't say that he stood up to them at all . 
  that he was not in their pocket does n't mean that he was bravely opposing them or anything like that . 
  as for whether it ` proves ' something about the russophiles , i never claimed that it ` proves ' anything by itself either . 
  no single fact ever proves anything by itself . 
  i expect you however to see as the * evidence * that it is , even if it 's not by itself conclusive . 
  if you keep your ears and eyes open instead of shutting them and loudly humming to yourself whenever someone mentions such evidence , eventually the evidence will indeed become overwhelming . 
  in the 1990s i was also highly sceptical of arguments about russophile infiltration in greece . 
  but eventually the evidence for such in greece became overwhelming and i could no longer deny them . 
  and as already mentioned , it 's not even as if it 's my conclusion alone : the `` power audit of eu-russia relations '' , a publication of the european council on foreign relations ( http://www.ecfr.eu/publications/summary/a_power_audit_of_eu_russia_relations ) also came to the conclusion since 2007 that greece acted like a trojan horse of russia inside the eu . 
   as for the video , i was unable to find anyone else reporting on it . 
   oh great , quoting far-right nutjob websites . 
  seriously ? 
  seriously ? 
  you called me ` completely crazy ' for stating true facts that i have now provided a video for ( and which you could have easily googled yourself ) , and now instead of apologizing for that insult , you now have the audacity of complaining about the political orientation of one of the links i found ? 
  is this what passes for integrity with you ? 
   it all makes sense now . 
  lol , did you just imply that i 'm far-right ? 
  i linked you to a page that openly loves russia , while i * despise * russia , and from that you got that i 'm supposedly far-right ? 
  fyi , i consider myself a progressive social democrat , that 's why i despise russia and support the eu , ( while both the far-right and the far-left adore russia and hate the eu ) . 
   are all leftists part of some sort of botnet that the hidden russophiles control ? 
  it was n't ` all leftists ' that participated in the task of disrupting parades . 
  why do n't you ask such a leftist protester why they did n't protest in alexandroupoli in that year , when they protested everywhere else ? 
  they 'll be more familiar with who gives them their marching orders . 
  but since you have n't yet even acknowledged that russians did in fact parade , something that i already provided a video for , facts available to us all , rather than this being a ` crazy ' claim of mine , i do n't think we 're ready to discuss the finer details of how the leftist squads are directed to their targets , which i do not know . 
   you are completely crazy . 
  russian troops do not participate in greek parades . 
  http://www.defencegreece.com/index.php/2011/10/russian-marines-parading-in-alexandroupolis-video/ `` just a few kilometers from the border the two largest orthodox armies , the greek and the russian , has just joined and marched for the first time together in the same parade , thrilling thousands of residents of the remote city of alexandroupolis '' it has video . 
  do please also note that this parade , was the * only * one that day that was n't disrupted by leftist protesters in the whole of greece . 
  here 's also one about russians parading in lemnos : http://www.defencenet.gr/defence/o/56966 they were also going to [ parade in salonica ] ( http://www.prisonplanet.gr/%cf%81%cf%89%cf%83%ce%b9%ce%b1-%ce%b7%cf%80%ce%b1/1185-%cf%84%ce%bf-%cf%81%cf%89%cf%83%ce%b9%ce%ba%cf%8c-%d0%bd%d0%be%d0%b2%d0%be%d1%87%d0%b5%d1%80%d0%ba%d0%b0%d1%81%d1%81%d0%ba-%cf%83%cf%84%ce%b7-%ce%b8%ce%b5%cf%83%cf%83%ce%b1%ce%bb%ce%bf%ce%bd%ce%af%ce%ba%ce%b7 ) but in regards to that one it seems at the end they were only allowed to parade separately , not join the official parade . 
   yes , as i said i completely agree with you that the rant above about the `` evil russophilles '' and the `` glorious mitsotakides '' is ridiculous . 
  yes , even when the government allows the russian army to march in national parades , some people are still determined to see no russophiles , hear no russophiles . 
  in greece it 's only politically acceptable ( even obligatory ) to bash people for being subservient to foreign interests only when those foreign interests are supposedly european , american , or israeli . 
  heavens forbid that someone speaks about * russian foreign interests * pulling the strings , then you 're just being ridiculous . 
  even though it 's not american , european or israeli armies that are allowed to participate in our parades , it 's only the russian ones . 
  i really wonder , if you do n't believe in the existence of russophilia ( or even russian-subservience ) in our former pms what do * you * guys believe is the connecting link between karamanlis and samaras ? 
  why did karamanlis bring samaras back to the party and support him against dora bakoyanni , if not for the fact that the both of them belonged to the russian geopolitical camp , and dora bakoyanni did n't ? 
  as for mitsotakis , the only thing i said in his favour was that his period of governance was `` one of the healthiest economically in modern greek history '' . 
  given how abysmal all the other periods of governance in modern greek history were , that 's hardly glorious praise . 
  if you disagree with that assessment of mine , please rank greek governments since the fall of junta according to their economic performance and tell me where the mitsotakis government ranks according to you . 
   you keep using the word `` russophile '' a lot . 
  no one in power in greece in the last 30 years was a `` russophile '' . 
  a power audit of eu relations ( 2007 ) : http://www.ecfr.eu/publications/summary/a_power_audit_of_eu_russia_relations '' ... the authors identify five distinct categories of countries . 
  greece and cyprus are referred to as ` trojan horses ' whose governments often defend positions close to russian interests , and who have been willing to veto common eu positions . '', 
  can you please explain to me this evaluation by this report , if there has n't been any russophile in position of power in greece ` in the last 30 years ' ? 
   samaras did nothing to apease the russians let 's ignore for the sec all the ways that he supported the investments of russians ( and chinese ) , and let 's see the acts of symbolism he has partaken in : he made his party a ` sister party ' to putin 's `` united russia '' . 
  he allowed the russian * army * to participate in the military parades for greek national holidays . 
  forgive me if i 'm forgetting something , but has any greek prime minister allowed americans , brits , or any of our other nato allies to participate in a national military parade ? 
  did n't samaras allow something to the russian army that none of our official nato allies would ever be allowed to do ? 
  on more practical matters , he allowed the ( fanatically russophile ) neonazi gang of golden dawn to grow into power . 
   karamanlis did almost nothing to apease the russians ( an oil pipe plan that came to naught ) one of his very first acts as leader of the party was to expel from it practically every western-friendly leading figure ( manos , souflias , kontogianopoulos ) , and he brought back samaras who was the chief supporter of the ` orthodox axis ' of greece-serbia-russia during the 1990s . 
  besides that , practically everything else he did as pm , from vetoing fyr macedonia 's membership in nato ( despite the earlier signed agreements between greece and fyr macedonia that prohibited such ) to cooperating with the communist party in mayoral elections , to military agreements with russia , to well , the bankruptcy of greece itself ... ... is there * anything * karamanlis did that can be said to have failed to support russian interests in one way or another ? 
   all our military equipment with the exception of a part of the air defence ( s-300 ) is either european or american .

  they are going to enact policies as if the majority of the country honestly supported them because they have every legal right ( and obligation ) to do so . 
  honestly this is n't so much politics as common sense . 
  voting is not a game . 
  what do you mean ? 
  he does n't praise hitler , therefore he ca n't be far right . 
  he is just another `` concerned citizen '' . 
  the meaning has not changed that much over the years , despite what the angry nationalist brigade wants to tell you . 
  [ refugee home are burned down ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/germany-222-refugee-homes-burned-or-attacked-arrests-a6763506.html ) and people [ cheer on ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/germany/12167405/anti-migrant-mob-in-germany-cheered-as-refugee-shelter-burned-down-in-front-of-them.html ) , especially in / r/europe where burning houses with refugee families in it is labelled `` concerned citizens being critical of immigration '' . 
   celebrated hitler 's birthday yeah there is no reason to worship a historical persona anymore . 
  this is another strawman . 
  far right = worshiping hitler . 
  nope . 
  you do n't have to celebrate his birthday to be right or far right . 
  but it is conveniently sold to us this way , like `` i do n't praise hitler , therefore i ca n't be a racist '' . 
  nobody gives a shit about hitler and the people who mention him like 99 % are angry nationalists trying to be sarcastic . 
  this is so true . 
  romanians and bulgarians were foaming at the mouth against the refugees when they were literally in the same wretched place 2 or 3 decades ago . 
  of course . 
  i mean , it was `` too much diversity '' that caused our financial collapse . 
  if he had less diversity , the 2008 crisis would never have affected us and the troika would never have imposed its will upon our proud motherland . 
  so it 's only natural for the wise and proud patriotic greek people to be against diversity . 
  edit : / s , if the sarcasm was not obvious enough, 
  what do the refugees have to do with diversity ? 
   if you need something , ask . 
  i got it all man !, 
  can i ask you to lie less ? 
   however , countries are bound to have both types of diversity . 
  we find that countries that are ethnically homogenous but ** diverse in values orientation ** are the ** best innovators ** . 
  pretty funny that you are downvoted for asking a question . 
  these are the same people who constantly complain that they are shut off a discussion by being unfairly labelled `` racists '' . 
  they love their closed-minded circlejerk . 
  just do n't dare to question the ridiculous reactionary narrative and you will be fine : * a dark conspiracy of globalist liberals are enforcing diversity upon the native proud patriotic population to break their indomitable patriotic spirit * . 
  who said it is a goal in itself ? 
  yeah no . 
  even if we had twice our numbers ( extreme unlikely to happen , but just saying ) we still could n't do shit about that what we need is a decent economy and better alliances ( eu ) to ensure territorial integrity, 
   he 's swedish - you can deduce this from the comment . 
  so actually i doubt it will backfire on him directly . 
  i know . 
  i usually search someone 's post history because more often than not , they are americans . 
  can you even imagine the trolling ? 
  there are a lot of people invested in this and all of them speak english . 
  when brexit starts , the flaming and trolling will reach unprecedented levels . 
  this place will be a warzone . 
  personally i 'm saving a lot of such messages . 
  i will send him a pm every day with all the shit he has wrote , just to remind him how wrong he was . 
   like how germany makes tens of billions off greece 's debt lol i never thought i 'd find a british tsipras supporter . 
  or are you just grasping at straws ? 
   the delusional leftist dream of a great big federation it 's like everything you disagree with is somehow `` leftist '' . 
  ridiculous  brexit was a fresh wind . 
  why do n't you wait until it actually happens ? 
  i am saving these comments . 
  you guys have talked so much shit , you do n't even realize how its going to backfire against you once shit hits the fan, 
  it 's funny that you guys keep saying that the eu will collapse `` soon '' but do n't even know when you will leave the eu . 
  do n't expect many people to trust you . 
  you tried to bring the eu down with your hissy fit and you failed . 
  all i can say to you now is ... good luck . 
  far left ? 
   the petty mentality a lot of pro-eu citizens have did you not understand me the first time ? 
  the `` petty mentality '' is a result of your utmost contempt for our institutions and our values . 
  i know there a lot of trumptards and far-right trolls that distort the discussion ( they are the loudest , after all ) but many europeans actually like the eu . 
  of course we criticize it a lot , but we generally like it . 
  it 's a good deal for many of us . 
  so tl/dr ; if you keep shitting on us , we 'll get mad . 
  you think we are petty against the uk , but in reality we are not nearly as insulting as you have been towards the eu . 
   why even bother criticising a country which is much more successful than yours because i can ? 
  it 's a discussion ? 
  i mean you are free to whine about the eu all you want nice to see how little you value free public discourse , though i did n't expect anything better from a brit, 
   yes because that 's how rational democracies work that is rich coming from a ` rational democracy ' who went on a hissy fit and left the eu due to some fake numbers printed on a bus . 
  if you are a ` rational democracy ' i 'd rather stick to tyranny , thank you very much . 
   seriously , fuck this sub . 
  i did n't even vote leave . 
  i swallowed all the bullshit about unity and solving problems . 
  empty words . 
  i like how literally no one of you voted leave . 
  it 's always the same : * i did n't vote leave , but ... * . 
  do you understand how transparent you are ? 
  you kept trash talking and insulting anyone and anything european , and now you have the nerve to get mad when people fire back ? 
  gtfo . 
  good riddance . 
  where is the far left ? 
  i am not the one bragging about my country 's soft power . 
  i know my country sucks balls . 
  i mean we tried to bully macedonia around and failed even at that . 
  you are the one that is bragging though , so i felt the need to bring you down to reality . 
  your diplomacy is , so far , embarrassing . 
  you shoulnd ' t even use the term `` soft power '' except if you are making jokes , like the country whose population went on a collective hissy fit because `` hurr durr too many foreigners '' and soured its reputation and relations with the most powerful trading bloc of the world . 
  i think you still live under the illusion of `` rule britannia ! '', 
  and it will take a couple of years ( and couple of bitchslaps ) to realize what you have done . 
  me , i already know my country sucks , i knew it way before the 2008 crisis . 
  it is time for you to learn the same lesson , 
   soft power is a beautiful thing . 
  you mean like pissing off the rest of the eu ? 
  is that using your power wisely ? 
  i have the feeling that when brits talk about `` soft power '' they basically mean `` become the lapdog of the usa ' . 
  tell that to our nationalists here . 
  the moment the population drops , they start raging against feminism and women who have become whores because they dare have a career and not breed all day . 
  you ca n't win when it comes to the population numbers . 
   sucks for you to tell them they were never really `` in '' . 
  sounds like you were n't paying attention to politics . 
  i ca n't blame you .

  that 's because the germanic tribes were the first people that the slavic tribes came in contact with and the slavs could n't understand shit the germanic people were saying . 
  you are the one who follows and trolls  i do not have to cite any shit just go and read the responses you got . 
  you do n't have to cite anything because i never said anything close to the things you claimed you dumbass . 
  and please , cite me the responses i got . 
   believing mainland greek superdupermasterrace i never said anything like that you clown . 
  i 'm from an island , not mainland btw  numerous times , he brought up that how anatolian greeks are inferior , etc. 
  are you retarded ? 
  seriously now , when did i say anything close to this ? 
  please source a comment of mine that i say this  i mean the guy claims greeks are more similar to portugese than balkans genetically speaking , greeks are closer to the rest of the southern europeans than to the balkans, 
   * not actual neighbours , spain has colonial cities in morocco , not an actual land border . 
  what a low effort argument . 
  anyway , spain is n't culturally similar to morocco . 
   * have n't shared the same empire since roman times . 
  in fact has never shared countries really . 
  you have no idea what you 're talking about . 
  what about the 7 centuries ( almost 8 ) of arabic rule of spain ? 
  you seem to have a poor grasp on history . 
   food , music , history , massive amounts of mexican-americans ? 
  food ? 
  germans love kebab , are they similar to turks ? 
  music ? 
  metal music is very popular in greece , does that make us culturally similar with the finns ? 
  and no , the us are not influenced by mexico in terms of music . 
  history ? 
  can you elaborate ? 
  mexican-americans ? 
  so , since there are millions of turks in germany , does that make germany and turkey culturally similar ? 
  no , it does n't . 
   sure , but if you actually look at our shared culture instead of hiding under your bed , you would notice that you 're very wrong . 
  that 's what you do n't want to understand . 
  there 's no shared culture . 
   most of them lived in anatolia ? 
  wrong , during the last centuries of the byzantine empire , most of them lived in constantinople and greece . 
  also , the byzantines were the ones who influenced anatolia . 
   25 years is enough during those times , slavic influence lasted much longer . 
  there 's no point in arguing with guys like you . 
  ** how the hell are 25 years enough ? 
  ** are you fucking serious ? 
  and no , there 's no slavic influence in greece , not in the language and not in the culture . 
   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/second_bulgarian_empire  pretty long did you even look at the map you sent me ? 
  it clearly says that parts of northern greece were captured and held by ivan asen ii from 1218 to 1241 . 
  ** that 's 23 years . 
  ** how is that even `` pretty long '' ? 
  also , the parts of central greece were ** vassal territories ** , they did n't control them . 
  even the map you sent me proves you wrong . 
   false , ideas were created in ancient greece ( very different from modern greece arguably ) so ? 
  italy is different from ancient rome as well . 
  my point is that the greeks helped establish what we refer today as the ` western civilization ' . 
   that led to western culture being born during the early modern era . 
  every single historian will say that the western civilization was born in the antiquity . 
  your claims are ridiculous . 
   you 're the one with the inferiority complex , you squeal like a pig when i mention how greece actually looks to everyone . 
  your arguments do n't make sense . 
  greece is not similar with any of her neighbors but you seem obsessed to say the opposite . 
   beside , this argument started when your complex forced you to jump in and screech that we are in fact more kurdish than balkan/caucasian , something you 've shut up about after i dropped proof to the countrary . 
  i never said that you have no influences from the balkans , i said the opposite , that you actually do , you have influences from the caucasus as well . 
  this argument started when you brought greece in the discussion . 
   your organisation , structure and efficiency matter i agree, 
  i agree , i also think that [ this ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-33479946 ) article that a greek user posted before is a good read about the situation in greece . 
  things are not that bad like some people make them seem to be . 
  but i agree with you though , i did n't say that we 're extremely efficient , and of course the goal should be to increase efficiency . 
  what does that have to do with the discussion we 're having ? 
  dude , stop trolling . 
  we call both of them ` gemista ' , this is the first time i hear about ` sarmades ' , did you pulled this claim out of your ass ? 
  i know , my point is that greeks were n't and are n't lazy . 
  this food was introduced in greece by anatolian refugees , i 'm not saying it 's greek , i 'm just saying we call it ` gemista ' which means stuffed, 
  i replied to you before but i deleted my comment since i could n't find a source of a poll i was talking about . 
  anyway , there are people who blame the eu and there are also people who believe it 's all our fault . 
  your generalizations are ridiculous , but i agree that the people who voted for politicians like those we had 30 years ago are responsible for bringing greece in this situation as well, 
   i think this is how they do it in greece too . 
  it 's called ` gemista ' in greece , not ` sarma ' or whatever . 
  and no , that 's not how gemista are cooked . 
  the worst part is that the `` lazy greeks/southerners '' thing was just bullshit . 
  afaik greeks work the most hours in the eu , along with spaniards i think . 
   slovenia is claiming it 's not balkans . 
  afaik slovenia and greece are rarely mentioned as part of the balkans . 
  slovenia is more like central european culturally ( ? ), 
  maybe , i do n't know , i could be wrong . 
  greece is culturally similar with southern italy rather than balkan countries . 
  true . 
  i did n't got it in the beginning :(, 
   bosniaks are just turkified serbs and croats that 's kinda wrong . 
  some are islamized croats and serbs , yes . 
  but there was bosnian identity even before their conversion to islam . 
  [ more on this article ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/bosniaks ), 
   nah lol how the fuck is that an argument ? 
  you sound like a 10 year old, 
   i see there is no point arguing here or you can simply say that you 've ran out of arguments . 
  i actually am a pao fan , you got this one right , but there 's no reason to be jealous of anyone , these two `` friendships '' are between hooligans . 
   because you think those wars were just `` wars that happened long ago '' you cant understand it . 
  what you do n't understand is that greece had countless military allies . 
  we do n't go around calling everyone a brother though . 
   when your country was in debt crisis the whole europe looked down on you as lazy and what not , but not here in serbia what a stupid comparison . 
  first of all , that `` lazy '' stereotype was proven wrong . 
  also , the `` whole europe '' has helped my country more than serbia has , so again , your comparison is pointless . 
  as if every single european criticizes the greeks and every serbian loves the greeks . 
   we remember '99 demonstrations against the bombings happened in all over europe , not just greece . 
  also , many planes who bombed serbia arrived from bases in greece , but that 's another story . 
   i met greek exchange student here , and we called each other `` brothers '' and neither of us are nationalists so what ? 
  please explain to me what does this add to the discussion .

  in an interview i saw , the tv reporter was interviewing the ex-pm of fyrom and the pm told the interview person that fyrom should accept its real history and let go of the macedonian fable . 
  the tv guy literally had a near melt-down , he got enraged but kept calm and told him that it they are true makedons !, 
  and to say otherwise is betrayal , etc . 
  he got really hurt from that statement and you could tell . 
  [ here is the interview ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvmr0cwskgi ) best part ex-pm of fyrom : ** in 1800 's you used to be killed if you said this country had anything to do with alexander , it used to be treason !, 
  now everything is backwards **, 
  do you have one for private ( house-hold ) debt ? 
  they are low-iq idiots who enjoy violence, 
  [ 6 % is lower than what they got in elections ? 
  ] ( http://greece.greekreporter.com/2014/09/21/opinion-polls-syriza-in-the-lead-over-new-democracy/ ), 
  [ from recent polling done last week ] ( http://greece.greekreporter.com/2014/09/21/opinion-polls-syriza-in-the-lead-over-new-democracy/ ) by two different polling groups , gd was sitting at 6 % for both which is lower support than in recent years . 
  gd is also basically tied with a growing pasok and new independent party . 
  the two main parties are each polling at around 20-23 % each, 
  greek islands , just pick anyone, 
  these idiots are polling at very low % compared to 2-3 years ago , looks like these idiotic stunts/leaked videos are making them look like fools , which they are . 
  even disregarding the naming issue which alone will prevent them from ever joining the eu/nato , lets see two other major issues . 
  economy - 4,000 $ gdp/capita which fyrom has is on par with the poorest in europe 2 . 
  major ethnic tensions , possible civil war within 10-20 years fyrom is 35-40 % islamic minority , mainly albanians . 
  who also just declared a new republic within fyrom this week . 
  there were ethnic riots in the last few months after a series of killings by albanians and tensions/hatred is rising between both groups . 
  even if they somehow solve these two major issues , which they will not . 
  then there is the greece issue , which is not a minor / `` petty '' issue like many people like to make it seem . 
  the greek region of makedon in northern greece has 3-4 million people and they feel like their culture/history is being stolen from them to appease a country and to be `` politically correct '' ( which is something greeks are n't ) you can see in just the recent ukraine-russia war happening that a 150 year old `` idea '' that putin brought called `` novarossiya '' which is the russian idea of controlling basically half of ukraine . 
  even hundreds of years later can come back to haunt a country . 
  after all the main reason fyrom even exists is because the soviets thought it would be a useful tool in going to war with greece and take over thessaloniki harbor and create a soviet naval base in the aegean . 
  in the far distant future , anything is possible so it is wise for any country to take the necessary steps to prevent a radical ideology like fyrom 's from becoming more powerful . 
  [ album of pics from archaeological site ] ( http://imgur.com/a/4rmfh#b7rpicp ) the tombs behind these statues which are guarding it are likely to be from alexander the great 's family or his top generals . 
  very small chance it is alexander the great himself whose last known burial site was in alexandria , egypt .

  think of gdp as the combined profits ( added value ) of a country ( company profits , salaries , pensions , investment proceeds , etc ) .

   if neither a tersorium nor water were available , the greeks and romans used \u03c0\u03b5\u03c3\u03c3\u03bf\u03b9 or pessoi , small stones .

  i am not sure anymore what you are trying to achieve . 
  i am not arguing with you , i was attempting to start a discussion . 
  look at some point i asked you about something and your reply was one-word while i am always trying to formulate an argument . 
  you said also you are in favor of democracy . 
  democracy has decided that this is not a good thing to happen . 
  i am just assuming that you are fine with the general mechanism , by your answers , but it just happened that this specific one was not in favor of your personal choices . 
  i did n't draw any far-fetched conclusion . 
  the state will impose fines as well , not only tax rates . 
  now , if you do n't want any anti-competition legislation it is your right , but the state has decided differently . 
  if the market was forcing a company that you liked out of business , i guess you would be unhappy but not protest against free-market for it . 
  the same mechanism from the opposite side , produced a regulation that you did not like . 
  the system as a whole however should have your full support , despite your personal choices getting disrespected from time to time . 
   they 're a business after all . 
  i suppose without google , no company can exist . 
  this is the reason that the eu has special rules for companies with dominant position such as google . 
  if google did not have this market share it would not be necessarily fined . 
  if your advertiser is your competitor as well , you are kind of screwed if he has a complete control of the market . 
  you have no where else to put your name . 
  simply , that i do n't see how our disagreement emerges , since this is a base case of where a free market gets regulated from a state to not allow unfair competition . 
  ok , so , what just happened ? 
  decided and imposed by whom ? 
  because google was manipulating its results for another market , nobody accused it for its capacity in its own market . 
  where did you learn about weather.com if the only search engine you are using is google , and google decides not to display it in the front page in order to erode its market share ? 
  what mechanism do you propose to make this re-allocation ? 
  given that the market has already made its verdict . 
  what you are describing is a general tendency and i see it as a macroscopic phenomenon . 
  on the microscopy of it and in the transitional effects that affect real people things are more messy . 
  people want to live and protect their livelihoods . 
  as a societal goal the general efficiency and productivity is secondary if it does not include them in the solution . 
  if the market forces have deemed them un-necessary . 
  democracy is a supervisory power that makes sure that many , or at least as many as possible , participate in this future at a sacrifice of a higher efficiency . 
  because the reason in this world is to live , and thus you create a society and an economy to achieve it , but not vice versa . 
  because google is the dominant player and there is a different set of rules for such players since their moves have detrimental effects on others . 
  the case is for google using its dominance in one market ( which nobody has accused it of achieving it ) to establish dominance in a second one . 
  it google was not the dominant player ( and we had 10-20 different search engines with a relatively homogeneous market share ) this would not have been illegal . 
  by the article that we are both reading , this assumption is quite obvious . 
  by combining our forces and electing representatives with a free , open and competitive process ( elections ) we are able to create a voice for our concerns which is what the eu commissioner for competition stands for . 
  i mean google is part of this effort to generate `` correct information '' and it was itself manipulating the results of its search engine . 
  a free market does not give to people what they want , it gives people with most market power what they want , by definition . 
  our society has higher order institutions , such as governments and elections , where the will of people with less market power are expressed and taken into account as well . 
  when you are dominating a market you have a different set of obligations . 
  you are not bound by the same rules as smaller players , ( e.g you should not try to stifle competition at its infancy - by preventing their entrance / you are still allowed to make an amazing product ) . 
  but this is an even stronger case where dominance in one market is being used to achieve dominance in a second one . 
  also not allowed . 
  you are overpricing them . 
  \u0399 do , but i also think that the powers that want it distorted might be paying better .

  would you change places with me since we both pay the same percentage ? 
  - i have n't been taught wrong . 
  it 's common knowledge that citizens pay taxes to receive public services of equally justifiable value . 
  maybe you have n't been taught this fundamental concept at all ? 
  - governments since the arrival of the troika are completely irrelevant . 
  they just do what they 're told and even that fails miserably . 
  - there are no islands with no vat in greece . 
  if the comparison bothers you so much , by all means ignore the uk column in that image . 
  do you still think that the 42 % of the earnings go to taxes is viable ? 
  slovenia and romania and other countries may or may not have the same percentage , that does n't mean it 's fair for anyone . 
  i have been taught that when one pays taxes expects to receive a somewhat equal value from them coming from the government and i can safely say that absolutely no person in greece can say that they are happy with the value they receive from what they 're paying .

  all of the migrants are clashing to shore in weak rafts either by themselves or with the aid of the turkish coast guard .

  they 're more like military games ; greek and turkish aircraft just chase each-other around and might even shit-talk on the radio .

  putin just released a pretty big statement over the matter .

  but all the other greeks listed turkey as their favorite neighbor ... 
  i 'm guessing op has a grandpa who filled him up with scary bedtime stories about all the `` evil ottomans ! '', 
  it would make for an amazing bf4 map . 
  how is he a fascist ? 
  thank you for your kind words . 
  :-) my favorite neighbor is turkey . 
  let 's see ... tsipras being a lame duck pm , economic growth fluctuating , and refugees ... tons and tons of refugees .

  the government in athens needs to start banning pets in more places . 
  if an area ca n't sustain pets then people should n't have them . 
  tons of apartments and other living areas in the us and europe ban pets for exactly these kinds of reasons . 
  laws exist for a reason , if you think people will naturally follow order then this is wrong . 
  are you fucking kidding me ? 
  there 's many grass areas and parks even .

  all the big shipping tycoons have their shipping companies and ships registered with other countries to avoid paying the `` socialistic '' greek government . 
  starbucks , apple , and mcdonald 's probably get their tax accountants from greece to be honest . 
  there 's tons of smokers in your country too ... 
  to be fair , judging by your comment history , you 're a pretty shit person as well . 
  welcome to the balkans :-d, 
  as a greek , i love smoking cigars and piped tobacco ( yes people look at me weird ) for the taste , especially while drinking .

  when taxation is n't enforced or the punishments are menial people do n't pay their taxes . 
  same reason why big corporations and the economic elite elsewhere dodge their taxes . 
  this concept also exists among greek nationalists and used to be a bigger thing .

  please expand on your opinion . 
  the turkish construction itself states that all citizens of turkey are by definition turks . 
  and since in turkey exist a lot of different ethnic groups and a lot of people with mixed ethnic ancestry , it is ludicrous to speak of the turkish nation as if it was a uniform turkish ethnicity . 
  what it is in fact is the continuation of the ottoman empire restricted in size .

    the `` article '' you linked gives no information about what has been happening during the last few weeks ,  as i said it gives a ** background ** into the politics , culture and history . 
  the op asked ** specifically ** about the ** current ** political problems . 
    the words albania or albanians appear a grand total of 4 times while greece or greeks appear 14 times and usually in a disparaging tone . 
   it 's the first of four other parts ... it 's long and in depth , you only read 1/4 of it i 'm thinking so why did you not link to the appropriate part ? 
  is there an appropriate part at all in that thing ( based on what the op asked ) ? 
    this looks like an attempt to shift the discussion from what the op wanted to know to something the government in skopje would prefer people discuss . 
   yea sure it 's all a big conspiracy with national us publications on board , skopje has no doubt bought out the us press / s what you are trying to do here is a failed attempt at [ reductio ad absurdum ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/reductio_ad_absurdum ) .

  please consider editing !, 
  well said . 
   finally , the children are taken because barnevernet thinks it is in their best interest not to become perfect little brown norwegians . 
  not to be assimilated . 
  the children are taken based on their situation not their `` whiteness . '', 
  racism can have many faces . 
  i most certainly would never say that norwegians discriminate based on skin color but this situation does seem to indicate that they do discriminate based on life choices . 
  please do not misunderstand , if the parents of all those children that got taken away were in fact abusing them then the authorities clearly did the right thing . 
  but it seems to me that the children were taken away from their parents because the authorities simply disapproved on the manner of the childrens ' upbringing . 
  which is discriminatory ( therefore in some interpretations racist ) and a slippery slope ... 
  the `` article '' you linked gives no information about what has been happening during the last few weeks , as the op requested . 
  the words albania or albanians appear a grand total of ** 4 ** times while greece or greeks appear ** 14 ** times and usually in a disparaging tone .

  i do not agree with people writting `` articles '' that represent their personal opinions as fact .

   * whats with the greek connection ? 
  from the `` article '' : `` the airport in macedonia is called `` alexander the great . '' ** that is a middle finger to the greeks ** . 
  they think that ** alex ** is theirs , period . 
  another middle finger exists in the center of skopje , the macedonian capital . 
  it is a giant statue of ** alex ** . 
  ** the government ** , a conservative government , ** has been making over skopje , on neo-classical lines . 
  there is the alexander statue . 
  there is the porta macedonia , a local arc de triomphe ( sic ) ** . 
  there are monuments to sundry independence figures . '', 
  stress in parts from me . 
   i do n't imagine many governments would like going to court with an 85 % chance of being told * they 're in the wrong * - that would crush their chances in the long run i think . 
  you are confusing justice with * perceived * legality . 
  the greek government simply concluded that there is no justice to be found in the courtroom and decided to not pursue the matter there .

  yup . 
  greece would have fallen a lot faster if jugoslavia had joined the axis instead of resisting . 
  in fact , the fortified greek positions across the border to bulgaria were never fully taken in battle but ordered to surrender after the germans invaded through present day fyrom ( indefensible position ) . 
  as to the futility or not of greek resistance , here 's what * hitler * had to say about it : [ for the sake of historical truth i must verify that only the greeks , of all the adversaries who confronted us , fought with bold courage and highest disregard of death .

  i do n't know , why we do n't ask kosovo ? 
  or crimea ? 
  or ossetia ? 
  why not both ? 
  the name is simply one part of the problem that is about * '' . . them trying to steal history , historical figures and lay claims on greek lands '' * . 
  people get all riled up because they think greece is opposed someone else using the word `` macedonia '' just cause . 
  its not . 
  its about building a fake nationalistic image , that then is used for claims about `` oppressed minorities '' '' [ unliberated macedonia ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9e/ethnicmacedonia.jpg ) '' etc in greece . 
  [ asylum productions ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_asylum ) on a country level . 
  greece consider the name and history appropiation part of irredentist claims . 
  so it will block the ascension since it will be seem as legimising those claims . 
  i will not bother to explain why this is the case , because it goes against the common narrative , it only leads to arguments whithout any point . 
  it is what it is . 
  well we blocked their nato membership , and still blocking after * 26 * years . 
  any politician that takes a step back will commit political suicide , and things have getting worse in that aspect , not better . 
  so you ignorance is telling again friend . 
  the constitution is about as vague ad it can get , and it definetely doesnt fix the name and history appropiation that probably are not done just for laughs . 
  at whitch point did i behaved in a ( apparent ) kind way while feeling superior ? 
  you asked a question , i gave you an answer , you didnt like , and you just dismissed any argument by making childish analogies , which kinda betrayed your ( somewhat understandable ) ignorance on the subject . 
  fyrom is not getting to eu with this name as long as greece has veto . 
  i am not going to educate you through reddit banter , and * maybe * you should not make opinions before studying it up a bit . 
  you mean a change in the constitution that can changed back or simply get sidesteped ? 
  words in a paper do n't matter much as long as actions do n't back them up . 
  that change happened to lower the heat after greece had applied a full on embargo to fyrom ... and then promptly forgotten when the embargo was lifted . 
   patronize 1 . treat with an apparent kindness which betrays a feeling of superiority . 
  i do n't think you know what patronizing means . 
  last time i checked , they are n't a member state . 
  nor anytime soon . 
  so we only start worry about nationalistic claims until they actually attack . 
  got it . 
   it has , yes , but why would anyone interfere in this ? 
  and if they did , who even support the macedonian claims ? 
  now maybe not , but these kidns fo things tend to stick around for a long long time . 
   aaand ? 
  the current liberal government of denmark promised a lot of things they did n't do . 
  that is just a part of politics . 
  the same did the social-democrats last time , and the liberals before the social-democrats , etc. 
  this is literally a non answer . 
  it doent matter if government do what they say , when people vote for it . 
  we just * hope * that all the governments that get elected are not going to act on their promises ? 
   oh come on . 
  there are statues of ancient greek and roman kings and emperors in denmark . 
  you are blowing it out of proportions . 
  it is just a name , is n't it ? 
  what makes the name special ? 
  does denmark claim that these statues where originally built by ancient danish that lived in athens , and that even now an oppressed majority of danish live in greece ? 
  because if they did , there would * also * be a problem . 
  in belgium , while n-va and vlaams belang are officially for full independence , there a lot of voices that support reunification of flanders with the netherlands . 
  preatty weak considering the present government , which has made numerous nationalistic and irredentist claims have risen to power since 1998 . 
   is macedonia in any way a danger to greece ? 
  so why does it matter ? 
  why do you assume this is the case ? 
  balkans have been notorious for greater powers interfering between two nations . 
   then it should be noted that it probably is n't what won them the election . 
   in regards to the macedonian government claiming greek land , then it should be noted that it probably is n't what won them the election . 
  but it was part of their ideology . 
  you cant ignore that . 
  and they wherent [ subtle ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/aug/14/alexander-great-macedonia-warrior-horse ) either . 
  did you miss the part where the current goverment supports this idea ? 
  sure , greece leaving the union . 
  it has not being a good choice for all parties considered . 
  ahh patronising other member states . 
  the true spirit of the union right there . 
  i think you should [ read ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_macedonia?wprov=sfla1 ) a bit more before forming an opinion . 
  [ united macedonia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_macedonia?wprov=sfla1 ), 
  afaik , the present day * goverment * of greece doesnt claim in any place in turkish , albanian or bulgarian soil . 
  while fyroms does . 
  as matter of fact i do know a lot of dutch and flemish that are still pissed about 1831 . 
   i just read that ancient ( city state ) greeks thought macedonians were backward half-idiots who were nomads , spoke in a laughable and unintelligible dialect , and were uncultured barbarians . 
  huh if the dutch wiki is using language like that , maybe you should try another version then . 
  and you assume i can read dutch because ? 
  are all those people making claims to other peoples lands ? 
  also the geographical region called macedonia is like , 10 % of the state . 
  and you * just * read that where ? 
  did you skipped the part where greece was independent kingdoms and cities and hated each others guts ? 
  does luxemburg a wants to claim luxemburg b ? 
  sooo having another sovereign state appropiate your history and throught that lay claim to half your country is `` nationalism '' . 
  what * you * think is irrelevant . 
  they are not getting in as long as greece is a member . 
  yup . 
  nope . 
  and they are not getting in either . 
  fyrom is not becoming a member anytime soon unless they fix that name . 
  greece will veto 100 % . 
  modern nationalism is a bit of a modern concept . 
  but if you think people didnt self identify themselves via mutual culture , language and history and warred of this since forever you are dumb . 
  the `` melting pot '' usually takes generations and its inevitable since cultures change and evolve anyways . 
  last king was constantine , and his interference with the democratic processes led to a coup d'etat by military hardliners and 7 years of dictatorship . 
  except some very old monarchists he is seen as a massive failure . 
  doesnt help that monarchy was imposed in greece by the great powers after indepedence ( first king was bavarian ) . 
  \u03a0\u03b1\u03c4\u03c1\u03b9\u03b4\u03b1 / patritha ( th as is `` that '' ) .

  but it is a feminine word .

  \u03a4he mayor kaminis had started a campain to clean the grafiti of the center of athens , take off the posters from buildings and repair and paint many neoclasical buildings ... guess what happened?some bastards ( i suspect anarchists because they have done things like that before ) repainted grafiti over the painted buildings with provocative messages against the mayor and his effort.i do not know if his effort continued ... one of the main problem of athens other than the dirt , is that it has so many ugly blocks of flats ... and of course you have the dirt to top it that make things so much worse ...

  my sincere condolences to the dutch people ... it is trully a tragedy :(, 
   sorry for not giving two shits when `` macedonians '' are doing the same thing to greece , claiming they are descendants of a 2,400 year old greek king who created the hellenistic period  basically albania is pulling the same thing on them , claiming skopje as their `` historic lands '' . 
  that entire place is like the fucking twilight zone . 
  yeah it is difficult to feel sorry for them when they appropriate our culture and our history and they make teritorial demands to us . 
  allright , thank you for the information.so i guess i have to double the kudos to the croatian goverment . 
  i guess you are right , being an ex communist take doesn\u0384t always mean you are not heavily influenced by the church . 
   i thought the catholic church was quite powerful in croatia , too . 
  or has that declined ? 
  croatia was an ex communist state so i believe ( and i may be in the wrong ) that croatian church does not have the huge influence that italian and greek catholic and orthodox churches have . 
  and greece ... but in those countries the church ( catholic and greek christian orthodox respectively ) still hold great power ... 
  congratulations croatia !, 
   at least in the case of france they have been french citizens . 
  so its probably difficult to prevent them coming back if they are citizens . 
  i think the war itself may prevent them from coming back , if you know what i mean ... 
   because de-radicalize them yeah good luck with the de-radicalization thing ... 
   f u ignore that veluhiotis was working against the gcp intrests during the occupations in seting up that ? democratic network ? 
  ( i rly dont know what to call the selfgov network ) he was setting bybassing any idea of central command then yes they only started hating him after the war . 
  they wherent commies dude they just didnt want a british king . 
  gcp ofc claims that they where but them not caring about its orders says all there needs to be said about that . 
  who was n't s a communist?velouhiotis?he was a communist through and through.he commited suicide when the communist party kicked him out for gods sake!what democratic network?what kind of democracy exterminates someone who voices a different opinion?elas established a reighn of terror in the rural areas exterminating anyone who refused to join its ranks and swear loyalty to the greek communist party . 
  tell me something i do not know . 
   so you do have right wing blinders on . . you understand that they hated him cause he wasnt obeying them and still think he was their obedient gofer that would deliver greece to stalin !?!, 
  its amazing the conflicting things ppl with right/left wing blinders can hold in their heads . 
  there is no confict at all . 
  aris veluhiotis became a black sheep when he refused to obey the gcp orders to lay down his arms . 
  ( when the gcp agreed to temporary stop the rebelion in varkiza treaty ) . simple as that.aris velouhiotis simple refused to stop fighthing and the gcp exterminated him moraly forcing him to commit suicide as there was nothing to live for . 
  what lies?gcp declared publicly at least twice , twice , once before ww2 ( 1924 read http://realkke.wordpress.com/2007/10/23/zito-i-aneksartiti-makedonia/ ) and once during the greek civil war of 1945-1949 its decision to practically give greek macedonia to slavs . 
  ( a united and independened macedonia and thrace gcp declared ) . earth and water it was offering in order to gain their support and take over greece with their help . 
  why stop the flow of fighers to syria?i presume they are fanatic muslims who lived in denmark and want to abandon denmark to go fight in their jihad.let them go and good ridance . 
   elas wasnt doing that it was creating an independed cooperative government among the ppl in rural and mounten areas the gcp hated velouhioti as much as the right you seem intrested , dig more you 'll figure it out . 
  lol.elas was the tool of the gcp and the greek communist party had one goal in mind : to take over and rule greece and in order to do that not only they rose in rebelion whilst they where offered the chance to participate in democratic elections but also offered greek macedonia to the slavs.twice . 
  as for aris velouhiotis he was only hated when he dissobeyed orders and refused to be an obedient sheep to the communist party leadership.that is the fate of everyone that displeased the greek communist party then.first the moral extermination ( slandering the victim as traitor , spy , capitalist agent etc ) and then the physical extermination often by torture.today they follow the same attitude without the torture and murder , the latter because they were defeated and not allowed to rule.i dread to think what would have happened if they won the war.goodbye greek macedonia for starters , then a reighn of terror and slaughter . 
   err ... thats is near the end of the war ... about 2 years to late to be the start of zervas 's anti elas campain . 
  also am not sure how much i can trust that site . 
  not saying its rightwing bs but am not sure it isnt have to check out the site some more . 
  would you like a source from a pro communist blog that admits the fact ( that psaros was murdered ) although it tries to attribute the killing to the action of a single hot headed elas guy?it also states that they hunted psaros because psaros forces attacked elas forces.the fact is that psaros and many more of his fighters were murdered by elas.and my main point is that elas was trying to take over greece even during the occupation and found resistance in their plans by other greeks that did not want to see greece turn into a communist state . 
   u need to realise that i know quite a bit about that war for one i know that the communist party of greece had 0 control over elas , the gcp wanted a `` proletariat revolution '' elas was setting up a . . dont know what to call it a sort of trading network between villages and towns that didnt need the communist party to lead it and was thus unwanted ( democracy is scary to those that want power ) . 
  as for elas starting the `` civil war '' ... rly ? 
  zervas spend most of the war fighting elas instead of germans but elas striking back is to blame ? 
  how can you not know this ? 
  you have to be kidding me.elas was in direct control of the greek communist party.zervas had to fight against elas because elas forces kept attacking his.remember psaros and his resistance group that was murdered by elas when they surrended to them?that was the fate that zervas was trying to avoid . 
  \u039core on psaros http://www.istorikathemata.com/2011/01/542.html ( in greek ) . 
   u srsly dont know that pireaus was bombed to shit by the allies to force us to accept the king ? 
   britan helped the british king of greece subdue the upprising of greeks against him calling them communists helped sell it and apperently still works . 
  the then king of greece was not british.he was of danish origin.other than that please point me to a source that verifies that the british bombarded pireus in 1945 in order to force the greeks to accept the king back . 
  you have to realise you have a lot to learn about the greek civil war of 1945-1949 . it was a war that actually started way before the liberation of greece because elas controlled by the greek communist party attacked ( remember psaros and his resistance group that were slaughtered by the elas forces for refusing to be under communist controll ? ), 
  every other greek resistance group in greece ( like zerva 's group in ipirus and like psaro 's group that got anihilated ) trying to force them under communist control , while greece was still under axis occupation.the communists were of course trying to prepare the ground in order to take greece under communist control after the liberation and transform it into a communist state.they failed to take under consideration that a lot of other greeks did not want greece to become a communist state ( every other party in greece opposed the communist rebellion of 1945-1949 ) . you seem to be unaware that not every greek then was in the same mind as the greek communists.in fact most of them were against the greek communist party 's ideas and goals and it showed when the traitors of the greek communist party tried to take the power by force , refusing to participate in democratic elections ( they new they did not have the majority ) and offering earth and water to the slavs ( the greek macedonia teritory , an act that disgusted a lot of greek communists that left the party ) in order to gain their support.in the end the democratic army ( ha ha ha ) that is the greek communist forces were slavic in composition by almost a half . 
   am refering to the bombing by the allies in '45 because we didnt want the return of a brit king of greece but wanted an election . 
   edit : seen as you appear to be greek you might wana ask your grandparents who was commading ( and financing ) the `` loyalist '' forces during the so called greek civil war . 
  again what bombing do you reffer to?the only bombing that took place was against the communist parties forces that rebelled even though they did have positions in the goverment ( they chose to resigh ) and refused to participate in democratic elections.so even though they had the opportunity to get elected into power they chose the undemocratic way of rebelling . 
  britain first and then usa helped the goverment forces fight the armed communist rebellion.the communists were backed by albania , yugoslavia and bulgaria that offered munition , weaponry , food , clothing , training and shelter to the traitors of the greek communist party ( i call them traitors not only because they tried to take the power by force but because they got to the point to offer greek macedonia-not fyrom to the slavs in order to get their support ) . 
   are you a joke persona ? 
  or is it your job to keep copy/pasting pro-government lines ? 
  am i a joke persona too?we have ears and a working brain.tsipras and syriza sound like a bad copy of a.papandrew.i am old enough to remember what a.papandrew said . 
   syriza is for those who think that the gravy train will come back , that `` ye good olde times '' with absurd and rampant waste , graft and corruption will come back , that everyone will get their government jobs back . 
  they should stop beliving in these delusions . 
  true.but i predict fast backpetaling by tsipras and the rest of the gang in case they win the elections.unlike a.papandrew they no longer can borrow money without a care in the world and spend it with abandon . 
   i agree , tsipras is for the complete idiots who voted for pasok in the 80 's / 90 's . 
  that is totally correct.his party grew thanks mainly to ex pasok members that abandoned pasok ( when after the shit hit the fan , tried to change it 's politics and lost the vast majority of it 's supporters ) and flocked to syriza that kept supporting the same politics as old pasok . 
   the real victims are the european taxpayers that are paying higher taxes now to pay for the greek bailout . 
  greeks at least got to enjoy the overspending for a while in the form of lower taxes , higher public sector benefits , better services , etc. 
  i did n't get to vote in the greek elections , the greeks did , they 're not victims when they have a democracy and get to choose their leaders that made these decisions . 
  i am a greek voter that always wanted to vote for the right people.the problem is they were ( and still are not ) no `` right '' candidates to vote for . 
   of course not . 
  but in a democracy , it is the people 's job to oversee their politicians and kick those out that are corrupt . 
   in greece , unfortunately that has not happened for decades . 
   not only that . 
  many normal people participated . 
  receiving illegitimately money from the government .

  also keep telling us about the `` slippery slope '' of europe , despite nothing slipping anywhere for decades . 
  this is the first time i 've heard of kfc hellas . 
  i bet its mostly people in athens who eat that shit . 
  it 's the same thing ? 
  one is a insane ideology , the other one is ... people . 
  actual , real , living people . 
  i think it dangerous to conflate the two . 
   the `` ultra right wing '' i 'm talking about ... that is not the ultra right wing , but i guess you are being sarcastic . 
  i was referring to the real ultra right wing . 
   it 's amazing how absolutely villified europe 's less-than-left kind-sorta-right wing parties have become . 
  and this villification breeds resentment , which then leads them to move further to the right . 
  i get this feeling too . 
  its basically the new postmodern ( millennial ? ), 
  culture of self-entitlement and instant-gratification . 
  if we do n't respect or even listen to their moronic opinions , they whine and get even angrier . 
  that seems like a bad idea . 
  if rights are given by `` god '' , people who do n't believe in god ( or believe in a different god ) will never respect them . 
  to be fair , being an atheist offended religious people for centuries and was illegal and/or lethal to be an atheist . 
  its funny now that the tables have turned , to see religious people get so upset ? 
  or at least ironic . 
  only if they are muslim . 
  as long as you are not a communist or propagating communist ideas . 
  or anything sexual ( like a boob accidentally showing on national tv ) or simply anything `` indecent '' or `` sexually promiscuous '' . 
  heck , or anything that can be considered terrorism . 
  you have the largest prison population in the world , largest ( by far ) incarceration rate in the developed world , but you have the `` freedom of speech '' to say how awesome america is !, 
  well that 's great . 
  oh right , the `` ultra right wing '' are a bunch of `` wimps '' who merely stab , murder and attack people . 
  while the tyrannical oppressive left ... bothers people online . 
  clearly the left is so much worse !, 
  if you think its muslim/refugees , you are in for a surprise . 
  you ca n't do that . 
  too many christians who feel entitled to their religious superiority . 
  that is why they viciously blame the muslims , so as their own backwardness will not show . 
  funny how angry people get at the muslim invaders yet the natives also think religion should be off-limits . 
   no , gun policy is security issue in which member states have free reign , and in which they can make decisions only unanimously . 
  or so it should be . 
  not if you have freedom of movement across eu countries . 
  then it obviously does n't make sense . 
  its common sense that you have to give something when entering a confederation of sovereign states . 
  clearly you have to make some compromises , because if nobody made any , no union could ever possibly exist . 
  it would more be like canadians claiming to be the only americans , because they are part of the general region . 
  greece has a good argument here . 
  even though i sometimes think its a waste of diplomatic capital , this whole dispute i mean , its still evident that the so-called `` macedonian '' side is retarded . 
  you ca n't please everyone . 
  also you ca n't expect politicians wo n't cater to your desires 100 % of the time . 
  some times you will be disappointed because your views are rejected and that is perfectly democratic . 
  its not that i do n't empathize with people feeling `` left out '' its just that there is n't any perfect political system . 
  i do n't understand why you need to be 100 % confident ( or 100 % right , as other posters said ) in order to disagree with a position . 
  personally i am never 100 % confident because of the underlying complexity of politics . 
  but i still disagree with whatever the afd stands for . 
  for example in greek politics i am not 100 % confident in tsipras ( far from it ) but i still reserve my right to strongly oppose the golden dawn . 
  just because you disagree with her policy does not mean she is undemocratic . 
  she was elected thrice , had very high approval ratings and still enjoys the approval of approx . 
  half the population - despite her blunders . 
  disagree all you wish but there is nothing undemocratic going on here . 
  i love that i can freely move and work within the eu . 
  already living and working in germany for years . 
  a motivated person can have access to opportunities that were denied to him/her in his/her country of origin . 
  to be fair , that has n't ever worked out . 
  better grumpy flatmate than murderously hostile neighbor . 
  since people can freely move and live within the eu , it makes sense to regulate their access to lethal firearms . 
  the terrorist attacks in france only hastened this directive . 
  i think this is to be expected . 
  the eu is n't the usa , people generally do n't feel entitled to owning guns . 
  i do n't understand that logic . 
  yeah i am not 100 % right , but neither are you . 
  nobody is . 
  we just make the best decisions we can . 
  the fact that you are not 100 % right at anything does not mean you should welcome your opponents winning . 
  you are allowed to disagree with someone . 
  in fact , you can disagree with someone and still respect them . 
  for example i am strongly pro-choice but people should have the right to vote against it . 
  i do n't get it , i 'd never ever want it implemented , i think its bad for women 's rights . 
  but if someone wants to vote a far-right party that outlaws abortion that is how democracy works . 
  i 'd rather take that risk rather than ban opposing views . 
  all of this is common sense to educated people ( not dissing you nor implying you are uneducated , just saying ) so i do n't feel like discussing this or my personal honesty which you seem intent on attacking . 
  so take it easy and have a nice day friend . 
  good point , but if every party is the same then does n't that mean that people ( generally speaking , as a trend ) want similar things ? 
  if people do n't all want similar things , then parties like afd get elected . 
  its natural and as i said , i get it . 
  the question is why is this a good thing for people that disagree with them ? 
  disagreeing with someone literally means that you find their ideas wrong and thus harmful ( i guess ? ), 
  so you do n't want society to implement them . 
  does n't mean you hate them or want them dead or exiled . 
  its called disagreement and its ok . 
  take a chill pill and carefully read what i wrote :  of course its the people 's right to vote for them , of course its good for their own voters if they are elected . 
  no disagreement there . 
   just let me repeat that i respect people 's free choice to vote for the afd and get them elected . 
  i am not arguing against that . 
  can you please explain how its a good thing having ** people you fundamentally disagree with ** passing laws ? 
  totally honest question btw . 
  of course its the people 's right to vote for them , of course its good for their own voters if they are elected . 
  no disagreement there . 
  but how can one tell people who are opposed to this far-right ideology that ... this is a good thing ? 
  we are forced to accept opinions that we strongly disagree with ? 
  i am sorry and i do n't mean to insult but this sounds `` orwellian '' to me , like a black = white or good = bad thing . 
  know what i mean ? 
  just let me repeat that i respect people 's free choice to vote for the afd and get them elected . 
  i am not arguing against that . 
  i see what you are saying but is the afd program really going to be blocked by the constitutional court ?

  why not during the last 5 months ? 
  why not just today ? 
  i can choose time that suits my point of view as well you know . 
   just checked and afghanistan under the taliban and zimwabwe are examples of defaulted countries ** true . 
  they are examples of defaulted countries .

  yeah those damn greeks . 
  if only ** every single proposal ** made by both greece and the creditors included amendments to restrict early retirement ... ... oh wait, 
   a lot of things that have been put in writing in 2012 and are the basis of the current `` bailout '' have not been implemented . 
  feel free to prove me wrong , but the only thing to my knowledge that greece failed to meet , were the projections . 
  all the second bailout terms concerning cuts etc were applied . 
  that 's why there 's this disbelief in the troika 's program . 
  plus you can look around , greece had the best reform rating among all nations in the eu the past 5 years . 
   debt restructuring would be part of the next round of talks . 
  you need to understand that debt restructuring and whatever reforms/measures are needed in order for greece to get back on track are inter-dependent on each other . 
  if the measures accepted today are inadequate without some form of debt restructuring , what 's the point of applying them ? 
  the proposed measures should take into account the changes in the debt structure . 
  in other words debt restructuring is not an incentive . 
  but part of the changes needed . 
  just so that people do n't get confused like i did . 
  $ 8.50 is the hourly wage . 
  not daily . 
  it is the same published on sunday by the eu executives . 
  it 's not new - though for obvious reasons it 's branded as such . 
   under juncker 's offer , tsipras would have to send a written acceptance by tuesday of the terms published by the eu executive on sunday and agree to campaign in favour of the bailout in the planned july 5 referendum . ', 
  the * possibility * of debt relief is not the same as a * guarantee * of a debt relief . 
  that 's double speak for `` we shall see '' . 
  it 's also double standards . 
  why do they expect the greek govt to put everything in writing ( remember the start of the negotiations ? ), 
  but on their end a promise for consideration of debt relief - not even a guarantee - from a serial liar should be enough ? 
  there 's - probably - nothing to it . 
  ca n't be 100 % sure of course , but the `` sources '' are the big greek media . 
  the govt has stated the rejection of junckers latest proposal and have issued a non-paper for the clear response of the greek government . 
  ft reached out to an `` unnamed '' government official who stated u-turns are not under consideration . 
  as it stands , it looks like those reports come from the `` big media '' in greece . 
  you know the same media that tried to incite further bank-runs with the report that atm withdrawals will be limited to $ 20 . 
  another newspaper claimed that there were no $ 20 bills in the atms but following the next day atms would dispense only $ 20 bills ( 0 sense ) . 
  anyway , the govt has stated the rejection of junckers latest proposal and have issued a non-paper for the clear response of the greek government . 
  ** tsipras to back down and accept juncker proposal . 
  ** the pm and government are considering backing out from the `` no '' in yesterday evening 's juncker proposal . 
  the pressure that has been accumulating and the conditions of asphyxiation in the market from closing the banks , in conjunction with the repercussions of the greek program expiration at midnight , but also the pressures from government and party officials that internally for the time being are keeping their distances in regards to the referendum , are leading to a change of position . 
  according to information , the government has already send word to brussels that they are doing a fresh re-evaluation of the commission 's president 's final proposal that includes - among others - debt adjustment in octomber and changes in the ekas . 
  -- though the machine translation did n't do a half - bad job but anyway . 
  do you prefer `` chairman of the council of economic advisers '' and `` senior economic policy adviser during the 2008 obama presidential campaign '' previous to that ? 
  how about professor at the university of chicago 's booth school of business ? 
  one would think that those references ought to be enough to not be a `` self-proclaimed '' expert . 
  but i guess having a single lawyer degree makes you viable to be [ head of the negotiations ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jean-claude_juncker ) but a b.a. 
  in economics from yale university and a ph.d. in economics from mit is not enough for a phone interview with the washington post about the matter . 
  yeah . 
  bad varoufakis . 
  you dare have * fun * ? 
  are you smiling ? 
  do n't you feel for your people ? 
  if you want to say something bad about v-man , you should say that the dude claimed 1h before the capital controls were enacted that no capital controls would be enacted . 
  but a picture of him greeting a colleague in a heartfelt way is not demeaning in the least . 
   deeply recommend you never open this subject with an older romanian . 
  ever . 
  an older romanian would never equate the situation in greece with communism . 
  that 's exactly what * you * did . 
  i do not agree with a referendum at this point . 
  however : 1 . 
  it 's ** not ** the dictionary definition of loaded question . 
  a loaded question contains an unjustified or controversial assumption that the recipient is forced to accept . 
  have you stopped taking drugs ? 
  the loaded question here is that you assume the question recipient has taken drugs in the past and any reply in the yes/no form means the recipient accepting that assumption . 
  that did n't stop them a couple years back from signing the documents though . 
  remember the `` we signed a document that no-one read '' ? 
  the premise of the referendum is this : accept hard measures and do n't risk anything or go for broke ? 
  that 's what the referendum is . 
  i wo n't argue about that . 
  though for obvious reasons time is a commodity we ca n't afford . 
  there will be no court action . 
  it 's just a `` legal '' retort to those claiming that the ez members can kick out greece if a no is voted at the referendum . 
  it 's psychobabble or legalbabble or whatever you want to call it . 
   your questions are ridiculous because whatever greece does next affects me directly in quite a major way do you get a say-so in the german elections ? 
  do n't they affect the euro in quite a major way ? 
  do you get a say-so in the us elections ? 
  do n't they affect the euro in quite a major way ? 
  just because you 've invested in greek banks does not mean you have a right to have a say-so in what happens here . 
  if that were the case then we might as well put up a german and french flag on the acropolis since we owe them around $ 150b . 
  if you were 35 + y old you would probably know what a communist regime looks like . 
  you would n't be spewing nonsense like '' western europe does n't know how communists work . '', 
  because obviously , you do n't . 
  having a leftist government does not a communist government make . 
  go ask your grandparents about communism , read ( or come and visit ) greece * then * tell me if * anything * is remotely similar to your stalinist romania of the 50 's or even ceausescu 's regime in the 70 's . 
  as for the `` war '' , the proposition is ridiculous at best . 
  what , do you expect that a reasonable reaction towards an `` irrational government '' would be to send tanks ? 
  really ? 
  why the fuck do you care if we organize a referendum or not ? 
  why the fuck do you care if that referendum is rational or not ? 
  this is getting fucking ridiculous , yeah we owe people a shit ton of money i get it , but that does n't give you the fucking right to object on what * should * be a democratic procedure of a sovereign nation . 
  what , are you a fucking lawyer now , expert in international affairs ? 
  if they ( we ) think we have legal grounds , let them ( us ) have our day in court . 
  what the fuck are you afraid of ? 
  if it 's hallucinatory or has absolutely no relation with reality it will be thrown off the court . 
  if not , then hurrah for us . 
  as for the rest of your bullshit post , yeah we 're communists pro russian country ready to start wwiii and overprint euros to pay our loans . 
  i like how in the same article the rumor is denied by the ministry of finance . 
  `` the ministry of finance denies information that came to light that the limit of daily transactions from atms will be reduced from 60 to 20 euros . '', 
  yet they still post it .

  one more time ? 
  the difference is ( at least , one of ** many ** differences ) is that mlk argued that african americans should have equal rights . 
  he never tried to dictate how whites should live or what their culture should be like . 
  what you are doing is trying to make everyone share your own conservative lifestyle . 
  you are expressing opinions about how other people should live , and then you go and vote for populist far right wingers to bring your ideas into law . 
  huge difference . 
  and yeah sorry but you are not entitled to that . 
  the world does n't owe you anything . 
  you can only dictate what you do on your own property . 
   it was in the article posted here yesterday . 
  i do n't think so . 
  i searched for your quoted text and it does not appear anywhere . 
  i mean i could be wrong , but i would expect it to be visible . 
   if you 're in a society where it 's not the norm to wear a headscarf at work and your employer asks you to remove it , just take it off ; you need to make an effort to integrate into local culture . 
  nope , employers are not arbiters of culture . 
  luckily the law bans visible crosses as much as burqas so its ok . 
   how can you be tired of hearing so many people talk of an idea because it 's a group of mostly non-germans that are ideologically committed to bringing back a conservative way of life and shoving it down our throats . 
  this groups resides on the internet and is particularly angry , using trollish tactics . 
  that is why they are visible . 
  in real life , they are not so visible . 
  especially not in germany . 
  believe me you 'd find very few people arguing for `` identity by blood '' in germany . 
  that comes from what i assume to be a genuine concern for human life . 
  on the other hand , your patronizing comments arise from the frustration of not seeing the world functioning as you think it should i.e. 
  a neatly arranged series of imposed conservative monocultures . 
  i am sorry man but you are just not entitled to have a world exactly as you 'd want it . 
  people are different . 
   people are upset because the proposed categories include things like `` negative comments against immigration '' - which is absurd . 
  i 'm sorry i did n't find this in the article nor in the [ press release ] ( http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_ip-16-1937_en.htm ) . 
  you put quotes around it so i guess you are quoting someone ? 
   if you think you need to cover up the women in your life because otherwise they 're just asking to get raped , then yeah , you 're an uncivilized barbarian . 
  that 's great , but lets not move the goalposts . 
  what if you wear your headscarf to work ? 
  how much of an anti-european terrorist does that make you , like on a scale from 1 to 10 ? 
  he has a point though . 
  all you guys keep repeating is how dumb the germans are for abandoning their blood and not worshiping their conservative culture that they themselves put to rest . 
  it 's their right to do so . 
  how can you judge others like this ? 
  just because someone has a boner for conservative monocultures does not mean all people should be forced to live that way . 
   the notion of identity by blood died long ago yes it has . 
  please let it rest . 
  it 's not coming back . 
  it 's already over and you are bemoaning its loss as if it happened yesterday . 
  it 's a done deal . 
  your mistake lies in thinking this is caused by a global leftist conspiracy , and not the people themselves . 
   the notion of identity by blood died long ago germans know this . 
  they chose it . 
  it was n't forced upon them . 
  i understand that you are opposed to any society that does not have a conservative monoculture imposed upon its members and in all aspects of their lives ... but please realise that some people do n't want to live that way . 
  and that is ok . 
  again you are talking about `` cause '' . 
  nobody talked about that . 
  we are talking about incitement , for which libel is a good example , it 's perfectly understood and accepted by everyone and there are already laws against it . 
  we are not arguing semantics , you just started talking about `` cause '' and `` personal responsibility '' which is anyone 's guess . 
  i generally avoid vague , subjective concepts . 
  you may want to google `` libel '' . 
  words can have an objectively negative impact on your life . 
  i am surprised you do n't know this , because everybody else does . 
   and that punishing incitement as a cause for actions is foolish . 
  i do n't know what that means . 
  as a cause ? 
  nobody argued that . 
  the law says : incitement . 
  also words are `` just words '' but sometimes verbal harassment is literally worse than violence . 
  i think any adult understands this . 
  it 's ok to doubt it , since you are agnostic  but it 's still true . 
  i do n't share your understanding of european history nor current european values ( which are very different than those of the barbaric christian middle ages ) . 
  and that 's ok . point is , we have the same rights even if we disagree . 
  you do n't have a special status because you identify with christianity . 
  so no , you do n't get to wear whatever you want , like for example your cross :  to ban `` any visible signs of their political , philosophical or religious beliefs '' . 
  keep that stuff out of sight please . 
  sadly not because / u/jackalripper argued against incitement . 
  look at [ how this started ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4m64t6/arstechnica_google_twitter_facebook_hate_speech/d3svr22 ) . 
  you , on the other hand , accept that incitement is a real thing . 
  it can happen . 
  so you disagree . 
  it 's over . 
  no one mentioned the responsibility of the perpetrator himself , which is pretty much given . 
  you will be held responsible even if others `` convinced '' you to do stuff . 
  and as i said nobody mentioned that , or even argued against it . 
  this is just a false dichotomy you guys set up . 
  i think i was pretty clear ? 
  being european is not limited to being christian . 
  so you should n't get any special privileges . 
  so / u/jackalripper was wrong ? 
  he clearly mentioned incitement to violence . 
  to incite :  encourage or stir up ( violent or unlawful behaviour ) i also like how he one-upped despite you arguing the exact opposite . 
  says the bulgarian who a mere 5 years ago was considered a gypsy thief invader . 
  ask any nationalist what they said about you . 
  also no , this is not your continent . 
  you do n't own it . 
  i am an atheist and i do n't adhere to any of these alleged christian `` values '' and `` traditions '' and this continent is my own just as much as it is yours whether you like it or not ( you do n't , which means you 'll just have to deal with it ) . 
   responsibility is still his/her for these actions i do n't see what this has to do with anything . 
  if you murder someone you are always held responsible , no matter who `` convinced '' you to do it . 
  you may find this surprising but people are influenced by other people . 
  not arguing for or against this law , just saying , words tend to affect others . 
  how can it possibly be otherwise ? 
  do you think humans exist in an isolated solipsistic state ? 
   the date is just coincidence . 
  you forgot an ** / s **,

  using captain euro as an example of eu inefficiency . 
  i mean is it really down to that ? 
  lol, 
  poland ? 
   if the entire world became part of the soviet union one day in the 1980s then war would cease to exist instantly . 
  but how happy would the peoples be with this arrangement ? 
  i do n't know ... if their elected representatives made their countries join , along with referendums etc. 
  i do n't see why people would be unhappy . 
  but of course it would n't happen that way , with the ussr there would be an actual military invasion . 
   i also find it absurd that you consider the eu as the sole factor for peace in western europe , you should look up ww2 and its effects you should look up ww1 and its effects , if you think its so absurd . 
  the collective damage to the european psyche was umaginable by our modern standards . 
  just raw horror on a scale that was never seen before . 
  but in some years , when the new batch of conscripts rose to age , the same thing happened again . 
  now i do n't think the eu is the sole factor , but its definitely a huge one . 
  nato itself ca n't guarantee peace forever , because its a military alliance and not a political one . 
  wars very often the results of politics , so in that sense the eu must have helped . 
  and of course you can disregard or disagree with all that , but you are still left with nationalism . 
  i assume that nationalism would run rampant if the eu collapsed , because they would have had a hand in it , therefore the chance of conflicts would be even higher . 
  this needs to be like in a faq or stickied in the main page, 
  read my posts again to see if i ignore nato or not . 
  and the phrase is a catchphrase , having been used by all kinds of weirdos to conveniently ignore correlations that do n't fit the narrative . 
  correlations are usually important . 
  also i do n't have to know your views since i did n't reference them . 
  you seem to be too willing to take offence , so enjoy . 
  they did it once for greece . 
  they should have left the country to crash and burn , but they tried to save it in the name of political stability . 
  let 's not repeat the same mistake twice . 
  uk voters need to face the full consequences of their actions , both good and bad . 
   i do n't understand how the british media allowed the brexit camp ( especially bojo and his ilk ) to blatantly lie they way they did . 
  why not ? 
  nationalism and right wing reactionary ideas are very easy to sell . 
  too easy , i 'd say . 
  yeah i 've heard that catchphrase but generally speaking , correlations might be important and should be examined . 
  ignoring a correlation ( major world political events ) because it does not suite one 's political views is a big mistake . 
  you should not be using that quote to support it . 
  sure . 
  so europe being peaceful caused the eu to form . 
  i can buy that if you explain what caused this abnormal lull in human warfare that we are currently experiencing . 
   so what did orban recently do that upset the right people ? 
  got ta love the echo chamber of the ring wing any criticism is used as proof that they are doing the correct thing , since ( allegedly ) the right people are pissed . 
  so the more they criticize and condemn you , the more justified you feel you are . 
  it 's almost orwellian in its brilliance !, 
  it 's like an intersection of teenagers trolling and politics . 
  sadly though these are adults who vote, 
  the thing is , there is this massive new wave of right wing trolls , most of them being american-based , huge supporters of donald trump , ideologically committed to stamping out sjws with a religious fervour . 
  you can see them on most topics , and they troll with comments like the one / u/czettnersandor wrote . 
  fox news , along with other american media like breitbart , are spearheading this right-wing propaganda by telling everyone how europe is currently operating under sharia law when at the same time lgbts are extremely privileged and receive social welfare for being gay , all while political correctness is the # 1 threat to modern civilization and can probably end human life as we know it . 
  so anyway it 's not anti-american hatred , it 's mostly frustration with the current brand of idiocy that emanates from america and chose to target europe . 
  i do n't think it represents the us as a whole but you have to see that it 's aggravating . 
  that would be a good point . 
  of course there was cyprus , two nato countries practically engaging in warfare between one another ( greece and turkey ) , but besides that obviously nato contributed to peace . 
  do you also think that our peace is a coincidence ? 
  well if it does n't matter that is a very poor case of power creep, 
   common foreign policy i do n't think so, 
  dude you ca n't gun down women and children at the border , even if a [ hip right wing ] ( http://www.dw.com/en/german-right-leaning-afd-leader-calls-for-police-right-to-shoot-at-refugees/a-19013137 ) party supports it . 
  it 's illegal and immoral . 
  not to mention , most of them come through greece , which has sea borders . 
  i hope you realize that you ca n't build a wall on sea . 
  til angela merkel is a leftist . 
   the thing is , you push your view as the only rational view . 
  you mean like / u/anteral labeling everyone who does n't have right-wing views as `` full retard '' ? 
  or is it ok when people who agree with you do it ? 
  you are allowed to call lefties full retard . 
  on the other hand , if you critisize the right wingers omg literally hitler political correctness is being shoved down my throat stop this tyranny, 
   this is because moving from india to sweden is banned . 
  one of the most inane comments ever . 
  maybe the indian driver likes his town/city/village / community ? 
  not all people move around the globe chasing money 24/7 , even when they have the opportunity . 
  why ca n't some people accept my unfounded premise if i shout loud enough ? 
  they do care , because its the right-wingers that are aligned with them . 
  they share the same worldview and , to some extent , future goals . 
  and while it 's not unheard of , its difficult to get the same level of support with left-wingers . 
  yeah i just wrote a whole comment regarding how you are not `` being made to vote until the eu gets the answer it wants '' and you just repeated the same premise . 
   welcome to a secular society it 's funny because if you sent the same piece of paper to a conservative we would get upset and reply with `` but but but europe is a christian continent !, 
  i agree that other solutions would be better , like foreign aid or just helping the people there . 
  but they work only in theory , not in reality . 
  no one can go into syria , no one wants to get involved in the country ( except russia ofc ) so the option of any direct intervention does not exist . 
  the dominant rhetoric is that there are many solutions readily available , yet the treacherous politicians refuse to implement any since they prefer to just accept refugees in their own countries . 
  that makes them traitors who are serving some nefarious politically correct leftist progressive international conspiracy , of which angela merkel is an important pawn . 
  but again , in reality , there are n't many options . 
  you ca n't get too much involved in syria due to assad and russia . 
  the world , especially eu , does not have any desire to `` spread democracy '' anywhere . 
   yes , people very much have inherent ambitions and motivations such as ? 
  i guess its just a coincidence that we have stopped killing one another the moment these international agreements were put in place ? 
  if you look at history , europeans have been murdering other europeans literally forever . 
  you could not live a life and raise your family without going through one or two major conflicts . 
  it was just a part of life . 
  now you are so spoiled to not only live in peace but you have even forgotten what war is like . 
  and you act ungratefully , as if this peace came about by its own accord , like by magic or something . 
   like ireland had a choice , but made the wrong one so was given the opportunity to make the right one . 
  at least lets get the facts straight . 
  after the first referendum , [ guarantees were given ] ( http://www.thejournal.ie/meps-approve-irelands-lisbon-treaty-add-ons-390399-mar2012/ ) to assuage the fears that were raised by the `` no '' side :  the constitutional affairs committee of the european parliament approved the decision reached by eu leaders in june 2009 to offer full assurances to ireland that the lisbon treaty would not affect ireland ' z corporate tax rate , military neutrality or abortion laws . 
  once that rhetoric was denied to the `` no '' folks , they did n't have much of a leg to stand on . 
  [ same with denmark ] ( http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/europpblog/2015/10/19/asking-the-public-twice-why-do-voters-change-their-minds-in-second-referendums-on-eu-treaties/ ) , the eu listened and gave specific guarantees so that people would not vote based on intimidation , panic and uncertainty :  with the edinburgh agreement , denmark would have four opt-outs in the fields of european citizenship , economic and monetary union , defence policy , and justice and home affairs . 
  ireland , on the other hand , gained guarantees concerning its military neutrality with the seville declaration after the nice referendum , and on the irish commissioner , competency over tax rates , abortion , neutrality , and workers ' rights after the lisbon referendum . 
  as i understand it , your argument is that irish are so dumb that if you ask them the same question twice , you are in fact manipulating their brain to give the exact opposite answer . 
  me , i just do n't think that irish people are that retarded . 
   they are net producers . 
  speaking as another `` net producer '' , we are as good as the infrastructure allows us to be . 
  i imagine if these people just appeared in poland the next day , they would be next to useless .

  he 'd love to see our relations with the rest of the west to deteriorate as much as possible . 
  no one believes that though . 
  we are not that stupid . 
  time to reset the counter then ? 
  that 's an overly simplistic view . 
  if you think reality is such then you are very wrong . 
  as you say `` signs '' . 
  those signs might be enough to justify an intervention of 5 % ( irish case ) but they are not in our case . 
  we already had 30 % fall and with the new proposals another 12 % is certain . 
  so comparisons are not helpful . 
  not really . 
  people are not angry , they just do n't believe anyone and anything now . 
  true !, 
  but unfortunately the thing is that the troika proposals lead that way too . 
  they are not complete and they are not leading to a solution . 
  they too are not viable . 
  this is paramount for how people feel atm . 
  btw i am voting for yes not because that the troika proposals are viable . 
  i will vote yes on the hope that something might come to give that viability . 
  au contraire !, 
  putin very much wants greece to leave . 
  greece will be much more useful to him then . 
   we are making fun of the atm people . 
  then you are an idiot . 
  you have no idea what urgent need these people might have . 
  no it is not . 
  in fact i do n't know anyone that believes that . 
  running joke ? 
  glad you had a laugh then . 
  church 's wealth is not money sitting in some bank account . 
  church 's weatlh is mostly land . 
  with the money they have they do the best they can . 
  they are not only providing free meals , they are supporting the poor in many ways . 
  as you can see , perfectly organized queues and if you are lucky ... http://www.iefimerida.gr/sites/default/files/oures-atm-3.jpg :d hint : go to an atm that 's near beauty shops !, 
   do your really think greece would have to rely on it 's own military ? 
  emphatically yes !, 
   alright , here 's the plan . 
  we 'll buy out the greeks but in return , ** they must be a us territory for 5 years ** , agree to hosts bases , use the usd , and direct a greek mythology epic adventure , hollywood style . 
  then they can declare independence , rejoin eu , and repeat the process . 
  make it 500 years and we have a deal !, 
  the army has no saying in all this . 
  absolutely nothing from there . 
  it is really funny to even mention about the army cause even if the politicians asked them to do something they 'd reply to them with a big feck off . 
  the church also didnt do any `` political '' comments . 
  they do organize free meals etc for people in need though . 
  hahahhahha more like for the next decade !, 
  absolutely safe . 
  there are parts of athens that you should avoid walking during the night but that has nothing to do with all this . 
  the way these news are presented by the media , people would think that it 's a warlike situation here . 
  in fact the only difference there is than from normality are the queues infront of the atms . 
  queues perfectly organized and where people waiting and bitter joking about the situation . 
  nothing more . 
  so dont you worry , you 'll have a good time . 
  they are going to work from tuesday on . 
  it is in greek : says `` without atms on monday '' http://news247.gr/eidiseis/oikonomia/capital-controls-kleistes-trapezes-kai-xrhmatisthrio-th-deytera.3551945.html, 
  you think wrong !, 
  very wrong . 
  you 'll be absolutely fine . 
  you 'll have a great time . 
  with all this talk it 's natural you worry but you should n't . 
  you 'll have a great time there !, 
  and tomorrow the atms will be closed . 
  you are wrong . 
  no most of them do not leave towards italy . 
  that 's simply a lie . 
  one has only to see what the situation is on the 2 ports ( patras & igoumenitsa ) that have ferries to italy to see that the situation is similar to calais . 
  many stuck there and ca n't get out . 
  so pure bollocks . 
  also , greeks right to immigrate to other eu countries have nothing to do with schengen . 
  bollocks again . 
  so check your facts please . 
  you 've got it very wrong . 
  immigrants want to travel through but they are stuck in greece because of the dublin accord . 
  by far the largest percentage of them are stuck here and only a small fraction managed to leave the borders . 
  hence the need and proposal for quotas . 
  if everything goes wrong ( both with economy and a new pan european immigration policy ) then what i see is greece letting them go the same as italy . 
  many greeks are already in many eu countries that 's nothing new . 
  many eu nationals are also in greece . 
  to even compare this with the illegal immigration is nothing less than disgusting . 
  shame on you !, 
  what immigration has anything to do about it ? 
  elaborate please . 
  yes they do . 
  some have 600 euros/day others 1200 euros/day, 
  it 's after the referendum . 
  but yes very long . 
  according to news sites in greece the banks will stay closed until july 6th . 
  atms will operate . 
  limit is not announced yet . 
  the latest joke on the greek internet : `` i bend to tie my shoes and someone puts a credit card to my arse '' `` cool down brothers '' :d edit : corrected june into july !, 
  thank you for pointing it !, 
  exactly this !, 
  me too . 
  thank you for your wishes . 
  no mate , it 's a complete luck of interest to point what should 've been obvious ( cause all the info is easily obtained ) it is n't . 
  so be it . 
  do n't get stuck in the argument itself mate . 
  see the whole picture . 
  it is easy to find it . 
  it will be for your own benefit .

  yeah but stil ottoman empire was n't accepting gays . 
  saying that only high class can love openly whoever they want is not progressive at all . 
  okay the rest of the world was n't that accepting but really what 's the difference ? 
  hell there is no emperor that could n't have whatever he wanted in bed , there 's no difference whether it is legal for high class or not . 
  and something that is n't criminalized doesn ' mean it is accepted or even legalized . 
  countries were beeing gay is n't a crime yet if they marry their marriege is n't recognized . 
  islam is not gay friendly . 
  the quran clearly denies homosexuality do n't claim that islam can be gay friendly . 
  edit : okay you downvoters better visit saudi arabia , iran , egypt or indonesia let 's see how progressive islam is !, 
  turkey beeing the most free country and stil u ca n't live a normal life while beeing gay ... even the muslims in the uk and the other countries they migrate to ( new generation too ) do not support gay rights . 
  [ an article of muslims in the uk and homosexuality ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/apr/11/british-muslims-strong-sense-of-belonging-poll-homosexuality-sharia-law ) ~ ~ i 'm waiting for this guy now that is muslim and accepts gay people . 
  congrats you have basic human consciousness but most muslims are not gay friendly ~ ~, 
  okay it was more progressive then but we live in 2017 and this fun fact could n't be more uselles.islam is not gay friendly . 
  if someone who is `` muslim '' is gay friendly he is not a muslim.that simple . 
  the religion denies homosexuals and that 's it . 
  the quran denies the gays and it degrades the women . 
  people who try to change it are delusional . 
  i am frustated that this thing is happening . 
  young girls and boys are oppresed every day and here we have some people supporting this trend . 
  that is sex not gender . 
  the first is biological and the second is social contruct . 
  i think it does though ; / ?

  this is n't a trait of muslims alone . 
  you 'd be pleased to know there 's an oktoberfest soon , for the eighth time so far , held in the west bank , in a lovely palestinian brewery . 
  the islamic attitude to alcohol is a very relaxed one nowadays - i for one have never encountered a muslim neighbour who has shunned alcohol in general , even though some did ( or do ) so during the ramadan . 
   said that oktoberfest is offensive and intolerant towards muslims if you summed it up in less than half a sentence , that 's probably not what they said . 
   i said that if they did n't like our culture they could fuck off and i did n't want them here . 
  one of them became even angrier and punched me in the face . 
  you acted like a dick , and the other guy acted like a dick , and you got treated like a dick .

  funniest comment today , 10/10 . 
  germany is doing fine , really . 
  despite pushing their various agendas - which is what any nation does - they are doing much better than the ever-threatened uk or the lets-cater-to-everybody france . 
  germany is actually the least pc about this immigration issue and its ramifications on discrimination . 
  what makes you think they 're pc about it , when even the chancellor goes on tv and makes very clear cut out statements about what kind of behaviour they want to project ? 
  well then , that settles it !, 
  we can call this headline a scientific law !, 
  you probably wrote `` sections of the left '' where what you meant was `` certain individuals '' . 
  i wo n't tell anyone . 
  you 're fine . 
  would you complain about it ? 
  wear and tear might get into some of them , but they 're very simple mechanisms , unlikely to suffer a lot because of environmental damage - which is , of course , a desirable property for a mine in the first place . 
  in other words , going is much easier than not going . 
  the same could be said about syria instead of croatia . 
  funny how war works . 
  what has orban solved ? 
  `` humanitarian help '' is a band-aid . 
  it does n't even push back the need for a solution . 
  distribution of immigrants is necessary , but good luck getting _ anybody _ to acknowledge this . 
  you forgot `` glory to arstotzka '' . 
  take him away . 
  nah , it 's fine , we can totally build a wall around the med . 
  just the _ will _ to `` protect our peoples '' is enough . 
  you would not be british if you did n't . 
  your summary presents certain assumptions as facts . 
  wrong choice of words - this will backfire on her party . 
  sharma is a brahmin surname , you 're thinking of _ shawarma _ , but it 's fine , a syllable wo n't stop you from making uninformed comments about stereotypical caricatures to which you match real people . 
   i 'm more curious about their morbid obsession with eastern europe . 
  why do they care so much ? 
   why did the us care about kosovo ? 
  in there is your answer . 
  of course , `` witnesses '' have a complete , representative , and objective view of the situation . 
  europol would have grandparent 's id in 15 minutes after they took a photo ( or fingerprints ) of him . 
   i am also a liberal and an atheist , i only mention that for full disclosure so you know where my two cents are coming from . 
  you are aware , of course , that your personal choices do not matter unless your opinion is already compromised by them , right ? 
  hell , why not 500k ? 
  why . 
  not . 
  million . 
  thank you very much for the comment and thanks for removing the post so promptly !, 
  it was just a simple , if crude , experiment which will not be repeated . 
  cheers !, 
  good morning sir , do you have a minute to talk about the concept of wages ? 
  as part of military service , i was trained in handling weapons and have fired a few : rifles ( ca n't remember which , i guess it was the standard hk g3a3 ) , m60 machine gun , a barrett m95 a few times .

  singularlogic . 
  look up who own it . 
   and after them another real government will take over . 
  a government of humans . 
  and humans are not gods . 
  that means mistakes . 
  mistakes ? 
  again , it was all deliberate . 
   wait for a messiah and you will wait forever i 'm not waiting for any messiah . 
  are you waiting for the government that is destroying greece to suddenly save us ? 
  you will wait longer . 
   i get the impression i am talking to a golden dawn voter well , you get the wrong impression then . 
   that has not read anything related to greek and western geopolitics . 
  i like to see these things from all perspectives and decide what is wrong and what is right . 
   it would take more than a reddit comment to explain how damaging this will be to our nation . 
  what would be damaging ? 
  leaving the eu or nato ? 
  well , if we actually had a good government , we would have stopped all this from the beggining . 
  until we get a real government , one that actually cares about this , we ca n't do much . 
  still , i think it 's wrong to give in to them . 
  let them join the russian sphere of influence . 
  and if they join western institutions as ` macedonia ' we should still not recognise them like that , and simply leave those institutions if we are members . 
  the solution is for them to find a name for themselves . 
  one that is not already taken . 
  there are many to pick from . 
  `` vardarska '' is ok , i think . 
  as long as it 's not anything related to macedonia , or anything else that is used , or was used by others . 
  i strongly dissagree with your suggestion . 
  `` new * something * '' implies that colonists , settlers or refugees from '' * something * '' arrived in a new land and called it `` new * something * '' , to indicate that they do n't forget their origins , history and identity and to honour their previous home . 
  generally speaking , it shows a relationship between two places , even if the relationship is only historical . 
  in this context , however , these people come from a totally different place and are in no way related to us . 
  they are not settlers , colonists or refugees from macedonia . 
  they are descendants of migrants who arrived * near * macedonia from elsewhere . 
  what would `` new macedonia '' indicate , if not origins from macedonia ? 
  since when are countries named after the nearest province of the country they border , when they are related to neither that country nor that province ? 
  you said it is a good compromise . 
  but why should we even reach a compromise ? 
  we were minding our own buisness , having macedonia as a region . 
  then they came in the balkans as bulgarians . 
  and now they claim macedonia . 
  why should we compromise ? 
  would an established company try to reach a compromise with a small buisness that claimed the same name ? 
  or would they sue them ? 
  and if we go along with this , what 's next ? 
  will we give in to everyone who has an identity crisis ? 
  what part of our history will we sell next , to satisfy people who do n't respect us ? 
   i 'm proud to be european guys wait , how many guys are you ? 
  do they want to join norway ? 
  or do they want to form their own country ? 
  more trust ? 
  how about no trust ? 
  thank you . 
  we do , but there was no such restriction in this case . 
  for more recent times , i 'd suggest someone from the heroes of the revolution , like [ theodoros kolokotronis ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bf/kolokotronis_statue_athens.jpg ) . 
  i see , thanks !, 
  do n't serbs use the cyrillic alphabet ? 
  it 's hard to pick one , but alexander the great is a good choice . 
  on an american website . 
   if libya does n't accept them back does any of them even come from libya ? 
  they all come through turkey . 
  and i 'm not talking about their country of origin , but the country from which they enter . 
  do we need permission to not let them cross the sea border ? 
   if they do n't accept , you ca n't send them back without . . well . . invading them . 
  but if illegal immigrants come here without our permission , it 's not an invasion ? 
  why ? 
   how do you push people back in the water ? 
  you just them back behind the water border and let them there in the sea to drown ? 
  what are you talking about ? 
  they will return to turkey . 
  after this happens a few times , it will be known that they ca n't enter greece like that and they 'll stop coming . 
   you can if they have papers . 
  if they do n't ( which is usually the case ) they wo n't accept them so you ca n't send them back by plane . 
  well , then we 'll keep them in camps until they get bored and leave on their own . 
   you ca n't just take your coastguard boats , violate the other country 's waters , land on their coast on your own and drop off 5000 unknown people . 
  we wo n't violate anything . 
  we simply wo n't let illegal immigrants violate our waters . 
  the same thing happens on land borders , too . 
  if you try to walk into bulgaria without papers , wo n't they stop you ? 
  and if you walk 10 metres in , wo n't they send you back ? 
   imagine a reverse situation where smugglers take people from greece to turkey and then the turkish navy just comes in greek waters , lands in chios and drops off 5000 immigrants/refugees . 
  if they stop them at the border , they have every right to push them back into our waters . 
  not land them on an island , but push them back . 
  that is what i suggest we do , too . 
  as for those who have already arrived here , we can find their country of citizenship and send them there by plane . 
  what do you suggest we do ? 
  let everyone in ? 
   given their current approach , as soon as they see a boat they would start harming themselves to be admitted to hospitals . 
  this is no solution . 
  there should be no exeptions - otherwise those exeptions will be exploited . 
  you 're right , i thought of this after i posted the message . 
  a better sollution would be to treat them in the coastguard boat , or send them to turkey for treatment . 
   we have to when their boats are sinking . 
  when they sink their boats , we should collect them and ship them back , without taking them to greek soil . 
  unless someone desperately needs medical aid . 
   yes , let 's invade turkey or libya and disembark some thousand refugees there . 
  what could go wrong with forcefully going to other countries right ? 
  is n't it our right to stop people at the border and not let them in ? 
  as for those who already stepped on greek soil , we could also send them to the country they are originally from . 
  not let them enter the country . 
  it 's what we should have done .

   a place where people celebrate the christian holiday , christmas , the supposed birth of the christian lord ( spoiler : not his actual birthday ) and saviour jesus christ . 
  have you been to one of them ? 
  they are not places of worship . 
   definitely nothing christian about those markets , especially in germany . 
  there is obviously something christian about these markets , just as there is obviously something christian about europe . 
  the point is , is this an attack on christians ? 
  so tell me what makes you think this is an attack against christians . 
  do only christians go to these places ? 
  do christians go and enjoy gl\u00fchwein more than e.g. 
  religiously unaffiliated people ? 
  do you know what is the religious makeup of berlin ? 
  there are no childish opinions . 
  everything is relative , all opinions are equally valid . 
  welcome to the brave new world !, 
   and seeing as 1/3 of somali immigrants from the netherlands honest question , how can they move to the uk if they are not dutch citizens ? 
  i do n't think this is the `` right '' , because merkel is also right-wing . 
  surprise surprise man , she is a right-wing politician !, 
  so , things are not so simple as `` left vs right '' . 
  second , i honestly do not know which is this `` other '' side you speak of . 
  i do n't think there are two sides in this . 
  even if i did , it is crazy two suggest that both sides ( whoever they may be ) are somehow equal in their moral substance . 
  you ca n't really expect a system to have a perfect 50-50 balance from its two sides . 
  but that is a totally different discussion and i am getting carried away . 
   some people might consider presenting the mere idea that immigration could be considered a problem as a result of these events to be `` gross '' . 
  which people ? 
  i think you are attacking a very convenient strawman here . 
  and this seems to be your modus operandi , since many of your posts are of this nature : complaining that you are labelled as something bad ( e.g. 
  racist or nazi ) when simply trying to `` discuss immigration '' . 
  this does not seem to be happening . 
  if you are talking about / r/europe , you have not been paying attention . 
  this has not been happening here . 
  if you are talking about places other than / r/europe , i wo n't argue , since i can only comment on the * real * discussions that take place here . 
  what is the point ?!, 
  i 'm not sure we have the same point in mind , hence this confusion . 
   you ca n't say side x is gross for doing y , when group z also does y. yeah this is called whataboutism . 
  look it up . 
  the only political exploitation of the dead happened by the side known as populists i.e. 
  trump and the afd in this case . 
  if you know of any other example , please tell me . 
  i have been asking for like 5 posts now . 
  i am not denying anything . 
  i am not implying anything else . 
  and if you think all this is `` irrelevant '' then please do n't respond . 
  you do n't have to respond , you know . 
  you can always just downvote . 
  correct me if i am wrong , but that is what downvotes are for - posts that are irrelevant and thus do n't contribute to the discussion . 
  did someone actually say that or are you putting up that strawman again, 
   all i did was ask you questions in a neutral tone nope , you wrote long rants . 
  i answered your question , but somehow you are still mad . 
   well , i wish you a better day than you had so far !, 
  thanks . 
  i hope your day was is as good as mine , but reading your posts , i doubt it . 
   and i just said the same happens on the other side . 
  and i asked for an example , in regards to this attack . 
  i even admitted that yeah , generally speaking , all sides do this . 
  i did not deny that . 
  still , you guys got offended at me asking a question and downvoted me . 
  not that i give a shit . 
  i 'm just pointing out what kind of emotional divas you are . 
  ca n't even handle a question . 
  you brought it up . 
  so maybe take a look at your wiring first ? 
  i 'd answer , but i see people already took your post apart . 
  nobody forced you to do anything , man . 
  at least have the dignity to admit that much . 
  ok let me make this easier for you , because it seems that complicated sentences make you mad . 
  i * assume * that this was related to isis . 
  i imagine their motivation was the same as the nice attack . 
  you can google that for more details . 
  so you are bummed out . 
  you know what bums me out ? 
  talking to you bums me out . 
  you sound like a very bitter and frustrated person , talking shit to random strangers in most of your posts . 
  so , unless you manage to write a post that does n't disgust me , do n't expect a reply . 
  again , you start from `` people are worried about immigration '' and arrive to `` christians are under attack '' . 
  how do you do that ? 
  and thank you , at least you did n't get mad this time . 
  that was more than i expected . 
   it does n't matter if it was against christians or not . 
  the potus mentioned it and his believers believed it . 
  so , it matters . 
  also the afd is running with the same rhetoric . 
  you ca n't ignore this shit . 
  that 's rich . 
  what is your concern ? 
  being accused of `` racism '' on an online forum ? 
  because that is all you talk about . 
   so then you do go to berlin to attack christians if you perceive people there to be predominantly christians . 
  that 's your impression . 
  i said nothing to that effect . 
  listen if you wan na complain about being religiously persecuted as a christian victim - go ahead . 
  i can only argue with facts . 
  you were not forced into the eu, 
  you mean , the * perceived * role western nations played . 
  because germany played no actual role in that shit . 
  isis ( or terrorists in general ) is not concerned with such facts , they will keep targeting europeans indiscriminately . 
  i thought this was common knowledge ? 
   people are actually worried about the effects of immigration please explain how this is connected to `` christians are under attack '' . 
  i would bet any amount of $ that you will not do that , but will get angrier and insult me and others you politically disagree with . 
  i mean , you seem to do that when you are pushed in a dialectical corner .

  i mean the fact that we see this behavior , even in the west , repeatedly occurring , should tell you that it is not as self-correcting as you think . 
  the price to pay for lying is insignificant , especially if you are a politician . 
   [ gays in ottoman empire ] ( http://i.imgur.com/hf3qiki.jpg ) i see the alt-right was active in the ottoman empire, 
  that is pretty ironic considering the far-right are intolerant , yet they demand they are tolerated or even respected, 
  you can simply punish them if they give out false information , intent be damned . 
  if you are a politician you are expected to know what you are talking about i.e. 
  how much money the uk gives to the eu . 
  it is a simple , objective fact . 
  it is not a promise . 
  it is a fact . 
   and the ammunition the admission gives to their political opponents . 
  this is great in theory but fails in practice . 
  just look at any politician ... ever . 
  they do n't require ammunition to attack their opponents , they attack them regardless . 
  their opposition is ideological , not practical . 
  they do n't . 
  liars can be pretty successful , see : politicians, 
  then they should make that very clear . 
  you should n't be allowed to campaign if you do n't represent objective reality in your rthetoric i 'm not saying they should be hanged or jailed , just not let them campaign but then again , we all know that if their slogan was `` the government should fund the nhs more ! '', 
  then brexit would not be a thing . 
  it would be a useless slogan . 
  democracy without an informed population is useless . 
  but i understand you like it because if propaganda is morally and legally accepted as a perfectly tool in the quest for political dominance ( as per the right wingers ) then the populists tend to win ; you are fine with that because they represent your views . 
   therefore the indigenous population has to be replaced or they should just stop believing in shitty ideas thinking that people are wrong is hardly a call to genocide and replacement of them . 
  this is textbook conspiracy theory . 
  for example , the `` concept of the family '' is not the same as `` ethnic nationalism '' . 
  i honestly ca n't imagine how you conflated the two, 
  come back komsu and bring order to the balkans again please, 
  to be honest the humour is pretty obvious , unless you are salty, 
   if you 're female and attractive more like if you have one or several orifices , you are a target, 
  the same way you do it in cases of perjury ? 
  persecuting people for lying is hardly a novel idea . 
  it 's just that some politicians ( or their lackeys ) want to convince us that they should be allowed to lie . 
   the idea that you can prosecute your political enemies for lying during a national debate is worrying . 
  the idea that you are fine with politicians lying - without any consequences - is what is worrying . 
  there are many instances during the 20th century where a dishonest representation of reality , pushed by politicians or intellectuals , was incredibly damaging . 
  orwell was prophetic and is still very important , i 'll say that much . 
   there are all sorts of problems with trying to legislate what people are allowed to say to win an election . 
  if you made lying illegal the candidates would constantly be trying to sue each other for telling lies and every election would turn into a legal case where whoever has the best lawyers can say what they want and others have to stay quiet . 
  has this ever happened or is it just speculation ? 
   how the fuck do you expect to maintain a proper democracy when you let politicians get away with blatantly lying about things ? 
  you are implying that they * want * to maintain a proper democracy . 
  do you really think that is the case ? 
  this is a group of people who barely squeezed a 2 % advantage and now demand everyone else ( the 48 % ) shut up , say nothing , just obey as they implement their agenda without any compromise . 
  these are [ the same people who demanded a second referendum if leave narrowly lost ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36306681 ) !, 
  and now they are utterly dismissive of any `` soft breakup '' with the eu , a breakup that would better reflect the wishes of the entirety of the population and not just the 52 % . 
  for these people , winning is all that matters . 
  everything else is just details that will be sorted out after they win . 
   its a `` solution '' unacceptable to many ~ ~ people ~ ~ politicians in europe ftfw i know the alt-right brigade gives a different impression but in fact many people want this problem solved instead of burying our heads in the sand ( and getting angry about it too ) like the nationalists would want, 
   i could say the very same for pro-choicers you could , but it would be wrong you are totally free to * not * get an abortion and not do crossfit ( btw wtf was that ) but you are pretending to be a victim here to justify your shitty politics, 
  why do you have to interpret anything as an attack on you ? 
  do you really think people want to destroy your family ? 
  or its concept ? 
  i mean how do you even destroy abstract concepts . 
  please re-read what you wrote and tell me if it sounds a little ridiculous . 
   family and culture to name two very important concerns of many people . 
  that is looking at the world from a populist lens . 
  culture and family are important to most people , regardless if they are poor or rich . 
   with that said , i think more information is definitely better , but i would not go on to say that those who possess more knowledge are intellectually honest . 
  i would far more wish that i have as a leader an intellectually honest individual than a highly intelligent , morally vacuous finance whore . 
  this is anti-intellectualism . 
  having more information is obviously better . 
  is this really debatable ? 
  have we reached the point where we are actually discussing if * being educated is better * ? 
  and you mention some intellectual pitfalls technocrats fall into . 
  no disagreement there . 
  but do you understand that this is a human thing ? 
  uneducated people often glorify `` common sense '' and ideology/tradition/religion as sources of knowledge , something that is clearly wrong . 
   changes need to occur in a peaceful manner or we are heading over a cliff . 
  when people told you about these problems you dismissed them as lazy bums , reds , useful idiots , communists , traitors etc. 
  marxists have been pointing out this problem for literally centuries , but your people used machine guns on them as a response . 
  and yes i know i am generalizing but i 've seen your opinions and the agenda you push - i can honestly say that it is dishonest . 
  you are pretending to adopt an economic or even rational platform for your concerns when in fact your concerns do not extend beyond these so called `` millions of muslim rapists '' . 
  but you have reddit . 
  that must count for something right, 
  it is weird is n't it ? 
  there are a couple of romanian posters that angrily argue against each and any refugees receiving assistance from the eu ( not even their own budget ) . 
  it is insane because some decades ago , the romanians were our `` muslims '' so to speak . 
  no one thought highly of a corrupt , post-communist country in a state of disarray . 
  they were considered anything from thieves , burglars to gypsies , or just a general burden on europe . 
  and now these posters talk like they are defending `` their '' europe from invaders ? 
  it is weird how quick history changes during our lifetimes , and how small memories the right wingers have . 
   no , eu leaders ' idea of a mandatory migrant quota is a bad joke . 
  it is a solution to a very important problem . 
  refugees need to be managed responsively and fairly bu all eu member states , so that my countries like my own wo n't collapse under the weight of the new arrivals . 
  we have to thank the right wingers and populist across all europe for torpedoing this plan and angrily preventing * any * solution to the refuege crisis . 
  we know why you do it too . 
  by preventing a solution , you maximize anger , frustration and hysteria . 
  this gives votes to the right . 
  if we had a rational solution , the populists would be hiding in their closets , since they would have nothing to scream at . 
  allright i 'll be happy to drop the insults and jabs if you address these points . 
  i expected you to bail out of an argument that does not go your way , citing hurt feelings . 
  if your emotions were hurt because i said `` great leader '' then you can just ignore these two terribly offensive words . 
  the point remains that the brexiters supported this , they demanded to be heard as part of a perceived large minority . 
  and i say `` perceived '' because as it turned out they were a small majority instead . 
  so please do n't be offended by my choice of words . 
  anyway this will come back and bite you . 
  the vote was too close for a too important issue . 
  public support will start taking a hit once the negotiations start and the negative effects of brexit become apparent . 
  the 2 % extra votes you squeezed out are not enough to get you through this .

  and in every case there 's a cost-benefit evaluation that needs be made . 
  it 'd depend on other things with how big the group is that murders and oppresses , how big the group that gets oppressed into doing these things , how big the group that enjoys same things voluntarily without harm . 
  do n't confuse specific customs with moral superiority . 
  which foodstuff is banned is just custom , not something that our culture decided upon after careful moral consideration . 
  pigs can be at least as intelligent as dogs . 
  if there was a group who murdered women for * not * wearing bikinis , like there are groups who murder women for not wearing burqas , i might support you in this . 
  i 'm sure there must be nudist beaches where bikinis are indeed banned . 
  and allowing burqinis is pandering to the islamist terrorists . 
   why ? 
  i just do n't see what benefits banning something like this has . 
  do you understand the benefit of having ages of consent , and the justification for those ? 
  or the benefit of banning sexual relationships between officers and subordinates in the military ? 
  the idea is that some people will try to coerce or pressure other people of doing things they may not want to do . 
  burqas and burqinis are one of the things , that a certain group of people is forcing another group of people to wear . 
  it 's impossible to figure out who is being forced , coerced or pressured into wearing these things , but we know there are lots and lots of people . 
  so we ban it , the same way we ban sexual relationship with subordinates in the military , same way we ban sex with people under a certain age . 
  is it perfect ? 
  some women might honestly prefer to wear a burqa or a burqini even without pressure or coercion . 
  but it has its justification , that such a ban helps protect those who do n't . 
  you 've posted the same comment so many times . 
  fix your first two goddamn links already which are pointing to the same image . 
   if no then how would one differentiate between these surfing suits and a burkini ? 
  how did * you * differentiate them enough to call them `` surfing suits '' rather than burkinis ? 
   so , simitis was good at economics ? 
  in comparison to andreas papandreou , and kostas karamanlis the 2nd , and alexis tsipras , yes , much better than all of them . 
  http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/will-united-russia-become-a-fascist-party.aspx?pageid=438&amp;n=will-united-russia-become-a-fascist-party-2008-04-15  in his 1992 article `` left nationalism , '' dugin defended fascism as not having anything to do with extreme nationalism . 
  it was , according to dugin , `` by no means the racist and chauvinist aspects of national socialism that determined the nature of its ideology . '' the `` excesses of this ideology in germany are a matter exclusively of the germans , '' explains dugin , `` while russian fascism is a combination of natural national conservatism with a passionate desire for true changes . ''  [ ... ]  he presented himself as a follower of the `` third way '' and called national socialism `` the fullest and most total realization '' of the third way . 
   [ ... ]  in his 1997 article `` fascism -- borderless and red , '' dugin hailed the arrival in russia of a `` genuine , true , radically revolutionary and consistent , fascist fascism . '' further affirmative phrases can be found in dugin 's numerous other writings on russian and international fascism . 
   why do you call him a fascist ? 
  well for starters because he openly advocates for a new `` genuine , true , radically revolutionary and consistent , fascist fascism '' . 
  it 's not as if he 's hiding his fascism , alexander dugin openly proclaims it . 
  frankly almost the whole greek political establishment is in the pocket of russia , and you can never hear a greek politician ever say anything remotely negative about russia at all , when instead they bash the west for * everything * . 
  the current greek foreign minister invited the russian fascist alexander dugin for lectures , and the current greek prime minister was standing by the side of putin in a press conference , as putin was speaking threats against fellow nato members like romania . 
  the russia-loving is bitterly ironic because of course the greek prime ministers who are most responsible for bringing greece to the state that it is , were in fact the most pro-moscow ones of them all ( andreas papandreou , kostas karamanlis the 2nd , now alexis tsipras ) , while the pro-western prime ministers ( e.g. 
  mitsotakis , simitis ) were much better where the economy was concerned . 
   well if it does n't happen in france , why would it have to be reacted to in france ? 
  honor killings have happened in france also , you fucking bozo , by the fucking islamist pigs who think their womenfolk are too `` westernized '' . 
   that accomplishes nothnig except unreasonably limit the choice of women who thought they would move to a country where they are free to live their lives for a change . 
  oh , right the `` choice of women '' is what burqinis are supposedly about , and not islamist murderer pigs who want to oppress their women , supposedly . 
  well , frankly the western world is n't required to accept the bullshit excuses of islamist murderer pigs . 
  the burqas and the burqinis are not about women 's choice , they 're meant to oppress women , and us sane ones are n't actually obliged to pretend otherwise , unlike the appeasers of the islamist murderers . 
  nothing to do with the islamic state specifically , it has to do with all the islamist murderer pigs who oppress women , and who would murder them if they dared go on a beach without a burqini . 
  but , hey , it 's not the french state that is doing the killing and the oppressing , so what the fuck do you care about the victims of such , right ? 
  are these attires forced by any significant group on any other group ? 
  if not , then they should n't be banned . 
  if yes , they should indeed be banned , as otherwise you 'd be enabling this coercion . 
  the reason the burqas and burkinis should be banned , is because a group of islamist murderer pigs is * forcing * them on women . 
  perhaps after the whole of the islamist murderer pigs have themselves been killed , and there 's not a hint of islamist tyranny anywhere in the globe , then we can consider reallowing them ( in case anyone anywhere actually likes wearing the things without coercion ) . 
  in theory , you 're right , in practice it seems that allowing them to `` dress however they want '' enables tyrants that force them to dress in one particular manner , and which want to force all women to dress in one particular manner . 
  so in theory you 're right , in practice you 're horribly wrong . 
  it 's so very cute how you represent countries fleeing to nato because they fear russia , an an aggressive expansion of nato . 
  the countries in question stayed right where they are in their internationally recognized borders . 
  it 's russia that has been invading and tearing apart every country that does n't have nato 's protection , first moldova , then georgia , then ukraine . 
  a brief period of peace between moldova and georgia was because russia was busy with chechnya , and once that was done , the stretch of annexations and invasion began again . 
  nato 's decision about kosovo ( a ) was wrong ( b ) came after many years of serb-kosovo warfare ( c ) came after serbia 's own imperialist aggression against its neighbours , bosnia and croatia , earlier in the decade . 
  the proper parallel with crimea is actually hitler 's annexation of sudetenland , tearing apart a peaceful country that never harmed anyone because of his imperialist ambitions and justifying it with some principle of self-determination when hitler/putin actually brutally forbids separatism from his own soil . 
  and yes the sudetenlanders were happy to be annexed by hitler too . 
  if you want to justify the annexation of crimea , think very carefully if you want to justify the annexation of sudetenland by hitler too . 
  one-leader rule , to the point that he controls the whole apparatus of the state without checks and balances : check . 
  effectively one-party rule : check militarism : check . 
  ideological opposition to social liberalism : check . 
  allowing private enterprise only to the extent they are directed by the state to the state 's agenda : check . 
  treating everyone who disagrees with russia 's wars as a traitor : check . 
  murdering opposition and journalists : check . 
  setting up false-flag attacks to justify wars of aggression against neighbours ( see ryazan incident where russian agents where caught red handed planting explosives as part of the supposedly chechen apatment bombings ) : check . 
  do please explain in what way russia is n't fascist . 
  and after you explain that , please explain why all the neonazis ans other fascists across europe love it so much . 
  what a coincidence that one of the leaders of the brexiter loves fascist russia . 
  like all the leaders of brexit have been loving fascist russia . 
  such a fucking coincidence again . 
  right , she mentioned brussels and has an eu flag , but you bozos are going to pretend that 's not what she meant , because which anti-euer ever cared about the fucking truth ever , anyway . 
  if you wear clothes that hide every part of you except your genitals you 'll still be arrested for public indecency even though you are not naked . 
  if you wear transparent clothes , likewise . 
  european countries forbidding the public display of women 's nipples or the genitals or the anus is n't different in kind to saudi arabia forbidding the display of women 's hair , or qatar forbidding the display of knees or shoulders . 
  or are you gon na tell me qatar does n't have a dress code either ? 
  so it 's not a `` public dress code '' if you are forced to cover up parts of the body , but it 's a public dress code if you are forced to not cover them ? 
  i do n't think you are consistent in this . 
   i should also be free to walk naked but that 's a different topic . 
  i think it 's the exact same topic actually . 
  countries have public dressing codes . 
  well i do n't know where you live , but try leaving home wearing nothing but a hat next time . 
  i 'm betting you 'll get arrested for `` public indecency '' or some such , pretty much anywhere , except as i said , clothing-optional beaches . 
  reasonably sure in germany it 's also illegal to wear clothes with nazi symbols . 
  the reason is that they associate burkinis with islamism , and islamism has been recently murdering lots and lots of people in france . 
  some european countries outlaw nazi symbols because nazis killed lots and lots of people , and if islamists keep killing people , islamist symbols are gon na get outlawed too . 
   should we have a public dress code do n't most countries have a public dress code everywhere except in clothing-optional beaches ? 
  all the haters of the eu were simply lying about hating it for its lack of democracy , or whatever , which is evidenced by how much they adore putin . 
  in regards to brexit , putin 's agents had a crucial role to play , as the ally of corbyn and putin 's agent , seumas milne , ensured that labour would n't actually do anything to vocally oppose brexit . 
  so , yeah , the brexiters have been the unwitting pawns of putin , ( except for those ones who were the knowing pawns ) . 
   yea , that 's the unthinkable i mentioned in the op . 
  why be coy about it ? 
  we 're trying to communicate here . 
  that 's what they said about brexit , too . 
  that having been said , i do n't think trump will win . 
  but it 's not impossible . 
   you do n't actually think i 'm even remotely persuaded by the arguments of the pro-apk nutjobs on this board , right ? 
  what i think is that you utterly , blatantly , failed to answer all of my questions . 
  what did turkey do * now * that it deserves sanctions , when it previously did n't ? 
  somehow erdogan did n't deserve sanctions when he was allied with the islamist gulenist mob against the secularists , but he deserves sanctions now when he 's allied with the secularists against the islamist gulen ? 
   every time one of you posts on reddit , the rest of reddit hates your country a little bit more .

  that 's not right either , but still , i will spare my tears for elsevier 's editors . 
  the system has been flawed for waaaay to long to justify any kind of sympathy . 
   peer review and sustaining a quality journal costs money writing the paper is done by the authors . 
  formatting the paper according to strict rules is done by the authors . 
  reviewing the paper is done for free by referees . 
  correcting the paper is done by the authors . 
  even auxiliary illustrations or journal covers are done by the authors . 
  all this work is provided for free . 
  the journals merely coordinate the communication between authors and reviewers , proofread and post the pdf on their glorified blog . 
  that should n't cost billions . 
  yeah but it 's dramatic, 
  the problem is that they are for-profit journals . 
  why does it have to involve profit ? 
   you do n't have to publish with elsevier if their fees are too and who is going to convince your next funding source that your work is reputable ? 
  it 's a chicken and egg problem that can not be broken with a single actor . 
  the long-term solution is to officially fund open-access journals , make them recognizable and respectable . 
  regarding long-term , i do n't know what is long-term to you , i ve been using scihub for years, 
  they can still charge the authors for publishing, 
  sciencedirect is often down for me as well . 
  plus i hate their website . 
  create a bookmark in your browser 's toolbar with this address : javascript : window.location = ` http://sci-hub.cc/'+window.location it will instantly download the paper you 're browsing from scihub, 
  they question is why journals want to fund themselves like that or why should they be funded anyway . 
  open access journals like the wonderful e-life , plos etc charge a processing fee per article published . 
  and they offer better service than elsevier , that charges a lot more . 
  a reasonable fee of $ 1000 / article is generally not objectionable by scientists . 
  you do the right thing in your country . 
  equality and la\u00efcit\u00e9 are lessons to be learned , they do n't come from god or spaghetti . 
  if you read that article , everyone uses it even if their library has access . 
  it 's because it is faster and it has everything everywhere . 
  most scientists do n't care to keep making elsevier and springer richer , they want to publish their fuckin results , but the funding committees still live in the 19th century where everything had to be printed in forest-paper . 
  i literally do not know of any scientist or researcher who would n't gladly break this law in this case . 
  the problem is not fixed with mandatory open access . 
  elsevier charges $ 5000 to make your article open access immediately , and ~ $ 2000 to make it open access in a year . 
  so they will keep making their taxpayer-funded profits even with open access . 
  thats a very protest-able situation in the year 2017 . 
  ( btw most eu funding bodies ( like the erc ) already require open access publishing since many years ago ), 
  i get that you 're trying to be empathetic , but please empathize with those south of the greek border . 
  they also love alexander the great , who was born in the region , and phillip , and the star of vergina ( again , in the region ) and speak their language . 
  regardless of ethnic/genetic background they have objectively a vastly greater claim to use the name . 
  there is no such thing as `` being macedonian '' , it 's all about what they claim to be and how well they justify it . 
  while fyrom nationals do form a distinct identity , the name they use does not describe their culture or themselves , it 's a rather arbitrary chosen name in comparison ( that they did not even choose themselves ) . 
  should specify that open access should be free too . 
  journals like cell charge $ 5000 for publishing an open access paper . 
  $ 5000 of taxpayer money for what is basically a blog post they dont even write . 
  sci-hub . bz sci-hub . io keep trying . 
  [ its everywhere ] ( http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/04/whos-downloading-pirated-papers-everyone ), 
  people are looking for his grave for centuries . 
  are you sure ? 
  `` country mccountryface '', 
   the people call themselves macedonians and have done so since the late 19th century at least that s disputed and most of them would identify more as bulgarians at that time . 
  the [ macedonian identity ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/macedonian_nationalism ) was hardly a self-identification anyway , it was promoted by various other countries that had interests in the area . 
  the recency of the idea , the relative fluidity of their national identity and the fact that it doesnt have deep roots in their society makes a case against being empathetic to their claims imho . 
   it removes the '' mecedonian '' identity the truth is that they have very little connection to macedonian identity , the historical sites of ancient macedon , the symbos they use ( alexander , the vergina star , phillip ) . 
  it 's a completely made up identity that was useful for tito to keep them united and which is convenient nowadays because it creates a national myth that people can adhere to , rather than breaking up the country / going to war . 
  it still has no historical or cultural basis however , they could have equally embraced any other made up identity . 
  the only real argument is that it keeps the country united . 
  but like all lies , it will create problems down the road ( cue irredemist claims/nationalist aggression whenever politics in the country do n't go well ) . 
  we already have erdogan , we do n't need another country to worry about . 
  we understand the whole dispute sounds ridiculous to most europeans , but you are not their neighbors . 
  it 's not unheard of a country to be named by the name of a locality . 
  most do . 
  you can understand the reason , we would be confused otherwise ( we have a major region called the same ), 
  and for some there is a [ sinister concept behind it ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_macedonia ) . 
  the broader reason is that the region of macedonia was disputed as it came out of the ottoman empire . 
  that name has `` greece '' in it . 
  unacceptable . 
  if time has proven anything it 's that it 's a very bad choice of name . 
  there is irredemism behind the name , there is historic forgery , there is blatant nationalism and populism of the worst balkan type . 
  all this because of the choice of name and the ensuing propaganda , not because the people of fyrom are some kind of warmongers . 
  to what extent has the idea of [ united macedonia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_macedonia ) become extinct ? 
  worth noting the amendment came after greece protested the language of your constitution . 
  specifically you still have article 49 :  the republic cares for the status and rights of those persons belonging to the macedonian people in neighbouring countries , as well as macedonian expatriates , assists their cultural development and promotes links with them . 
  the republic cares for the cultural , economic and social rights of the citizens of the republic abroad . 
   the very possibility of changing country 's name . 
  fyrom is a new country , hence they have not yet settled a name or a national myth . 
  they forged one which is crumbling . 
  it has no cost to them to settle on a different name now . 
  you do n't put saudi arabia in your car ? 
  and how would u encourage them ? 
  you 're right , got is too mild for the balkans . 
  they re territorial as well, 
  vetoes were created for this exact reason . 
  something similar happening with northern cyprus . 
  or else the un would not be a community of peaceful nations . 
  best part of macedon , or bestia, 
   should change its name and identity technically they are not changing it . 
  they were never `` macedonia '' in the un from the get go . 
  it 's a naming , not a re-naming . 
  nobody else would feel close enough ( territorially linguistically and culturally ) to claim the name greece . 
  plus modern greece did not start a crusade to reclaim `` our '' colonies in southern italy and france . 
  do you really feel the name `` byzantium '' or `` roman empire '' would be a better choice ? 
  game of thrones is a good approximation of balkan history, 
  fair . 
  but i m saying , on aesthetic reasons , that any composite name would feel like a diminutive . 
  like , not many would like to live in `` little britain '', 
  the problem is that their entire nationalist idea hinges on the history of ancient macedonia which is located squarely inside modern greece , and they have been pretty aggressive in promoting the idea of a possible ` restoration ' of some former glory by erecting statues of alexander everywhere , using macedon emblems , naming things etc etc. 
  maybe if they had not been so blatantly aggressive the greeks would have a different stance . 
  remember the balkan borders are all relatively new , and this kinds of blatant irredentism is certainly destabilizing . 
  it 's our biased opinion that not giving into these crazy nationalist ideas actually helps stabilize the region . 
  how about `` vardar republic '' .

  just search for zilan or dersim and you will know what i mean . 
  i do n't understand why praising european leaders who did something wrong is '' wrong '' but when we consider a megomaniac like ataturk who stole greek culture it is '' a hero who revived turks ! '', 
  most states in the world do things that are not legally possible . 
  think of usa 's nsa or britain 's intelligence . 
  in what way is it not possible ? 
  the software they use to declare passports unusable do n't have a '' only if citizen is not in britain '' button . 
  it 's pretty much possible . 
  the uk is n't somehow blocked by an invisible world ombudsman who will automatically stop them . 
  it 's just that the uk can be sued , which is another thing . 
  iirc this teacher was innocent but many '' teachers '' that operate are not just teachers like we know from the western world . 
  turkish teachers are appointed by the state ( who is now led by erdogan but before it also happened ) , and one of their ` tasks ' besides teaching is gaining knowledge on the people in that region . 
  they gather information of the children and when they get to know children or young students who are pro-kurdish rights , they play this information to the government . 
  in the past that led to an unspecified amount of kurdish civilians being abducted , kidnapped and killed by the turkish state . 
  keep in mind , it is not that long ago that kurds were called mountain turks and that the kurdish language was banned . 
  until this day , speaking kurdish in many parts of turkey will get you lynched ( not even by the police but by the people ) : ** '' turkish nationalists beat compatriot after presuming him to be kurdish '' ** : http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/turkish-nationalists-beat-compatriot-after-presuming-him-to-be-kurdish.aspx?pageid=238&amp;nid=88199&amp;newscatid=341 ** '' ankara police quash protests after mistaking spanish narcos theme for ` kurdish music '' ** http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/ankara-police-quash-protests-after-mistaking-spanish-narcos-theme-for-kurdish-music-.aspx?pageid=238&amp;nid=110089&amp;newscatid=341 these type of ` incidents ' are daily events in turkey . 
  imagine then that a teacher comes and gathers intelligence on you which they then send to the state and then you become one of those victims lynched , tortured or attacked because of your ethnicity/culture . 
  so , it is not without a complete goal that pkk have sometimes targeted teachers who happen to be ` useful idiots ' used by erdogan and other turkish leaders . 
  poland is actually the future of europe . 
  with or without the government 's policies . 
   you can not deny the exceptional amount of work both sides have made no , turkish cypriots ** want ** peace but turkey does n't . 
  there is a difference between the two . 
  it 's not for nothing that erdogan has been flooding akp islamists into cyprus . 
  turkish cypriots were never in favor of the turkish imperialism . 
   the usa is only marginally lower than turkey there are also a thousand times less americans than turks in germany . 
  if 1 % turk crime increased , it would far way more impact germany than american crime . 
  in addition , americans do n't create paralel communities like the turks in germany do where they literally curse germany . 
  russia has its own problems with turkey and actually lays claim to constantinopolis . 
  russians only accept alliance if turkey will be a junior partner . 
  knowing turkey 's racist , xenophobic and imperialist governments they will not bow down to russia 's demands and thus an alliance is not possible, 
  business insider : http://www.businessinsider.com/ahrar-al-sham-in-syria-and-turkey-2015-10?international=true&amp;r=us&amp;ir=t veruscript :  the first of these leaked phone conversations provides the basis for the allegations around turkish-sponsored support for an array of armed groups . 
  this leaked conversation was published following suspicions reported by various media claiming that trucks containing weapons and other military-related supplies were crossing the border into syria unchecked .22 given that this part of the transcript was released by rt some time after the conversation took place , it can be assumed that there was an element of political mischief . 
  turkey 's mainstream conservative newspaper , hurriyet , even acknowledged the matter with an article on the turkish opposition leader 's claim that the content of the transcript was no `` state secret . '' 23 indeed , upon its publication there was notable interest from other international media outlets from the new york times to reuters . 
  this led to increased speculation that the mit was behind the operation , given their historic links to the military and border security units . 
  https://www.veruscript.com/journals/journal-of-intelligence-and-terrorism-studies/turkish-intelligence-approach-in-the-syrian-conflict/ http://www.businessinsider.com/ahrar-al-sham-in-syria-and-turkey-2015-10?international=true&amp;r=us&amp;ir=t, 
  no , you contradict yourself and dont know anything about history . 
  you claim that cyprus was never greece 's yet claim that turkey existed for centuries . 
  i wasnt the one making that comment . 
  i just responded to the stupidity of your logic . 
  it 's actually very much in context . 
  because the arguments turks use , is in contradiction to their own policies when they deal with other people . 
  you live in a fairy tale if you think that the eu is going to allow erdogan and other turks to continually threaten and crush the eu . 
  that was decades ago , turkey 's support for isis , al qaeda , ahrar ash sham and other islamists hasnt end until this day . 
   do you really think war is the answer when all sides of the conflict are around the negotiating table and willing to do something ? 
  the turks are not serious in the negotiations . 
  they want cyprus to remain a satallite state of turkey . 
  in addition they refuse to deport the turkish settlers who dont belong on the island . 
  we saw what the weak russian sanctions did to turkey . 
  turks literally begged russia for its tourists . 
  just imagine what some european sanctions would do . 
   it is being allowed to occupy european union land because the greeks threatened to shut down any new members from joining the eu unless cyprus was admitted regardless of the status of northern cyprus . 
  the eu did not want to admit cyprus until the issue was solved , but the greeks forced their hand . 
  how does that in any way change what i said . 
  first you say '' turkey ruled these cities over centuries '' while turkey didnt exist 100 years ago and then you say greece never ruled cyprus meanwhile cyprus is greek majority . 
  lol you are just embarassing yourself . 
   as said , if kurds are so afraid , no one holds them hostage , they can leave anytime they want . 
  i have a hard time believing they 'd have a better time in greece where they ca n't feed their own people . 
  20 million people leaving to greece ? 
  why would the people born there leave so that turkish imperialists go inhabit those areas like they did with north cyprus ? 
  the current topic has a direct link with what i said . 
  turkey , the [ terror supporting country ] ( http://www.businessinsider.com/ahrar-al-sham-in-syria-and-turkey-2015-10?international=true&amp;r=us&amp;ir=t ) has no moral ground to '' liberate '' people based on oppression yet oppress others of those same freedoms it claims to come for . 
  i 'm asking the question . 
  why does turkey feel the need to liberate turks in cyprus but treats its citizens with the same methods as the '' oppresers of turks in cyprus '' ? 
   the eu ca n't really do much . 
  the lionshare of turkeys trade is with eu countries . 
  turkey has a customs union with us that we can cancel . 
  contrary to russia 's gas depedence , the eu has no dependence on turkey whatsoever in terms of economy . 
  and if needed , eu countries can launch a military operation to once and forever end turkish imperialism in cyprus . 
   you can have them if you are concerned about them , deal ? 
  right , by the same treatment as the armenians , assyrians and greeks got ? 
   ** bedo gesaratsi , an armenian from turkey , views the issue from an interesting perspective . 
  he told al-monitor , `` calling one an armenian is killing two birds with one stone nowadays . 
  anyone opposing the state deserves the treatment armenians once received . 
  ** read more : http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2015/10/turkey-armenian-kurds-minorities-forced-to-be-turkish.html#ixzz4nnpmscdu, 
  it 's the greatest shame to the eu that even until today a terrorist-supporting country [ [ 1 ] ] ( http://www.businessinsider.com/ahrar-al-sham-in-syria-and-turkey-2015-10?international=true&amp;r=us&amp;ir=t ) accused of crimes against humanity targeting civilians from a 15-20 million kurdish population [ [ 2 ] ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/human_rights_of_kurdish_people_in_turkey ) is being allowed to occupy ** european union land ** . 
  we will never be able to handle russia out of ukraine ( a non eu country ) if we even cant the defend our own territory against the turkish imperialists, 
  do n't forget about the 15-20 million kurdish people living in fear , oppression and racism . 
  why dont they deserve the same '' liberation '' as the turks in cyprus ? 
   yes . 
  after greek coup d'etat which aimed the annexation of the island to greece . 
  it 's funny because this is literally what the hypocritic turkish state does when talking about mosul and kirkuk , iraqi cities . 
  so why does turkey have a '' legitimate '' claim on cities with barely a 20 % turkish population but do greece have no legitimacy for a place with a greek name , majority greek population and greek history ? 
  i could also talk about turkey suppressing kurdish identity and culture or atleast claim that kurds should deserve no country ** yet ** invade other countries in order to '' safe turks from assimillation '' but you already recognized that turkey is wrong in occuppying cyprus . 
  no wonder , turkey has been plagued with a cult culture since its existence . 
  according to muslim leader erdogan yes lol, 
  the comment i referred to was about immigrant muslims , not about homegrown ones . 
   umm , here in nyc we have shitloads of hardworking muslim i didnt say that there were no hard working muslims . 
  i was referring to the immigrant muslims ( somalis etc ) . 
  hardworking muslims ? 
  muslims in us arent hardworking at all . 
  one of the largest growing muslim population in the us , the somalis , have huge unemployment rates and are generally on welfarehttp : / / www.wnd.com/2016/05/refugees-sending-suitcases-of-welfare-cash-home-to-somalia/: im not even talking about the terrorist attacks by muslims in the us . 
  mexicans are actually the hard-working ones . 
  they do the shittiest jobs for the lowest pays and dont complain . 
  several western media spread that lie . 
  he 's not blaming syrians in any way , he refers to the lie that leftists tell us about how all migrants are syrian and 1/3rd of them are doctors and rocket engineers . 
   this is why the opposition will never win another election if they continue the racism towards kurds . 
  kurdish population only growing to . 
  the dude mhp 's existence is on their xenopohbia towards other ethnicities . 
  only difference between akp and mhp is that mhp is more turkocentric and will sympathize less with arabs . 
  yes , people with weapons are only terrorist if they kill turks . 
  if they kill other ethnicities , it becomes '' an operation by the descendants of the gokturks to defend the motherland '' .

  pls clarify . 
  before these elections , pasok had 160 ( and later 155 ) members out of 300 , but still required nd to vote with them in order to have a representation of  50 % of greek voters . 
  still , people cried foul . 
  apart from the shit-storm to be generated when the 37 % votes on any measures , do you think our lenders will feel safe with such low representation ? 
  i think golden dawn gets most flak , and they deserve it . 
  my point is that the pr shit storm scales according to the craziness of the political claims of syriza . 
  kammenos for example , ( from another anti-austerity party leader ) claims that he will get the money needed for running the country from china and russia . 
  for this specific claims he has been ridiculed exactly like syriza was . 
  my point is that they are getting exactly the same shit that papandreou got when he said `` there is enough money - lefta yparxoun '' . 
  it is syriza 's first time in the wilderness of governance , and their first ` solutions ' got the flak they deserved ( imo ), 
  greek banks are low on capital ( to be precise , unless they get a 50bn recapitalization loan after the losses of psi + red loans , they are fucked . 
  actually we , their customers , are fucked ) . 
  syriza totally ignores this simple fact , and says the following : a. 
  we are guaranteeing deposits ( lol with what ? ), 
  we are going to use said deposits for recapitalization ( through loans to business ) of the market . 
  ( apart from saying indirectly `` get your money out of greece '' , this point is in contrast with point ( a ) ) . 
  mr. stratoulis of syriza said the above , and in his 2nd statement about this , his only correction was that the idea will affect accounts with more than 200,000 e ( oh nice !, 
  rich people get your money out now ! ) . 
  another member of syriza ( glezos ) said that his proposal is for accounts up to 20,000 e ( oh even better !, 
  everyone get your money out ! ), 
  the letter had no specific point , it talked about the result of the elections and what they think people want ( at least their 17 % ) . 
  not a single word about intent . 
  if syriza had a point to make to eu , this was the time and place . 
  i was expecting at least one sentence like this : dear eu , we will cancel the current monetary deal . 
  thank you for your help so far , we can manage on our own . 
  kisses xxx syriza 3 . 
  venizelos is a slow hippopotamus ( huhu ) about every reform and action but he never denied the fact that we are cornered , we need the money , and we will have to accept our lenders ' terms 4 . 
  samaras is booed by 50 % of his own party ( as seen from the election resutls ) , and the sum of the european conservatives . 
  he is probably the 1st politician who lost while getting the 1st place . 
  conservative newspapers ( of all ) portray him as an idiot . 
  do n't know about this , no comment . 
  they did n't and that was fraud ( against their customers ) . 
  still , currency was irrelevant . 
  they did n't and that was fraud ( against their customers ) . 
  still , currency was irrelevant . 
  they were guaranteeing the euros in the bank accounts by signing a treaty and adhering to some eu standards . 
  if i have 1,000,000 usd in my possession i am free to lend you some of it . 
  if i am a bank and i lend you more than i have ( banks do that , but there is a limit on the exposure they are getting into ) , i am committing fraud . 
  nothing to do with the currency i am lending . 
  as long as they ( icelanders ) can not print cad , there is no problem . 
  the problem is not caused by european citizens wanting to enter greece without a passport ( we call them tourists , they leave when their vacations end ) . 
  the problem is caused by immigrants going through our border with turkey . 
  the thing is : turkey is not prosecuting them . 
  so for all practical purposes on the matter of prosecution , greeks can block their passage to greece and leave them on turkey . 
  journalists had the right to leave the premises ( and they should have imo ) and the nazi party had the right to dictate its rules in its own building . 
  too much fuss for nothing, 
  he is by definition : he is not a greek citizen and he does not have a visa . 
  i could make exception if he had the turkish army marching behind him , ready for the kill ; but this is not the case as we all know . 
  fun fact : greece did not have an immigration inflow problem with mine fields across the borders . 
  also , there were no people been blown to pieces , because no-one dared crossing . 
  any chance of answering my question ? 
  you have to cross the sea which can be patrolled . 
  edit : most immigrants pass through the northern border with turkey ( evros area ), 
  do you have a better solution ? 
  the above has been used for the greatest part of the 20th century with good results, 
  if you place land mines along your border and clearly mark them , you will find that people will follow their common sense , and not cross . 
  i have thought about placing the signs , without planting the mines , but i guess someone with a machine gun could call the bluff easily . 
  true for the last 15 years, 
  `` never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity '' ( or incompetence if i may add ) . 
  greek here . 
  the content of the article just describes the usual inefficient , bureaucratic greece . 
  the point where the two leading parties reserve more ballot paper for themselves is typical entrenched party people in the workings of the state . 
  hmmm let me think : whose money do these banks hold in their vaults ? 
  austerity is the result of deficit ( s ) . 
  austerity is the word we use to describe government spending cuts when the government does not have enough money . 
  thinking that austerity is causing the financial problems , is like saying that the fever is causing the flu infection, 
  sorry mate but you are all discussing on my fucking original post , which is about practicality . 
  if you want to discuss about something else please do , just do n't comment on my post . 
  the last sentence is just an argument from authority fallacy , but i guess that is just a dent in the overall stupidity of your post . 
  human here . 
  i hope you realise you are out of topic : practical language . 
  i can not use a language if i can not read/write ( maybe i can pick up some chicks , but i can not even read a newspaper or do business ), 
  what would be practical for a taa speaking person to learn as a foreign language ? 
  i found english to be easier than french and german ( which i quit very quickly ) . 
  chinese ( and the rest of the oriental languages ) have so many characters that make it impossible for me to learn how to read . 
  as a common mortal who speaks greek natively , english as a second language , french at a very basic level , and who has looked at chinese , allow me to say this : it is fucking easy . 
  no genders , simple rules on past tense verbs and composite words , to name a few . 
  try learning german , greek , chinese etc. 
  the only other simple language i can think of is italian , since you are just waiving your hands 50 % of the time :-), 
  it is the easiest language . 
  we use it because it is practical . 
  edit : attention linguist down-vote brigade : there is a word in my post above ( practical ) . 
  stop flooding me with info about how easy chinese is , when it is impossible to learn thousands of characters in order to read/write ( which is very practical ) . 
  thank you, 
  nationalisation : works wonders / s, 
  lol imf occupation : financial bureaucrats with their laptops are indeed scary ahahahahahaha, 
   in the moment when the greeks were n't able to pay the debt and threatened to take `` not guilty '' countries down too you can not make a threat when you have only one option : `` we have no money to pay , and we threat that we are not going to pay '' : no shit sherlock !, 
  so what ? 
  you can call it whatever you want , there in no jail for countries so you do n't need an excuse like that for a ` judge ' . 
  the moment greece goes bust ( for whatever excuse ) : 1 . 
  no more lending to greece to cover current deficit 2 . 
  no more loans from ecb to greek banks --  greek banks go under --  citizens/business loose all their savings --  crash 3 . 
  possible trade sanctions, 
  i wonder what this is going to solve since we have no plan for mass deportation , and no plan for better border patrol . 
  i guess the rise of extreme right wing parties got politicians scared enough to put out a `` show '', 
  you keep twisting my words : the one harmed is not allowed to seek revenge ( feedback from my post : softer penalty , i.e. 
  a penalty is given ) , but if he did , a judge may go easy on him with a milder sentence depending on the prior actions of the victim . 
  this is exactly how our justice system works . 
  if you allow any third party ( apart from the state ) to take the law in its hands , you will end up like west africa . 
  this is why i dislike solving an injustice with a crime .

  even if that was the case , erdogan could have helped his country achieve those goals to be ready to access the eu . 
  if the eu was still denying turkey entry , * then * he could bitch about it and have a valid reason to do so as well . 
  no , he 'll gather only a certain amount of these people and spend the next day denying he claimed 100,000 would follow him . 
   ... aiming to raise 50 billion euros . 
  o_o they 're gon na buy the whole continent , are n't they ? 
   what can turkey , which has been kept waiting at the door of the european union for 53 years , expect from the west ? 
  well , if turkey went along with the [ eu acquis ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/acquis_communautaire ) that all current eu members had to go through to be accepted into the union , then they would n't be `` waiting at the door '' for so long . 
  i would n't call russia `` loved '' by us . 
  we just do n't hate it like most of europe does . 
  he 's certainly not as talked over as bush or clinton were , so i guess this is a good thing . 
   not really that `` new '' though , they have been in power since 2012 has n't your government been ruling china since 1949 ? 
  close enough . 
   plus , many european languages have names for the city starting with * [ b - ] * . 
  for example , breslau ( german ) , boroszl\u00f3 ( hungarian ) , breslavia ( italian , spanish ) , et al. 
  makes sense , since wroc\u0142aw 's latin name ( in some old documents ) is * bratislavia * . 
  i feel like it should also include average climate and weather conditions . 
  it 's definitely an important factor when it comes to choosing where to live . 
  a ghost !, 
  catalan modernisme is such a funky and unique architectural style . 
  i love it !, 
  i do n't know . 
  i did n't expect tallinn to be placed above toronto for me , but it did . 
  not exactly the same . 
  putin already had the majority of the people 's support when he started turning his country into a pseudo-democratic authoritarian state . 
  he also did it with lots of political support , slowly over many years . 
  even today , it 's hard to say when the tipping point was . 
  erdogan , on the other hand , is hasty and sloppy . 
  he has only about half of turkey on his side . 
  his autocratic shift happened too quickly ( he went from mild to extra spicy in just 4 months ! ), 
  and his support from the political spectrum is still on the fence . 
  if this keeps going on , turkey 's instability could fully fend it off its allies and throw it into large social unrest and even civil war in the near future . 
  and modern china . 
  there are 9 legally recognised political parties in the prc , but only the communist party governs the whole country . 
  my 12th match is the first one outside europe . 
  oh , yes they did ... * the independent newspaper article from 1993 : * http://static3.businessinsider.com/image/52a1c37869bedd476f5aaefd-960/independent-1993%20 ( 1 ) -1 . jpeg, 
  a tad oversimplified , but prety good all-over . 
  yeah , books ... sure . 
  and a hotter accent ( standard dublin accent , at least ) . 
  then i 'd go with * breslavia * . 
  that 's how italians , spaniards , and portuguese call it and it rolls off the tongue nicely in english . 
  family guy [ ruined ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vryp3pa-pyu&amp;t=0m07s ) my perception of this piece . 
  or we could go with irish english and give england a double middle finger . 
  i 'd love to visit troms\u00f8 during aurora borealis season . 
  the city looks very picturesque and clean , and it 's close to many natural parks and beautiful fjords . 
  i also understand that the climate is milder ( due to the gulf stream ) than it is in other areas of similar latitude , which is a plus . 
  true . 
  i 've barely ever seen anyone with a blazer , let alone a white one . 
  you can refuse no matter the case as long as you present a justifiable reason . 
  the swiss are rich , happy and their tax system works very well . 
  the greeks have a bad economy , are unhappy , * and * the tax system works like shit . 
  your point ? 
  i never said i want her to cut the deal . 
  i 'm only saying the reason she did it . 
  not to spare greece ( she does n't give a fuck about us ) , but to save her career . 
  what makes you think it 's low quality ? 
  are you insinuating germans have more potency than immigrants ? 
  if anything , statistics show us quite the opposite . 
  immigrant stallions in dire need of 100 $ , i 'd assume . 
  `` well you have been replaced . 
  i do n't need anyone now . 
  when i delete you maybe i 'll stop feeling so ~ ~ bad ~ ~ . '', 
  hopefully not many turkish citizens are as defeatist as you . 
  * `` he 's a son of a bitch , but at least he 'll keep most of these refugees from coming to germany long enough for me to clear up my public image until the next elections . 
  '' * that 's what she thought . 
  i agree . 
  we should have never been allowed into the ez , but the eu was willing to bend the rules ( allowing us a 3.1 % deficit during entry instead of  3 % ) to let us in . 
  they did that knowing full well of the implication , so both sides need to be blamed for this . 
  after the fall of the socialist states , the west/east sociopolitical divide started moving further east . 
  starting from the [ 2004 enlargement of the eu ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2004_enlargement_of_the_european_union ) this became clearly defined . 
  the [ un definition ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7a/europe_subregion_map_un_geoscheme.svg/680px-europe_subregion_map_un_geoscheme.svg.png ) looks pretty apt to me . 
  i love how the thumbnail depicts him crowned with a halo of eurostars ... 
  most of you who bothered to vote . 
  the ones who did n't vote decided to leave the outcome to the rest , so they do n't get to complain . 
  some of us do n't want to see you leave either , but most of you decided against remaining , so now we all have to live with the consequences . 
  only google search can claim the title of `` greatest front page of the internet '' . 
  it 's still assumed . 
  the main reason turkey believes it was g\u00fclen who was responsible for this is erdo\u011fan saying so . 
  most likely not . 
  there are a couple of things that may give them away , but they 're not that prevalent . 
  it 's not real recovery . 
  most of that 4 % down from 2013 comes from [ underpaid part-time jobs ] ( http://www.keeptalkinggreece.com/2015/10/14/part-time-rules-in-greek-labor-market-half-a-million-employees-have-to-live-on-less-than-e400-per-month/ ) . 
  you mean griko ? 
  yes , it 's a nice little gem in the area . 
  it sounds like a mixture of greek and italian in accent , but it 's pretty much standard greek heavy on the italian vocab . 
  sadly , it 's declining fast and it 's mostly found in local songs nowadays . 
  probably not when it comes to accent , but definitely among the top 3 when it comes to native languages and dialects . 
  accents ? 
  not really . 
  it 's almost exclusively among older generations and people living in remote rural areas that may have sort of different way of speech . 
  cretans , rhodians and people from the ionian islands traditionally have a more musical way of speech , but the first one is declining and the other two are almost fully gone . 
  pretty much all greeks from all over the country understand each other , unless they get to use their local dialect ( not the same as ` accent ' ) in which case it becomes harder . 
  seriously , though . 
  i think italy is the most linguistically diverse country in all of europe . 
  that 's true . 
  it 's usually easier for italians to understand written french and spoken spanish than the other way round . 
  he chose an odd time to do it considering what / u/rorschachsqt said . 
  it 's like he 's telling other islamic countries to move forward to reach turkey 's progress while he 's making his country move backwards and lose big parts of this progress . 
  maybe he 's trying to meet them halfway . 
  `` leader of country , whose systemic oppressive tactics against minorities has resulted in the creation and empowerment of a handful of terrorist organisations both inside and outside said country , calls the kettle black . '', 
  it was a nice middle finger to the eu .

  first he was . 
  but then after being a prime minister for 8 years he could n't be any more because constitution . 
  so he changed the constitution in such a way that gives more power to the president in comparison to the prime minister , and he became the president . 
  but then the time he is allowed to stay as president was coming to an end too , so he changed the constitution again with the recent referendum , so he can become the prime minister yet again , for infinity . 
  he 's been the leader of turkey for 15 years already , and if things keep going that way , he will remain for perhaps another 15 years , or even more . 
  he just makes up laws and changes the constitution any time he wants , so he can forever stay in power without practically becoming a `` dictator '' . 
  basically , he does what putin has been also doing all that long . 
  the government signed yet another series of even more austere austerity measures , yay !, 
  because they 're everywhere . 
  be thankful that these people just went outside the turkish embassy to protest , so they only got some kicks and punches . 
  back in 1996 people from around europe went to turkey 's borders to protest against the occupation of cyprus . 
  it did n't end well . 
  turkish soldiers started firing at unarmed protesters , shooting some un peacekeepers too . 
  you mean ` fists ' not feasts !, 
  :p a feast is where people come together to eat . 
  just tell him to not start imperial wars again . 
  perhaps koine greek then ? 
  that actually was a lingua franca at some point , and the new testament was written at it ? 
  there is such a thing as a european anthem ? 
  the bad thing is that a piece of this `` greekape '' was found on greece . 
  and i am from greece . 
  and do you know what will happen if i share this news story on my fb ? 
  the `` leftistantifascistliberal '' crowd is going to call me a racist and bully me probably . 
  because speaking about anything that could make you feel positive about your ancestry , country or nation is racist and fascist these days . 
  for both the africa and the europe story , i wonder ... why do people say that humans descend from that place , and then they go on to talk about x or y species that is not homo sapiens ( or even homo ) , considering that the human species is homo sapiens ? 
  it makes no sense and it 's confusing . 
  it depends on the part of athens . 
  the old city which includes districts like anafiotika , plaka , thesion , are awesome . 
  the rest is an ordinary city with gray apartment buildings and some ancient ruins here and there . 
  not constantinople . 
  by the way , is saint constantine and constantine the great the same person ? 
  i do n't remember . 
  here in athens we mostly drink wine and beer . 
  a very few people drink tsipuro . 
  still have n't met someone who likes ouzo o raki much . 
  this i do n't know then , and i ca n't have opinion about things i do n't know . 
  so now posting a thread from one subreddit to another is pkk terrorism too ? 
  please tell me you are joking . 
  there is also chicken gyro . 
  most probably you will meet the same kind of xenophobia all foreigners are experiencing . 
  the reason turkey has n't joined yet is because it does n't meet the standards . 
  and the reason it does n't meet the standards , is because its government has n't made changes that are required . 
  greece on the other hand met the standards to join the eu , and it became part of it . 
  but it did n't met the standards to join the euro and joined the euro by cheating a paper . 
  greece is punished for that cheat , with austerity . 
  he blames the result of his doings to others . 
  because the armenian genocide had the most victims . 
  i think ' it 's usual to happen . 
  nazis also did a holocaust against the jews , gypsies , homosexuals , and slavs , but often people only talk about the jews , because they had the most victims in the holocaust . 
  the ` persecution ' of turks was because turks were slavers , and the balkan peoples where rebel slaves wanting their freedom . 
  turks also enslaved african people . 
  the african people that were brought to europe as slaves of the turks , were not persecuted , even though they were muslim too . 
  up to this day there is a town in greece of black people that the greeks liberated from the turks . 
  http://www.enet.gr/?i=news.el.article&amp;id=415642 perhaps turks should n't see all people who were n't turks as inferior and enslave them . 
  but what did you expect ? 
  it 's reasonable when slaves rebel for their freedom to fight their masters . 
  anyone who has at least watched game of thrones knows that . 
  well you too invaded our homeland , burnt towns , and slaughtered people too . 
  the difference is that we were at at this place of the earth before you . 
  and that when we did it , at the places we did it , the majority in the local towns and cities had greek populations , so we did it to unite the local populations with the mother country , but when you did it , there were n't any turks living in the byzantium , and you did it just for the spoils . 
  it 's not accurate . 
  the mediterranean did n't existed , as the straight of gibraltar had n't opened for water of the atlantic ocean to pour into it . 
  one could walk from libya to italy back then . 
  reminded myself a political graffiti message i saw that was written during the 2nd bail out to ` save ' greece . 
  the graffiti read `` no more saving '' . 
  what massacre ? 
  give us your sources . 
  are there any photos ? 
  show some proof . 
  to satisfy erdogan 's ego , as also the inflated ego of the nationalists who follow him . 
  truth is , even if turkey somehow acquired 2-3 greek islands , turks would still get paid the same salaries , kurds would still fight in the east , and there would be nothing positive out of this for the ordinary turk . 
  but nationalism ... 
  it makes you want things that are absolutely useless , just for the shake of not letting the other one have them . 
  that would be if we were the same as them . 
  apparently for eu warning turkey , the eu claims the same thing too . 
  you are welcome . 
  it is true that some businesses dont give receipts . 
  that 's a real problem . 
  but it is n't the reason for a recession . 
  because that problem always existed , even at times greece had considerable growth and surpluses . 
  so the factor that is causing such big changes is something else . 
  ok then , let me tell you what the situation was . 
  first of all let me tell you that there was n't a single problem . 
  there were a number of problems . 
  you are correct that proportionally at least , greece 's public sector was larger than a number of other countries . 
  but this was n't really the main problem . 
  even before the austerity , there was another more important problem to the local greek market , and that was caused due to the combination of three factors . 
  one factor was that most greek businesses were ( and many still are ) introvert . 
  that they focused on the local market without caring / knowing , what happens to other eu countries . 
  a second factor is globalization , and a third factor is the spread of fast internet . 
  when the euro became a thing , along with it came legislation in our countries that would make trade between eu countries much easier . 
  so easy , that with the use of internet , someone could just order stuff from foreign shops quite easily , and take advantage of the reduced prices . 
  practically that increased competition very high , for all businesses in the eu , as each business since then did n't only had to compete with other local businesses , but also with businesses from the whole eu . 
  the result was that i could order for example the same exact thing from a foreign store through the internet at prices even as low as 1/3 of what local stores priced it . 
  that led local businesses to start suffering reduced profits quite much , and thus a market recession could already be seen at the horizon . 
  because of the reduced consumption that was a result of continent-wide competition , the money the greek government would collect from taxes started to drop , and that lead to a deficit . 
  to cover the deficit , the government wanted to take a loan . 
  but because its debt-to-gdp ratio had gone too high ( due to huge earlier loans it took for the recapitalization of private local banks ) , global banks would only provide a loan to greece with a very high interest . 
  at that point the then prime minister of greece , mr papandreou , went to the imf and asked it to help greece , so greece can take a loan with smaller interest rate . 
  eventually what they decided was that greece would instead take a loan directly from the imf , and greece had to apply some measures in return to that .

  bitches come and go , bro , but you know eu stays < 3, 
  well , you are free to believe in them , right ? 
  of course . . how did i not see that coming ? 
  there there , dont worry , the storm will go away . 
  sigh , so oppreseed and bullied . 
  `` the people in greece believe in zeus '', 
  oh , poor souls ... victims of xenophobia ... 
  ye , the agaean duet is a huge bureucratic shithole for/from refugees ... 
  call the spanish inquisition !, 
  dont worry my orthodox bro . 
  we eat fish today and suck it up , but next sunday we will show them what it means to celebrate through food hahahahahahahaha * laughs orthodoxically * hahahahah, 
  get jesus to touch you !, 
  well , you could still skip san marino , monaco , andorra etc. 
  the other three are countries with the regular sense . 
  you should have included the other 3 aswell , 
  i 've heard it 's the most expensive city in europe ( even topping london ! ), 
  before 2008 the split was west-east the it was defined by the iron curtain . 
  post 2008 we have north-south-east . 
  at least that 's what i think . 
  you think he misses the 90s ? 
  he is nostalgic about the good old 60s, 
  i really didnt dispute the malaka . 
  that shit is in every sentence, 
  damn it 's so beatiful ... i want to work and live in munchen some day ... 
  where is that ? 
  i agree on all your points , but do you really think that this is just a countryside thing ? 
  me too  jk i was good at school . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_crete also , the irony :d :  because of the heavy casualties suffered by the paratroopers , adolf hitler forbade further large-scale airborne operations . 
  however , the allies were impressed by the potential of paratroopers and started to build their own airborne formations . 
  what region ? 
  `` hellenic '' and `` greek '' is the same word ... it 's like saying `` hrvatski '' and `` croatian '', 
  thanks for the extensive answer, 
  i am not that comfortable with googling and searching from phone , but from \u03c6\u03b1\u03bb\u03bb\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf i undersrand that it is for the head ? 
  canyou please explain eli5 this meme frog everyone is posting ? 
  is he from 4chan or smth ? 
  i dont know what that is . 
  there are at least 3 major religions in the eu right now . 
  also i am no longer a teen though i understand that stereotype of the teen atheist that you speak of . 
  since when ir doesnt ? 
  what is making her non european and why you say that european is mutually exclusive to mideastern ? 
  so europe has a dress code now then ? 
  religion doesnt have to do anything to being european, 
  that is good news for bitcoin, 
  can you imagine what germany would be if he lost the austro prussian war ? 
  definately austria would be part of germany and wienn would be the capital of germany, 
  he would get allergic reactions with bad rashes etc and would have to leave :( ( ( (, 
  uk would vote for cameron to leave the house, 
  sure , the people want a democracy where everyone is free and equal , right ? 
  griechenland : griechisch singular : \u039a\u03b1\u03bb\u03ce\u03c2 \u03ae\u03c1\u03b8\u03b5\u03c2 plural or singular with formality ( kinda like the german `` sie '' ) : \u039a\u03b1\u03bb\u03ce\u03c2 \u03ae\u03c1\u03b8\u03b1\u03c4\u03b5, 
  you maybe already know this but just to be sure : we are talking 24 degrees celsius ( i assumed you are american because you said florida ), 
  we get more than 24 these days !, 
  wtf, 
  talk about pr :p, 
  greeks and turks that have internet access are the most progressive ones and i guess we are cool with each other . 
  now , i know some friends that are the stereotypical : `` argh . . turks , fuck that '' and they ** would ** have ... problems ... in first hand interaction with turks . 
  oh well , at least it is better than , say , 30 years ago ... 
  yes but i trick yuo brixelle !, 
  i am not trapped in here with yuo , you is trap in with i !, 
  xaxa grece yuo of genious, 
  how do you even tell if someone is a jew ?? 
  nice food for `` thought '' to the `` white supremacists '', 
  shouldnt it be area size adjusted instead of population adjustment ? 
  good old ball-of-many-polans joke . 
  people please dont make this a hatethread, 
  good old hooligan gear , 
  hooray for someone not putting the money factor to decide if eu is good or not . 
  whom are you including then ? 
  ah that is a very inteligent and nice pun , 
  50 reason greeks are loved by us, 
  haha in the greek part is doesnt mention the `` expensive '', 
  yes i happen to know econ101 . 
  i just asked if the index is adjusted to that . 
  me too o.o, 
  nice name , 
  is it always more open = better ? 
  genuine question, 
   how some greeks see germany maybe more like how media sell it . 
  and they try very hard . 
  and the equivalent german media make it sooooo easy, 
  or you know , they accepted it cause they can accept cold hard true facts . 
  unlike a lot of us, 
  the cross is there because the revolution ( which created the modern state ) was in the name of christianity ( and the people werent defined by the ethnicity , but by religion under ottoman rule ) . 
  the nine stripes are the number of syllabes when you say the revolution motto : freedom or death ( \u03b5\u03bb\u03b5\u03c5\u03b8\u03b5\u03c1\u03af\u03b1 \u03ae \u03b8\u03ac\u03bd\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2 , \u03b5-\u03bb\u03b5\u03cd-\u03b8\u03b5-\u03c1\u03af-\u03b1-\u03ae-\u03b8\u03ac-\u03bd\u03b1-\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2 = 9 ) . 
  blue because sea and white i guess it 's pretty generic, 
  you mean bloodline mix ? 
  my point was that just because they would have issues , it doesnt justify causing issues . 
  now we cant know it for sure now can we ? 
  i wonder why . 
   misleading peoples and parliaments by presenting a bank bailout as an act of ` solidarity to greece ' ** would turn germans against greeks , greeks against germans and , eventually , europe against itself . 
  ** the whole shittines summed up so well, 
  `` our goal as far as turkey is concerned is to help them on their way to european path '' - venizelos 1923 . since you say you know about history ( obviously paraphased ), 
  turns out money does bring happiness . 
  who knew ? 
  i just mean that the message is cool and all , but it is waaaaaaaaay more complicated than that . 
  also , most liberty vs security arguments get lost in the definitions despite the two sides really believing the same ( common sense ) stuff . 
  well , in 100 years from now middle east wont be a perfect society , but they will be killed less ( i hope ), 
  ahh ... balkans . 
  the middle east of 100 years ago . 
  churchill celebrate giving up part of czechia ? 
  that was done to avoid war wasnt it ?

  not an impressive * turkish * city . 
  turks were all nomads in central asia 5000 years ago ( if there even existed a concept of a `` turkic tribe '' by then ) . 
  let me drown in all that 35 % support . 
  it almost is n't universal disfavour !, 
  to be frank , belgium looks like it wo n't last another 10 years the past 200 years . 
  john oliver needs to do a `` belgium : how is that still a thing '' segment methinks . 
   are you trolling ? 
  why are you being aggressive ? 
   it does n't matter where the money physically is yes it does matter , actually . 
   it matters who has responsibility . 
  yes it also does , but it is unrelated to the first matter , so not sure why that is on the same sentence . 
   people who break the law have to see consequences of their actions and not just call their uncle in the finance ministry to get out of it . 
  and that is nice and all in theory but my comment 's point was n't about the morality of tax evasion but the practicality of combating it . 
  to put in layman 's terms : the money might as well be in narnia as far as tax collection is concerned . 
  fun fact : all the money of tax evaders is way outside of greece the past 3 years . 
  i work in the bank sector and , let me tell you , unless someone is completely moronic , it is impossible they will find anyone in the wrong for more than champ change . 
  any large amount of cash is no longer stored in greece but frozen in foreign accounts ( if they owners are even still in greece ) . 
  the only ones the operation will get are people rich enough to have tax evadable income serious enough to bring the government on them but not rich enough to get their money the hell out , like everyone else has already . 
  if that demographic even exists , which i doubt , it is minuscule . 
  did he get triggered by the croatian patriarchy or something ? 
  he also almost , to the day , predicted the fall of the german empire in his deathbed . 
   if this subreddit would really subscribe itself to foster integration , it should consider removing national flairs . 
  why on earth would the subreddit have , as a goal , to foster integration ? 
  i basically officially dislike the eu nowadays ( see flair ) but i still enjoy talking about issues pertaining europe as a whole . 
  you are trying to assign a goal to the subreddit that it simply does n't have . 
  that people misuse the term does n't mean the term is meaningless , just their specific use . 
  similarly , when actual sjw try , for example , to redefine racist to mean `` people who are white '' does n't mean racist no longer has a meaning , just that the way they use it does n't . 
  that is my view at least . 
  i think i have heard my granny use that one ... like , 3 years back . 
  agreed . 
  let 's not make sjw a meaningless term folks . 
  not pointless , but certainly really overused . 
  i would n't call the mod an sjw based on those rules but the rules do seem extremely heavy-handed and view pushing . 
  or maybe i browse tia too much where the word `` sjw '' has a full meaning still . 
  patata is also that in greek . 
  considering potatoes are a new world veggie , it is n't weird that most countries share the name of one of the colonial nations . 
  you are silly . 
  did you read that post ? 
  it calls religious practices worse than pedophilia . 
  it says all religious centers should be forcibly closed and the priests shot . 
  did / r/atheism fedora army invade the thread or are you folks completely out of your mind ? 
  this whole post is so rediculus , it almost becomes funny . 
  who upvotes this crap ? 
  yes , in fact , i have already done so and i am currently in canada . 
  yeah , we must shelter our boys to become become fat , mindless , protected and easy pickings !, 
  i shot my first gun at 6 . 
  it was fucking fun . 
  if it is done with the proper safety ( i essentially pulled the trigger , my father was holding the hand tight and leading the gun ) it is both informative and good for the child . 
  anti-gun attitudes comes from a place of hilarious ignorance . 
  i actually kind of like the turks . 
  we are too similar culturally to dislike them in any capacity other than ignorance . 
  that is personally , though . 
  politically , turkey and greece , simply put , do not have many common grounds and we have constant friction due to that ( way more so that 100 year old wars ) . 
  so while i do n't dislike the turks , i do n't think greece and turkey can become `` friends '' under this political grounds nor would it benefit us to be so . 
  also , as i have said somewhere else : pls gib cosntantionple pls, 
  i am actually one of those people !, 
  ok , not tax evader , actually . 
  i am one of those people with foreign bank accounts and loads ( in fact , almost all ) money outside of greece . 
  the problem is that i am no longer a greece resident but i still have property in greece ( for which i pay my taxes in full ) and a small amount of safe money in greece ( which i also pay taxes on ) . 
  considering how much of a clusterfuck the current system is , i kind of expect a letter asking me to explain my finances . 
  unfortunately , countries are n't good at communicating with each other in regards to tax purposes . 
  hum . 
  in the exact same category of toxic users . 
  also notice it is n't his views i mainly dislike . 
  i mainly dislike his attitude , which is beyond terrible . 
  i am a conservative and a right winger . 
  that said , i was quite disappointed with sarkozy 's performance . 
  he failed to address serious social issues , the economy of france went down the toilet and he had a high level of corruption . 
  he was n't destructive , like hollande , but he was severely underwhelming . 
  best of luck to france . 
  hope you chaps fair better than us . 
  is n't democracy wonderful ? 
  you got plenty of choice between hollande , sarkozy and le pen ( is mightier than le sword ) . 
  i think the best news here is the socialist party 's collapse . 
  a well deserved fuck you , really . 
   most of the times he is quite knowledgeable i would dispute that . 
   and provides sources though which either are completely unreliable , opinion pieces ( which are fine for discussion but not to base an argument upon ) or he just completely twists the contents of them . 
   and your comment is quite toxic itself . 
  i am sick and tired of him , but you are right , this comment thread is n't helping anything . 
  this is my last response . 
  i do n't dislike people based on views ... at least i try not to . 
  one of my best friends is a gall with whom i have n't agreed on a single major political issue the past ~ 2 years that we know each other . 
  what i do dislike is bad faith people who simply do n't care about anyone but themselves . 
  you could be promoting the `` hugging kittens society '' and if you acted like an absolute cunt , i would still tell you to fuck off . 
  naurgul believes he is `` persecuted '' by right wingers when , in fact , people are just telling him he is insufferable . 
  i ca n't talk for other greek users , but my opinion of him is not very positive , to say the least . 
  he openly believes that dialogue and discussion is useless and anyone who disagrees with him is an `` enemy '' he either has to convert or to expel . 
  he is n't here to promote discussion in the subreddit but to push his agenda . 
  his agenda which , i personally believe , is a horrendous pile of crap . 
  basically , he is the premium example of a toxic reddit user . 
  balkan simulator best simulator . 
  what are you t. ...  naurgul oh , yeah , never mind . 
  did you just equate ukip to gd ? 
  because lol . 
  yes , we have a great depression but that does n't make us third world countries . 
  trust me , i have been to plenty of 3rd world countries and it is n't even close to comparable . 
  no to both counts . 
  we are not even close to 3rd world and crime has actually sharply dropped . 
  my grand-grand-father got 3 bullets in those wars . 
  my grandfather says he never regretted it .

  as long as this does n't work , lashings on greeks gets you votes, 
  ha , not joking for sure many germans got inspired to go on holidays to greece or buy a greek wine because of that song . 
  for sure harsher measures will help / s, 
  the greek wine industry is owing that guy a lot, 
  v and his gang agreed though that a lot of restructuring is needed . 
  they also were elected to fight corruption that was well sustained by the previous government . 
  if they would have done some , even symbolic , moves there and cracked down against this , they could have had a good hand on negotiations , at least publicly . 
  i think the fact that so little was done did n't make syriza 's position too strong unfortunately, 
  do n't blame the murderer . 
  blame the weapon, 
  maybe it 's the end of the euro ? 
  maybe it 's it will be a wake up call to rethink our financial system ? 
  maybe it will call for accountability for all the countries ? 
  maybe it will be the beginning of a new europe that is not prioritizing wealth and money over its own people ? 
  maybe ? 
  i 'd like to dream, 
  i know . 
  i will update my post accordingly . 
  will see if true, 
  i am reading the spiegel for some time now and , interestingly enough , the english articles are way more neutral/greek-friendly than the german ones . 
  everybody knows it had no real implication and was rather symbolic, 
  this is something new for spiegel , that has been very hard with greece until now . 
  analysts already blame germany for the hard line stance . 
  in case of a grexit , historians will definitely blame germany for this behavior and it will be a dark chapter for the coming years . 
  ok , here is what i think : germany is playing super hardline now and threatens with grexit after greece accepted to take hard measures . 
  greece is being pushed in a corner , says no to the harsh measures . 
  germany is against the fronts and have to do concessions on the hard lines . 
  greece feels like it got something out of it and tsipras goes back as someone who at least could negotiate himself out of germany 's humiliating plans . 
  just a thought ... 
  so germany is turning full hardline ( * trying to avoid the word nazi nazi here * ) to show greece they are not full hardcline like greece was trying to picture them the last 6 months . 
  let 's forget our past mistakes here and ... oh wait a minute :(, 
  there is a new demand  fully comply with the medium-term primary surplus target of 3.5 percent of gdp by 2018 , according to a yearly schedule to be agreed with the institutions ; 3.5 % surplus to a dying economy is practically the deathblow to greece !, 
  what are they even thinking, 
  greece should become a bank . 
  then it would be easier to bail us out !, 
  the last 5 years are the ultimate proof, 
  cool . 
  more cycle jerk pls, 
  whoops . 
  got stupid : - s, 
  who decides such things ? . 
  greece should never get loans from slovenia , or any country , to pay the debt . 
  edit : slovenia ! = serbia :(, 
  oh man i know how you feel :[, 
  why not ? 
  in that way you shouldnt read any history cause events are always in a ` different time and situation ' . 
  why bother learning from our mistakes or successes then ? 
  shhhh ... dont say much . 
  lets be poor to make other countries happier . 
  we can all be poor at the bottom , maybe even be the poorest . 
  soon we can have more countries joining and we 'll be all looking up with a smile, 
  that tsipras only friends are fidel and the extreme right wing parties . 
  noone else is on his side edit : forgot word, 
  i am all in for depicting the complexities and realities of life in , often offensive , cartoons but in this case he has failed to make his point . 
  i doubt that a person dressed like that would depict the average greek politician ... but the average citizen, 
  http://www.thelocal.de/20150707/voters-back-schubles-hard-line-on-greece posting this here as mod removed my submission . 
  apparently germans like schaeubles hard line on greece and it actually attracts new voters, 
  yes but right now it is kind of eclipsing a lot else . 
  this would be a vital thing to discuss as it is one of the core apsects of the crisis . 
  shame not to have it, 
  added yes but i doubt this will be discussed and i would like it to be . 
  please dont unlist it, 
  as mentioned in another thread , there is a cultural difference here . 
  while pensions in northern countries are usually going to the pensioner to live and maybe do the old age travel adventure ( we get a lot of germans here ) in greece the pensions supports large parts of the family . 
  after a year of unemployement money you stop getting any . 
  we dont have any student loan schemes or any financial help . 
  yet , we are still alive and surviving on those ` high ' pensions . 
  yes our gdp is fairly low as well , that doesnt helpful the % if i would be syriza i would be syriza i would lower the pensions and move money towards unemployement shemes and studend funding , if the suits in brussels would allow me to : / also on another note , there is a big inequality on the pensions given as well and there are a lot of ridiculusly low pensions . 
  a median would be more welcome than an average edit : shite corrected, 
  while i suspect not a really representative survey , do germans really favour a party just on the fact that it prescribes austerity to other countries ? 
  i am actually scared about this, 
  the greek government nd that was in charge before syriza was corrupt to a large level , yet was being favoured by the eu commission and was heavily recommended by the eu to get elected as they were willing to push austerity . 
  all corrupt people by now have saved their assets and themselves from any punishment , either by transfering their wealth to lux or switzerland or just by reinvesting it in london flats . 
  by now its very difficult to do much as nd has never implemented mechanisms to beat corruption . 
  we are 5 years into the crisis , tsipras has promised he would beat corruption but me , him and most of us know its too late, 
  well i didnt stay there would be a spainxit ( omg that sounds awful ) but the demands from ( real ) socialist parties wouldnt sound to well with the rest of tge eu governments, 
  which ones are left ? 
  and please do n't show me social democrats - their ideology is far from leftist . 
  hollande is playing the sympathizer but he is following a similar line like most center right governments . 
  also ... in this case it depends what reality is for everyone . 
  i thought our european reality was full of unity and solidarity . 
  but i guess it boils down to spreadsheets i guess . 
  reality is what we as a whole create , and we chose money over people, 
  the spanish election is crucial . 
  they want to exemplify greece with a grexit or punish them in some way to scare off similar attempts to get leftist parties into power . 
  that is the idea of a democratic europe :(, 
  he has a bunch of bases on several islands in greece and its an important hub for military actions . 
  creating instability in greec might fuck up his big plans, 
  unfortunately many people find this whole period that means the collapse of a country as a joke to bash around . 
  haha , that will teach em syriza ? 
  bunch of retards greeks ? 
  all to blame , hope they suffer some replies are just annoying , some hurt a lot . 
  for me , as a european who has a lot of friends from england , france , spain , sweden and germany it saddens me . 
  this union wo n't be a union no more soon . 
  we greeks might leave , but there will be the next . 
  the next crash , the next crisis , the next one to blame and it will become easier to shift the blame to the weakest . 
  its depressing that we have reached that status . 
  its not the europe anymore our fathers built, 
  indeed . 
  it saddens me that so many redditors are absolutely sure about their analysis they gather from several media about what the cause and what the solution is .

  that 's how bargaining is done . 
  you do n't make concessions before you begin negotiations . 
  an eu agency however has no place in a country outside the eu . 
  i know its a drag filling the greek islands with color but thats exactly what gives a certain neighbor funny ideas / s, 
  i love that shit . 
  too bad someone has to die first : /, 
  expansion pack ? 
  is n't that how people use the daily star anyway ? 
  `` note '' as a recommendation or an order ? 
  i thought as much . 
  thanks !, 
  i feel a slight apprehension digesting news concerning the continent coming from britain lately . 
  can this be confirmed by a german ? 
  you can not deny though that he makes some very good points if you ignore the rant . 
  and he gives due credit to the erasmian view . 
  we like him more than we like others , 
  this dilemma should n't exist imo . 
  here 's a link between the `` established '' erasmian view and the koine/demotic version . 
  it 's worth watching it since it 's more concise than anything i can write here ( and only 5 min long ) . 
  it 's becoming a problem in rural areas and farmers are getting desperate . 
  that 's how it sounds in greek too but english speakers tend to say `` mu '' as in mew, 
  i ca n't see her carrying poo bags and i 'm concerned . 
  sadly , you are correct . 
  indeed but a desperate voter will probably believe an idiot 's sweet lies . 
  i 'd get into a heated debate with you but your username implies you 'd explode . 
  i trust my fellow greeks will never give them majority . 
  but them becoming third or even second largest party is sadly a real possibility if the public 's quality of living keeps deteriorating . 
  a bunch of retards . 
  what 's scary is not their idiotic ideology but people voting for them out of outrage for the incompetence of the rest of our politicians . 
  but that does n't stop them from multiplying : /, 
  hmm it looks like de facto greek clay to me . 
  greece can onto mars !, 
  granted , mars owes some explanations too . . 
  stop copying . 
  the lighthouse was first built in 1897 just off shore from a castle in andros . 
  the stone column on which it was built had been shaped by millennia of natural erosion into the perfect pedestal for a coastal beacon . 
  unfortunately the original lighthouse was not long for this world , and was destroyed during world war ii . 
  for a time , the rocky outcropping went without a proper lighthouse , and the fantastical image created by the former structure was all but lost . 
  however , the lovely beacon apparently had an extra life . 
  the lighthouse was eventually rebuilt in the early 1990s by an oil tycoon who dedicated the structure to his daughter . 
  the replica became greece 's first automated lighthouse , eliminating the need for an onsite keeper to operate the light . 
  but even with the modern upgrade , the lighthouse still looks like something out of dungeon and dragons , with the winding staircase hewn from the rock itself , leading up to the door of the tower .

  either air pollution too low to register ... ... or possibly off the scale . 
  lol thanks . 
  no effects whatsoever . 
  my conjoined twin agrees . 
  in other news , several european countries are reporting people shortages . 
  now now , language . 
  he totally deserved it . 
  on it 's own but hardly defenceless . 
  +1 stink defence bonus . 
  not to mention portability , floatability and ease of setup . 
  it 's kid friendly too . 
  i honestly read mafia and was about to praise it 's social agenda : /, 
  better than gib anyway lol . 
  would n't mind a union with eire . 
  i 've liked every irish i 've ever met , 
  but do n't you see ? 
  if greece leaves , then it has to fail big time . 
  because if greece leaves and succeeds ( best scenario ) , what 's stopping other troubled countries doing the same ? 
  what sort of sense of security does a monetary system with a revolving front door can provide ? 
  the market is mainly psychology and if its shaken , it can take a long time to recover . 
  mainly because article 50 has n't been triggered yet . 
  if your parliament votes not to leave , irregardless of the political backlash , then you 're in . 
  until art . 
  50 is triggered then britain is not even in the process of leaving in my opinion and i presume in many others ' too . 
  it 's not reluctancy to see you go . 
  it 's the time its taking the british government to do what the public demands . 
  and i agree ; we 're only having a friendly discussion on the matter , no harm 's done . 
  i 'll have to disagree . 
  from a technical standpoint you are actually out in name only . 
  negotiations have n't even started yet and actually being out will take at least as long as you mentioned ( ie 2019 ) . 
  i ca n't tell whether the decision of the british public was either good or bad but it 's what you wanted so i respect that . 
  and i 'm glad people are willing to stick to their decision through snow and hail because from the signals that major corporations ( be it banking , construction or manufacturing ) are sending , it does n't look good . 
  hopefully these are only baseless rumours and everything will be fine . 
  all i 'm saying is that it 's too soon for either celebrations or regrets . 
  you do realize that you 're still in though . 
  feeling lonely ? 
  it 's sad that most brits decided that the eu is the cause of their troubles . 
  in a sense i can understand this sentiment since there was a british empire until at least ww2 . 
  but it was the us that demanded they dismantled their preferential trade network in exchange for help against the axis . 
  it 's a dog eat dog out there and imo however much one hates giving up some sovereignty , it 's better than to stand alone . 
  i think a lot is in stake . 
  beyond the bilateral relations of the two countries and the cyprus talks , turkey has an upcoming constitutional referendum too . 
  an extradition of the eight could be seen as a victory to be exploited politically by erdogan . 
  i would n't want to be a judge in this case . 
  cause men would agree / s ( i did it again ), 
  touch\u00e9, 
  burger eating , probably . 
  i 'm sure those gals can take an innocent joke , 
  a country bitchfight ? 
  that almost sounds entertaining . 
  hopefully one day women will rule the world . 
  it 's far better to have a bunch of countries not talking to each other than actually going to war . 
  it 's very easy to find greece in these graphs/maps these last few years : /, 
  i like bedbug district , conveniently situated between youth and student town . 
  puberty district would be a more fitting name though . 
  technically it is a state because it does n't belong to any other state . 
  gim me washington dammit :p,

  you pay your debts using only money made through export surplus . 
  this has a two fold advantage as not only is debt payed through extra surplus money but it gives an incentive for nations to invest and help greece boost their exports just like what was done to germany post ww2 so not only greece benefits but both european investors and creditors . 
  well for the under-30 's who are facing 60 % un-employment and never-ending austerity and great depression , nobody did actually ask them . 
  now do you want to punish the future of greece and think it will work out long-term ? 
  you could i suppose but why do that if it is not needed . 
  why not allow greece to pay back its debt using debt repayments linked to export surplus like germany received post ww2 . 
  why did germany get the chance to stand on its own 2 feet after murdering half the continent but greece can not because they have made such a terrible sin ? 
  you would think germany of all countries would think twice before forcing a new treaty of versailles onto a nation . 
  but irony knows no bounds apparently . 
  the only time the question of bailouts was put up for a vote could have happened in 2011 . 
  the prime minister announced a referendum on the bailouts and a week later he was silently kicked out of office and replaced . 
  new leaks from lagarde list indicate he was blackmailed due to hiding money in secret swiss accounts . 
  did euro 2004 really make portuguese that bitter ? 
  the most hatred against greece comes from portugal which i find odd . 
  as far as greece reclaiming democracy like the person you replied to , that has nothing to do with this current referendum , the eu still has 80-90 % approval rating in greece . 
  also that `` geography '' has had greeks living on it thousands of years before `` classical '' greece , and will for thousands of years more . 
  when germans got their debt cleared by greece after massacring 1 million greeks , it was different ofcourse . 
  all greece has to do is massacre a few million people to get their debt forgiven correct ? 
  if troika wants a plan for greece which allows it to grow while paying back the debt , preferably under varoufakis planned growth-bonds or like in germany post ww2 where any debt was payed back solely off export surplus that would be ideal . 
  if troika wants to make greece suffer for another decade with no hope then the debt can not be payed back . 
  as far as the `` greece did not do reforms '' meme , [ greece was ranked # 1 in reforms by oecd in 2013-2014 ] ( http://coppolacomment.blogspot.com/2015/02/reforms-bloody-reforms.html ) . 
  greece managed to close the 14 % deficit to 1 % surplus in 3 years using mainly cuts through reforms proposed by troika which previous government implemented fully . 
  and yes the law on entering/exit eu is very very clear , if greece did not have cyprus in the eu than i would not be as confident but in the end the eu can not lose greece due to geo-politics . 
  because if greece is forced out the eu , there would be russian military bases in greece before the next week . 
  greece has n't received outside aid since august 2014 and i doubt again any time soon, 
  eurozone = / = eu the reality is that eu law is extremely clear about how to enter or exit the eu , and there is not a single word in any eu document that relates the eurozone to eu entry or exit . 
  before you post for the thousand time the `` legal expert '' who thinks it `` inconceivable '' to exit the eurozone and not eu , the problem is that eu law is extremely clear about this matter . 
  i do n't think you understand greece 's role in the eu geo-politically to be thinking of eu exit or the fact that there are two greece 's in the eu with cyprus . 
  stay in the eurozone , the eu has nothing to do with upcoming sunday vote . 
  is there a live stream ? 
  edit :[ found one ] ( http://rt.com/on-air/protests-no-referendum-greece/ ), 
  [ a mysterious spike in the shares of a small canadian pulp and paper stock is rumoured to foretell an exit of greece from the euro zone . 
  ] ( http://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-investor/investment-ideas/spike-in-fortress-paper-stocks-may-be-built-on-shaky-foundation/article24463037/ )  fortress paper 's stock has taken off in recent days despite the lack of any material catalyst , aside from speculation the company is positioned for a deal to print new greek banknotes . 
  `` should we continue to support german banks which over-lended to greece with german tax money '' yes/no they should at least be factual if they are going to spout propaganda . 
  austerity did work for its intended goal of closing the -14 % greek deficit to a 1 % surplus , which is the most extreme fiscal adjustment in human history . 
  the problem is that the eu powers that be decided that this was not good enough , not a single word of respect to people who have suffered through this fiscal adjustment but instead propaganda . 
  if you look at tsipras proposal what he pledges is basically `` austerity-lite '' but the eu powers think that greece should continue through the harshest form of austerity with no end goal and no hope . 
  i am hoping for a landslide no vote this sunday , the fiscal adjustment which is the most brutal aspect of a currency change has already taken place in greece , now it is time for greece to stand on its own 2 feet without a bunch of unelected bearucrats in brussels trying to stage a coup in athens every few years . 
   well in that sense because they like spending other peoples money what are you talking about ? 
  syriza has received no money from outside greece , ever and if a no vote wont for a very long time . 
  if there is a no vote , people are voting to accept the fact that things will get worse for a few years until the economy can stands on its own 2 feet . 
  the referendum is a win-win for them in the long-term . 
  if yes vote , many resign and new government implements austerity which brings country further into crisis and return of syriza in 3-4 years if no vote . 
  syriza cements their power for a decade or more if no referendum that would be a lose-lose, 
  cuidadanos is a controlled opposition party meant to siphon off some of the centrist podemos voters . 
  . just like to potami in greece which was invented just before the elections recently . 
  this sounds like they are preparing for something coming soon , not sure if for podemos or catalan , maybe both or something else we do n't know yet . 
  the loophole is that geo-politics is more important than a tiny economy like greece , the powers that be do n't care if greece prints drachmas , they do care if greece exits the eu since that way leads only to russia . 
  `` atm 's now require human sacrifice , vote yes ! '', 
  to potami is new democracy/pasok 2.0 , the leader visited brussels for a day and then came back saying how tsipras should be removed from government . 
  just more puppets that nobody cares about any more . 
  there is no written document in any eu institution that says if a country leaves the euro it must leave the eu . 
  firstly , the only legal way to exit the eu is from a brexit style option . 
  secondly , you are completely and utterly clueless about geo-politics and world affairs if you think eu would ever let greece go . 
  the two need each other and vice versa for various reasons , none of them purely economic . 
  greece is n't leaving the eu either way , not sure if you realize what the current vote is for . 
  there already is or working on it for both countries actually , but that is unrelated to current crisis . 
  greece was spending 10 % of gdp on military for almost 20 years , up until the mid 90 's . 
  it is primarily military spending that caused this crisis . 
  greece most recent default , today is due to the fact greece spent over 500-600 billion euros on military after the cyprus invasion . 
  almost every default in greek history if not all are due to military spending and i assume germany 's defaults are all due to military spending also . 
  reported to sultan erdogan, 
  that is like saying you can neglect greece history of defaults since most of them are due to military conflicts and military spending considering greece was in 6 major wars in the last 200 years . 
  greece was involved in 6 major wars and 3-4 minor conflicts in the last 200 years also which led to most of these defaults . 
  the cyprus conflict led to 400-600 billion euros of military spending which caused current crisis . 
  the `` plan b '' syriza is talking about is not communism , but most likely joining brics bank as the 6th member . 
  putin invited tsipras to join brics last month and he also ordered the referendum to take place 24 hours before the opening ceremony of brics , which most likely is not a coincidence and most likely this `` plan b '' syriza has been referring to the last few months . 
  greece fought a brutal civil war to defeat communism . 
  where 1 million people died . 
  you are a complete fucking idiot to think communism will come to greece . 
  the actual communism party of greece , kke which openly supports real communism gets around 3 % of the votes the same as the nazi party . 
  the economic policy tsipras handed in to imf/eu last week which was rejected is complete far-right economic policy . 
  a real communist would never have handed in such a proposal . 
  this report is less propaganda than any of european media, 
  you realize greece has survived 10000x worse just in the last century correct ? 
  your country had it easy while greece lost 2 million people ( 20 % ) to ww2 and the civil war , do n't talk about `` survival '' . 
  most countries on earth would have been in brutal civil war under the economic conditions greece has been over the last few years , 30 % unemployment , 60 % for youth , millions in poverty , etc. 
  it is already worse than the 1920 's american great depression in numbers . 
  yet crime has gone down and greece is ranked the 18th safest place on earth according to oecd in recent rankings . 
  going to the drachma wo n't cause riots because it is what the people chose , people do n't riot and become anarchists from a choice they made and feel will work out in the long-term . 
  brics is for investment projects not loans, 
  it is more complicated than that , greece not only is capable of paying all the debt back but has been trying to negotiate a deal to do such . 
  the issue is this , the creditors want greece to pay back the debt while under-taking more austerity and more unemployment when they are already in a state worse than 1920s american great depression , far worse actually if you look at the real numbers . 
  i personally though eu/imf would realize that greeks have crossed the line of `` i dont give a fuck any more '' and try to make a deal which loosens up some of the austerity ( not all ofcourse ) and agree to a deal which tsipras has proposed that is basically `` austerity-lite '' . 
  the question is not that greeks do not want to pay the debt back , ofcourse that is the best option . 
  . but not while the demand is to continue this raging great depression which is destroying society . 
  is it not possible to find a middle ground ? 
  apparently not , since this has now become something more than `` debt and economy '' , i am not even sure what it is any more , but it is leading greece to a grexit because if there is a choice between continuing the great depression for another decade or exit and try to stand on your own 2 feet , the answer is very very simple . 
   greece depends on the good will of the imf and europe , especially after a default . 
  this is debatable , we will soon seen i suppose  [ `` the prime minister \\ ( tsipras \\ ) thanked storchak and said he was pleasantly surprised by the invitation for greece to be the sixth member of the brics development bank . 
  ] ( http://rt.com/business/257701-greece-russia-brics-invitation/ ) tsipras said greece is interested in the offer , and promised to thoroughly examine it . 
  he will have a chance to discuss the invitation with the other brics leaders during the 2015 international economic forum in st. petersburg , '' the statement said . 
  [ during the st. petersburg conference which tsipras attended he made this very cryptic speech ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrgugqwhifk ) [ tsipras has planned the referendum 24 hours before the brics development bank has their official opening ceremony ] ( http://thebricspost.com/brics-bank-to-commence-business-on-7-july/ ), 
  they would n't be official euros though and would be banned from international trade most likely . 
  i know what i said was rude and uncalled for but it is just reality and germans are so incredibly propagandized against greece from their media i find it funny they can not learn from their own history to at least understand the current difficulties of greece . 
  like tsipras said , there is only so much a country can endure when it is being humiliated on a daily basis , germany reacted one way from this humiliation and greece is acting a certain way also . 
  it is plausible because greece had the lowest suicide rate on earth prior to the crisis or one of the lowest ( definitely lowest 5 ) , so a minor increase would already be 200-300 % increase in suicides . 
  yes syriza caused this entire crisis . 
  not new democracy and pasok stacking up hundreds of billions in debt for their oligarch and elite friends over the last 30 years . 
  everybody in greece knows what caused this current crisis and it is n't syriza .

  spanish government seems to be well aware of the potential risks and preparing ahead for that eventuality . 
  i am a social libertarian . 
  i disagree with the law . 
  it is also completely irrelevant to the economy which is what you claim would cause the riots . 
  are you sure you are replying to the right guy mate ? 
   now i ask you : how would you have improven greece 's situation ? 
  i would followed the imf program . 
   greece is not and has not at any point been comparable to spain , portugal and especially ireland . 
  i will ignore ireland because i kind of agree there . 
  but spain and portugal are very much comparable to greece . 
  both have long term economic problems , government corruption , problems collecting taxes and high debts . 
  incidentally , they are both same climate , roughly same industries ( tourism , agriculture etc ) and same political culture ( dictatorships roughly 40 years ago followed by democracy ) . 
  i honestly ca n't think of countries that could make better comparisons . 
  can you tell me a single reason why they are n't comparable besides `` they just are n't '' ? 
   it was certainly getting there . 
  according to whom ? 
  for what reason ? 
  what indicators show that greece would have almost civil war and declare martial law for the first time in 50 years ? 
   given a few more months to a year , and that 's what would be happening . 
  no , in my opinion , since it is ridiculous unsubstantiated assertions time , the zog would finally put up with our pitiful existence and come blast all of greece out of the stratosphere as revenge for us electing nd . 
   let 's not forget that economy would n't actually get any better with them in power , and they too would have to impose further cuts that are being asked of syriza now . 
  much like it did n't for [ spain ] ( http://www.thespanisheconomy.com/portal/site/tse/menuitem.efbc5feeac2b3957b88f9b10026041a0/?vgnextoid=b1fd7e7b61b7f310vgnvcm1000002006140arcrd ) , [ portugal ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/eu/countries/portugal_en.htm ) or [ ireland ] ( http://www.cso.ie/indicators/maintable.aspx ) ? 
  yeah , i totally see that . 
   now tell me , what do people do when every third or soon to be second person has no income and no way to get any ? 
  do they sit at home and post on reddit ? 
  i do n't know , we 'll find out when syriza is done fucking up this country . 
   so yes , your city would very much be on fire at this point . 
  unless nd did the exact same things that syriza is doing , which they probably would have been forced to do anyway unless they 're outright insane . 
  [ sure thing boss ] ( https://i.warosu.org/data/tg/img/0277/77/1381962181773.jpg ), 
  oh yeah , just like the city was on fire before when nd was in power and we also had martial law before . 
  you forgot to add the nazi space aliens that would invade again if nd was re-elected . 
   it worked out significantly better than the alternative in the last elections . 
  what with us going bankrupt with the last government , banks not opening , wages up in the air and so the pensions . 
  thank god this government brought stability back and started fixing things . 
  i think varoufakis insists on what , in theory , should happen and forgets what is actually happening . 
  which is ... exactly what i said ? 
  the coe is not the eu . 
  you just have no clue what yer talking about . 
  whatever you say . 
  it is still fucking none of the coe 's bussiness . 
  if india or zimbabwe or the north american union commented on how the referendum was invalid , the proper response is `` fuck off , it 's none of your fucking bussiness '' . 
  this is a national matter of the highest importance and while we would all love to have a couple of months to talk it out , we do n't . 
  do we owe the council of europe money ? 
  they can fuck off , none of their bussiness . 
  that 's silly and irrelevant . 
  everyone knows what the questions mean . 
  no means `` fuck you europe and merkel '' . 
  yes mean `` maybe we can talk it out bby , pls '' the short period does n't matter that much either . 
  people have an opinion 5 years now on the whole thing . 
  once the smoke cleared up on what we would be voting on exactly the next day , people are ready . 
  as for coe ... none of their bussiness . 
  we er ... fully agree . 
  i am not being ironic . 
  i genuinely think kapodistrias was a fantastic politician . 
  it 's a joke . 
  i am sure people will understand  but yeah , especially kapodistrias and venizelos are shining examples of competent and good statesmen in my opinion . 
  as / u/gorat said : with [ kapodistria ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ioannis_kapodistrias ) we went bankrupt and we put him in our coins . 
  with [ trikoupis ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/charilaos_trikoupis ) we went bankrupt and he has a highway named after him . 
  with [ venizelos ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eleftherios_venizelos ) we went bankrupt and we named the god damn central airport after him . 
  we are probably naming the first greek space base after tsipras . 
  pls no bully i poor kid from ~ ~ brazi ~ ~ grease huehue, 
  i am financially secured as long as us dollars are worth anything , thanks for your concern . 
  just wan na point out the level of discourse in this country when you people literally say we vote * for killing children and unemployed * . 
  i am not sure if i should consider it hilarious or depressing . 
   i dont want any comparison with people that are actually are murdering their kids , unemployed people we also eat babies . 
  in fact , baby flambe is our specialty . 
   austerity measures such as the ones imposed on greece have not been imposed on the other countries , did you consider that ? 
  no , because it is n't true . 
  spain and portugal have both gotten pretty much the same demands as greece . 
  they simply implemented them much more efficiently and with less turmoil and push back . 
  now that the measures worked and their debt is back under control * of course they have it lighter than us * . 
  that 's the point of all of this !, 
   furthermore , i think it is more civil to keep all comments in english . 
  i have german friends myself , leftist ones ( yes , it is an actual thing ) and i discuss with them daily . 
  sure . 
  i insist that germans are n't out there to make the 4th reich . 
  i dislike the eu a lot but the blood is on our hands in this situation . 
   have you not seen the actual numbers i have . 
  perhaps you should too . 
  in 2014 , all southern eu countries were still in recession but it was quickly evening out . 
  today ( and i use spain as an example here because they are the most similar to us in terms of economy ) it has reversed and those countries are starting to recover . 
  [ here ] ( http://www.thespanisheconomy.com/portal/site/tse/menuitem.efbc5feeac2b3957b88f9b10026041a0/?vgnextoid=b1fd7e7b61b7f310vgnvcm1000002006140arcrd ) are more details if you want to check for yourself . 
  samaras did well . 
  greece was on the road to recovery and would be fine much like spain and portugal right now . 
  if `` corrupt '' samaras stayed in power , today we would n't be declaring bankruptsy . 
  oh , lol , no problem . 
  my father lives near ksilokastro . 
  small village . 
  he bought the house + fields with the money the greek army ( he was an officer ) withhold from your pay every month to give it as a lump sum at the end + savings he had gathered for that purpose . 
  he also essentially built the house himself with minimum cost over a decade . 
  both parties specifically avoided framing the question like that . 
  syriza did n't promise to tear apart the agreement but to fundamentally change it into a `` growth '' plan . 
  yes , it was moronic but the average person ate it up . 
  i am not this sub . 
  my respect for far leftists never existed in the first place . 
  the fact that you brought my country down does n't exactly generate much respect either . 
   i do n't even know why i 'm writing this . 
  you 'll probably say i 'm an idiot or something . 
  nah , you already stated that yourself . 
  read the full post  i am currently in canada and do well for myself .

  secondly you do n't have any arguements , germany is morally bankrupt . 
  i never personally attacked you , i pointed out the hypocrisy in your actions , just like alleguet ( who has owned you repeatedly ) did before . 
  you still have n't even responded to that . 
  funny to see you go back to full confident-know-it-all keyboard warrior once you think you 're winning . 
  we would n't mind 1492 , the despotate of the morea , the duchy of athens and the empire of trebizond were still around :d, 
  make them pay ? 
  it seems to me more like without the uk the eu is nothing . 
  angela merkel has no power over eu foreign policy , unless you claim that the eu is germany 's iv reich or something . 
  why would they pay ? 
  they are a sovereign state and they can manage their own affairs . 
  without this joke of a union they 're still a unsc permanent member and a major world power . 
  germany on the other hand ... 
  the very fact that they breach eu law is illegal , you do n't need further proof of corruption . 
  besides , why would they harbour a wanted criminal , if they were n't corrupt ? 
  it 's not like christoforakos is a german , he 's a greek national , wanted by the greek authorities for very real and internationally accepted crimes . 
  did he also ban vw cars ? 
  sorry , had to do it . 
  you guys are the master removers . 
  maybe we should time travel and fetch some of you to constantinople in 1453 . 
  where else will you get your daily dose of reasons to lose faith in humanity ? 
  european humanism in action : if all else fails , blame the weakest guy in the room . 
  renzi and hollande are socialists ? 
  in what universe ? 
  why did the americans even forgive you guys ? 
  they should have let the soviets reach the rhine and wreck havock to everything east of it . 
  it seems that neither the allies ' kindness after wwii nor their severity in versailles taught you lot anything . 
  no wonder frederick the great loved his dogs more than people , if this is the sort of people that surrounded him . 
  funny how the us rebuilt germany and wiped away their debts and forced small countries like ours , to which they owed billions , to not demand their owed reparations . 
  instead of giving us a hand since we had to borrow billions to rebuild our nation , they slam their foot on our face and say that `` debts must be paid '' . 
  yeah , says the country that never paid its debts to humanity for 2 world wars . 
  how could they have learned their lesson when instead of being punished for wwii they got american protection and free cash to turn their country into a paradise ? 
  we should have listened to the british and leveled their entire industry and let them be occupied by the french , maybe then they 'd show an ounce of fucking human decency and compassion . 
  `` pay your debts '' well , yeah maybe if they had n't destroyed 99 % of our infrastructure , stolen all our immense gold reserves ( which they still have btw ) and not murdered 1/10th of our population while plunging us into instability for decades , we would n't have needed debts to build roads and a semblance of a modern economy . 
  sometimes i think europe would be better under us rule . 
  the americans help the poorer states in their union by sending industries and jobs their way , they do n't milk them for money and treat them like second rate human beings and then claim to be saviours . 
  hopefully , but it 's becoming less believable by the day . 
  fine by me . 
  let 's do balkan war iii : the final removal of kebab, 
  being under someone 's rule is n't exactly the same as being able to decide for them . 
  not even all of venice is to blame , it 's affairs got decided by 2000 nobles . 
  just like not all of austria is to blame , the hre 's affairs were run by a certain number of inbred nobles . 
  then again the whole remove kebab thing is little more than a meme , so this convo is getting way too serious for that sort of thing , do n't you think ? 
  nafplio 's probably my favourite greek city :d, 
  verona , on the other hand , had nothing to with it . 
  so a guy working for a infamous german company that has been involved in countless scandals ( even being convicted by the us supreme court ) flees greek authorities searching for him for immense corruption scandals , directly linked a large part of the greek debt , flees to germany . 
  germany is supposed to extradite him as per eu treaties and it 's almost certain his testimony would shatter confidence in siemens and other german businesses ... the german constitutional court magically goes around eu laws and decides he does n't have to be extradited . 
  not suspicious at all !, 
  that just serves to prove that the german government benefits from greek corruption ... 
  right back at ya . 
  the same austrians who took part in the 4th crusade that let the kebab in , in the first place ? 
  they had it coming , if you ask me . 
  oh ok thnx for clearing it up . 
  italians removing kebab ? 
  serbia and greece just found a third member for their love triangle and armenia had an orgasm !, 
  bligh me , my bad . 
  from what i 've been told be people from serbia and croatia all former yugoslav countries ( except fyrom ) can understand eachother since they speak dialects of the same language . 
  i guess my comment only applies to serbo-croat then ? 
  such a majestic union full of the `` european ideals '' eu officials always blabber about !, 
  hopefully one day somebody shoves a big wall on their borders when they 're in need of help , then they 'll get a good dose of proper european humanism !, 
  continent of voltaire and augustine , my ass !, 
  not claim that you gave it to us , like that guy above did ? 
  that 's pretty standard for all military/law enforcement . 
  the vast majority of people did n't vote at all . 
  to quote wikipedia : `` turnout was exceptionally low at 56.6 % , the lowest ever recorded in a greek legislative election since the restoration of democracy in 1974 . '', 
  30 % of 43.4 % voted for tsipras . 
  and most just did to avoid nd getting back in power . 
  supposedly in four years , if you ask me , probably in may . 
  we have n't had a stable government in forever . 
  please annex them asap !, 
  the uk 's recognition of it as macedonia is against eu protocol , but nobody has taken the time to do anything about it . 
  we have slightly more pressing issues . 
  how we treat our neighbours ? 
  fyrom 's president admitted that we 're their cloest ally a week ago . 
  bulgaria has a treaty of friendship and cooperation with us . 
  albania has no right to talk about immigrants , the number of albanians in greece is equal to 1/5 of albania 's population . 
  and since we `` blame everyone else '' how are we to blame ? 
  for a refugee crisis started by british , german , american and french weapons in a far-away country that we have no way of stopping ? 
  you ex-yugo guys practically speak the same language ... even if you do n't want to admit it . 
  imf cheerleaders would be at 40 % ( not even really , most of them are just scared old people who believe the media , so it 's more like 25 % ) and neo-nazis are 7 % . 
  these monolithic commies are at around 3 % . 
  still , we 're pretty carpet-bombable , all we need to do is find some oil reserves and democracy shall be reintroduced to its country of origin , alla americana . 
  seeing how , according to statistics , most eu countries outside of greece see greeks in a bad light , i 'm not entirely sure they would really mind leaving us to rot . 
  they 're more concerned with their image getting harmed , than actually helping us . 
  i just hope that you 're right . 
  this thread was made for him xd, 
  sometimes i want to demolish any building built after the 1960s in athens and just rebuild all of suburbia . 
  especially suicidal people . 
  he classifies as more of an ass than an artist . 
  if crappy buildings are the way to becoming a major civilisation again , i guess . 
  to quote mikeius : `` at least we know who to send the anthrax-filled folder to . '', 
  `` fallen a bit far '' that 's a bit of an understatement xd, 
  wow ... 
  someone call that half of slovakia 'cause mussolini 's gon na sue them over copyright infringement !, 
  no offense mate , but i have no idea what you just said . 
  care to exlain it in broader terms ? 
  indeed , you guys are true brothers . 
  defaulting is something which any state can do and wipes away debts . 
  reverting to the drachma is not related to the debts , it 's a way to make greece 's market more enticing for investments and her products more competitive . 
  the referendum is an integral part of any democracy and it proved that we have no wish for your money . 
  greek shipping magnates control 1/5 of world trade and piraeus is the largest port in europe and the 2nd largest in the world .

  so yeah i know all about csto ( ie well enough to have made a diagram about it and the other post-soviet organisations ) but russia 's allies are n't limited to the csto any more than america 's allies are limited to nato . 
  i found it hilarious that you suggested i check about the csto on the internet , when one of the first pages you 'd find googling it has me as a significant contributor in this manner . 
   second you have a new government come in that is explicitly anti-russian and pro-nato come on what did you expect russia to do ? 
  as for what i `` expected '' russia to do , i expected it to do what it did ( same thing it had done with georgia , same thing it had done with moldova ) . 
  and that 's why i 'm telling you what i expect it to do with armenia when it becomes convenient for russia to do it with armenia . 
  secondly , do n't fall into russia 's propaganda that it did all that stuff once a ` pro-nato ' and `` anti-russian '' government came into being . 
  it had been threatening ukraine with dismemberment and invasion since at least 2013 ( when it still had the ` pro-russian ' government of yanukovich ) because of the eu association agreement , and because of how this conflicted with putin 's dreams of a eurasian economic union with ukraine as a member . 
  ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/22/ukraine-european-union-trade-russia ) russia threatened in 2013 that if ukraine signed that agreement russia would no longer `` guarantee '' ukraine 's existence as a state !!, 
  russia pretends that its actions were about nato rather than about the eu association agreement because the idea of its military invasion being a reaction to a supposed * military * threat sounds of course more acceptable than `` we dismembered ukraine because they wanted to be economically indepedent from us , and were making some trade deals with the eu that we did n't like '' . 
   so many wrong statements ... 
  mention one wrong statement . 
   armenia is ally of russian federation ukraine was ally of russian federation , even letting russia have military bases in its soil . 
  until it was n't and then those military bases were used against it . 
   but do have any idea about armenia ? 
  yes  armenia has no russian minority-important one do keep in mind that hitler also started with countries that had german minorities ( austria , czechoslovakia ) , but once he was finished with those he proceeded with other countries too . 
   they don \u00b4 t share borders and are huge allies - in term of both countries need each other if russia `` needs '' armenia , that just makes armernia 's relationship with russia even more dangerous , because the moment armenia may do something that displeases russia , it will be `` necessary '' for russia to intervene militarily to ensure that it stays an ally . 
  the only thing that potentially saves armenia is that it does n't have direct borders with russia -- but then again neither did moldova , and that did n't stop them from splitting off a chunk of moldova to keep their troops in )  on other side armenia is friendly christian ally on southern caucasus very helpful in their foreign policy in that region . 
  how can you even say something as stupid as rusia taking armenia \u00b4 s territory when you clearly have no idea about that country . 
  ukraine , georgia , moldova all were christian . 
  that did n't save them them from russia splitting them apart and occupying their territories ( crimea and donbass in ukraine , south ossetia and abkhazia in georgia , transnistria in moldova ) will it do the same with armenia ? 
  if it becomes convenient . 
  right now it has no need to . 
  but that 's the only thing saving armenia , not any unwillingness on russia 's part to violate the country 's independence . 
   russia had never interests in invading armenia and it never had interest in invading ukraine until it suddenly did . 
  and russia will similarly not invade armenia unless perhaps armenia chooses to apply for an eu association agreement , or attempts to do anything else russia does n't like . 
  then russia will say ( like it said for ukraine in 2013 ) that if armenia does that , russia will no longer guarantee armenia 's status as an independent country , ( and like it did for ukraine in 2014 ) will use the troops it has in armenia 's territory to grab pieces of armenia 's territory or perhaps conquer it outright . 
  i did n't say that nd broke away , i said that i 've seen various members of syriza and their allies at anel , complain about how nd supposedly broke away from its karamanlis-era past . 
  so * they * are saying a change happened , and * they * are saying it 's a bad thing . 
  as opposes to kostas karamanlis ( the 2nd ) who was loved and is still loved by syriza ( probably because he led greece to ruin , and syriza loves people who lead greece to ruin ) ? 
  you 're fallen to the greek establishment 's propaganda , where syriza are supposedly anti-corruption or anti-establishment , when of course syriza had already taken to it side the most pro-corruption parts of pasok and the most far-right pro-establishment parts of nd ( see the alliance of syriza with the far-right fascist kammenos ) . 
  syriza voted in as president pavlopoulos who was the right hand of kostas karamanlis ( the prime minister of nd who was mainly responsible for the greek bankruptcty ) and followed samaras 's tactics ( the nd prime minister after that ) of waxing eloquent against the eeeevil european moneylenders and pretending that everything bad in greece comes as as a result of the europeans , an we do n't need to actually change anything , it 's europe that needs change . 
  currently syriza keeps wailing about under its new `` neoliberal '' leader ( kyriakos mitsotakis ) nd has broken apart from the ( supposedly good ? ), 
  populist tactics of karamanlis and samaras . 
  even more evidence about how syriza and the old nd leadership were parts of the same establishment . 
  prior to 1979 there were 100,000 jews in iran . 
  now the official census indicates only 8,756 remaining there , so less than one tenth that number . 
  so many jews fleeing from iran does n't indicate that they felt their lives and families secure there . 
   israel is essentially an apartheid society with strong jewish political powers working towards the complete removal of muslims . 
  do keep however in mind that all anti-israel arab nations in the regions have already achieved the complete removal of all non-muslims , and certainly of all jewish people . 
  what 's the status of jewish people in iran or syria or indeed any other arab nation ? 
  yeah , they 've all been all * already * evicted from the regions under the arabs control , so it 's hypocritical of them to condemn the jewish people 's attempt to displace arabs without first condemning their own nations ' own actions . 
   but if you condemn the actions of hamas , you have to condemn the actions of israel as well . 
  i condemn the actions of israel in the west bank , but hamas is far far worse than israel . 
  israel wants to effectively conquer west bank , but hamas wants to conquer both west bank and israel and push every non-muslim back to europe ( at the very best , more likely just murder them all ) . 
  the tyranny of israel over gaza and west bank serves to hide the fact that hamas is another wannabe islamic state that would be murdering palestinian too if jewish people were n't around . 
  hamas does n't believe in a democratic palestinian nation , it believes in an islamic nation of which ` palestine ' is just a region in it . 
   and how are we going to prove migrants who landed in greece came from turkey ? 
  see a map . 
  it 's not as if there 's many different countries at the opposite shore , it 's just turkey . 
   so we should legalize pedophilia ? 
  the only argument of yours i opposed was `` would you ever want your 14 year old daughter to have sex with a 30 year old man ? '' . 
  that 's a bad argument , so bad that it 's barely an argument at all . 
  if you think that 's the * only * possible argument against the legalization of pedophilia , then do you believe that pedophilia should be legalized in the case of orphans ( as they do n't have parents ) ? 
  now that we 're done with the rhetorical nonsense , i am actually undecided whether at young ages it should be legal only within an seemingly ` appropriate ' age group or not . 
  i 've not read studies about the harmfulness of age-discrepant sexual relationships . 
  i personally suspect them to be unhealthy , but as i 've indicated already many unhealthy things become even more dangerous when banned . 
  i personally suspect 18-to-30 relationships to also be unhealthy , as i said , and frankly if i was dictator of the universe i 'd be more likely to ban them than to ban the relationships between 15-year-olds and 14-year olds . 
  i was n't completely joking when i spoke about enforcing the `` half plus seven '' rule rather than an age of consent . 
   but would you ever want your 14 year old daughter to have sex with a 30 year old man ? 
  but if the age of consent is 18 , i could just as easily ask would i ever i want my 18 year old daughter to have sex with a 60 year old man ? 
  perhaps you would like to force the `` half plus seven '' rule instead , regardless of age ? 
  in that case it 'd also be illegal for 35-year old women to have sex with 60 year old men . 
  ( again i 'd not ever want my hypothetical 35-year old daughter to have sex with a 60-year old man ) making it something forbidden is n't necessarily the best way of stopping it . 
  for example , if it 's * illegal * for 15-year old to have sex with 20-year old , that wo n't necessarily prevent it either -- instead it can become a ` forbidden ' romantic relationship or whatever , which ca n't be discussed with friends or family . 
  i 'm guessing a reaction of `` gross !, 
  he 's too old for you , what a pervert . '', 
  by her peers might work better to dissuade from such a relationship than if it must never be discussed with peers . 
   the other poster is implying russia is undemocratic for not returning crimea russia is undemocratic for punishing even * discussion * about the peaceful return of crimea . 
  this is a violation of free speech , a violation of the right to attempt to peacefully sway the opinions of the populace . 
  western democracies may usually not allow secession , but they usually also do n't punish talk of secession . 
   would a democratic ukraine allow crimea to secede ? 
  most democracies do n't actually allow portions of them to secede , with certain exceptions like uk ( see scotland referendum ) or canada ( see quebec referendum ) , which are especially progressive in this respect . 
  so unless you believe uk and canada to be the two only true democracies in the world , i do n't think you should be implying ukraine is non-democratic for not allowing the secession of its own regions . 
  if russia does n't return crimea to ukraine , then it should at least compensate crimea 's worth to it . 
  how much money is crimea worth ? 
   okay , first of all , the `` european council on foreign relations '' is not an official organ of the eu . 
  it 's a non-profit think tank that studies & observes european foreign policy . 
  if you can say that such a thing even exists . 
  their opinions do not reflect those of the eu i did n't say that it is an official organ of the eu , and i did n't say their opinions reflect the eu 's opinion . 
   i suppose you include germany and france amongst russia 's shadow-y puppets , too ? 
  no , the distinction between `` trojan horses '' like greece which obey russia completely against the interest of their own population , and capitalist opportunists like germany which shamefully undermine eu policy for their own benefit is quite clear . 
  greece had no interest in vetoing european involvement in georgia in 2007 , it was just serving russia 's interest when it did so . 
  greece had no interest in excusing russia 's actions in ukraine , the greek government was just serving russia 's interests in so doing . 
  the result is also clear : germany , france , etc , have kept their economies relatively healthy because they look after their own interests . 
  the economies of greece & cyprus collapsed , because they kept sabotaging their own national economies to benefit russian oligarchs . 
   second of all , nations do n't have friends , they have interests . 
  and sometimes government do n't pay attention to their nations ' interest , they pay attention to the interests of their puppetmasters in some other nation . 
   oh yes , greece imposed sanctions on russia the eu as a * whole * imposed sanctions on russia , greece fought against such sanctions , and it has claimed ( bragged ) that it prevented even harsher sanctions . 
  http://openeurope.org.uk/impact/greek-government-russia-sanctions-and-debt-relief/ `` greek government is against further eu sanctions on russia '' so , no it was n't `` greece '' that imposed sanctions on russia , greece took russia 's side against such sanctions . 
   greece has nothing to gain from an alliance with russia quite agreed . 
  i 'm not saying that the puppets of russia in greece want greece 's benefit when pursuing an alliance with russia . 
  the european council of foreign relations itself produced a study that declared greece to be a trojan horse of russia , even back in 2007 when the center-right government of kostas karamanlis was in charge ( http://www.ecfr.eu/publications/summary/a_power_audit_of_eu_russia_relations ) . 
  and that was * before * the very blatant russia-lovers of syriza took charge , the government whose foreign minister is a pal with alexander dugin , the government which blatantly sided with russia in its crimes in ukraine , the government which constantly bashes every western country as a loanshark and a blackmailer while never uttering the slightest word ever against russia or china . 
  when greece never does anything that displeases russia in the slightest , it 's probably more of a conspiracy theory to say that greece is not controlled by russia . 
  are they conspiring to give that impression for some other nefarious purpose ? 
  are they perhaps controlled by the cia to give the blatant impression that they 're actually controlled by russia ? 
   and one fuckup would destroy the local economy . 
  it 's the de-industrialization of the country , where every industry gets shut down because of supposed ` ecological concerns ' or by union pressure , that has destroyed the whole of the national economy . 
  but sure , suddenly you people give a damn about the economy or the environment . 
  it 's not as if syriza has consistently opposed every single damn industry and every single investment in the whole of the country .

  it did n't turn out good for them in the end . 
   you know that the orthodox asked the pope for help to deal with the muslim invasions , right ? 
  the intent of the crusades was to be a series of defensive battles against islamic aggression in the levant/anatolia regions of the orthodoxy . 
  this is true . 
  it was a byzantine emperor who came with the idea of the crusades . 
  was n't milosevic comparing himself to lazar of serbia ? 
  he was a socialist , but a nationalist too . 
  is that in cyprus ? 
   as opposed to the other religions that did n't use it ? 
  i did n't say that . 
   also , name a few examples . 
  they instigated many rebellions in greece to serve as a feint in their rivalry with the ottomans . 
  after the rebellions started , they always left the greek rebels at the `` mercy '' of the ottomans . 
  they were achieving their goals though , that is having someone to serve as a feint against the ottomans . 
   no , ethnicity was tied to their causes , it just so happend that the croat and serb ethnicity were of different religions , and the bosniak ethnicity was known as ` muslim ' in yugoslavia , thats why there is a mix up . 
  yes but religion played a role . 
  in tudjman 's speaches about croatian independence there were catholic priests next to him , similar story with milosevic but with orthodox priests , izetbegovic tied the bosniak war with his religious books . 
  all that in a country that was supposed to be very irreligious and officially atheist . 
   and of course you bash serbs and russians , would link the meme twice , but the point is just lost now i guess . 
  i did n't bash anyone . 
  historically , russians ( the russian empire to be more precise ) , used orthodoxy as a geopolitical tool to serve their interests . 
  from the speaches of milosevic and karadzic , all i understood is that religion played a part . 
  also the three finger salute etc. 
  anyway , during the yugoslav wars in the 90 's , all parties involved in the war : croats , serbs and bosniaks , tied religion to their cause . 
  true . 
  even though i do n't like orthodoxy , i think it 's pretty mild . 
  it was more mild compared to catholicism during the medieval . 
  there were also no kkk-y organizations tied to orthodoxy . 
  on the other hand , the russians use it as a geopolitical tool ( and also to give their citizens a post-communist identity ) , and serbs tied it with their war crimes in the 90 's . 
  in my opinion , orban does n't really want to take the russian side . 
  he 's just trying to provoke the eu in order to get what he wants . 
  i personally think that cappadocians were anatolian natives who were turkified but not islamized . 
  karamanlides can be considered anatolian too , since they descend from cappadocia . 
   i thought , you have only common language . 
  that 's the same with greece and cyprus . 
   same language , same culture , religion . . 
  religion does n't matter at all , fyrom and bulgaria are orthodox too but we do n't have relations with them . 
  i would say the same about the language but the greek language is only official in greece and cyprus . 
  well , it 's in italy after all . 
  can you speak greek ? 
  okay , sweden is both then, 
  greece is southern europe geographically . 
  just this . 
  and sweden is also just northern europe , not western . 
  that was a great burn . 
  greece is neither central nor eastern europe, 
  kingdom of candia !, 
  why is he an asshole ? 
  his observation is interesting . 
  the orthodox priests are suspiciously rich . 
  their church is leaking the shit out of romania for example . 
  no , i explained to you in another comment of mine but you brought up the kurds for some reason . 
   you all are made for each other  no . 
  besides he is the one who became kinda mad at my comment . 
  in every country locals hit on tourists in the summer . 
  of course on normal levels . 
  my point was that turks prefer european women and it 's obvious by personal experiences that tourists in turkey had . 
  google is your friend , you know . 
  just admit the truth instead of trying to accuse me of something that happens in your country . 
  i wonder what your `` comeback '' would be if i did n't have a flair . 
  swear words ? 
  you got ta be kidding me , i only pointed out that you 're talking bullshit . 
  you can also report me , 2 of the mods are greek . 
  that other guy in the link is a nationalist . 
  they 're probably obsessed with european women . 
  there are many stories about northern european women who were being hit on like crazy from turkish men while on vacation there . 
  turkish women are conservative on average and there 's this thing over there where dads and brothers are overprotective when it comes to the family 's daughters . 
  i do n't care if you agree with me . 
   communism : everyone should be the same they did n't mean it about homosexuals though, 
  i 'm surprised to read that . 
  i thought they would be one of the most anti-ceausescu voices in romania , if you consider what they went through during his regime . 
   i think the disputes in baltics are more about the specific regimes , not the ideologies . 
  but is n't communism kind of a taboo in the baltics ? 
  i ca n't really imagine a lithuanian/latvian/estonian communist party . 
  smyrna yes but not further . 
  i 'm thankfully not spending time with nationalists , all i know about nationalistic claims are from the internet . 
  they 're accurate though . 
  i 've never heard anyone claim it . 
  from the map , only constantinople seems correct . 
  at least that 's what some idiots on facebook say . 
  in the baltics both are hated equally . 
  why do you have to do this ? 
  the only impression people get from this comments is that someone is butthurt . 
  just ignore the post . 
  is that so hard ? 
  it 's shameful that greek dumbasses are involved in this . 
  those idiots should look at their own country first . 
  my guess is that they think that western european societies are religious , thus they want to be more accepted, 
   and kurds were n't that effective from day one either . 
  they were getting their ass kicked and crying for help from the western nations for quite a while . 
  you do realize that they 're getting helped against isis ? 
   then you deal with the government diplomatically , not by going around their back and doing these shaddy shit . 
   that 's very convenient . 
  helping kurds getting lands in northern syria where they are not even a majority is fine though right ? 
  providing small arms and training to anyone within the kurdish faction when it is known globally that there is a very good chance that it will be used against turkey is fine right ? 
  it has been proved that several suicide bombings done by tak ( or other pkk affiliates ) were syrian kurds but thats fine because they fight isis right ? 
  sdp literally has former pkk commanders in their ranks but they fight isis right ? 
  i hope you see where i am coming from . 
  you seem to be so sure that the help the kurds are getting is going to be turned against turkey eventually . 
  this is what erdogan probably says to move turkey away from nato .

golden dawn is a neonazi party , very very clearly . 
  you do n't seem to understand how responsibility works . 
  primacy of responsibility comes to the most immediate cause , then we can works backwards to find the historical reasons . 
  what caused the refugee crisis is primarily isis , so they 're * first * to blame . 
  what caused isis is primarily the iraq war , where america was the prime cause of it , so america is * second * to blame . 
  how many steps backwards would we have to go to find the time , nearly a century ago , after the 1st world war , when the ottoman empire was ` redrawn ' by the europeans , and thus some of the responsibility for the current crisis falls unto them ? 
  and by `` them '' we do n't mean the current europeans , but europeans a century past ? 
  so much for current europeans being to blame for the refugee crisis . 
  the fact they did n't object strongly enough to the iraq war gives them a much bigger share of the responsibility actually , than what some ancestors of theirs did a hundred years ago . 
  except that the eu did nothing wrong by offering the eu association agreement to ukraine , while america invaded iraq ( which was wrong ) . 
  treating voluntary unions like the eu and nato and voluntary agreements like the eu association agreement as being the same as military invasion and conquest , is what russia ( being a hitleric imperialist country ) does , because all russia ever sees is the ` spheres ' it allows to dominate and never respects the independence of other countries . 
   crimea voted to be part of russia it 's cute how crimea voted to secede in order to join a nation where secession is n't allowed . 
  so what is it ? 
  should secession be allowed if a region votes for it or not ? 
  because russian law very clearly says `` not '' , so can you russia-loving fuckers even pretend to not be hypocrites here ? 
   the donbass has always been full of russians and they were being subjugated , russia was perfectly fine having donbass and crimea be part in ukraine , when it could use ethnic russian votes to put its own puppets in control of all of ukraine , but when those votes were no longer * sufficient * to maintain control over all of ukraine , it went onto the stage of military invasion and annexation instead . 
  in short , fuck your fucking hypocrisy . 
  spoken like a true nazi pig . 
  whoever has the might to occupy a neighbouring nation has the right to occupy it , then ? 
  by the power of their occupation they prove to be the ubermenschen and the occupied nation is the untermenschen ? 
  and all honest democrats stand against vile nazi imperialist pigs like yourself and putin . 
   its russian troops defending the russian ethnic minority in ukraine . 
  just like hitler `` defended '' the german ethnic minority in czechoslovakia , ai n't that right ? 
  the problem that you nazis have is that western democrats have n't completely forgotten how adolf hitler started , and that those of us are honest and true to our ideas are n't so eager to surrender ukraine to putin , just as the west had shamefully surrendered czechoslovakia to hitler . 
  that you think the world should be divided in `` spheres '' and that russia owns a sphere of nations marks you as a vile fucking imperialist . 
  it 's ukraine and ukraine alone that has the right to decide with whom it is to make alliances , and no fucking hitleric imperialist like yourself has the right to tell us not to support ukraine in that right . 
   so you are denying the experience of my family being prosecuted by the soviet union ? 
  and nobody who was both * honest * and * sane * could possibly think i ever denied such . 
  i 'm therefore denying either your honesty or sanity , one of those two things . 
  and i 'm denying nothing else . 
  so you do n't want greece to move to a new currency by itself , and you do n't want the europeans to help financially support greece 's move to a new currency , and ( i assume ) you do n't want the europeans to just evict greece from the euro -- and yet at the same time you 're saying greece being in the euro is the source of its problems , and greece needs to have control of its money . 
  so what * exactly * do you want the europeans to do that would be fair to greece , according to you ? 
  you 're welcome , you troll . 
  the world is ( surprisingly ) larger than your family , and you should be informed about the many people who use the term ` reactionary ' without being communists or worshippers of the soviet union . 
  if your family does n't have personal experience of such people , then ( once again ! ), 
  surprise , the world is bigger than your family . 
  there even exist * self-proclaimed * reactionaries , if you did n't know that either . 
   from what i know this term is exclusively used by far left wing ideologues who worship the soviet union and communism in general no , it 's not . 
  as has been recently revealed , the europeans were quite willing to help greece move back to its own currency , if the greek government wanted to do so . 
  in fact the greek government bluffed with a threat to leave the euro , only to get a shrug and `` sure , we 'll even help you with that '' . 
  then it was the greek government that backed away from the plan . 
  so again : not the rest of the europeans who are to blame , if greece not controlling its own currency is the problem here . 
  the `` referendum '' , as you saw , did n't actually have anything to do with democracy , since the very government who announced it felt quite comfortable completely disregarding its results . 
  the referendum had nothing to do with democracy ( except perhaps as an attempt to destroy it ) and it was just a pr stunt which cost greece dozens of * billions * ( with a ` b ' ) . 
  in modern greek , delta '' \u03b4 '' is pronounced as `` th '' in `` this '' , while theta '' \u03b8 '' is pronounced as `` th '' in `` thin '' . 
  the `` d '' sound in english , in modern greek is written with the combination '' \u03bd\u03c4 '' . 
  i think that `` recognizing '' is shorthand for `` recognizing as legitimate '' which is if anything is a sign of maturity -- knowing that what * is * and what * should be * are two different things . 
  yes , that 's the rhetoric that the stooges of the kremlin use in order to blame the countries that defend against russia 's aggression for russia 's aggression . 
   ooooh i do n't know , privatizing in fire-sale prices and opaquely having russian firms ( state or otherwise ) win the bidding implying collusion ? 
  offering geopolitical and strategic incentives , such as use of ports ? 
  to be done : http://greece.greekreporter.com/2015/05/21/russian-railways-still-interested-in-acquiring-privatized-greek-companies/  openly stating that russia is in the right in the whole ukraine situation and condemning only ukrainian actions ? 
  close enough : http://www.syriza.gr/article/id/55098/statement-of-the-political-secretariat-of-syriza-on-the-issue-of-ukraine.html#.vb9it_mqpbc  explicitly endorsing russian social policies and diplomatic moves ? 
  hard to do themselves in regards to social policies about e.g. 
  gay people as syriza needs to pretend to be progressive . 
  what they can do is completely fail to criticize russia in regards to this . 
   well none of the above seem to me like the actions of someone in russia 's pocket , but the actions of someone that is trying to get any allies and/or leverage possible after falling out with the ez . 
  so can you give me a few examples of what exactly would have been the actions of someone in russia 's pocket ? 
  you 're confusing further sanctions with extension of existing sanctions . 
  look at the statement of the greek ministry regarding the sanctions , and how * hard * it fought to oppose further extensions , how desperately it tries to express that it fought hard to oppose further sanctions against russia , and that blocking such further sanctions ( and limiting the extension of the current sanctions ) was the very best it could do . 
  http://www.mfa.gr/en/current-affairs/top-story/initial-statement-of-foreign-minister-kotzias-to-foreign-and-greek-correspondents-following-the-eu-foreign-affairs-councils-extraordinary-meeting-on-ukraine-brussels-29-january-2015.html some quotes : `` the main thing we wanted to be removed , and for which we fought for two hours -- half of the time we were in the council was spent on this issue -- was the proposal for new sanctions . 
  this was certainly a difficult negotiation . '', 
  `` the phrase providing for the new sanctions on russia was removed . '', 
  `` in this sense , we called upon the present council not to move ahead to new sanctions against russia . '', 
  `` what is provided for is the extension of the sanctions that have been imposed in the past , which , however , rather than being extended to the end of the year , will be reconsidered in september . '', 
  `` it was also agreed for the council to explore and think about new lists . 
  this will probably be discussed at the council 's next meeting . 
  but these lists are subject to approval and ratification by each country , and we would not like to see the inclusion of persons we will not accept . '', 
  in all of this statement , frankly , you can see the desperate attempts of a pathetic servant to convince his russian masters , that yes , greece did not betray russia by agreeing to the extension , that it worked its hardest to stop even heavier sanctions , that in all the negotiations they still have the best interests of russia at heart . 
  and here 's how the greek threat of a veto was cancelled out by another country 's threat of a veto in the opposite direction : `` in this sense , we called upon the present council not to move ahead to new sanctions against russia . 
  i must mention to you that there was a country that moved to veto , but it was not greece , as the international press had expected . 
  this veto was put forward because a phrase was to be removed -- and we had debated for an hour and a half on this issue . 
  the greek delegation explained clearly that this phrase would be removed -- otherwise our work would not be able to move ahead . 
  this country was isolated and , in the end , creatively , agreed to a text that does not provide for heavy sanctions or new sanctions against russia . 
  what is provided for is the extension of the sanctions that have been imposed in the past , which , however , rather than being extended to the end of the year , will be reconsidered in september . '', 
   shit , the french are selling russia warships , are they traitors to the eu and in putin 's pocket for doing so ? 
  look at http://www.ecfr.eu/publications/summary/a_power_audit_of_eu_russia_relations countries like france , germany , italy , spain , are categorized as `` strategic partners - whose governments have built special bilateral relationships with russia , which has sometimes cut against the grain of common eu objectives in areas such as energy and the eu neighbourhood policy '' greece and cyprus was categorized under a new category altogether - `` trojan horses '' of russia . 
  and that was already in 2007 , not in 2015 with the much more blatantly russophilic syriza administration . 
  basically , it 's a different thing when a country does some things which are in russia 's interests when and only when it has a clear benefit to do so , and when a country does almost * everything * in russia 's interests . 
  france ( and germany and other countries ) have been capitalist opportunists . 
  greece has been something worse . 
   greece is staying in the good graces of europe , not putin . 
  greece is rightfully * despised * and seen with contempt by europe , as greece is wasting europe 's loaned money and insulting the europeans on top of that . 
  greece is liked by russia ( in the sense of greece being a loyal servant ) , as we 're always always voting in russia 's favor and always promoting russia 's interests to the best of greece 's abilities -- and they do n't even have to support greece in any way . 
   how the fuck do you logically explain to yourself that the wellbeing of greek people is being undermined in favour of the grace of putin . 
  since tsipras was happy to have the banks shut down and ruin whatever was left of the greek economy , just because such complete ruination of greece would be useful as a catalyst for the cause of `` sailing us to new harbours '' ( changing geopolitical orientation ) the logical reasoning is a bit obvious . 
   has syriza critisized belize yet ? 
  congrats for the intellectually dishonest argument that you yourself do n't believe in and which proves you to be spitworthy and contemptible . 
  it 's not with the embassy of belize that syriza keeps having its meetings , it 's not the capital of belize that syriza 's leaders keep on visiting to receive their instructions , it 's not the belizean institute for geopolitical studies that the whole leadership of syriza worked with , it 's not the chief fascist ideologue of beliza that syriza 's foreign minister invited for lectures , it 's not belize 's aggression against its neighbours that syriza supports , it 's not belize-connected oligarchs that are exploiting greece , it 's not belize-owned pipelines that syriza is giving permission to pass through greece , it 's not sanctions against belize that syriza opposed . 
  so fuck you , you vile rusophile pig !, 
  you may enjoy seeing greece ruled by stooges owned by kremlin ( why would n't you ? 
  ) , but honest greek patriots like myself are ashamed and furious that our government cares about staying in the good graces of putin more than it cares about either the greek people 's wellbeing or any universal ethical principle either . 
  fuck you again , you shameless asshole . 
  in my other comment i 've already answered it , plus asked clarifications about the distinction between `` direct '' and `` indirect '' . 
  are you having trouble finding me a single time where syriza has criticized russia on anything ? 
  hey , i 'm already waiting for people to find me a single time that syriza has criticized russia on * anything * , even once in its entire existence . 
  and by `` direct support '' you mean what , exactly ? 
  is voting against further sanctions on russia `` direct support '' or indirect ? 
  is putting all the blame on the west for the ukrainian crisis `` direct support '' on russia , or indirect one ? 
  is their voting in favour of the `` turkish stream '' construction , direct or indirect support ? 
  are all the votes in the european parliament where they vote against anything that criticizes russia , direct or indirect support ?

i kind of agree but disagree as well . 
  i agree on the front of `` federalising '' europe . 
  imo we need to realise that we 're all in this boat together and if we all accept that and all start rowing we can reach our goals faster , more efficiently and with greater success . 
  i do n't feel the need however for an introvert europe . 
  we live in the most prosperous and peaceful region in the world . 
  human rights are respected here more than anywhere else . 
  i feel that we need to step up and shape the vision of the whole world 's future . 
  a `` nationalist '' europe may be good for short term but for the long term it would exclude us from the discussion of future challenges . 
  and some piece of advice for people who want to try and bring `` tsiknopempti '' in their own country . 
  you need to choose a piece of meat that produces `` tsikna '' when grilled . 
  that characteristic smell of burned fat , as it drips on the hot charcoal . 
  a few choices are lamb ribs and some cuts of pork . 
  avoid beef , chicken and cuts with little or no fat . 
  another important ingredient is to share with passerbys , 
  [ some alchemy i did to provide you with the very interesting article ] ( http://docdro.id/6umepnl ), 
  which one of these is besides being beautiful , full of cinemas , restaurants from every major cuisine , shopping malls etc ? 
  imo thessaloniki is the goldilocks city in greece, 
  exactly !, 
  you 're right . 
  iirc that 's pretty much what my friend had told me . 
  the urban planner responsible for rebuilding thessaloniki was ernest h\u00e9brard . 
  however a friend ( who is into this stuff ) once told me that the plan was left incomplete . 
  if it was completed , thessaloniki would be much more beautiful . 
  but you 're right , salonica has a special place in anyone 's heart . 
  the food , the people , the view . 
  fellow europeans , pay a visit to our `` co-capital '' . 
  it will be worth your time !, 
  here in greece , the same as you . 
  though i 've heard the rather peculiar one `` if my grandma/aunt had wheels , she would be a scooter '', 
  i am pretty young , but i do n't remember seeing that behavior any time before . 
  interrupting another leader mid sentence to comment on his remarks ? 
  above all , that 's also extremely disrespectful . 
  i do n't believe there would be any real consequences though . 
  i think erdogan is smart as a fox in diplomatic matters and knows very well when he is in a position of greater power . 
  else he would know better than to disrespect the most powerful woman in the world, 
  ok italians , we get it . 
  your country is beautiful . 
   no mate , do n't be that guy . 
  it was literally ** the greek people as a whole ** who wanted the turkish soldiers free , ** not only ** '' liberals progressive citizens or academics '' well , i ca n't remember any syriza or anel members ( the two governing parties ) campaigning against the extradition of the servicemen . 
  it was mostly people from the political centre and liberals who gave publicity to the case ( most notably mr. doxiadis ) . 
   never happend , that came from a turkish source only . 
  the greek pm said that the soldiers would have a fair trial based on the european values , nothing more nothing less . 
  as i said in a previous comment , i do n't remember that claim being disputed by the greek authorities ( ministry of foreign affairs , or the pm 's office ), 
  that statement indeed came from turkish sources , but it was n't disputed at the time by greek authorities . 
  very important decision . 
  the pm of greece , just a few days after the attempted coup , had reassured president erdogan that those 8 eight servicemen would be extradited to turkey , in attempt to strengthen relations between the two countries . 
  however , many liberal and progressive citizens , writers , academics and politicians have argued that no matter the status of the bilateral relations , the greek and european rule of law can not be bent . 
  they argued that these people not only were they just soldiers on a search and rescue mission , without any knowledge of the coup but if they were extradited they would be tortured and would n't be given a fair trial . 
  the current government especially is of the idea that there are no illegal immigrants , everyone is a refugee fleeing from situations created by imperialism , capitalism etc. 
  so first of all they do n't want to crack down on these hubs , because it will create turmoil within the party . 
  previous governments , lacked the tools and the proper infrastructure ( as is with pretty much everything here ) and they also had to deal with the left ( which now is the ruling party ) which argued about everyone being victims of the neo-liberal , neo-imperialistic , neo-capitalistic , neo-eu , neo-whatever policies . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_paros_beating_and_rape check this out as well . 
  this case has had much coverage here in greece and everyone feels deep anger about that incident . 
  the girl still struggles with the rehabilitation process but her mother has recently given an interview admitting that myrto will never be the same . 
  i once read somewhere that there is an organization with pretty much global presence that promises the resurrection of dead people . 
  populism these days ... 
  not at all . 
  tsipras is a dubious character himself . 
  to sum it up for you in a few words . 
  tsipras and his party , along with the whole leftist side of the political spectrum have been expressing a series of arguments for many many years . 
  anti-open market , anti-nato , anti-eu , anti-euro whatever . 
  everything that has been common sense in every other european country , has been their ideological enemy . 
  but after they came to power ( after roaming around the 3-4 % for at least 20 years ) their history came and collided with reality . 
  their whole system of beliefs and arguments crumbled in a few months . 
  from `` the bail-out program is a policy imposed on the greek people by the loan sharks of the eu '' , to `` we signed a harsh deal , but if we had n't things would be unimaginably worse '' . 
  from `` there are no illegal immigrants . 
  everyone is a refugee and we 'll give them the necessary documents to travel to europe '' to people being buried under the snow in tents , or sleeping in the mud , because as a state you ca n't cope with that many people . 
  from the left traditionally being targeted and the newspapers of the left or even center being for many years almost out of law , to a government of the left targeting journalists , media and newspapers . 
  the past 2 years for this government have been damage control . 
  their whole history has collided with reality . 
  each and every one 's in the cabinet history . 
  in the previous weeks he has made claims that `` the borders of our heart reach from thessaloniki ( the birthplace of kemal ataturk ) to mossul '', 
  some rough translation added, 
  [ this ] ( http://www.novinite.com/articles/177589/erdogan%3a+turkey+will+dispute+all+stipulations+of+lausanne+treaty ) is another post about the matter which is now trending in greece . 
  at some point during his speech president erdogan said `` of course we appreciate all the successful stipulations of the lausanne treaty . 
  however it is not an indisputable , sacred text . 
  moving towards 2023 , we are aware that we will touch on many people 's interests . 
  still we will pursue that goal '', 
  i like it . 
  it gives me the vibe of europe 's leader . 
  that if there was someone ( a foreign leader ) who wanted to `` talk business '' with the eu , this is the man to talk to . 
  even though i do n't know any french and i do n't have any connection to france ( other than respect for their history , culture and gastronomy ) , i feel that this man represents me , my rights and my hopes as a european citizen . 
  and that something very powerful imo, 
  here is the view under the acropolis these days https://youtu.be/oaostrpg-zm?t=3m, 
  from the following answer he gave to the journalist ( which i did n't include ) i understood that he meant to talk it out basically . 
  the greek minister of education commented today during an interview :  `` these problems are solved from within . 
  meaning , a strong student 's movement able to protect the premises . 
  also , the academic and administration staff . 
  in that case we know that such phenomena do n't occur . 
  if some `` well-wishers '' want to present these incidents as if they were the norm then ... [ indiscernible ] '', 
  imagine however , that you had a common database for all agencies , that included the same information for every agency and branch of government . 
  then two people would have at least one difference , that being their social security number , or their id number , or their tax id number ( see , that 's three ! ) . 
  how far are we from that technology ? 
  will quantum computing enable such wonders ? 
  i disagree with the term `` debt crisis '' . 
  greece had a `` deficit crisis '' imo . 
  greece had of the highest , if not the highest ( relatively to its population ) public sector expenditure in eu , or even in the whole western world . 
  those structural problems have n't been fixed . 
  as for `` taking the hit '' , i would suggest implementing something similar to that in your personal life . 
  say , get by with a 10th or a 5th of your income .

  tell us in open that you 've decided for the next years that we should be bound to the debt and the troika . 
  there should n't be any kind of growth/development , there should n't be any kind of economic autonomy in this country . 
  say that it open . 
  it 's my opinion that all of this is a slow and painful death for the greek economy and that behavior is not becoming of europe . 
  that treatment has nothing to do with the europe we dreamed about during the 70 's and 80 's . 
  ** female presenter : ** and not only that nick , but the exact point you 're trying to make , the german paper s\u00fcddeutsche zeitung also makes . 
  they write today that germany is discussing about the hotels and vat while forgetting their historical responsibility towards europe . 
  ** male presenter : ** why do n't they increase the gambling vat ? 
  why do they refuse that equivalent the greek side is proposing ? 
  ** female presenter : ** they excepted the slot machines . 
  ** male presenter : ** is it because some of these countries have interests in the gambling sector in greece ? 
  also a question : what is the way that the citizens can intervene in europe anymore ? 
  do the elections play any role ? 
  does what the citizens decide during the elections play any role in this new europe ? 
  why do we bother electing governments ? 
  maybe start designating regional governors ? 
  something like this is what 's about to happen in this modern europe and it 's very depressing . 
  brother , those are the numbers that are employed in the greek state , not by the greek government . 
  it includes army personnel and regional government personnel both of which have their own separate budgets . 
  subtract 170k and you 'll reach the 300k actual public servants that everyone is talking about . 
   is this really about competition ? 
  i mean , there is a volume of demand , and they are part of the supply . 
  people are n't going suddenly to start eating olive based products . 
  however it might means prices will rise a bit . 
  tho since it 's food , the customers should be able to benefit from the lowered food-related vat so they 'll ( in practice ) loose little . 
  that 's not how it works - if i understood your meaning . 
  the distilleries buy at a fixed price regardless of where it came or how much it cost ( assuming ofc same quality ) . 
  the presses set their prices accordingly . 
  so a farmer in an island would sell his olives cheaper while costing him more . 
  would an increase in the island vat increase the price of olive oil and thus how much the olive farmers make ? 
  no , because we are competing against spain and italy , we are not competing among ourselves . 
  and even if there is a price increase , the mainland farmers will benefit * more * . 
   please remind me how much money they get from farming related subsidies ? 
  the average subsidy per acre was [ $ 39,53 across all greece ] ( http://www.emprosnet.gr/article/53651-nea-dedomena-stis-agrotikes-epidotiseis-2014 ) per annum . 
  those subsidies exist in order to guide a country to produce that thing and stop producing the other thing . 
  incentives . 
   if greece is kicked out , they loose all that too . 
  $ 1100/year in my pa 's case vs being able to plant whatever he pleases , benefiting exports from the weak new drachma ... plus if push comes to shove he still has farming land to grow his own food . 
  yeah , farmers do n't have * that * many qualms leaving the euro . 
  do n't forget the added inheritance tax . 
  it 's win-win i tell you . 
  too bad we 're relatively proficient swimmers and the waters in the aegean are not harsh . 
  i do n't know in a government level if that 's how they do it . 
  i would assume it should have been in this form : ----- ** paragraph 4 : pension reforms . 
  ** * original * effective from 31 october 2015 the authorities will phase in reforms ... * amended * effective from july 1 2015 the authorities will phase-in reforms ... ** paragraph 5 : public administration , justice and anti-corruption . 
  ** * original * the greek govt will impose harsher penal measures to tax evaders ... * amended * the greek govt will execute tax evaders ... and so on . 
  ------ btw , it 's clear an american hand put in the changes . 
  month , day , year ... we do n't roll like that here dude . 
  we 're not talking about inter-island consumption of the `` exported '' goods , as they are limited . 
  let me give you an example . 
  in x island there 's a large production of olives and olive oil . 
  it way outstrips local demand as most families make their own olive oil . 
  they sell their olives to the press , the press transports and sells it to a mainland refinery . 
  if they payed the same vat with the mainland olive growers , they would n't be able to compete . 
  plus what they `` export '' is pretty limited compared to what they `` import '' . 
  you 'll need to pay more for a toothpaste , a shampoo or an oven etc - things that are not produced there - compared to a main lander . 
  that 's why the existence of a lower vat is a necessity for islands . 
  well , if we drowned all the pensioners it would help set the budget . 
  now that i think about it , if we drowned the unemployed , the unemployment rate would tank as well . 
  plus all that drowning would create lots of jobs , reducing unemployment further . 
  priests , gravediggers , funeral homes would be needed in huge numbers . 
  and it would help with the low birth rate ( studies shown that baby making after wars / mass deaths etc ) skyrocket . 
  it would reboot the population . 
  it 's a perfectly viable solution , no wonder people did n't understand the satire . 
   so to put it simply , actually a grexit might be be good for europe you ca n't put it simply , and no , that 's not the case ( at least if you 're basing that assumption on the connection of grexit = stronger euro ) ** benefits of strong euro ** cheap money for governments . 
  lower cost for importers low inflation . 
  ** benefits of a weak euro ** increased exports . 
  benefits for multinational companies . 
  increased tourism . 
  foreign investment . 
  example : greece benefits from a strong euro . 
  they do n't export much and much of their imports come from outside eu . 
  we need constant loans ( well we borrow in euros , but since our imports/exports are tied to $ , the debt is in part tied in $ as well ) . 
  germany is the exact opposite . 
  they benefit from a weak euro . 
  -- though i would agree on the part that a grexit would be a bad thing for greece ... probably . 
   and ( iii ) eliminate discounts , including on islands  unpopular but definitely needed , i agree it 's not the issue of popularity . 
  it 's the issue of the islands being able to compete with mainland . 
  example : a farmer needs to pay 10-25c more per lt of gas in the islands compared to his peer on the mainland . 
  the island farmer also needs to pay more for the transportation of his goods . 
  the reduced vat helped maintain a level of competitiveness . 
  remove that and you remove any incentive people have to stay on the islands ( baring the obvious tourism industry ) . 
  and people say the greek govt are amateurs . 
  the others ca n't be bothered to fix the proposals to be in a semi readable form ffs . 
  they act like they 're teachers in middle school grading a test . 
  these are the people handling your billions . 
  i 'm in my thirties . 
  minced beef ( ~ 20 % fat ) + old bread ( no crumb ) + egg + onion + oregano + tad olive oil + salt/pepper + grind/stir = burger meat . 
  grill / bbq , may wash it with jd for flavor if grilled . 
  onions + balsamic vinegar + butter + tad of sugar + thyme + grill = prepared onions . 
  [ small loaf of village bread ] ( http://www.pontos-news.gr/files/psomi_152282704.jpg ) , circular incision on the top , empty the inside ( keep only the crumb ) . 
  bacon + pan + heat = prepared bacon . 
  put bread on bacon oils on pan after bacon is ready . 
  put prepared beef inside bacon infused bread + prepared bacon + tomato slices + cheddar + prepared onion + lettuce + heat ( grill/oven ) to melt cheddar . 
  bon appetit .

  if that were the case , at least some of them would disagree and there 'd be friction all the time .

  that 's why i 'm hoping for an increase of american and australian tourists this summer , who are ever so eager to spend their money , as opposed to our other traditional tourist groups who tend to be more frugal and spend most of their time inside all inclusive hotels . 
  not that i 'm complaining though . 
  it 's very easy to fall in love with the latter and in some cases you do n't have any other options . 
  wow when did all that happen ? 
  news reporting in greece really took a downturn !, 
  but anyway , just in case you are n't kidding : the whole '' united through hatred '' concept being muttered every once in a while here would never work and would never accomplish anything . 
  european states will never truly consolidate just because they encountered a common '' enemy '' , be it russians , turks , muslim radicals or illegal immigrants . 
  it 'd never be anything longstanding , honest or well-founded .

  of all the half-truths , things taken out of context , exaggerations and dramatizations i 've seen over the past 5 years , the whole issue of the german war reparations is the most fascinating to me . 
  it 's almost like some things only live on the internet , our television screens and syriza 's press office . 
  are they asking me to ignore reality and focus on what i read on an nbc/bild/ekathimerini article ? 
  sometimes it feels like it . 
  sure enough , i 'll hear people saying that only merkel is to blame , only schauble is to blame , the e.u. 
  is targeting greece , the imf wants to rule greece , draghi wants to obliterate greece etc etc. 
  however , ordinary people demanding the payment of war reparations is far more rare . 
  while the whole situation seems to be surreal to me , syriza 's campaign may be very , very real . 
  but are the greek people all that supportive of this one ? 
  not so sure about that . 
  some slovakian or some austrian guy browsing through this subreddit would think that the german war reparation is hot topic here and everyone 's riled up , but why is reality so differing from all these reports ? 
  ( this is mostly based on bittorrent , i do n't know much about streaming and kinox ) i agree with the point being made here , a service being taken down will usually result in a couple of copycats or very similar services , which makes the whole '' anti-piracy operation '' thing ineffective . 
  however we should keep another thing in mind , which i bet copyright holders and law enforcement are aware of and use it as an excuse to conduct such operations : * a bittorrent website like tpb is more than a public index of . torrent files * . 
  there is ( was ? ), 
  a large community , moderators and well-known uploaders who are somewhat organized and congregated in one place . 
  law enforcement aims to disrupt and dislocate exactly that , the community . 
  think of examples like demonoid . 
  what was the main complaint of users of the new demonoid when it came back up about a year ago ?

  and one way or another we will . 
  i would suggest though - if i may - to start seeing the amount of manipulation mr schaeuble and media have done . 
  not for our sake , that 's not something you should care about , but for your sake . 
  you might be surprised in the coming months or years . 
  the same to you too !, 
  it seems it did n't . 
  have n't you heard the news ? 
  but even if it did , it was n't out of solidarity or anything . 
  just a side effect . 
  i do n't suppose you see that it was supposed to be an effort with the help of our friends . 
  in any case we will deal with it rest assured . 
  there are many things we must think really hard . 
  but i would say that this goes for all parties . 
  well you forgot that part : `` at the same time , ** a grexit would be traumatic enough that it would help scare the rest of europe ** into giving up more sovereignty to a stronger banking and fiscal union , '' scary tactics is what will drive europe forward . 
  are you ok with it too ? 
  so in other words it was n't help , solidarity and all that crap . 
  great !, 
  and how about this : http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/30/business/dealbook/the-hard-line-on-greece.html?smid=tw-share&amp;_r=1, 
  how ? 
  well the narrative here is that many proposals for reforms were not allowed by the troika . 
  the only reforms we could make is what was on the agreements , anything else would be a unilateral action . 
  have considered the possibility that greece is used all these years for other reasons ? 
  that solving the problem was not really the target ?

  croatia is wonderful to have vacations there .

  yeah , i do realize that and personally i think it 's the latter . 
  i was wondering if the german public see it too . 
  but if he knows it doesnt work , then he knows it leads to bankruptcy . 
  in any case i was referring to his manipulation of the german public . 
  how can he tell them this now and all these years used their money for a sure ( according to his view ) failure . 
  does n't the german public find it an oxymoron ? 
  but doesnt that make him a liar to the german public ? 
  i mean if all these years he knew that the bail outs would n't work with out a debt cut ( which he thinks impossible ) then why did he push for them ? 
  why did he accept them and waste german people 's money on them . 
  he doesnt agree to a debt cut even though he acknowledges that without it any bail out program is doomed . 
  merkel seems to agree . 
  so why are there negotiations ? 
  why the `` deadlines '' ? 
  why all this charade ? 
  you think it is funny ? 
  you feel safe ? 
  hahahaha the joke 's on you !, 
  we will unleash this : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zof93ovta-u you are doomed !, 
  who knows where he comes from . 
  huh ? 
  they way things are going , pretty soon will be the absolute champions . 
  public spending will go to 0 !, 
  it was a damn great speech !, 
  well done and thank you mr verhofstadt !, 
  she 's a certified one !, 
  here she 's telling lady gaga that the end is near and that she should get out of greece . 
  by the way ... 
  if you dont like that gift , pandora has a surprise box for you !, 
  not very , but i know 2 guys with that name . 
  nope i am not '' . good at insulting people '' . 
  only those that do n't miss a chance to spread venom through lies . 
  i just despise hate mongers as yourself . 
  so in the end they lied to all of us . 
  to me when they imposed austerity and told me that this would make my economy better ( when they knew it would only make things worse ) to you when they told you , you were helping those nasty & lazy greeks . 
  when in fact they used your money to save private banks and not greece . 
  hint : being in europe doesnt make them creditors . 
  both of them are not members of the ez and have not contributed to the bailouts . 
  except for a liar , you are a complete moron are n't you ? 
  nah ecb did n't brake its own rules only for greece . 
  far from it ... look at that ( it doesnt has to do with greece ) : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xu5styaxyao this has to do with greece : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwud0mqu3qk both are very revealing documentaries . 
  they are german two . 
  you should watch them 1st chance you 'll have . 
  fair enough !, 
  here are a few pointers : http://www.welt.de/wirtschaft/article143576563/athens-nein-ist-auch-eine-niederlage-fuer-merkel.html http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/economics/11654639/imf-has-betrayed-its-mission-in-greece-captive-to-emu-creditors.html http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jul/02/imf-greece-needs-extra-50bn-euros?cmp=share_androidapp_copy_to_clipboard http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jun/30/greek-debt-troika-analysis-says-significant-concessions-still-needed http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/07/03/us-eurozone-greece-imf-iduskcn0pd20120150703 unfortunately atm i do n't have the time . 
  later on i will give you more on this . 
  so the facts are : you and i were lied that the former troika programs would solve the crisis even if they were followed to the t. also the options are two : - for greece to default ( nothing is needed to be done for this , no need for fake programs ) - for greece to not default : a program and a debt restructuring . 
  here are two very revealing documentaries : - one for portugal , spain and ireland https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xu5styaxyao - one for greece , https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwud0mqu3qk, 
  as i said the ecb is far from being transparent . 
  you can search it yourself and you 'll be surprized . 
  when it is not transparent then it 's easy to assume it is not neutral too . 
  in fact there are many things that point otherwise . 
   i do , i thought your english to be better and i thought you 'd read my comment correctly . 
  i said you pointed to the existence of a third way , not the third way itself . 
   yes and the mathematics do not point to the existence of a third way , whilst you and syriza keep insisting there is . 
  now you 're playing with words . 
  there is a third way . 
  it 's the one mathematics prove viable . 
  that it is not on the table yet is irrelevant . 
  the mathematical solutution exists even if it will never be applied . 
  so yes others with great knowledge found it and i can point to it . 
  my english might suck but i think you are wrong here . 
   [ citation needed ] oh c'mon ... it 's everywhere !, 
  almost on every report about the crisis . 
  even die welt had an article about it today . 
  google is your friend . 
  i am no syriza supporter myself . 
  i have to give it to them though . 
  before varoufakis no one even pointed it out . 
  everyone pretended it was otherwise . 
  the imf formaly acknowledged it . 
  personaly i cant control anything about the matter and it is certain that i 'll have to live with whatever decisions others will make . 
  it 's always good to know where these decisions will lead us and dont take their word on it . 
  the problem my friend is not the czech banks . 
  i have no doubt that the czech banks are very responsible .

  as i said in my previous comment as well , i was referring to the generalization  the amount of money earned in relation to the amount of money spent is an accurate indication for whether you are capable of managing your money or not . 
  not in the greek situation . 
  not when you can get cheap financing . 
  if the loans you get are cheaper than what you will get by the growth that a deficit would provide , then it 's to the country 's benefit to run a deficit . 
  sometimes it 's unavoidable . 
  prolonged periods of crisis , large works etc. 
  there were no comparison made . 
  my reply was to the quoted part . 
   he amount of money earned in relation to the amount of money spent is an accurate indication for whether you are capable of managing your money or not . 
  not the rest . 
  common people like generalizations . 
  on the contrary , data like this is very narrow both in terms of interpretation and , well , usefulness . 
  how can you define `` hard working '' ? 
  it 's pretty relative term , very broad and very dependent on social bias . 
  typical work conditions in china would make a chinese worker a very hard working person in germany . 
  on the other hand , a typical german worker would be considered lazy in china . 
  never mind the fact that hard working / lazy are actually character traits and not national traits . 
  what you can compare are absolute terms and not generalize them . 
  silly example : dutch people 's mean/average height is larger than the canadian mean/average . 
  does this mean that netherlands produce more nba players ? 
   the amount of money earned in relation to the amount of money spent is an accurate indication for whether you are capable of managing your money or not . 
  that 's wrong . 
  [ many times ] ( http://www.econdataus.com/primary-deficit-2011.html ) you spend more than you make as a country , even including interest payments . 
   if you earn less than $ 1.25 per day you are definitely poor . 
  in the central african republic that 's almost the average . 
  not saying that 's not poor though , but it 's still relative . 
  is there a problem with my language ? 
  you claimed that raising the ela is `` help '' . 
  i said it 's not . 
  and you follow it up with whether i noticed that the ela was frozen ? 
  i live in greece , of course i noticed the lack of liquidity . 
  or maybe , just maybe , the actual reason behind your post has nothing to do with what we 're talking about and you 're solely interested in bashing varoufakis . 
  in which case , make a new post . 
  there 's bound to be more people of the same mind as you . 
   you mentioned how about how austerity was making things bad in greece . 
  i 've stopped here . 
  you 're again doing the same thing . 
  again point me to somewhere i said anything of the kind . 
  or are you going to spam me again with wall of texts about how corrupt is the greek government etc etc ? 
   i could make the case that productivity is an indicatior of hard work , hours worked an indicator of how hard working one is you would be wrong . 
  when you have an automated factory that makes 100 stuff per day with 4 part-time employees and a factory with the same output but instead of automations , it has 100 full time employees , can you make any assumptions about who 's working harder ? 
  the first factory 's production would be through the roof . 
  does this mean the 4 part-time employees work * harder * because their output/hours worked is larger ? 
  or you have a person owning a small cafe . 
  he works there 16h per day chasing flies most of the day . 
  is he more hard working that a miner doing 4-6h shifts ? 
  or you have two exact same factories catering to local needs . 
  one is located in luxemburg , the other in zimbabwe . 
  are the luxemburg workers more hard working than the zimbabweans because their products are worth more in their respective markets ? 
  -----  and more importantly average pension how well a pensioner has it . 
  pension is fixed , you do not have to worked for it , therefore you can move anywhere in the world and enjoy a great lifestyle . 
  i do not care how you spin it , pension income is a good indicator , of ones quality of life . 
  again , wrong . 
  say you 're on a pension at $ 1000/month . 
  now you have two options , live in luxemburg or live in the philippines . 
  where would you be better off with that amount of money ? 
   i do not care how you spin it , pension income is a good indicator , of ones quality of life . 
  by itself , no , it is not . 
  and it 's not `` spinning '' . 
  without taking into account the actual purchasing power among other factors , it says ** nothing ** . 
  ecb froze the ela program because of the uncertainty factor . 
  since the road for a deal is being paved they restarted it , albeit of course a small piece at a time . 
  this will get larger as things get more stable . 
  keeping the ela frozen hurts the chances of stability . 
  so instead of going all out ( increasing the ela by the actual demand ) or not increasing it at all , they chose to do a first step that promotes stability . 
  it 's not `` help '' , they are not doing any favors . 
  it 's the ecb 's main function . 
  where exactly did i say '' ** end ** austerity '' ? 
  i like that you 're putting it in quotes as well ... go do your greek-bashing somewhere else . 
  well it 's a step on the right direction . 
  i hope the dust settles soon and people will return all their cash to their deposits . 
  $ 900m wo n't last long under a climate of fear . 
  31 pages , with a photo and a small paragraph of 3 lines to describe each custom on each page ... ** no thanks . 
  what stat are you basing your prediction on ? 
  :p -- but yeah , you 're right ... 
  yes . 
  we call them `` under extinction '' . 
  -- on a more serious note ( heh ) , when we had the drachma , as the americans call their $ 100 bills franklins , we called the 5000 note `` kolokotronis '' - the person depicted on the note . 
   why do you seem to take it for granted that other countries have to help you they do n't * have * to help us . 
  it 's in their interest to do so . 
  it 's in their interest to make provisions so this thing wo n't happen again as well . 
  let 's be realistic here : our partners do not want to forgo their loaned money and that 's perfectly fine . 
  but at this juncture they wo n't get their money back , they * ca n't * get their money back , without helping greece . 
  i am not claiming this is fine but it 's the way things stand . 
  either accept the loses and move on , or provide help in the hope that they 'll get - part or whole of - their investment back . 
  there is no middle ground . 
  no debt haircut . 
  x years of no payments . 
  tie debt repayments to growth after that till the economy reaches sustainable numbers - say a target of y % debt to gdp . 
  put in a clause for fiscal discipline : if greece gets above 2 % of deficit for more than 2 years running , then enact hash austerity to be put back on track . 
  after two years of balanced budget , relax austerity again . 
  make the greek irs to be an independent agency . 
  set expected targets of income based on professions . 
  audit people/businesses who declare less than said target . 
  make surprise audits to people/businesses in general . 
  promote the use of plastic money . 
  etc etc there are many solutions . 
  but said solutions do n't fit the current `` suggested '' european model . 
  come now with sch\u00e4uble 's proposal ... 
  think of it realistically .

  it was ordered by generalleutnant friedrich-wilhelm m\u00fcller , in retaliation for the support and involvement of the local population in the cretan resistance . 
  m\u00fcller , who earned the nickname `` the butcher of crete '' , was executed after the war for his part in the massacre . 
    furthermore , as most cretan partisans wore no uniforms or identifying insignia such as armbands or headbands , the germans felt free of all of the constraints implied by the hague conventions and killed both armed and unarmed civilians indiscriminately . 
  i did n't want to make it seem that they did not fight , there was french/yugoslav very brave fighters for years during occupation . 
  i am only talking about the pre-occupation fight . 
  yugoslav lasted 3 days in ww2 , greece lasted 330 days, 
  i find it sad that greece is not even mentioned italy had the order to take greece in 7-10 days as they had crushed the rest of the balkans in less than 3 days . 
  greece politely said no and fighting began which raged on for 300 days of intense guerilla warfare killing 150,000 axis forces and disabling 100,000 + more . 
  hitler then had to send in an entire german blitzkrieg division to take greece in 30 days of brutal warfare which delayed the invasion of the soviet union to late summer instead of early spring 1941 . 
  this caught the nazi 's in the winter and rest is history . 
  and yet the country with 330 days in fighting ( 2nd most was norway with 60 days ) , is never mentioned . 
  i will simply put it to the leaders of that time to decide this poll ** adolf hitler : ** `` for the sake of historical truth i must verify that only the greeks , of all the adversaries who confronted us , fought with bold courage and highest disregard of death . . '' ( from speech he delivered to reichstag on 4 may 1941 ) ** winston churchill : ** `` the word heroism i am afraid does not render the least of those acts of self-sacrifice of the greeks , which were the defining factor in the victorious outcome of the common struggle of the nations , during wwii , for the human freedom and dignity . 
  if it were not for the bravery of the greeks and their courage , the outcome of wwii would be undetermined . '', 
  ( paraphrased from one of his speeches to the british parliament on 24 april 1941 ) `` until now we used to say that the greeks fight like heroes . 
  now we shall say : the heroes fight like greeks . '', 
  ( from a speech he delivered from the bbc in the first days of the greco-italian war ) ** joseph vissarionovich tzougasvili stalin : ** `` i am sorry because i am getting old and i shall not live long to thank the greek people , whose resistance decided wwii . '', 
  ( from a speech of his broadcast by the moscow radio station on 31 january 1943 after the victory of stalingrad and the capitulation of marshal paulus ), 
  how peaceful of you, 
  under this law i believe you have a choice between paying in 100 installments or paying in one lump sum the entire amount due with a decent cut of total . 
  also this is for past taxes that have been avoided , not for current/new ones . 
  the logic is to push people to make a compromise between paying in one lump sum with no penalties or in 100 installments . 
  that list shows it in 4th place though, 
  turkics are asiatic people , greeks have no asian genetics if that is what you mean . 
  identity in greece the last thousand years was based on religion , so if a greek converted to islam ( and many did ) he would be called a turk . 
  there are many ethnic greeks living in thrace who are muslim and they are called turks not greeks . 
  so no , greeks are not christian turks , turks were and still are a culture based around islam and they did not convert to christianity which was the religion of peasants and 2nd class . 
  if you like any genetic studies i can link some but this entire thread is pretty idiotic to begin with . 
  edit : [ here is the turkic/asian genetics in population of europe ] ( http://i.imgur.com/yqigd5t.png ) [ and the dominant genetic in the population ] ( http://i.imgur.com/whbdybk.png ), 
  that is basically one of the cores of varoufakis `` decentralized europeanization '' plan [ read the entire plan here ] ( http://yanisvaroufakis.eu/2015/03/15/presenting-an-agenda-for-europe-at-ambrosetti-lake-como-14th-march-2015/ ) , it is a great read . 
  it is known, 
  i never said i was left-wing , i am not . 
  but you are free to participate like many others do, 
  lots of left-wing , pro-immigrant people post there . 
  there are tons of interesting debates over there . 
  the reason it is nice to have a place like that is that it is difficult to have an open debate here about certain issues . 
  not candy , [ but has to be this ] ( http://www.retrodb.gr/ark/sites/default/files/styles/watermarked/public/drakoulinia_f.jpg ), 
  i really do n't think it is a grab at political points , he is likely sending a message to his own party with doing things like this . 
  how can anyone in his own party demand any form of luxury when their leader takes cheap flights ? 
  if this is just a one time thing , then it is cheap but i guess we 'll see . 
  that seating space looks like a regular commercial airplane , not even first class . 
  i assume that is not a private jet right ? 
  i see , on the bright side the igb ( interconnector greece-bulgaria ) will be complete by 2018 . 
  bulgaria has already confirmed the purchase of 1 billion cubic meters of caspain sea gas will go through the tap pipeline in greece and connect with the igb . 
  which were the 3 ? 
  i am assuming south-stream and nabucco which has recently been replaced with the russia  greece pipeline . 
  but what is the 3rd ? 
  greece is not `` trolling '' - they want to start selling the vast amounts of produce ( fruits/veggies ) that greece has to offer and create tens of thousands of jobs, 
  poor relations, 
  the whole point of a prank is to hide your intentions until the `` reveal '' or act . 
  of course they would deny it until this new video was released in op and got 100 million views and huge publicity/etc . 
  that was from march 16 before this new video from op was released . 
  the big `` surprise '' of this video was showing that the croatian organizers/uploaders were part of this prank . 
  so it would be obvious that a few days ago they would deny varoufakis claim that it was doctored . 
  timeline : video uploaded after 2 years  week later v for varoufakis viral video  varoufakis says finger was doctored  video uploaders deny it  new video releasing showing they were in fact involved, 
  [ that response does n't prove much as you can see here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2ziawe/varoufakis_middlefinger_faked_by_the_same_german/cpjc3kd ) the main reason i will give varoufakis the benefit of the doubt is that he seemed legitimately confused when he saw the footage and said it was doctored . 
  that upload was done by the people who doctored it . 
  that is the entire point . 
  the talk was done in 2013 , video uploaded last month and the v for varoufakis music video came out a week later using that doctored upload . 
  now this video in op shows that both were part of the prank / u/retard _ capsule [ put it well in this post here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2ziawe/varoufakis_middlefinger_faked_by_the_same_german/cpj8xok ), 
  energy geo-politics is extremely relevant , i think many in eu are starting to figure that out . 
  [ this is the full pipeline ] ( http://i.imgur.com/5n0abn4.jpg ), 
  if you think greeks sit around blaming `` foreigners '' then you have never spoken to one in real life . 
  the blame is all on the previous governments . 
  syriza is a different matter and they are being very aggressive but that appears to be the strategy they are using for negotiations . 
  varoufakis ordered the attack of germany, 
  it was very nice of them to donate to a charity , but no need to make a huge drama out of it, 
   why are muslim women , black men , white working-class women not fast-tracked into teaching ? 
  these people all too often find themselves as teaching support staff , while people from less appropriate backgrounds and less genuine connections to the children are trusted to teach . 
  there are just 30 black male head teachers across britain 's 21,600 state schools and 127 black female heads . 
  it 's another example of the subtle but ubiquitous class privilege and institutionalised racism that pervades british society . 
  those evil british , jihad john has nothing to do with religion and that is racist to imply . 
  those damn racist brits causing all this trouble !, 
  i am not 100 % positive but i believe it was created as a way for fast communication in the european scientific laboratory , possibly cern back in the 70 's . 
  there was a need for instant communication between two computers so they invented the protocols that would come to be the base for the internet .

  it does not really matter how good your team is on any single day since everything goes in cycles , you might not be good now but in 3-4 years you might win world championship . 
  all that matters is a good sport culture and experienced coaches , preferably ex-players with experience . 
  greece national team has been on a downslide the last 3-4 years but this year there are some fresh stars in the team from nba . 
  antentonkoumpo , papanikolau , kufos , calathes . 
  lithuania has one of the best new stars of the nba , motejunas so the team will likely be built around him for next decade . 
  we shall have a basketball match to decide who stays, 
  the main cause of this is from ww2 reparations/forced-loan demands , which shifted public opinion . 
  i think tsipras could have waited a while longer before bringing it up . 
  he wo n't be getting replaced , at this point there is a higher chance of putin being replaced . 
  kind of , the troika has been split up ( through intense negotiations ) , into the `` institutions '' and the `` brussels group '' . 
  this makes one group the deal-makers ( institutions ) , and this is only done in brussels . 
  and the deal-enforcers/over-sight is the brussels group . 
  this has over-come one of the major if not the biggest obstacle between shauble/djisselbloem and varoufakis which was close to tearing apart relations . 
  the brussels group is at this very moment in athens in the hilton hotel for the next 10-15 days where they will be helping syriza finalize the reform list due by april 20th . 
  [ they are not `` first europeans '' but they do have the largest amount of `` first european '' genetics ] ( https://genographic.nationalgeographic.com/reference-populations/ ) southern countries like spain , portugal and greece have 30-40 % of these `` first european '' genetics , northern countries like danes and finns have 50-60 % . 
  by first europeans , they mean the original hunter-gatherers that arrived into the european continent around 35,000 years ago . 
  at this time europe was heavily populated by neanderthals . 
  there was what many believe to be a 10,000 years war between these hunter-gatherer humans and neanderthals leading to modern europeans having between 3-5 % neanderthal genetics also from inter-mixing . 
  the over-sight committee did not get thrown out , it has been re-named to `` brussels group '' and they are currently in athens for the next 10 days . 
  the problem is that a lot of these `` youths '' do not hate isis, 
  another interpretation of the pictures from my point of view is of a couple living a normal life in greece , that is what the goal of syriza is afterall , to bring back normalcy . 
  all of this controversy seems a bit much , not just this article but all the media going crazy over it . 
  i get the hypocrisy of the `` glamour '' photo session but i do n't think this compromises varoufakis pledge about the humanitarian crisis . 
   in short , while the ecb is doing its best within the parameters it has been given , its ` best ' is unlikely to be good enough .

  no money for insurance either , so you would n't wan na crash that thing and have to pay for the repair . 
  why not split the difference and put it in newcastle ? 
   capital : anywhere but fucking manchester . 
  liverpool it is . 
  where i live , my `` new friends '' would be bulgarians and romanians . 
  i like how op did n't even bother taking actual state borders into consideration . 
  yeah , but we lose northern greece . 
  not worth it . 
  messed up people , as you said . 
  these groups of fucknuts were doing these things even before the refugee crisis . 
  it 's just easier to find their targets now .

  what the fuck is wrong with turkey 's government ? 
  because paying employees and imports in euros is more expensive than paying them in korunas .

  too late for us for something alike . 
  great news for the czech republic if this ends up happening . 
  not bad at all . 
  i 'm just a bit of a joke-killer today . 
  sweden has a law protecting worker 's unions and allowing them to bargain their wages . 
  in a way , it 's a better than a minimum wage . 
  especially considering the average wage for a working individual in sweden which is significantly higher than most other countries of ~ ~ europe ~ ~ the world . 
  of course it 's bullshit . 
  as if britain went to war with germany to liberate poor poland !, 
  every country has always looked after its own interests above all , especially in times of war . 
  not the same thing at all . 
  crimea is a russian-majority region , so putin could at least pretend it was for the good of his people that it was annexed into russia ( which it was a part of until 1954 ) . 
  stirring up ( or maintaining ) conflict in eastern ukraine helps him keep the eyes of both ukraine and the international community away from crimea where the heavy conflict happens . 
  it also makes sense that putin would want to make sure that any current or future ukrainian government would n't oust the black sea fleet from the port of sevastopol ( which has always been a very important base for russia 's navy ) . 
  finally , although somewhat unlikely , a nato membership for ukraine was n't out of the question , but putin would n't let this pass and would vehemently try to keep ukraine under russia 's sphere of influence even if he had to force it under it . 
  the baltic states , on the other hand , have no russian majority , are already part of nato , and are of no considerable geopolitical significance to russia ( the country already has the ports of saint petersburg and kaliningrad on the baltic sea ) . 
  an invasion into any baltic state would be nothing sort of pointless and potentially catastrophic for russia . 
  china has a minimum wage ? 
  seems like fixing and modernising the city 's river port , train track system , and building more storehouses for trading products could greatly boost the region 's economy . 
  that 's not too much and there 's peace and stability for many years now . 
  as croatia 's overall economy keeps getting better , vukovar should follow suit . 
  just say former yugoslavia , because that 's what people mean 95 % of the time they say `` balkans '' . 
  especially when it comes to recent military conflicts and general hostility .

  i think gaelic ( both irish and scottish ) is a beautiful language through and through . 
  it 's just that the spelling is really weird . 
  those letter combinations , as you said , are baffling to try and decode . 
  many first-world , progressive , and economically advanced countries * really * do n't pull their weight when it comes to refugees and accept almost zero migrants every year . 
  we keep trashing ourselves in europe for being anti-immigrant and not dealing with the refugee crisis ( which - do n't get me wrong - i know we 're doing a very bad job at fixing it ) , but we 're still so much more welcoming and accepting in comparison to countries like south korea or japan . 
  `` he may rule until the day he dies ... but he dies tomorrow '' - trollmaster,

  your case * is * racism . 
  but this only applies to individual cases instead of in a society-wide scale . 
  and when it comes to its application , minorities have been systemically * way * more fucked by racial discrimination than majority populations . 
  you ca n't put both cases in the same basket and treat them as equal . 
  racism as a term means that you use your position as a part of the powerful majority to offend and/or oppress any racial and/or cultural minority . 
  sexism is the same only against a gender minority . 
  being a racist towards white people is a non-issue because nowhere in history were white people oppressed by non-white people in any society solely because of their colour or cultural heritage . 
  you can use the same [ source ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2015/oct/31/moscows-metro-stations-in-pictures ) as op did . 
  well , the flemish would blame the walloons for starters ... 
  the more powerful people stay in power , the more they risk feeling entitled to it . 
  we need a russian redditor uploading moscow 's and/or saint petersburg 's metro stations . 
  you should check out gaelic . 
  the spelling is largely consistent but the letter choices for sounds are atrocious . 
  what are you talking about ? 
  portuguese and dutch are very consistent . 
  not everything is `` pronounced as written '' , but all words follow strict rules in their pronunciation . 
  if a phoneme or phoneme combination is present in a word , it will be pronounced as dictated by phonological rules applying to all words with very few ( if any ) exceptions . 
  now tell me why english `` break '' does n't rhyme with `` bleak '' . 
  is it because of the * r * in the former ? 
  then why is it that `` streak '' * does * rhyme with `` bleak '' ? 
  there are hundreds of cases like these ones showing very little consistency in english 's spelling-to-pronunciation ratio . 
  this is also evident by english 's different accents and dialects keeping the same spelling across the board , whereas all other languages modify their spelling of words to mirror the change in pronunciation . 
  maybe you should have tried english . 
  yeah , i think our english-fluency level is worse than germany 's , but better than poland 's . 
  definitely a `` high '' level . 
  defense minister is also delusional . 
   0.5 % gdp growth [ welp .

  the term `` globalization '' really means `` immigrants '' . 
  this is what it is all about . 
  nobody is actually challenging capitalism and there are no serious anti-capitalist forces in the uk or elsewhere . 
  i mean , the world did not suddenly turn communist . 
  talking about `` globalism '' is merely a rebranding of the usual anti-immigrant rhetoric . 
  no , the point is that it is allegedly `` deceptive '' . 
  one has to have an iq less than the room temperature to be `` deceived '' by a perfectly clear english statement . 
  maybe you did n't bother reading the article . 
   more than half of germans see refugees and integration as germany 's biggest problem , a survey showed on friday , despite the number of ** newcomers ** falling significantly on the year . 
  and  arrivals have slowed this year , with the federal office for migration and refugees ( bamf ) saying on friday around 305,000 ** new ** asylum seekers were registered in its ` easy ' computer system in the first 11 months of 2016 yes , it is framed it a very deceptive way , but only if you do n't know what `` new '' or `` newcomers '' means . 
  it actually confused me even more . 
  does n't matter really . 
  they are not going to do what you want them to do , so you 'll end up perpetually complaining . 
  only if its a female cat . 
  if its a male cat you are committing sin in the eyes of god, 
   the best thing muslims can do ... protesting terrorism does not run contrary to that . 
  it 's not either one or the other . 
  so an demonstration against terrorism is `` pretending your religion is perfect '' and `` using violence to force others to pretend my religion is perfect '' you are off the rails, 
   they just need to stop denying it all the time . 
  they are protesting against terrorism . 
  that was the spirit of the protests . 
  i do n't think anyone denied something , it was more like you saw the `` terrorism has no religion '' placard and went on a rant . 
  and it was a very moderate placard too . 
  it 's not like someone wrote `` islam is 100 % perfect !! '' . 
   lol , ok mate . 
  this part here is where your trolling becomes obvious . 
  since you are not a troll , please explain how you complaining about a anti-terrorist protest helps promote `` living peacefully and getting along '' . 
  truth is i could grant every point you made and you 'd still be a wrong to complain . 
  it would be in everyone 's best interest to let them have their little anti-terrorism protest . 
  it 's not a big deal anyway . 
   i do n't want an admission of guilt , i just want the muslim community to realise that islam is not perfect and is causing many problems . 
  yeah that is totally not an admission of guilt . 
  it is an admission of partial guilt , or a partial admission of guilt . 
  you chose which one . 
  i mean do you really expect them to march with with banners saying `` we are part of the problem '' ? 
  you ca n't be that dense . 
   as i said , saying terrorists are not muslims is like saying the crusaders where not christians . 
  it 's dishonest . 
  no , the the goalpost alone . 
  you were talking about `` terrorism has no religion '' . 
   i 'm saying i do n't think it helps when they deny islam is part of the issue . 
  which is true . 
  as for your last statement , i have no idea what you are implying . 
  i want everyone to live peacefully and get along . 
  this was a protest against isis and terrorism . 
  and you managed to blame for something . 
  no , you do n't want everyone to get along . 
  at least be honest and admit it - the edl folks actually admit it so i respect them for their honesty . 
  but you are not even one of them and yet you lie , 
  china has a lot of people . 
  the taiping rebellion or civil war in the 19th century had from 20 to 100 million dead , during a time when the population was significantly smaller . 
  interestingly enough , that calamity killed a bigger % of people than mao , and it was started by a [ christian cult ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/taiping_heavenly_kingdom ) . 
  before you say `` so that makes it ok ? '', 
  no it does not make it ok , it just puts it into perspective . 
  and wear a fedora, 
   for the same reason we have plenty of people not interested in difficult but rewarding behaviour , we might see people converting to christianity christianity makes a lot of demands . 
  it is really not easy being a christian . 
  but i agree with the rest of your post . 
  do you even read your own sources ? 
   `` we were not able to register and control ** all ** the migrants that crossed the german border , '' but yeah , a million unverified people . 
  how many of them are verified ? 
  people are tired of experts man, 
   they 're only in deus ex yeah that is what the liberal media wants you to believe muslims are getting cybernetic implants and are threatening our biological way of life do you want another aug incident like the one in 2027 ? 
  not entirely , but he still has responsibility . 
  perception is reality . 
  if you scare people enough , they tend to view the world differently . 
   did he ? 
  brexit was achieved by the tories . 
  it was cameron 's fault . 
  well that is how politics works . 
  you take advantage of situations . 
  farage shoveled shit into the mouths of people for years . 
  it did n't make him popular , but a small group of ideologues listened to him , the ones who like that shit . 
  so he slowly established his base . 
  all he had to do was wait for an opportunity to arise . 
  the refugee crisis combined with brexit was the best opportunity he could hope for . 
  if he hand ' t shoveled all that shit , nobody would know him . 
  he would be a nobody and thus he could not have taken advantage of these situations as effectively . 
  it is actually quite smart . 
  i do admire him in a way . 
  just stick to your guns ( or your shit ) and one day you 'll get to use them , as long as you are ready . 
  alt-righters or the_donald members occasionally flood some topics . 
  they talk shit in order to get banned , on purpose , and then spend days crying about it while pretending to be victims of liberal oppression, 
  so what you are looking for is an admission of guilt . 
  that is very dishonest since you know that is not going to happen . 
  if you cared about social cohesion , you would at least ignore them . 
  but you ca n't even do that . 
  these people are telling you that they do n't believe islam supports terrorism , which is a very moderate message . 
  yet you shit on them nontheless . 
  let 's be real and admit that you do n't want the problem to be solved . 
  this situation greatly benefits you and whatever organization of `` concerned citizens '' you support . 
  you are allowed to apply for asylum even if you do n't have a visa, 
  we must be living in amazing times if the crisis of our generation does not affect society in a statistical sense . 
  by reading some of these comments you 'd think europe is in a civil war right now . 
  i see . 
  well i appreciate your honesty . 
  but i am not willing to cross the border to `` feminism is aids '' . 
  if you had a less angsty and unfunnily provocative nickname , i might attempt it . 
  it 's pretty sad that gold is needed to fight propaganda . 
  usually , posts like yours are in the middle or bottom of the page , drowned by hysteria .

  nobody is forcing anyone to do anything . 
  more eu integration can only be achieved willingly . 
  we may be one of the most eurosceptic countries , but greece is full of them . 
   something like 40 % of indians shit in the street still . . what works for a developing country might not work with a bunch of fully developed countries . 
  that 's why i specifically mentioned `` politically successful '' ; something that india * is * . 
   when india is as developed as europe , i could see it splitting up . 
  the uk is close to splitting up , and i imagine there 's a lot more chances in a country like india for there to be cultural , economic and social division . 
  i 'd argue that countries more often split up when in their lowest and weakest ( ussr , yugoslavia , etc ) . 
  see how the greatest threat to the eu came after the economic crisis , when multiple of its states weakened . 
  cultural and political division is still a primary reason , but , when there 's progress and prosperity , the threat of splitting up seems to be substantially lower ( usa , switzerland , etc ) . 
   depending on how the apartments are set inside , you could have one with a view of walls and people walking around in their underwear . 
  let me introduce you to [ this ] ( http://www.ikea.com/piaimages/0094492_pe232631_s5.jpg ) . 
  sea taketh and sea giveth back . 
  if india can be a successful federal state ( i mean * politically * successful ) , then so can the eu . 
  the differences between - say - an indian from arunachal pradesh and one from karnataka are at least as pronounced as the differences between germans and bulgarians ( if not more ) . 
  and that is on top of the country having over two times the population of the eu , more social and economic inequality , more cultural and religious diversity , more problems to solve and social issues to tackle , and an equally long and rich history . 
  if there comes a time when the people of the eu would want to fully unite under one country , they can definitely do it . 
  over 70 years of peace in the most war-torn continent ( at least within the eu countries ) . 
  that 's no small feat . 
  it 's also because universal health care is too `` socialist '' of a system . 
  multiple decades of red scare tactics have left americans very hostile towards anything remotely socialist . 
  tbf , no one is more enraged by the american healthcare system than americans themselves . 
  it 's good to remind them they have alternatives , even if they 're super hard to be achieved at this point . 
  it 's odd how an island with 97 % of its population being muslim coloured people gave so many of its votes to le pen . 
  if i had to guess , though , i 'd say it 's because of mayotte dealing with illegal immigration from nearby poorer countries . 
  oh , we gon ' bite it alright ... 
  should anyone care if they do n't ? 
  they corrected the placement of the words . 
  meanwhile , t_d is already saying macron has some ` splaining to do about his emails . 
  they do n't even care that they seem to be irrelevant . 
  that 's a very bland chamber of parliament . 
  * wielka grecja * is considerably wielkier than that . 
  so are ministers . 
  their rotten flesh does wonders when applied as a fertilizer . 
  names ending in * - ko * are usually feminine in japanese . 
  there 's also a comma after libert\u00e9 . 
  that 's not what an oxford comma is . 
  an [ oxford comma ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/serial_comma ) is placed before * and * or * or * . 
  the sign displays the french motto as it 's [ officially displayed ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/libert%c3%a9,_%c3%a9galit%c3%a9,_fraternit%c3%a9 ) each time . 
  that 's not the oxford comma . 
  it 's just that it has become too tumblry and memey nowadays , like * woke * , * lit * , * fam * , etc. 
  i know it 's a perfectly cromulent word , but it still rubs me the wrong way to read `` shook '' in a newspaper 's article . 
  they work better in the wide american streets , but european city streets are considerably narrower , which makes the situation worse . 
  especially in warmer areas , where the heat gets trapped between the buildings and the concrete , it 's like hell in summer . 
  then search for it and find it yourself . 
  last night , i was reading about the flood problem in dhaka from a local bangladeshi internet source . 
  and i was free to do it precisely because there 's media freedom in my country ( not perfect , but better than the world average ) . 
  if i was living in certain other parts of the world , i would n't have that option . 
  nobody is stopping you from educating yourself about anything going on in the world . 
  at least not while you 're living in a country with free press and unblocked internet access . 
  i 'm sure germany would also not allow americans and japanese people who are german citizens to vote on a referendum like this one . 
  this is not germany interfering in another country 's politics ; this is germany making sure its own citizens do n't violate german law . 
  it 's under-reported because it 's not globally relevant . 
  what 's going on in mongolia , uzbekistan , or mozambique does n't affect the average american , frenchman , or german much . 
  so , why would they be interested in what 's going on there ? 
  do n't forget that the press is a collection of media , which are * businesses * . 
  they employ people and need success and profits to sustain themselves and pay their employees . 
  they 're not going to cover issues that people are n't interested in , because of the little profit involved . 
  even places like iraq and syria would n't be as covered if isil was n't exporting terrorism to the west , making it an important subject for european media to cover . 
  you seem to see the press as a one-sided collective hivemind , which it clearly is n't . 
  different media are biased towards different goals and provide a diverse coverage and alternative points of view on individual news . 
  this way , people reading/watching these news have * free * options to choose from , compare them , and educate themselves ( although few people actually do that ) . 
  if you take the freedom from the press , you make all of them report the same one-sided thing for the same political agenda . 
  how is this better and/or the same ? 
  he 's from luxembourg , which has french as one of its official ( and most spoken ) languages . 
   english has been the dominant global language for well over 100 years . 
  maybe globally , but not in europe . 
  french had been the dominant european lingua franca until * at least wwii * . 
  the importance of english was elevated after that , mainly because of american hegemony in media and subcultural exports . 
  too visible !, 
   i would n't recommend it , the place * smells * . 
  there 's an aqualand right next to it , though . 
  that 's very true . 
  spain and portugal have only a couple nationalistic far-right parties , which get  1 % of the vote ( lower than in any other european country ) precisely because their experience with nationalism is still too fresh .

   what is wrong with civil unions ? 
  civil unions are n't recognized equally to marriage and you do n't get to have the same rights and protections from the state , like when it comes to tax , healthcare , and inheritance benefits as well as life insurance , social security , etc. 
  civil unions are n't `` marriage minus religion '' , as many people think . 
  it 's a subpar form of marital union , which allows couples * only some * of the rights and benefits of a properly married couple . 
  sweden is an entirely different subject . 
  your government and politics are way too lenient . 
  denying other people a basic social right because it rustles your jimmies * is * textbook scummy . 
  substantial demographic shift is a * long * time from now ( if ever ) . 
  plus , native minority groups have n't even managed to push for constitutional recognition of their languages in france . 
  amending the french constitution to allow any islamic laws pass is next to impossible . 
  especially any laws messing with la\u00efcit\u00e9 , which not even the catholic church has managed to achieve . 
  we * do * have this word in our language ( * \u03bc\u03c0\u03ac\u03bd\u03ba\u03b1 * , pronounced / banka / ) , but it refers to the accumulation of money in the register of gambling activities ( casinos , lottery , electronic gaming , etc ) which shows the profound respect we have for banking . 
  good point !, 
  plus , the people in the more underdeveloped , rural , less populated regions can make their voice better heard by having their vote count 3x as much as mine does .

  syriza voters have the unique quality of being ex-pasok . 
  their holier-than-thou universe would implode if their leader agreed to cooperate . 
  perhaps they wonder why would you secretly talk to members of an extremist party , before imprisoning them . 
  ^ ( nowhere is safe from the baneposting . ), 
  this is n't a `` left '' vs `` right '' frame , it 's a `` corruption '' vs `` no-corruption '' frame . 
  you will be surprised if you study closer what type of politicians and voters left pasok and hijacked syriza , once it became apparent that the former started going against their interests . 
  same for smaller conservative parties . 
  they come from former nd . 
  and the situation is n't likely to get fixed , because the most energetic , uncorrupted and educated ( the young people ) do n't stay and try to fix the situation , but are constantly getting disappointed and keep immigrating abroad . 
  regardless if they lean towards the left or right . 
  and pol pot , you need a vessel to brew the stew in . 
  conveniently ignoring that the ` conservative ' 1990-1993 government increased the debt equally at half the time , by hiring their voters in the public sector and making deals with ` private endeavour ' businessmen . 
  in spirit and practice your typical conservative crony capitalism , with none of the petty ` left evil welfare ' excuses . 
  i did n't expect anything different than a one sided-analysis , to be honest . 
  it 's pretty apparent from the graph that there is no causation . 
  both ( pasok-papandreou ) and ( nd-mitsotakis ) appear to have skyrocketed the debt , and both tried to keep it in check ( pasok-papandreou , pasok-simitis and nd-karamanlis jr. ) . 
  if you were to establish a causation , it seems a more probable theory that joint eu-greece policy is to blame : that debt started skyrocketing once greece joined the eu , and went out of control with the global recession . 
  * ( but in every sunday lunch around an nd family table , you will hear how those dirty green and red socialists are to blame for every evil that has befallen this country , because our home-grown well-dressed republicans can never be wrong ) . 
  experience says that investors love their bipartisanship . 
  they do n't care which two parties are in power , as long as the situation is stable . 
  they will be more worried with syriza or nd not forming a majority government , rather than syriza itself . 
  it was a situation similar to syriza . 
  they governed for 5 years , the economy blew around 2009 , then they threw the hot potato to pasok and went into the background , to avoid impeachment . 
  only now it was a 7-month syriza government instead of a 2-year pasok one . 
  the more things change , the more they stay the same . 
  got ta love the way cowards and `` smart guys in the room '' operate . 
  they managed to throw the hot potato to pasok a little before it blew , and avoid impeachment till this day . 
  things will be a-ok for these smart guys in the room .

  the most recent article i read as an argument for this , said the ( greek ) banks took all the money . 
  the local news for the past years say that banks do no give loans , so it 's apparent that whatever money greece is getting , it does n't trickle down to the people .

  surely germany was a main benefactor of nato but forgot all this moral rhetoric about it . 
  german army showed up in nato exercise with broomsticks . 
  so when it comes to europe 's defense , germans have another set of morality ? 
  greece on the other hand due to its location has to spend about 7 % of its budget to the military . 
  in fact greece and us are the only countries in nato that spend over 2 % . 
  do you think portugal would perform so admirably if had to do the same ? 
  do you understand what 7 % means ?

  the `` only a greek '' attitude , is it mainstream in germany ? 
  retirement age at 50 was a very very rare thing to happen and only in certain conditions where the `` profession '' was very harmful to worker 's health or cases of single mothers with more than 4 children etc. 
  totally yellow journalism myth . 
  also the public workers numbers include the army ( going to the army is mandate for all males in greece ) . 
  greece far worse when it all started . 
  get it . 
  you do n't give the same medicine to both flue and cancer patients . 
  it is that simple . 
  the program applied in greece by the troika was dead wrong . 
  imf acknowledged it . 
  did n't the news reached you yet ? 
  it took them some years to admit it but they finally stated the obvious : `` imf angry at greeks but frustrated at euro zone too . '', 
  but by mentioning financing , the imf also wanted to signal is exasperation at european governments ' refusal to discuss debt relief for greece , without which imf officials say the country 's finances simply wo n't be sustainable . 
  there : http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/06/12/eurozone-greece-imf-idusl5n0yy2a720150612 p.s. 
  are we clear with the `` only a greek '' part ? 
  do n't see it happening , it 's a tag o'war at the moment . 
  and it looks like it 's going belly up . 
  * `` only a greek ? 
  '' * what is this dude ? 
  seriously ? 
  i am not talking here as a greek representative , yet what i say you apply to characterize a whole nation ? 
  a racist overtone ? 
  lol how pathetic !, 
  fyi i 'm frank not greece !, 
  no chance was ever given to us to `` get our shit together '' cause the fucking austerity in the middle of a severe economic crisis ( much more severe another magnitude actually than the one in portugal ) doesnt fucking work . 
  nobel prize holders even said so but i guess you know better than them too !, 
  greek economic indicators were facing upwards at the end of 2014 for the sole reason that while income was fallen by 30 % the taxes risen by 270 % . 
  do your genius mind find that sustainable ? 
  again every serious economist on the globe including nobel prize winners and the imf itself said so . 
  but i guess you know better . 
  there was no light at the end of the tunnel and that 's what you do n't get . 
  all this by the troika planning itself is unsustainable . 
  but hey !, 
  do n't listen to me , listen to the imf but surely not bild . 
  and if you digg a bit deeper you 'll find out that portugal ( unfortunately ) is not out of the woods . 
  it should n't . 
  we do n't want you to pick up the tab . 
  we were n't allowed to go belly up in 2010 . 
  we should have defaulted then . 
  no one asked for your money then . 
  no one 's asking you to pick up the tab . 
  it is your government that decided to bail out private banks . 
  it would n't go down well if they told you that , so instead named it `` greek bailout '' . 
  that disgusts me , calling their banking bailout `` solidarity '' and all that crap . 
  the part of the debt that was `` forgiven '' was all privately held . 
  like 90 % was from greek ( and some cypriot ) institutions and banks . 
  no european tax payers money were lost on that . 
  in fact it was something that the troika demanded so ** afterwards ** your governments would use your taxes payers money to buy the remaining debt . 
  why cause it was held mainly by german and french banks . 
  it is them that decided to use your money not to save greece ( those money never came to greece ) but so to protect some of their banks regardless if such a move would be harmful to greece . 
  read this to be properly informed and not bild : http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/economics/11654639/imf-has-betrayed-its-mission-in-greece-captive-to-emu-creditors.html, 
  you do n't get it do you ? 
  lem me break it down for you then . 
  no one follows merkel-hitler pictures here . 
  what happened is that during a demonstration 5 or 10 idiots did it to get their 15minutes of fame . 
  one the other hand how many millions do give their money to buy shit like bild ? 
  yeah it is so . 
  if our humor is being measured by the standards , subtlety and finesse of german humor then i should thank you for that great compliment !, 
  / s :d, 
  also personally and all greeks suffered a lot from turkey . 
  if you wan na know , you can always ask but do n't make assumptions . 
  no it is not mocking them . 
  and it is also irrelevant . 
  we could be mocking tsipras with a sketch of bundestag with a swastika on top but it would still be offensive to you . 
  would you find it funny or insulting . 
  if you wan na mock turks & germans you could always use your national symbols ... also this is but one example . 
  wan na show you many more ? 
  with photoshoped statues giving the finger ? 
  newspapers calling us cons ? 
  asking us to sell the islands ? 
  to sell the acropolis ? 
  wan na see german politicians calling us lazy ? 
  please lets not get into that crap . 
  acropolis and parthenon is our national symbol . 
  a turkish flag on it is truly offensive given what we suffered from them and all the wars we 've given to gain our indipendence . 
  yes it very insulting to us . 
  do you really not get it ? 
   how did we actually get here ? 
  all i did was pointing out that the survey was conducted before the mentioned headlines . 
  we came to this cause we were supposedly respond to spakolos ' post , and not on wether the german gov up to a point `` was still in the position that publicly thinking about a grexit was detrimental '' ( which is also false ) . 
  all and all germany should do whatever finds best for its citizens , that 's what they 've been doing from the start . 
  and cut all the crap about solidarity etc. 
  as for sch\u00e4uble having the nerve to give lectures on our morality ... he better shut the fuck up . 
  he aint in the position to do so . 
  not to us , and i wonder how come people there can not see it . 
  and the germans at the end lost the war because of our contribution too . 
  i 'd call it a tie !,

  they were trying to turn germany against the soviets . 
  but when the soviets do the same to buy time they 're the evil ones . 
  the joke lies in the number of times our neighbors violate our airspace but i 'm not even complaining , this is also pretty accurate lol . 
  dude we had like 300 violations by turkish jets in a day . 
  give me my prize, 
  what the hell are you guys doing up there ? 
  and why are n't we in this party too ? 
  we should prepare a list for the past 12 years . 
  it should take us 12 damn years to finish the list = /, 
  turkey is not considered to have the 8th most powerful military , unless you 're talking strictly numbers which is what websites like these are doing and it 's why they 're not really reliable . 
  australia is ranked higher than greece in globalfirepower but if you compare the tanks/aircrafts/navy for example , greece is way higher . 
  these websites take into consideration a shitload of other things even the acreage , and they 're not really reliable to compare militaries . 
  regardless of the rank in these websites , turkey is not as high as you think it is . 
  it 's pretty close equipment-wise again considering the big gap in the two countries ' population gap . 
  having the same number a jets , similar naval power and only 1000 tanks less than a country that 's much bigger and 7 times more populous is not bad . 
  they were still countries that could put up a fight and they did ( serbia , hungary etc ) . 
  that 's why progress to vienna was pretty slow . 
  some battles were critical and europe was barely saved ( vienna , malta etc. ), 
  of course others like lepanto were much easier and decisive . 
  cheats mate , cheats !, 
  as if russia would go against europe and the usa just for turkey . 
  chances are they 'd also declare war on turkey to grap a piece of the pie . 
  greece alone would be enough to be the downfall of turkey in any such endeavour . 
  even if greece lost in the end ( which is a strong possibility due to numbers alone ) , the attrition and casualties dealt to turkey would be immense . 
  they would n't be able to move anywhere else . 
  greece has frightning numbers of tanks/boats/aircraft for its size/population . 
  it 's nearly on par with turkey which has 7 times greece 's population . 
  were n't these moved by the usa a couple of years ago ? 
  i do n't think they 're still in incirlik . 
   launch a couple of nukes at ankara , istanbul etc ? 
  reporting you for friendly fire , we 're neaby you assholes !, 
  motherlaaaaaand !!, 
  not that i 'm insulted or anything or that i disagree that there 's quite a big danger of what you described actually happening . 
  quite the contrary . 
  but let 's not kid ourselves by pretending that this is not already happening as the olympics are currently . 
  there 's a shitload of people in these commissions making a shitload of illegal money already . 
  on one hand i 'm thinking that this should be nice as a symbolic move and all , but on the other i think that it would basically defile the place if you think of all the infrastructure that would have to be built , all the people that would visit and the fact that the olympics today are sadly all about money and advertisment . 
  an awesome song to tell the tale of one of the most tragic battles in human history . 
  iron maiden did a great job there . 
  such a tragic waste of human life . 
  lest we forget `` home , far away from the war , a chance to live again . 
  home , far away . 
  but the war ... no chance to live again '', 
   the summer makes me feel groggy and depressed , to be honest . 
  i 'm happiest when it 's dark and cloudy . 
  :( i found the spy , guys !, 
  ah yes i 'm subscribed to that channel . 
  great source of songs/bands but they 're just so many . 
  i know of naxatras but honestly i 've never listened to their music , it 's time now i guess , 
   iah if you mean [ these ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=funwozjriro ) guys , they seem to be from argentina . 
  very cool album anyway , thanks for your comment i found a new band :d if you were talking about a different band , let me know please . 
  i 'm curious . 
  edit : some cool greek bands that you can check out ( although if you 're into that kind of music you might already know them ) are planet of zeus , 1000mods and if you like something heavier more towards post metal / sludge , i can recommend fields of locust , they 're a great band, 
  i was so glad to see a metal band in there , that even i voted and i despise that joke of a competition . 
  it helped that those guys were pretty cool and the song was damn catchy too . 
  love them !, 
  seen them live 3 times , 
  it 's almost as if that 's exactly why in my comment i said `` i hate it when people use it everywhere without knowing what it means '' . 
  dude think about what you just typed . 
  this means that italy has almost 6 billion bands or that every person is in 97 bands which is retarded . 
  this is exactly why `` per capita '' in this situation is wrong . 
  the right analogy is - as the map says - bands per 1 million people , not per capita . 
  97 bands for every 1 million people , not for every single person . 
  jesus , how did you guys graduate ? 
  lmao so accurate, 
  personally i dislike that as well , for the same reason i dislike the animal acts in circuses . 
  not to mention that it 's dangerous for the human and it can still lead to people getting killed which is the other obvious downside of bullfights . 
  but the fact that at least the animal does n't die in the end is some improvement i guess . 
  no dude , my final point does n't mean that i value one life over the other . 
  it simply means that one occasion gets more publicity than your random every day loss of life and it will trigger more reactions . 
  is one life worth more than the other ? 
  do the circumstances of the first make it more known though ? 
  yes . 
  likewise , pigs that are tortured behind closed doors ( for good reason because if they were made public there would also be an outrage ) in slaughterhouses naturally do not get the same publicity as killing bulls in huge ass stadiums full of cheering people while it 's legal , does . 
  one is different because it done for entertainment and it 's sanctioned . 
  the other is n't , it 's happening in secret . 
  it 's like comparing a standard homicide with pitting humans to kill each other in an arena with the approval of the government and lots of people . 
  in both cases the lives have the same value but the latter will naturally cause a shitload more of a shitstorm . 
  if you ca n't understand the reason , i ca n't help you any more . 
  your original point is non-existent cause you 're basically saying that you ca n't judge or criticize other traditions while there are other examples of the same thing ( which i repeat , is not the same thing but anyway ) in every country . 
  this is retarded cause this can also work the other way around and i can say that we should n't be complaining about pigs to be slaughtered in inhumane ways either , as long as there are bullfights . 
  you 're basically suggesting that we should stop the criticism until we 're ready to somehow end all animal abuse everywhere simultaneously , otherwise we 're making a fool out of ourselves ? 
  okay ... 
  the spanish are being pointed at cause it 's a popular tradition with a shitload of people attending and actually enjoying that shit . 
  obviously it 's not all of them and if we 're to believe our spaniard users above , more and more people criticize it which is a good thing , but still you do n't see people in other countries cheering at the torturing of piglets do you ? 
  and if we did , we would be complaining about them too . 
  what you 're basically saying is that our morality is somehow fake cause we 're criticizing a spectacle that takes place in public sanctioned by local authorities and the government , while we do n't care about animal torturing that happens in random slaughterhouses behind closed doors . 
  this is as stupid as me telling you to calm down with your moral outrage if you condemn a serial killer cause `` people die all the time all over the world so meh ... '' . 
  it 's retarded . 
  which is inhumane and also to be criticized but still not quite on the same level of it being nation-wide accepted and celebrated as sport or entertainment in arenas with tens of thousands of spectators . 
  what do n't you understand and what is your point ? 
  that since once exists so should the other ? 
  both should be stopped . 
  they do n't typically put them in a huge stadium for people to watch them being slaughtered for entertainment , or they set their ears on fire for fun . 
  wtf are you on about ? 
  i 'm obviously against the unnecessary torture of animals like pigs when they 're to be slaughtered like we 've seen in some videos where they kill them slowly but at least these are not being done with full publicity and a crowd of people cheering . 
  do n't compare irrelevant things . 
  to my knowledge criticism against bullfights is way more intense than criticism about black pete . 
  that 's the thing . 
  pressure towards the government must be increased at some point in order to end it eventually , if that 's what you actually want .

  all that time i was thinking kilkenny was a south park reference . 
  about tree fiddy . 
  we have been called both gay and pigs but not both at the same time . 
  it 's an improvement i guess ? 
  i remember reading about a town , i think in germany , that removed traffic lights and that made drivers more careful . 
  good luck , just ... do n't make another no man 's sky . 
  that reminded me of regular ordinary swedish meal time . 
  we are so good , we are the best at being poor too . 
  ask anyone !, 
  that 's what paradox games are there for . 
  turkey did invaded cyprus , it 's not like it 's unprecedented for nato . 
  i guess diplomacy and international laws were on their day-off then . 
  i really do not understand why articles that are already proven to be misleading are not removed . 
   india share of global gdp was 23-30 % for most of 2000 years . 
  when british left in 1947 it was less than 4 % . 
  what was the reason for that ? 
  were there attempts to divide bosnia even during the yugoslav period ? 
  after playing `` find the croats '' with this map , i give up . 
  where are they ? 
  edit : found it !, 
  thanks . 
  i grew up surrounded by communist states . 
  i know very well how shitty communism handled things . 
  i also know how shitty fascism/nazism handled things too . 
  we had those people here . 
  in spain too . 
  not to mention italy and germany . 
  i just ca n't accept it dismissed so easily . 
  `` i would choose fascism in a heartbeat '' is a very disingenuous thing to say , and it makes me think that whoever says it is a secret sympathizer . 
  many times it 's true , i agree . 
  but in this post , people took a single chart as an opportunity to say how bad communism is . 
  it 's like , to use your example , taking a chart of jewish population in germany , noticing the decline during hitler and saying `` nazism is bad , kids . '', 
  not to mention those that say fascism is preferable to communism , like it 's a competition for which authoritarian dystopia is less shitty . 
  notice that i said anti-communism , not anti-stalin . 
  fuck stalin . 
  and fuck hitler , too . 
  btw , where did you see an anti-hitler circlejerk in this thread ? 
  username checks out . 
  the anti-communism circlejerk is strong here . 
  there are even a few that claim that fascism is better . 
  good job / r/europe . 
  again you conveniently did n't mention george papandreou who artificially inflated the greek debt to force the imf on us . 
  and saying that simitis did well ? 
  the same guy that got us on the euro on fabricated statistics ? 
  no , we understand that erdo\u011fan has huge popular support on the purges . 
  we still do n't like them though , because they remind us of the darkest moments of european history and also of similar purges from known dictators . 
  he is pro-erdogan . 
  whether this equals pro-turkey remains to be seen . 
  what about the other two thirds ? 
  if you arrest him just to make him pay a fine he will be a martyr . 
  you need to find a way to press more serious charges and imprison him or at the very least remove him from his position as a religious authority . 
  death penalty for what crime ? 
  according to google , distance between turkey and china is 5,946 km . 
  as a comparison , distance between france and russia is mostly the same ( 6,217 km ) . 
  would you say that france is between spain , britain and russia ? 
   turkish politics are extremely complicated all countries ' politics are , do n't act like you are some special case . 
   china wat, 
   on their `` military '' i see where this is going . 
  it 's the same flip-flopping he did with israel tbh . 
  easy to say , but it is we who have to live next to that paranoid madman . 
  it 's true though . 
   all but uk and poland france , greece and turkey have same military expenditures ( as gdp % ) as the uk . 
  estonia has more than poland . 
  so i do n't know what you 're talking about . 
  it 's the same here . 
  if you wanted to achieve anything worthwhile you had to move to athens . 
  you did n't address any of my points but i do n't care to be honest . 
  i just made a joke . 
  i really do n't want to have to that discussion again . 
  another one that says i 'm blaming others . 
  where in my post did i do that ? 
  i 'm just questioning europe 's desire or ability to offer real solidarity . 
  we have n't seen much in greece ( yes our situation is our fault ) , we have n't seen much in ukraine either . 
  hell , cyprus is being occupied for 42 years , they joined the eu and still nothing happened to solve anything . 
  at most i expect some strong words and maybe a loose embargo . 
  and where in my post did i do that ? 
  and what does that article have to do with anything ? 
  i do n't get your point . 
  you 'll get your money back anyway , it was a loan not a gift . 
  as for `` cultural problems '' i 'd rather make no comment at all , as it would n't be a nice one . 
  anyway , there 's no need to turn this into a discussion about greece . 
  my post was more of a joke but some people are immune to them . 
  judging from past years , allow me to be skeptical of european solidarity . 
  germany does n't have * millions of syrian refugees * , no country in the eu has . 
  what millions ? 
  see how merkel encourages those dirty immigrants to murder people with d\u00f6ner knives !, 
  it 's all her fault !, 
  `` help help i 'm being repressed ! '', 
  the greek crisis started a lot earlier than 2015 , just saying . 
   the family he later stabbed rescued him how fucked up must someone be to do such a thing . 
  why kill them all when you can kill a few and terrorize the rest ? 
  if some will not be sufficiently terrorized , they could be killed at a later time , for a different crime . 
  i would n't call that `` might '' , not is it comparable to what hitler did . 
  ~ ~ hitler was n't elected . ~ ~ apparently i was wrong , disregard this post . 
  i 'm sure if war was waging in your country you would n't wait for permission . 
  in fact , that 's exactly what happened during the yugoslav war and i do n't recall any country building walls to stop anyone . 
  they were n't even immigrants to their country , they were only passing by on their way to germany . 
  with your logic , they will make other countries worse by moving there . 
  especially when it was obvious the migrants never intended to stay , only cross the country on their way to ( mostly ) germany . 
  did n't they recently constructed a wall so that they wo n't have any migrants ?

  and here we are ... 
  i think it is more likely to die from an islamist attack in paris than in the tourist areas of turkey . 
  there have n't been any riots , because they can leave turkey any time . 
  if they come to greece they are stuck here , because they can not legally move to other eu countries ( dublin ii regulation ) . 
  they ca n't enter our watebs !, 
  sounds like ... https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/aegean_dispute, 
  they did target everyone who opposed communism . 
  non-communists might not have been exactly a race or ethnic minority , but you could still describe it as genocide . 
  genocide during peacetime is probably worse . 
  i mean when a 17n member had broken out of prison , the us embassy went nuts , demanding his immediate prosecution and `` softly threatened '' the greek government . 
  who knows , maybe it was all a ploy !, 
   that the marxist terrorist organisation 17n was actually controlled by pasok / the communist party/the secret service / ** the americans ** . 
  but 17n killed cia agents in greece , it does n't make sense . 
   the only big and widely accepted conspiracy theory is that the whole world is conspiring against turkey . 
  sounds exactly like greece . 
  it is far easier to gross 20k euros as a 1-person business in austria than in greece though . 
  it 's not about having balls or not . 
  until the eu recognizes crimea as russian territory , no one should accept these passports . 
  to be fair , i do n't really care . 
  to be fair , it 's not like they would n't have to pay for the products , so the poor would still remain poor . 
  the left platform has majority in the central committee of syriza , but are a minority in the parliament . 
  normally the committee has higher power than the pm , but tsipras claims that the people that voted syriza , voted the pro-eu syriza and not the left platform . 
  he is implying that the left platform hid their ulterior motive behind a pro-eu party and deceived the people . 
  he is proposing many things , including a public ballot vote where people will decide the future of syriza . 
  if you ask me it is another example of the design flaws of syriza and their hunger for power without any preparation . 
  they are getting self-destructed . 
  the question is not the chance of syriza dissolving , that 's granted . 
  the question is what is the probability of the left platform taking over the party , leading tsipras into making a new party . 
  just do n't get bankrupt and make us send esm money to you in the future / s, 
  thank you based bulgaria for not making fun of us . 
  cyprus is n't greek territory . 
  i do n't see how the situations are comparable . 
  our politicians are really good at being bad , so i guess you are right !, 
  most are conscripts , with an 8 euro , ** yes 8 euro ** monthly wage . 
  obviously yes . 
  even if we have a war , can you even transport and fit 100k soldiers in an island like imia ? 
  i do n't think so ... 
  but the politicians have convinced us that we need even more soldiers because `` turkey '' . 
  meanwhile estonia has 6k soldiers with all the tensions with russia . 
  selling the railway for 0 euro would be a success , it has insanely high upkeep costs . 
  you know one hectar in far eastern russia probably costs like half a square meter in manhattan . 
  only one hectare ? 
  i mean they could give a hundred and still have plenty left . 
  biggest fucking country in the world or sth ... 
  they can do what many farmers have done in greece , circumvent traditional retailers and sell the products to the consumers on their own , by establishing a cooperative retail chain . 
  one great example is this : http://www.thesgala.gr/en.html, 
  insurance ( medical and pension ) in greece is about 43 % of your gross salary . 
  they do it because it is worth the risk of getting caught and fined . 
  if it is more dangerous to risk to come to europe than to stay even temporarily in their own country , i do n't see how they could be defined as asylum seekers . 
  if bombs are falling all over you , you flee immediately , you do n't wait . 
  how to identify if they are fake refugees : are there about half as many women in the group ? 
  they are real refugees . 
  are there few to none women in the group ? 
  they are fake refugees . 
  how can bosnia have more unemployment than kosovo ? 
  so an equivalent of just about 270km of brand new autobahn ? 
  i do n't see how this is the biggest modernization campaign for germany . 
  honestly , i pretty much think that we have reached the point that we do n't care any more about the damn metopes . 
  just do n't bleach them any further , k ? 
  i 'm pretty sure in malia the hotels / bars are not those who are complaining but the old poor citizens that do n't make money of tourism . 
  we have to make them understand that their way of life is not acceptable here and they have to respect the people giving them aid . 
   what is the solution ? 
  fortress europe ? 
  the only solution is to help their countries with proper humanitarian aid and find a way to stop the wars in the middle east , it will be cheaper in the long run . 
  we also have to invest in northern africa and the middle east to further stabilize the area . 
  the prices did correct themselves a few years later . 
  when oil became much more expensive , prices did n't increase as much as they normally would . 
  consumption did n't fall , but that 's because due to the price hikes creating an elite retail middle class with disposable income . 
  if you had a cafeteria or a restaurant you would see your net earnings double or even triple . 
  they would use this money to buy more luxury goods , build a second house etc. 
  this map is so wrong i would trust anecdotal evidence any day . 
  it 's not our fault the one who made the map was smoking something ... 
  the biggest fast food chain is goodys anyway . 
  they invented biological warfare without knowing . 
  there is a 75.8 % home ownership , but that includes a high amount of mortgages ( usually the same price as rent ) or even having an old-ass house in a village while you work and live in the city where you need to rent . 
  also , being more productive when working less does n't mean you work smarter or harder . 
  it just means more capital investments and thus technological innovations have happened in your country allowing you to produce more by working less . 
  rent in greece costs at least 200 euros a month though for a shitty flat . 
  you need 250-300 euros for something decent . 
  you can use e-banking and credit / debit cards without any limit as long as the money is kept within greece . 
  if the greek debt got erased it would still be at least 10 years until greece could loan with low interest rates . 
  we stopped buying german products in greece for a while , not because of boycotting but because we run out of moneys . 
  it 's because it ca n't compete with our awesome greek fast food . 
  it did bad before the crisis , but since the crisis started stores started closing . 
  if you walked past a greek mcdonald 's you would only notice chinese tourists eating there . 
  mcdonald 's is crap , but burger king is awesome . 
  bk is planning to open stores in greece . 
  it 's hard to make a greek big mac index as mcdonalds failed here . 
  there are less than 10 mcdonalds stores in the whole country !, 
  how about a souvlaki / gyros index instead ? 
  greek communists being furious is no sign at all . 
  they are always furious and they will always say no to everything . 
  giscard hates us now http://www.ekathimerini.com/199059/article/ekathimerini/news/suspend-greece-from-euro-says-former-french-president-giscard-destaing i just hope he is just getting old and retarded and does n't mean it . 
  parliaments are people now . 
  so , nuclear family flag ? 
  do yet another referendum !, 
  and then his party did nothing to oppose the nomenklatura , instead they embraced it . 
   but he 's absolutely right that greece would be in more trouble now without the eu than it would be with it . 
  how so ? 
  if greece never joined the eu , cheap credit would n't be available and thus we would n't be in the clusterfuck of a default .

   venetians were not civilized against you moron . 
  your people and region suffered much from those cunts . 
  i come from a region that prospered during venetian rule . 
  you think you know better than me ? 
  the ottomans were the real cunts . 
  bringing constantinople into the discussion is ridiculous . 
  it was their capital of course they will pay more attention to their capital . 
  the other regions suffered . 
  btw constantinople was great centuries before the ottomans . 
   then stop talking like him . 
  i 'm not even remotely talking like him . 
  treacherous for preferring venetians over ottomans ? 
  use your mind . . 
   what a proud greek . 
  pride has nothing to do with this . 
  if i had to choose over civilized venetians and backwards ottomans , of course i choose venetians for many reasons . 
  venetians are european too so that 's the biggest reason tbh  apparently advanced enough to hold onto and rule that territories for so long . 
  they turned into shit everything they took . 
   i do n't know how to respond to that . 
  you talk like trump . 
  i 'm telling my opinion on the ottomans , what 's wrong with that ? 
  what is wrong with you ? 
  of course we prefer venetian over ottoman rule . 
  why do some turkish redditors pretend that they 're kemalists but at the same time defend the ottomans ? 
  the ottoman empire was backwards and a disaster . 
  venetian rule in crete for example was a very brilliant age . 
  ottomans on the other hand managed to ruin the island . 
  not the biggest part of croatia and not for a long time, 
  empire total war anyone ? 
  croats were so fortunate that the biggest chunk of their country never fell under ottoman rule, 
  you keep trolling because of course you have no answer to give, 
  that 's exactly how you call them and stop lying . 
  you call them macedonians . 
  and trust me , most greeks do n't give a fuck about that name dispute because we have bigger problems to solve . 
  btw the guy you answered to is a troll, 
  you are more anti-slavomacedonian than they are anti-hellenic . 
  ok i agree that their attempts to portray themselves as the `` true '' macedonians are ridiculous but you ca n't have a monopoly over the name and you must live with it . 
  macedonia is a big region that exceeds greek borders . 
  so our slavic neighbors are macedonians too , not greek , but slavic . 
  no reason to be butthurt over this your comparison with crimea is ridiculous because it 's not a naming dispute , it 's russia that illegally invaded and is still occupying ukrainian soil . 
  the same thing turkey did in cyprus . 
  germany and belgium were looking nice, 
  exactly . 
  although erdogan seems more and more to trying to distance himself from the west , and that 's a problem, 
  you sound so butthurt and ridiculous . 
  are you done with your bullshit ? 
  it 's just a name , btw your comparison with crimea is ridiculous and shows that you 're a butthurt 10 year old who knows nothing about politics . 
  crimea was illegally taken away from ukraine . 
  macedonia is just a name , get over it . 
  do n't pay attention to him . 
  he even compared the name dispute to crimea . 
   such as their `` alliance '' with nazi germany . 
  what do you mean with that ? 
  yes in my original comment i implied it was probably a historical map so you are right . 
  every country has maps like these anyway, 
  there 's always something new at the balkans . . a friend 's brother visited serbia for a business trip , during his stay he visited a school and told us that in their classes they had a map of a `` greater serbia '' spanning from eastern croatia to central greece . 
  pretty much almost all yugoslavia with some extra additions . 
  of course it could be a historical map or something because serbian lords had conquered parts of greece , but i do n't know . 
  the situation in the balkans is weird , so many nationalities , so many wars , constant provocations from every side . 
   thats what i disagree about , in my opinion heroes are people who did that little extra and more , not people who are fighting cancer , or firefighters doing their job . 
  okay but you already know that many people will disagree with you the same way you disagree with me  not the majority though , being a collaborator wasnt for sure the normal thing to do . 
  most people in greece resisted actively or passively . 
  so are you trying to argue that people in greece who fought and died are n't considered heroes by greeks ? 
  at least in greece , where we all know people like to overreact sometimes , many people who died fighting the enemy are considered heroes . 
  i do n't know about other countries, 
   i called you a prick because that was true . 
  so if i call you a piece of shit it 's true ? 
  wut  the guy was just asking a simpel question , because he 's curious he knew that he was going to get answers like mine though, 
   he 's your nemesis he 's not my nemesis , where did you got that from ? 
  i 'm going to ignore your remaining comment because you opened up a very different discussion, 
  truth be told , most countries have committed ethnic cleansings or something similar . 
  i 'm the first to admit that my country , greece , killed and drove off many slavic people in northern greece in order to win wars and achieve goals this greek man fought for greece , europe and the usa , not * just * the usa, 
  well tbh i had a bad day and i overreacted now but you called me a prick and told me that i was being aggressive for simply saying something . 
  `` hero '' does n't mean being leonidas or horatio nelson . . heroes can be everyday people like doctors who save lives , and yes , people who fought off nazis and liberated others are considered heroes . 
   but because it was the normal thing to do many people co-operated with the nazis so for them resisting invasion was n't the normal thing to do, 
  a prick ? 
  :d was i being agressive in my previous comment ? 
  well i explained the reason he is considered a hero tbh . 
  for example some turks consider kemal as a hero but armenians do n't . 
  a hero has many different meanings and he should have wondered what does a hero means before making that question, 
  well that 's true, 
  i guess for risking his life to save europe from nazi pricks ? 
  at least he was n't cleansing armenian and kurdish families from their homes . 
  it just makes no sense . . 
  yup , and i 'm still here waiting for my source, 
   kissinger literally told turkey they can have all of cyprus source ? 
  very true , that `` do n't take erdogan serious '' bullshit has been commented many times now . 
  i do n't know about slovenes but they are certainly not balkan and greece culturally is on par with spain and italy , so yeah , i would n't call us balkan, 
  ex yugos love their athletes apparently , but what 's the macedonian one ? 
  i doubt that aliagas is so famous in greek twitter . 
  does he tweet in greek or something ? 
  i highly doubt that actually, 
  very true, 
  after all the things your soldiers did in ukraine , you coming here and saying something like that is weird, 
  no , it 's not like that . 
  do you think that those greek politicians are not to blame at all ? 
   if you start identifying as english and the rest of the english accept you as such , then yes , sure am i born and raised in england ? 
  because that matters the most  i 'm glad that you agree that a random x or y who grew up in greece does n't magically become greek , after all golden dawn says so , right ? 
  in my opinion , you can be greek only if you 're born and raised in greece and identify as a greek . 
  ancestry of course does n't matter at all .

  aside from overly baddass keyboard warrior statements , how do you expect this will solve the migrant crisis ? 
  how ` bout that funding we had been asking for before the whole crisis even begun ? 
  grow a pair , get invaded by turkey and/or drown unarmed people ? 
  i would call that suicide , not growing a pair . 
  if you want it so badly , you 're welcome to come down here and do it yourself . 
  you 're using logic , that 's not fair . 
  ** 1299 ** - following a revolt from cretan aristocracy , led by alexios callerges , the venetians grant several priviledges to the local nobles . 
  ** 1897 ** - greek troops withdraw from crete . 
  in return , the ottoman empire transforms crete into an autonomous principality , with the greek crown prince as its head of state and the future greek pm eleutherios venizelos as its prime minister . 
  title error , they were actually 39 . 
   turkish aircraft formations violated greece 's national airspace ** 39 times ** , in various parts of the aegean , while greek and turkish fighters engaged in simulated dogfights during interception . 
  ** a pair of turkish f-16 flew over rho ** at 27.500 feet . 
   ** 3 turkish fighter squadrons ** entered the athens fir without submitting flight plans - two were pairs and one was comprised of six planes - 4 turkish naval cooperation aircraft and 9 helicopters . 
   18 violations of the athens fir 's air travel rules were recorded and 39 violations of the national airspace in the northeast , central and southeast aegean were recorded . 
   in all cases the turkish aircraft were designated and intercepted by equivalent greek fighters , while in ** 7 cases iconic dogfights ** occured between the two . 
   ** six turkish aircraft were armed . 
  if italy does turn out to be nearly as competent and advanced as the roman republic ( or at least machiavelli 's florence ) please , do consider annexing us . 
  after all , it was under the romans that greece experienced unparalleled prosperity after decades of war . 
  us be like : `` we should have never erased those gerries ' debts and rebuilt their damn country !, 
  we should have invested in france and let them starve instead ! '', 
  yeah your money ... 
   donaldos trympocles , \u0392\u0399\u03a3\u03a4 ' !, 
  ftfy, 
  wow what 's with all the angry comments ppl ; i 'm an athenian from an athenian family ( ie . 
  they did n't come to the capital from the provinces ) and i recognise that most of modern athens in ugly , like any major southern european city . 
  we could have made it better and we could make it better . 
  stop attacking the poor dude and talking shit about rome , yes it 's the same , but just 'cause the capital of the dude 's country is as bad as ours , does n't take truth away from what he said . 
  maybe we should take it into consideration and once , if ever , we get out of our current mess we could try to make athens ( this phrase has been ruined completely but i ca n't say it in any other way ) great again !, 
  it was great up until 1970 and it can be great again , even greater perhaps !, 
  international law ? 
  mighty rossiya laughs at such stupid concepts !, 
  [ 1788 called , the ancien r\u00e9gime wants its politics back . 
  indeed . 
  but two wrongs do n't make a right . 
  you do n't have to go to either extreme to fix anything . 
  you just need sanity . 
  i believe the 92 % refers to greek nationals . 
  until very recently , the only way to get greek nationality is if you had a greek parent . 
  jesus christ are you people blind ? 
  i said i 'm against mass migration , but electing anti-abortion numbnuts is not the way to solve it ... jesus . 
  as plato said , all men are worthy of those who lead them . 
  i do think so . 
  what i do n't understand , is all the downvotes and ridiculous assumptions , for stating something which is well known . 
  the whole point of a hyperbole is taking a statement ( or a train of thought , in this case ) to an extreme , so as to show how ridiculous it is . 
  if you take it literally , you must seriously go back to school . 
   the only progressive democracy in the middle east which may or may have not been involved in war crimes less than a year ago ... and which also happens to shit on human rights . 
  lebanon could have earned that label , tunisia too . 
  if you honestly thinks a party which commends fn 's policies is not regressive , [ how ` bout a party whose first elected official commended the thrid reich as `` economically efficient '' and is completely inconsistent with traditional classical european liberalism ? 
  ] ( http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/europe/at-political-parties-fpo.htm ) what if i told you the party in question [ supported sadam freaking hussein ? 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/freedom_party_of_austria#cite_note-87 ) the party is in league with putin 's united russia and the serbian progressive party . 
  if that 's not proof enough for you , there 's no point in trying to convince you . 
  i most certainly do . 
  did i ever say otherwise ? 
  hopefully . 
  maybe the austrians will take one for the team ? 
  i never distanced myself from anything . 
  you accused me of making a statement which i did not make . 
  we 're talking about a party that 's meeting with tea party leadership and commends israeli foreign policy . 
  a party that 's in league with the fn . 
  they are n't just right wing . 
  they 're far beyond that . 
  you 're free to be in denial about it , but do n't waste my time with strawmen . 
  what cliches did i precisely mention ? 
   you ca n't undue unchecked migration i believe you meant undo . 
  and on what most reliable data is that estimate based ? 
  not all european countries are faced with the same problems . 
  greece , for example , is 92 % ethnically white , christian , greek . 
  we do n't need the extreme measures for any racial issues . 
  even for those countries who do need it , a large part of their workforce is unskilled migrant labour . 
  if they go , what do you think will happen to the countries ' economies , economies which were built around unchecked migration for decades ? 
  my point is , you have to solve the issue , but not with a jerknee overnight response ; you need long term , coordinated solutions , like migrant quotas , slow deportations , incentives to grow local populations etc. 
  far right populists rarely , if ever , have the brains for such solutions . 
  all hail the flying spaghetti monster !, 
  may his tomato sauce guide us to salvation !, 
  well , if you honestly think you 're better off being ruled by strongmen and kings in all but name , you did n't deserve democracy to begin with . 
  somebody who bases their election platform on merely dissing the establishment and telling people what they want to hear , without offering any real solutions , is , by definition , a demagogue . 
  i never said fpo will send austria back to the middle ages . 
  i was talking about the new-right in general and in a hyperbolic manner , none the less . 
  how about you drop that ironic tone and leave the strawman alone ? 
  from what i 've heard it 's originally from aristotle , but that 's none of our concern . 
  anyway , i think we 're in agreement . 
  have a nice day :d, 
  turkey is a nation built on blood , but all nations are built on blood . 
  the difference is that some of us recognise it and move on , while others do n't . 
  i just hope for turkey 's sake that they do the former . 
  to be honest your own country is the only thing we have close to an actual democracy , at least in the classical sense . 
  what we have right now are aristotelian republics . 
  it might certainly be effective in giving short term solutions and getting the demagogue in question popularity , but it creates far greater , long term problems both for the country the demagogue rules and those it influences . 
  austria has a very educated and cultivated population ; they are perfectly capable of having an actual democracy . 
  if they choose otherwise , they only confirm what aristotle said : `` those who choose safety over liberty , deserve neither . '', 
  new-right be like : `` we do n't want those women hating , anti-abortion , anti-democratic savages in our countries !, 
  so we 'll elect people who 'll kick them out and then send our societies back to the middle ages ourselves ! '', 
  i 'm not in favour of unchecked migration . 
  i also do n't like the fact that only the far right wants to deal with that problem . 
  but if you honestly think electing a bunch of demagogues because they deal with one issue that nobody else dares to touch , when they have absolutely horrible opinions for a plethora of other issues , is a good choice , democracy is doomed . 
  and this is n't just for austria ; this is for all of us . 
  so destroying our values in order to prevent them from coming here is your solution ? 
  what 's effective about it ? 
  populism is doing what the majority wants regardless of whether it 's the best choice . 
  it killed athenian democracy and it 's bound to kill any democracy that degenerates into it .

  no idea what the merit is in that statement though . 
  was there any merit to their claims that iraq has wmd ? 
  eventually there comes a point where you need to stop trusting people who sell you fear , and are repeatedly proven to be wrong . 
  maybe if you did n't make up stuff , they would n't seem to ludicrous . 
  i do n't know if the us air force is overfunded and i did n't claim that it is ; the point is that if your own security services ( while being generously funded ) can not stop terrorists attacks ( that are easier to stop ) then maybe you should n't blame others ? 
  maybe such attacks are not easy to prevent so calling other people 's work `` shitty '' is unfair . 
  unless you are pushing an agenda , that is . 
  probably ? 
  a swede could differentiate between refugees over non-refugee local arabs that have been living in the country for generations . 
  in any case i do n't think you can always tell who the refugees are . 
  you do n't even go out much , so its a safe bet . 
  u.s. officials should bash the fact that they have the most powerful and expensive airforce in the world , but where defeated by box cutters . 
  this is merely agenda pushing . 
  if belgium 's security forces are shitty , every security force anywhere is shitty . 
  i do n't think so , especially not if you are a foreigner yourself . 
  alright , that makes more sense . 
  i guess i misunderstood you . 
  i disagree . 
  respecting someone 's * right to have a belief * is the key ; not respecting the belief itself . 
  i think its a subtle but extremely important difference . 
  what are you talking about ? 
  lived for 27 years in greece and i never encountered anyone living on favor-exchanges . 
  closest i saw was `` help me paint my room in exchange for a pizza '' or something like that . 
  for things that matter like rent , gas , groceries for your family etc people always pay with money . 
  the fact is that right-wingers and jihadis share a common enemy too : progressives . 
  does that mean they are allies ? 
  why is it stupid to not respect racist beliefs ? 
  one can only dream ... 
  its difficult to replace cash under the table with sheep or hay . 
  and what are those better ways to combat tax evasion ? 
  to me it seems like we have been in `` desperation mode '' the past few years so any solution would be welcome . 
   in reality it does work that way . 
  if you 're paying cash the transaction goes from buyer to seller . 
  and the only trace is receipt . 
  going cashless is adding one more party to the equation - the bank . 
  and the only task bank have to do is to change the numbers between two accounts and note the transaction . 
  and you have no right over that information ? 
  can the bank do with it whatever it wants ? 
  i 've yet to see this amazing alliance between left wingers and * conservative * muslims . 
  i 've heard right wingers complain about it , sure , but never any concrete evidence . 
  umm because i am stupid ? 
  you are right , i should have replied to him/her ... 
  sounds like the average right-winger to me . 
  progress is bad , the west is corrupt , gays are destroying the universe , etc. 
   i see groups of young men all the time that appear to be refugees . 
  i do n't really go out at night much so i ca n't speak to that . 
  no offence but are you basically admitting to not knowing ? 
  like you would n't know if those young people were refugees , but you assumed so anyway because of their behavior ? 
  people like to destroy other people , that is a fact lgbt folk are weak and vulnerable : they make the perfect target . 
   you ca n't just one day declare one thing that goes against mentality of entire generations and hope it goes well . 
  i do n't think anyone expected this to go well . 
  everyone knows that there are some people who will resist this . 
  this has nothing to do with muslims . 
  why this creepy fetishization with always changing the topic to be about muslims ? 
  i think this is a bad article , mostly consisting of fearmongering . 
   do we want this sector ( banking sector ) to have yet more power and influence ? 
  the author needs to argue * how * the sector is getting `` more power and influence '' if we go cashless . 
   in a world without cash , every payment you make will be traceable . 
  do you want governments ( which are not always benevolent ) , banks or payment processors to have potential access to that information ? 
  the power this would hand them is enormous and the potential scope for orwellian levels of surveillance is terrifying . 
  this is an interesting topic , but i 'd like to see better arguments . 
  what about privacy laws ? 
  just because you are paying online means you completely and irrevocably forfeit your privacy ? 
  i do n't think it works that way . 
   if your life savings were threatened with confiscation to bail out a corporation you considered profligate , i imagine you too would rush to withdraw them . 
  this is a strange argument . 
  we are ( and were , during 2008 ) living in a world full of cash ; that did not stop the government from bailing out the banks . 
  the idea that cash somehow empowers us in the fight against banks is demonstrably wrong . 
  in fact , its demonstrably wrong based on the same examples the author gave : greece and cyprus . 
  in both cases the government simply banned cash withdrawal . 
   but the main reason , simply , is that , to get a landline , you need a bank account and credit . 
  about half of the world 's population is `` unbanked '' , without access to the basic financial services you need . 
  ( ... ) the financial system was actually a barrier to progress for the world 's poor , while cash was a facilitator for them . 
  author is arguing against himself . 
  modern , digital and online banking services can easily reach those `` unbanked '' people . 
   if you listen to the scaremongering , you 'd start to think that all cash users are either criminals , tax evaders or terrorists . 
  sure , some use cash to evade tax , but it 's paltry compared to the tax avoidance schemes google and facebook have employed . 
  google does n't use cash to avoid tax . 
  it 's all done via legislative means . 
  coming from greece i can tell you that yes , people tax-evading on a large scale is a societal problem . 
  its not trivial . 
  people like the citizens of greece need to understand that their financial decisions affect others . 
  like if you decide to not pay taxes , that has a very real impact on other people who * do * pay taxes and depend on the governmental services that are funded with said taxes . 
  so the idea that we should be `` hands off '' when it comes to tax evasion is a strange one imho . 
  wikipedia offers a nice summary :  in the 1985 white paper on completion of the internal market , the european commission stressed that the absence of border checks must not provide an incentive to buy arms in countries with less strict legislation . 
  this goal was to be reached by approximation of the countries ' national legislation . 
  [ 70 ] it makes sense , as i said , if people have freedom of movement , criminals have it too , so its easier for them to smuggle or sell illegal firearms . 
  hence this legislation . 
  also , citizens keeping guns for personal use is not `` security policy '' i 'm afraid . 
  its a pretty strange reason to hate the eu . 
  how much does this affect your life ? 
  is an ar-15 worth quitting the eu ? 
  is it that important for you ? 
  i get that guns are cool but you are throwing the baby out with the bathwater here . 
  yeah they were not illegal , but when push came to shove , the us government made being a communist a practical impossibility . 
  your personal and professional life was destroyed if you were suspect of being `` unamerican '' during the cold war . 
  fbi agents deeply infiltrated the cpusa ( more than 10 % of its members were fbi agents , the ddr would be proud ) . 
  so yeah when it mattered , when there was an alternate systemic choice on the table , you were absolutely not free to chose it . 
  your government simply stepped in and prevented people from partaking in that ideology ( conservatives are proud of this too , which is ironic ) . 
  but keep telling yourself how free your speech is .

  it 's not about white vs black , although a lot of people seem to vigorously want to make it that . 
  it 's about quotas existing to begin with . 
  people should be rewarded and hired for how hard they work , not for who they are . 
   check out the database and see for yourself if it helps having a presenter who 's grown up in the area talk about it . 
  they do n't hire a new presenter for every show so your example is not apt . 
  the fact that they have a quota to begin with is a problem . 
   media right now is around 50 % non white in a lot of universities ( certainly in oxbridge ) i do n't think there would be more white people on the bbc if there were no attempts to be proportional usually it tends to be that `` proportional '' means , hire non-white non-male and nobody cares about how many white ones you have . 
  wo n't you be better set for making documentaries and radio shows if your workforce is better experienced in that sort of thing by being better at that job ? 
  if you want a documentary about a tribe in the amazon you 're going to hire an anthropology professor who has the spent the past 10 years studying said tribe . 
  you 're not going to hire a tribesperson for that . 
  that 's the thing , how does having an employee from x area or of x demographic make the output of the bbc better as opposed to just hiring someone who 's flat out more experienced and better at the job ? 
  even at the expense of hiring people who are better qualified for the job ? 
  i thought it 's obligation was to provide news and entertainment . 
  how does representing the entire nation demographically make it better at it 's job ? 
  please , their retarded plan to ban encryption is impossible to actually accomplish even if they had a full majority . 
  did n't the conservative party lose a lot of seats in this election with labor gaining even more ? 
  was n't there a bbc comedian that was sacked for being white and male ? 
  there 's a difference between having liberal politics and creating hiring quotas . 
  so , it 's the moderates that are pushing all the forced equity programs ? 
  the guy with the bucket for a head was a candidate ? 
  context ? 
  no , it 's the * current year \u2122 * and nothing about the virtue signaling behaviour has changed except that it 's intensified . 
  no , it 's almost always used like that , because virtue signalling has become increasingly more and more common as time goes by with the left trying to pander to every single demographic that 's under the impression it 's oppressed . 
   `` virtue-signalling '' is a term used by people that have lower morals than others and know it . 
  no , it 's not . 
  virtue signalling is a term used by people who want to show that the motivation someone else has to do or say something is purely to jerk their own intellectual morality regardless of how valid/helpful/true it may or may not be . 
  islam has literally nothing to do with islam . 
  imaginationland . 
  wait a minute . 
  is this where the mayor came from ? 
  are you really going to compare that to beheading them , stoning them to death and throwing them off roofs ? 
  also , keep in mind , those ^ are n't isolated incidents , it 's common practice across the middle east . 
  where did you pull all that out of `` i would trust muslims to do work for me . 
  what 's with the grey marks in russia and sweeden ? 
  putin has kids ? 
  i do n't know why , but i never imagined that . 
  to be fair , it 's been a very long time since christians last beheaded a homosexual . 
  or threw one off a roof . 
  or stoned one to death . 
  is there something sinister about the muslim comment i 'm missing ? 
  we 've been hearing that for about a year now . 
  i 'm confused , did n't the conservatives win ? 
  i 'm confused , did n't the conservatives win ? 
  do n't you have a tumblr blog to on and complain about how oppressed you are ? 
  we 've upgraded . 
  we 're now at : if tumblr was a person . 
  you should take an anatomy class sometime . 
  if buzzfeed was a person . 
  this belongs in r/cringe or r/cringeanarchy . 
  i get the sentiment behind the image with the kid who tried to save people from the terrorists . 
  but out of context it 's very very very cringe . 
  even with context it 's a bit cringe . 
  that is a very fucking weird graph . 
   you just keep repeating yourself . 
  if your parent , the person most responsible for your upbringing intoxicates your mind with harmful thoughts , which are due to having been brought up in a shithole , you are more prone to being an idiot and blowing yourself up . 
  the only problematic muslims i have ever seen were those first or second generation immigrants from shithole countries . 
  muslims which converted or from a place which is stable are just like the rest of the society here in germany . 
  i would not know about greece , but at least in my community that is the image i get . 
  can i ask what is the thought process you imagine these people have ? 
  you 're treating them like they 're easily influenced idiots with the inability to think for themselves when they 're not . 
  like , what exactly is the thought process behind : `` my old home is a warn torn shithole . 
  so , i better blow up my new home that has done it 's best to accommodate help and educate me . '' ? 
   edit : an example would be the black community in the us . 
  the poor regions of the us are some of the most criminal places in the world , where black people are more criminal and violent on average . 
  yet we also have a ton of black people , brought up in better places , who are some of the most well-educated and rational people ever . 
  black culture is not the reason the people down there are so criminal and violent , the circumstances are . 
  being black is n't an ideology though . 
  yes . 
  and these people also grow up in a secular peaceful and stable society that provides them with proper education and does it 's best to accommodate them . 
  and despite all those , they still decide to murder people in the name of their religion . 
  like what more do you want ? 
  at what point do you start seeing that maybe the ideology itself has something to do with their choice to murder people in the name of their idelogy ? 
  these people have never been to that country . 
  they have never seen that destruction . 
  they grow up in a secular , stable society that provides them with education that does it 's best to accommodate them . 
  and yet despite all that , because of a connection to an ancestral home they 've never even been to , they decide to go and kill a bunch of innocents in the name of allah ? 
  how many excuses do we have to make before we admit there 's a problem with the ideology itself ? 
  so , why are there so many terror attacks by second generation muslims ? 
  almost all terrorsts are second generation of immigrant parents , which means they grew up in peaceful and stable society and yet despite that , they still decided to commit terror in the name of that religion . 
  it 's creating a protected ideology . 
  why exactly does an ideology warrant protection ? 
  you do n't think there are genuine problems with islam that should be criticized ? 
  so , you do n't think m-103 is in any way troubling for the implications it sets ? 
  nor do you find a problem with all the other motions ? 
  oh my fucking god . 
  do you not see the problem with the motion ? 
  do you think it 's completely harmless and sets no bad president ? 
  yes , but how people innately behave on their own , is not . 
  and what do you mean exactly `` even if that were true '' ? 
  yes , that 's the thing , it 's not . 
  behaviors and preferences are biologically innate for the sexes , and there are studies to prove that . 
  yes , the thing is if that is a social construct , why is it uniform across the entire world and observable in children less than a day old ? 
  all the evidence points out that it 's biologically inherent . 
   ( although the other poster pointed out to you that it by no means is ) yes , it is . 
  a couple of cultures having some kind of professions or positions does not change that , because those are acquired , not inherent . 
  `` random shit '' ? 
  you call this random shit ? 
  you do n't think that creating laws in an effort to create a protected religion is a pretty big fucking deal for the president it sets ? 
  yes , because singling out a specific religion and trying to turn it into a protected group by `` adressing x-phobia '' is definitely something completely innocent that has nothing to do with blasphemy laws or freedom to criticize . 
  good thing `` phobia '' is such a well defined term that is impossible to stretch and apply on everything you want eh ?

  wtf !, 
  where the fuck did you see greece asking money from bulgaria or romania ? 
  why do n't you get your head out of your arse ? 
  you are only seeing shit there . 
  it is . 
  and everyone knows it . 
  and it was pointed out ad infinitum . 
  and out of proportions too . 
  to an extend that it makes it much larger that is really is . 
  it 's called circle_jerk after the zillionth time . 
  honestly nuking us would be a more humane alternative . 
  well see the original comment . 
  hardly a joke . 
  just a jump to the cliches bashing train . 
  tis the sign of the times i guess , everyone 's a critic not because they stand on solid ground or have something useful to say ... but only because they have an asshole . 
  now that 's a very shallow remark is n't it ? 
  that `` they democratically voted hence they are responsible for everything '' mantra is unacceptably wrong . 
  1st of all we were forced to do some things by the troika . 
  wrong things as it is already proven . 
  2nd voting for a government is n't a carte blanche for all that governments actions . 
  you should know that . 
  you 'd be amazed to find it is not the case . 
  for instance the russians made a bid to buy the railways and that was block under pressure for the eu even when it was them that forced the privatization of the railways . 
  greece wo n't move into the `` russian / chinese geopolitical sphere '' . 
  make no mistake about it . 
  doing business with them is one think , getting under their influence is another and no one wants that . 
  it is more likely that greece as gets isolated in the eu will move further into the us geopolitical sphere . 
  even syriza is pro american and pro nato . 
  in fact they 've already proposed that the main us base in crete should expand to another ( karpathos ) island too . 
  in fact when it comes to varoufakis sometimes it is rather difficult not to make jokes . 
  the guy might have a few points but he 's certainly a clown . 
  god ... we missed the chance to ged rid of that clown . 
  he 'll continue with great confidence to ruin my country ... 
  i was being sarcastic to / r/pier _ from_rieti for having the nerve to make ironic comments when he comes from the most corrupt country in europe . 
  by far the most corrupt and on a whole different level . 
  greece , italy : rank 69 albania : rank 110 http://www.transparency.org/cpi2014/results, 
  i know well how to pay my taxes and i am doing so . 
  thank you . 
  it 's quite a joke though for you to make snide remarks coming from a country with far more corruption . 
  hardly in a position to give advice to anyone do n't you think ? 
  greece , italy : rank 69 albania : rank 110 http://www.transparency.org/cpi2014/results, 
  true !, 
  any hints on paying taxes from your country ? 
  which means ? 
  hardly a mob attack this one . 
  huh ? 
  koreans , japanese and chinese getting attacked in greece ? 
  what the hell are you talking about ? 
  source please . 
  indeed they are . 
  they always have been so !, 
  check his username !, 
  pedos need to be shot !, 
  ... should always take `` precautionary measures '' everywhere . 
  especially in poor places . 
  so if greece is to be left out of the eu , what about the borders of croatia ? 
  serbia ( is n't in the eu ) , ukraine , russia , belarus ? 
  in all fairness the eu doesnt seem more concerned bout it too . 
  everyone is looking for its countries interest in that matter too . 
  see what happened about quotas . 
  also would you care to see how long a wall should be ? 
  3,145 kms might be short . 
  and where do you put it ? 
  eu 's borders are not a straight line as the us-mexico border is ... 
  you should n't feel responsible for other people 's actions . 
  there are crooks and murderers in every country . 
  you should . 
  well it did n't seem to do anything for the americans and they do have the technology . 
  and where exactly would a wall be built ? 
  even the great wall in china historically made little difference . 
  it 's not the lack of border controls that lead immigrants from the se to the north . 
  quite the contrary . 
  because of the dublin ii accord once they enter in the country we stop them to go to another eu country . 
  i would expect that if we are no longer bind by that accord then they will be freed to leave the country . 
  i hope it wo n't get to this . 
  i 've already answered `` papakonstantinou 's bollocks to cover up his shit . '', 
  does n't need for one to even ask this . 
  ffs how can anyone believe that shit ? 
  can anyone believe that every time there was elections here the tax office burned their books so taxes would n't be collected ? 
  btw taxes are not collected no one comes to your door asking for them . 
  they send you a bill - electronically - and a date before which you have to pay . 
  if you do n't then the consequences are pretty much automated . 
  you ca n't do anything as you would n't have a certificate about not owing taxes , which is needed by law for every transaction imaginable . 
  bollocks of the highest order covered up with bullshit . 
  is that a clear enough answer ? 
  just because something is written in a book doesnt make it reality . 
  have n't read that one but judging by this : ** `` icelanders wanted to stop fishing and become investment bankers . 
  the greeks wanted to turn their country into a pinata stuffed with cash and allow as many citizens as possible to take a whack at it . 
  the germans wanted to be even more german ; the irish wanted to stop being irish . 
  '' ** it certainly is simplistic crap aimed at the `` angry '' `` common sense '' readers who want their emotions justified rather than digg deeper . 
  papakonstantinou 's bollocks to cover up his shit . 
  the guy would be a joke had he not caused so much destruction with his actions and lies . 
  btw the guy is under judicial investigations for covering up his relatives tax evasion . 
  very often you 'll hear the most inspiring words from people that secretly do the opposite . 
  this is how propaganda makes people go blind : he is 77 years old . 
  http://news.yahoo.com/crying-greek-pensioner-story-behind-poignant-photo-003339650.html if i were in your shoes i 'd worry for myself and cry harder than this grandpa . 
  i tried to write that post in a humorous way . 
  i do n't share syriza 's logic on the matter and personally i 'm gon na vote for yes . 
  having said that , i lost any trust to what the imf says , years ago . 
  it is known that from the very start many inside the imf disagreed on the imf proposals exactly for that reason : that the proposed programs would not be viable and that they 'd save private banks and not greece .

  well , this is the balkans , are you trying to make sense of anything ? 
  :p however , there are two real reasons for greek concern on this issue : 1 . 
  fyrom steals cultural heritage that belongs to greece and tries to benefit of this economically via tourism . 
  tourism is the only real export of greece that 's left and we have to protect it . 
  there are maps like [ this ] ( http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_il3c_pahgz0/sabd0t5wdci/aaaaaaaaauq/qlt6pcxlbwq/s400/agencies+++++++++++++++++++1ftheusa%5b1%5d_page_-393491992.jpg ) all over the `` macedonian '' national web pages on the internet . 
  what are they trying to achieve and why should we let them do it ? 
  well , i 'm happy that we both see where each-other is coming from . 
  certainly the problem can not be just in the head but certainly the problem can not be paid just by the bottom . 
  one of my wishes for this situation is that it might actually do us good and let us understand the word `` sustainability '' . 
  ( funny enough , i can not think of the greek equivalent for this word , regardless of how rich the language is ... but that must probably be just me ) by the way , the tax-free limit used to be 12k but the first bracket after that was 25 % . 
  these have all changed by now , of course . 
  tl ; dr : maybe i should have said `` the upper class '' than `` the 1 % '' first , let me apologise that i do not have time to read all your arguments but i 'll try and focus on your links . 
  secondly , let me try to defuse the situation first : http://9gag.com/gag/2681884 [ ps : i 'm not this guy ] note it says it clearly : do n't trust the media back to your links : [ 1 ] . 
  we do not have a functioning state because the politicians were employing incompetent people in exchange of votes . 
  yes , none of these incompetent people ever complained before the crisis and that is indeed our fault . 
  i wonder how can somebody estimate the `` shadow '' economy but anyway , that figure surely includes economic activity conducted by immigrants . 
  ( not that i mind them , i 'm just noticing it ) also not that the figure for the us is 9 % so it 's either there are three times more criminals in gr than the us or the authorities in the us are three times more effective than in gr . 
  now , go back to square one : incompetent public workers are employed in exchange of votes . 
  [ 3 ] oh dear , this argument again . 
  ok , let 's start by the article . 
  it says :  more than six in 10 taxpayers earn less than 12,000 euros per year and are not required to pay income taxes under the greek tax system . 
  so , i hope you do n't mean that the lowest incomes should pay taxes and i move on arguing ; it is impossible to tax-evade in greece if you are a salaried employee in a legally-operating company . 
  yes there are many companies who do n't operate legally but these are mainly smes , shops and cafes - low pay jobs - and they operate without registering or insuring their employees . 
  as you would imagine , people working there really need their job and they can not complain about the situation . 
  so , whose fault is that ? 
  the average person 's or the richer boss ? 
  another popular way to tax-evade is to own and rent property , while not declaring the income . 
  in this case the tenant is at fault for not reporting it but if they do they 'll probably be kicked off soon . 
  however , it 's not the tenant who is tax-evading so they are not in this statistic . 
  the person who is tax-evading is a certainly above average multiple property-owner who is not declaring their income . 
  so , 6/10 are tax evading . 
  how many of them can do something about it without losing their job or their tenancy and how many of them are rich compared to how many are average ? 
  my guess is : very few of the average population tax evades . 
  i appreciate that these property and sme owners are not 1 % but they are certainly above average . 
  another popular-in-the-media method to fish this statistic is by looking at the legal definition of `` tax evasion '' in greece . 
  did you know that * every * foreign tourist who has visited greece has tax-evaded ? 
  that is because : buying something without asking for a receipt is , legally , tax-evasion . 
  some media outlets took this statistic and declared greeks as tax-evaders . 
  now , let me dwell on this issue for a bit more : i strongly believe that in every large enough group of people there is a percentage of them who are criminals . 
  that percentage can not deviate too much from a bell curve . 
  therefore it is just absurd to think that 60 % of greeks are tax-evaders while it 's only 1-10 % in other countries . 
  it just happened that the media targeted greece as tax evasion heaven but what would have happened if they hard targeted the uk as a social benefit paradise or germany as a bribe-owned country ? 
  i 'll let you guess . 
  [ 4 ] we have almost no in-job or job-seeker benefits compared to other countries . 
  the worker 's rights and benefits are almost always related with retirement age and pension value . 
  yes , we 're treated better than in other countries after we retire , but we 're much worse while actively in a career . 
  also , these are measures pushed , again , by the politicians and the union leaders who keep paralysing the country with illegal strikes . 
  ( by the way , union leaders are definitely rich and highly political as well ) [ 5 ] of course , there is 30 % unemployment in greece and 50 % for the young . 
  what did you expect if there is no growth ? 
  also , like in every other european country , we have serious problems managing the ageing population but because of the hardships of the last 30-40 years we do n't have enough workers ( then children ) to cover it up . 
  this is the result of a very complicated process , it 's not fair to just flash it to me !, 
  [ 7 ] again , corruption is done by the rich . 
  why ? 
  because they get rich through corruption and they stay rich and corrupted , high-ranking public employees . 
  but again though , these are not 1 % , certainly not average though . 
  my 1 % rant was mostly against politicians and those who benefit from greece being a sleeping nation . 
  - many eu countries lied in regards with their budget deficit , inc germany and france - greece had no bank debt , only government debt which we had no problem paying until the big boys destroyed the economy . 
  the crisis effectively started in [ 2008 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/northern_rock#subprime_mortgage_crisis_and_nationalisation ) and we were almost unaffected until late 2009 , when a private company decided to downgrade us , based on their metrics - not the eu metrics . 
  - in the meantime , greece had taken care of the eu border using our military and our resources and with no help from the eu partners for the last 30 years . 
  where is the credit for that ? 
  if you seriously believe that the country producing 2 % of total eu gdp can be responsible for * all * these consequences , then i can only say that it 's like blaming the dog for the break up of your marriage . 
  i could go on for ever but in the meantime please watch [ this ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppjw01lerrk ) to see the other side of the coin . 
  so , greece was a disaster for the eu ? 
  nice ... 
   these proposals only adds to the growing already very big list of reasons why 'd we 'd be better off out the eu !!, 
  acta is international and many commonwealth nations ( in canada and australia ) have already signed it . 
  by assumption , if the uk was no in eu , they would have probably already signed it . 
  funny how he tries to frame everything under his agenda , even if there is no substance behind his claim . 
  he wrote to a man , who forwarded to a woman , who replied . 
   independence , or self determination is a worthy goal of it 's own . 
  of course , nobody said this is not important and a right for everyone . 
  i 'm just thinking what is the value of actually being `` declared '' independent compared to be independent in most practical matters but officially in a union . 
  also , both nations live in the same island . 
  independent or not , scotland * will * be dependent to the uk in various ways ( mostly economic dependency ) . 
  finally , do n't forget that national security is very expensive . 
  very very expensive . 
  fair point but there is a difference between seeking independence from invaders than breaking a partnership . 
  i consider the uk a partnership . 
  if you do n't like the rules of the partnership then you might go ahead and re-negotiate but independence would be unnecessary . 
  after all , both scotland and the remaining uk union would be members of both the eu and the commonwealth ( probably ) and therefore there will be a lot of common legal framework , free trade , freedom of migration etc. 
  what will scotland gain that can not be gained via other options ? 
  ( i.e. 
  as an external observer ( i 'm a foreigner who lived in the uk for 12 years , 6 in scotland and 6 in england ) , i feel the urge to warn both nations that independence is a mistake . 
  this is not a time for `` divide '' because somebody else ( europe ? ), 
  will `` conquer '' upon you ( both ) . 
  if it was the boom years , where mistakes would have a smaller impact in everyday lives then we could discuss it . 
  i think the netherlands have a similar system . 
  i have been saying this on reddit ( in other subreddits ) for years now and i 've been downvoted like hell all the time . 
  i was told things like `` greeks retire early because hairdressers retire at 45 . '', 
  even this very nice article only has 10 upvotes , nobody will ever know , everybody is poisoned by the popular media which they otherwise hate . 
  i do n't know how accurate this is , but that is a lot of potential poverty !, 
  which kinda improves my argument . 
  there is less diversity but still people like to define their origin better , when it matters . 
  i think every ethnicity thinks they are better than the other ethnicities :p, 
  hello there , i 'm greek . 
  i just want to point out that after reading the bail-out conditions , it does not feel like my country is sovereign any more . 
  i do n't mind the nationality , it is ethnicity that matters and you wo n't give this up . 
  are n't us americans able to claim that they are texan or new yorker etc ? 
  is n't their state of origin a legitimate question to a newly met person in the us ? 
  are n't scottish proud of being scottish and living in the uk ?

   there 's a difference between defending an allied nation and defending an imploding second world country 's citizens with those citizens throwing grenades at you and while receiving no supplies or air support . 
  if you consider an ` imploding second world country 's citizens '' not worth fighting for cause they 're not citizens of as an illustrious country as yous , you should n't be in this war in the first place and you deserve to get trialed . 
  til soldiers are allowed to decide what 's needless and not and act ignoring the orders issued to them . 
  literally every last stand in history apparently is stupid to you because the soldiers may have deemed it `` pointless '' . 
  the 300 spartans and co. in thermopylae could have said `` fuck that we ca n't stop 200.000 persians , it 'll just add to the death toll '' , but instead they helped a lot in winning the war by standing their ground and eventually dying . 
  like / u/rulweylan said , this is what a respectable military unit does . 
  it follows orders ( unless they 're illegal ) . 
  if you 're told to defend civilians and instead you hand them over and surrender to get away with your life , expect to be called a pussy . 
  yes the civilians might have died anyway but you do n't know that unless you fight for them . 
  if you simply hand them over to the enemy you know for sure what their fate will be . 
  i like how spot on the word `` re-erect '' is for the situation . 
  to be fair erdogan has kind of pulled a 360 ( for the worse ) in recent years so this is n't helpful . 
  not saying that if it was someone else in charge instead it 'd solve the problem obviously but perhaps it would have been a bit easier . 
  that jousting tournament is fucking badass !, 
  i want to go there so bad right now . 
  i do n't care as long as it has beers and blondies . 
  * rage intensifies *, 
  honestly , as bad and immoral as it sounds , everyone with that capability is spying on everyone like you said . 
  that 's how it works . 
  the rest is just politics `` oh you spy on me !, 
  how could you ? 
  we 're allies !! '', 
  he means that the usa is the world police and they 're allowed to spy on you but you ca n't spy on them cause * matt damon *, 
  did we lose crete and i missed the memo ? 
  yes that makes everything better . 
  `` do n't look muslim and you 'll be fine , otherwise you deserve to be attacked '' . 
  i like my beard !, 
  or you know . . it sounds like a place where you can walk down the street and get assaulted for `` looking muslim '' . 
  this is a bump after a long time but i had to say this is a spot on description , at least based on how i see the situation of the time . 
  greece was n't really in danger of being part of the eastern block since stalin had already `` abandoned '' it to the west sphere of influence . 
  it could have been communist but not ussr communist . 
  would things have been better or worse ? 
  hard to tell for sure . 
  but i believe that a country has the right to explore that possibility and decide which path to take itself , something that the british denied greece at that time by force of arms . 
  the key points are : a ) like you said eam was definitely leftist but it was not hardcore communist in its majority . 
  even many right-wing people sided with them because they saw what eam did for greece during the occupation , and the alternative was far from saints as well . 
  b ) eam was n't anti-west , it was anti-western meddling as you pointed out about the king . 
  they had every desire to work with the allies like they did during the occupation but they would n't trade one occupation with another ( british ) , nor would they want to reinstall monarchy . 
  the greeks were free to decide what to do with their country and for better or worse the majority was pro-eam , yet the british could n't let greece slip to communism so they intervened and actually supported the nazi collaborators , the very same people they had been fighting during the occupation , and turned against their former allies of eam . 
  c ) eam never sought to stop the british when it could . 
  they could have marched into athens and secured it before the british arrived and the british would have a really tough time fighting them there , yet the eam stood and let the british enter athens not seeking confrontation . 
  even churchill could n't believe it . 
  it 's a largely unknown story but to many greeks this was a betrayal by the uk . 
  many will argue that it turned out better this way cause greece avoided communism but the ends do n't always justify the means and when another country forcefully dictates what kind of government you 'll have , it 's just always crappy . 
  also thanks for the recommendation of the book , i 'll definitely give it a try . 
  not saying that the greek side was n't largely at fault for the shit that was stirred in the island ( it was a junta anyway ) , but turkey 's intentions were clear . 
  if intervention and peacekeeping was their goal , they would have stopped when the ceasefire was signed . 
  instead they violated the ceasefire and went from occupying 3 % of the island to occupying almost half of it and they brought in settlers from mainland turkey which is a violation of the geneva convention , to solidify the illegal occupation of the island . 
  intervention was the motive or the excuse , it was n't their goal . 
  occupation was . 
  both sides were at fault . 
  the difference is that turkey 's `` wrong '' is more . . permanent ? 
  hopefully a good solution will be found soon . 
  lol what 's wth the downvotes ? 
  do people think that it 's only one side 's fault or something ? 
  popular destination for russians too . 
  i was there during my military service and there were a shitload of russians in limassol . 
  the brits were mostly in larnaca . 
  i always thought it was ghosts but you can never know with those anti-videogames retards . 
  lol @ the suspected anti-muslim agenda in pacman though . 
   when istanbul was occupied after the ww1 , christians ( both local and foreigners ) flocked to hagia sophia , trying to pray inside . 
  again and again they got permissions and support from british and pressured ottoman administration . 
  they did this despite it being clear that it was a mosque and the imperial mosque at that . 
  they came to our lands and spit on our face ( figuratively ) . 
  funny . . the exact same sentence can be said about when the ottomans occupied or captured constantinople . 
  it was a church and you came to our lands and took em and spat in our faces by making it a mosque . 
  see how it can be used both ways ? 
  if you 're basing your whole argument on `` they did it too first '' , you 're wrong cause you did it first . 
  regardless , like i 've mentioned before , both are wrong the way i see it . 
  turning a church into a mosque or a mosque into a church are both shitty and petty . 
   they were simply destroyed outright or left to disrepair ( for much of ottoman heritage in balkans , leaving it is same as destroying them ) . 
  a lot of old small churches are left abandoned and without repairs as well . 
  there 's a shitload of them sometimes it 's not possible to restore them all . 
  there are many more important and bigger mosques that are being preserved in many countries however . 
  that 's not a justification for what turkey is doing . 
  not repairing a mosque is nowhere near as insulting or provoking as converting it into a worship site for a different religion ( considering it 's being done out of spite like you 've admitted ) . 
   we can also preserve it as a mosque and my people can go and feel the same things as their ancestors did . 
  this is the problem with you people . 
  you 're talking about how preserving it as a moque is right cause of your ancestors as if you built the place . 
  you merely found it there , it already existed almost 1000 years before it was `` yours '' so your argument is hollow . 
  it was basically a church for way longer than it was/is a mosque . 
  your ancestors used to pray there and other ancestors used to pray when it was a church ( and for longer ) . 
   taking it and turning it into a zoo ( not much different ) lol museums respect and protect their displays . 
  your ancestors destroyed much of the iconography in the church because it was christian . 
  talk about a zoo eh ? 
   culture is something that lives , and continuing traditions for centuries while keeping to their original meaning is the thing we should do . 
  ironic . 
  its original purpose was being a church . 
   i wo n't say we cared about your heritage , we did n't . 
  for us it was same as any building . 
  and that explosion also caused deaths of hundreds of people but i guess it was our fault for using `` gunpowder storage '' . 
  i can understand that it was negligence but it was certainly not on purpose . 
  actually yes it was on purpose . 
  how do you `` accidentally '' store gunpowder in an ancient temple ? 
  it was done to prevent the venetians from bombarding athens . 
  that you do n't care about culture is evident . 
   i thought it was about history and culture but as you clearly show it is about symbolism . 
  those `` random irrelevant '' mosques are part of our history and they are the `` history and culture '' of turkish people . 
  funny how you disregard them because of their size . 
  it 's not symbolic it 's a simple matter of monumanets comparisson .

  the tap , the biggest pipeline will connect the eu to the massive gas fields of azerbaijan 's caspian fields . 
  the caspian fields of azerbaijan will easily provide up to 15-20 % of all eu 's gas needs on its own with the tap pipeline which is being built across the entirety of northern greece to feed eu its energy needs . 
  the second major pipeline is the eastern mediterreanean pipeline which will bring gas from the leviathian basin of cyprus/israel to eu through greece . 
  the leviathian gas field is estimated to provide around 10-15 % of all gas needs . 
  now greece itself has enough gas within its own waters to provide up to 10-15 % of gas needs potentially . 
  so the combination of the pipelines + greek gas fields could one day equal up to 50 % . 
  but even if its 25-30 % it will still be a game-changer . 
  well communism was meant to be a `` utopia '' where all people live equally wealthy with an extremely high living standard . 
  at leas the theory portrayed it that way . 
  it is possible that science advances to the point where scarcity is no longer an issue and everyone can live with a high living standard . 
  soviet communism was a fascist state with a capitalist black market that accounted for nearly 50 + % of trade in soviet times . 
  they are the `` rebels '' not terrorists . 
  when uk/usa supports them they are always rebels . 
  same way poroshenko is a tycoon and not an oligarch . 
  monsanto/gmo/etc 100 % banned in greece - also we do not important cheap/gmo products from other countries than put a greek sticker on it and ship it off like some other countries , such as this example [ greek beekeepers become latest casualty of european gm labelling war ] ( http://www.thepressproject.net/article/54934/greek-beekeepers-become-latest-casualty-of-european-gm-labelling-war )  however the recent european parliament vote on the issue of honey labelling has been described as a setback for greece 's beekeepers , favouring german companies importing large quantities of cheaper , lower quality honey from countries outside the european union such as canada and china . 
    `` it puts us at a competitive disadvantage , '' ms karatasou said . 
  `` the advantage of greek honey is that about 90 % of it comes from natural ecosystems in non-cultivated land from beekeepers who move their bees from place to place . 
  this means that the quality is exceptional but we can not compete on price with the large honey producers . 
  labelling allows consumers to choose quality . '' all greek honey is by default gmo free given that gm crops are prohibited from being grown in the country . 
  vegan propagandists apparently, 
  soviet union was to communism what democratic peoples republic of korea ( north korea ) is to democracy, 
  the eu will never fail as long as germany stays in it , and germans are possibly the most pro-eu nation next to belgium, 
  greece has 10 % extremists with golden dawn syriza although idiots are not extremists, 
  hollande should not be allowed to manage a mcdonalds . 
  let alone a country like france, 
  1st , i have absolutely no issues with fyrom calling themselves whatever the hell they want . 
  my main issue is that the propaganda education in fyrom teaches fyrom children that greeks are evil `` history thieves '' , they are enemies of fyrom and fyrom ` ians are the true macedonian blood !, 
  this is non-sense since macedonia ceased to exist in 148 bc . 
  no modern greeks say `` we are 100 % spartan ! , or 100 % athenian ! , or 100 % macedonian ! '', 
  because it is non-sense . 
  all these greek cities mixed together during byzantine times to create the modern greek person who is a mix of all the greek city-states . 
  also , fyrom territory does not contain even 1 % of the land of the ancient kingdom of makedonia . 
  again i have no issue with what they call themselves , but i just wnated to point that out . 
  and lastly . 
  they can not enter nato or eu because greece will veto every single time . 
  they are a mico-state whose entire economy depends on greek shipping ports which they are lucky to get access too and enjoy . 
  an agressive nation who spits on greek history will never enter the eu as long as greece is a member . 
  we have veto power and we will use it until this `` fyrom '' ceases to exist . 
  which will happen latest around 2040-2050 in the upcoming albania vs fyrom war that is brewing up . 
  i doubt it, 
  well said , treating immigration as a racism test is what caused this rise in far-right in europe, 
  it is . 
  but this wo n't stop israeli media portraying every single citizen of germany today as flag-waving radical nazi 's . 
  german-israel relations are going to get interesting with this bit of news , it is obviously insignificant but it will be blown out of epic proportions . 
  it is now within the realm of possibility that uk and france will leave the eu . 
  i still do not think the eu will completely dissolve without both countries as germany seems intent on keeping it together , but the future of the eu seems very very uncertain at this moment . 
  the trillion dollar gas fund is sometimes called `` social security fund '' , at least in certain articles . 
  i know this is not the same as the pensioner fund . 
  eu parliament is going to get alot more entertaining with front national/ukip/syriza being major players now . 
  maybe this is the kick in the ass pro-eu parties needed to really get to work and put in reforms . 
  most people in the 1980 's even 90 's thought the idea of norway being a gas producing country were not only delusional but insane . 
  now it provides around 40 + % of their gdp and they have 1 trillion $ in a social security fund with no end in sight . 
  samaras signed a law in early 2014 that made it so all gas profits will be split up with 10 % going into greek scientific research projects and 90 % going into norweigan style social security fund ( samaras hired same norway team who created theirs ) i bet you will still curse out samaras for whatever insane reason you have . 
  do you honestly think your useful idiot hero tsipras would do that ? 
  he would steal all the money like his pasok masters and sponsors and create a failed state . 
  greece is positioning itself to be the main energy pillar of the eu by 2020-2025 . 
  the two major ( and one minor ) pipelines currently in devlopment are tap and emp with the minor being the interconnector greece-bulgaria ( igb ) the tap which will be complete by 2018-2020 will bring gas from azerbaijan and could provide up to 15-20 % of all europes gas needs for nearly a century . 
  the emp pipeline will bring gas from the leviathian gas basin of israel/cyprus and will provide around 10-15 % of eu 's gas needs for just as long . 
  those two things alone will greatly help greece as greece currently spends around 8-10 % of total gdp to import over-priced gas/oil from mainly russia , so this will free up to 4-5 % of gdp . 
  the real hope for me though is greece 's potential for its own gas reserves within greek waters , some estimates put the number anywhere from 5 , 10,15 or even 20 + trillion $ of potential reserves . 
  what little is known so far is that crete alone has around 1 trillion $ minimum of gas around the island alone . 
  . this alone will help pay off debt + boost investment in many sectors of greek economy . 
  the only bad part is that we will have to wait until 2020 to start profiting from this . 
  so next few years will continue to be a bit of a struggle but by 2020 greece will have an economic boom . 
  i did simplify it a bit but you are right . 
  through-out history there has always been `` tribal '' mentality even if not in tribe . 
  for example in greek byzantine era , the tribal mentality of greece was greek-orthodox was civilized and everyone else was a barbarian and an enemy . 
  greek islands are the main reason to go to greece !, 
  although i would dedicate 1-2 days to visit acropolis and the new museum there if you enjoy greek history . 
  if not interested in history then just go straight to islands . 
  i found this german language ad for greece - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thihtipdxxk greek islands are easily the best place in europe to vacation , nothing else like it on earth . 
  thousands of islands each with unique traits , some islands are hardcore party islands , others are laid-back quite destinations for honeymoons and many are a mix of both . 
  endless amounts of things to do and it is very easy to avoid tourist traps and create your own unique vacation, 
  a number of reasons . 
  first and foremost putin calculated that there would be little to no bloodshed from his silent invasion by the `` polite men '' ( slang term for spetnaz who invaded crimea ) . 
  and he was right , only 3 people died in total from this invasion and he captured the entire region nearly overnight . 
  as to why he took crimea , there are a few reason but the major two are that he needed crimea as it was the location of russia 's only warm-water port during winter and in general stored massive amount of russian military and technology and secondly there is estimated to be trillions of $ worth of gas/oil to be taken from crimean waters . 
  so putin calculated risk ( damage to infrastructure and deaths ) was worth potential gains ( military base + gas/oil ), 
  even better , simpler and cheaper . 
  every classrom in eu should have a standard 40-50 inch hd-tv with built in skype . 
  one hour a day every classroom interacts with another classroom somewhere else in the eu and every day it is different . 
  before nationalism , there was certainly tribalism . 
  for example in ancient greece , sparta/athens/macedonia etc were giant tribes known as city-states that were constantly at war with each other . 
  i am sure in scotland during ancient times there were very big tribes that were constantly at war with each other and the same goes for every country . 
  the modern nation is a relatively new concept so nationalism does date back a few hundred years whereas before that it was pure tribalism . 
  because pro-russians feel discriminated and abused ( not my opinion , just giving a reason ) also , i saw a video yesterday of pro-russians destroying the ballot papers while laughing maniacally at the only real choice for prime minister , the chocholate oligarch billionaire poroshenko . 
  it is funny to them that maidan kicked out one corrupt evil oligarch just so they could vote and die for another one . 
  the thing with putin is that you have to read `` in between the lines '' of all his recent actions to fully understand him . 
  he is like a chess grandmaster at geo-politics and each move is incredibly calculated . 
  i will download it when available , just checked and nothing online yet, 
  you can have mussolini 2.0 . 
  just do n't try to invade us again !,

  because israel is the greatest american ally in the middle east and its relationship with iran is at best problematic , with iran attempting to get into the nuclear weapons deal and israel fearing it might lose its military power on the area . 
  that 's why a very strong anti-iranian feeling has been cultivated since the late '70s ( when the pahlavi dynasty was overthrown and ayatollah khomeini took charge of iran ) , making many americans feel like iran is an actual threat . 
  we 're more likely to send a man to jupiter than achieve such a deal in our lifetime . 
  so , biassed it is . 
  that was my point . 
  the nobel prizes will collect submissions for science and literature from all over the world , but their choice for laureates will always tilt towards europe and especially sweden . 
  sweden has also received more nobel prizes in literature than the whole of asia . 
  am i to believe that swedish literature is more lofty than its massively divergent , multi-century developing , highly critically acclaimed asian counterpart ? 
  well , they represent a nation of up to 22 million people ( in turkey alone ) that has systematically been oppressed , denied civil & cultural rights , and even downright massacred by the turkish republic 's government since the country 's establishment . 
  i oppose terrorism in all its forms and certainly do n't believe spilling blood is in any way justified , but you have to admit that many of pkk 's worst actions are at least expected as a reaction to turkey 's iron stance against the kurds . 
  you ca n't kill the tiger 's cubs and be surprised when she bites your neck . 
  sweden ( pop . 
  ~ 10 million ) has received more nobel prizes than all of asia ( pop ~ 4.4 billion ) . 
  the committee is definitely biassed . 
  i mean , it 's only half an hour by car from r\u00f8nne to nex\u00f8 . 
  you can even use a bicycle for such a short distance . 
  i think it 's closer to ` brainwashing ' and ` having-your-cerebral-functions-twisted-enough-to-think-beheading-anyone-you-oppose-is-okay ' , than actual mental illness . 
  it 's a sociopsychological issue . 
  i feel like a new scientific term is needed . 
  getting taller seems to be the most effective way to keep your head above water level . 
  japan , though , is still technically at war with russia . 
  they never signed a peace treaty after wwii because of the kurils dispute , so the two countries are at a 70-year-old stalemate . 
  australia takes immigrants , not refugees . 
  any person arriving illegally in australian waters claiming to be a refugee is sent to refugee camps in manus island and niue waiting for their refugee claim to be processed . 
  if they 're found to not be genuine refugees they are repatriated or sent to another safe country outside australia . 
  if they 're genuine , they are resettled in papua new guinea . 
  basically , australia will only take you in if you can prove you moved to the country to work , provide for yourself , and pay taxes while expecting no benefit from the state . 
  it 's been as such since 2013 . 
  still better than the massive plague outbreak of the 14th century , so ... yeah . 
  that 's sort of a plus ... kinda . 
  yes , unlike previous pontiffs , the current pope is suprisingly cordial and tolerant . 
  how unchristian of him !, 
  you spelled ` horse meat ' wrong . 
  `` turkish justice minister bekir bozdag said anyone who suggests the attempted coup was staged was probably involved in it themselves and would face investigation . '', 
  * facepalm * edit : apparently , an ` appeal to probability ' fallacy and a 5th-grader 's `` he who smelt it , dealt it '' rhetoric is enough to legally persecute someone in modern day turkey . 
  in other news , rain is still wet . 
  are n't arrest warrants supposed to be issued by judges ? 
  were there any judges allowed to keep their office after the purge ? 
   president tayyip erdogan [ ... ] saying it would enable the authorities to act more efficiently to bring those r\u0336e\u0336s\u0336p\u0336o\u0336n\u0336s\u0336i\u0336b\u0336l\u0336e\u0336 opposing him to `` justice '' . 
  sounds about right . 
  in the us , proper id is n't even obligatory for a citizen . 
  lots of americans throw a fit because they are asked to bring an identification document with them when voting . 
  crazy stuff !, 
  he also does n't have a strong footing in `` protecting '' turkish people outside turkey and use that as an excuse the same way putin did with crimea . 
  putin , though , had a semi-logical reason to do it . 
  crimea 's population is over 2/3 ethnically russian . 
  erdogan does n't have such an advantage to recreate his empire . 
  ethnic turks do n't constitute the majority on any country outside turkey ; not even a respectable minority . 
  the closest they have is a < 20 % of the population of cyprus , almost all of which is located in the northern self-declared independent part of the island . 
  any attempt at an expansionist war will be seen globally as clearly offensive and without excuse . 
  so ... half of turkey then ? 
  that was an american affair , not a european one . 
   that 's what you get for calling us finish instead of ~ ~ finnish ~ ~ suomaperkelainen  ftfy :p,

  same in russian and belarusian . 
  9 days too late , but i wo n't complain . 
  it could also be because of the latin word for abduction or kidnapping ( ` raptio ' ) being erroneously translated to `` rape '' in english . 
  just look at * the rape of europa * ( sp . 
  * el rapto de europa * ) [ by goya ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/europa_\\ ( mythology \\ ) # / media/file : the_rape_of_europa , _ goya.jpg ) . 
  ` rapto ' is spanish for abduction . 
  same thing with the [ rape of the sabine women ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_rape_of_the_sabine_women ) . 
   apollo is much more dignified and deserving to be the chief god . 
  [ daphne ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/daphne ) would beg to differ . 
   well except the part where two of them are being investigated for fraud ... 
  i consider this a good thing . 
  not the fraud , but that there 's investigation about it . 
  the sign may be too simplistic ( it 's a rally sign , not a thesis ) , but it does have a point . 
  the eu/eec has greatly contributed to the lack of hostilities between its members by bringing economic integration to the forefront and trying to make wars between them obsolete . 
  it was the main reason for its creation and it has succeeded in it so far , bringing us the most peaceful era this continent as a whole has ever experienced . 
  neither country has ever been a member of the eu or eec before it . 
  you mean mike ` short for michael pencil ' pence ? 
  yeah , it 's better ( and cheaper ) to just take the cable car lift . 
  that being said , though , this does n't mean terrorist acts should be trivialized . 
  we should seriously fight against terrorism , but we should also not allow it to consume us ( although this is a fight we 're currently losing ) and give way for government agencies to use it as a weapon against our rights , like the patriot act did . 
  i agree with the first part of your sentence . 
  here 's half an upvote for you !, 
  dude , these people measure their weight in * stones * !, 
  they 're clearly savages !, 
   moreover , it is written that : `` you , who with the ` sweat ' of your hands , ** have contributed to the progress that turkey has achieved ** , can participate in the future of our country . '',

  what is he on about ? 
   time for an european company to step in !, 
  euber to the rescue !, 
  i 'm not saying that we 're right next door and our beaches are better ... but we 're right next door and our beaches are better . 
  i assume that once ~ ~ federalisation ~ ~ greater european integration ensues , the 25th of march ( signature of the treaty of rome ) might become an eu-wide transnational holiday . 
  i 'm personally a bit against it , since that day is already a [ national holiday in my country ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/greek_war_of_independence ) , but we could take one for the team , i guess . 
  there 's always [ this one ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/europe_day ) , though . 
  how much would you say his anti-eu rhetoric affects public opinion ? 
  is the average hungarian citizen pro- or anti-eu ? 
  we all know it was einar ... 
  not only that , but the doctor ( s ) who validated the request and operated the procedure could get themselves in serious legal trouble if it turns out the patient was mentally unstable when they chose to be euthanized . 
  i agree , but i 'd add medical consent after physical and psychological evaluation . 
  it actually owned only a `` tiny '' part of that `` tiny '' outpost . 
  not to mention the whole libya debacle , where france was a leading force . 
  it 's almost as if france is a sovereign nation that chooses whether or not to support a war against another country depending on the estimated benefits it 'll gain from the action/inaction . 
  it technically could be used as casus belli in real life as well , but it should n't and it obviously wo n't . 
  then we 'll be deporting them for being immigrants , not because of the domestic abuse . 
  we ca n't confuse different issues .

  stand and watch ? 
  you choose sunny days to lock yourselves inside a dark room and watch a movie ? 
  i thought sunny days are for lying on the grass , some of you even naked . 
  the cinema is the preferred activity when the weather is shitty and you ca n't sit outside . 
  to your defense i always saw greek as much harder to learn than some european languages - including german and , obviously , english . 
  now it seems pretty obvious , but obviously i was n't thinking when i wrote it !, 
  screaming : ** `` aus dem weg !,

  maybe they have a * secret * secret police and no ones knows about it . 
  i 'm actually an introvert too , but i 'm thinking : what 's the worst that 's going to happen ?

   frankly , i think decisions like this should not be decided by people who have no degree in economics . 
  interestingly enough , plato hold the same view on democracy . 
  he thought people , and especially kings , should be philosophers , and not the average peasant . 
  these secret cia prisons are n't so secret now , eh ? 
  i go sightseeing too , but i 'd rather have stories from locals to tell , than a report of the places i visited . 
  these americans were indeed really extroverted . 
  personally i prefer couchsurfing in order to meet people when i 'm abroad . 
  i hear that brussels does n't have tourist attractions , like paris , athens or rome , but it has a nice lifestyle and easygoing people . 
  which is preferable imo . 
  i 'd rather be going from cafeterias to pubs and meet interesting people , than going from museum to museum with all the cringy stereotypical tourists that try to take stupid selfies . 
  i even know a group of americans that come to athens every year who say that sightseeing is fun , but drinking ouzo with locals is better . 
  edit : clarification, 
  already two firefighters have died in cyprus . 
  greece has sent two cl-415 canadairs and 2 super pumas . 
   brexit might cost the uk its place in mini-europe , a brussels theme park , where european landmarks , including the eiffel tower , the acropolis and mount vesuvius , are recreated in painstaking miniatures ok , that 's the best argument against leaving so far !, 
  and ugly too . 
  if you remove all the ancient monuments and the nice part of the center you are left with millions of big , square , concrete apartment buildings , heavy traffic , pollution and barely any parks . 
  salamis is an island right next to the town in which i live . 
  it is connected to the mainland via a ferry line and they have been `` planning '' for years to build a bridge instead . 
  from what i know the cost-benefit ration is pretty big . 
  that 's why it is n't done yet , this and the fact that you have to go through a hell of bureaucracy and corruption to get a project like that started . 
  edit : last time i checked , they did n't even want to build a bridge , but an underwater tunnel instead . 
  because , you know , normal bridges are too cheap for us !,

  guns do n't . 
  yeah , hold on , let me ring up the black market dealer i got in my phone contacs whose number was given to me by the magic gun fairy the instant i decided to become a mugger . 
  we had a similar argument going into vietnam . 
  the soviets had a similar argument going into afghanistan . 
  the french had a similar argument in vietnam . 
  except those countries were n't defended by gun nuts with the glocks they kept hidden under their pillows , those countries were being supplied military grade weapons and supplies by other countries with special intrests . 
   i do n't have my copy of war in the shadows : the guerrilla in history , but they 've got a long and extensive history of armies walking into occupations thinking `` i could win any straight-up battle that i get into , so i will win the war '' , and then proceeding to lose the war . 
  those invasions failed for 99 reasons and glocks kept under pillows was n't one of them . 
  random citizens that keep a gun in a safe hidden under the floorboards will not repel and army . 
  invasions fail because of bad strategy , terrain , supply problems and guerrila warfare that is almost always armed by an external power that has intrests . 
   the goal of a guerrilla conflict is n't to stand in a line and halt an enemy at the border -- that is the thing that is to be avoided above all . 
  it 's to ensure that any occupation is untenable , to ensure that you alienate rather than befriend the population , and that your support is not accepted . 
  yes , and even guerrilla groups have someone supplying them with real weapons and supplies , usually an external power that has special intrests in stopping the invader . 
  a guerrilla group composed of random dudes with pistols wo n't do jack . 
   guisan 's forces could not have stood up to hitler 's forces in a straight-up fight . 
  if he had sent the swiss army to fight the german one in an all-in fight , he 'd simply have lost , you 're right . 
  that was why he intended to deny germany that fight . 
  it was n't that hitler lacked bombers or howitzers , but that they are n't clearly useful . 
  let 's say that germany marches in . 
  they occupy the swiss cities . 
  now , a week in , a resupply truck coming to supply a german outpost is attacked and the supplies taken . 
  you are the officer in charge of the occupation . 
  what do you do ? 
  do you place more soldiers on the convoys ? 
  you 're steadily dragging in more resources , and your opponent will simply choose to attack something that you are n't strong at . 
  do you make use of collective punishment , violate the geneva convention ? 
  now you 're pissing off more of the population , that-which-outnumbers you . 
  you have to win hearts and minds . 
  sure , your tank may stop a bullet , but nobody 's going to stand and shoot at your soldiers when they 're in tanks . 
  your soldiers have to get out . 
  that 's a very fine hypothetical scenario . 
  except it 's nothing more than that . 
   the us probably does more-or-less all of the stuff that one might suggest as a counter -- have rapidly-available air support for patrols that get attacked . 
  build a huge , protected base for soldiers to stay in . 
  use extensive intelligence . 
  have guarded resupply convoys . 
  and yet , against the far-less-well-armed and far-less-populous groups , there 's still a slog . 
  do you really think the us goverment is planning to enslave it 's citizens and guns are the only thing that can save you ? 
   there are a lot of things in this world that have the potential to kill 10 people in less than 5 seconds , hell there are things we have access to that can kill more in less time . 
  you are going to start banning everything that can kill people in short period of time you will ban everything . 
  my point is that a firearm is a piece of equipment , no inherently good or bad . 
  it is how people use it that determines how a situation unfolds . 
  if someone chooses to misuse a piece of equipment , it is not reasonable to ban said piece of equipment . 
  when terrorists use cars to run down swaths of people the discussion does not turn to the government banning cars so the idea that it is ok to ban firearms because they may be used to kill people is idiotic . 
  the difference between guns and those other things is that guns are by design made to do that . 
  their inherent purpose is to flying pieces of metal at high velocity with the intend to damage vitals and kill the things they hit . 
  a nuke is a tool too with no inherent bad or good , but a nuke 's intended purpose is also to kill . 
   and will not prevent firearms from the hands of criminals or terrorists yeah right , because your everyday mugger has access to the black ties ( in their phone contacts i pressume ) and knows how to get in contant with illegal arms dealers . 
  even terrorists will have trouble actually getting guns . 
  smuggling a gun into a country is not as easy to buying it from an over the top counter . 
   so all this will do is affect law abiding citizens and will not prevent firearms from the hands of criminals . 
  yes . 
  yes it will . 
  there is not some kind of criminal fairy that instantly gives you access to every aspect of the underworld when you decide to be a mugger . 
  you 're acting like terrorists have `` black market '' in their phone contacts . 
  except millitary technology has advanced just a wee tiny bit since world war 1 and 2 . 
  the only thing an armed citizenry would accomplish today is give the army an excuse to kill them as they 'll no longer be non combatants . 
  if you vote democrat you support slavery . 
  you 're acting like we 're not talking about killing machines that have the potential to take 10 lives in less than 5 seconds . 
  itt : muh second amen ... shit . 
  seriously , who the fuck thinks their glock will stop a fascist government or an invading army ? 
  it 's ok if guns make you feel like your dick 's bigger but do n't lie and pretend you want them for a `` noble '' cause . 
  right , this comment is strawman stretch , but the one above it ? 
  completely legit . 
  i see you 're a big fan of the logic : `` it 's okay when we do it , it 's only wrong when the other team does it in response . '', 
  do these stories exist today ? 
  we 're they put into production ? 
  islam is not a race . 
  who is mightier ? 
  le pen , or le sword ? 
  totally . 
  gon na go write about it in my transqueer asexual gender nonconforming otherkin dual system tumblr blog . 
  le pen is stoopid poopoo head . 
  now please rub my cock and comment on how intelligent i am for making that statement . 
  no , the one where potatoes are the incarnation of a latvian goddess . 
  i spent 15 minutes going through my saved comments looking for that one latvia potato goddess copypasta . 
  i could n't find it . 
  i made a joke because the first thing that came i to your mind was the indian flag which is similar to `` it 's cause i 'm black '', 
   it 's because i 'm black is n't it ? 
  i think he 's referring to immigrants from the middle east because le pen is anti immigration while macron is not . 
   what the right says if le pen gets the rich vote : `` all the smart capitalists can see she is good for the economy ! '', 
  i 'm sorry , but i can not imagine anyone uttering this specific quote with a straight face . 
  not about le pen , but any politician in general . 
  so , the poor , needy and in suffering voted le pen , while the rich and well off voted macron . 
  take a hint . 
  i posted this comment twice and both times it got marked as controversial , i honestly do n't know why , it 's a joke/pun from youtube , i thought it was funny . 
  we will soon find out . 
  who is mightier ? 
  le pen or le sword ? 
  you know what ? 
  this is a great idea . 
  but it does not go far enough imo . 
  we should have a full organization dedicated to weeding out fake news . 
  we could call it ... the ministry of truth .

  its decent but all these elected people just want to have power . 
  as for the euro , pretty much the biggest parties want it . 
  as far as i know , syriza , the 2nd biggest party , plans to negotiate the debt by saying : `` we know that the debt is huge.with these actions , we will never be able to pay it . 
  help us by loosening the actions and we will pay . '', 
  personally , it looks more feasible than what the government says . 
  austerity and austerity . 
  strangely how many countries in europe do n't want austerity but we are `` lucky '' to have austerity !, 
  not to forget , almost every day there is a gathering about some wrong government 's choice . 
  also , after the surplus achieved only the police got a 500 euro ( !! ), 
  raise and some homeless people got some money . 
  if i start bashing the current government it wont end :p, 
   where only a few percent of the population were actually allowed to vote . 
  yes , you are right . 
  i dont want only few percent of the population to vote , but the whole population . 
  ( 18 + years old )  yes , so why did you vote for them then ? 
  personally , i did n't vote them . 
  i suppose people voted because they thought , were the least worse than others . 
  also , do n't forget that nd is one of the two parties that brung us in this situation . 
   that is impossible , for several reasons . 
  say that you want higher pensions , lower taxes and retire early . 
  and then you vote no to no more loans ? 
  and , democracy does n't mean that every single thing should be voted on . 
  then people would have to vote every day , not have time to work etc. 
  that is why we have parliaments , so they can vote every day for us . 
  it is completely unrealistic to sat that the public should vote on every single issue . 
  we could just decide the major issues , like this multi-law `` packet '' we have the means to achieve a more direct democracy and avoid corruption . 
  you say that , by revolution the minority will decide of majority . 
  i say , that this is happening today not only in greece but everywhere in the world . 
  the elite decides , the ones that have capital and its absurd to believe the opposite . 
   if you do n't like the system you have why have you created it , kept it , voted for it , and why ca n't you change it democratically ? 
  the same answer as in the question `` why people accept poverty '' . 
  because they are apolitical and they are a huge propaganda against the ones that try to change the way the system is . 
  i can not believe people in 2014 , still accept the fact that there are people who die in hunger while in the 1st world throw food away . 
  also , i can not believe people accept that fact that they are poor and do n't know whom to blame or do n't even react . 
  in addition , in every riot , the police is there and use violence even when there is absolutely no need . 
  ( against disabled people , old people , etc ) even if somehow i could gather millions of people who want to overthrow government , government will try to break this gathering . 
  for example in june or july 2011 , they wanted to sign a similar to this recent multi-law `` packet '' . 
  they gathered people with masks and sticks to provoke police and break the gathering . 
  with this , even if people wanted democratically and peaceful want to overthrow the current government is pretty difficult . 
  on many of these events i mentioned , there photos/videos . 
  ukraine revolted some months ago against its democratically elected president . 
  by voting someone and have them elected for the next 4 years doesnt mean that you will agree with anything he said before the elections . 
  also , there is a high possibility he was lying just to get elected . 
  in my country , both of them happened . 
  also , democracy isnt working as it supposed to work , nowadays . 
  it should be done just like in ancient athens . 
  people should be asked all the time if they accept with each decision . 
  just 3 days ago , our government passed a multi-law `` packet '' with more than 300 pages . 
  people didnt even were asked . 
  today there was a new scandal . 
  corruption everywhere . 
  in my country , at least , young people are usually more the old ones when there is a riot and always there is at least one student 's bloc . 
  also , the more powerful riot the more younger people are .

  as if only youtube can stream audio leaks ... 
  from what i saw , a change in dns server is enough to bypass twitter 's block . 
  they can just use google 's or better , freedns 's dns ( 208.67.222.222 ) and access twitter . 
  but generally , a vpn is a hell of lot better, 
   when i went to college ( between 2005-2009 ) dorms were around $ 2000/semester . 
  the same applies for the massive fees-loans . 
   i had a 2 bedroom , 2 bathroom apartment with a kitchen and living room and it was still considered a dorm . 
  here , one friend of mine , live in one room with another random same-age person , some furniture and 2 seperate beds + bathroom . 
  of course , hotel doesnt let them any guests , not even his parents . 
  also , all these parties from movies in houses , i heard they are real . 
  are they ? 
  i dont know about the dorms in us but here , in order to be accepted in dorm your family must have very low income . 
  if you are accepted , then yes , its free . 
  in ** some cases ** , universities and dorms offer ( free ) food . 
  so if you are in a dorm , you can either eat in uni or in dorm . 
  bonus1 : until , now everyone could eat in the university i was taking about , even if you werent studying in this university . 
  now they are trying to forbid it . 
  bonus2 : some universities , own hotels and they offer some of the rooms to students . 
  edit : how much is the rent for dorm per month ? 
  in greece , the dorms are better . 
  not the slightest like norway 's prison but not like these dorms . 
  my gf lives in a dorm , in one of the biggest universities in greece ( auth ) and i can confirm that : * dorm provides food every morning , lunch , afternoon . 
  * there is proper heating . 
  this year around 7 days there were not heating * free electricity , water and wifi ( ~ around 30 mbps download/upload ) * no moisture * there are electricians , etc for any damages there used to be much better but it keeps getting worse since crisis.before or after last summer , it was said that there wont be any free food and some time the residents must pay rent . 
  until now , it didnt happen . 
  lol . 
  no , you are cultarely related to ancient macedonia as i to planet mars . 
  that about 30 years of bad government is true . 
  but honestly after so many countries hit by crisis , i started to believe that it was inevitable . 
  piigs ( or at least greece ) were just the ones , with worse government ( at least ) than the others . 
  why not freer from all ? 
   so why should they employ workers they do n't really need ? , are they supposed to be some sort of charitable institution that just gives away money to people ? 
  this must be changed sooner or later . 
  just because they are losing money , does n't mean that these `` useless '' people must be fired and starve . 
  food for thought : in 2030 , 2 billions work will be lost due to automation and robots . 
  of course , big companies are n't charitable institutions to pay the people who demand money and some rights when they can use robots to work 24/7 . 
  my country has never embraced communism , the corruption is too high and anything public never is being done right . 
  i do n't say that communism was different from what you say , but if we have to blame one economic system , it would n't be communism . 
  still , you are wrong . 
  how nobody is responsible for what is being done in sochi ?

  police from the beginning were protecting the rich people and always were against marches and leftists . 
  for example , if you do n't know , fascists this september killed pavlos fisas , because he was antifa . 
  today , it got known that , the police center , after the killing took place , said the policemen not to catch the killers and to stay away instead of catching them .

  i know it was just stupid talk on both sides , but i found it interesting how vilified greece became for a period of time . 
  it would only work if it was an island between italy and greece and both countries shared responsibility for the island camp , otherwise it would never work . 
  because they want them to leave france , they have absolutely no incentive to stop anything . 
  everybody knows you stole noahs ark from them !, 
  what treasures did you find in it that you keep secret :(, 
  crete is very far away from the crisis the main islands affected are kos and lesvos, 
  the goal is for 30-35 million tourists by 2030 , there is a major push to bring in the new chinese middle class and also upper-middle class/wealthy middle easterners ( dubai/uae/qatar / etc ), 
  you forgot armenians , 
  yes , you should always start by ordering 1-2 plates of kalamari and a few salads and french fries plates while you decide on your main meal . 
  did you go to thessaloniki ? 
  that seems to be the hub of turkish tourism in greece at the moment . 
   as the rest of europe pretty much owns it now . 
  that is stupid to say , and not close to reality . 
  russian tourists have also dropped in greece due to crisis , but eu tourism has gained huge amount . 
  for example on zakynthos island , russian tourist has dropped 80 % in 2015 compared to 2014 , but polish tourist have risen 80 % to cover that gap . 
  greek tourism officials have done a great job this season in promoting tourism to eu during the crisis weeks when banks were shut down , they managed to salvage the season and hit all the projection goals . 
  not in same group as faroe islands , so we have a chance . 
  the candidate will be tsipras , he is resigning for the sole purpose of consolidating his power within syriza . 
  the only other likely candidate would be [ tsakalotos ] ( https://youtu.be/wofkcembrge?t=4m40s ) , the finance minister . 
  i was thinking the same thing recently , but i was thinking of the post-ice age migration into europe . 
  athenians were great warriors but suffered from poor leadership due to democracy . 
  democracy only works in peace time and athens was in a state of war or near-war at all times , i think they just got to comfortable and this caused their downfall . 
  due to poor leadership they decided to send 40,000 of their best men to sicily to fight the spartan kingdom there , they lost all the men and they got athens destroyed due to this as sparta then sieged the walls of athens and took it eventually . 
  athenians also were not able to make long-lasting alliances with greek city-states because they viewed themselves as the natural ruler of all greeks , and looked down upon the lower greek city-states , including makedon before philip came along . 
  makedon basically did everything opposite of athens which is why they succeded where athens failed . 
  they made long-lasting alliances with other city-states , they had a militaristic monarchy and not some democracy led by senile old men , they shared wealth and glory and riches of conquest , they modernized their military with new tactics and weapons , and they did not look down on others . 
  sparta and athens basically destroyed each other while philip was uniting all the northern greek tribes , it 's hard to say who would have won if all 3 were at their peak . 
  they are brought to athens , some stay in refugee center and others take public bus to thessaloniki . 
  not much you can do to control them since it would be against `` rights '' of the illegals, 
  varoufakis opposes the pro-russia stance of lafazanis . 
  varoufakis will stay in syriza unless he quits politics, 
  this election will make syriza more powerful and stable which is why juncker backs this decision, 
  the best greek show is `` 60 minutes greece '' here is a full episode , https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxi1ncwyu0 i have seen a bunch of episodes , you will not find a better place to see areas of greece outside of the touristy areas , they have great cinematography ( ? 
  ) / photography on the show , you can see very nice images on it . 
  another episode - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woiz5tnubwy, 
  tsipras called this election due to far-left section of his party opposing the bailout . 
  tsipras has no real competition in upcoming elections like last one , and he has around 70 % approval rating . 
  tsipras has something like 70 % approval rating , he will win by land-slide . 
  there is nobody else even close to him , lafazanis is considered a communist/radical element with very little support . 
  true story , a bunch of germans just stole a bag of fish from this morning , i have reported this german fish stealing gang to the police . 
  lafazanis is really hated right now for fucking everything up , he would see a new crisis happen in greece just to get a few votes . 
  the problem is that everybody sees through his disgusting plan , i hope his political career gets destroyed on september 20 . 
  the left platform led by lafazanis will certainly split from syriza , this will make syriza a more center-left party, 
  greece has no control of any of these `` migrants '' , most of them before even reaching greece have contacts in northern europe through mosque or family connections that transport them . 
  the problem is that nobody in europe wants more of incompatible migrants . 
  we can handle a small amount of 3rd world aggressive muslims , not a never-ending stream of them . 
  nobody would be angry if these were ukrainian immigrants running away from war , they have same culture and can assimilate easily . 
  3rd world islamic immigration is not sustainable and its going to lead to civil conflict across europe if it continues as it is right now . 
  albanian/greek mafia ( yes they work together ) bring them to northwest greece and bring them to italy with boats or just up the border through croatia . 
  around 95 % according to un, 
  there is not much syriza can do but try to make the deal as good as possible , which from what i have read they are doing . 
  this 14 regional airport deal was made years ago by new democracy but has been stalled for a long time . 
  in re-worked deal at least 10-15 % of airport stake will be kept in local control . 
  [ there a few privatizations that have been stalled for a while and part of bailout agreement is that the stalled projects must be fast-tracked ] ( http://www.ekathimerini.com/200636/article/ekathimerini/business/port-elliniko-regional-airports-to-be-fast-tracked-by-taiped ), 
  title is not editorialized . 
  previous energy minister lafazanis , is a russian puppet and wants to leave euro for drachma . 
  he was putting all his cards on the table for the gazprom pipeline and was not making good impression with azerbaijan . 
  since he left his position the new energy minister has priortized the tap pipeline . 
  this does not mean that gazprom pipeline wont happen , it likely will but it is not being prioritized as the only option like previous energy minister . 
  syriza did not make this deal , this was under contract from new democracy . 
  part of the bailout agreement was that all privitizations that have been stalled the last few years must be fast-tracked , this includes this 14 regional airport , piraeus deal , ellinko development and a few smaller ones . 
  the only controversial one is this airport deal but from reports i have read about it there is going to be thousands of jobs created and modernization of these airports will also happen , so i will not judge until a few years after the deal is complete . 
  those ducks were confirmed to have spied on military positions tbf, 
  shale gas is the homosex of natural resources, 
  your local orthodox church is fine also, 
  mostly british but also greeks and other tourists, 
  british traditional pubs are very common in greek tourism areas , most of them run and managed by ex-pats . 
  yes , but in delian league the small village like city-states understood that athens , thebes , etc were in charge just like the smaller nations of eu understand that the bigger nations are essentially in charge . 
  obviously the eu is far far more democratic than the delian league but i found some similarities interesting . 
  that is true i have actually been thinking about it lately . 
  the modern eu is sort of like the [ delian league ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/delian_league ) . 
  eu essentially plays the role of the delian league and the nations within the eu act like the city-state . 
  so in a way modern europe already is a city-state structure with the inception of the eu . 
  eventually the delian league fell when it became the athenian empire in all but name , and city-states began to revolt . 
  ( i do n't see this happening with eu but just found it interesting ), 
  i was going to debate that a city-state structure in modern europe could actually work , but i do n't think this is right thread to debate that . 
  edit : for example , luxemborg is an example of a modern city-state both in size and structure .

  30 fucking seconds ** also op is an islamic propagandist , look at his post history ** `` the quran/hadith warns about groups such as isis : '' hahaha `` in all fairness , this behaviour is n't exclusive to muslims .

  `` there 's 2 types of jihad , the bigger jihad and the smaller jihad .

  `` that muslims are good people , they are n't . '', 
  i always find it hilarious how people like you use some african warlords waging war against other tribes as some sort of christian religious war . 
  the reason people in car are killing each other is not because of religion , it is because ak-47 's were handed out to tribal societies with no other form of way to make a living other than pillaging each other . 
  now also , please compare car `` christian '' fighters to the actual big african religious militaries like boko haram and al-shabab which have 1000000000x more fighters . 
  boko haram will eventually control half of nigeria , with a population of hundreds of millions under their control .

  so no blocking from our part apparently, 
   but is germany in particular criticized by the greek public ? 
  yes  maybe he 's looking for a public head-to-head where he can score some concessions for domestic political points ? 
  yup, 
  from an inside perspective , you 're right ( unfortunately ), 
   had the vote of over 180,000 people in the 2014 parliamentary elections that 's ... nothing . 
  fucking golden dawn in greece , received almost 400.000 ( 400k ) votes in 2015 . 
  and the population in ukraine is almost 4 times bigger than that of greece ( 40ish mil in ukraine - 10ish mil in greece ), 
  we chose poverty , because we got tired of swimming in money . . who the fuck writes these articles ? 
  if we were rich , we would n't be able to beg for moar euromonies . . that 's why . 
  we ** chose ** to remain poor in order to receive more money !, 
  ha take that eu, 
  it used to be like that in greece , then the gvt appointed some assholes , gave them a raise and they shut up, 
  judges are public servants , they are not handpicked and appointed . 
  i was mostly referring to the `` high '' judges who are directly appointed by the gvt.these people do n't give a shit about the average worker, 
  the judges , even though they are independent from the gvt , are appointed by them . . you ca n't bite the hand that feeds . . btw replying to your previous comment , the working conditions for the average worker in greece are terrible , everyone knows that , yet noone attempts to fix it . 
  the measures syriza proposed would just scratch the surface unfortunately, 
   due to the lack of law enforcement mostly because of that . 
  the legislation is fine, 
  was the name republicains picked by chance ? 
  does it imply something ? 
   devalue currency  print more money to pay off debts how did n't we think of that earlier ? 
  wow it 's so simple after all  greece could avoid the austerity measures which are so unpopular i guess we will avoid austerity by printing more money . . 
  damn it 's so simple, 
  damn you 're right . . anyways , getting payed for all the months you work is so 2003 . 
  i personally have n't received a salary in 6 months and i 'm proud of it, 
  why 8 and not 5 ?

  maybe i do . . getting a pension at 26 while in public sector just does n't happen . 
  you simply do n't have enough years to qualify , even for a ( very ) reduced pension . 
  unless he 's referring to medically discharged workers , it 's simply impossible . 
  i guess my experience living and working in greece does n't count . . 
  it 's impossible to get a pension at 26 in greece . 
  simple, 
  bravo !, 
  bismark ? 
   as early as the age of 26 years old . 
  lol , i 'm over 26 and still have n't retired . . 
  so no 26 and retired does n't happen , sorry, 
  `` an open letter from ( some of ) the mods of croatia , albania , bih , kossovo '', 
  or / r/greece . 
  actually it 's just croatia , albania ( one person ) , bih ( 2 ) , kossovo . . not exactly the mods of balkan subs as the title suggests tho, 
  h&k is a multinational company and one of the biggest defence industries worldwide . 
  and the have less personnel than eas ... 
  we 'll sell them dear , not keep them to ourselves !, 
  the tanks could be used as bait while we throw rocks at airplanes and landing ships . 
  but you did n't learnt that from me, 
   much of the equipment bought however is not even suited for successful defenses i disagree . 
  unless you have specific examples . 
   your government just bought it because they were either bribed or because they wanted to have equipment in numbers equal to turkey ( or both ) unfortunately you 're right . 
  nevertheless , the imia incident caused a massive arms-race which noone could block at the time . 
  our military 's main goal is to defend a possible attack from turkey . 
  after the collapse of the ussr there are no other enemis nearby who could successfully attack greece . 
  so , yes you 're right, 
  on their [ website ] ( http://www.eas.gr/en/52/our-company ) it says 800 people . 
  no idea how accurate it is, 
  no idea , but is sounds plausible . 
  their ammunition was frequently considered sub - standard though, 
  haha the eas ( hellenic defence systems ) , the company that 's supposed to build the ak 's employs 800 people !!!!, 
  more than h&k and with achievements no where close to h&k, 
  that article is bullshit . 
  firstly , manufacturing a rifle , does not mean abandoning nato standards . 
  furthermore , some nato countries are actually using the ak 's with no issues concerning their nato membership . 
  secondly , co-manufacturing a rifle , already produced in several other countries will not mean that greek forces will have to replace their existing rifles . 
  thirdly , the original source ( onalert . 
  gr a defence oriented - read bullshit website ) is clickbait article with stupid remarks such as '' the russians , saw the facilities , were thrilled and they openly said that they 're good for them ( my translation ) . 
  conclusion : bullshit article , bullshit source , written by and for the greek russophiles . 
  [ that 's ] ( http://www.onalert.gr/stories/mosxa-kalei-athina-apantiste-mas-an-mporeite-na-ftiaxete-ta-nea-kalasnikov/42798 ) the original article in greek edit : nato members , bulgaria and albania use the ak-47 ( according to wiki ) and greece could produce the ak-101 variant which uses the nato 5.56 caliber with no need to abandon nato standards . 
  so , plenty of mistakes on that article, 
  who the fuck is this guy and why is he on the list ?? 
  is it because he 's an enemy of kammenos ? 
  that 's 4chan / pol mentality, 
  true , although that vote did n't mean much in reality, 
  curious : 90 % of your comments on / r/europe are bashing greece and greeks . 
  do you have an agenda ? 
  are you simply pissed off ? 
  what 's the deal ? 
  games without frontiers    eurovision, 
  does the article mention that we need to give 10bn in order to become members of the bank or no ? 
  the brics bank that has n't even been established yet ? 
  the same bank that will fund development funds in emerging countries ? 
  the same bank that has brazil as a founding member , a country that was against the imf aid to greece ? 
  yeah they will definitely fund greece, 
  to be honest greece has already defaulted 4 times in its history ( 1892,1922,1932,1945 ) . 
  still waiting for that recovery though, 
  deflation is bad mmkay . 
  especially for poorer people ... also by printing more money , inflation will increase and the public will essentially become poorer . 
  not to mention that a devaluation of the ( possible ) new drachma will mean that the debt will increase ( since its in euros ), 
   however he can go back if things go bad . 
  unlike most of the greek population . 
  that 's why i despise him, 
  remeber the wise words of varoufakis : '' kostas lapavitsas ? 
  he build a career on supporting a return to drachmas '', 
  none actually . 
  the dude lived/lives in the uk has a paycheck from his university in pounds , he has stocks and deposits in english banks . . 
  honestly , if i were him , i would support a grexit as well, 
  how did you reach the conclusion that i was annoyed ? 
  syriza has already agreed to extend enfia .

  well , none of the [ overseas departments ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/iso_3166-2:fr#overseas_departments ) has a flag ( except maybe [ mayotte ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mayotte ) , but that barely counts as a flag , and it 's [ unofficial ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/flag_and_coat_of_arms_of_mayotte ) anyway ) , so they wo n't be included . 
  as i replied [ elsewhere ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6mkjzb/user_flair_flags_reorganization/dk2bved/ ) :  let me note here that since the post-2016 1st level administrative divisions do not have flags ( some of them only have some horrible logos ) , especially for france we are sticking with the pre-2016 divisions . 
  do we currently have french overseas territories ? 
  this modding business has certainly stretched my geography skills past their breaking point !, 
  i 've already got an earful from catalans  edit : demonym correction . 
  basque country ( france ) is part of aquitaine ( pre-2016 ) or nouvelle-aquitaine ( post-2016 ) . 
  let me note here that since the post-2016 1st level administrative divisions do not have flags ( some of them only have some horrible logos ) , especially for france we are sticking with the pre-2016 divisions . 
  i 'm afraid amsterdam does n't even appear on the [ relevant iso 3166 list ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/iso_3166-2:nl ) . 
  russia is a major project ... 
  it has way too many 1st level regional divisions , some of which are in asia ( so they should n't be added ) . 
  i hope i do have enough spaces to fit the russian flags , but it may have to wait for phase ii of the reorg project ( where regional flags will probably be assigned by a bot instead of being user-selectable by the limiting reddit flair selection system ), 
  this was the reason for the reorg , so , yes ( but give me time ) . 
  yes , i 'm not just using eu here , i 'm going for the whole of europe . 
  i 'm also removing the `` shine '' effect on some of the flags , which is really distorting the actual flag colors . 
  the german flag was one of those flags which was changed to remove that `` shine '' effect , so you 're seeing the true colors of it , which are much better and more vivid than what we had before . 
  yes , since there was some complaints ( understandable ) , i thought to lay out the plan . 
  i 'll have to do the count , but i think that palestine is recognized by less than 50 % of the european countries ( but it 's very close ) . 
  edit : i 'm counting 17 european countries . 
  i might be counting wrong though . 
  edit 2 : i 'm also counting 22 european countries that do n't recognize palestine , so it 's most likely going to be removed . 
  there is no `` eu '' flair , there 's a `` europe '' flair . 
  the [ flag of 12 golden stars on a blue background is the flag of europe ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/flag_of_europe ) , created in 1955 , and only * adopted * by the european union ( actually the european economic community at the time ) in 1985 . 
  have you read the [ faq about user flairs ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/wiki/user_flairs ) ? 
  it 's stated quite clearly there . 
  so , no , the european flag is not going to be removed . 
  scotland * is * a uk region , and this will be reflected on the default flair text . 
  spatharios is a male name ( not a very common one , btw ) , so i 'm sure the ones that gave him that name have looked under his tail, 
  my own cat has the same colors , and he 's definitely a he . 
  edit : he even had a sister with the exact same colors ( and it was definitely a sister ) . 
   and now , what 's going to happen to us without barbarians ? 
   they were , those people , a kind of solution .

   but in government , alexis tsipras , prime minister , must tread carefully . 
  his coalition partner , the small rightwing independent greeks , or anel , is fiercely nationalist . 
  anel are in a very precarious position right now .

  marie le pen is looking the favorite to lead france next elections and she has already stated that her first goal after winning election is to abandon the euro currency and `` regain sovereignty '' . 
  if italy does not improve very very quicly under renzi 's leadership they will turn to far-right parties also like france to abandon the euro currency . 
  lines up with what ive been saying for a while very high percentage will stare/possibly intimidate in the top 3 safest as far as physical/verbal abuse, 
  it is still too early to tell if merkel was a genius or a villain during this crisis . 
  we will know within 10-15 years after everything settles if austerity truly worked or not and put eu onto the right track . 
  send the entire fleet of europe to protect our sea borders create a unified border military of units from every country to protect the land borders of europe create the strictest immigration laws based on japanese immigration laws . 
  if those 3 things do n't happen , there wo n't be a eu future,

  it is not like greece will stop spending money on military . 
  greece has met its 2 % required nato spending for the last 40 years , why stop now ? 
  they also kill dozens of innocent females in so called `` honor '' killings every week , very brutal culture in general . 
  this is same people who allowed a nurse who took care of a deceased ebola patient to go on vacation for a week freely without question and did not even attempt to test her until she demanded it . 
  shocked !, 
  ah ok , didnt know that, 
  `` repercussions '' aka , 5 years in a comfy jail , preaching 24/7 about the `` glory '' of jihadism they witnessed in syria , etc. 
  converting and radicalizing hundreds in the jails , which has become an epidemic in uk for over a decade or more now . 
  they are n't `` disillusioned '' , they are just preparing for the next stage of their jihad , to think otherwise is idiocy . 
   lend to greece , you 're nazis , dont lend to greece , you 're nazis nein , kke hardcore commies are ones responsible for thinking this way . 
  they pull insane stunts to get attention , and pretty much call everyone nazi 's in greek government . 
  poland matters because it is the center-piece of america 's european strategy for the next century , as it is located between germany and russia . 
  also polish people are very pro-american so it makes sense . 
  i believe the reason he did this was to hurt ukraine 's chances of recovery the food ban created a massive surplus of european food products which had to be then subsidized and managed by eu to not cause any problems . 
  ukraine 's best chance for short-term improvement in the economy was selling alot of its food products in europe , now with this ban this is impossible as there is already to many competing products that are already subsidized . 
  `` do not panic !,

  the us head of the hydra had been lopped off , reflecting the ban on food imports from the us , eu , norway , canada and australia that russia adopted in august , said the exhibit organiser , mikhail antonov . 
  wtf . 
  i have no idea , most likely if its a fake call you will get a warning to not do it again . 
  i very much doubt the euro currency will exist by 2020 , but i still very much hope the eu exists at least, 
  then why is joe biden going there like he did this week and pretending a solution is possible when its not ? 
  just stop attempting to even negotiate and build the pipeline with israel , and like i said earlier this has everything to do with the pipeline since plot 12 is the central location of israel  cyprus pipeline and the cyprus  greece section joe biden is currently the most likely to become next president of usa which makes this even more interesting . 
  my point still stands . 
  greek people like russia because they like russian people . 
  most people who hate russia also dislike russian people, 
  ok , its actually very simple all you need is [ nescafe greek frappe ] ( http://pythagoreancup.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/nescafe-frappe-classic-200gr.jpg ) , milk , sugar and ice-cubes for ingredients . 
  the only other thing you need is the hand-mixer such as [ this one ] ( http://img.auctiva.com/imgdata/1/3/4/8/9/9/7/webimg/435050468_tp.jpg ) , hand-mixer is preferable so you can make the coffee very quickly in the cup you put ingredients in , takes around 60 seconds when you learn to make it . 
  this is actually why it became very popular since in post ww2 greece , greek people wanted a very quick way to make coffee and now its the main coffee drink in the country especially with youths . 
  put in 2-3 spoons of nescafe in cup 2 . 
  put 2-3 spoons of sugar in cup 3 . 
  fill 1/4th of cup with milk 4 . 
  use hand-mixer to mix everything in the cup 5 . 
  add a bit more milk , add around 4-6 ice-cubes and top it off with water 6 . 
  put in straw and enjoy , 
  that makes no sense though . 
  why plot 12 all the way down there ? 
  are they claiming gas for plot 12 ? 
  plot 2/3 could be understandable since its near the north, 
  like russian people is not the same as liking russian government, 
  those russians sure love their catalan independence , huh ? 
  you would think its the most critical event in eu currently , i wonder why that is ... 
   six out of every 10 who dial 1517 are reporting siblings or other relatives for tax evasion . 
  experts tend to see these as acts of revenge rather than genuine attempts to help the ministry of finance identify tax evaders . 
    divorcees wishing to embroil their former partners in a tax scandal also figure prominently among those who dial 1517 . 
  do any finns want to know how to make greek frappe ( iced coffee ) ? 
  do n't think iced coffee is very popular up there but i can give you steps if you want them, 
  lmao !, 
  the pipeline is extremely relevant , joe biden visited 2 days ago to discuss the pipeline with greek leaders as it has become a priority for us geo-political goals in the region, 
  this also likely has to do with the [ greek cyprus/israel pipeline ] ( http://www.cyprusgasnews.com/id/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/the-east-med-pipeline2.jpg ) currently being developed, 
  i dont get it ? 
  they banned the sell of this chocolate ? 
  back then the highest tech available was a propeller plane with a small calliber machine gun glued on top today the highest tech available is a city destroyer that can travel 10,000 miles through the atmosphere and then theres nato .

  well , there has been a drone program since 1978 which developed the [ pegasus i \\ ( 1986 \\ ) and pegasus ii ( 2003 ) ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hai_pegasus ) surveillance drones, 
  [ the program has three stated goals  ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dassault_neuron ) 1 . 
  to maintain and develop the skills of the ** participating european ** ( should have clarified ) aerospace companies ' design offices , which will not see any other new fighter programs before 2030 now that the rafale , eurofighter and gripen projects are all complete or well underway . 
  to investigate and validate technologies that will be needed by 2015 to design next-generation combat aircraft . 
  to validate an innovative cooperation process by establishing a european industry team responsible for developing next-generation combat aircraft .

  http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2g4l4w/sweden_giving_permanent_residency_to_any_syrian/ckg203m?context=3 , 
  because the eu is the european union , not the world union . 
  when eu was first created i thought the purpose was to create a european brother-hood to protect each other . 
  . all i see is the opposite . 
  also most importantly , a refugee from ukrainian can very easily assimilate into the host nation , especially due to same religion ( orthodox or catholic ) and the fact that all of europe shares a common history so there is no major cultural boundaries to cross that middle-eastern refugees can not seem to over-come . 
  savannajeff thinks it is `` racist '' to discuss race/ethnicity in any fashion , i 've brought up this point up before and he called me racist for assuming it would be a bad thing that swedes would be a minority in their own nation, 
  nobody is against european refugees , i would gladly accept any ukrainian war refugee without a second thought .

  claiming no jews died on 9/11 and they didnt go to work on purpose isnt exactly the message of a rational person .

  these tweets were made on a long span the last years , he deleted his account but several screenshots exist . 
  he claims his account was hacked , there is an investigation underway ( whether its even his account or not , and if it was hacked ) . 
  personally if it is his account , i dont see how he was hacked , the messages arent on a specific date but on a very large period of time and then suddenly the minute he becomes subminister , he deletes it . 
  i dont see how the 20 + % unemployment economies of greece and spain for instance can benefit from it . 
  i think that a city was near that was sacked by huns and then afterwards according to legend , the medieval/modern venice was founded on the laguna . 
  fair enough . 
  why ? 
  horse meat is perfectly fine for consumption when properly processed . 
  the issue with horse meat is when they tried to shove old horses full on drugs as proper meat or present it as veal/pork . 
  more like 6 % of the greeks that can vote ( and add close to 40 % abstention ), 
  well the issues arent on the transport side , more on the processing , fingerprinting and issuing identification papers is too much for an island the size of lesbos . 
  as for expenses , if i am not mistaken the refugees pay for their own tickets , but i could be wrong . 
  thats not really true , the larger ferries that the government has leased can support 2.000 + passengers per trip ( el.venizelos has a 2.500 capacity ), 
  the real question is , how many other car companies tempered with their test mode to gain favorable readings ? 
  i fear vw is the tip of a very disturbing iceberg . 
  there are no issues with cash on atm since even july . 
  ( especially since you go to athens and rhodes , not some 50 permanent residents island ) you wont face any issues . 
  the same shit , cc are a constant pain in the ass and their effects in some parts of the economy were really really bad . 
  on the upside it was a record tourist year ( 26 million visitors ) so at least the economy recieved a much needed boon from that . 
  it would be suicide to actually try the land border with turkey , fences , mines , highly protected area ( i believe the same is on the bulgarian borders with turkey ) . 
  the islands way is the easiest , winter or summer , the distances from turkey shores are simply too small . 
  in contrast i believe the unsc needs more permament members , the original distinction behind it ( the 5 first nuclear powers ) doesnt leave room for other major nations that have been developed since then ( india/brazil ) . 
  perhaps a rework on the veto procedures is needed more than removing the rights from one country . 
  < < a recent survey of 1,365 syrians from all 14 governorates of the country   isnt close to half of syria occupied by isis , how exactly where the people living under is participated in this poll ( and depending on the answer , the % of positive views might be not so surprising ), 
  like vikings before burning england is the obvious answer . 
  unfortunately yes , i dont believe by a larger margin than before but it will most likely make gd retain its 3rd position on the parliament ( though its gon na be a nine party parliament , thats gon na be interesting ), 
  gd numbers tend to be lower on most polls in contradiction to the actual results ( i dont know if people are ashamed to admit they vote for gd ) . 
  keep in mind though , the greek polls have lost all credibility the last year , i dont know how they fucked the science behind it or had an agenda in mind , but on the referendum , they were terribly inaccurate . 
  the problem is that you destroy one organisation and another takes its place , its a modern hydra . 
  the difference though with terrorist groups of the past , is that isis has managed to establish a state ( medieval , but nontheless a state ) , with a rather well equipped force and a huge occupied area . 
  every time the west tried to intervene ( iraq , libya ) it destabilized the situation to the point where this extreme groups apear anyway ( wasnt isis born in the abu ghraib prison for instance ) its an endless cycle of shit , with no easy solutions . 
  which is very good , the long term price deals with individual eu countries , resulted in a huge variation of gas prices , with particular higher than normal on eastern members . 
  i am curious if this move is in conjunction with the increased financial issues gazprom is currently facing , the last thing it needed was issues on the european sector ( especially after the whole russian-chinese connection has cost 10s of billions based on a 100dollar/barrel prize tag ), 
  you got ta keep in mind that most of the these small nations were rather poor before they became tax-heaven/gambling centers . 
  monaco for example was on the verge of bankcurpcy before the first casino opened . 
  time-travel . 
  this has happened before , a year ago ? 
  a ship tried to do the same route turkey-libya carrying weapons and armaments again . 
  whats staggering is the numbers , 5000 firearms and hundreds of thousands of bullets , is a bit worrying . 
  3 units are already there , tranferred from athens . 
  also police intervnenes mostly when demonstrations turn violent , that hasnt happened the last year . 
  if you think the greek army opresses the citizens , the last time you read the news about greece must have been 1973 . 
  lesbos as all the islands near turkey has high military presence including armor units , if it came to that , the response would have been exceptionally swift . 
  the last thing you want though is to turn our islands into a military ground , using the army should be the last resort . 
  they have to be documented first and then they will take a ship specifically allocated for this purpose by the government . 
  the problem is the sheer number of people , just on lesbos , the estimate is for 20.000 people , the local authorities ( police/coast guard ) are simply not enough to document them fast enough . 
  and as you understand funds arent exactly flowing atm ( and being in charge an essentially transition governement untill the elections doesnt really give much room for initiatives ) . 
  tensions seem to be getting higher day by day , extra police units has been sent on some the affected islands but the reality is that the current rate of people coming is simply too much for a country the size of greece , crisis or not crisis . 
  the attack that even the french secret service admits was a huge mistake . 
  i can never understand the logic of the man who planned and ordered this . 
  and from comments by new zealand people , it seems to be a black spot between france and new zealand . 
  isnt the prepaid tax about business and self-employed people ( \u03b5\u03bb\u03b5\u03cd\u03b8\u03b5\u03c1\u03bf\u03b9 \u03b5\u03c0\u03b1\u03b3\u03b3\u03b5\u03bb\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03af\u03b5\u03c2 ) , the majority of people that are on salaries dont have to pre-pay anything . 
  i agree that its a stupid measure but thank god its not for everyone . 
  also i laugh at the drachma lovers . 
  how can greece deal with 10s of thousands new arrivals when we can barely keep our economy afloat . 
  there is so many islands in close proximity to turkey shores that policing em is already a huge task . 
  you make it sound like its an easy task to document em , have you seen what happens every day ? 
  when you have 2000 more from day to day , how can the islands local police force ( usually 10 people at most ) cope with the process ? 
  many islands , close proximity ( some are one swim away ) from turkey , lack of funds and you get the picture . 
  most of the islands that are close to turkey shores are on the red since june and things only get worse . 
  i am looking forward for the famines and mass executions . 
  its sad that greeks that have lived for thousands of years in the black sea have to leave their ancestral homes . 
  one by one , the last elements of ancient/medieval greek colonies vanish from the black sea . 
  i imagine it was more like viking style greek pirates raiding egypt ( the infamous sea people ), 
  its on the edge between the middle helladic period ( which also has the old palace period for the minoan civilization ) and the mycenean greece . 
  its incredible how advanced both civilizations were only to be followed by the greek dark ages which saw a rapid collapse of civilization and population decline until the archaic period and gradual advancement to classical greece . 
  there were attempts to bulgarize the bulgarian occupation zone during ww2 . 
  100.000 people had been expelled and bulgarian settlers were encouraged to come in . 
  while excellent as news , the other case of allegedly odysseus palace excavation site in ithaca remains abandoned from lack of funds . 
  there is the same danger for amphipolis tomb . 
  we seem to have that issue in greece , we discover something of immense historical value but take forever to properly develop it as a tourist attraction . 
  limb clinics on every corner , illuminati schemes , detroit relevant again and chip augmentations . 
  good morning mister jensen . 
  the law is a bit foggy but it seems not , whats obligatory is the light/reflection device . 
  most cyclists disregard the law , move without a helmet , ignore traffic lights . 
  the worst part is they have the smug attitude of being above all for using a bicycle . 
  the infrastructure is also non existant for the people that genuine and safely want to a use a bicycle in most cities . 
  how many times i see cyclists ignore basic traffic law or moving on the night without a single light/reflection . 
  hmm also we should add the size difference , romania is 30 % ? 
  larger than greece . 
  so in essense they have far more forests . 
  why exactly are you surprised , we are a mostly mountainous country besides the 5000 islands . 
  unfortunately summer forest fires is a yearly plague . 
  i wonder if this move is amplified by the serious gazprom financial issues . 
  from the very costly infrastructure plan to china ( spent tens of billions on a very ambitious plan on an assumption of a 100 dollar/barrel on oil ) to the serious decline of exports and oil/gas prices . 
  you know it may sound childish , but my first contact with kalevala was through don rosa scrooge mc duck adventure . 
  it was a really sureal depiction of a very unknown mythological setting ( for greece anyway ) . 
  it really struck me as very interesting when i was younger . 
  liechtenstein exports food to russia ? 
  if i remember correctly from another source , he had access to like 15 family supercars . 
  what a spoiled little shit . 
  so a combination of mulitple billion infrastructure investments made with the assumption of a high petrol price , serious decline of exports and the continuous low price levels of petrol products . 
  damn it , for years i want to visit istanbul but things like this and more severe attacks in the past , make me scared . 
  i know i would love the trip , the food , the culture and of course the history of the city , but i just dont feel safe going . 
  unfortunately with our farmers that doesnt compute , they have spent a good 30 years siphoning eu funds , buyring peaches and cultivating cotton . 
  zero modernization , many tax reductions and yet we still import even animal food .

  they would never get elected again . 
  if they reach that level by themselves then it 's not only greece , the euro concept has a problem and a second haircut wo n't be the real issue . 
   wolfgang sch\u00e4uble admitted that back in 1994 , he had accepted a dm 100,000 cash donation handed over from karlheinz schreiber, 
  russia , greece and support in the same sentence . 
  sorry , let me grab a photo while it 's still day . 
  granted i 'm not exactly in the center of civilization . 
  we use common incandescent ( yellow ) lamps in the more civilized parts . 
  like [ these ] ( http://www.protothema.gr/files/1/2015/01/07/attiki-odos-ena.jpg ) . 
  the article states ** recent ** history , the title is not . 
  but hey , that 's not editorializing . 
  having the biggest debt defaults in the past 25years is the same as having the biggest debt defaults in history ... right ? 
  we use the most energy conserving lamps in the world . 
  colorless , zero maintenance , eco friendly , the works . 
  [ here 's ] ( http://i.imgur.com/s73vs9e.jpg ) an example right outside my house . 
  eurogroup to reconvene tomorrow 11:00 local time ( +1 gmt ) . 
  no press conference to be had at this time . 
  i 've heard that they want imf in as well , and imf calls for unanimous decision ( technicalities ? ), 
  as there are tabloids in germany , there are tabloids in greece . 
  no one can forget the nazi-merkel front page for instance . 
   and of course the greek media are biased , why should they not be ? 
  they are entitled to their freedom of expression and opinion just as much as anybody else - that is what opinion pieces are for . 
  we 're not talking about op ` eds here . 
  we 're talking about misinformation and propaganda . 
  we 're talking about reporters asking questions and when not hearing the answers that they `` expect '' stopping and shoving off the interviewee to go to the next one . 
  we 're talking about breaking the law the day before the referendum and having politicians with active campaigns toward the yes being on air for hours . 
  we 're talking about spreading rumors and verified lies for days . 
  so , no they are not entitled to doing that . 
   the troika wants austerity . 
  they have also shown in the past that they are willing to participate in massive debt restructuring to help the greek debt load . 
  they value the euro and want to protect it . 
  however , they still have to answer to constituents at home , so they do have some limit where they will allow a country to exit . 
   do we agree on all this ? 
  ** agreed . 
  **  if so , then it seem totally reasonable to assume that greece could have gotten pretty much the exact same deal that they approved this week much earlier . 
   do we agree on all this ? 
  ** any sort of dept relief , be it restructuring or haircut was off the table . 
  a promise of consideration from juncker was the best offered and that after the referendum was announced . 
  schaeuble was pretty adamant . 
   the reason they did n't get the deal earlier is because syriza was determined to be as toxic and inflammatory as possible . 
  as i said , there was no offer of debt relief . 
  till imf released that report and before the referendum , it was off the table . 
   if we can agree on all this , then is n't it totally reasonable for me to conclude that you did n't go through all the pain of the last six months for the plan that you are getting now ? 
  we do n't agree . 
   the media are by and large quite reasonable i can assure you , they 're far from reasonable . 
  they 're hardcore biased , pushing oligarchic agendas ( 4-5 families control all the media ) in blatantly obvious ways . 
  if you did not pay attention to what happened during the referendum weekend , look around reddit here or on / r/greece for older posts and you 'll get a good idea . 
  when your only resource for somewhat unbiased news is the national tv and a site run by 4-5 reporters , you know things are pretty messed up . 
  i do n't know . 
  heck most of the economists do n't know , much less common people . 
  it 's possible , even probable . 
  but we 're very pro-eu as a people . 
  i am not arguing that there was n't a better way to achieve this . 
   the fact that so many greeks seem to was a good deal to tank the economy so that they could talk shit suggests some pretty negative things about your prospects for long term health ... no-one wanted for things to reach this level . 
  you may think we do , your media may suggest we do , but we do n't . 
  we do n't enjoy living day to day with uncertainty and with no access to a banking system . 
  we sure as hell do n't enjoy being the ridicule of eu . 
  what i - and i believe most of us - want is for the situation to become viable . 
  will it be ? 
  we do n't know . 
  we sure as hell knew though that as the things were , it was n't . 
  thank you very much for the translation . 
  not enough recognition for so much work . 
  cheers from a non german speaking fellow . 
  the only thing i really care about is if the situation is viable . 
  if they can get debt restructuring along with the measures and we 're not in the same situation in 1-2 years again , i 'm pretty fine with that . 
  besides , i knew what i was voting for . 
   the bail-out did not however only benefit foreign banks , but also greek depositors and households , as one-third of the debt was held by greek banks and other greek financial institutions . 
   moreover , private creditors were not off the hook , and , in 2012 , debt was substantially reduced : the 2012 private sector involvement ( psi ) operation led to a haircut of more than 50 % on about $ 200 billion of privately held debt , so leading to a decrease in debt of over $ 100 billion ( to be concrete , a reduction of debt of 10,000 euros per greek citizen ) . 
  you see , while he mentions that 1/3 of the debt was held by the greek banks/financial institutions and was bailed out , he neglects to mention that the haircut affected that debt as well . 
  and as a result of that haircut , an extra $ 50b of loans to recapitalize the greek banks were needed . 
  so while true the haircut led to a $ 100b decrease in debt , the new loans increased the debt by $ 50b , making it essentially a $ 50b decrease . 
  what he also fails to mention was that the original debt was taken under greek laws , the new loans where under british laws . 
  so a possibility of default would be extremely costly for greece . 
   the decrease in output was indeed much larger than had been forecast . 
  multipliers were larger than initially assumed . 
  but fiscal consolidation explains only a fraction of the output decline . 
  output above potential to start , political crises , inconsistent policies , insufficient reforms , grexit fears , low business confidence , weak banks , all contributed to the outcome . 
  that 's the problem with imf . 
  on such a volatile environment their projections did not account for any sociopolitical factors . 
  they assumed all would be great , market confidence would return and simply did the math . 
  nobody blamed just fiscal consolidation for the outcome . 
  the policy of austerity was not to blame alone for this mess . 
  but assuming that growth would return just because you 've tightened the belt is ridiculous . 
  austerity handles the deficit problem . 
  it does not promote growth . 
  troika did not require direct pension cuts . 
  whatever they required is currently in the proposal form . 
  phasing out of ekas , increase in the medical contribution , harsh penalties for early retirement and so on . 
  there are no immense field oils in greece , it 's a myth . 
  there has been research on aegean and ionian sea and they did find some oil there . 
  around $ 20b worth of oil under 30 years . 
  good enough for some pocket change but by no means immense . 
   i just skimmed this and it seems like a full capitulation more or less . 
  how much are you willing to bet that even as they are , the measures will not be found sufficient ? 
  creditor side might say something to the effect of `` it 's a good proposal , but circumstances have changed '' , they 'll probably push for faster application . 
  they 'll also say something to the effect of `` this agreement does not mean we 're going to accept debt haircut , but we 'll be open for talks about debt restructuring < insert date  in the future . 
  http://www.thepressproject.gr/article/78972/live-i-epomeni-mera look down till you come to the big wall-o-text in english . 
  i 've read it , it 's harsher than the previous agreement . 
  basically it 's exactly the same as the creditor proposal but with extended dates in some matters . 
   i thought it was obvious yeah probably .

  this is clearly butter on the liberals ' bread . 
  i just made this phrase up , as a * possible example * . 
  i 'm not defending it . 
  relax . 
   the suicide rates are inflated because of very low population you know , one could attribute the low population to the harshness of the soviet years . 
  you get me know ? 
  now , it 's been ** 180 ** years since we gained independence . 
  anyone who might assume i 'm muslim or that i speak turkish are simply uneducated and i do n't give two fucks about what they think of me . 
  and i would n't be surprised to hear people confusing me for a turk since due to the many years of the turkish occupation we exchanged many cultural ideas , language , genes , whatever . 
  it is natural . 
  now , imagine how much more natural it is for the world to label you as ex-soviet , considering the fact that you left the union ** 26 freakin years ago ** . 
  this is too recent to get overlooked . 
  unfortunately until the era changes and something really serious happens , like estonia leaving eu or the west cooperating with russia etc , you will be considered ex-soviet . 
  other than that , soviet does n't mean russian and to the people who take you for a russian , you should tell them to go fuck themselves , plain and simple . 
  i know you speak estonian and have grandmas and not babushkas . 
  but for the media and for politics it is very convenient to classify your country and the rest of the baltics as ` ex-soviet ' . 
  as they do with ` the balkans ' , or ` pigs ' , or ` the nordics ' . 
  people like to name things . 
  especially when the names give political connotations . 
  it is truly unfortunate . 
  because you stopped being a soviet republic ** recently ** , because there is still a schism between russia and ` the west ' and because people like making correlations and forcing generalisations . 
  ` lithuania was soviet so * it is justified * that they 're not happy and have the highest suicide rate in the world , * it is justified * that their economy is unstable and they rely heavily on other eu countries ' an example of a simplified statement about the relationship between lithuania 's current situation and its past . 
  it is oversimplified but not entirely false . 
  of course , it is not entirely true either . 
  it 's a stereotype . 
  it 's not my fault that the world is harsh , people . 
  personally i do n't even use the term `` former soviet republic of lithuania '' or whatever . 
   an illegal occupation does n't change when we became independent . 
  an illegal occupation is one of the few things that determine whether the country is independent or not . 
  that 's because when a country is occupied , that means it 's not independent . 
  edit : grammar, 
  ok then , i see . 
  i do n't want to start a heated argument here . 
  from what you 're saying i understand that it 's clearly a matter of perspective . 
  i mean , you 've been collectivised , heavily militarised , tens or maybe hundreds of thousands immigrated to the west or were deported to labour camps , you went through perestroika and glasnost , and after the dissolution you transitioned to a market economy and you started privatising rapidly . 
  this sounds like an ex-soviet state to me . 
  and there 's nothing wrong with being one , given the progress you 've made since the 90 's . 
  you were * occupied * by the soviets , whether this occupation was recognised or not is a sad detail in the political interest conflict between east and west . 
  but you were being administrated in a very soviet-like style for a long-ass time , and when you regained the opportunity to govern your countries the world was not the same it used to be in the 30 's . 
  this is what i mean by ` new state ' . 
  i completely understand the reasons you dislike the label `` ex-soviet '' and you may be right in demanding to repeal this description , but please do n't tell me you were not soviet because `` it was not recognised by the west '' . 
  greece is not a new state , but an ill one which despite being hella old does n't really know how to govern itself . 
  this is a different story . 
  the difference is that greece is independent since 1827 while estonia since 1989 ( correct me if i 'm wrong ) . 
  you are technically a new state . 
  poland was nazi for 6 years . 
  estonia , lithuania and latvia were soviet republics for more than forty . 
  i know that for most people from the baltics any reference to communism or ussr can trigger angry reactions , but why deny the history of your country ? 
  i mean , it has happened . 
  your administration was soviet for many years . 
  you and 15 more people who upvoted you seriously think tsipras is a communist . 
  a * communist * . 
  please open a fucking dictionnary . 
  that 's right , you 're mixing up hellene and helen :p * helen * most possibly means ` bright ' and is connected to * selene-\u03a3\u03b5\u03bb\u03ae\u03bd\u03b7 * ( = moon ) , although this is still disputed among linguists . 
  * hellene * is disputed too but it is generally accepted that it 's derived from some pre-hellenic language . 
  the meaning is changing constantly through the ages . 
  what is clear though ( for the time being ) is that the two words are not connected , primarily because doubling the \u03bb ( l ) ca n't be explained linguistically . 
  alas , if only such simplistic statements gave answers . 
  fun fact , in greek the word for ` orange ' is \u03c0\u03bf\u03c1\u03c4\u03bf\u03ba\u03ac\u03bb\u03b9 ( portokali ) , and comes from the word ` portugal ' , because it was portuguese merchants who introduced it to the ottoman empire from china . 
  edit : i just looked it up , it 's * porteghal * in persian and * portakal * in turkish too :p, 
  that 's a pretty nice map . 
  i always thought the etymologies of ` sakartvelo ' ( georgia ) and ` t\u00fcrkiye ' were too obvious but turns out i was wrong . 
  it is also speculated that ellada ( greece ) is a pre-hellenic word , from one of the languages spoken here before the indo-europeans came . 
  ukraine 's etymology though : / edit : dear finns , it is said [ here ] ( https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=dxxzosfsium ) ( implied , rather ) that the word * suomi * comes from the finnish word for swamp ( suo ) . 
  is that generally believed ? 
  it 's a reference to the peloponnesian war ( 431-404 bc ) , where athens and its allies fought against the peloponnesian league , a coalition of some greek city-states , among which some islands too . 
  the peloponnesian league was led by sparta ( ancient name : lacedaemon ) . 
  the most decisive battle took plake in syracusae , sicily , and the spartans won . 
  the war is considered one of the most important of the ancient greek world . 
  we have the same percentage as japan ? 
  this is the shock of the day . 
  dude , thanks for this comment .

  i honestly do n't understand why this should be so interesting or awe-inspiring . 
  it 's not like he 's 20 or something . 
  the way i see it is just that people love to name things and the phrase `` the youngest leader in ( enter country 's name ) 's history '' is quite a catchy one . 
  there is no deep or actual meaning ( especially since it does n't reflect to his political views anyway . ),

   the online advantage will help curb many additional costs which essentially means that , when the auctions will take place online , there will be no sabotaging . 
  as of now that auctions are public , syndicates and citizen protection organisations are desperately trying to prevent the despicable sellout of properties which are often the main residence of their destitute owners . 
  even notaries are on strike resisting to cooperate , but it seems that when it comes to strain the poor , there 's always a way , right ? 
  just plain fuck you , i 've got nothing else to say . 
  shame . 
  an economic crisis that was triggered by greek mismanagement and dragged by european officials who had interest in keeping it alive , which is essentially what creates unemployment in greece but surplus of work positions in western europe . 
  like europe is 100 % innocent about the stretching of our crisis , man . 
  yeah , we were completely alone in `` solving '' it . 
  the point is to be able to work in your country . 
  europe is not a federation . 
  i want to work in my country , i ca n't , but you tell me now that i should be happy that i ca n't , because there are other places i can go . 
  seems so comforting .

ok , back to / int / now, 
  hm a mega channel journalist makes a political party and asks us to vote for him . 
  seems totally legit i guess . 
  we need more proof that you 're intending for our good , mr. theodorakis . 
  bring it on and we 'll see, 
  he and his wife ( a failed tv presenter - maestro called evgenia manolidou ) are the modern greek equivalent of louis xvi and marie antoinette , they live in their own bubble and they do n't even give a shit about what happens in the rest of greece i can not even comprehend how many stupid greeks are voting for this fucking idiot since it 's not his first time saying shit like that . 
  they love provoking with their words and they showing their indifference for every single one of greece 's problems . 
  he has even said in the past that the current mp allowances ( which is at most cases ** more than 7000 $ / month ** ) are not enough and they 're barely make ends meet jesus christ , i 'm ashamed of people like these . . and even more now , since he 's an elected member of our `` parliament '' . . 
  afaik gema does n't care whether there is music or not in this stream , they just ask youtube to block them because they assume that at some point the broadcasters might play music which is under copyrights in germany . 
  it 's so stupid , i wonder why nobody has ever try to stop this madness with gema censorship, 
  how about you guys show some good faith and start giving those war reparations to greece ? 
  what ? 
  nooo these are lies , everything is going good , we even have primary budget surplus and the success story of mr. samaras continues ... / s, 
  why is greece in debt ? 
  cause we 're stupid and ignorant , that 's why . . 
  i 'm sorry for what you 've experienced and i really hate it when people are discriminated for their beliefs or even for what music they like . 
  i was listening to metal in my highschool years and some of my friends are still devoted metalheads but i 've never seen anyone bullying them for their choises ( well , except some old grannies who think that metal music was created by satan lol . . ) . 
  police and army officers are total jerks on these matters ( according to my buddy who was a reserve artillery officer ) unfortunately the painful truth is that people are discriminated a lot during their army service . 
  and of course , vandalism and abuse against everybody ( no matter their beliefs ) is totally unacceptable from my part , you ca n't claim you 're a proper christian or person when you treat other people like shit . -  why i blame greek society for the actions of what we call the deep state ? 
  because they knew and saw , and elected to turn a blind eye to everything , even if they pretended to be tolerant themselves . 
  i ca n't agree more with that , you 're absolutely right . 
  also , it 's not only about the deep state , it 's about everything . 
  we were promised a good future from our parents and all we got is our fatherland broken in pieces , infested with corruption and a disgusting greedy political system who only cares about their luscious lifestyle . 
  i just hope we , the younger ones , will be able to fix it somehow . . 
  here 's the thing , facebook is kinda like a community , there 's a difference between surfing on google and see offensive pages and having them appearing in your main page . 
  i do n't recall any other similar instance of selective religious laws enforcement as far as i can remember . 
  still , people in greek cities are more open minded in matters of religious freedom so i consider strange the fact that you 've experienced this kind of problems , unless then you lived in a village or provoked somebody, 
  it 's not about bias , the government enforces these kind of laws selectively for certain reasons , mostly to prevent vote bleeding to gd . 
  as for the said page , it became utterly annoying at some point and it was appearing to my feed mainly from friend 's interactions . 
  telling somebody who disagrees with what was eventually posted in that page to simply log out is n't democratic nor respectful and ca n't be justified with freedom of speech, 
  it 's not my job to enforce laws , but also , according tou our constitution , all citizens are equals before the law , so this applies in both ends . 
  and if you want my opinion , people who defile sacred sites ( just like the ones you mentioned ) should be taken to court , since i respect every other being , no matter his beliefs . 
  still , freedom ends where others begin . 
  i 'm a christian orthodox and the pastitios page was , as i said , a really good way of critisizing the abuse of elder paisios name for profit , bu then , some trolls entered the page and started an endless mockery and disrespecting of christian with every possible offensive way . 
  still , sending a person to jail over this is even worse than blasphemy , to be honest . . 
  according to article 14 of the greek constitution , blasphemy laws also apply for `` every other known religions '' and after all , freedom of religion is a fully constitutional right . 
  now , about dominant religion here , most are identifying themselves as christians , whether or not they got to church every sunday i followed this page on facebook before it was taken down , the founder criticizing the `` paisios '' phenomenon and the whole business behind his name , but soon after the page was filled with trolls and malevolent people who used to mock everything about christianity . 
  of course , sending a man to jail for this is plain stupid and the government should focus on more urgent matters instead of that . . 
  it 's on wikipedia , mate . . 
  eastern attica , there are at least 5-10 cars in the towns around me ( most of them being used by farmers and wine producers ), 
  indeed , it was a really simplistic design based on the 2cv chassis which became really popular here . 
  i still see many of these cars around , since they 're reliable , easy to repair and their not only that , but also nissan had a factory in volos which was closed some 20 years ago iirc , with our then-government pressuring the japanese to nationalize the 50 % of the factory . 
  of course , they did n't succumb to this deal and later on , they closed the factory and left our country for good .

  some of the most notable are : [ ioannis kapodistrias - giovanni capo d'istria ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ioannis_kapodistrias ) [ theodore kolokotronis ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/theodoros_kolokotronis ) [ eleftherios venizelos ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eleftherios_venizelos ) [ alexander ipsilantis ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/alexander_ypsilantis ), 
  you 're gon na be dissapointed , this ai n't youtube or some golden dawn demonstration . 
  because our politicians consider themselves as absolute rulers rather than being elected in their positions . 
  of course , our prime minister is no different since he always wanted to prove himself in front of the rest of new democracy ( especially to those who kicked him out of the party in the early 90 's ), 
  a perfect choice , voting for a party of rich mps that advocate a return to drachma , a move that will cut our gdp by 50 % and impoverish 3/4 of the population , while most of them have their savings in foreign hard currencies ( panagiotis lafazanis , nadia valavani and others ) or have invested in real estate in foreign countries ( dimitris stratoulis , valavani again and others ) yeah, 
  fyi , the colonels regime had a great economic legacy from the democratically elected governments before , in reality they just continued this industrialisation process that got eventually halted by the `` blessed '' socialist andreas papandreou, 
  woah , why so much ? 
  things like that never work out tbh . 
  in our case here , if a homeless person decides to fill his tax papers , he will be charged 300 euros too because the state `` assumes '' that any man or woman living in greece needs a base of 3000 euros per year to live , so you 're supposedly taxed 10 % over this `` imaginary '' sum, 
  in the past , yes , there were many cases and unrecorded incomes have been a traditional problem over here nowadays most people are jobless either way, 
  there 's no such thing over here . 
  what we have is basic taxation on imaginary income you 're a jobless student with 0 personal income ? 
  nah , no benefits of any kind for you , best thing the state can do is to charge you 300 euros for having no income !, 
  \u0391ccording [ to this video here ] ( https://youtu.be/yw8i-ashm24?t=505 ) ( 08:30 ) , this situation was advocated in the macedonian schools at the past . 
  the journalists of the said show are reputable here , so they did n't speak bollocks , but still it was shot in 2007 i think , so your schools might have changed that right now, 
  yeah my fellow european ally , it is offensive at some points . 
  especially when [ the current government of the republic of macedonia literally teaches their own children that this map was a reality ] ( http://i.imgur.com/k5gy1bh.gif ) at some point and greeks have stolen their identity and lands at some point , since they 're not slavs but in fact direct descendants of the ancient macedons . 
  irredentism can be very stupid at times . 
  here in greece especially , it cost us land and blood and this is why we have set it aside for good . 
  greece is the best place in the world as long as you do n't stay for more than 2 months . 
  glad you 've got good time here, 
  ahhh so that 's why sultan recep is building this huge-ass palace to live in ? 
  he did a spectacular race in your very own circuit in 1998 , too , 
  schumi is one of my childhood idols and i never knew he even went to sarajevo to help the children there and witness the horrors of the yugoslav wars . 
  a great man and a great driver he is , for sure . 
  i wish he 'll be ok someday, 
  that trust was breached permanently by the 1974 cyprus events and by the imia crisis of ' 96 . 
  and personally , unless the turkish government decides to back off their nationalistic and imperialistic claims against neighboring nations and understand that the ottoman empire was dissolved 100 years ago and it 's not coming back , i do n't see how our nations will be brought closer ( and before someone tells about the junta and the coup d'etat in cyprus , you must remember that this does n't absolve turkey from the full blown invasion and their war crimes there ), 
   recognize northern cyprus to be an independent nation sure , this will happen the same time eu recognizes the independence of crimea , novorossiya and transnistria . 
  i mean , it 's the same situation over there for an outsider plus recognizing them will be like acquitting the invaders for their crimes, 
  lol syriza 42 % just wait till the new `` reforms '' hit the market and by christmas the most they 'll get is 15 % . 
  either way , greek polls are not to be trusted in general , especially when other polls give the centrist union 3-4 .5 % while this one does n't even mention them, 
  why is that ? 
  only golden dawn and kke ( communist party of greece ) are the only anti-memorandum parties left and none of them is ever gon na get the majority in the parliament . 
  and definitely people understood that austerity is here to stay , maybe forever, 
  nah , not all athens has high rents , but the bills are those that fuck up the family budget . 
  in fact rents have decreased in many areas on the other hand , electricity price has been increased by almost 60 % since 2009 , basic products also have increased prices while wages & pensions have been butchered ( not talking about those with 1000 + euro pension ), 
  then come here and try to confirm this myth you claim judging from bucarest how people live in athens with your only clues being facts you 've found on the internet is pointless, 
  i ca n't be sure if it 's a trollish comment or she 's talking seriously , either way it 's a 3 year post i hope for the sake of all of us she has changed her mind . 
  especially during the last weeks, 
  i 've checked some of his comments , he probably thinks he 's smarter than everyone else in here, 
  sorry lad , check my original message again , i 've translated it , 
  are you pretending to be oblivious ? 
  let 's say you 're gon na buy a product at the price of 100 euros . 
  from these 100 euros , the 23 % of the price , making it 23 euros , are the vat ( it 's 13 % for food related products ) if the seller does n't issue the receipt , it 's like the transaction never happened and he can keep the vat money for himself . 
  if he does issue it , the state gets the 23 % and these are added to the public income , from which you 're expected to get back the money you gave us as loans, 
  the first comment ( by a user called martha ) on the link you 've provided made me cringe edit : loose translation of the comment  so , more expenses for the merchants ? 
   signs , pricing menus , they might even send 1-2 `` good '' guys to fine us because we have n't changed the old with the new menus ( that will depict the message ) . 
  mercy , how much more low can we fall ? 
  personally i 've stopped issuing receipts and even if i wanted to give , everyone of my clients gave them back to me and say `` i do n't want it take it out of my sight '', 
  noted , but only the future withholds the truth on your claim . 
  i have alwayd wished for the best for all my european allies let 's see how the result plays out on tomorrow 's eurogroup, 
  but unlike you , i do n't want to see other people suffering  i 'd even buy you a beer if you were here , even if you told such things to my face, 
  those are not the persons tasked with the voting process , those are probably electoral representatives ( i hope i got the term right ) of the parties , probably antarsya ( far left , currently out of the parliament ) and syriza,

  you ( and me and your theoretical 3rd party ) are not batman . 
  i ca n't think of a simpler example for the meaning of the word ` direct ' , sorry . 
  again , please stick to the content of my posts : 1 . 
  excusing some of the weight of the crime is done by our legal system via softer penalties . 
  no relation to vendettas . 
  it is , they are committing a crime ( killing ) in order to solve an injustice . 
  the key word of my post is `` direct '' . 
  every action we do can have a negative consequence for someone down the line , but you can not predict everything . 
  again not a direct consequence . 
  allow me to clarify with an example ; take the following scenarios : a. i loose my job because my boss deems my services to be expensive b. i loose my job because i am bullied to resign by someone who wants my place . 
  i am not a scholar of right-wing racism towards immigrants , but i think their central problem is the crime related to immigrants ( or at least they think that crime is mainly driven by immigrants ), 
  you can argue that a conscious decision by myself that causes you direct harm , may excuse some of the weight of a possible crime committed by yourself against me . 
  if you commit a crime against me , just because i belong in group a , you do not have the excuse status described above . 
  this is the reason why i group these two extremists together . 
  in your slave-master example , the resulting death of the master by the slave is excused after the abuse of the slave by the master ( conscious direct harm ), 
  i think there is one definition , the one i quoted . 
  if we all have our `` own '' definition ( s ) for socialism ( or for anything else ) , it makes communication difficult , not to say impossible . 
  instead of arguing on authority grounds ( wiki , dictionary ) alone , you can check my definition by applying it to countries and seeing the results . 
  try to find countries that do not fit the description and discuss, 
  hate for their victims . 
  people of other ethnicity for the right wingers , people of other class ( bank employees ) for the left wingers . 
  specifically the hate is not related to the personality of the victims , but their status ( place of birth or type of occupation/pay ), 
  how did you infer this from my statement ? 
  i compare two specific types of crime only . 
  please try to comment the content of my posts , and not the content of what you imagine i think . 
  to answer the question nevertheless : no, 
  neither model of economy ( socialism , free market capitalism ) is implemented as a 100 % absolute rule . 
  in your ussr example , where 95 % of production was state owned by law , how would you describe the economy to an outsider ? 
  us has special laws that forbid privately owned production ( some types of weapons etc ) . 
  would you classify it as a social economy ? 
  not for my morality ( inserted the ` my ' because of the subjective nature of morality ), 
  they are both crimes . 
  the one is racial ( the nationalist flavour ) , the other class ( poor vs rich/other ), 
  my information addition to this thread was that the left is not only destroying buildings as you said in your post . 
  communists are socialists with no sense of humor, 
  i would argue , that if all production is state-run ( by law ) , it is as socialist as it has been practically applied . 
  if a state allows privately owned business , then we are not talking about socialism . 
  my criteria is the explicit exclusion of privately owned business/production . 
  most people mix up `` social benefits '' with a `` socialist economy '' , thus labelling countries like sweden as `` socialist '' . 
  of course , sweden is a capitalist state ( free market ) with very good social policy ( education , healthcare , unemployment benefits , etc ) . 
  but this is reddit ! , your argument is invalid :-), 
  all the terrorist organisations of greece ( 17th of november being the most notorious ) were far left . 
  bank burning has claimed 3 lives in the last 2 years . 
  are you living in the same reality as the rest of us ? 
  it was fine !, 
  now take this party-issued , vacation ticket to siberia . 
  enjoy your stay, 
  no true communism fallacy , how delicious, 
  i think we should rename the `` no true scotch-man '' fallacy , to `` no true communist '' fallacy . 
  ai gamisou malaka * you drop the 's ' because you are addressing the person . 
  at least romanians have an excuse for paying pensions to the dead , for they are the dracuuulllll :-), 
  you can only sell `` commercially viable '' oil . 
  these expeditions are not `` for science '' :-) you can always hope that new technology around the corner may bring you more money , but this is never accounted in future revenues because it is only that : hope . 
  ps : ( thread high-jack alert ) : the deficit for 2011 was about 10bn euros ( excluding debt payments ) . 
  the projected deficit for 2012 is 0-2bn euros and it probably needed the creation of a new branch of mathematics :-) . 
  the projection assumes that the government will receive more taxes this year , in a shrinking economy . 
  no wonder our minister of economics is called `` the wizard '' :-), 
  that is about 25 billion euros according to best case scenarios . 
  given a drilling period of 10 years ~ 2.5 bn e / year, 
  one thing left todo : settle with the politicians that took the money ( but there is law that prevents jail time for them , so why would they bargain ? ), 
  we invented philosophy in order to not use it, 
  tbh , you will pay the biggest part of the bill ( being the bigger economy etc ), 
  adding to the above : greek economy has to fix the trade deficit ( imports vs exports ) . 
  even without debt we run a deficit ( money needed for current year ) . 
  without the bailout , we would go from -5 bn deficit to 0 in one day . 
  this would ` dry ' the market of money , and this money is needed by healthy business to continue growing and exporting . 
  tl ; dr greece got saved from a certain death spiral . 
  whether we work to save our asses completely is up to us ( to be seen ), 
  the discussion is derailed by trying to give a new meaning to socialism in order to include a free market country ( france ) . 
  if france is socialist , i guess every free market country that owns part of the industry is also socialist . 
  a free market country does not exclude the state from doing business but on the other hand a socialist country , by definition , excludes non state-run business . 
  back on topic : awaiting the name of a socialist country that is successful . 
  about owning something : yes you do by definition . 
  what is dirige ? 
  ( non native speaker here ) a government of a capitalist country that taxes for 50 % corporations and individuals , is by your definition socialist . 
  you can not have a socialist-free market . 
  lets try once more : pick a socialist country that does well ( hint : a country in which production is owned and controlled by the state . 
  hint2 : north korea is another one ), 
  industry is state owned in france and i did not notice ? 
  i hope you are not mixing a national healthcare system with a social economy . 
  lets start again , please quote a social country ( hint : venezuela is one ), 
  let 's play a game : name 10 socialist countries that have a good standard of living and i will name 10 capitalist ones . 
  ( i wonder if there are 10 socialist countries still on this planet that have n't gone bankrupt already ) . 
  i wait ... 
  stop scrolling right now fellow redditor , and read the post above . 
  it is long , but informative . 
  the troll is strong with you, 
  the syntax burns my eyes, 
  laos ( far right ) is the only voice of logic at the moment . 
  pasok and nd act like 10 year olds , and the left is living in the 20th century ( dreaming of sputnik probably ) . 
  it may be a saddening fact , but it is the current reality . 
  he seems to have the know-how for handling our crisis , and his credentials are good . 
  his government will have to vote some very unpopular measures , and it remains to be seen if the two major parties will step-up to the task . 
  the imf lie is the only one that ( a thinking person imo ) would agree to being said ; here is why : if your pm tells you that your country can not sell bonds to the open market and that he is in talks with the imf for a loan , you run to the bank without thinking twice about it . 
  if the deal is not successful --  country goes bankrupt --  your bank goes bust --  goodbye saving account ( amongst other nice things ) . 
  final point : if we have n't lied about our total debt and our deficit , it would have been impossible for us to get more loans , and get so deep into debt . 
  alogoskoufis , increased the reported greek gdp by 30 % in order to qualify for a bigger loan . 
  of course this meant that we were eligible for smaller eu support grants ( we reported that we got rich after all ) , and we had to increase our contribution money to the eu in support for weaker countries . 
  fun fact ( google it ) : this action by alogoskoufis , got the 2nd place in that year 's economic errors : 1st place was kazakstan with a typo on its currency . 
  whoever they choose , he/she must be voted by the current parliament members of nd , pasok - hence coalition .

  anyone who does n't blame the germans has an inferiority complex . 
  he is a self-hater too , right ? 
  i have a group of people like you following me around and talking shit because their pride got hurt . 
  to be honest , you have the country you deserve , and the politicians you deserve . 
   it is n't , but either are tied to each other . 
  that is what you morality says , not reality . 
   i 'm more curious wether you realize there 's a difference between population growth , and a near 50 % population reduction in an average human lifetime . 
  so , do you ? 
  50 % population reduction ? 
  is that before or after aliens abduct us ? 
   it clearly does because otherwise they would be already bankrupt because of all the shit they have done . 
  thanks to austerity they could have been recapitalized . 
  your money paid for their mistakes . 
  it does n't benefit them and even your argument shows that . 
  while it is great to be bailed out it is obviously not as great as having a healthy economy or just higher interest rates . 
  this current situation benefits no one . 
  it 's just that the banks avoided the brunt of the blow . 
  i 'm sure that everyone would have preferred for the crisis to not have happened at all . 
  population growth is not the same as economic growth . 
  this is just conservative moralizing disguised as economics . 
  you realize the population ca n't keep growing , right ? 
  i mean eventually you have to stop pumping people into the planet , there is a natural limit - if you want to maintain your quality of life , that is . 
   like in greece where the cheap money they got before the crisis ( and for greece , to loan money suddenly became way cheaper than before entering ) was n't used for structural reforms or was used to create any real value within the nation , but rather to make election-presents in from of an overloaded goverment thanks for pointing this out . 
  i do n't know why most of / r/europe and pretty much 100 % of greeks ignore this . 
  but no , blame it on the germans . 
  it worrying because people are not aware how bad greece fucked up . 
  they think everything was going great and then the germans came in and ruined everything . 
   in regard to morals , christian institutions have been at the forefront of advancing humanitarian and social progress for the last millennia and that can be readily proven . 
  maybe but morals are something else and are also not shared by everyone . 
   destruction of the family unit and negative birth rates are probably the most concerning . 
  like above , this is highly subjective and there is not a measurable thing to be concerned about . 
  it is a purely ideological or rather metaphysical matter . 
  edit to clarify i mean that it is based on the christian religion regarding the conservative family unit as `` sacred '' . 
  other family kinds ( like a family with gay parents ) are treated with utmost contempt and hostility even if there is no objective reason to consider them wrong . 
  same goes for birth rates . 
  in the eu , if current trends continue and if zero immigrants arrive , we 'd still have [ 400 million by 2080 ] ( http://appsso.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/nui/show.do?dataset=proj_13npzms&amp;lang=en ) which is a absolutely huge number - even if we only look at it historically . 
  but christians consider breeding as `` sacred '' too , so any slowing down of the overpopulation our planet faces is considered `` wrong '' for purely metaphysical reasons . 
  ah typical brexit hysteria, 
   i would argue it is one of the last entities holding it together . 
  this does not make sense based on how the world works . 
  the less religious we became as a species , the better off we have become . 
  now you can argue correlation and causation , but the point is that if christianity `` holds the world together '' then we must have definitely have seen * some * unraveling by now considering how weaker christianity is . 
   nearly all the early scientists were christian as well as many of our great political theorists . 
  they could n't be anything but christians . 
  for most of christianity 's history , not being a christian was social or even real death . 
  atheism may be sociably acceptable today , in some cases , in the liberal parts of the western world . 
  but this is very recent phenomenon . 
   in terms of humanitarian outreach they have also been unrivalled in raising the human condition . 
  like worshiping poverty like mother theresa or discouraging the use of condoms in aids-striken countries ? 
  science and technology have raised the human condition . 
  material wellbeing , health , wealth and entertainment ca n't be attributed to religion . 
  religion is the institutionalized worship of beings and concerns itself with spiritual ( and thus non-material ) matters . 
   christianity is at the very core of western civilization the west is culturally christian . 
  but the core of our civilization is not religion and magic , but the enlightenment . 
  the enlightenment is not synonymous with christianity . 
  as a movement , it has more to do with reason and logic and questioning tradition than blind worship . 
   our core freedoms and values originate in its essence . 
  our core freedoms are political in their origin . 
  we do n't have freedom because we share some metaphysical belief but because of social contracts and laws . 
   \\  force them to learn greek and convert to orthodoxy this should be a war crime, 
  says the guy whose country voted for brexit , the irony is pretty amazing , please go on , 
  you need to rethink your priorities too ... if you think that having * magic * as a pillar of your society is not embarrassing . 
  good that a brit like you is here , to tell me what is best for greece . 
   why did we stop calling them fascists ? 
  because right wingers are crying that they are being `` mislabeled '' and thus we ca n't use the word anymore , not unless you can bare to read 100 pages of right wingers whining at you about how oppressed they feel at online forums . 
   try not to make assumptions i was n't . 
  read again my post . 
  but nice of you to assert that you are a special snowflake anyway . 
   i think it 's lazy to blame european instability on the right-wing . 
  no , the right has a vested interest on european instability , the more divided the people are , the more votes they solicit , as anyone who does n't live under a rock has seen this past decade . 
  username checks out yes , the eu is this malevolent entity with tentacles , that hates national sovereignty and wants to destroy the proud national cultures / s, 
   stop sticking your head in the stand . 
  this is the default right-wing reaction : we did n't create the syrian civil war , it 's not our problem , etc. 
  well lets see whose problem it is in a couple of decades . 
  the right has been undermining european stability by torpedoing each and every plan to handle the situation . 
  their narrow-minded goal of quickly cashing in votes from the frustration will be destructive for all of us . 
  it does n't make sense politically because literally every greek person alive ( and probably some dead ones too ) would lose their shit over it . 
  there is absolutely no way this can happen in greece . 
  i agree that it would be good for the country but the people ( and thus the politicians ) will simply not have it . 
  this is a new complaint . 
  it 's usually the exact opposite , why are people ignoring the nationalists ? 
   what what ? 
  lol do you really want an answer to this ? 
  just google it   russia is rich compared to those central asian counties and is getting many asian immigrants to the benefit of the oligarchs who could always use more cheap workers . 
  so having foreign workers in your country makes you a globalst ? 
  interesting . 
  it is my understanding that russia is fiercely nationalistic and the ruling party is very protective of their nationalist culture . 
  i do n't think letting in workers will suddenly turn russia into a progressive or liberal ( or whatever else means `` globalist '' these days ) state . 
  putin would never have it , nor would his successors . 
   but there are also people who no longer have anyone who represents them . 
  i get that . 
  but i do n't think its an excuse . 
  why ? 
  because this is n't a feeling unique to right-wingers . 
  many people do n't have a political platform that represents them 100 % . 
  this should n't be an excuse to vote for the most ( allegedly ) anti-systemic or anti-pc candidate . 
  i do n't have anyone in greece who represents me either , should i just go `` fuck it '' and vote for golden dawn ? 
  does that make sense ? 
   when the left stops caring about the life of the native population , where do you go ? 
  you do n't go anywhere .

  that 's how you know these people are retards . 
  no sane government should call a referendum on eu membership at least over the next 2 years . 
  there is something to celebrate today . 
  we ( both sides on the argument on the eu ) now have the best thing we could ask for . 
  exhibit 0 : great britain . 
  finally !, 
  a country that is going to leave the european union , and set a precedent for leaving !, 
  just wait and see how is that working out for them , and whether the process and the prospect of exiting the european union is worth it for countries already in !, 
  you dont get it . 
  that 's all the tories ever do . 
  what is even a tory without the eu ? 
  the church has no real power though . 
  they have some influence , more to do with history and culture , than actual religion , but that 's not the same thing as power . 
  i am greek , and atheist , and i do n't see any issue with the dominant position of the orthodox faith . 
  priests have my respect , even . 
  i think it is great that some members of the public have the urge to live a life of piety and service to others in priesthood , and i would n't want to deter them from doing that by taking away their salary which they have enjoyed for centuries . 
  especially since the state really benefits from their services , and from church property , and from all the ecclesiastic tourism they bring in . 
  i think its mostly to do with the deal with turkey . 
  because one day when erdogan threatened the eu to end that deal , a lot ( like ten times more than usual ) of refugees crossed . 
  when asked why they told the authorities that they hoped that they would not be returned back . 
  the closing of the balkan route sure helps deter economic migrants who want to go to countries with generous welfare , but it does n't really deter refugees , whose primary concern is safety , from getting to european soil . 
  so we need both . 
  both borders closed shut , and the deal with turkey . 
  it was deliberate . 
  tbh , i do n't blame this man that much . 
  for all that poor man gets affected by laws that squeeze his income , and listens to his mp taking part in constant debates in parliament regarding the issue and sees eu bureaucrats visiting all the time and demanding those things from the government , it 's not really shocking that he believes that the eu is somehow causing this , or at least perpetuating this ... to be fair , the situation is pretty unprecedented , before the debt crisis , the last time greece defaulted on its debt was 1932 , so these things had n't come up since the great depression , generations ago . 
  people just are n't economists that study these stuff , the cause and effects of fiscal policy and borrowing , these are foreign concepts to most people . 
  so to the average person who watches the news , it really does sound like the eu is demanding them to pay more tax , and get paid less than people in other eu countries . 
  we made them , we can always change them ... 
  ca n't wait to ask germans if the berlin airport is ready . 
  i just vomited from my eyes . 
  this campaign is calling its enemies project fear . 
  this campaign !, 
  were you unfortunate enough to visit during strike season ? 
  oh wait i forgot , strike season is the only season . 
  dammit !, 
  somebody thought of this before me !, 
  ; _ ; i never get the good puns ... 
  better than nothing , but still not remotely as good a should be . 
  hello , 
   why did it take so long ? 
  \u00af \\ _ ( \u30c4 ) _ / \u00af honestly it 's probably because it 's hard to justify , let alone sell to taxpayers , the cut to benefits in times where people depend on benefits to survive . 
  the problem with greece is that we were the first to crash and the mechanisms to deal with that crash were n't there yet . 
  it took the longest to deal with our crash than in any other country . 
  in cyprus , ireland and portugal the necessary things were done much quicker as the lifes of people had n't been affected much from the downturn and there was still political will for reforms . 
  here there was none of that , from day 1 . 
  something like : get reforms in as fast as possible to secure bailout funds as early as possible to return stability to the economy , privatize a whole bunch of unused assets the greek government has at the cheapest possible so that the people who buy them actually invest and create jobs , downsize the public sector and replace the numerous and complicated current benefit schemes with a minimum guaranteed income to save on administrative costs . 
  if the economy grows to the point that we can reach it , why should n't we ? 
  i am not a registered member of any party but i voted for nd in the elections of september 2015 . 
  i think they had the most honest manifesto in that particular election . 
  syriza is n't that bad . 
  they did a good job reforming pensions , they absorb almost 100 % of the money the eu throws at them where previous governments got less than half of that , and they have received more money from tax-evaders than what all governments from 2000 did combined . 
  and i think they have a much better rhetoric altogether , they do n't pretend to like the bailout as previous governments did . 
  they acknowledge that , its something that 's being forced on us , rather than something that we believe should happen . 
  and even though political analysts will tell you that 's a terrible strategy , and it kind of is , i personally would much rather have a government like this . 
  i did n't even voted for syriza and i find them at least equal in good and bad to the previous governments . 
  [ i have never seen a better image that drives the point for the salamis strait bridge ... 
  ever . 
   richest and the most influential one is russian church that 's not so true . 
  consider this : of the 14 orthodox churches , 7 are greek ( and by that i mean they are 1 church in all but name ) . 
  these are : the church of greece , the church of cyprus , the church of antioch , the church of alexandra , the church of america , the church of jerusalem and of course , the ecumenical patriarchate of constantinople . 
  all are greek for historic reasons . 
  they basically are 7 churches with a single clergy . 
  collectively these churches account to fewer worshipers than the russians , but to approximately a billion times more money and influence both political and in matters of the church . 
  and what 's really hard for the russians , is that with the exception of the church of antioch , the other 6 churches are pretty much always in line , because they are one group in all but name . 
  add up the fact that romanians , serbs and the albanian archbishop are also close with this block . 
  add up the fact that this block is ok with the catholic church and the catholic church is ok with it , which russians hate . 
  ... and you can see why russia generally dislikes religious meetings in the orthodox church . 
  [ this is literally what 's happening ] ( http://i.imgur.com/4ogcwyv.jpg ), 
   step aside greece k, 
  bruh , i do n't know ... no wars ? 
   not to mention that the sub has the eu flag on it that 's the flag of all of europe . 
  not just the flag of the eu . 
  actually our government was relying on that deal to get turks to visit greek islands since the demand has surged lately . 
  expect a deal with the greek government soon where you should be able to travel to the islands visa free for like 10 days . 
  that 's probably only going to be for lesvos , chios , rhodes , samos , kos and kastelorizo though ... 
  the things we , and by that i mean greek nationals although i am sure this is the case for all scenghen nationals , can visit turkey without a visa already , for like ... decades . 
  i do n't see how it 's the same . 
  you should , especially istanbul . 
  it 's pretty cool :3, 
  jesus christ dude , milk !, 
  yeah , pretty much everyone is an entitled little shit . 
  but this is the story in other european countries too though . 
  it 's not a problem unique to greece . 
  we are n't . 
  but unlike the other western countries , we truly get eastern europe . 
  we were born in it , molded by it ... 
  exactly , that was the plan , and of course we had to veto that . 
   if you allow us to defend your borders on our terms as well , then we 'll share responsibility as well . 
  who is `` we '' and what are your terms ? 
  to not rescue people inside our maritime border ? 
  to drive back or even attack boats full of people ? 
  to then deprive people of their right to identify themselves and request asylum ? 
  there is no such thing as having saying in it , or terms . 
  members of the schengen area should n't even have national border controls . 
  our coastguard should be the one that do the rescuing , as under our constitution they are obligated to follow international and domestic law of the sea , and these are our territorial waters after all . 
  then , the rest of the border controlling , civilian or otherwise , as well as processing asylum applications , should be done by bodies directly controlled by the european commission . 
  thankfully that 's what the schengen treaty says should happen . 
  unfortunately many countries have lobbied against expanding the eu army ( which already exists btw , it 's not a new thing ) and coastguard for decades !, 
   greek borders they violate , greek shores they land on , greek city 's they stay in .

  some major economic events in the last 60 days which might have influenced this decision [ multi-billion dollar project set to transform old athens airport into global destination and being developed by the richest greek on earth ] ( http://www.pappaspost.com/multi-billion-dollar-project-set-transform-old-athens-airport-global-destination/ ) [ `` chinese prime minister visits greece june 20 , sees greek shipping harbor piraeus as `` gateway into eu '' for chinese goods . . will make piraeus/thessaloniki harbors `` the most competitive port in the world .

  i agree , tsipras is for the complete idiots who voted for pasok in the 80 's / 90 's . 
  i respect samaras because he is aggressively targeting foreign and domestic investment . 
  2 weeks ago china and greece signed a 10 billion a year contract to transform two shipping harbors in greece to cosco european headquarters and also greek exports to china contracts this week samaras got the richest greek on earth to sign a 5 billion $ deal to transform old athens airport to a worldwide holiday destination . 
  this year he also signed 3 natural gas pipeline deals and tons of more things . 
  tsipras is a communist who wants to destroy greece , a sleeper agent of the elite . 
  . samaras actually fights for greece, 
  greece just signed a potential 10 billion a year chinese-greek shipping deal 2 weeks ago when prime minister of china visisted . 
  two shipping ports in greece will be the `` gateway '' of chinese goods into europe and the most competetive ports in the world accoring to chinese pm . 
  greece is in process of building 3 major natural gas pipleins that will supply the eu with 40-50 % of natural gas for the next century . 
  and this week the greek government got the richest greek on earth , latsis , to sign a 5 billion euro contract to turn the old athens airport into a worldwide holiday destination the next 5-6 years will be very lean years but by 2020-2022 there will be a major economic push with these new economic assests so there is something `` going for it '', 
  `` he held the gate '' :(, 
  putin fears maidan of ukraine more than anything else he fears this beacuse he sees the possibility of a `` russian maidan '' happening in moscow , thus what he is accomplishing is forcing the russians to view ukraine and especially the maidan movement as the `` enemy '' . 
  one to be destroyed and read in future russian history books as the ultimate evil when you try to usurp the establishment government . 
  like tacitus said , it is about sending a message not only to neighbouring countries to not leave russian sphere but also to russian citizens . 
  [ u mad ? 
  ] ( https://warosu.org/data/vr/img/0015/16/1396888117306.jpg ), 
   plans for the 65 million square foot land include one of the biggest parks in the world , top sports facilities , one of the largest aquariums in the world that will celebrate and preserve greek oceanic life , an upgraded coastal front and a residential tower called `` one of the tallest in the mediterranean '' by organizers . 
  very exciting to see this , 
  hows the weather in nigeria ? 
  when it comes down to it . 
  . the current system of `` never-ending growth or death '' capitalism is bound to collapse . 
  it is impossible to always grow as resources are becoming more and more limited . 
  something has to eventually give , and it looks like the stage is being set for the `` big one '' . 
  it is not a coincidence that every western government is passing all these laws and measures to militarize the police and control internet with `` terrorism '' laws . 
  its going to get very very ugly soon . 
  the craziest thing is how he is obviously grooming his son ( who look like joffrey baratheon ) for leadership . 
  so does the collapse happen first and then the banking union ? 
  or does the banking union happen then the collapse ? 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/glass%e2%80%93steagall_legislation banks stopped being banks and ended up becoming huge corporate casino 's, 
  1984 was n't a manual uk government , it was just a damn book !, 
  so golden dawn is also a `` far-right '' political background . 
  not nazi 's right ? 
  i do n't give a shit if ukraine uses those with `` far-right political background '' ( who happen to use nazi symbols , ideology of supremacy and nazi salute ) . 
  but this will cause unforseen consequences in the future . 
  let 's say that things somehow do calm down and people return home , and then watch on russian tv 24 / / 7 how nazi 's literally came to their village and killed people . 
  this will cause a 2nd uprising . 
  then a 3rd , then a 4th . 
  etc you fell into putin 's trap by using those with `` far-right political background '', 
  from the videos ive seen of the actual battles being filmed by the dutch forces themselves . 
  they looked absolutely out of their depth . 
  i can not blame them personally , there was literally a hell of mortars and gunfire around them and they were not trained well enough to deal with it and not enough manpower/equipment . 
  i could be wrong but that is the sense i got from the videos ive seen as they were filming the surrounding battles . 
  ofcourse not . 
  these are the same people who sent entire battalions of neo nazi 's to go kill russians in the east . 
  [ neo-nazi azov battalion take oath in kiev under wolfsangel flag ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgxvo6gf_fs ) [ neo-nazi azov battalion fighting in mariupol around 2 weeks ago ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9jitrxfoce ) [ neo-nazi right sector battalion fighting in front-lines of donbass this week ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kncihoqqjik ) i understand ukraine needs to fight the rebels . 
  . but when you send hardcore nazi 's to do your fighting , something is very fucking wrong poroshenko is proud of these men as you can see here [ poroshenko in radas is saying how glorious ua army is crushing the seps . 
  some woman shouts `` our army is killing children ! '', 
  for which he replies `` no one criticizes our army ! '', 
  smacks the desk and gets a standing ovation ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkqe9igopy ) edit : nice downvotes for showing the truth . 
  keep on downvoting idiots, 
  i agree that tourism is not something to be really `` proud '' about as far industry , but tourism has massive benefits as it provides a stable income for millions of greeks who have small businesses . 
  the greek tourism minister has made an official goal to increase tourism 10 % every year and she has hit that goal 4 years in a row since making that statement ( which was ridiculed at the time ) greece has potential to bring in around 30-35 million tourists by 2030 and that is the goal , if greece hits that it will be amazing for the economy . 
  tourism not only raises the greek economy , but shows that greece is a safe and stable country . 
  which foreign investors crave for . 
  the increased tourism and stability the last few years is why the emir of qatar decided to buy 10 uninhabited islands near ithaca island to build massive luxury palaces to rent out to `` ultra-wealthy '' celebrities/elite from around the world . 
  ithaca island is getting a part of the island turned into a `` mini-monaco '' . 
  . all this has happened in 2014 with increased confidence in greece . 
  greek tourism minister is also heavily targeting the `` ultra-wealthy '' tourism sector in multiple levels . 
  bt like you said , tourism is not something you can always depend on . . which is why these shipping/energy deals are so critical and will make greece economy something to respect by 2020-2025 . 
  greek government is actualy being smart , which is why i support samaras . 
  in early 2014 he passed into a law that made 10 % of all future gas profits , potentially trillions go into a science research fund and 90 % of profits go intoa `` norway style gas fund '' and he hired the same norway team that made theirs . 
  greek government is actually acting like a real government for once in modern greek history . 
  . instead of a byzantine corrupt beraucracy, 
  `` greece prefers civil war '' . 
  where the fuck is the civil war ? 
  greece has gone through a great depression nearly 30 % worse than the great depression in usa during the 1920 's . 
  and the worst thing to happen was a riots in athens square between hardcore political extremists in 2010 eu studies have shown that greeks work the longest hours in the eu for the least amount of benefits , the least amount of social security , the least amount of medical aid and care , the least vacation , least job security and least protection in europe . 
  and then we have romanian idiots like yourself talking shit . 
  greece has taken this entire crisis with the absolute most amount of grace you possibly could . . no other country on earth would have been so peaceful as greece has the last few years , none . 
  watch what happens in a few decades when the northern economies start to crumble and they will my friend . 
  there will be wars and massacres . 
  greece has posted a primary surplus in 2013 and the first 5 months of 2014 greece has posted a primary surplus four times the amount set by the troika . 
  greece is set to start growing again in 2014/2015 and will be exponentially growing from here on as we are hitting record numbers of tourists every year with 22 million expected this year ( 2x greek population ) . 
  .3 pipelines in development with one the igb pipeline set to make greece a exporter to romania/bulgaria . 
  . the other two the tap and emp will make greece the energy hub of the eu by 2020 when the pipelines are complete . 
  greece signed massive shipping deals with chinese cosco shipping company , transofrming piraeus and thessalniki harbors into the `` gateway of china into europe '' . 
  multi-billion euro deals were signed last week with china for greek exports to china . 
  we have taken this crisis . 
  . struggled like nobody else . 
  kept our pride and no wars happened . 
  and finally going to transform our economy into a 21st century one . 
  you should be worried about romania . 
  your country has made absolutely no progress in any sector the last decade and still has a 20th century economy . 
  hopefully you will learn from greece when you see how it has changed massively . 
  it will take a few years to truly see the radical changes but you will understand fairly soon . 
  darwinism at its finest, 
  why do you think victoria `` pitbull face '' nuland and john `` senile '' mccain visited kiev to rile up the crowd for revolution , when national elections were only a few months away ? 
  then right after that the vice president appointed his son to run ukraine 's national gas/oil company . 
  i feel really bad for ukrainian people right now, 
  if germany does not win it this year . 
  . they never will, 
  their defense is completely lost without thiago silva david luiz is a great defender but he is not smart enough to lead the defense , silva is the key to the brazil team as much as neymar is for the attack, 
  saddest part is that they died for nothing their children and families lost a father just to protect us corporate profits, 
  do n't believe anything coming from that lizard, 
  still needs to catch up to victoria `` fuck the eu '' nuland, 
  last real president was jfk , his murder was a coup by the cia . 
  the leader of cia at that time was george bush senior ... 
  there was also a deathbed confession by a famous cia agent 2 years ago , same agent who stood in trial for watergate conspiracy, 
  marie le pen,

  you guys should n't have created aids , now it 's harder for you to be safe to eat goyim hearts . 
  kosovo is de facto independent , yes . 
  also , kosovo is de jure independent for most countries too , but not for all . 
  which , as a kosovar , you should probably know . 
  both mubarak and morsi became dictators . 
  the difference being that mubarak supressed people along of what they did , even if that was to an extreme level , while morsi did it based on what they * were * . 
  one is clearly worse than the other . 
  you can never change what you are . 
  you can change the way you act . 
  yes , it 's terrible , but still better than morsi . 
  [ yeah , greece had something similar too ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wl6t2ivda9g&amp;ab_channel=%ce%a4%ce%b1%cf%80%ce%b9%ce%bf%ce%91%cf%83%cf%84%ce%b5%ce%af%ce%b1%ce%92%ce%af%ce%bd%cf%84%ce%b5%ce%bf ), 
  that does n't change much . 
  morsi tried to apply extremely suppressing laws towards minorities . 
  he refused to even consider pluralism . 
  the moment he ignored the rights if the minority he lost his democratic legitimacy . 
  he was no less a dictator than mubarak . 
  tried to keep the answer as neutral as possible :p, 
  a ) because they do n't meet ... any criteria for joining . 
  not political , not fiscal ones . 
  nothing , really . 
  b ) because even if they did , we would veto them as we did with them trying to join nato . 
  i think we should heavily fund turkey as well as open large , un-style refugee camps in syria to take care of any emergencies and then take applications from immigrants there with emphasis on the need of those immigrants . 
  for example , women and minority religions are in more danger and should have priority . 
  people with more valuable skills should have priority and so on . 
  i am not for a simple `` dump and forget '' . 
  i also think that people who support the current catastrophic disregard of our laws do not want to properly solve the problem either . 
  i want her to arrest , tie me and punish me appropriately . 
  we expect them to stay in turkey and apply for asylum from there . 
  they are not paid to march . 
  they are paid to riot . 
  my family has a hotel in zakynthos and ... yeah , can confirm . 
  irish are pretty bad at that too . 
  ironically , russians , while they do get drunk , stop at that `` i am too drunk to move but not drunk enough to vomit/pass out '' and then stumble home . 
  go west i guess . 
  bulldog is a strong and independent carry who do n't need no support . 
  yeah , the funny sounding runic speech, 
  but do n't you guys have as an official language that funny sounding runic speech ? 
  why ? 
  many other people here do n't hold the same views as me on free speech . 
  some do n't believe extreme speech should be allowed . 
  i disagree on that . 
  reddit is not a hivemind . 
  i believe in the absolute freedom of free speech , some do n't . 
  some do but believe the law should be applies as long as it is the law . 
  it 's not as simple . 
  she is a fucking scumbag . 
  she should also not have been arrested in the first place . 
  her ideology is toxic dogshit . 
  but she should have been allowed to preach it . 
  i said that in the previous threads about her too . 
  that enough ? 
  great to hear that man . 
  enjoy you new home , 
  you are in cyprus now , no ? 
  do you feel welcome there ? 
  do you like cyprus more than egypt ? 
  sure , experts are good , but in the end of the day , unaccountable experts will just grow corrupt like everyone else does . 
  just because someone is a chemistry instead of a polisci major does n't mean he wo n't do shitty things . 
  being unable to vote them out only worsens the issue . 
   actually , no , you do n't . 
  what you do choose is one of several candidates whose policies are all alike , and neither of whom will be held responsible if the promises he or she gave to you are broken . 
  that 's demonstrably false . 
  simply open the programe of syriza and golden dawn . 
  they disagree on literally everything . 
  as for the broken promises , you can , and people do , punish them by voting them out . 
  for example , the most recent polish elections . 
   yeah , in a perfect system , it is n't . 
  but then , we are not living in a perfect system . 
  corruption exists , of course , but the majority of the money is still used for social ways . 
  else , roads , bridges , social security etc would not exist . 
  their very existence proves my point . 
   and still , every single of these things were created before a form of taxation `` for the greater good '' existed . 
  people created something called `` companies '' for that , in effect investment funds for singular , large-scale projects . 
  the investments then were repaid by means of tolls . 
  large scale roads have never , in history , been created by a private entity . 
  private entities can be hired by the state to complete certain aspects of it but they have never made them privately . 
  never . 
  feel free to prove me wrong by linking a single case . 
   why industry today should not be interested to build roads , bridges or hospitals today ( to improve mission-critical infrastructure ) has never been explained by statists . 
  roads , hospitals etc all multiply their economic cost into profit multiple times over , even in the short term . 
  there are n't just statistics on this ( which there are . 
  enough to fill up libraries worth of data ) . 
  there are literally schools of economics studying the effects of infrastructure on the economy . 
  denying this is paramount to denying evolution or gravity . 
  it 's not up to debate . 
   technically , i do , because i own them , at least a fraction of them . 
  now i did n't run the numbers , but i am pretty sure i own more than i use . 
  why should i have been paying for that ? 
  you do n't own them . 
  the public does , of which you are a part of . 
  the public is a separate legal entity from you . 
  if it was n't , you would n't be able to sue the state . 
  and as a matter of fact , you ca n't access all you pay for too . 
  millitary bases or buildings that concern national security or the pms office , for example . 
   only when they do n't . 
  for instance , which organization is usually the first one to set up shelters and soup kitchens after a cataclystic earthquake in japan ? 
  nope , people would literally freeze or starve to death if they waited for the government . 
  it 's the yakuza . 
  not a singular example , though . 
  who cleaned up neighborhoods after hurricane sandy ?

   hm an american who is posting cluelessly in an european sub what ? 
   while he has left his own countrymen in the shit . 
  crabs in a bucket is not a valid argument either lad . 
  edit :  some history oh , you are adorable . 
  you have no comeback so you stalk someone 's history ? 
  i bet you are really dissapointed you did n't find some wrongthink sub to call me out on , right ? 
  please no low effort circlejerking mate . 
   ofc just letting one nation get destroyed is no problem for the nazis in this sub . 
  yes , it was the nazis that pushed for the quotas . 
  it was the nazis who opened the floodgates with the `` refugee welcome `` s . it was the nazis who wanted the immigrants to come . 
  come on , who are you kidding mate ? 
   the destruction of the eu is the dream of the right wing nationalists here yes it is because the eu is the source of a ton of problems . 
  just calling someone a `` nationalist '' does n't make him wrong . 
  no personal attacks please !, 
  the ones with enough landmass and infastructure that would make them elligible for a refugee camp all are .

  the buck stops at the us , because eu is both an ally and a project backed by the us . 
  can you smell what the rock is cooking , useful idiots ? 
  until we find a way to remove the amygdala and emotional intelligence from everyone on the planet , gestures have value too . 
  the past news i have read indicated that there was plenty of aid given through friendly talks . 
  more countries should join for help , and stricter control applied to separate refugees from opportunist immigrants . 
  send the later back . 
  just simplistically throwing everything to europe wo n't help . 
  being realistic and the way you express your realism makes a lot of difference . 
  a threat tends to make others hostile . 
  maybe that 's what they are aiming for . 
  seriously , was there a need to be antagonistic here ? 
  wtf . 
  if only they scored some points while at the same time not burdening the public or * alliance budget ... 
  why no yurop systems ? 
  they try , it 's just this sub does n't give a fuck , only caring to cosplay nationalism . 
  check the proportion of national-focused news to union ones . 
  putting these countries next to each other without any kind of analysis about culture or their environment is pretty useless . 
  edit : they have china , an enormous industrial country next to them , authoritarian and equally if not more xenophobic , acting as buffer . 
  if you want a better comparison , it 's like having the uk next to a europe overtaken completely by nazi germany or stalinist russia . 
  currently trying . 
  nobody knows why they arrested him exactly . 
  it 's preliminary to call this a tyranny , if they have valid reasons for this that they can not disclose . 
  if you believe the government of a western democracy to be equal with a plantation overseer , maybe you should travel around to different plantations and do a test drive . 
  experience how their plantation overseers treat you , for a change . 
  maybe the point lacked much articulation in the first place . 
  or you are making the same point . 
  the endpoint is that it 's not ok for the dutch government if a dutch goes to the middle east as a mercenary , and i respect that . 
  us , hungary and the netherlands ( to cover all possible points of view ) are all in the [ cjtf -- oir ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/combined_joint_task_force_%e2%80%93_operation_inherent_resolve ) , so there was no excuse for this guy if he went ahead with his trip , even after he got rejected . 
  absolutely . 
  so if i , as `` the people '' , fully support the government in punishing this gung-ho mercenary operating outside the chain of command , they are free to go ahead . 
  satisfied ? 
  if your idea of war is that of an amusement park , then your government does correct by not letting you in the action . 
   but the kurds are the only ones actually fighting isis on the ground you think that this is true , others do not . 
  everything is subject to propaganda , including this . 
  and their government is free to arrest and charge them once they return , if they believe that iraq for kurds goes against the interests of the netherlands . 
  why complain over it ? 
  chain of command , little dutch mercenary , how does it fucking work ? 
  the article does n't mention details . 
  he could be sporting dutch armed forces insignia/claiming he was there in official capacity of the dutch armed forces , which is a crime . 
  really funny that all the far-right astroturfers usually present in immigration threads , are not here to defend the doings of their spiritual brothers . 
  what 's the matter , cat got your tongue ? 
  germany is just the convenient middle manager to throw the blame at . 
  if things escalate , we are going to experience good ` ol freedom ^ \u00a9 . 
  glorious russia has no need of imperialist language . 
  edit : fucking / s , are you people so thick ? 
  balkans still understand the only way to remain free from the influence of paper shufflers in this world : denial of information means denial of power . 
  yeah , the evil marxist media , so marxist they were full of businessmen welcoming the refugees . 
  stop being in denial and get a reality check , competition drives wages down and shuts unions up , it 's all about the top profit . 
  yeah , merkel and the rest of the rich right-wing establishment are * sooo * marxist , you totally got it . 
  learn to differentiate between hardline and light communists for starters , because the former are anti-immigrant and racist just as much as the far-right . 
  or maybe not , we would n't want your far-right ass getting \\ #triggered by realizing he agrees totally with his arch-nemesis on that matter . 
  maybe other people need a safe space . 
  all that angst seems to indicate that their girlfriends were more satisfied with an immigrant . 
  were n't safe to enjoy from who ? 
  because if the ` who ' is us , not being satisfied that china wo n't give us our cheap goods anymore , then you can see the conflict of interest . 
  business vs democracy , as it always was . 
  totally different mate , we are the world 's chosen ones , this was just ` tough love ' . 
  unfortunately , it does . 
  just not for you . 
  the interests of the syrian people are not the same as yours . 
  if only the neckbeard right-wingers were consistent in this approach , when it comes to ` leftist lying media ' . 
    692 upvotes to alleged dn coverup thread , 0 to this one turns out : nope . 
  well , socialism is shitty in engineering form , but perfectly explains how the bottom , poor , low-skilled class of society hates competition artificially introduced by decisions of the top , rich , highly-skilled classes . 
  but hey , let 's not preach evil marxist stuff to the pacified western underclass of triggers and microaggressions . 
  they might repeat the revolutionary mistakes of the past . 
  how do you like dem ~ ~ apples ~ ~ immigrants ? 
  communism was a very good way . 
  but * nooo * , we had to accommodate the poor , triggered eastern countries . 
  it is the two political anti-eu extremes joining forces to bash the common enemy . 
  nothing to see here . 
  * [ putin hand rubbing intensifies ] *, 
  the european commission is n't germany . 
  tabloids will be tabloids , whether polish , greek or german . 
  stupid inflammatory shit to sell more . 
  hey now , lots of options are available , you do n't have to make china the bottom of the pyramid , you can make us and the rest of eastern europe . 
  people are not good in general , because they are proving themselves again and again to not be good , when trusted to be so . 
  it does n't mean they are bad , i just think they simple ` are ' , being hypocritical in order to take things and survive . 
  i do n't know if it is marxist , but yes , i do believe that . 
  the things we enjoy in this part of the world is the result of people in china and other shitholes having no rights . 
  otherwise we would have to pay 10 times more for the things we enjoy . 
  it 's more like a ponzi scheme/pyramid than a zero-sum game . 
  i consider this incorrect , because i do not believe that bad and good acts can be separated . 
  something i enjoy ( good ) was taken from someone else ( bad ) . 
  i do not think i am ` guilty ' because i believe that the natural state of people is to be shitty and hypocritical . 
  if business is like that , it probably explains why i am poor . 
  i always despised bullshiting to people in order to sell them something . 
  i do n't think a george r.r. 
  martin novel is good moral guidance , but to each his own . 
  i only see a shift of responsibility from the government to bank and military industry ceos . 
  more like a transformation than advancement . 
  it 's not possible to make that type of distinction . 
  the government always has the final say , through budget allocation . 
  if they threaten with cuts , the employees within the organization will start a slurping contest to maintain their jobs . 
  there is no such thing as unbiased source of information . 
  no one is innocent . 
  if you want my take on recent development , the only thing that the internet has achieved is taking away control from editors and big corps , instead giving it to writers with very biased views and bloggers that double at cooking as their second profession . 
  any fuckwit with a keyboard can make news out of his ass . 
  if it 's not writer bias , it 's editor bias . 
  if it 's not editor bias , it 's management bias . 
  if it is n't management bias , it 's governmental laws bias .

  interesting but still did n't make it for me . 
  if you have anything better please point me to it . 
  i myself am pretty libertarian . 
  right libertarian though . 
  libertarian socialism never made sense to me . 
  on the one hand you promote individuals and on the other you promote a collective society were things are organized in a communal manner . 
  a communal decision may impact one 's choices , domain etc. 
  a pretty contradictory ideology if you ask me, 
  an pact like this still remains what it is . 
  who broke the deal first is of lesser importance . 
   they argue that america is the policeman of the world cause it 's democratic and free . 
  they argue that the us should be the policeman because no one else can . 
  europe could n't even deal with the kosovo issue without the us . 
   then you have to accept the risk of having china or a dictatorship as the future policeman of the world if it becomes a military superpower that is true . 
  this is why modern nations and their international relationships are based on realpolitik and international realism . 
  unfortunatelly might makes right . 
  make sure to be strong in order not to get stomped . 
   private property wo n't matter because nobody would give a shit about it . 
  not really . 
  private property creates a domain that safeguards your individual liberties . 
  how you use it , where to use it etc. 
  it is important . 
   if you see some research in bonobo and chimpanzee abundance of resources lead to more collectivization and egalitarianism . 
  we are not bonobo . 
  we have come pretty far . 
   we might aswell equate nixon with hitler . 
  nixon was not evil . 
  the dncleaks are way worst than watergate . 
  i am pretty sure you are not willing to equate hillary with hitler . 
   left and conservative are 2 different terms . 
  the leader of our german left-party for instance is also very conservative . 
  true . 
  this is why prager uses truman or jfk in the video . 
  in order to point out leftists that are not like the rest . 
   its only later that it became a `` good vs evil '' fight . 
  what the video argues is how certain people perceive wars . 
  specifics on how it started are another issue . 
   any other questions , you smartass ? 
  like i 'd argue with people giving me that kind of attitude . 
  you are in way over your head . 
   no , if the ussr and germany were allies the ussr would have joined them in the war against the allies people change sides in order to expand their interests . 
  this is what the soviets did . 
  you say they are not credible yet you fail to point out specifics . 
  is anders fogh rasmussen not credible ? 
  is ayaan hirsi ali not credible ? 
  these are people that were part of prager 's work . 
  i find them pretty credible . 
  because they promote collectivist ways of organization and egalitarianism . 
  what i talked about right above was further expansion of individualism and property rights . 
   the ussr was n't allied with germany  they made a pact to partition poland that is what alliance do . 
  deals . 
  there are no broad alliances . 
  only interests . 
  in this video right above us you can watch dennis prager say `` i am not talking about every leftist '' and he uses truman and kennedy in order to point out two left wing liberals that do n't describe what he is pointing out in the video . 
  i find that a pretty reasonable thing to say in order not to generalize . 
  as far as the other videos you talk about . 
  again . 
  point out specifics and counter them . 
  i can argue why i believe the us should be the policeman of the world . 
  everyone went crazy when trump said he would n't be the policeman and everyone was relieved when they heard that trump will intervene ( and intervened ) and broke his promise not to police . 
  with the full automation of the means of production there will be no need for workers . 
  or even less workers if you want . 
  every theory based on worker 's rights will become even more irrelevant . 
  not really . 
  the ussr invaded poland too and was allied with the third reich with the molotov-ribbentrop pact . 
  the west still used the soviets in order to take down the reich . 
  and there were many voices in the american army ( patton for instance ) who argued for the continuation of war in order to deal with the communist soviets too . 
  still not an argument . 
  they bring arguments up . 
  they do n't call you out and say `` the left makes my brain hurt '' or `` left wing lunatics do n't bother with them '' . 
  if you want to counter that you better bring up sound arguments instead of just dismissing them . 
  they have brought people to the show that are certaintly not people that make your brain hurt . 
  people like anders fogh rasmussen , pm of denmark . 
  give them a try and if you do n't like their content criticize it on substance . 
  post scarcity wo n't bring communism because in the west we have this great idea called `` private property '' . 
  post scarcity will lead to the enhancement of private domains and one individual 's life choices and freedom . 
  there will be even less need for egalitarianism, 
  what free market extremism ? 
  every western economy is pretty much a mixed capitalist economy . 
   as for true communism , you have to be a psychopath to hate it . 
  so individualists and people who are not egalitarian are psychopaths ? 
  these debate tactics are so outdated . 
   lenin is as bad as stalin ? 
  you do n't compare evil . 
  evil is evil . 
  lenin said `` there are times when the interests of the proletariat call for ** ruthless extermination ** of its enemies in open armed clashes ''  if the left is overrepresented in academia , is there perhaps a reason ? 
  conservative people tend go into business related jobs , management , the army etc. 
   vietnam was a `` good war '' ? 
   what the hell is a `` good war '' ? 
  if you think the the allies were right to attack the reich then you justify wars in the name of defeating evil and preventing further suffering . 
  countries turning into red dictatorships under people like pol pot was a reason for the west to fight a `` good war '', 
  people attack prageru for being conservative . 
  how is that even an insult ? 
  it would be way better if you people who disagree argued on the basis of the contents of the video and the things said in it instead of just going `` lol prager downvote '', 
   with one being a economic system yea i am pretty sure class hatred and worker 's revolution are theories based on the grounds of economics . 
  a step in the right direction . 
  so an island with a [ greek population ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3c/ethnographic_distribution_in_cyprus_1960.jpg ) ( greeks on the island during the 1960s ) wanted to unite with the rest of greece and that is somehow ... illegitimate ? 
  makarios was considered by the americans and the brits as the `` castro of the mediterranean '' . 
  henry kissinger gave the ok for his overthrow by other greeks . 
  the turkish government just pulled a crimea before it was cool .

  brazil ? 
  ah , yes . 
  i read that a lot of them also fled during the revolution towards syria since they were scared about their religion . 
  are there turks in crete ? 
  til, 
  that wasnt reproduced the same way as the muslim versions . 
  your statements are correct though . 
  my point was that if you come to a place with christian people and you start drawing a jesus having sex with stgeorge 's dino crocodile , you gon na get assaulted . 
  you underestimate that a bit i think . 
  well , third political power is pretty high for greek standards . 
  also keep in mind that the traditionally centre-right , has gotten a lot more just-right/far-right from 2009 ( getting people from small time far right parties/ex-junta supporters/ex-golden dawn members etc ) , so that draws some votes . 
  even today in greece we see that . 
  they are not latinos , or germanics , or slavs . 
  so , that is reflected in their language . 
  the funniest shit is when you serve a beer to a british person and he says : i dont want the foam , i am not german !, 
  ( said as if `` german '' is an insult ) , to the polar opposite : germans laughing at beers which are not at least 25-75 foam-beer ratio and calling them `` apfelsaft '', 
  do you think they would put that on their frontpage ? 
  you should see what they have to say about gays and other stuff . 
  you know the things that you would n't see in their tv ads . 
  not even they know what they are . 
  wow benedict pic looks like a goth metal album cover . 
  creativity is not about art necessarily, 
  dunno , the knowledge i got from school really kicked off my creativity . 
  no he is not, 
  le persecution, 
  damn he really tries with the accent, 
  lol kittens , we are so corrupt , even the measurements of corruption would be affected, 
  we also have a german bayonet from ww2 . 
  who 's home ? 
  tbf the uk has survived worse stuff . 
  you mean the english sovereignty or the uk sovereignty ? 
  not if you have a variety of accents, 
  ah , straight through the river !, 
  excellent choice . 
  california vs texas ? 
  denying support or actively supporting is the `` being involved '' ? 
  well , the usa can still make a request , and greece can still deny support . 
  they are below see level and i am making a joke about that . 
   center-left is nonexistent , center-right has been reduced to pretty much nothing , the far-left is a bunch of dreamers who either only care about getting a job ( and shitting on their voterbase ) or have really utopian ideas ... the far-right is ... on the whole economy/social aspect of things they 're pretty much left but the whole family feud and omnipresent racism towards our own citizens ( not even migrants who might or might not be a threat but french citizens born in france who actually care about their country ) is a huuuuuge turn-off . 
   idk ... who else could i vote for ? 
  hunting , fishing and traditions ( yes that 's a real party ) ... maybe the royalists ? 
  :d holy shit you just described greece ( even the party of the hunters and the royalists ), 
  denmark : flat bike country . 
  like the netherlands , but they are not drowning and they call their dijks `` bridges '', 
  which one, 
  that 's 1:100 ... holy shit ... 
  what 's german, 
  why would my money hate you ? 
  nothign whatsoever . 
  if anyone tells you something about crete he is lying !, 
  do quebecoisie count as latin americans ? 
  ^ ^ it ^ ^ was ^ ^ cool , ^ ^ unlike ^ ^ mine, 
  just dont take our hands, 
  they can be irritating . 
   not-yet https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_union, 
  sony ericsson k700i . 
  that thing was rambo . 
  edit : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sony_ericsson_k700, 
   is clearly not for the benefit of the germans . 
  i dont think that it was made to benefit the germans or anything , but they for sure got benefitted ( is that a word ) by that . 
  what would a clever move be ? 
  i am not an expert , but , in 2008 the americans did a qe and they still havent seen any serious inflation . 
  only reduced unemployment . 
  it took the ecb to 2015 to do the first limited qe . 
  that 's 7 long bureaucraticly slow years . 
  the attitude of `` leave it to the national goverments '' by eu , is shit . 
  from clever monetary policy . 
  not the ecb working for germany etc. 
  \\  ball, 
  it 's not about being white , it is about being relatively close . . 
   rakimelo is particularly good rakomelo * . 
  ( i am glad you like it ), 
  i live ways off kavala ( or bulgaria ) :p . i understand what you say that for large groups , it is gon na cost less for each person , i mean , makes sense right ? 
   very high number of romanians that go on summer holiday in greece i work at hotels every summer and i have seen a total of 2 families ( 7 people ) . 
  thats what i thought until i saw the last pic, 
  that 's what i have problem with, 
  raki doesnt turn white with ice ? 
  you really confused me now ... 
  interesting as fuck, 
  what magic is this, 
  so , that 's the whole deal ? 
  i am glad your standard for public trains is that high guys . 
  good on switzerland . 
  as for the others , prepare for anschluss !, 
  what is this pic from ? 
  i see it often . 
  god bless eukalyptus, 
  1 . you hunt to eat , not for entertainment 2 . you try to make the animal suffer as least as possible 3 . you dont cause ecological damage these 3 things are a no-brainer and i am glad you got them covered . 
  the one point i want to raise is this : to whom do these whales * belong * ? 
  it is the same as hunting birds . 
  do these birds belong to you so you are allowed ( morally or legally ) to make them your food ? 
  also , just because it is legal in faroe , it doesnt mean that we have to accept it and not scrutinise it . 
  on the other hand , i do feel that all the criticism might be overextended because whaling has a bad stigma ( mostly because of the japanese ) . 
  oh well what can i tell you . . it 's not like i know 100 % insight in gun smuggling :p, 
  by fake i mean not russian , ua , etc, 
  in pakistan and bangladesh , people make fake kalashnikovs which they sell in the black market ( good ol' traditions since the british empire , alongside heroin ) . 
  they cost about 1.5 k $ . 
  maybe they find their way to brussels ? 
  well , height must come into play aswell, 
   i almost did n't see anyone who was overweight how do you define overweight o.o,

  no , uk could not act what happens when a uk jet gets shot down by russian anti-air ? 
  would you really risk the potential of world war 3 right now ? 
  also , if uk/us/nato goes in then it would drive tens of thousands of ethnic russians living in ukraine and russia to sign up to fight them within hours . 
  you would have to enter with a full-scale invasion force, 
  so does greece though, 
  sorry , it was 10 % drop with 15 billion in losses http://www.ukrstat.gov.ua/operativ/operativ2014/fin/chpr/chpr_ed/chpr_ed_r/chpr_ed_0114_r.htm, 
  http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=0ae_1405699122 you are correct , the civilians were killed by shelling as you can see by the damage in surrounding area . 
  i do n't think war is ending any time soon . 
  videos being uploaded now show the civilians were kiled by ukrainian military shelling , ukrainian army is currently storming luhansk and shelling the city http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=0ae_1405699122, 
  ukraine already posted nearly a 15 % drop in gdp for first quarter of 2014 , so this is likely another 15-20 % ? 
  i see , so its different than regular ted conferences ? 
  it should be interesting either way, 
  iraq is going to shit too . 
  greece got ur back polan , if shit goes down, 
  it would be a disgrace for france to go with the sell of those ships . 
  they are a purely invasion ship , meant to rapidly invade foreign land , not for defensive purposes . 
  rip :( i really hope they went unconscious nearly instantly , which is likely the case, 
  they are a mix of thracian ( the ancient people of those lands and enemies of ancient greeks ) , slavs and some greek . 
  there hasnt been such a thing as `` macedonian '' blood since 148 bc you dumb motherfucker in 148 bc when makedon fell to rome and all of free greece with it , this destroyed the city-state rule of greece . 
  over the next 300 years during rome rule , besides the first years which was the roman civil war . 
  was mostly a peaceful time where all the greek city-states actually learned about each other and accepted each other greek race ( there was 4 greek races - doria/ionian/aechean / aeolian ) after rome fell the greek races merged to create the modern greek person and they created the greatest empire known to man , byzantine . 
  pure aechean blood which was the race the macedonians were part of stopped existed nearly 2,000 years ago . 
  the same with pure dorian blood ( spartans ) and pure ionian blood ( athenian ) . 
  they all merged to create the modern greek . 
  1,000 years after the merger . 
  the slavic push came from up north and the people of modern day fyrom came along with it . 
  these people overran and conquered the thracian race , the ancient enemies of greek people and assimilated with them to create the modern fyrom person . 
  modern fyrom is slavic/thracian blood . 
  if you want to say some people from fyrom has greek blood . 
  i am 100 % fine with that . 
  but to say they have blood of a 2,000 year extinct race of greek aecheans ( macedonians ) is insanity . 
  i do n't give a shit if they want to call themselves macedonian as long as they celebrate greek culture and cherish what my greek ancestors did . 
  but to say that alexander was 100 % slavic ( which is what they do ) . 
  that is not going to go well with me or any other greek . 
  that was not their king i could say george washington was the president of greece , and teach that in greek schools . 
  but it still would not make it true . 
  alexander the great was a greek king of makedon and whose descendants united greece to fight against rome for 300 years until greece 's fall in 148 bc to rome, 
  you seriously do n't know ? 
  what the fuck is up with spain and taking pleasure in torturing animals to death ? 
  alexandroski the greatski * please show respect to the great slavic warlord, 
  either way , we are the `` bad guys '' for not accepting their sick beliefs . 
  in this politically correct insane asylum that is modern western world , you need to accept anything everyone wants to be seen as . 
  sorry for not giving two shits when `` macedonians '' are doing the same thing to greece , claiming they are descendants of a 2,400 year old greek king who created the [ hellenistic period ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hellenistic_period ) basically albania is pulling the same thing on them , claiming skopje as their `` historic lands '' . 
  that entire place is like the fucking twilight zone . 
  tourism is growing fairly rapidly , 4 years ago greece received 15 million tourists and now 22 million are expected this year which is a great growth . 
  there is a very high rate of return vacationers who come every year and also tell their friends about their great experience . 
  i think by 2020 , 28-30 million tourists a year could be possible when the athens `` mega-park '' is complete . 
  they are also building a new f1 racetrack near athens harbor , where ultra-wealthy people can park their yachts right up to the race track . 
  hopefully porto  athens happens soon , i am suprised its not already, 
  video of launch - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ka3rhusbf20, 
  cold war 2.0 is in full swing im assuming at this point, 
  you know very little of syria to think that the protest killings is what caused the civil war , it was merely the match that lit the 30 year long fuse . 
  you also know very little to think the fsa was a major player , this is the reason the fsa is largely disbanded , the sucessor of the fsa , the srf ( syrian revolution front ) works alongside nusra in a number of fronts in this war . 
  the major armed groups in this war are isis , nusra and islamic front ( dozens of jihadist groups under saudi control ) . 
  srf is mainly used as a token force to funnel weapons and money to these jihadist groups . 
  for example many of the advanced anti-tank weapons recently given such as the tow have been found in nusra/if hands recently . 
  the syrians were given two options . 
  assad or the jihadists . 
  there never was hope for the `` moderate '' rebels and never will be . 
  the syrians have chosen assad , not because they all love him . 
  in fact many who support him politically , absolutely despise him as a person . 
  but they support him and die for his army because they do not want to see a bunch of barbarians ruling over them .

  i ca n't believe its finally happening . 
  it seems like this whole quest to sell this real estate and develop it has been a decade long story [ canadian credit rating agency dbrs upgraded greece 's long-term credit rating to `` b '' from `` ccc '' ] ( http://greece.greekreporter.com/2014/07/12/canadian-dbrs-upgrades-greeces-credit-rating-to-b/ ), 
  90 % of people who vote for golden dawn are not nazi 's but very anti-immigrant . 
  so in your view , those who are anti-illegal immigrant are not `` normal people '' correct ? 
  greek people are known through-out the world for their hospitality . 
  this does n't mean they can accept a never-ending stream of unwanted illegal immigrants . 
  most of these illegals end up in detention camps and only allowed to leave when they accept to fly back home , they need to understand they risking their lives for nothing . 
  it is not a dogfighter , that is what the f16 is in the 1st stages of a major power war you will need to win a dogfighting air battle first and the f35 is not capable of that . 
  f35 was built to be a missile launcher and drone cloud operator in the sky , not to fight gritty dogfights . 
  the f35 's stealth only lasts until the second it lowers its missile bay and/or fires off a missile . 
  once that missile is loose , it is like a blinking red light on radar and will get a few f16 's on its tail and its history . 
  once air superirity is gained than the f35 truly shines in its role as a `` jack of all trades '' . 
  by 2025-2030 when the `` drone cloud '' system is perfected in the f35 then i will possibly consider it as the superior dogfighter as it can take on f16 with the assistance of smart-drones controlled by the f35 's computer system . 
  this is what will make the f35 truly shine . 
  . and why it is being constantly delayed for eternity . 
  the main goal of the f35 is to be a missile arsenal in the sky while controlling up to a dozen next-generation `` smart-drones '' through its computer system .

  chinese decided on greece due to its proximity to the suez canal since the piraeus deal was made in 2013 , cosco invested around 300 million euros in uprading the port and has already trippled the containers shipped in less than a year . 
  according to chinese reports it has cut the time of delivery of chinese exports into europe by 11 days which is a pretty big deal . 
  the visit last week by chinese pm was to do the same upgrades in thessaloniki port in northern greece and to also sign multi-billion contracts for greek exports to china , mainly in organic food sector but also things like marble and minerals . 
  there was also a deal signed to build a greek `` china-town '' adjacent to the athens airport , meant to boost chinese tourism to greece and to create a nice residential area for chinese immigrants . 
  heretic !, 
  zeus will not take kindly to this claim !, 
  fuck the f35 , that is a pure air superiority jet to get air superiority in the 1st place you need some modern ugpraded f16 's , you can buy almost 5-6 modern f16 's for the price of one f35 in the future when the `` drone cloud '' network on the f35 is running well than yeh it will be the dominant force in the skies , but not before that imo, 
  thank you my german friend, 
  try not to generalize by saying things like `` the greeks '' when referring to a person/persons opinion . 
  i personally think the biggest issue greek small business owners had was the freezing of small business loans after the credit crunch of 2008 . 
  it is only opening up in 2014 with new government projects to boost start-ups with easy access to small business loans . 
  that is just my personal opinion that tsipras represents pasok 2.0 if he somehow wins the next election , greece is fucked . 
  i think that is everybody 's reaction right now,

  that 's because the uk today has a real , efficient , functioning economy , not socialist artificial bullcrap .

  humperdinck humper dinck humper dinck heh that 's an actual name, 
  well , i would n't say it is entirely bs . 
  i mean , when savannajeff and me talk about free trade , we basically completely agree with each other . 
  however , when we talk globalism , immigration etc we are on completely on the opposite scales . 
  i think a more proper way to think about it is that left/right economics is only a part of the equation . 
  i just think of a smug nigel farrage after britain leaves the eu to help me sleep at night .

  he would either lecture you until you gave up or go on a crusade against you . 
  you do n't know his infamous posts in / r/greece so i understand it 's kind of harder to understand without the full context . 
  at some point a few months ago , i became his new target because i became a mod and , horror of horrors , i did n't bent over to him . 
  unlike his previous targets , i do n't let asshats roll over me .

  i think sly is one of the best posters , fullstop . 
  we literally agree on almost nothing and yet he is one of the most enjoyable people to talk to , especially in the irc . 
  savanajeff i also mostly disagree with but , unlike sly , he is uh ... fairly combative . 
  he is n't a bad poster/person but he does get a toxic on occasion .

  i actually have something to contribute here today !, 
  i recently made for an uh ... special other , the following : ** lobster bisque soup ** i used 3 lobsters ( although that was a lot of soup at the end ) . 
  put about 2 inch of water in a large pot , boil it . 
  put some kosher salt in , put in the lobsters for about 20 minutes ( a good rule of the thumb with lobsters is that they are supposed to turn red when they are properly cooked ) . 
  take out the lobsters , keep the water you boiled them in . 
  take out the lobster 's meat . 
  meanwhile , put in a small pot a good amount of butter ( i put like a third of a bar ) , wait for it to melt then put in onions , carrots , cellery , salt ( a bit ) and kayen pepper ( quite a bit ) . 
  when the stuff are soft and melt-y , take them out and put them in a blender along with about a third of the lobster meat . 
  melt them . 
  i filtered the water you boiled the lobsters in . 
  then , i threw the blended mix in ( yes , seriously , it 's fine ) . 
  then i slowly cooked it for about 20 minutes . 
  i added crushed tomatoes in it ( it 's the uh , pulped tomatoes , not a tomato soup which is different ) until it turns orange . 
  you then also add a good amount of half and half cooking cream milk . 
  cook for another 10 minutes and taste . 
  add salt/kayene pepper as appropriate . 
  steer occasionally . 
  needs about 1h total cooking in low fire . 
  last 10 minutes . 
  you should add white wine . 
  when it 's done , add the rest of the lobster meat inside , and enjoy !, 
  come out looking like [ this ] ( http://cooksandeats.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/lobster1.jpg ) . 
  it 's a creamy , very lobster tasting soup and it is delicious .

  and france 's . 
  you did n't actively ask for greece 's head , like germany did , but you washed your hands . 
  this is what enrages me the most when i think about what happened last summer . 
  germany 's alliance is free to do anything it wants while giants like france or the uk prefer to stay neutral . 
  the union was n't supposed to be germany 's turf . 
  and i 'm not saying the uk should free greece from all its sins . 
  but at least do something god damn it . 
  you used to have 1/3 of the world a century ago and now all you do is sign whatever germany proposes without even reading . 
  the uk nowadays feels like an empire on pension . 
  they do n't give a fuck about anything that does n't directly affect them . 
  that 's already happening . 
  syriza is only leftist in the name nowadays , like pasok . 
  the agenda they push is fully neo-liberal . 
  so your solution is to let the refugees flood my country until the state crumbles and then they may decide to stop coming . 
  why do n't we evacuate an island from the locals and flood it with refugees while we 're at it ? 
  it would make a great tv show . 
  this man is n't protecting anybody . 
  he just enjoys violence and his outlet is this far right-wing group . 
  do n't make heroes of zeros . 
  his karma says otherwise . 
  do n't know if he 's a troll or not , but i know that people seem to agree with him . 
  so either the trolls are too many and they agree with each other , or the popular opinion shifted too much , to the point where it agrees with a guy named emperor trump . 
  they somehow became protectors of the people now ? 
  this man cares about protecting the swedish people , as much as a hooligan actually cares about his team . 
  hint : he does n't . 
  people like him only care about beating up other people . 
  his way of justifying it is his affiliation with this far-right group . 
  others find football teams a more attractive gateway to channel this need for blood . 
  and that 's supposed to make it easier to swallow ? 
  this man has no job beating migrants . 
  this is n't the marvel universe . 
  we do n't need no vigilantes , taking justice into their own hands . 
  these are the same bullshit excuses golden dawn uses here in greece to attack refugees and immigrants . 
  `` we 're just targeting the bad ones '' . 
  i understand that you guys do n't like this crisis , but you should n't try to justify the actions of neo-nazis . 
  europe is better than this . 
  if eu was actually a union , something similar to what was initially proposed would be fair . 
  split those refugees among countries . 
  a real union would n't let one , or some of its member to suffer because the rest do n't want to go in such a hassle . 
  but because it is n't a real union , it will just readjust schengen and kick the problematic countries out of it . 
  or admit that this time , your politicians fucked up . 
  big time . 
  and if you ask me , i predict that europe will just kick the mediterranean countries out of schengen . 
  especially greece . 
  they wo n't admit that nothing can actually be done by greece because it 's not legal or humane to shoot boats full of unarmed people but they also do n't want the refugees in their borders . 
  it 's the best solution for the north and that 's all the justification the eu needs to act . 
  not feeding anyone . 
  i 'm not planning on arguing with this guy . 
  i just felt that someone had to say it and move on . 
  and i did . 
  yeah , you forget that northern countries forget that southern europe exists when they do n't need it . 
  the whole situation is ridiculous . 
  you have danes , germans and finnish all crying about the refugees destroying their country and they do n't even have a small fraction of the refugees that we have here . 
  first they forced us to keep our borders open , promising that they 'll take at least some of them . 
  then they changed their mind and now they have to find someone to blame for all this . 
  and who 's a better victim than the lazy greeks ? 
  yeah , let 's blame the greeks for not guarding their borders properly . 
  let 's force them to shoot down boats full of people so the poor little dane up north can sleep safely . 
  you are lucky you did n't join this eu . 
  it took a few years but cowards show their faces under pressure and the refugee crisis was the best at doing exactly this . 
  could you kindly go fuck yourself , sir ? 
  which is pretty accurate . 
  ionians were the ancestors of our ancestors . 
  well , frankly , there 's nothing you can do about it . 
  we call ourselves hellas for centuries , yet the rest of the world is like `` sure , greece ! '' . 
  same thing we do with france . 
  everybody else calls the country france , the land of the franks , but we call it '' \u0393\u03b1\u03bb\u03bb\u03b9\u03b1 '' , the land of the gauls . 
  and these people are n't even the descendants of gauls . 
  they 're franks . 
  once a country finds a name about you , you 're done . 
  countries are assholes sometimes . 
  your language is awesome but do n't you think we have to make some sacrifices to find a common ground in this union ? 
  if we ca n't agree in a common language , how are we supposed to agree in more serious matters ? 
  coming from a country with a unique language that only us and cypriots speak , i would n't ask anyone else to learn greek just to visit us . 
  it 's kind of selfish . 
  english is the universal language and we have to make some sacrifices and learn it . 
  the greek communist party would vote no even if they voted to save their lives . 
  they are notorious for that . 
  they stopped caring about the country many decades ago , when they realised that it wo n't be good for them to win the elections . 
  some of their theories sound good but they can never be applied to a country in the 21st century . 
  so they restricted themselves to just oppose whatever the current government says , even if they agree to it just to get elected into the parliament . 
  i do n't think / u/cametosaybla is talking about the geographical barrier between the eu and israel . 
  he is talking about the cultural difference . 
  yes , israel has always played a part in the western politics . 
  but they were never considered `` west '' . 
  israel belongs in the middle east . 
  their traditions are middle eastern , their culture is middle eastern and some things they consider normal are highly frowned upon in the west . 
  they 're a heavily militarized society that is frequently involved in military conflicts . 
  they also are n't very kind on some minorities that the west nowadays treats as equals , like homosexuals and muslims . 
  they also need to clear up their diplomatic and military conflicts with some of their neighbors , because it does n't make them look good . 
  finland is not eastern europe in the same sense that greece is not considered eastern europe . 
  they never experienced communism . 
  i sincerely hope history judges the current european leaders the way they deserve . 
  highly unlikely since the winners write history , but europe will regret electing those coward lawyers to lead europe to unification pretty soon . 
  they 'll drive europe to a war or a severe episode at this rate . 
  when a problem they need to resolve appears they quickly hide it under the rag and pretend it does n't exist . 
  they treat countries like shitholes . 
  this incident basically turns greece into a human dumpster plain and simple . 
  the same leaders who said that europe needs to treat this like union crisis instead of a greek or italian , the same people wash their hands at the first obstacle . 
  the word `` leader '' is insulted when it is put next to the cowards who we put in the helm of europe .

  yes . 
  is it possible for greece to do so ? 
  is it possible for greece even to support 1.5 mil illegal immigrants ? 
  the difference is that i am a realist and you are not . 
  if i can i will help , if i can not , i wo n't it is simple as that . 
  it has nothing to do with racism or cruelty or anything , it is simple facts . 
  you can not help poor people when you are poor yourself . 
  so , the solution is to make them all legal , so they will leave greece and go to other eu countries ? 
  and you think that this will be ok with other countries ? 
  if we do that , the rest of the eu will close the borders with us before the first 100 crosses them !, 
  do not be fooled by other people 's charitable comments in here . 
  all people are very nice as long as the problem does not affect them !, 
  if they find out that we are giving papers and they are going to have an influx of 1,5 mil immigrants they will change their point of view in immediately . 
  plus , even if these 1,5 leave ... word will spread that we are legalizing everyone and another 1,5 mil will come in a few months time . 
  then what ? 
  give papers again ? 
  i would love to help the whole world but if you have n't noticed greece is in a pretty bad state . 
  at this point we can not cater adequately for greek people in need . 
  it is impossible to cater for illegal immigrants . 
  as simple as that . 
  if it was within our powers to help them , then yes . 
  but it is not , at least for the time being !, 
  at last , the government starts to take action . 
  when you have 1,5 mil illegal immigrants in a 10 mil , almost bankrupt , country you can easily understand the problems . 
  yes ... your charities . 
  you forgot to mention how many ( if any ) illegal immigrants you have in the uk . 
  and what will your charities do if 15 % of the population was illegaly staying there . 
  at the same time you got many british people suffering due to an economic crisis . 
  it is easy to critisize when you are far away and unaffected by the situation . 
  but if it was britain with the problem ... you were having exceptionally bad situation due to an economic crisis ... and 1 out of 6 people were there illegally ( do not overlook that - there is no problem with legal immigrants ) . 
  you would support them , or you would try to support your people first ? 
  because yes , i have absolutely no problem with helping foreginers if i can afford it . 
  but what if i do n't ? 
   absolutely nothing stops them feeding the tiny proportion of non-citizens that might happen to be in need of help you really do know the greek reality . 
  the ` tiny ' proportion that you are referring to is no less than 1,5 million illegal immigrants . 
  if that does not strike you like a big number let me remind you that greece is a 10mil people country . 
  so tell me , how many illegal immigrants your country hosts ? 
  and what do you do to help them ? 
  sorry , i do not understand . 
  excuses for what ? 
  since i live in greece let me tell you some things that you may not hear in the media . 
  ( that we turned xenophobic , racist , and hate foreigner in general out of the blue ) greece is the only country in europe that has a problem with uncontrolled illegal immigration . 
  we are a 11 million people country and currently we host about 1,5 million illegal immigrants . 
  why i say ` about ' ? 
  because nobody know the exact number , they are illegal , there is no way to exactly count them !, 
  on top of that we have a number of legal immigrants that work and live here , and nobody has a problem with them . 
  can you imagine the burden on all aspects of the society that this creates ? 
  a society already hit by crisis ? 
  so yes , what the media ` forget ' to inform is that we are talking about illegal immigrants . 
  people in europe thinks that we go about assaulting people that are not greek . 
  nobody hated foreigners before and nobody hates them now . 
  but uncontrollable influx of illegal immigrants have created problems that you ca n't even imagine . 
  do you honestly think that people wanting to stop illegal immigration are racist ? 
  and how many illegal immigrants the other eu countries currently host ? 
  various banks about a year ago predicted that greece had a 97 % chance to go bankrupt and leave the euro . 
  now they say 90 % . 
  shall i consider this as an improvement in greek economy ? 
  all the evidence is at least 25 years old . 
  they said a number of times publicly that they will work to further their political agenda through democratic legitimate ways . 
  and of course the supreme court of greece decided that they are legal and have the right to participate in the elections . 
  but then again , who cares about the supreme court and voters in a democracy . 
  the right thing , is our opinion . 
  so yeah , if you say so , they are outlaws . 
  edit : also do not forget that in 1987 they were an organization . 
  it is not until 1993 that they registered as a political party . 
  so , the link you provided predates the creation of the party !, 
  am i seriously getting 4 links for 3 cases that have not concluded yet in court and in most of them left wing parties are involved ? 
  do any of those refer to violence against immigrants ? 
  what makes a vocal supporter ? 
  from all the ` evidence ' i saw in various sites there is nothing more than 3-4 tweets which are from various greek news sites . 
  nothing illiegal , nothing sketchy . 
  for example i think there is one tweet with a link to a news article talking about a speech one of the golden dawn made in the greek parliament . 
  so , is it illegal to link to articles talking about a political party 's actions ? 
  after all let 's not forget that when all this happened she had virtually no followers . 
  she had about 40 friends in her account . 
  it is just after the event that this number turned to several thousand . 
  also it is impossible to turn this thread into a golden dawn discussion thread . 
  but i have to say this objectively as i can . 
  they say the worst things about this party , nazis , facists , murderers etc. 
  but when i ask , who did they murder ? 
  there is no reply . 
  just an old photo of hitler on their magazine dated 1987 . 
  all the time they say everything but prove nonthing . 
  but then again the word neo-nazi ignites enough emotional reflexes for people to hate them no questions and evidence asked . 
  just to remind everyone that golden down is a legitimate political party in the greek parliament . 
  they are not outlaws and certainly not the way the media are trying to describe them to be . 
  taking some sentences out of context does not make your opinions valid . 
  the trend shows that they gain popularity with each passing day . 
  it is impossible that a big portion of greek population is turning neo-nazi . 
  also it is impossible that one of the most hospitable nations on this planet has turned racist , hostile and xenophobic in a matter of months . 
  so , the truth must lay somewhere else . 
  before you believe everything that the media serves , make some research . 
  anyhow , i believe that if you check the accounts of all the greek athletes on the national team , many of them may be following political parties . 
  should we ban them too ? 
  what if i say that i am offended by left-party athletes because of their stance against religion ? 
  ( i do n't care it 's an example ), 
  fine , if your unexplicable hate towards the athelete does not derive from political reasons , i accept that i am wrong to judge you like that . 
  please explain in simplistic terms , so that my simple mind can proccess it , where is the racist part of the tweet and why all this hate . 
  you , said ` good riddance ' after all . 
  i bet that you , like me , did not even know the name of the athelete before this event took place .

  did fox news , bild , the sun , daily mail cease to exist ? 
  because these are as anti-pc as it gets . 
  i did n't see any political correctness in the media during the 5 year long coverage of the greek crisis . 
  noone got tried or jailed for it by the mythical cultural marxist pc censors . 
  what are you people arguing against ? 
  i find it amusing how all this anti-pc rhetoric eventually boils down to their ability to spew hate and abuse people like they used to . 
  [ in the words of the great stewart lee ] ( https://youtu.be/bmsv1tuesrc?t=91 ), 
  that 's just not true . 
  not for all european countries anyway . 
  edit : greece and cyprus have had a close relationship with the levantine countries historically . 
  there are greek orthodox christians in syria , for example . 
  it 's not funny , unfortunately . 
  after the paris attacks there were a lot of edgy redditors going around and cynically declaring that yes , french lives matter more than lebanese or indian lives because france belongs to the west while the others `` are shitholes anyway '' . 
  you can see the same in the immigration threads , some even cheer on the drownings of syrian children because `` that will deter the rest of them from coming to europe '' . 
  the left has given up because this sub has become reuropean lite . 
  also , a lot of greeks , russians , french and others have left because at periods people would downvote them just for their flair . 
  * looks at username * ooooh , nevermind . 
  you are not a wehraboo , the poles sure know how many war crimes were carried out by the wehrmacht . 
  i just think there are many misconceptions about ww2 that people believe due to the way the war is taught and depicted . 
  germany being militarily superior to the allies and ussr winning the war just because they threw numbers is one of the biggest . 
   at least hitler knew of strategy , stalin did n't , so he ordered many soldiers to die . 
  hitler , the guy who decided to invade the soviet union and declare war on the us , knew of strategy ? 
  you probably do n't understand what strategy means . 
   at least nato did it 's job . 
  dropping bombs is easy , actually managing the fucking country is the hard part . 
  so many successful states these bombings have created ... 
  yeah , i meant the island ( albion ? ), 
  without scotland , basically . 
  england looks like a reverse greece in this map , lol . 
  where is your empire now ?? 
  it has a couple lines about wild animals living in crete , but some say it 's an allegory for the cretan rebels who hid in the mountains and fought the turks . 
  [ one of my favourite cretan folk songs ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og6wzovfgao ) [ a famous rebetiko song ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjeb6zaskx0 ) edit : lol @ the person downvoting all the greek songs . 
  so which part of all that was not reported by the media ? 
  are you seriously suggesting islamist terrorism is under-reported by the western media ? 
  as it should . 
  fighting is quite the exercise . 
  yeah , i know he meant yellow skin . 
  it was cringey as fuck . 
  greece and cyprus can into western european looks like . 
  santorini among the cheapest ? 
  whaaaaat ? 
  lol !, 
  greek nationalists and religious nuts have a similar prophecy that says `` greece will be liberated by the blonde nation '' , implying russia . 
  so you are saying that afghanistan is dangerous for them to return ? 
  another glorious capitulation by tsipras and co. . one starts to wonder whether they have ever really negotiated anything and this is just a show from all sides . 
   east germany , because it still exists , although relocated in a warmer place and now quite inoffensive . 
  wow , til . 
   the republic of molossia , a micronation in the united states , is at war with east germany because of this island . 
  also reagan saying they need to protect the devout muslims from the communist atheists in afghanistan . . 
  funny how the left is constantly accused of being emotional , moralistic and not rooted in reality when the discussion yesterday showed exactly the opposite . 
  this is n't exactly true . 
  isis and al qaeda are madmen but there is some method to their madness . 
  i might sound cynical for saying this , but the fact that countries like germany and greece have n't been targeted ( yet ) is n't a coincidence . 
  tony benn was an honest social democrat . 
  his son starting his labour leadership campaign with a speech supporting the conservatives in a bombing vote is n't a good omen at all . 
  a lot of users here are seriously advocating that the refugee camps should be as horrid and inhumane as possible so that they act as a deterrent for more refugees coming to europe . 
  these people want greece to create and maintain mini-guantanamos in the aegean , lol . 
  `` if only greece bombed syria and armed shady islamist types like we do , then refuse to help refugees who try to flee the hell we helped create '', 
  when did we complain about mandatory quotas ? 
  i thought greece was among the few countries that were with germany on this . 
  i am keeping an eye on the guardian live feed and cameron just repeated the claim that there are 70,000 moderate anti-assad fighters in syria , and he 's not including the kurds in this figure . 
  i am no expert on syria and i 'd love to see an analysis of this claim in / r/syriancivilwar , but to me this looks like he is whitewashing al nusra and all the saudi/turkey backed islamist jihadists . 
  sweden used to be reddit 's and 4chan 's utopia , because they imagined it as this awesome aryan nation with beautiful women , free stuff for white people , atheism , etc. 
  when they realised that most swedes are actually decent , progressive people who treat immigrants humanely and they are n't just internet ` brogressives ' who care only about themselves , they became so butthurt that the sweden circlejerk made a complete 180 and all the dank memes about swedistan began . 
  it 's been well documented in the various meta subs , just do a search for ` sweden ' . 
  have the liberal democrats decided to support david cameron 's plan for airstrikes in syria ? 
  if yes , why ? 
  / r/europe : where the same people who vehemently deny the existence of al-qaeda in syria will bitch about refugees and `` islamisation of europe '' . 
  here in greece , humanities and law students are still required to learn ancient greek and latin in order to get to a university . 
   gdp does not account for quality of life well , sweden consistently ranks among the top 5 in quality of life indices too , but considering you 're an american i am not surprised you do n't know how to read countries ' names . 
  that 's the problem though , in all seriousness . 
  our # 1 potential military danger by far is turkey ( sorry fyrom , albania , bulgaria ) . 
  turkey does have other potential ` fronts ' like syria , russia , kurds but it would only help the turkish economy if they could slow down their spending in regards to greece . 
  spending so much only helps nationalist politicians in both countries and the people selling weapons to both of us - which happen to also be members of nato . 
  then clearly nato is doing a shit job as `` an alliance for peace '' . 
   with the greeks and italians its policing the mediterranean i sure as hell hope we are n't expected to police an area that includes libya , egypt , israel , palestine , syria , lebanon , cyprus and turkey . 
  what could possibly go wrong ? 
  are the pkk kurds the same people as the backwards islamist kurds ? 
  a lot of kurds in turkey vote for erdogan and some have even joined isis in syria and iraq . 
  but i bet they are n't the same who support hdp , pkk or the ypg in syria . 
   practice run practice run ... for what ? 
   i prevent putting myself in a situation where i would be stuck in a mass shelter with other young men and nothing to do . 
  i am sure you put a lot of effort into being born in the right country . 
  dumping people in horrible ghettos like the jungle in calais is not left wing politics . 
  with all that bullshit narrative going around reddit next thing we 'll hear the ghettos in us cities were the work of communist spies . . 
  is n't sweden supposed to become a third-world country any minute now ? 
  reddit lied to me !, 
  walter duranty is literally obama ? 
  what 's more naive is to believe capitalism is the final form of human social evolution . 
  human societies with a certain degree of organisation exist for thousands of years , capitalism as a global system is only ~ 300 years old . 
   state capitalism is just a term marxist made up whenever communist attempts failed . 
  it wasnt communism it was capitalism . 
  afaik only a certain trotskyist group supports the analysis that su was a state capitalism society . 
  it 's not a matter of ideological purity . 
  the very definition of communism is the absence of classes and more importantly * the state * . 
  both of these did n't remotely hold true for the eastern bloc societies . 
   for some reason having agenda of eliminating a class of people is not such a big of an issue . 
  you probably are aware of this , but just for conversation 's sake : when marx , engels and lenin in their theoretical works talk about eliminating a class they do n't mean * physically * eliminating the members of this class . 
  they mean stripping them of economic and political power . 
   there are lots of progressives who still believe stalin was communist , while actually quite the opposite he ruined the project and the notion of communism .

  jesus stil never stated that homosexuality is bad but that 's enough to claim that christianity does n't support gay peopl - at least for me - . 
  that 's right , edited . 
  islam is n't accepting gay people . 
  it ca n't be more obvious , deal with it . 
  your religion ( assuming you are muslim ) is not pro-gay . 
   being gay is acceptable , but you have to supress it brain-error-404-how-the-fck-you-do-that-omfg . 
  christianity is based in the new testament . 
  jesus never excluded gay people , or said anything about holy wars ( ~ ~ jihaaad ~ ~ ) . 
  christianity and islam are not similar at all .

  i already said that it changed so you stil do n't have an argument when you say `` according to my definition '' and you did say different when you pointed out '' idea of nation is more recent than you might think . '', 
  you contradict . 
  i never said the criteria applies in all eras , in fact one who reads my text should understand that while time passes the criteria changes . 
  wtf til . 
  xddddddddd, 
  well i have '' : ppp '' meaning that this text is something not to be taken seriously . 
  i was rude indeed but i did it in a humoristic way which can not be seen unless i put an / s. 
  anyway since i did n't and actions matter most sorry , i did not want to offend you . 
  no need to judge someone from one reply . . have a nice day :-) and of course i will check this sub !, 
  no i do n't . 
  you did n't give an example where someone would call himself a greek for different reasons and please do n't point out any exception like someone who would do that to save his life ... 
  the idea of the greek nation is not recent . 
  the olympics started as a way to unify greeks , something that alexander the great eventually did . 
  later due to the roman times a confusion indeed existed however at the late times of the roman empire the greek notion came back ( ! ) . 
  as the empire shrunk people used to compare the turks to persians.one might say that those two had no connection , but greeks at that time thought that as they won the persians they 'd kick out the turks too.plus the very last emporor constantine palaiologos was not only called a `` roman emperor '' but `` king of greeks '' too !, 
  so greek national identity whether it was greeks or romioi or greeks again existed . 
   the turks , on the other hand , have taken something like 70 % of ethnic greek land before the 10th century . 
  when you write this someone who knows english understands that the turks took greek lands before the 10th century . 
  what you most likely wanted to write is this ( and with some help of that turkish friend that replied too is ) : the turks , on the other hand , have taken something like 70 % of land that was ethnic greek at that time . 
  we speak the same language although you need to start using it more often lel . 
  how is kapodistrias a good example ? 
  if anyone is orthodox and speaks greek as first langue ( in that era ) it means he is greek , nothing complex for my perspective at least . 
  orthodox churches of other nations existed so even if someone is orthodox and balkan it did n't mean he was greek ... 
  you must work at translation of google translate ;-p, 
  dude wtf you said  the turks , on the other hand , have taken something like 70 % of ethnic greek land before the 10th century . 
  that means that turks took greek lands before 10th century lol . 
  you clearly stated that and you studied history of bulgaria ... jesus , edit it idk i ca n't see that crap easily . 
  the way i learned history was simple-the tradition of the hellinification of the balkans started with king philip of macedonia , continued and spread due to the byzantine empire and stopped mostly with the slavic invasions . 
  however , after reading about the jire\u010dek line i agree that indeed not a big part of the balkans that was ethnic greek was taken . 
  i assumed you are bulgarian due to the flag but even if you are a pole both nations have slavic `` roots '' so yeah your ancestors are slavs .

  no big deal .

  this 1.5 % is growth compared to last year , after the imposed capital controls that caused a big slump in growth .

  he has gathered a bunch of rich elitist artists and expects to create a movement . 
  his disease is progressing steadily as i see . 
  i m not sure . 
  greek economy is very dependent on eu funds in various forms . 
  and greek people are relatively well educated ( but without work experience ) . 
  they wo n't settle for super-low-wages , they leave the country instead . 
  our agriculture is still dependent on eu subsidies . 
  our research institutions have to rely more and more on eu funding or face closing . 
  and we face huge demographic downsides in the following decades . 
  i know the bailouts are used to serve old debt . 
  you realize that somebody would have to pay that debt though . 
  and greek economy was and still is extremely dependent on euro liquidity and eu subsidies . 
  it 's not so easy to go full argentina on eu / eurozone . 
  nigel is an even bigger attention whore than donald i think . 
  and he s an extremely needy person . 
  you know how this will end , donald will feed him to his piranhas pretty soon . 
  who ? 
  speak , kitten !, 
  mission accomplished i guess , its time to come out of his cage . 
  its more complicated than that . 
  i mean , without help from the eu it would be much worse for greece . 
  by simon nixon nov. 13 , 2016 2:03 p.m. 
  et europe 's antiestablishment politicians have barely been able to contain their excitement at donald trump 's election victory . 
  from france 's marine le pen to hungary 's viktor orban to the u.k. 's nigel farage , they have greeted the u.s. president-elect 's triumph as a validation of their own longstanding opposition to immigration and free trade . 
  with a series of political tests looming in europe over the next year -- starting with next month 's austrian presidential election and italian constitutional referendum and followed by elections in the netherlands , france and germany in 2017 -- european populist parties now sense an opportunity to ride to electoral success on mr. trump 's coat tails . 
  but there is a crucial difference between the u.s. and european situations . 
  the market senses that mr. trump 's win is likely to pave the way for a change in u.s. economic strategy . 
  last week stocks rose and bonds fell as investors bet that his pledges of lower corporate taxes , fewer regulations and more large-scale infrastructure spending would boost company profits and inflation , easing some of the pressure on the fed , which may be able to raise rates sooner and faster than previously expected . 
  in contrast , it is currently hard to see electoral success for populist parties in the eurozone leading to significant change in national economic policies . 
  instead , it is likely to heap further pressure on the european central bank -- perhaps more than it can bear . 
  that is partly because eurozone fiscal rules leave little scope for significant changes in fiscal policy . 
  most eurozone governments are still obliged to continue to bring down deficits and debt levels . 
  those countries that have the fiscal capacity to provide more stimulus are those that need it least : in germany , unemployment is below 6 % and there are signs that rising wages are starting to feed into domestic inflation . 
  meanwhile , those countries with the greatest slack and therefore most at risk of deflation , such as italy and portugal , are those with the least fiscal space . 
  efforts to boost investment via common eu programs such as the so-called juncker plan have so far had little appreciable impact on growth . 
  success for populist parties is also likely to make it even harder for governments to deliver either growth-enhancing domestic overhauls or build a consensus around the overhauls to the governance of the euro area that most economists say are vital to secure its long-term financial stability . 
  indeed , the prospects for deeper eurozone integration appear to be receding as governments have responded to growing euroskeptic pressure by putting new obstacles in the way . 
  for example , the netherlands now has a law requiring the government to hold a referendum on any eu-related legislation if 300,000 voters demand it . 
  this device has already been used to block an eu trade deal with ukraine . 
  similarly , the belgian region of wallonia last month nearly torpedoed the eu 's free-trade deal with canada . 
  so far , ecb action has enabled eurozone governments to duck difficult decisions . 
  but even before mr. trump 's election , it was facing unpalatable choices over how to keep its quantitative-easing program going in the face of a looming scarcity of eligible bonds under its strict self-imposed rules . 
  despite a recent rise in bond yields that has eased immediate scarcity concerns , policy makers know they need to convince markets at a time of global uncertainty that they have the tools to respond to future shocks . 
  they also know that all the possible options involve breaking political , legal and technical taboos , raising the prospect of a political backlash in germany . 
  at the same time , the eurozone faces a series of imminent challenges that could test its cohesion . 
  there is no sign of any resolution to the three-way standoff among berlin , athens and the international monetary fund over debt relief for greece , without which officials fear a new greek crisis is inevitable next year . 
  similarly , rome and brussels are at loggerheads over next year 's italian budget as well as the application of eu rules that may require bondholders in some italian banks to take losses as part of recapitalization exercises . 
  policy makers fear that governments may simply decide to act unilaterally in breach of eu rules rather than pay a domestic price , thereby calling into question the legal premise upon which the ecb has based its actions . 
  even if the eurozone dodges these shocks , policy makers fear trouble ahead if the recovery continues and inflation picks up . 
  the prospect of higher inflation may ease pressure on the fed . 
  but it threatens to make the ecb 's life harder as it will have to choose between stopping quantitative easing -- running the risk that borrowing costs for the most indebted governments could rise sharply -- or tolerating above-target inflation , which could undermine competitiveness and living standards in germany . 
  that could blow political tensions into the open . 
  the reality is that there are some decisions that the eurozone ca n't duck for much longer -- and which may yet have to be confronted just when politicians are least able to respond . 
  i dont want to start conspiracy theories ( i do ) , but i do n't get the trump-farage bromance and i wonder who can be behind both of them . 
  i 've noticed that the pro-trump media have turned pro-lepen now . 
  melania 's family has established close connections i hear  also , follow his money . 
  where in europe has he invested ? 
  he 's takes the prize for the weirdest fetish ever . 
   and trump probably would n't have won the americans ( rightfully ) didnt give much shit for brexit . 
  ok guys , do n't all jump at once !, 
  sorry , where is that number ? 
  come on guys , who wants to pay first ? 
  more technically a republic . 
  but their democracy is admired since the time of alexis de tocqueville . 
  but since we are playing with words , democracy itself is not even about elections : in ancient athens almost all officials were chosen by lot , not elections . 
  tremendous hilter . 
  it 's the best hitler , believe me . 
  yes i agree but it 's fun to ponder what happens in a parallel universe, 
  best by some metrics , sorely lacking in some others , let 's just agree there is no single metric . 
  the question is can america maintain its happy face if it is no longer the only superpower ? 
  i 'm asking that because in america 's competitive culture , winning is revered more than in other countries . 
  interesting that about social cohesion . 
  watching your news feels like you re cosntantly at each other 's throats ,

  there is a circlejerk in reddit on every major issue . 
  reddit takes a subject to the extreme . 
  but that is not to say there is n't some underlying issue ( s ) that needs to be resolved . 
   and germany only paid 3 billion euro . 
  the cost of refrugees to turkey is much much higher than that number . 
  turkey is clearly struggling on this matter and noone really cares other than germany . 
  an estimate i have heard is $ 7b until the end of 2015 and that is a lot of money . 
  surely turkey must be assisted by the eu and the international community . 
  but at the same time i would also like to know how much was spent by turkey trying to destabilize syria to serve its own geopolitical agenda . 
  it is not as if turkey is a complete bystander regarding the syrian war . 
   look how much greece suffering from this and how much eu is helping them on this matter ... any assistance given to greece in the matter of the refugees is too little and came too late . 
  and the potential closing off of shenghen borders to greece does n't seem particularly helpful either . 
   europe should not have to accept millions of refugees/illegal immigrants ** because greece is unable/unwilling to cooperate with turkey for controlling their joint border ** . 
  full of shit right there . 
  turkey lets the refugees walk the ** entire length ** of their country unhindered , board boats ** every day from the same beaches ** to cross the aegean , and refuses to accept back to their shores ** the same people who illegally left from there ** ; and it still somehow is the fault of greece for `` not cooperating '' with turkey . 
  gtfo . 
    there 's no sense of urgency in dealing with this crisis  well , there is . 
  if nothing is done soon , tourism this year will be in a very bad state which will bring down the economy even more . 
   not really . 
  there are not 225,000 crimeans missing due to ukrainian political actions . 
  are we still speaking in comparison to kosovo ? 
  are you talking about things that happened during soviet times ? 
  if you are comparing with kosovo , where does the number 225,000 come from ? 
  the [ highest number possible ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kosovo_war#casualties ) for casualties in kosovo between 1995 and 2000 is 12,000 including serbians and roma killed by [ kla . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kosovo_liberation_army#massacres )  there was no attempted genocide by ukraine and there certainly was no ethnic cleansing in crimea . 
  if you can show me evidence contrary to what i said i 'd be happy to indulge . 
  after yanukovych was toppled , the people of crimea could have felt they were no longer represented in the government of their country . 
  a population , that is concerned in one area which they have historically populated for generations , may then decide to govern themselves . 
  in the same way it happened in kosovo . 
  whether the people of crimea , in the same way the people of kosovo , have ** the right ** to do that is another matter . 
  but it is the same case for both regions . 
  ethnic cleansing by whatever means is abhorrent anywhere it occurs , including the northern part of kosovo in the present day . 
   well kosovo was a province of serbia and croatia and bosnia were provinces of yugolsvia i do n't think kosovo had the legal right to even split `` the [ icj ] ( http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/141/15988.pdf ) concluded unanimously in 2010 that kosovo 's declaration of independence of 17 february 2008 did not violate general international law . '', 
  my opinion on the matter may differ but nobody asked me , or you . 
   so i do n't even know why are we having this conversation . 
  might is right and that 's it . 
  i 'm actually fine with that . 
  what pisses me off is being forced into doublethink by either side .

  hope you overcome your addiction !, 
  being a bit older , the last game that had me hooked was starcraft . 
  the first one ... 
   but kosovo did n't want independance . 
  kosovo albanians wanted it . 
  to be honest , 70 % of people living in kosovo are indeed albanians , 90 % if the northern part of kosovo is to be excluded . 
  and i suspect that was the reason why a referendum was not called in the first place ...  so your solution is to give every minority in every country a right to make a country if it holds a referendum only in part of a country inhabited with that particular minority and without consent of whole country and central government ? 
  it is not ** my ** solution , i am simply pointing out that if something like that would be acceptable in the case of kosovo , then it should be equally acceptable in the case of crimea . 
   so 100 000 serbs want to declare independance in the middle of austria . 
  sure , just hold a referndum where only serbs in austria can vote . 
  this is the exact reason why people have to decide whether if both the cases of kosovo and crimea are ** equally ** acceptable or not . 
  if they are both acceptable then your example is also valid . 
  if they are both unacceptable then your example is also invalid . 
   are you from parallel reality ? 
  how are things there ? 
  is xcom 2 less buggy there ? 
  what is xcom 2 and how does it affect your life ? 
  a referendum in kosovo in 1991 , as well as in every other region of yugoslavia , would have been the best solution . 
  but each side made their own kind of referenda , that the other side did not accept , and what followed was horror for the entire country . 
   i dnno who taught you history but referrendums about yugoslavia were held in major provinces   it could be argued that kosovo should have been allowed to do a similar referendum ** immediately after yugoslavia was dissolved ** as well . 
  the results would have been very similar . 
  there was no referendum in kosovo in 1991 or after . 
  what was the reason for this ? 
    in fact , if regional referanda were held ** in every major city ** within yugoslavia ( of whether the people wanted to remain in the union or not ) , ** and the results accepted by everyone ** , the war could have been avoided . 
  the referanda were ** not ** accepted from the other respected sides ; and were not implemented in every region of former yugoslavia . 
  well , i stand corrected !, 
  there should have been a referendum and the areas that wanted to form an independent state should then have been treated in the same manner as crimea . 
  it could be argued that kosovo should have been allowed to do a similar referendum immediately after yugoslavia was dissolved as well . 
  the results would have been very similar . 
  in fact , if regional referanda were held in every major city within yugoslavia ( of whether the people wanted to remain in the union or not ) , and the results accepted by everyone , the war could have been avoided . 
  ~ ~ there was a referendum ~ ~ there was a declaration of independence in kosovo and there was a referendum in crimea . 
  either both are legitimate or neither is . 
  could i get a source for that in english please ? 
  kosovo has as much a right to leave serbia as crimea has a right to leave ukraine . 
  edit : phrased differently : kosovo did not have the right to leave serbia and neither did crimea have the right to leave ukraine . 
  in order for one to be true ( or false ) , the other must equally be true ( or false ) . 
  the differences between these two regions are minimal as regards to their history during the last 30 years . 
  the diagram represents the flawed data it was based upon . 
  it is not the fault of the person who made the diagram ( although s/he could have done a bit more independent research ) but of those who compiled the information erroneously . 
  greek * lexical * distance lol, 
   from the same article :  a detailed report seen by germany 's bild newspaper listed a total of 1,688 sex crimes committed by ** asylum seekers ** , refugees ** and illegal immigrants ** in 2015 -- 3.6 per cent of the nationwide total of almost 47,000 . 
   of those , 458 were rapes or sexual assaults . 
  * ** refugees ** make up roughly 2 per cent of germany 's population , the the local reported , meaning the rate of sexual offences is disproportionately high . 
  * question no1 : are n't part of the asylum seekers making a false claim to asylum , coming from countries that are not at war or from governments that are not persecuting them ? 
  should n't they then be differentiated somehow ? 
  and different statistics be made depending on each specific group ? 
  question no2 : what are the statistics specifically to genuine refugees ( those who have obtained asylum status ) ? 
  question no3 : why are illegal immigrants ( those who were already determined to not qualify for asylum ) allowed to remain in europe ? 
  why is there no paneuropean policy in place to deport these people directly to their countries of origin ? 
  who is really to blame for the crimes committed by these people ? 
  question no4 : how was the designation `` refugees '' used in the last paragraph ? 
  is 2 % of the population only refugees or all the categories above together ? 
  stay safe man . 
  and i hope you are using a proxy ... 
  they would actually look best on what remains of the berlin wall . 
  not all of them . 
  many thousands have even got bulgarian passports as well ( in secret of course ) ... 
  yes , but most were rescued . 
  those of them that could n't swim though ... 
  not sure if that many but surely over 2.000 already .

  the management is appointed by the government and this is exaclty the reason why ert is in this sorry state . 
  the same politicians that used ert to promote their agendas/attack the opposition/hire their voters now come and say : `` this is a mess . 
  we will shut it down and create everything from scratch to stop the corrutpion . '' . 
  and they want us to believe that they wo n't corrupt again the new station, 
  imo there are plenty measures that can help growth in the periphery . 
  first of all a banking union is needed asap . 
  the banks in greece are actually zombies that strugle to work an as a result plenty of healthy businesses are forced to shut down because they do n't have access to loans even though they export their products . 
  another measure would be to seriously tackle corruption in the public sector that is a huge stopper for businesses . 
  and of course europe could give a hand to greece in order to profit from the possible petroleum deposits . 
  instead of these , what the troika only wants here is to lay off public servants in order to reduce the deficit and on the same time sell profitable public enterprises like water supply companies . 
  not to mention the fact that german newspapers demanded the greek people to vote again the two parties that created this shitty situation with the disfuctional and corrupted public sector . 
  our fault is that we allow these kind of conflicts to go on indefinitely by supporting either of the two sides . 
  eg , now that the syrian government seems to have the upper hand in the conflict eu decided to raise the embargo for weapon to the rebels . 
  and as a result more and more syrans will be killed or flee their homes and more and more arms sellers will profit . 
  but , umm wait , this will increase eauropean exports so we should see it in a positive way , right ? 
  and how do you propose to do it ? 
  btw , now that the embargo on the syran rebels is lifted , if greece is flooded with syrian refugees , what should we do ? 
  lets face the truth , the refugees wo n't decrease unless we stop messing in other countries, 
  do you volunteer to host the refugees of this mess in the netherlands ? 
  cause i do not think that any greek will accept to help the innocent people that will flee their country because of your games, 
   the thing you do not understand is that because the exams are so important , that 's what makes the strike effective . 
  when you go on a strike , ** you choose the day that will have the most consequences , as a way to make your point ** . 
  your rationale dictates that everyone would choose to strike in ways that have no consequences at all , but that would only weaken their negotiating position . 
  you are wrong here . 
  it was n't the teachers that chose to go on strike right now but the goveremnt that chose to pass all these measures now to provoke the teachers and make it almost impossible for them to react, 
  let me rephrase : bulgaria has the lowest wages in europe and one of the worst economies in europe, 
  i guess thats why the bulgarian economy is in a good state, 
  yes , but with the way we chose to save the banks , its the banks of the periphery that get nationalised/sold to bigger banks and the banks eg of germany or france avoid any state intervention, 
  i prefer the word skopjans for such cases . 
  it is a shame that you destroyed some very important arguments with your provocative way, 
  if you watched what the parties of southern europe say , you would realise that only minor parties or really populist jouranlists call merkel `` der f\u00fchrer '', 
  i stoped reading your response after the word fyromians, 
  is that a threat ? 
  well said . 
  i tottaly agree with this article . 
  it is very informative and we really need another such a great article to describe how greek people feel for this whole mess, 
  if that was the case , they would have voted yes right away to everything the troika wanted, 
  you mean like that ? 
   within the club the greek-cypriot government has used and abused eu institutions to wage its feud with turkey and to lend support to russia . 
  is it only me or this sounds like cyprus has invaded turkey, 
  some proof would be helpful, 
  and something more : as this is n't ourageous enough some idiots broke in and destroyed everything in the facilites threatening to kill the security gurads : http://english.capital.gr/news.asp?id=1732889, 
  a very important part from the ending of the video : the opposition speculates that the major mr pachtas ( ex minister with pasok , the 2nd party in the goverment coalition and champion in coruption ) made it so easy for the canadian company to get the mine because he was either bribed or wants something in return . 
  the journalist meets the major and asks him directly if it is true and he drives the journalist out . 
  the video claims that when they came in touch with someone from the canadian company they responded that the major wanted them to employ some specific people but they said they could n't do that, 
  they mock you because you are conservative about your ugly language :p, 
  it is the first time someone called me ( or compared me to ) a neonazi . 
  you made my day . 
  here is an upvote, 
  | aesthetically nice i 'd call english an ugly language compared to german, 
  several million of greek people identiy themselves as macedonian as well . 
  can we just ignore that ? 
  that 's minor stuff really . 
  i just found this awsome info [ here ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/macedonian_nationalism#post-independence_period_and_antiquisation )  for example , in 2009 the macedonian radio-television , aired a video named `` macedonian prayer '' in which the christian god was presented calling the people of the republic of macedonia `` the oldest nation on earth '' and `` progenitors of the white race '' , who are described as `` macedonoids '' , in opposition to negroids and mongoloids '', 
  he is 20, 
  i hope we can stop buying germans weapons now, 
  [ here you are ] ( http://www.toxwni.gr/media/k2/items/cache/88431b5dd05b1e90847e42adef0f6769_l.jpg ), 
  it would be more interesting to know what caused the natality rate to drop in germany the latest decades, 
  these links should give some insight : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jus_soli https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jus_sanguinis ** tl ; dr : from what i understand , what samaras wants to do is switch back to jus sanguinis which is what all european countries do **, 
  this reminds me [ this monstrosity ] ( http://s.enet.gr/resources/2013-01/23-1--2-thumb-large.jpg ) in the centre of athens, 
  from what i understand , the plan of the troika is to make the the debt sustainable after the following conditions are met : 1 ) yet another haircut this time on the debt held by european states ( that 's what the imf demands ) 2 ) high growth rates of the gdp ( this will begin by mass privatizations ) 3 ) structural reforms that will stop coruption and mismanagement in the public sector that will reduce the expenses and increase the income imo these are very hard conditions and still very optimistic, 
  all these three letter abbreviations are really confusing, 
   i left when i was 16 . 
  got a job that 's very important in order for someone to leave home . 
  when youth unemployment is extremely high , you do n't have many choices, 
  of course . 
  as the article above says , deficits are always the workers ' fault, 
  and guess who is going to pay ( again ) to fill the deficit created by these projects !, 
  i wonder why these politicians ca n't get prosecuted ( both in germany and greece ) for such scandals, 
  get ready to get downvoted without any explanation for telling what most bulgarians and greeks believe ( and imo it is the truth ), 
  then someone forgot to remind that macedonia is an area that spans among three countries but greece spans through one country, 
  no , it 's not just about our ancestors . 
  many of our neighbours claim that the greek part of macedonia is theirs and this is the real issue, 
  [ this ] ( http://elora.gr/portal/images/stories/2008_02/macedonia%20prime%20minister.jpg ) no matter how many times our neighbours assure us that they do n't intend to steal anything from us ( greek teritory , etc. . ) , everytime i see this picture i doubt about their intentions edit : that 's nicola gruevski ( the prime minister of fyrom ) wreath under a map that depics fyrom with its borders a bit extended, 
   athens next week will be 19c where did you find this ? 
  it is 10c right now and it will fall even more next week . 
  and the comparison is plain wrong as athens is among the warmest places in greece . 
  this is the best part of the article  greece 's oil prices are high because of laws that protect the country 's two refining companies and prevent competition , said pavlos eleftheriadis , a lecturer in law at the university of oxford in england , who studies monopolies . 
    `` the greek political system works for the insiders , '' said eleftheriadis , a native of greece . 
  `` if you 're an insider , there will be an attempt to protect you . 
  if you 're a poor person in kastoria , you are on your own . '', 
  i wonder if they intend to treat them in the same way they treat the agia sophia, 
  the flag next to your name makes your answer really ironic, 
  the cuts were n't savvage ? 
  perhaps when unemployment reaches 30 % they will be considered to be savage, 
  of course it would not have happened out of kindness . 
  what i was meaning was that the phrase `` when they allied with nazis and invaded polan '' tells only half of the story . 
  you show it as if ussr and nazi germany were best buddies . 
  time for some fact checking : http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/russia/3223834/stalin-planned-to-send-a-million-troops-to-stop-hitler-if-britain-and-france-agreed-pact.html?fb, 
  this was a better gem : underage with a nude picture of himself is in danger to go to jail because where he lives underage people are treated as adults for felonies , so he will be treated as a grown up for committing a felon against his underage self . 
  that would be a suicide . 
  new democracy was founded following the restoration of democracy ( hence the name ) after the military coup ( which was headed by ultra right wing collonels ) . 
  creating a coalition with gd would really question what their party stands for ( right wing and democratic ) . 
  even the newspaper funded by syriza polled the difference to be 0 and 2 % a second time . 
  imo it looks like merkel waited for migrants to reach germany first and then take any actions to improve the situation . 
  because it is very easy to call her a nazi if she asked the police to start border checks beforehand . 
  i only hope that the new rules will be enough to solve the crisis but judging from how the greek crisis is handled i am sure that the response will be too-little and too-late . 
  personally i do n't give a shit . 
  if thousands of people land on an island they and they demand a ticket to mainland when all tickets are booked dont deserve any of our help . 
  we are in a mess and the ability to support those people is extremely low .

  perhaps we should refer to south east turkey as kurdistan . 
  we will never accept it cause it 's not about the name . 
  do n't you see it ? 
  they are creating a falsified history . 
  they are claiming our heritage as theirs . 
  look what their ex-prime minister says about the matter : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fklkmw_au5i perhaps you ca n't understand what it means for us cause your nation doesnt have any truly historical memory . 
  any history whatsoever by comparison . 
  we on the other hand speak nowadays a language that is about 100 % the same as the one the bible was written . 
  yes !, 
  it remained the same for 2000 years . 
  so be informed before you form a view on the matter . 
  pah !, 
  it 's not about a fucking name . 
  i guess it 's not easy for you to grasp . 
  look at this : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fklkmw_au5i, 
  funny how easily you say `` they took the languages '' as this is something easily done . 
  on the other hand some people did n't lose their language - in fact they have it virtually the same since hellenistic times - yet everyone is the same and all have the same rights in historical context . 
  sure you have history . 
  not the one some people in your country try to make you believe though . 
  you are a slavic people , speaking a slavic language very close to bulgarian and until the late 19th century your own people would kill any of you that claimed to be `` macedonian '' . 
  can you get bothered with the fact that they alter your history too ? 
  half of your national historical figures , they claim they are `` macedonians '' . 
  no , what is retarded is that they try to build a nation on propaganda , falsifying history and ultranationalism . 
  they do n't pretend they are the only americans though . 
  what you miss is the constant effort they do to falsify history . 
  they do it with greek history , they do it with the bulgarian history too . 
  it 's not only about `` a '' name . 
  thank you !, 
  and we should call finland something like `` russia 's next province '' or `` ex russian , next russian province '' :d now you too have a stupid name that you do n't want . 
  well something `` plastic '' ( faux ) is appropriate for them . 
  you think so ? 
  that it 's only about butthurt ? 
  and you state that as a fact ? 
  gosh !, 
  well check it out . 
  you 'll find out that the french agreed for uk to be a member of the eu only if they did n't use `` britain '' in their name . 
  yes , it was because of bretagne . 
  too late !, 
  guess why uk became an eu member under the name united kingdom , and not great britain or britain . 
  go ahead check it out !, 
  are you serious ? 
  blaming this on merkel is one of the dumbest things . 
  as if there were n't illegal crossing before merkel said anything . 
  if one 's to blame this is the turkish government that uses that people to push their own agenda . 
  i think you 've missed the news . 
  they literally beg them to get on the busses to relocated them in camps around the country . 
  they refuse to do so , on the hope that the borders will open again . 
  exactly !, 
  a manipulative dictator of the shittiest order . 
  hence everything he build did n't last after his death . 
  yeah yeah right . 
  you should get your shit together dude . 
  it 's ridiculous what your nationalistic governments are trying to do . 
  do you believe their shit ? 
  only at the southern part of your country as it seems . 
  some almost right on the borders . 
  and all of them are mentioned as greek ones ... hmmm interesting . 
  is there anything ancient , around your capital skopje ? 
  i mean something ancient that dates before the 1990s . 
  lol do you even read what they write about them ? 
  bilota is one of the oldest cities on the territory of the republic of macedonia , having been founded as ** heraclea lyncestis ** in the middle of the 4th century bc by philip ii of macedon . 
  heracles lyncestis also spelled herakleia lynkestis ( greek : \u1f29\u03c1\u03ac\u03ba\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1 \u039b\u03c5\u03b3\u03ba\u03b7\u03c3\u03c4\u03af\u03c2 ; macedonian : \u0425\u0435\u0440\u0430\u043a\u043b\u0435\u0430 \u041b\u0438\u043d\u043a\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0441 ; latin : heraclea lyncestis ) , was an ancient greek city [ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] perhaps hercules ( the city was named after him : heraclea ) was a slav too ? 
  the earliest inhabitants of the widest lake ohrid region were the dassaretae , an ancient greek tribe [ 11 ] [ 12 ] and the enchelei , an illyrian tribe . 
  [ 13 ] during the roman conquests , towards the end of 3rd and the beginning of 2nd century bc , the dassaretae ** and the region dassaretia ** were mentioned , as well as the ancient greek city of lychnidos ( greek : \u039b\u03c5\u03c7\u03bd\u03b9\u03b4\u03cc\u03c2 ) . 
  [ 15 ] the existence of the ancient greek city of lychnidos is linked to the greek myth of the phoenician prince cadmus who , banished from thebes , in boeotia , fled to the enchelei [ 16 ] and founded the town of lychnidos on the shores of the modern lake ohrid . 
  [ 17 ] i wo n't go on ... 
  do n't know of any such reports . 
  so how many ancient macedonian cities exists in fyrom ? 
  lol phillip the ii conquered many lands . 
  did n't change their names into `` macedonia '' . 
  you do n't know what you are talking about . 
  read some history 1st . 
  you 'll be amazed to find out that during phillips and alexander 's time , that region was not called macedonia . 
  perhaps he is implying that the language we speak nowadays is the same that was spoken in hellenistic times . 
  lol, 
  we do n't hate each other mate . 
  we are fine with albanians !, 
  lol do you even know what are you talking about ? 
  do you even know why they built all those kitschy statues ? 
  do you even know that they are using the name to alter history ? 
  can you be so naive ? 
  but do n't listen to me . 
  listen to the former prime minister of fyrom , ljub\u010do georgievski : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fklkmw_au5i, 
  i know mate but what they are doing is hilariously stupid . 
  they try to falsify a well documented history . 
  they 'd have a better chance claiming they were the real `` kardashians '' lol, 
  lol you are so pathetic !, 
  being slavs doesnt give them the right to falsify history . 
  it 's not only about the name  they also deserve to join both the eu and schengen . 
  by what criteria ? 
  for building a fence ? 
  lol, 
  you tell them that neighbor . 
  you and us are the oldest inhabitants in the area . 
  all others came many centuries later . 
  so what 's the need for the false history ? 
  the false kitschy reconstruction ? 
  that land btw was not called macedonia in ancient times . 
  certainly not during alexander 's rein . 
  why all the propaganda then ?

  it is nice to be snide but even better to be properly informed . 
  you can check it out yourself why a privately owned debt became a public owned one . 
  google is your friend you can use it if you want it . 
  `` leaked minutes of imf meetings in 2010 show that argentina , brazil , india , russia and switzerland all argued that some greek debt owed to private banks should be cancelled before any bailout from the institution . 
  in documents released by the wall street journal , ** these countries and others argued that imf loans would actually bail out private european banks , leaving greece in debt and an even worse economic situation . 
  this is exactly what has happened ; ** greece 's economy is now in its sixth year of recession , the government 's foreign debt has increased to 180 per cent of gdp and one-in-ten of the population now live in extreme poverty . '', 
  http://jubileedebt.org.uk/blog/leaked-imf-documents-show-global-opposition-lenders-bank-bailout so i 'm terribly sorry that this is n't my fault !, 
  blind hate is not justified for any reason whatsoever and has nothing to do with someone 's government but rather on another one 's own narrow mind . 
  i know what happened to latvia in the 90s etc. 
  what has that got to do with anything but petty feelings ? 
  latvia 's or romania 's cases have nothing to do with greece 's . 
  you were part of the soviet pack , we were n't . 
  in fact we did have a war , a bloody civil war straight after the wwii , exactly because we did n't want to be part of the eastern bloc . 
  as for `` cowardice '' and the rest you mention like `` y' all wanted to live like in the west without having the engine for it '' , it is obvious that you know and understand nothing on the situation . 
  nothing whatsoever . 
  so i wo n't even try . 
  i will only give you a hint : in the west where now you are new members , nothing is as clear cut as was in the soviet times . 
  it is never `` this or that '' . 
  it will take time but eventually you 'll come to realize it . 
  thanks too for the wishes . 
  thank you very much !, 
  it is like this though ? 
  was greece really given a choice ? 
  have n't you heard that even the imf acknowledged their mistake ? 
  have n't you heard how many members in the imf ( brazil was one ) at the start of the bail outs , protested and they stated that `` the program is to save private banks on expense of greece '' ? 
  and what tax payers money are you talking about ? 
  that was n't greece 's fault . 
  greece owned to private banks . 
  also about the tax payers money ... 
  the bailout is just eurobonds printed money not peoples actual money . 
  just debt, 
  thank you for your good spirit . 
  you see what we are facing , something much worse than the economic hardship : blind hate . 
   / r/doctomoe : good . 
  let 's close the borders to greece and offer their seat to turkey . 
  oh god that again . 
  no one on the planet will ever pay their debts !, 
  no one !, 
  they are `` servicing '' their debts by rolling them . 
  aka taking new loans to pay the old ones . 
  greece 's rolling of its debt was interrupted by the american crisis . 
  that it all to it . 
  again !, 
  out of proportion and hardly the reason of the current mess . 
  see how many other countries did the same and are now in deep mess . 
  hardly because of that though . 
  you are right that calling for a referendum atm is wrong . 
  it is not moronic though . 
  look at it this way : syriza sold the narrative that they will end austerity cause they are right and they can make the others ( troika ) to see things their way . 
  unfortunately enough people ( for many reasons ) bought the fairy tale . 
  now syriza fucked up to gigantic proportions . 
  how can they save face and not look like the complete idiots they are ? 
  play the democracy thing . 
  in reality they throw the hot potato to citizens hands . 
  i am not saying that many things they asked troika all these months were n't right . 
  they were . 
  even the last proposal was in fact just kicking the can down the road and not a true solution to the problem . 
  but this referendum is their way out ... of the blame . 
  i sincerely hope they wo n't . 
  not in the next few days but anytime soon . 
  alas check how many countries at the moment have a greater debt as a percentage of the gdp , than greece had when the storm started . 
  what a short sighted interpretation of reality using an overblown fact !, 
  `` the requirement that the 1999 budget deficit should have been ** below 3 % of gdp ** was one of the key criteria for eurozone entry ; thus , its revision to 3.1 % , ** the precise figure was actually 3.07 % , ** according to eurostat ( ameco ) , led to a controversy about greece 's admission . 
  in the 2005 oecd report for greece ( p. 47 ) it was clearly stated that `` the impact of new accounting rules on the fiscal figures for the years 1997 to 1999 ranged from 0.7 to 1 percentage point of gdp ; this retroactive change of methodology was responsible for the revised deficit exceeding 3 % in 1999 , the year of emu membership qualification '' . 
  the above has led the greek minister of finance to clarify that the 1999 budget deficit was below the prescribed 3 % limit when calculated with the esa79 methodology in force at the time of greece 's application , and thus , since the remaining criteria had also been met , was properly accepted into the eurozone . 
  esa79 was also the methodology employed to calculate the deficits of all other eurozone members at the time of their applications . '', 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/greek_financial_audit,_2004 so the original sin in this case was ** 0.7 % ** of the gdp !, 
  do you know how many countries done that , even to a greater degree ? 
  pah !, 
  some people are so willing to keep repeating the shit they heard on tv and pass judgment without even knowing what they are talking about . 
  that is so sad ... 
  exactly . 
  i do n't think any polls exist yet . 
  i do hope for a resounding yes for many reasons . 
  getting rid of tsipras & co too . 
  oh what a hypocritical sob . 
  as if the proposal that 's been put on the table by the troika was n't a death sentence postponed . 
  seriously ... tsipras & co + troika : fuck off !, 
  do you think that by emptying the atms during the weekend the public will calm down by monday and the bankrun wo n't happen at all ? 
  is n't what 's happening atm ( no pun intended ) a good indicator then ? 
  exactly !!!!, 
  do you wish to be continuously whipped ? 
  yes or no ? 
  - yes . 
  * \\* whip * / * - no . 
  * \\* whip * / * ( no one told you that if you say `` no '' the whipping stops ), 
  my feelings exactly ... 
  i feel let down both from my government ( s ) and by the eu . 
  everyone 's done a shitty job . 
  what to vote next sunday ? 
  - yes ? 
  how ? 
  the proposal on the table was only kicking the can down the road ... 
  i would be like a contemned waiting for his execution date to be postponed . 
  and what will this bring that it wo n't be worse than before ? 
  do they want my blessings to destroy me for good ? 
  the funny part is that everyone ( troika and tsipras ) must be feeling good for their part in this story ... at first i thought to draw a cock , but perhaps 4 cunts ( troika & our pm ) is better suited ... 
  thank you sir !, 
  it 's only in demonstrations we lose our cool . 
  `` my city '' it must be in your dreams then .

  it is part of my cultures and people 's history . 
  i embrace it . 
   whatever was brought was in favor of eu . 
  this is not how you make a fair negotiation . 
  the tc are not equals in these talks because they illegaly occupy the northern part of the island . 
  the official cyprus government on the other side is a legitimate and recognized eu member . 
   i mean , give me a break , if turks relied on what `` others '' found reasonable for them international law is international law . 
  we have moved on . 
  it is not the early 20th century anymore . 
   greece cares about cyprus not because there are greeks on it , which is what i mean . 
  that 's just a pretext . 
  greeks , both in mainland and in cyprus , cared about enosis ever since the dawn of time . 
  it precedes modern geopolitics . 
   it is largely geopolitics what makes someone european and not . 
  it is not geopolitics . 
  it is cultural . 
   russia is not european with the same reason of america . 
  they are both having their own geopolitical power poles which collide with europe 's . 
  as i said . 
  it is not geopolitical but cultural . 
  think of it this way . 
  australia is far east . 
  but is belong to the anglosphere because of the anglosaxon culture . 
  they are not asian or anything pacific related . 
   you lot literally wanted to genocide turkish cypriots and wanted to annex it to greece . 
  turkish cypriots dont want to be united with you [ this ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3c/ethnographic_distribution_in_cyprus_1960.jpg ) is a 1960 demographics map of the island . 
  i do n't think i need to add anything else . 
  after the greeks revolted against the british occupators it only made sense to try and reunite with the motherland . 
  the same anticolonial revolutionaries were the same people that promoted enosis . 
  the turks wanted to inflirtate the island and ignite tensions for geopolitical reasons . 
  this is why after the invasion of the island turkey sent turks over in order to turkify via population . 
   i know as a byzantine remnant it is your daily activity to curse ottomans and turkey , but let me tell you this . 
  search for my comments promoting hellenoturkism and reapproachment . 
  you would like to think that greeks hate you . 
  that comforts you . 
  but reality differs . 
   even if erdogan goes or dies today , turkey 's stance on cyprus will not change . 
  i did n't say anything about erdogan . 
  turkey 's expansionism policies precede erdogan . 
   what opportunities ? 
  have you been following the situation ? 
  i doupt it . 
  anastasiades even brought final maps . 
  maps that were ok with international law and the un . 
  it is akinci and his masters in ankara that halt progress . 
   everyone looks out for their own interests , let them be resources or whatever . 
  interests in one thing . 
  illegal occupation and support for an unrecognized pseudostate that disrupts borders and prevents military and energy related projects from taking place is not a healthy way of promoting your interests . 
   no one cares about cypriots , but only themselves . 
  since you say greeks only care about greek it makes sense for greeks to care for cypriots since they are greek . 
   americans are europeans americans were europeans . 
  after the revolution and their devotion to republicanism in contrast to european monarchies coupled with deism against divine right europe they changed . 
   basically anyone who writes with latin/cyrillic and hails jesus is european i did n't say that . 
  people speak french and hail jesus in africa . 
  that does n't make them european . 
  russian happens to be european though . 
  ever since kiev rus i ca n't think of something that disqualifies them . 
  i am talking about russia specifically . 
  i did n't generalize . 
  so no . 
  it is not broad . 
  russians are european even though they occupy a big part of eurasia . 
  everything from literature to the alphabet to religion russians are european . 
   we call them russian . 
  who calls the mongols russian ? 
  how do you manage to call originating near china european ? 
   still sounds like a scumbag to me ignorant maybe ? 
  for sure . 
  but we have to have in mind the nature of times and the attitudes towards god . 
  but i would n't call him a scumbag . 
  * but even if that makes him a scumbag * , his laissez faire point is highly inaccurate . 
  `` i disagree with nigel politically . 
  he is a scumbag . 
  let 's include him in a series with leopold ii '', 
  that is not my point . 
  you attribute the famine to his belief in laissez-faire economics while it is proven that that was an excuse used by critics of the free market in order to undermine it . 
  the real reason was the following two factors . 
  his malthusian believs and his idea about god punishing the irish . 
  we know for fact that it was n't his belief in laissez-faire because it did n't apply to other sectors and issues besides the irish . 
  it ca n't be `` laissez-faire for the irish , state intervention for the rest '' . 
  do you even [ marco rubio ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19zxjvnm5gs ) ? 
  the real master of the art of drinking water . 
  this is so biased ... 
  this guy is responsible for one of the most effective civil service reforms . 
  his irish famine situation has more to do with his malthusian ideas about population reduction rather than laissez-faire . 
  not to mention his idea about the famine being god sent in order to punish the irish . 
  who do we know that the laissez-faire excuse is just an excuse ? 
  because the government of russell was in fact utilizing an active state with many public works and civil service reforms . 
  almost half a million irish found a job working at the newly founded public projects . 
  not to mention that the russell government limited factory work hours and pass a public health act . 
  i do n't think there will be any progress in these talks anytime soon . 
  the ~ ~ ottomans ~ ~ turks in their expansionist and neo-ottoman mentality want to legitimize the illegal occupation and the pseudostate at the north so that they can annex it later on . 
  or at least have a puppet state established on the island . 
  they will be no compromise . 
  president anastadiades gave them many opportunities during these past months . 
  let 's not kid ourselves . 
  they are not interest in reunification or the well being of cypriots . 
  turkey is looking for a long term landgrab . 
  fun info time ( * history nerd mode on * ) : this is said to be the attack lead by the man who would become pm of greece , * constantine canaris * .

  [ right now they are estimated to be about 1-2 months away from closing the bailout negotiations ] ( http://greece.greekreporter.com/2017/03/29/greece-reaches-agreement-with-creditors-to-close-bailout-program-evaluation/ ) , as greece has made the final concessions on labor and pension reforms . 
  also even during the worst economic crisis in the western world , greece managed to hit record tourist numbers last 3-4 years in a row , every year . 
  this is just icing on the cake . 
  already making major deals [ fraport greece signs 30-year contract with dufry for duty free shops ] ( http://greece.greekreporter.com/2017/03/27/fraport-greece-signs-30-year-contract-with-dufry-for-duty-free-shops/ ), 
  i am not sure which unit the `` economic police '' is from but i think it is a new tax/corruption force created by the finance ministry last year . 
  note that trump 's chief of staff is greek and was the person who introduced trump in the white house ceremony few days ago . 
  99.999999999 % chance that whoever comes after erdogan will be more extreme and totalitarian , they chose their path and now it is set . 
  most importantly we need to deal with kim-jundogan next door , eu is literally being bullied around by some tin-pot dicator who has already said he would use his millions of followers to wreak havoc within europe as sleeper agents . 
  at the very least we can not allow turkey to blackmail europe for eternity , otherwise it will fall apart within 10-20 years max . 
   anybody knows why we call bulgarians big heads ( like pshisically big head ) i think a `` square '' type of head is fairly common in bulgaria , something which is more common in central europe than compared to common mediterannean head shape which is more rounded . 
  when i see a greek person with a large square-shape head and no beard i usually assume they have bulgarian ancestry . 
   if you want to be under russian occupation again russia will never step foot into europe as an invading force , there are these things called nukes now . 
  ukraine fucked up and got rid of theirs and did not join nato after they did . 
  bulgaria does not have this concern , europe as a whole would aide bulgaria if it needed since we are under treaty to do so , ukraine had no such treaty and was fucked over , unfortunately for them . 
  we do n't need any of that when it really comes down to it . . it would be nice i suppose but `` need '' ? . 
  absolutely not . 
  greece has the key to pull in israel and egypt into eu allies since they are already allies with greece , and those are the two most important players in mena . 
  gas pipeline project between greece , israel , cyprus and egypt is also in the works sponsored by eu . 
  us scoundrels need to stick together . 
  yeh , it requires some trimming but not to much . 
  he is absolutely right , the moment migrants realize they can not just step into europe and get welfare the migration flows will stop . 
  if every single migrant was placed on a cruise ship to be processed before stepping foot on european soil , the migration numbers would crumble and erdogan would lose his leverage on europe . 
  this allows genuine refugees to still come into europe which i am ok with , i just want them to processed and assigned a country . 
  it 's funny how eastern europeans refuse to work with anyone on refugee issue and spit on eu 's face when this comes up for discussion but italy and greece are supposed to obey russian sanctions and tow the line even though it has a massive negative impact on both our economies , in this already hard economic times . 
  absolute bullshit . 
  the only country that could enforce a kurdish state is usa and they are still backing erdogan , although things could change if erdogan goes full dictator and turns to russia . 
  this is interesting to me since that beard style is still very popular in greece , [ as you can see from this greek model ] ( http://www.hommerworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/slide_homepage_1240x800.jpg ) . 
  it is pretty fascinating that some fashion trends just never go away i suppose . 
  you can tell just from the picture he must have been a giant , must of been a legendary fighter . 
  which turkish minorities are seeking independence outside of turkey ? 
  also most of that `` native '' kurdish land is stolen from armenia who lived there for thousands of years . 
  i am not saying kurds do n't deserve their own state but calling it native is a bit of a stretch . 
  this is assuming greece did not have access to schengen , you make it sound like greece would have absolutely no issues without schengen which is not the case . 
  yeh but for tourists in greece to go back to their home country would be a pain in the ass so most would rather go the more simple route and not travel to greece . 
  it would have been a doomsday scenario for greece . 
  i do n't get your original point then , the only reason that greece is not a giant favela right now is because of access to the single market . 
  the ease of travel for european tourists to enter greece and easy access of european markets by greek companies is the only reason greece is not a complete hell-hole right now . 
  i do n't think you understand how important the single market and easy travel is to an economy . 
  if greece had a capable government post-euro entry it would be a fairly wealthy country right now due to access of the single market , it was greek government fault not eu for reason everything went so bad . 
  because greek government spent hundreds of billions irresponsibly after greece received artificially low interest rates in the few years following the euro currency .

  the british pound is still as strong as ever ( in reputation ) and the royal family has god knows how many trillions in real estate and other investments around the world , i really do n't think it is technically possible for britain to ever truly go bankrupt like a country like greece could . 
   bret hart ... canadian * you forgot the greatest canadian to ever live, 
  ozil will score 3 own goals next game and become president of turkey following the game . 
  turkey would never join due to the voting bloc nature of the eu parliament , which would make turkey more powerful than germany/france in all eu matters . 
  erdogan 's plan all along was to be dictator , so it makes sense to use the eu as an external enemy . 
   [ recently , even city authorities have gotten in on the act , as they have sought to capitalize on graffiti 's more artistic offshoots by handing out permits to encourage street artists to paint murals in blighted public spaces .

  greece has the largest air-force and tank force in europe . 
  that should tell you how small most nations militaries are considering some countries are 10x the size of greece , so most countries do need more tanks and rockets . 
  but the key to a eu military is communication , satellites and network communication and sharing of intelligence is the key , european space agency could be the blueprint for a wider european military . 
  beware of greeks bearing ~ ~ gifts ~ ~ mail, 
  it 's not trolling , people have gotten hurt before and i think there has been a death , but i am not sure if by bomb or arson . 
  that is really fucked up , there are a lot of left-wing extremists in greece who do this type of shit constantly . 
  i really think scots should wait 5-10 years for the next referendum to see how things pan out . 
  if they do a referendum so quickly and then it again loses . 
  that is it for 2-3 generations ( or maybe not , i do n't know ) . 
  is varoufakis in town ? 
  i really think keepass is the best , very simple to use . 
  i keep a backup save file on a usb stick also , it is nice knowing my passwords ca n't get hacked ( at least i hope ) . 
  good point , that is why it is a complex issue . 
  but on the other hand from my experience paying close attention to negotiations during grexit crisis . 
  is that many of these eu figure-heads are very emotional people , not as `` calculated '' as you would assume for such high positions . 
  negotiations are going to be a roller-coaster , i know this for a fact , and a lot of hatred will be spewed back and forth , this is why it is so hard to predict the outcome , it could go both ways . 
  it is pretty simple to make an unhackable password , get [ keepass ] ( http://keepass.info/download.html ) , let it auto-generate a 32 or 64 character password and then copy/paste password when needed . 
  this also prevents keyloggers ( recording keyboard clicks ) . 
  a really smart asshole, 
   unknown attackers have gained access to thousands of twitter accounts , spreading hostility against the netherlands and germany . 
  also on verified accounts of numerous german and international celebrities found on wednesday morning news of identical tweets in turkish language with the hashtags #nazialmanya and #nazihollanda . 
  yeh and varoufakis was prepared to , he had a nice million euros hidden under his bed and a nice book deal waiting . 
  ask tsipras . 
  yes they are in the exact same position . 
  what greece lacks in economic power it makes up for as being the most important geo-policial located nation in the eu as it is the access point to the eastern med and through cyprus the middle east . 
  eu was willing to sacrifice greece even though of this geo-political threat as greece may have turned to russia post-grexit and caused chaos in the eu . 
  even then merkel was willing to kick greece out . 
  economic wise , it is likely in germany 's long-term interest to destroy uk 's economy , germany/ireland would absorb all the london financial service businesses and a weakened uk is good for germany/france . 
  i am not saying they will do anything but do n't be surprised if negotiations do n't go as planned and in fact turn into a war-like situation . 
  islam is evolving to be more extreme , the wahabi movement is only a little over a century old and modern extremist islam is a product of the last 20-30 years and it looks to be getting worse every year . 
  there is absolutely no signs of islam being more progressive , but in fact every single sign shows that it is becoming more regressive and defensive as it sees the non-islamic world as a threat . 
  not really , but the s-400 is an extremely complex unit using dozens of radar types , some of them classified ( allegedly ) . 
  they will likely sell an export version of the s-400 like they sold an export version of s-300 to greece which is not as powerful as the ones in russia . 
  you think it is having some kind of `` desired effect '' , it 's not . 
  merkel/hollande have complete power in negotiations and it might be in their interest for negotiations to go bad , both sides are not showing their cards yet . 
  edit : reason i say this is because this current ordeal reminds me a lot of the tsipras bailout negotiations when he first came into office , he did a lot of things to create a `` desired effect '' but it accomplished nothing but hurt greece , in the end he finally understood and listened to merkel . 
  i think he realized that merkel was more than willing to kick greece out of the euro and for greece to turn to shit in order to show other countries what happens when you cross the eu . 
  no problem , it really is an amazing island , and if you stay longer than a week you can take a weekend boat trip to the nearby island of kos , the capital there is very lively . 
  for rhodos , definitely visit palia poli ( old city ) in rhodos town , and lindos is probably one of the best beaches on earth with some nice ancient monuments around , faliraki town is a pretty fun party town , also has the largest waterpark in europe and some really fun beach parties every afternoon . 
  one thing though is to not get on motorcycles at night , it can be a bit dangerous . 
  rhodos , visit lindos and rhodos town for monuments and museums , and beaches are everywhere . 
  yeh but just because erdogan `` made peace '' with putin and israel does not mean much for the citizens who feel insulted by his actions . 
  just because putin decided this week to unblock the visa ban to turkey does not mean russian tourists will suddenly flock back , it will take a lot of energy and resources to accomplish that . 
  greece and albania will just stay quite about this whole affair for the most part , turkey wants to build a pipeline into albania through greece so both governments will not say much to cause tensions . 
  you can be both tbf . 
  [ the dutch reaction after hearing this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgtsa18z3wc ), 
  ( also we must ignore he was the main figure-head behind the armenian , assyrian and greek genocides ), 
  greece will likely send in special forces as it has done before in situations like this .

  how about neither marine or monsieur ` vous etes du racaille ' there are other options than these 2 . 
  we are comparing uneven countries though and ignoring significant historic developments . 
  usa was a gigantic industrial power , greece has little to none industry . 
  usa had an exceptionally charismatic president in the form of fdr , who wasnt afraid to engage controversial politics at the time and his 100 days program is simply a huge fit of economic measures . 
  and last but not least , the advent of ww2 , the total industrial mobilisation and war gearing of the us economy really propelled em to be the most powerfull economic nation in just 20 years after the crash on 29 ' . 
  we are ready to be bribed and go overdebt to replace our leopards aswell . 
  throw some subamarines aswell but make sure they go only backwards . 
  720 isnt bad here either ... nowadays anyways , in fact its pretty good . 
  sorry if my post sounded sarcastic . 
  720 euros , wow . 
  the sad thing is , although its the logical thing to do , by getting the money out of the bank , the bank has liquidity issues , asks for more money from the ecb . 
  people see that banks have issues , go get out more money and the cycle of doom continues . 
  and carry a geiger counter for good measure , polonium is a terrible death . 
  it would be a suicide if they try to pass it as a common law , rebellion would happen and i dont think they can even pass it as a law through the parliament . 
  i think it would require a constitution change and the vote block would be much different then . 
  they are at 30-40 % popular , hardly enough to attempt such a gigantic change . 
  and half of their voters want to stay on the eurozone , so syriza support on leaving the eurozone would have been extremely limited . 
  prepares to exit euro , more clickbait please . 
  bullshit , syriza cant decide on leaving or staying on euro without either new elections or a referendum . 
  and trust me the average greek can easily deduce on who is to blame . 
  the majority wants to stay on eurozone , syriza was elected on the promise that we would stay while still doing a better negociation ( they are pretty terrible at even arguing with themselfs , but thats another story ) as you said only 35 % voted for them , they dont have the power to make a drastic decision and they certainly cant put a smokescreen about who is to blame . 
  greek production is close to nonexistant , our exports are exceptionally low compared to our imports . 
  you say olives and oil , but most of our bulk production gets shipped to italy and rebranded there . 
  industry doesnt exist , our pimary economy is tourism and possibly the second largest maritime trade fleet . 
  so having a cheap currency while could be somewhat lucrative with teh flow of dollars/euros/yen via tourism doesnt really benefit the economy on the long run . 
  the current government was voted on the basis that we will remain on the euro no matter what . 
  the vast majority of the people want to remain in the eurozone , there is no way the government will make the decision to go back to drachma without either a referendum or new elections . 
  syrio = benjen = strong belwas = victarion, 
  so imf is the iron bank ? 
  they always get their due . 
  there were crimes commited and money that went through us , swiss authorites collaborated on the arrests and on the extradiction procedure . 
  honestly it needs to be done properly , we created the libya mess afterall . 
  any action must be planned very thoroughly to avoid repeating the mistakes of the gaddafi operation . 
  because that went so well last time . 
  4months . 
  close all ports , shoot down all planes . 
  our olive oil is the last thing we have , please dont let it spread here . 
  ( that being said its mostly our oil that gets exported to italy and rebranded there , so we are propably safe ) ty . 
  half the eu lied to get into the eurozone , germany didnt include the east germany debt , italy did cooking and questionable accounting . 
  also the muppets recieved 35 % , not an asbolute majority , its our stupid electoral law that allows em to get an almost full majority . 
  most of the bailout money was used to pay the debts which in turn created new debts . 
  potential death day for us one day before d-day . 
  well that favors the major europe exporters . 
  see even on the verge of abyss we help europe .

  there was no way he could have kept the swedish throne , the protestant parliament didnt want a catholic monarch . 
  hence why his uncle took the throne . 
  yes and that lead to a very brutal swedish-polish war on matter of succession and occupation of lands on livonia ( modern baltics ) . 
  man a crazy what if scenario is if it was succesfull , scotland would have total control of pacifc-atlantic trade routes and possibly built a panama like canal earlier . 
  imagine the politics of central and south america if a colombia sized english speaking colony existed . 
  imagine the haggis catapults . 
  to fight both germany and soviet union ? 
  the british middle east would have been steamrolled by the soviet armoured divisions before even rommel crossed the ardennes . 
  to play devil 's advocate here , chamberlain position was not that easy , public opinion on a potential new great war was definetely not desirable . 
  the catastrophic losses of the first world war had scarred an entire generation , apeasement may seem like a colossal error from our perspective but at the time the public was happy that a potential war was averted . 
  take a hike to olympus if you are into the mountains thing , as i can see there is still some snow on the top but the rest should be clear . 
  if you are done with thessalia , take the train and head to thessalonica , many stuff to see there . 
  just to be safe , stroll south ( k shameless self plug promotion off ) , honestly no idea of the situation , it seems media overblown . 
  easily venizelos , abandon the impossible idea of keeping smyrna and focusing efforts on keeping east thrace and maybe constantinople . 
  we had a strong navy , we could have kept the one side of the bosporus , instead of going deep into anatolia dreaming of past glories . 
  anything else were delusions of grandeur and waste of precious life and materials . 
  the trucks carrying weapons were just going on vacation to syria . 
  why you have to be so suspicious ? 
  look , the whole reparations thing was never settled properly but i dont ask for the 300 billion ridiculous sum . 
  there were never reparations for the survivors of the various massacres , except for the jews of thessalonica . 
  that could be settled for a few million only . 
  armed rebellion ? 
  say what ? 
  pff who cares , now unknown drones flying above french nuclear reactors , thats a story . 
  well the deadline is 5 june , they better be close to a deal soon , the 1.5 billion to imf isnt gon na be possible to pay . 
  to realize even how more tight the finances are going , the government asked the various greek embassies/consulates abroad to sent whatever reserve they have back home ( usually income from visas ) . 
  we need a deal and we needed it 4months ago . 
  good , we need a reliable nuclear fallout shelter for humanity to continue to exist . 
  they couldnt compete with cheaper production overseas on some cases , on other cases there was a vast investment and relocation of production on former soviet union countries . 
  a good example of this is romania , take a look at how many romanian companies belong to a greek group ( rom telecom , chipita , etc ), 
  the whole reparations thing is a big discussion . 
  my personal opinion is this , reparations should be paid to the survivors of the various villages that were purged ( kandanos/kalavruta , etc ) .

maybe because greece was subjected to at least [ twice ] ( http://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/greece-government-reforms-by-yanis-varoufakis-2015-05 ) the austerity compared to portugal .

  the paper you showed me does not , by any means , contradict with what i said . 
  on the contrary , it fully supports my claims . 
  thanks for the paper , i was n't aware of that research . 
  first of all , the paper looks at * self-employed * people and estimates which industries are tax-evading the most . 
  their results correlate well with what i had in mind , which is , the biggest tax evaders in greece are the doctors and the lawyers ( p. 48 ) . 
  does this paper prove that the average greek is tax evading ? 
  does it prove that tax-evading is `` part of greek identity '' ? 
   the highest tax evaders are the highly educated and powerful professions in greece . 
  ( p. 36 ) the answer is no . 
  because : 1 ) most greeks ( 65 % ) are wage earners and can not tax-evade , and 2 ) from those that are self-employed , the majority of tax evaders ( by mean value of tax evasion ) are in specific ( well known ) industries that are characterized by very high incomes . 
  do you agree with me or not ? 
  even if we accept the numbers you 're presenting , and even if we all agree that 100 % of the greek debt is attributed to tax evasion , you 're still missing the point of my post . 
   the average greek does not tax evade . 
  a salaried employee can not do that . 
  the majority of tax evasion is from big corps , and rich guys like doctors and lawyers . 
  some small shop owners do that too , but that 's far from saying `` part of greek identity '' . 
  that 's what i said . 
  show me that the average greek is stealing from the state or has been historically doing that . 
  where did you read that only 32 % of taxes are collected ? 
  where were you between 11.30 and 11.45 this morning ? 
   only thing we can blame on the ordinary greeks are that they have elected corrupt officials . 
  and i think most greeks will agree with you . 
  but then again younger greeks had no part in this , they just found themselves in the `` middle of the war '' . 
  yeah , i 'm sure when someone blames lazy/corrupted/tax evading greeks is referring to the tsipras government . 
  i have no reason to take it personally . 
   it 's only greece under syriza where it failed . 
  that 's not true . 
  check this [ post ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3djd22/greek_economy_was_not_doing_well_until_january/ ) . 
  i do n't know what others did , but i upvoted you . 
  indeed , that 's a fact , i read it somewhere a few years ago . 
  ** but ** . 
  that does not , by any means , prove the ridiculous statement that we read over and over again that greeks are tax evading . 
  the average greek does not , and can not , tax evade . 
  the corrupted politicians and the elite , on the other hand , are a different story ... 
  why do you assume that greeks started those hashtags , and more importantly , why do you assume that greeks or anybody in the world is using those hashtags to attack german people ? 
  almost all shops accept debit cards , but i 'm not sure what 's happening with credit cards these days . 
  basic commerce functions , but everybody is reluctant to use cash for taxis , cafeterias , subway etc. 
  i read somewhere that we are losing 1 % of gdp every week the banks are closed . 
   blame either goldman sachs who aided your politicians in cooking your books or your politicians we do blame * our * politicians for indebting us and starting the crisis of 2009 . 
  some of them are already in jail . 
  but we also blame * your * politicians for indebting us even further from 2009 to 2015 . 
  so far we are not blaming people of other countries , so i 'm not sure why you mention that . 
   what we currently have is the worst of both worlds , austerity with no actual reforms to go with them and loans taken out that are n't invested into infrastructure . 
  the only winners are the fat cats in the cities of london and frankfurt and the criminals at goldman sachs who caused this mess in the first place by cooking greece 's books . 
  i could n't agree with you more . 
  what ? 
   carefully ommiting the other points . 
  no , i just omitted the parts that are off-topic . 
  you are trying to start a discussion on every single thing that * you think * went wrong since the 70s , while this thread is about * tax evasion in 2015 * . 
   it 's not my fault that the majority subscribes to at least some of the describtions . 
  no , your fault is that you are blindly assuming that , without questioning whether you have enough data to make that assumption . 
  the majority of greeks are certainly not landlords , or self-employed , and even from those , not everybody are crooks !, 
  do n't generalize , it 's not nice . 
   as much as your biased view i 'm not the one who 's biased here my friend . 
  selectively picking events from the last 40 years of greek history and presenting them in a way that makes my nation look bad , * does not prove anything about vat tax evasion * , which is of course the topic of this thread . 
  this only proves that you 're biased . 
  aggressively trying to blame a whole nation for stuff is by definition racist . 
   typical leftist mentality i 'm not a leftist . 
   i bet even you ' v personally not taken a vat receipt or chosen the cheaper way for a service or good , but think it does n't really make a difference that 's the problem , you are just assuming stuff , while i 'm talking about the reality in greece for those in reddit that are interested to learn more . 
   small things add up really fast big things add up faster my friend ... 
   the majority of tax evasion is from big corps , and rich guys like doctors and lawyers . 
  i already said who are responsible for the majority of tax evasion . 
  putting the blame on the average greek is just ignorant and plain racist . 
   something all greeks do no , that 's not true . 
  simple as that . 
  no , that 's media bias . 
  trying to put the blame of the $ 320bn debt to the poor guy for not charging vat when selling tomatoes is ridiculous . 
  first of all , the average greek does not tax evade . 
  a salaried employee can not do that . 
  the majority of tax evasion is from big corps , and rich guys like doctors and lawyers . 
  some small shop owners do that too , but that 's far from saying `` part of greek identity '' . 
   60 % voted `` no '' and about 70 % want to stay in the euro . 
  yes , however the first number is from the referendum while the second number is from polls . 
  and we all know how accurate polls are ... 
  nevertheless , i understand that tsipras was between a rock and a hard place . 
   mp kyriakos mitsotakis , son of former prime minister konstantinos mitsotakis ... and brother of mp dora bakoyannis ... 
  the problem is not austerity . 
  the problem is a country with no prospect of recovery . 
  to answer your question , yes , this year changed everything ... 
   also is greece 52 % on agree that was in 2014 . 
  the percentage supporting a federation now is probably on par with the uk . 
  nope . 
  that big smile was the result of being served coffee by [ merkel ] ( http://www.iefimerida.gr/sites/default/files/tsipras-merkel-kafes-708.jpg ) . 
  that 's impossible . 
  / r/europe is irreversible . 
  now where can i borrow some reddit gold ... * edit : * thanks , gib more reddit gold !, 
  i do n't argue , but that 's what the article says ... 
   growing anger among some greeks over the coverage of the referendum , according to german news website focus , which one of the main gripes being that private broadcasters are too biased in their reporting . 
  even if we accept what you 're suggesting and 75 % of total pensioners are in the public sector and ika , the article says that 75 % of those enjoy early retirement , which is ~ 56 % of total pensioners ( 75 % of 75 % ) . 
  i confirm , title is misleading . 
  it should say : * 75 % of public sector and ika pensioners are opting for early retirement * . 
  after all the average age of retirement in 2012 was at [ 62 ] ( http://www.oecd.org/els/emp/ageingandemploymentpolicies-statisticsonaverageeffectiveageofretirement.htm ) . 
  i also want to note that : 1 . 
  i know many people that opted for early retirement during the last few years , in anticipation of troika increasing the retirement age .

just to give you people a sense of the utter unreality that is being constantly spewed towards the greek population from the greek establishment . 
  but syriza is `` anti '' - establishment . 
  eh , not really . 
  they were quite conservative and nationalistic but i would not call them nazi-like . 
  ( ignoring that golden dawn is full out hitler lovers and that papagos fought and was imprisoned by the germans ) i 'd say that the traditional right followed the ideological shift i described in the first post . 
  after all , conservatism does progress , just slowly . 
  golden dawn are nazis , period . 
   the inheritors of the nationalist right are chrysi avgi ( golden dawn ) what ? 
  absolutely not . 
  the leader of the greek army was led by alexandros papagos . 
  in 1951 he founded the `` greek rally '' party which won the elections . 
  when papagos died in 1955 , konstantinos karamanlis reformed the party into the national radical union . 
  after the junta in 1974 , he formed new democracy . 
  new democracy is still the ( moderate ) right wing party of greece . 
  well , these guys play on a whole different level . 
  please do list them to a petulant child . 
  then explain why refuges enter greece instead of , for example , bulgaria . 
  anyway , i 'm done arguing , my government is worthless and will be gone in a couple of months . 
  shame they will leave ruins behind them . 
  as i said , they had to create deterrents for immigrants trying to illegally enter greece . 
  but this is not in the agenda of a far-left populist government that was elected with an open border policy while at the same time chanting that greece has no sea borders . 
  i 'm sorry but i do n't think i am being unreasonable for complaining that my country has turned into a refuge camp run by dubious ngo 's instead of the greek government while complaining that fyrom is defending their borders . 
  if that makes me a petulant racist/far-right child , then so be it . 
   having a concrete proposal is hard . 
  no shit . 
  we expect the elected people to come up with solutions ( that 's their job ) rather than `` giving up and blaming everyone else ( be it in the form of eu/nato/imf / us ) but themselves '' . 
  edit : my pm finally complained about the dubious npo 's encouraging immigrants to work against the interests of greece ( he said the interests of the refugees to be precise ) . 
  my question is this : `` did you just realise this ? 
  what have you been doing about them ? '', 
   who told you that the other country will receive them ? 
  it 's not like you will drop them with a parachute !, 
  well , we have the deal with turkey right now . 
  we can prioritize these people over the rest . 
  though i guess turkey would instantly stop the agreed transfers . 
  regardless , the problem should not have escalated to this extent . 
   up to last month or so , everyone along with the rest of the eu encouraged them to get in and apply at their country of preference . 
  there is a legal path you know but you do n't sound like you 'd like 50k people applying for asylum in greece because that would mean that we 'd have to feed them and house them until they get accepted or rejected . 
  i had in mind applications directly from the camps in syria while ensuring that those that do enter greece illegally will have a much more difficult time . 
  ( this needed to be done eu-wide . ), 
   you mean to tell me that more deaths happened when the traffic was bigger ? 
  no shit sherlock !, 
  yeah sure , i bet that refugees learned that greece has open borders and suddenly started to get here ; please tell me that you are not one of those `` it is syriza 's fault for the whole immigration situation !, 
  merkel holds the main responsibility with her open invitation to refugees ; and the european union for their extremely slow reaction to the problem ... they should have been offering help to the greek government from the very beginning . 
  however , luckily for her , her country is not first in line . 
  blaming merkel and the rest ( for refugee and economic policies ) is quite easy but it is useless . 
  as greeks , we can only really talk about what greece should have done . 
  syriza should never have encouraged the refuges by their calls or by closing the refuge camps but they were the far-left populist party back then . 
   where would you put them ? 
  idomeni was the natural point like kalais in france since it was the last stop before entering fyrom and pireaus is the first place where they landed from the islands . 
  the vast majority of the rest are in camps . 
  piraeus is the main port of greece , surely you agreed that along with the airport , this is the last area that you gather them at right ? 
  especially when you have an investor ( cosco ) interested in the port . 
  i 'd be willing to be that the chinese ambassador ordered tsipras to empty their port before the deal was signed two days ago . 
  as for idomeni , the problem is that the greek government was too slow with limiting unregulated movement and reopening/creating closed refuge camps . 
  closed camps is not what i consider ideal but , given the numbers , its the only realistic option . 
   saying : `` all of them should be jailed '' is not realistic no , many of them are good people . 
  the ones breaking the law and threatening greeks ? 
  most certainly and then send back to where they came from . 
   saying that a water border can be impenetrable is also unrealistic . 
  did n't say this either . 
  but , as a government , you have to create deterrents for them to avoid pursuing this path while , at the same time , offering a legal path to apply for asylum . 
   in the past these issues were dealt with proper old-school violence of the `` so-what-if-a-child-dies '' variety ; more children have died since the `` greece has no borders/hey everyone , get in here/we 'll send jihadists to europe if the imf and eu do n't bend over '' policy was adopted . 
   btw , i bet that the whole financial situation of greece is tsipras ' fault !, 
  no , not all of it is . 
  nor did i ever state that . 
  --  it is everyone 's responsibility to know what kind of suggestions or actions are realistic or not . 
  well , i can tell you with quite a high certainty that the situation in idonemi and possibly piraeus are going to turn very ugly soon because far too many immigrants have gathered there . 
  in other words , they should never have been allowed to gather like this . 
  i am not a politician , you understand that right ? 
  it is not my responsibility ( or anyone on this subreddit really ) to come up with `` solutions '' . 
  however , our government holds responsibility for what is happening within our country . 
  they have failed on every single aspect of governance from the economy to the refugee crisis . 
  unless of course their intentions is something completely different from what i want . 
  if they are not incompetent , they chose for greece to be exactly in the state that it is today . 
  why am i the government ? 
  i certainly would make sure that parts of my country are not governed by ngos and illegal immigrants or refugees . 
  nor would i allow the trade routes to be blocked to this extent . 
  oh and i would n't be distributing `` we love you but please leave our main port '' leaflets . 
  you are the government !, 
  you do n't beg , you act . 
  but its ok ... 
  they `` refugees '' , we ca n't touch them . 
  name dispute aside ; as a greek , since my government is too pathetically incompetent or willing to do anything , i can not blame fyrom for taking the situation into their own hands ( and briefly crossing the borders ) . 
  i know that many people do not like this but , i 'm sorry , even if everyone was a syrian refugee ( they ai n't ) they still need to respect the rules of the country they are visiting or they wish to visit . 
  our government will be getting constant blowjobs while the few dissenters would get executed by the word of the supposedly `` charismatic '' populist pm . 
  ( every centrist and right wing supporter gets gibbed ; far right might survive due to kammenos ), 
  it should be to / u/die _ liebe at least since he brought up the holocause as an insult . 
  to the rest of us ? 
  absolutely not . 
  [ 25 megabits per second - recommended for ultra hd quality by netflix ] ( https://help.netflix.com/en/node/306 ) [ average speed in the us : 12.6 mbps with only 24 % over 15mbps ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_internet_connection_speeds ) basically you have it much better than most of the us , if you can play 4k without minutes of buffering . 
  also , bernie is an idiot . 
  having a higher average speed in the capital of a country than the average speed of a massive country is not comparable . 
  if he had compared the value to the average speed of romania in total , he might have had a point but he did not . 
  in the same way , i could idiotically start comparing my uk connection to google fiber in the us to start bitching . 
  when in truth , uk has a higher average speed with respectable connection speed to most households and no data caps . 
  nah , just a couple of months till next elections or a multi-party ( 4 + ) collaboration without tsipras as pm . 
  roman salute !, 
  we are the successor of the eastern roman empire after all . 
  well played . 
   even in lesvos you should be all-right , just avoid mitilini they are the same island ( technically mitilini is just the capital ) .

   i did n't encounter many people in my life who think like that . 
  that 's ok . people are different , which is another reason why the state should concern itself more with the economy ( especially for greece ! ), 
  and less with ideologies . 
  do you actually believe unemployment will go down with these improvements in automation ? 
  if you want to breed so that people can pay for your pension , be prepared to pay even more for their unemployment benefits because they ai n't getting a job anytime soon . 
  i think you missed mine . 
  you are correct that some people might think that , i just said these people are irrelevant . 
   well said . 
  i 'm baffled at how many people find the struggle to protect and prolong the existence of a nation meaningless . 
  its not so baffling man . 
  i am greek and by being an atheist i have effectively removed myself from the conservative greek nation . 
  so ... why would i care ? 
  i do n't want our state to ensure the survival of a stupid social construct i have no stake in . 
  i want the state to care about its people , its citizens , of which i am one , and not vague ideologies . 
  what / u/saltlets conveniently left out is that this sense of `` identity '' is a very narrow one and usually includes only the nationalists or the right wing in general . 
  so you understand why not everyone would be thrilled about defending a construct that ( in some cases , aggressively ) excludes them . 
  because its not his part . 
  there is no social contract that says you have to breed . 
  its not like we live in 1000ad or desperately need the manpower for any reason . 
  actually our part should be to breed less because , despite being overpopulated and ruining the earth , automation will make people even less needed . 
  you just proved his point . 
  i am sorry you are being downvoted because you expose the right wing violence . 
  it seems people only want muslim or immigrant violence to be visible . 
  anything else is unacceptable , even if it perfectly relates to this discussion . 
  that is some weird logic , more like utopianism . 
  either something is perfect and just the way i want it - or it sucks . 
  thankfully , reality is more nuanced . 
  you can have freedom of speech without being allowed to abuse and harass innocent people . 
  anyone who thinks that they are right only because they are persecuted is a political moron and should not be catered to . 
  seriously who are those people ? 
  are there people over the age of 16 who are willing to support and even vote for people ... because they are being persecuted ? 
  only a stupid teen edgelord would even consider this behavior . 
  does n't work like that . 
  i mean it would work like that , if europe was this secular progressive paradise that reddit pretends it is . 
  but in reality there are many people who all they want to do is scream `` trash '' and `` cattle '' at immigrants all day . 
  this guy is encouraging them and even giving them a platform to harass further . 
  [ they are even soliciting votes ] ( http://www.euractiv.com/section/justice-home-affairs/news/germany-s-right-wing-populists-join-hands-with-anti-islamist-pegida/ ) so they can institutionally harass and abuse the people they disagree with . 
  i 'm sorry but there is no tolerance paradox . 
  even if half the accusations they make are true ( i am being super generous ) its just trolling , there is no criticism or discussion , its just things like `` lucky paris being gifted with all this multiculturalism '' which is trolling and got banned just as i did . 
  i mean the same thing happened to me and i am as liberal as one gets . 
  difference is i do n't have my anti-europe sub to bitch about it . 
  if you want to criticize immigration you are free to do so as we see in literally every thread here on a daily basis . 
  its very common . 
  it is quite intense i admit . 
  what is it with everyone thinking the ethnically slavic former yugoslav state of macedonia conquered greece ? 
  i am very progressive ( look at my comment history ) but even i feel the butthurt over their propagandistic victory . 
  scratch one for rewriting history , i guess ? 
   i said when they wo n't defend themselves , not when they do n't want to defend themselves . 
  umm  europe is not willing to defend itself you did say that , and even if you did n't , it was a judgement , not a fact . 
  but i do n't want a long back and forth over who said what and why . 
  i just wanted to give an alternative explanation besides the `` europeans are cowards ! '', 
  line that gets often thrown around here . 
  edit : fixed formatting, 
  that may be true but it does n't prove your point . 
  i was briefly banned for `` trolling '' ( not kidding , that was the only reason , one word ) because i questioned the right 's narrative about thousands of wild muslims raping everybody in cologne . 
  so yeah , stupid bans may happen , but pretending its against criticism of immigration is wrong . 
  in any case i 'd love to see some data in hopes i will change my mind and accept the existence of this alleged bias . 
  only if you assume they are average * and * european . 
  i do n't think anywhere in europe do you get this insane rage/obsession with muslims . 
  unless you belong to specific political groups and attend specific events , its really not the average anywhere imho . 
  great ad hominem instead of addressing or even commenting on his point . 
  it was . 
  you are pretending that people simply `` disagreed '' with immigration and got banned . 
  that did not and does not happen . 
  do n't believe me ? 
  go ahead and oppose immigration and i promise you nobody will call you a nazi - i see it on posts here daily . 
  that does not happen . 
  no criticism has been banned . 
  what has been banned are people breaking the rules against racist speech and holocaust denial . 
   -2 years ago , you could get banned simply for being anti-immigration or anti-islam . 
  any evidence on that ? 
  or just the typical complaints against non-existing political correctness ? 
   i am so frustrated and annoyed by all the conspiracy theorists and ** racist ** bullshit . 
  please , please do n't write things like this . 
  allegedly there is no racism anymore , you are not allowed to use that word in a non-sarcastic fashion . 
  if you do , you will trigger the * concerned patriotic citizens * and they will start foaming at the mouth because omg political correctness is used to silence us and i ca n't take it anymore . 
  it 's the same thing really . 
   it does n't seem to get enforced often though ( or just interpreted very generously ) , or otherwise people at every party rally or even every campaign stall would be arrested by the truckload just for wearing shirts with their party 's logo on them . 
  that is because these people are usually not muslims . 
   muslim migration , 40 % retired people , poverty , income inequality and wealth , terrorists and saudi-arabia are all linked tho . 
  nobody views those problems as connected , unless he or she is an insane conspiracy theorist , or just pushing his or her political agenda very hard . 
  or both !, 
  climate change actually set off the syrian civil war . 
  but that does n't prevent people foaming at the mouth against muslims and islam , literally on every topic . 
  lets keep cc out of this , we do n't want facts sidelining our rage against muslims . 
   why exactly are we protesting the `` muslim takeover '' of germany ? 
  because there is an loosely organized and super angry group of people online ( of a very specific demographic ) that uses trolling , brigading and shitposting to further their right wing agenda . 
  in reality , the scope of this problem is orders of magnitude smaller than what they would have you believe . 
  reading some comments one would think that western civilization is literally collapsing right now ( people have said this explicitly ) when in reality immigration , with all its problems , is objectively low in the top 10 of problems we have . 
  this does n't mean that its not a problem nor that people should not be concerned ; it means that the angry anti-muslim and anti-left shitposting that is allowed here is clearly pushing an agenda and not rational discussion in any shape or form . 
   i simply meant that canada was there on more than one occasion , sending their young men and women off to die for somebody else . 
  that 's great , but you also said that europeans do n't want to defend themselves . 
  and i said , maybe that is not the case , maybe we had so much war in our own houses that we are not so eager to do it again . 
  i think its an understandable , if not normal , response . 
   you 're right that i have never experienced war but i sincerely doubt most people here have ( or will ) either . 
  i did n't mean you personally , i meant it culturally . 
  there are collective memories about what happens in a war what canadians do n't have , since all their fighting was overseas . 
  thanks for taking the time to let me know you are not , in fact , angry . 
  otherwise i would have mistaken your attempt at a putdown as a rational conversation . 
  on topic , i find it amusing that despite being wrong about the topic , you continue to push your agenda , probably because you know you will get support no matter what you say as long as its anti-muslim .

  its only `` fascists '' . 
  so we are allowed to ` hate ' anyone who has killed or raped the same number ( or more ? ), 
  of people as muslims have ? 
  so far , this must be the strangest post i 've read in / r/europe . 
  so baffling . 
  i do n't know what to say to that ` logic ' . 
   they are explicitly forbidden to leave the religion and it is rare to marry outside of it . 
  many wo n't even marry outside their own extended families . 
  there seems to be an utter unwillingness to compromise at all . 
  problem is we do n't apply the same standard to any non-muslim religious asshole . 
  i agree that muslims have the most crackpots , yet that does n't mean we have to exhaust our discipline on them , which is what most conservatives are arguing for ( directly on indirectly ) . 
  lets have laws against these socially damaging expressions of religions , for * all * religions . 
  this way you deal with these worrisome muslims , and large parts of the left would join you . 
  but of course this will never happen , because christianity might get in the crosshairs , and we do n't want that , do we ? 
  so we are stuck in this very un-european and un-democratic position of defending our culture form one ( 1 ) specific minority , while ignoring ( or even encouraging ) every other weirdo out there . 
  the polish acted tough against the muslims , like they would defend european civilization from them etc etc and what do they do now ? 
  they try to ban abortion . 
  fucking middle age barbarism , of a different color . 
  hypocrisy at its finest . 
  no good will come out of this . 
  its just shit all around . 
   i understand why you talk about our elections , but not why i have to endure so many lectures . 
  you probably have realized this already , but its because we are so terribly smug when it comes to the usa . 
  growing up in greece we had this term `` amerikanaki '' which means `` little american '' ( diminutive ) and is used when you want to call someone stupid . 
  so calling someone a little american means he is stupid . 
  this is literally racist but nobody gives a shit because its the usa . 
  and the clotheslines thing is one of the dumbest things ever . 
  how can someone believe that ? 
  yup , i agree with my conservative friends that feminism is not needed in the west . 
  bunch of hysterical weirdos . 
  clearly everything is fine and dandy !, 
  nope , the discussion was about greek and the workers there . 
  the public sector happened to be mentioned , and it was mentioned explicitly as a bad thing . 
  i counteracted with how both sectors suck and its wrong to single one out . 
  we are all workers in the end , right ? 
  look you do n't have to respond and downvote if you are not following the discussion . 
  i understand that i triggered you by daring to defend the public sector ( insanely unpopular opinion but i 'm crazy like that ... ) but please read the whole comment chain to understand my pov before barging in . 
  i thought you were done with this ? 
  well , i am . 
  just do n't forget to yell strawman one more time . 
  what agenda is being pushed here ? 
  muslim refugees pushing out the `` too well '' students ? 
  cool but i was n't the one to say `` working class ** minus ** the public sector '' . 
  i am not the one to draw lines . 
  i literally argued the opposite . 
  do n't break up the people between public and private because a ) one is approx . 
  just as fucking retarded as the other and b ) the working class extends to both groups . 
  so yeah i do n't know how you got the exact oppose from what i said . 
  maybe its the language , i dunno . 
   i know people like you . 
  they are the ones who believe that we are the best in the world , that everyone is jealous of us , that everyone is in a conspiracy against us , and they are exactly those people that are responsible for the country not recovering even six years after the burst of the crisis . 
  this is hilariously bizarre , considering i am nothing like that . 
  i am literally the opposite . 
  i think very little of greek culture ( yes i said it ) and do n't believe in any conspiracy theories : i think we fucked ourselves first and foremost . 
  most of these are valid points , i agree with most of them except  some areas of eu have 50 % unemployment , we do not need any more people . 
  there is no rule that says you need to have 0 % unemployment to take more people in . 
  there will always be unemployment , at which level its `` ok '' or `` not ok '' to invite more people is anyone 's guess . 
  also :  basically halt the flow of muslims into eu until we properly assess the threat and stop stirring up further trouble . 
  why specifically muslims and not `` refugees '' or `` immigrants '' in general ? 
  its things like these that make me immediately distrustful . 
  it sounds like someone has an agenda against a specific religious group . 
  strawman - you keep using that word , but you clearly are clueless as to what it actually means . 
  facts : nationalists are mistrustful and angry towards eu regardless of the quantity and quality of refugees . 
  nationalist do not want the eu , regardless of the number of terrorists attacks and their origin . 
  also you wo n't teach me what greeks are or how they behave . 
  that is a joke . 
  i 'm done here too . 
  when you are ready to face reality , send me a message . 
  you are the one who is dishonest ( but i am not the one to downvote you , because its actually part of the discussion ) if you pretend that conservatives/nationalists wanted the eu to begin with . 
  you literally hated it from the beginning . 
  you kept stoking the fires of anger , now with these terrorists attacks you act all self-righteous `` see !!!, 
  the eu does n't work !!!! '' . 
  you never wanted it to work . 
  you always hated the core concept behind it . 
  so all of this is hypocritical nonsense . 
  yes , the greeks are always pissed at the germans . 
  we could have zero refugees and greeks would still be screaming that merkel is a nazi and all that . 
  how do i know this ? 
  because it literally happened . 
  objective reality does not factor into the conservative/nationalist worldview . 
  you have your ideas and you stick to them no matter what happens in the external world . 
  you are welcome , but i may disappoint you yet ... because you understand why europeans talk about your elections , right ? 
  whoever gets to be in charge of the usa may or may not fuck up the world . 
  we are affected by it . 
  what if you invade other countries and we have to deal with the fallout ? 
  on the other hand , whatever happens with the refugees here does not affect you at all . 
  you have your military and diplomatic presence all over europe so you can just act via proxy , while your homes are safe and sound . 
  and obviously you are correct on the oddity of it . 
  its stupid for us to lecture you on who you should and should n't vote . 
  i am against trump but i do n't understand how he came to be , like where did he come from ? 
  so i wo n't post any long lectures about your mexican immigrants and whether you should build a wall ... its literally a different world over there . 
  yup . 
  lets be proactive by invading random countries . 
  countries that are conveniently far away from us , so that when refugees start flowing out of them , we 'll stick our heads in the sand and pretend its not our problem . 
  i think you need to get angrier . 
  that will help with that unity , lets get angrier and angrier and blame everyone else . 
  also lets continue to hypocritically pretend that immigration fucked up trust between eu nations . 
  its like all the conservatives/nationalist where so keen into this eu thing , they really wanted it , but then the filthy muslims came along and ruined it . 
  what a bunch of nonsense . 
  the fuck is unregulated immigration doing in this discussion ?

  people who come here must expect a shity treatment because we barely help our own people . 
  does n't it imply that they will be hosted in centers with food provided ? 
  who cares about the greeks ? 
  we are lazy ; we do n't count . 
  fun fact : during august all tickets to athens were booked because the island was full of tourists . 
  as a result these migrants got there but could n't leave and demanded a way to leave . 
  and what did they expect ? 
  to open any home and hotel that exists to house them ? 
  where do they think that we can host thousands of people ? 
  pretty insightful . 
  posts like this is the reason i love / r/europe despite the fact that people can start a flamewar at any moment . 
   a heavy burden on greece , but financial aid from europe will lessen it a lot . 
  that 's insane . 
  you ca n't expect us to support hundreds of thousands of immigrants while we process their asyum application . 
  if this happens i am afraid it will really boost golden dawn to power . 
  ( and if that happen sinking boats will be their answer ) . 
  i wonder how germans see the waiver of the eastern territories ? 
  i also wonder if it was about giving up those territories or just adjusting borders to reflect more the nationality of the people in these regions ? 
  was also a way to finally complete the unification and give an end to the legacy of wwii ? 
   nationalistic bullshit can you elaborate why this is more about nationalistic bullshit and not some brief presentation of historical facts ? 
   suspend dublin ii about fucking time . 
  our spineless politicians were promising to push for a change in dublim ii the last 10 or 15 years but did nothing actually . 
  now that the problem is reachin more countries we can wish for some change . 
  looks like a shitty political way out of the problem actually . 
  it was weird that merkel chose to accept so many people being from a conservativee party . 
  she did n't want to be accused of being racists so she decided to first let the situation get out of hand and afterwards act . 
   not purely about the economy its not even about the economy . 
  it is a monetary union . 
  not really . 
  it was the first time i noticed them on the map :p, 
  til estonia has a few islands . 
   but most importantly , without being in a federation , i ca n't vote merkel ( or whatever other politician ) out of office even though her political will and current control of the eu imposes shit on me . 
  that is not cool . 
  you can very well tell others to avoid voting for epp . 
  the leader of epp in the european parliament was in line with merkel on this . 
  one of the ways to reduce the power merkel has , would be to make epp weaker . 
  i am all for it but a key manager of siemens greece fled to germany and germany denies our request to testify against our politicians . 
  also the fact that the governments before syriza did n't want these officials to be convicted because they were people from the same parties . 
  nope , back then the lazy greeks were learning their lesson . 
  reminder : two world wars started in europe . 
  we are capable of the worst . 
  merkel does n't need a puppet in the comission in order to push for german interests . 
  she is strong enough to do that alone . 
  sounds familiar . 
  just do a research and see what they learn at their schools . 
  yeah , more like portugal changing its name to castile . 
  i hope they question the current economic dogma without burning everything to their ground . 
  he is refering to the policy that says that everyone can succeed being an economy with exports much higher than imports . 
  so far the main argument was that germany does n't have a surplus against other eurozone members but has higher exports for countries out of the eurozone . 
  this however leaves germany susceptible to instabilities in the chinese economy . 
  as if schengen is the problem . 
  the only way for a state to get away with getting immigrants is not getting out of schengen but buiding walls to surround its teritory . 
  do you think that this will improve the situation with the immigrants at the chunnel ? 
  i remember what a muslim guy told me that the quran has a hole part of it dedicated on how muslims are supposed to practice their religion in non muslim societies saying that it is essentialy a light form of islam . 
  i wonder how much of this is true , how homohenous islam is and how much these people have studied this if it is true . 
  right , neighter does the greek state support immigrants to leave the country , we just show the direction to germany . 
  yep , neo-nazis hate everyone so they do n't like cooperating with anyone . 
  but ukraine has started a route becoming closer to western europe and they have to accept that . 
   i think the situation got worse after merkel statement was released : every syrian refugee is welcome i doubt that . 
  we have been seeing the flow of people to increase last months . 
  around august when the weather was really good , it got worse as people were able to come in way larger numbers crossing the aegean . 
  you are just seeing the increase of flow that startes months ago ( and you will see it increasing till winter comes ) . 
  not really , it is just that the flow of people is reaching central europe and now the issue takes more publicity . 
   just too much for the system to take finally some sanity . 
  wanting to give some help is n't enough , you need the infrastructure to do it . 
  for small numbers it is fine but for larger numbers it is just impossible . 
  it 's funny how these neo nazis on the same time do n't want to be influenced by russia but do the same things russia do . 
  if they really think that they can get closer to western europe they need to have more western european values . 
  to spread propaganda you must pretend to be an idiot . 
  i expect to see the people comminh through the aegean to fall during the winter as the windter can get really bad . 
  yeah winder is coming : https://youtu.be/yka8qbc-2ms?t=59, 
  reminds me our politicians that want to return to our own currency . 
  so many people want their country to do things that are beyond their own powers . 
  just like they want to have a national currency that wo n't be devaluated like hell , some people there want to take control of some areas where they have de facto lost control of . 
   realizes there 's something referred to as lagarde list trust me , they realized it right from the beginning . 
  the reason an ex minister of economics hid the only copy for some time shows how well they realise the implications of investigating it . 
  yes , if op is talking about this one then the title is inaccurate : https://uk.news.yahoo.com/massive-ancient-greek-city-discovered-104005218.html#zv5jnjt you ca n't see any mention of the ship in the article either . 
  the article says that `` was the size of around 10 football fields , covering an area of 12 acres . '' . 
  the pictures are indeed not much clear . 
  i 'll try to find some mention online but i 'm not sure it can be found . 
  i got the information from the archeologist that was working on the site . 
  what she said is that one day the people who worked on the ship were taking a break in a nearby beach and after taking a look at the sea floor they realized that what was there looked like ruins of an ancient city ( that was never documented ) . 
  the ship was indeed searching for a city but not exactly this one . 
  imo it is practical if you want to search the sea floor, 
  he is refering to this one : https://uk.news.yahoo.com/massive-ancient-greek-city-discovered-104005218.html#zv5jnjt, 
  this ship was indeed searching for an underwater city in the area but it was not found by it actually :p, 
  just for the record , according to the news here the boat that located the smugglers was operating under frontex . 
  let 's put the line at white christians . 
  if we say that we accept only white and christians everyone will be happy , right ? 
  how much time does it take right now for an asylum application to be processed in germany ? 
  you forgot a few words : `` please send more syrian refugees , we will send them back ourselves '', 
  you realise that what germany did is that they will merely process all these asylum applications and have the responsibility to send them back in case their application is rejected ? 
  this is n't really saying that they will accept all refugees no matter what . 
  remember that it was the german cancelor who had the guts to say to a little girl that she is not eligible to asylum and made her break in tears . 
   uhmm ... not only this sub , but it seems europe as a whole is transforming into a news about immigration . 
  it 's a weird sensation , knowing , that this is going to get worse and worse and worse . 
  and i 'm not exaggerating that my fears is that we will have some semi-hitler to deal with in 10 years . 
  the situation is really chaotic and it challenges the values we have int europe after the end of wwii . 
  there is a huge stream of people from turkey towards central europe . 
  it always existed but now it is huge .

  the measures were quite many pages , and the time the imf gave greece to decide the deal was quite short , so short parliamentarians did n't even had enough time to read the pages of the damn deal ... 
  so they basically voted for the deal without knowing what they were voting for ... 
  it turned out that with that deal greece became ` locked ' to the imf , and the imf got authorities that perhaps it should n't . 
  now as for greece 's public sector ... my main gripe with it is n't its size , but the laxity and laziness of public employees . 
  there is this weird law that i do n't like , that says that people who are employed in the public sector should not loose their jobs . 
  like your superior in the job ca n't fire you , if you are working on the public sector . 
  this law has lead to a culture of laziness in the public sector that i despise . 
  because many public workers are like ( since nobody is going to fire me , why bother doing my job properly ? ) . 
  so the main problem with greece 's public sector is that its workers have very low productivity . 
  if there were as productive as private workers , the public services would be so much better , so more functional and helpful to the citizens ... 
  so yes , there was a problem with a dysfunctional and oversized public sector . 
  but that 's not what raised our debt so high , neither what caused the market depression , and the high unemployment rates . 
  what raised greece 's debt too high , is mostly 2 things : 1 ) public spending . 
  but pay attention here : not spending as in giving very high pensions to pensioners , that the troika would have you to believe , but public spending as in , the minister going to a cafe and charging a 200 euros bill to the state for a single day out on the cafe ... 
  there have been numerous scandals of politicians over-charging the state , with siemens like scandals too . 
  the siemens scandal was just one of the many ... basically for stuff like infrastructure works etc , a minister would sign a contract with a private corporation secretly with ` unfair competition ' ways , but the private corporation would charge the government multiple times the normal price for their services . 
  in return , the private corporation would put a considerable amount of that extra money to the private banking account of the minister ... 
  corruption basically , at its purest form . 
  that way , greece 's government would pay for the construction of let 's say a single bridge , the equivalent money for 2,3,5 bridges ... and well , the debt would rise up higher than it should . 
  2 ) recapitalization of banks . 
  the greek government took loans of many billions from other banks , indebting greek citizens , to give that money to 4-5 private local banks . 
  a very unpopular move . 
  ideally yes . 
  but all that time the management of the whole story has been anything but ideal . 
  but but ... it 's counter productive !, 
  : o supposedly , the goal is for greece 's government to raise its profits , so it does n't have to be bailed out . 
  if raising the tax rates reduces consumption and sends businesses away so much that the government 's profits are reduced , there is no point in it . 
  perhaps . 
  but that 's fighting the symptom , not the disease . 
  it 's like couch syrup , not antibiotics . 
  i 've no problem with changes in the way the government works , or reducing beurocracy , or other similar stuff to make greece 's government spend less and also easier for businesses to operate . 
  but i think the tax raises that usually accompany austerity packs are bad . 
  :( for the reason i stated in my main comment . 
  i 'll tell you what i 'd do back in 2010 , where shit hit the fan and greece started applying austerity measures . 
  austerity measures are composed of two things : cuts on government spending , and raising up tax rates . 
  of these two , i 'd keep cutting down government spending , starting by the richest . 
  did you knew that the appointed ceo of greece 's public electricity company was getting paid 200.000 euros per month ? 
  instead of cutting the old lady 's pension from 600 euros to 400 euros , i 'd cut this motherfucker 's ( and to the others like him ) monthly salary to 10.000 euros per month . 
  still quite much though . 
  i 'd also cut the wages of public workers much . 
  i 'd also change the law that makes it so public workers ca n't be fired from their jobs . 
  yes , that 's right , in greece , once you become a public worker and start working for the government , the government ca n't fire you !, 
  this law has lead many public employees in greece to be lazy unproductive slackers . 
  since nobody can fire them , they barely work , and yet still get paid . 
  so i 'd change things so if someone is a slacker and is not as productive as he should be , he would loose his job . 
  but i would n't raise the taxes . 
  the raises in taxes are that caused all the negative things to happen in greek economy the last 7 years . 
  because raises to tax rates have the following effects in a globalized economy : 1 ) reduce the buying power of the citizens , leading to reduced consumption , and as a result to recession and eventually market depression , which translates to reduction of gdp . 
  2 ) make international corporations move their facilities to other countries with lower tax rates , leaving people behind without jobs . 
  since 2010 , 18 % of greece 's population lost its jobs because businesses moved to other countries with lower tax rates . 
  if these millions of people had n't lost their jobs , they would get income , and that income would be taxed , and the government would collect money out of it . 
  and maybe it would n't have to take loans , or at least it would only need to take smaller loans . 
  and if the consumption had n't dropped , again , businesses would make more money , which is always a good thing . 
  not really . 
  let 's say that greece 's debt is cut by half . 
  so what ? 
  would that bring new businesses in greece to power up growth ? 
  with such high tax rates , businesses will go to malta , bulgaria , or some other country with low tax rates . 
  the country with the lower taxes gets the most businesses , and the higher the amount of bussinesses there are , the higher the gdp a country has . 
  malta has 5 % business tax . 
  greece has up to 52 % business tax . 
  if you wanted to start a new business , would you open it at a country that takes 5 % out of your money , or 52 % ? 
  well guess which of the two countries have a better economy . 
  the one with the lower tax rates of course !, 
  it 's that simple . 
  there used to be companies in greece ... before austerity measures . 
  the unemployment rate was 9 % at 2009 . 
  now , after austerity measures , its 27 % . 
  here is what happened : the austerity measures basically elevated taxes quite much . 
  in an isolated economy perhaps this would have the desired effects , and bring more money to the government . 
  but we live in a globalized market . 
  so when greece started applying the new higher taxes , companies started fleeing greece for poorer countries with lower tax rates , leaving thousands of people without jobs behind . 
  with so high tax rates in greece right now , and with the german finmin wanting even higher tax rates in greece , there is absolutely no reason for a company to go to greece . 
  the opposite is more logical to happen , and even more companies will leave greece for other countries with newer tax hikes . 
  after all , the goal of companies is to maximize profits . 
  of course it would , was there anyone who did n't expected it ? 
  from 1 / 1 / 2017 even newer austerity measures were added on top of the already existing . 
  and every time new austerity measures are applied , the gdp falls some amount . 
  i 'd expect everyone would knew this by now , as it has been happening for 7 years now each time newer austerity measures applied . 
  and why it happens is pretty simple : the more expensive something is , the less people will buy it . 
  raise in taxes , raises end prices . 
  from one point and on , the taxes elevate the price of a good or service so much , people stop using it en mass because it 's too damn expensive . 
  and in the end less profits are gained . 
  because although the amount of tax money per individual sale the government collects is higher , the overall number of sales go so much down that the government ends up collecting less tax money overall . 
  and that is the main argument anti-austerity people have against austerity . 
  actually the church became a public service owned by the government and ran by the political power , from the moment it became official , by emperor constantine of the roman empire . 
  why not the best of both worlds ? 
  in many greek restaurants , at least in greece , there is a variation of souvlaki that is called `` cotobacon '' . 
  it has small pieces of chicken wrapped with fried bacon . 
  it rocks !, 
  xd the word gyros and gyroscope come from the root gyr - which means rotation . 
  so gyros meat is named like that because it is placed on a large stick that rotates , and well , gyroscopes rotate too !, 
  it 's interesting . 
  because here , when they say they sell kebap , what they sell is lamb ` meatballs ' , although they do n't have a ball shape , but a long shape . 
  but gyros is n't made with minced meat , but whole pieces of meat . 
  i thought that it kind of goes against the value of freedom of speech . 
  but then again , i 'm from greece , which tolerates a stalinistic communist party , and a neonazi party for the shake of freedom of speech . 
  but to they do such things ? 
  if they do , she is innocent . 
  since when telling the things as they are and not trying to hide reality is a bad thing ?

  also i read the article and i saw that there exists an american town called ypsilanti ? 
  wtf . 
  can they even pronounce it ? 
  i think our friend zoolbarian is talking about the so-called `` strong ai '' . 
  which , i think , can only be achieved by neural nets . 
   you can be wrong on your own interest as well . 
  such is life . 
  sure , but my point was that you can determine your self-interest . 
  you can figure it out . 
  but our collective self-interest ? 
  that seems to be literally impossible . 
   in most civilized countries , our representatives do . 
  which is pretty similar when we elect them . 
  true . 
  i have not encountered an example such as yours . 
  it would be interesting to find out , but i 'd have to go through the records of the greek parliament and who wants to do that . 
   in many cases you can reasonably assume you wo n't end up there depends on who you are . 
  for me and many greek people , it is very much a possibility . 
  but it might be a possibility for everyone , not just greeks . 
  you are gon na live what , like 5 more decades ? 
  6 if you are healthy , 7 if you are young and healthy . 
  chances are , you will suffer another financial crisis during these decades . 
  maybe more than one . 
  such is capitalism . 
  you might end desperate for work despite your education and experience . 
   empathy does exist , even if it is not necessarily a driving force of our society . 
  amen to that !, 
  i think it is an uncommon worry , but i hope you are right and i am wrong . 
  also , it kind of is unprecedented . 
  i am not sure if anyone is paying attention . 
  what is the next country that faces serious problem with climate change ? 
  syria is a done deal but what about the next one ... are we even talking to them ? 
   dlc-type democrats is being democrat a dlc now ? 
  tbh i would n't pay more than 10 cents for that but seriously , my point was not that clinton is a `` popular '' politician . 
  even typing that feels wrong . 
  i am arguing against the notion that they were out of touch with the common man . 
  this opinion is endlessly parroted on reddit and usually receives gold . 
  you know , the `` hurr durr liberals are so smug and out of touch '' trope . 
  not true . 
  if you win the popular vote , even by a small margin , you ca n't be out of touch . 
  you might still suck ( as hillary did ) but you are definitely not in any fucking ivory tower as the altzis claim, 
   seems to me you are doing exactly what you are accusing op of doing . 
  nope . 
  i can prove it to you . 
  let 's assume i got it wrong and indeed people disagree with her . 
  i can accept that . 
  but that does not prove that she is a `` political elite '' who is `` out of tune with society '' . 
  it means she fucked up on one issue . 
  the accusations you guys are making , and the language you are using , are really out of scope for a normal discussion . 
  all this reads like the shitty political pamphlets i read during my college days , the ones angsty/edgy young dudes wrote and distributed to convert people to their cause . 
  yeah man , in an alternative timeline everything goes according to your grand plan reality is more tricky though : /, 
   this is obviously a hard question . 
  but sometimes it is possible to agree on an answer . 
  we can agree on anything you want , but it wo n't make it true . 
   i do n't know about that . 
  in fact i 'm pretty sure it happened already many times . 
  whenever a law is passed that benefits a few , for a small compromise on many . 
  we do n't vote on laws , though . 
  so that is not a good example . 
  even if we voted on laws , hypothetically speaking , we do n't know what motivates people to vote the way they do . 
  i 'd vote for regulations on the workspace environment even if it cost me as a consumer . 
  why ? 
  selfish reasons : i might end up doing manual labor so i 'd want these safety regulations . 
  it is like a safety net to me and costs very little . 
   that doesnt mean every billioner is a political elite ... no , only the ones you disagree with, 
  nobody said he was . 
  i imagine it was people like farage , like a lot of angry anti-eu people that frequent this sub , that op was talking about . 
  lol what kind of scientist are you . 
  a political one perhaps ? 
  well you can repeat it as often as you like but it does n't make it true . 
  trump is a billionaire republican . 
  more people voted for clinton than him . 
  calling these people `` establishment '' or `` liberal elites '' is disgusting . 
  really speaks volumes about the hypocrisy of the right . 
  i wonder , when will you accept that germany wo n't be a third world nation ? 
  what is your criteria ? 
  if anything , they are moving towards the opposite direction , by every metric . 
  so what if germany does * not * end up a third world country ? 
  will you change your views ? 
  lol i totally misread your comment . 
  lets forget about it, 
   you just have this weird idea that any country or people who want something different from yourself must have either a massive ego or are doing it out of spite . 
  what a weird idea !, 
  i mean , have you ever listened to farage speaking ? 
  that 's interesting but i am not sure if we have the data to back it up . 
  my point was to argue against the notion that its `` people '' vs `` establishment '' . 
  it is not . 
  it is people vs people , as always . 
   not if we could somehow prevent that . 
  i do n't think so . 
  even if we had the technology , it would be silly because that 's 5 billion years in the future . 
  my view is that the hysteria about some issues is inversely proportional to their impact . 
  it is almost as if we humans care more about vague abstract ideas ( clash of civilizations ! ), 
  than the real problems we face in our daily lives . 
  ca n't tell you how many fucking times i 've heard that our civilization will end . 
  of all these times , only one ( 1 ) was an actual and valid thread : climate change . 
  pretty ironic that the same morons who talk about the collapse of civilization due to refugees are the same people who deny climate change exists . 
  tl/dr ; we are truly fucked as a species . 
  do you realize the aegean sea is made out of water ? 
  we do n't call it a `` sea '' for shits and giggles .
